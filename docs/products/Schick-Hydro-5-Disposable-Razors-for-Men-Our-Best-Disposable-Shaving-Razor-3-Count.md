<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am sick of ladies razors they never do a really good job of shaving and I do not have particularly thick or coarse hair but ladies razors never seem to do the trick. So I got this razor to see if more blades would do a better job and boy did they. A MUCH closer, smoother and cleaner shave on my underarms and legs. I think I will be using these men&#x27;s razors from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gave it four stars because I have never used any other men&#x27;s razors but compared to all the different women&#x27;s razors these are a five star item!</li>
    <li> I do like these quite a bit.  I prefer them over the similar models you have to buy replacement blades for.  Very smooth and slick.  No cuts.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro 5 has two main advantages over my usual three-blade razors -- either the Gilette Mach 3 or the store brand from Target, depending on how ready I am on a given day to start throwing the big bucks around. First, the shave is noticeably smoother. Second, I suppose because the cutting work is spread out over more blades, they last significantly longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I confirmed these results, as I did when testing another five-blade razor, the [[ASIN:B005ACNPKA Remington King of Shaves Azor 5 Blade]], by dividing my shaves halfway down my face and using this razor on one side and a brand-new Target store brand on the other. Even when brand new, this razor feels smoother than the three-blade. After a few weeks of usage, the difference was very noticeable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, I find the Schick Hydro 5 awkward and bulky when doing what I need to do. I maintain a beard, and I need a razor to do three things: keep my neck clean and define the lower line of my beard at the jaw, shave the few little hairs that grow wolfman-like up my cheeks at the top of the beard, and keep the back of my neck clean shaven. The back of the neck is fine, but the large size of the shaving head makes it more difficult to keep a straight line maintained at the bottom of the beard. With the more manageable and finely maneuverable three-blade head, shaving a straight line at the neck is a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have spoken about the hydrating gel. I honestly can&#x27;t speak to that. I use shaving cream, and all I really notice is that the razor is cutting under an eighth of an inch of foam. I can&#x27;t speak well as to what gel is coming out of the razor at the bottom of all that foam, and I don&#x27;t see how others could either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the bottom line is yes, five blades does make a difference as far as I can tell, in terms of both a smooth, comfortable shave and longer lasting razors. However, if your aim is to keep a beard trimmed, you&#x27;ll do better with a smaller, higher-precision razor head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if I shaved my whole face, I would prefer this razor over the three-blade heads I generally use.gher-precision razor head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if I shaved my whole face, I would prefer this razor over the three-blade heads I generally use.</li>
    <li> OK, maybe that&#x27;s a slight exaggeration, but I can honestly say the shave from the Schick Hydro 5 is beyond close!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this would be for a guy, but it&#x27;s a great razor for shaving a flat swath of leg. Very easy, very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually didn&#x27;t have to use it again for almost two weeks, and when I did, the five razors were as sharp as if they were new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe five razors is overkill, but it works great on leg hair. The price is problematic, but if anything, it saves time and money in not having to shave as often.</li>
    <li> These are great disposable razors. You don&#x27;t even have to use a shave cream. They give a close, smooth shave without any irritation at all. I even did my bikini area with no shaving cream and did not have any irritation at all. Yes, I am a female using and reviewing a mens razor. I have used mens razors for the past 20 years because they always provide a closer, smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each razor lasts through several shaves, even after the moisturizing strip has worn off. After that wears off, you can just use shaving cream and still get a nice, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I believe Schick makes the best razors, period. Disposable or refillable, I always go back to Schick. I like this version much better than the womens Schick Hydro Silk, too - there are differences between them.</li>
    <li> I liked this razor.  It did exactly what it was supposed to do.  I didn&#x27;t feel like there was anything special about it.  It had a moisture strip and multiple blades like all the other razors I buy.  It did feel just a little bit heavier than other razors I&#x27;ve used, but otherwise, not much of a difference.  I would recommend it for a nice, clean shave.</li>
    <li> I use the disposable razors occasionally when I don;t have time to wax. I love that I don;t have to use the shaving cream, just water is enough.&lt;br /&gt;Never had any cuts and all unwanted hair is gone. Can not complain and it beats super cheap disposables that are rough and dull half way first use!</li>
    <li> Folks have commented that these are expensive, but unlike a few other disposable brands, these are reusable for the short term. I highly recommend them for vacations or pretty much taking anywhere that isn&#x27;t your personal bathroom. One of these will suffice for a week long vacation. The blades and the head seem to be nearly identical to the regular Schick hydro (comparing them side by side as I write this), but the handle is cheaper quality, and there is cheaper, flimsier plastic on the razor head itself. Still, it nicks a lot less than the cheaper disposable blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts? Great for travel. Can be reused several times. Good quality.</li>
    <li> First I should admit that I rarely use disposable razors, if only because of my concerns about the environment, but I have been testing and using these for the last two months. Compared with the Fusion non-disposable, the shave you get from these is not as good. I find that I need to shave more often and I can also feel the difference. However, these still provide and very comfortable and close shave. They are probably among the best disposables you can get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of disposables. They lack quality and wear out quickly. I was surprised by the Schick Hydro. One cool feature is the thumb-switch trimming tool. Pretty cool and it works really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my complaints about disposables is that the manufacturers are more concerned with fitting more and more razors on the head, making us all believe that the more razors, the closer the shave, which is completely untrue. Five razors? Most countries in the world don&#x27;t have enough clean water to drink, but we in the USA need five razors on our shavers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, maybe five razors is overkill. The Schick Hydro would likely be the same shaver with two or three razors. But it&#x27;s a great disposable. I&#x27;m thirsty.</li>
    <li> So obviously if I&#x27;m giving this razor 4 stars it&#x27;s good for more than just travel use, but that is what it will be used for in our household.  I use an [[ASIN:B004TGUKG0 epilator]] with the occasional disposable razor at times and my boyfriend uses his [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic Nanotech Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Electric Shaver]] regularly.  He had even taking to traveling with it until recently when somehow it was left behind at the hotel....over 150 miles away.  Thankfully it is a location that we return to often and we were able to retrieve it, but after that it was decided that it would no longer travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B00AHF1GK6 Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor]] provides a smooth, close, easy shave with no irritation.  He has used it in the shower and at the sink, bith having similar results.  Additionally the 5 blades do seems to provide a slightly better shave than the Mach 3 he had used in the past.  Overall a good quality disposable razor that you won&#x27;t feel the need to retrieve if it gets left behind.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. I usually get around 16 shaves out of one razor and the comfort starts after the second shave; for some reason shave 1 and 2 just tend to ooze to much hydro gel out that causes clogging and makes my face just way to slick. I still gave it 5 stars for providing a nice comfortable close shave.</li>
    <li> I received a pack of these razors as part of a promotions and they are great!  they have a &amp;#34;Flip Trimmer&amp;#34; that lets me get my mustache around my nose and precisely shave my beard.  It has nice lubrication so I don&#x27;t get any razor burn, and NO CUTS.</li>
    <li> The blades shave great and I really like the flip back feature. However the flip top locks the blades in place, and the gel is a little too slimy for me. If the flip top didn&#x27;t lock the blades I would give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> These razors are great. To begin with they are disposables and they are pretty darn good, no other disposable even comes close. My skin is really sensitive and had no problem shaving. The 5 blades are great and give you a tight smooth shave. The moisture that the razor provides is great and helps you with the shaving, basically you don&#x27;t need shaving gel with these because they pact so much moisture. Great shave, definitely a cheaper replacement from non disposables also must be great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THE SCHICK HYDRO 5!!!! I got this for free from BzzAgent. I have always never used disposables because my skin gets irritated really easily. Now I have more faith in disposables. The aloe and things on the razor make it such a smoother shave than other disposables. I have so far used 1 of my $3 coupons and have shared them with the other guys in my family. Rate 5 stars!! make sure to share what you think too!</li>
    <li> So, first and foremost, I&#x27;ll start off by saying that my immediate comparison for the Schick Hydro 5 disposables ended up being the Gillette Fusion Proglide.  This in and of itself is a huge success for the Schick disposable.  Throughout my first experience with it, I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure that the Gillette had any advantages over the Schick disposable.  If you weren&#x27;t able to see what you were using, I&#x27;m not sure you would not know you were using a disposable.  This really is a great shave product, and as long as the pricing advantage holds up (I&#x27;ll have to do more research here), I seriously may find myself converting over.</li>
    <li> After trying the new Schick Hydro 5 disposables as part of a Bzzagent promotion, I was blown away by what a comfortable shave I was able to get. Not only did the razor glide comfortably and remove my stubble without any pulling or discomfort, but because of the hydrating gel reservoir, it left my face feeling smooth, soft, and completely hydrated. One other thing I loved was both the shape and feel of the razor handle, as well as the awesome ability to pull back the top of the razor to give me a fine cutting edge for sideburns. This is a high quality product that I was very impressed with.</li>
    <li> I picked this up on a whim this week. I have always been a fan of Schick, but haven&#x27;t used any of their 5 blade razors. I have a Quatro and it works well for me. So here goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice handle. It is made of plastic (go figure its disposable), but has a nice rubbery texture that makes it really grippy. I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp and allow me to shave really well. I have a sensative face and usually get razor burn. I didn&#x27;t with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last. These aren&#x27;t those one time use and then trash them razors. I can easily use them for week or more before tossing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is nice. It has essentially the same head as the cartridge and handle version at a little cheaper of a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hmmm. It does feel cheap, then again it is a disposable.</li>
    <li> We have finally found a disposable razor that can even closely compare to refillable blades.  I have sworn of disposables for years, my problem is with the consistency of shaves from blade to blade.  The Hydro has put that fear to rest.</li>
    <li> I received a three pack of these as a promotion from Schick and I found these razors provide a very close and quick shave. My face was left very smooth with no razor burn. On the down side I found that the razor felt bulky and hard to trim with even with the flip down moisturize strip. I would however recommend this razor to anyone who likes multiple blades. Its just not for me. I&#x27;ll stick to twin blades razors.</li>
    <li> Awesome Gel reservoir&lt;br /&gt;I like this razor especially for traveling when I don&#x27;t want to lug around my everyday razor/mangrooming kit. The gel reservoir has to be my favorite feature leaving you with a shave as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom every time. The flip up trimming feature is decent not the best I have seen but awesome for a disposable razor. #GotItFree #BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product as part of a BzzAgent campaign.  The Schick Hydro fits comfortably in your hand and glides smoothly across your face.  I thought that the flip trimmer was a stupid gimmick until I tried it.  It made it very easy to shave the area just below my nostrils, which usually requires me to make a number of absurd faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the razor just does not cut close enough.  I believe this is because the blades are so close together.  However the blades being so close together is probably what makes it feel so smooth.  In the end it is a good razor, but I will probably continue to use my ancient Mach 3.</li>
    <li> These are a great product. I have tried many razors in the past and these definitely do the job.  As a teacher, I have to look my best and shaving with these razors get me ready for the day.  They leave a clean shave and the flip and trim feature is a terrific aspect of the razor that makes it one of my top choices.  Having received a sample set of these razers from BzzAgent for free to try helped me pick these razors up.</li>
    <li> These razors are amazing...keeps your skin mmoisterized got these free as i am a bzzagent and was really impressed these are not your ordinary they last long have a skin gaurd to protect against razor burn these are better then the other brands. I would recommend. These to everyone no nore dry skinn</li>
    <li> I would never use disposable razors prior to this, but my opinion has changed. I shave a lot and having a smooth shave is important. These razors did the job, and did it well. It was so smooth and it didn&#x27;t pull longer hairs like many other razors do.</li>
    <li> I belong to a razor club online but I have to say the Schick disposable hydro 5 is a really good razor.  Smooth cut, easy grip handle, and gentle on the skin. I will definitely be purchasing some of these especially for when I travel.</li>
    <li> I am very, very impressed with these razors.  Had been using another brand but was given a few of these to try and I could not believe how smooth and close a shave I got.  It literally glides over my face - amazing for a disposable razor.  Great value and incredible shave!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro Razor for testing. Until then, I did not know much about the Schick brand. I have been a long time user of Gillette and all their line ups. I must admit that Schick has gotten my interest and I may become a convert.&lt;br /&gt;To begin, I like the packaging of the product. You just peel it and you have access to the razor. You do not need to get a knife and scissors. This is very convenient. Holding it is convenient as well. It has an ergonomic rubber grip that provides better control, and nice range of motion.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I tested this for about two weeks, and I am here to say that this is one of the best razors that I have used.  I did not feel much friction at all between the cartridge and my skin. The hydrating gel reservoir really works. I later tested it without shaving cream. It did work very well as well. Although, I did feel the after effect. Therefore, do not throw your shaving cream away for a non-irritant after shave experience.&lt;br /&gt;This razor works as expected and even surprised me. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Thanks #SCHICK and #BzzAgent. These razors give you a nice close shave. The razors have a moisturizing gel built into them that helps it glide on your skin. I received the Men&#x27;s Hydro Schick 5 Disposable Razors #FREE in a Bzz campaign. Will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro razor was a great disposable razor, but it loses it&#x27;s sharpness after a couple of days and it doesn&#x27;t get the closer shave on the face like it did. Even though it&#x27;s a nice razor, I didn&#x27;t like there is no side grips like other disposable companies have added, to avoid from slipping out of your hands.</li>
    <li> I received these through a survey from BzzzAgent. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them. I have been a Mach3 user for 10 years and was always happy with the shave they provided. These Hydro 5&#x27;s are a game changer for me! I was shocked that I couldn&#x27;t feel the blades on my skin at all. Super close shave and no irritation after I finished, even in hard to shave areas!</li>
    <li> Got these free from Bzzagent to review.  To be honest I thought it was a decent shave but not really the closest shave.  That means you likely won&#x27;t get cut with these but I don&#x27;t know that they were really better than an electric razor.  The hydrating strips can be useful if you don&#x27;t use shave gel or cream, but I found they were more of a gimmick.</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent, which means I received a free sample of these razors to review them and give my opinion on them.  So far, so good!  I have been using the razors for about a week and a half and they are performing great!  The hydrating oils that activate when there is water on your face is a very nice feature.  I don&#x27;t like to use shaving cream or gels, just hot water when I am done showering and it produces a nice clean shave.  They seem to last for at least 6 shaves before start to dull out and the grip is light weight and comfortable.  My wife started using one on her legs and she likes it much better then her razor and she will probably fight me for the third one in the 3 pack.  Ultimately, its a high quality razor and I feel its worth the price.  The only negative is that I have to shave slightly more often.</li>
    <li> I received the Men&#x27;s Hydro Schick 5 Disposable Razors #FREE in a Bzz campaign. I had the great pleasure to try this product out for #free because I am a #BzzAgent. I really like the razors because first of all I noticed the soft rubber grip of the handle that fits just right into my hand. The grip allows me to use either hand and easily shave both sides of my face. I also love that it has 5 blades. I can get a close, clean shave without the worry of cutting myself. The water activated gel with aloe vera and vitamin E  hydrates my skin while I shave. I love this product so much and #IGOTITFREE for being a #BzzAgent. Thanks #SCHICK.</li>
    <li> I just tried this disposable razor and I was pleasantly surprised!!!  (Received as a free sample)&lt;br /&gt;It provided an extremely close, comfortable shave and most importantly, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  As a matter of fact, my face felt refreshed afterwards and stayed refreshed the entire day.  My only complaint about the razor is that it was much lighter than my normal razor and didn&#x27;t glide through my 5 day growth.  But for a disposable razor it was extraordinary.  Best disposable I have ever used.</li>
    <li> So I have been using Mach 3 for many, many years.  I believe this razor, especially on the first three uses, shaves better.  The reason it shaves better is because it gets closer due to more blades (5 instead of 3) and makes shaving faster due to a larger head.  If you are using it to shave your face, you will get about five uses out of it.  On to the negative...the space between the top blade and the top of the head is too much. This makes shaving right under your nose impossible.  I found myself shaving everything with the hydro, then using the Mach 3 to get the hair right under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: just learned that you can flip the top down to expose the blades. I can get closer to the hairs right below my nose than the Mach 3! This rating has gone from three to five stars.  I have a new razor ladies and gentlemen!</li>
    <li> I got to try these for free as part of a BzzAgents campaign, and I&#x27;m glad I did. They gave me a much closer, smoother shave than I would have thought, and have been good enough that I may consider leaving my usual mail-order brand I&#x27;ve been using! Beware the moisture bar on top. When it gets too wet it leaves a gummy, slimy trail on your face after each stroke. Otherwise a good product that I would try Again!</li>
    <li> These razors are really something. Excellent product. A must have for every shave enthusiast. The best part is that I received it for free as a promotion from the brand and BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> These were great blades.  Very close shave and a great value.</li>
    <li> I received a free pack from bzzagent. I was expecting these disposables to wear out fairly quickly, however, after several uses, I feel confident in saying that if I wanted to, I would reuse these disposables. The razors shaved cleanly and I felt like I did not feel the need to use any kind of shaving cream. I highly recommend these razors. Not only are they a good price, but also they are high quality.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best disposable razor out there i do believe that I will be switching back to disposable razors nic clean shave gets close the first time only have to go over my face once and it does the job</li>
    <li> Overall a good razor! I feel very refreshed and comfortable after the shaving. Will recommend to men with sensitive skins.</li>
    <li> My initial thoughts on the Hydro...it provides a smooth and effortless shave...better than any disposable I&#x27;ve ever used. Tamed my facial forest in much the same manner that Mike Tyson crushed Michael Spinks. Kudos Schick! Not to mention that I&#x27;ve been able to re-use the same blade several times over (I wanted to see how long it took before degradation of the blade occurred).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little relativity always helps...When I first started shaving back in the 80&#x27;s, I was a blade man like my dad. Wore toilet tissue bandaids like a badge of honor. As I got older, I moved to electric shavers, specifically the Brauns. No more nicks and cuts, but never a close shave either. Then I found the Gillette Fusion, which I&#x27;ve been using for several years and it provides a great shave...but, the blades are incredibly costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine the Schick Hydro5 will be my new &amp;#34;go-to.&amp;#34; Great shave at a better price than the Fusion.</li>
    <li> I got these as a free sample from BzzAgent and was completely blown away. I had no idea disposable razors could be so comfortable and effective! I normally use Gillette brand, and my non-disposable razor has nothing on these. The 5 blades get super close with just one pass and the hydrating gel actually works! It makes a slimy coating, that I think has totally reduced the amount of razor burn I usually get. If Shick&#x27;s disposable razors are this good, I definitely will rethink what brand I am buying in the future because my current razor is a waste of money. I would definitely buy these again, especially for a trip so I could just toss them afterwards.</li>
    <li> While these razors did give me a close shave, there are better ones available. The heads of the razors are too bulky and large to do any tight areas (under the nose, or accurately shave sideburns). The amount of lotion on the top of the razor left my face feeling like I&#x27;d just gotten slimed by Slimer in Ghostbusters. My wife however really liked them for shaving her legs where there is a lot more &#x27;open&#x27; area with long strokes. I got these razors as a trial run from bzzagent. Glad they were free as I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them myself</li>
    <li> Great razors. Package was split open when it arrived but there was no damage to the contents</li>
    <li> These razors never leave you with a nick, which means no bleeding!!! Does a great job for everyday use, but sometimes has a hard time getting into hard to reach places, like under your chin, becuase the head does not rotate. I use these for everyday use, but when I have a more formal event, I prefer to use a nicer razor. I was given one of these by Schick to give my honest feedback, and I think that I&#x27;m going to subscribe to these on Amazon beucase they do a great job.</li>
    <li> I received these razors from a promotion by #Schick and #Bzzagent to test out. Overall, they were pretty decent. I got 15 scruffy shaves out of them before mild razorburn, but the lubricating strip quit after 7 shaves. The edging techbnology works really well! I highly recommend if you have the extra money to try these out!</li>
    <li> So, all my shaving years, about 20 now, I&#x27;ve always used disposable razors.  I would use them until they started removing more than just whiskers to get my moneys worth.  Recently I made the jump from multi-blade razors to old fashioned safety razors.  They worked for my Grandpop, who taught me how to shave, so they should work for me.... Right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they do.  I love them.  I&#x27;ve never had a smoother shave (after I got used to them).  That said, to travel with a safety razor, shaving soap, a lather brush, and after shave, it&#x27;s a pain.  Theres always a risk of getting nicked by a blade regardless of &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; or not.  Enter the Schick Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently we took a week long family vacation. I figured perfect time to try this out!  I packed only 1 Schick Hydro 5 razor.  I guess now is a good time to mention I have a full beard, but still need to shave my upper cheeks, neck, and around the back of my ears (I shave my head also).  The Schick Hydro 5 did very well, considering I&#x27;m used to single blade shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no razor burn, the blades got surprisingly closer than I remember versus other disposables that I am trying to remember.  My face remained hydrated with the moisture strip on the blade, the trimming blade was great for my hair line, and I was able to manipulate the razor to shave blind, behind my ears and keep all skin intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep these around as a backup, or for traveling.  I won&#x27;t be switching my safety razor out any time soon thought.  I will say they did a good job, but other than a straight razor, I don&#x27;t think anything will shave me as close as a single blade.  Sadly it&#x27;s more cost effective to buy double sided blades, than it is to keep replacing entire razors.  Granted, a quality safety razor is a lifelong investment, and considerably more expensive up-front than a disposable razor, but with a little TLC you can hand it down for generations, and the blades can be bought in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as far as the Schick Hydro 5 goes, here&#x27;s my breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness 4/5 whiskers&lt;br /&gt;Comfort 5/5 whiskers&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics 4/5 whiskers&lt;br /&gt;Value 1/5 whiskers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL 3/5 whiskers  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this razor to anyone who uses disposables.  Hands down one of the better ones, in my opinion.So, as far as the Schick Hydro 5 goes, here&#x27;s my breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness 4/5 whiskers&lt;br /&gt;Comfort 5/5 whiskers&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics 4/5 whiskers&lt;br /&gt;Value 1/5 whiskers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL 3/5 whiskers  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this razor to anyone who uses disposables.

    <li> Got a free sample of this razor, and was really impressed. It is as good a regular razor with 5 blades and a swivel head... and it gave a close cut even though I only shave every 5 days or so. Much less expensive than buying refill cartridges. It has all the features of a more expensive razor... it is a little light weight so you have to change your grip a little, but this is to be expected.  I see no reason to purchase more expensive refill cartridges.  Yes, this was free, but I will be buying more as soon as I use these up. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I recently tried out Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razors. The package was easy to open &amp; I would say by the appearance of the razor that these are a unisex type of razor. My wife &amp; I both used them and both really liked them. The textured grip handle is very comfortable for both of us. The blades are smooth &amp; gentle on the skin covering all necessary angles. There is a nice smooth glide strip that works well and helps to avoid abrasions and cuts. Hair is released easily when the the razor is placed under running water or submerged in the sink or tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very comfortable recommending these razors for both men &amp; women.</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent, I received a free pack of Schick Hydro 5 disposables and I found that they shave as well as, or better than any refillable I&#x27;ve ever used! They give an extremely close shave, even along the jaw-line. So close, in fact, that I don&#x27;t feel stubble all day. With my sensitive face and slow-grow beard, I only need to shave every three days or so, but the water-activated gel keeps my sensitive face happy. The head is bigger than I&#x27;m used to, which can make it harder to shave in tight spots, like under the nose, but I&#x27;m adapting!</li>
    <li> Wow I got this razor from a promotion from schick and I would say it is the best razor I have used and the hydrating gel works the whole razors life.  I would use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Clean shave. Can shave without cream if needed. Leaves skin moisturized. Shave head is a little large for under the nose shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would shave again.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor ever. It gives a close shave with no irritation. This razor last a long time. I have very coarse facial hair and it is no match for this razor.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this shaver! I am african american and have very sensitive skin I shaved in all directions and I could not get this thing to knick me once.  The aloe and vitamin E gel is a nice added touch. It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth, so you&#x27;re getting a shave and a facial. Very well built, it definitely exceeded my expectations so much so that you hate to throw it away. Luckily you get 3 in a pack.</li>
    <li> I get a better shave with one blade.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly impressed by these razors. The lubrication strip makes shaving smooth and easy and leaves my face incredibly soft once I&#x27;m finished. With these razors I must say that I almost look forward to shaving. The grip is perfect and I can easily access all areas of my body. Cut is clean... Very well developed product. I will be using them for a long time to come. Disclosure: I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I recently received a free sample pack of this product to test out.  I have rather sensitive skin on my face, and I often get irritation from disposable razor blades, so I&#x27;m usually hesitant about using them.  However, that was not the case with this disposable razor.  I used this razor on three weeks worth of facial hair growth.  I splashed my face with warm water before starting, and lathered on a thin amount of shaving gel.  As soon as a starting shaving with the razor, I noted that it smoothly glided over my skin.  The 5 blades easily cut through my hair, and there was no tangling or pulling sensation when I was shaving. The hydrating gel reservoir seemed to help minimize skin irritation.  The handle was easy to grip, and it allowed for good control of the razor during the entirety of the shaving experience.  Overall, the razor left me with a smooth, clean shaven face with little to no irritation during or after the shave.  I was pleased with the quality of this product, especially for a disposable razor.  Ultimately, I would recommend this product to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. All views are my own.</li>
    <li> I received a free pack of razors from Schick to test. Here&#x27;s what I thought:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Glides over skin, leaves a clean shave, good quality blades.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Difficult to cut a straight line for sideburns, couldn&#x27;t get to the prickles underneath my nose (needed to use a 3-blade razor for that).</li>
    <li> I tried these razors as a BzzAgent , they are really nice, such a nice , clean , smooth gliding razor with five blades.  If you like a razor that doesnt hurt your face , TRY THESE.</li>
    <li> Great razor, blades lasted much longer than the average disposable blades. Gave a nice close shave with no skin irritation. I received this razor free from Bzzagent to sample and give my honest opinion, which this 100% is.</li>
    <li> These razors are fantastic, especially for disposables. They provide a smooth shave and work really well for multiple shaves. The only problem I had with the razor is that the way the blade cover goes on is a bit weird. I actually sliced the tip of my finger putting it on. I&#x27;ll be fair and say that at least 50% was user error, but there may be a safer way to apply the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a sample to review from BzzAgent. I was not required to give a positive review.</li>
    <li> I got these razors as a free sample, and put them to the test. They have a clean shave and I didn&#x27;t get any nicks or cuts.</li>
    <li> For disposables, these are about the best you can get.  Smooth, close shave, after a week I have no irritation (and I usually do with disposables)...the Hydro strip works really well for me.  They also feel substantial in your hand...which I appreciate more than flimsy disposables...more like a cartridge feel.  I shave in the shower and rarely use shaving gel (usually just a bit of glycerin soap lather) and this system seems to work great with these Hydro 5&#x27;s.  Full disclosure, I received a free razor from Schick as a trial.</li>
    <li> I got these razors for free from the manufacturer. These razors stay sharp for a long time and feel good in the hand. The only major downfall is that if you don&#x27;t have a coupon they are pricey.</li>
    <li> Very good razor.  The closest, smoothest shave I have ever had.  They are very pricey but the razors last longer than the cheep store brand.  Gel reservoir really helps the razor glide effortlessly while shaving but it feels a little slimy.  Overall I would recommend these razors.</li>
    <li> These razors work pretty well. I didn&#x27;t feel any irritation. It gave me a close shave as well. The blades didn&#x27;t get clogged too much. The razor got the job done without too many strokes.</li>
    <li> Finding a good reliable disposable shaver can sometimes be hard to find. You have a lot of expectations since its cleaning and grooming something near and dear to you. Schick hydro met all my expectations! Its gives you a clean smooth shave without leaving any stubble or razor bumps. I leave a light beard on my face, so I needed something that can shape it and keep it tidy, this definitely does the job. An overall good shaver</li>
    <li> I received a 3-pack as a promo from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used disposables before. I&#x27;ve been using a Fusion for the bulk my shaving, and touching up the goatee and &#x27;stache with a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is awesome. The &amp;#34;hydro&amp;#34; coats your face with a layer of lubricant that&#x27;s kind of slimey but works great. I&#x27;ve never had such a smooth shave. I made sure to follow my normal routine using the same gel and everything, and this is by far the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had. Even if I didn&#x27;t shower prior to shaving, it&#x27;s smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 3 shaves were extra smooth due to the hydro strip. However, the fourth shave wasn&#x27;t quite as slick. My skin was still very smooth though, it just wasn&#x27;t quite as enjoyable to shave. I&#x27;m thinking I can get 4-5 good shaves out of a single razor, and maybe a few more decent shaves after that. I&#x27;m new to disposables, but that seems decent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do like that there&#x27;s a cover for the blades. Even though my kid can&#x27;t get to it and even if she did she wouldn&#x27;t do too much damage, it&#x27;s nice that there&#x27;s a replaceable cover on the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you should note that this doesn&#x27;t have that single blade for tight spots on the opposite end that some other blades do. This may be a deal breaker for some, but I couldn&#x27;t care less. My old razor had the single blade on the opposite end of the head, but I&#x27;ve always thought they sucked. I just use my shavette (the ones the barber uses that you brake a blade in half)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a nice razor. I&#x27;m not sure about the average longevity of a disposable, but 5 shaves or so seems decent to me.</li>
    <li> I received a free 3 pack of &amp;#34;Schick Hydro 5&amp;#34; disposable razors from BzzAgent.com about 2 months ago. Here is what I think of it.&lt;br /&gt;Close shave? When shaving around my beard I can go 2 days without it showing. My skin does feel smooth and I think it does better than my usual double blade.&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating Gel Reservoir-It&#x27;s made with aloe, Vit E and oils-Is it a gimmick or does it work? My skin feels smooth. No irritation. So, I think it may work. However, it is water activated and sometimes there seems to be a little stickiness or very thin liquidy string over part of the blades at times. I just wipe it away. I like the idea of it though.&lt;br /&gt;Flip Trimmer-made for tight areas and edges-you flip the gel reservoir to expose the blades-Great for above and below my beard. I was able to to get as close as I wanted to get the straight edge. I can be accurate with this than my other razor. However, I did have trouble flipping it every time.&lt;br /&gt;The handle-Larger than I&#x27;m used to, which is good. It is ergonomic, and has a gel feel to it. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it. Whether I&#x27;ll pay for a 5-blade razor to shave around my beard is another story. If I do shave completely, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;My father-in-law also tried it. He likes the larger handle because of his arthritis. He said it&#x27;s easier for him to use. He also agrees that it gives him a closer shave than his usual razor.</li>
    <li> So I really hate having facial hair. Its just an annoyance and always makes my face feel uncomfortable and itchy. That&#x27;s where the Schick razor comes in! I tend to shave every single day because I just can&#x27;t stand to have even the smallest bit of hair on my face but with the Schick razor, it shaveso closely that I only have to shave every other day which is so much easier!</li>
    <li> The Schick hydro 5 Razor is a light weight disposable razor with 5 blades and fits nicely in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;The schick hydro 5 disposables razors are awesome. I&#x27;m going to be honest I always used another brands 3-blade razor for my shaving needs. it was a little bit expensive but being a creature of habit I just kept getting the same razor until I got to try the schick hydro 5 disposable. The Hydro 5 gives you a very close and smooth shave for a disposable razor. i would even say it&#x27;s a better shave then my old razors. I have sensitive skin and shaving can be awful sometimes with the skin rash and ingrown hairs bumps. but the 3 weeks that I used the schick hydro 5 my skin cleared up and had less bumps. for a disposable razor the schick hydro 5 is worth every penny in value. they are half the price of my regular razors and hold up just as long. I for one will be switching to the schick hydro 5 right after all my old razors are used up.</li>
    <li> I received a three pack of these razors for a trial normally I do not buy disposable razors these seem to be pretty decent quality they give you a very close shave comfortable grip and seem like they&#x27;re going to last for a while</li>
    <li> These are great shavers and give a great close shave. I have coarse hair and these shaved those hairs off well. The fact that i didnt need shaving cream to get the desired results is a plus. Highly reccommend.I received these shavers as a promotion from the brand on bzzagent.com and im greatful to have been chosen to try out such a great product. No regrets here.</li>
    <li> I got these from bzzagent.com and they do what they are intended for,  but I plan on sticking with my electric trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single blade on the back is eh,  but I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars for the fact that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and does give you a smooth shave</li>
    <li> I got a pack of these free as a promotional offer and was skeptical. More blades usually doesn&#x27;t make a better razor, but these things are awesome! I don &#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t advertise that the top strip flips back in order to be able to trim up really close. That&#x27;s usually the worst thing about the big four and five blade razors. Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because of the price. I&#x27;d rater have 3 or 4 blades if it would make it cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have the non-disposal version of this razor ( in which you just buy new heads.) The heads on the disposal version are identical to the heads sold for the version in which you retain the handle. So the only difference is the handle on the disposables is much lighter. The cut though is the same as is how long the blades last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use an electric 4-5 days per week and a blade the other 2-3. The Hydro 5 is one of the best blades I have ever used. With 5 blades it cuts smoothly, has an excellent glide over the face, and I cannot recall ever cutting myself even when pressed for time and shaving a little fast. I can get a couple months (at 2-3 shaves per week) out of a single blade with no loss of cutting quality. In addition the hyrdo 5 blade design is such that it cleans under the facuet better than any blade I have tried. It both cleans completely but also quickly. That may not sound like much, but it contributes greatly to how well this cuts and how quickly you can complete your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a flip down ability, where the lubrication bar on top of the razor will flip out of the way. I actually use it as it helps get under the nose and also get the sideburn area straighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a premium razor but at the same time has a performance that is also premium.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor, 3 Count (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;I received the Schick HYDRO 5 Disposable Jeatables they are awesome, I can say it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve used, the hydrating gel and the skin guards reduces friction for that smooth perfect shave, it has Aloe, shave oils with vitamin E that gives you a smooth glide while shaving that prevents irritation,m I could barely feel the shave and got an amazing smooth shave. The top white piece flips back so you can get the perfect outline, I highly reccomend these and will continue to buy them, my partner even took one and used it on the entire body and got a beautiful smooth shave , this is the best disposable razor for my skin, thanks BzzAgent for letting me these as I will continue to use them, their great</li>
    <li> This razor gives you a smooth shave every time.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin like others do.  Design is great and glides smoothly on the face.</li>
    <li> Great razors, I even got my wife to try them for her legs instead of her &amp;#34;female-oriented&amp;#34; razors. I highly recommend you giving these a try before buying another expensive refill.</li>
    <li> Very high quality razor. I recommend the Schick Hydro 5 for any shaving needs.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use disposable razors, but received these through a bzz feed promotion.  They worked better than I thought they would.  I thought the gel was a gimmick, but it really did leave my face feeling soothed.  It gave a close shave, and my face felt great.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the head was too wobbly, although that may be just personal preference.</li>
    <li> My skin is really sensitive, so anything like this always makes me hesitate.  I love this razor and it is awesome for a free sample from BzzAgent.  I got to review it and give my opinion.  One of the best that I have used and I hate shaving!  This makes it nice and smooth without tearing up my face.</li>
    <li> I received these from bzzagent for free in the mail! I gave them a try and I they are the best disposable razors I have ever tried. My face feels so smooth! And I didn&#x27;t even cut myself!</li>
    <li> The blades do a good job of providing a close shave but the head is so large because it houses all 5 blades. This large head makes it harder to shave the upper lip and to get a precision shave if you are trying to trim around a beard or side burns.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as a promotion from the brand and I must say. These razors are very smooth and has a really close and clean shave and I&#x27;d recommend them to any of my guy friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of the Schick brand for years. I was hesitant to try a disposable razor, but I received a pack of these from bzzagent.com to review.  My honest opinion of these disposables  is a positive one.  They provide a great close shave, no razor burn and no ingrown hairs. I highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Amazing Razors they beat all expectations!! I received these razors as part of pormotion from the company but after trying them I can say there is no going back !!</li>
    <li> This razor is legit!  I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for about 21 years.  Head hairs are probably more concentrated than any others on your body (hairs per square inch), so it&#x27;s important to use a quality razor.  With most razors, I have to make 3-4 passes to get the smooth shave I like...not with this one!  This one got everything on the first pass!  One of the other big issues is hot spots.  My head gets pretty irritated with most razors.  The hydrating feature of this one allowed the razor to glide effortlessly and I had no irritation whatsoever.  Great razor!!!  ***I received these razors are part of a BzzAgent promotion.***</li>
    <li> I received the razors as part of a promotion from schick, the blades are spaced wider than the competition and do not clog, the blades feel sharper but the best feature is the hydrating gel. It eliminates the need for additional shave cream when doing a second or third pass on your face.</li>
    <li> These razors are fabulous. I don&#x27;t shave myself, but I gave them to my girlfriend. She loved them! Here&#x27;s what she said, &amp;#34;those razors are sort of life changing. My legs are so smooth!&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I received a pack of these razors from bzzagent.com and I will be making a permanent switch. very comfortable and close shave.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and close of a shave I received from this razor.  And it&#x27;s disposable?  wow.</li>
    <li> Good razor, I got a little razor burn but over all a good product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually shave, but the Schick Hydro 5 didn&#x27;t cut me and it got a close shave. My wife loved it so much she stole a razor and used it on her legs! My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit light, but that&#x27;s to be expected from a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> For disposable razor this is a great quality product,they way it was made and how it fills on your hands.It has 5 razors and moving head which is very convenient when you shave.In my opinion this is a very good quality razor and I would buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s truly incredible how far disposable razors have come since the last time I used one!  The Shick Hydro 5 Disposables are better than my normal everyday razor!  It just glides across your face and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s shaving you!  After you are done your face is smooth and lubricated!  It is TRULY awesome!!!  Thanks Shick!</li>
    <li> These are gentle razors that glide easily over any angles of skin. I&#x27;ve used them on all of my shaveable body parts with no cuts or abrasions. The razor head flips around to follow skin contours. There is a nice strip of something gooey (Aloe?) that helps things glide along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say these are pretty much a unisex type of razor. I can&#x27;t identify anything about these that would bar the use of any gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself releases the cut hairs cleanly when submerged in a basin, or held under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip handle is large enough to hold comfortably for both my small hands and looks good for larger hands. The grip is textured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get three entire razor bodies for the price, and the package is super easy to open - you don&#x27;t need to get out the box cutters for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, this is a nicely thought through set of what seem to be luxury disposable razors, at a very friendly price point. Well-recommended for men or women.</li>
    <li> I am submitting this review to let you know that so far out of the many razors I been using, this Schick disposables hydro performs and feels the best during and after shaving.</li>
    <li> Best value for the buck razor that I have used till date!</li>
    <li> These are some awesome razors for the price. They deliver a closer shave than my regular razor. Schick has a new customer.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I&#x27;m usually the cheapskate that buys the lower priced razors that usually only have 3 blades. They don&#x27;t cost me much and I don&#x27;t feel bad throwing them out after a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have bought the razors that you can buy the new blades for and just swap out the heads on them. Those are nice but the refills are crazy expensive. Well these Schick Hydro 5 Disposables combine the quality of the refillable razors with the lower cost and convenience of plain old disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only one complaint in the design of them however. The blade cover that you remove to use the razor is removed by pulling upward. I hate that. I feel like with one slip of a finger off of the cap, I will slice  it on the blades. I prefer the ones with caps that you pull down away from the the blades. I have cut myself in the past, so I know it&#x27;s possible. So for my remedy I just leave the cap off and call it good!</li>
    <li> Definitely one of the best razors out there. Definitely recommend for a nice clean smooth shave</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy disposables, because my experience with them has not been especially positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving these razors free as a promo and trying them and seeing how close a shave they gave me,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use these on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gave me one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had in quite awhile.</li>
    <li> They work as well as the regular razor. Something to keep in mind when you forget to bring one on the road and need disposables. You usually see disposables as the \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; version, but this one definitely debunks that myth. I got these Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor, 3 Count from BzzAgent as a product sample and wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor has been a good razor for shaving my stubble away to a nice smooth chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Disposable 2-pack that doesn&#x27;t require the use of extra soap/shave cream due to on-razor moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Flip back trimming protector for shaping&lt;br /&gt;Minimal Razor Burn&lt;br /&gt;Minimal nicks/cuts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Snot-like texture left over from moisturizer (Hydro)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this a few times, the Schick Hydro has been giving me a very clean and smooth shave with a very clean and moisturized feeling.  The wide head, which is due to the 5 blades) helps create a broad base for the shave to prevent from settling in any crevices causing unwanted nicks or cuts.  This is something I ran into when I used my Schick Quattro and I must say I&#x27;m impressed/pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor complaint I have is that the hydro aspect, while it does leave a nice moisturized feeling on the face, it also leaves a snot like residue on the face and it is not easily rinsed off.  I had to pretty much scrub my face with my hands and towel.  I want this to wash off cleanly, like a soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d buy it for sure, and would most likely buy the non-disposable version to help keep the landfills emptier.  I did receive this free through a BzzAgent campaign but that had to influence on my review.</li>
    <li> I recieved these as a free promotion through bzzagent.  I have extremely sensitive skin and usually have to be careful with the types of razors I use on my skin. I liked that these have a flip down trimmer. I thought they gave a close comfortable shave with minimal irritation.  I felt that they had a little too much of the gel in the gel reservoir. It actually felt a little slimy and made it feel slippery.  But really that was my only complaint.  These are a good value and I feel like you get what you pay for with these.</li>
    <li> Got a free set from Schick and quickly went out and bought more. They are very smooth and dont gunk up when rinsed. The handles are great and the best I&#x27;ve seen on a disposable. I&#x27;d recommend these over your standard disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Pros: Very close shave&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: leaves goopy mess on face from moisturizer strip&lt;br /&gt;No single blade detail trimmer function&lt;br /&gt;Head is large and somewhat bulky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this razor to a friend or make the switch myself, however I was very impressed with the closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> Over the past several years I’ve gone between the electric shaver, the Gillette Mach3, the Schick Quattro and the Gillette Fusion.  I’ve liked the Gillette Fusion (for the most part) so I haven’t deviated from it recently.  So when I was given the opportunity to try the Schick Hydro 5 through a free sample program, I was a bit hesitant (as I didn’t really like the Quattro).  However, after now using this for almost 2 weeks I can say I really, really like this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I got a nice, smooth shave and the razor fit the contours of my face well.  The handle was heavy enough to feel sturdy, which I like.  In addition, the design of this blade makes for a much easier clean-up than other blades I’ve tried in the past.  I didn’t really notice much of a difference from their gel reservoir, so I can’t rate that as a positive or a negative thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was pleasantly surprised as I didn’t really expect to notice much of a difference…but I did.  I definitely would recommend trying this blade out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. On a side note, my wife also tried this out as she typically likes men’s razors over women’s razors for her legs.  She agreed that she thought this was a good, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I recently received these as a trial from bzzagent and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed I always thought the multiple blades were a expensive gimmick till I started to use them that got squashed quick truely a great shave and I don&#x27;t use shaving cream either no nicks or triple passes needed my wife has even stole them from me and she loves them as well great buy going forward</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a promotion and I was very satisfied with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;Protection sleeve&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication strip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Lacks Pivoting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;Good razor worth the money and I would purchase this razor again.</li>
    <li> I finally found a razor that doesn&#x27;t tug my hairs while I&#x27;m shaving! Extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are the most amazing razors ever! I have very sensitive skin and never quite got the shave I&#x27;ve wanted without damaging my skin. Decided to try these razors and wasn&#x27;t let down. I mainly use it on my body but also to clean up my beard and I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using these razors.</li>
    <li> I am usually a Gillette guy but recently had the opportunity to try out the Schick Hydro 5 disposable razors and I&#x27;m ready to make the switch. Not only does the razor give you an incredibly close shave, it keeps your face hydrated with every stroke. My Gillette razor couldn&#x27;t do that. Sign me up #TeamSchick</li>
    <li> Pretty good razors, just expensive. Only $1 less per razor than for the fancy vibrating swivel head razor cartridges. Got these free from BzzAgent, though, so it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Schick Hyrdro 5 scored a 5 in my book! I shave almost everyday and use a lot of disposable razors. Schick is not new to me but their new Hydro 5 razors are and they gave me one of the closest shaves ever from a disposable. The aloe and other oils they provide gave me a close shave that did not leave my face dry. I really like the &amp;#34;flip trimmer&amp;#34; built into the razor. This was perfect for sidburns and shaving on the upper lip area just under my nose. I think I have found my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; disposable razor!</li>
    <li> SCHICK HYDRO® 5 DISPOSABLES&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat I have to say it is the best razor I have used in years.&lt;br /&gt;It provided me with a clean and smooth shave.Leaving my skin nice and shinning.Looking very professional.&lt;br /&gt;The SCHICK HYDRO® 5 DISPOSABLES with 5 extra thin razors that provide a  close clean shave,that reduces friction between the skin and the outcome is less irritation and removing all hairs from the root.&lt;br /&gt;It also uses hydrating gel with aloe and shave oils to add the finishing touch to that perfect shave everyone is looking for</li>
    <li> These are amazing razors. They are a very close shave and i am very pleased with them. Will definitely make these my razor of choice in the future</li>
    <li> I recently had a opportunity to test this product.Sometimes i get tired of unjamming my other razor from multiple uses and this is when these come in handy. Defiantly perfect for a on the go person. The non slip rubber grip design is awesome. Also the package is easy to open so you don&#x27;t have to struggle to get a razor when you need a new one.</li>
    <li> I received this from bzzagent to try out. I think it is a great razor. It does a good job and is very smooth feeling. I think they are well worth the price. I do not know about the longevity. I am excited to find out.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick hydro 5 disposable Reazor as part of a promotion of the brand, that is the reason why I changed my Gillette Sensor 3 to tray oder brand.&lt;br /&gt;After the first time I used the Hydro 5 I decided to CHANGE my old brand. First of all because is so much more confortable than the others razors that I tried. The second reason is because the HYDRATING GEL REALLY WORKS, you can feel and see the difference during the shave, when you finish (seriously I never felt my skin so smooth and hydrated after shave). The third reason why I recommend this razor is it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re shaving beacuse it glides right over your skin (When I was shaving I asked myself &amp;#34;Is this thing working?&amp;#34;, because I couldn&#x27;t feel the razor against my skin, but when I finished and washed my face I noted the perfection of the work of Hydro 5).&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore the things I mentioned I can also say this disposable razor is very comfortable to grip and it is very light.</li>
    <li> I got these for free to try them out and was pleasantly surprised at how well they work. I am not a big fan of disposable razors, so I was skeptical, but they work as well as my electric shaver, but don&#x27;t cost as much!</li>
    <li> very nice shave for even others as myself shave their head. The trim blade ,however, works well around beard trim areas. BZZAGENT let me try it free and i am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Just tried these Schick Hydro 5 disposables, and it was a smooth shave. They have hydrating gel built into the face of the razor, which has aloe in it. Was interesting to have the gel on my face while shaving, but it came off with a rinse. The gel also flips back so you can trim sideburns, ect without the gel. Really nice disposable, good for shower shaving or taking on trips in your overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the five blades as I got a nice close shave without the razor burn.  I usually use a four blade Gillette along with shaving cream, this was just as good and I didn&#x27;t use the cream because of the hydrating gel built into the face of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these free as a BuzzAgent #GotItFree</li>
    <li> It is a very light razor which deliver a close and smooth shave because of the five blades and the hydrating gel. I noticed that they stay sharp after several uses. The only thing I did not like is that because the size of the head is hard to reach some areas, but other than that it&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
    <li> Schick hydro 5 disposable razors are some of the best disposable razors I have tried . They give you a smooth comfortable shave that you wouldn&#x27;t expect from a disposable.  I strongly recommend these razors over any other disposables.</li>
    <li> I actually received a free Hydro 5 from Shick to try out and after putting this razor through its paces here are my initial thoughts: It&#x27;s a great razor if you are packing light for a trip or don&#x27;t want to bring a bunch of crap with you to the gym. Is the performance great? Absolutely. Am I going to make this my main go-to razor? Probably not. The features don&#x27;t have enough value to make me give up my simple 4-blade cartridge razor just yet. I&#x27;m definitely stashing one or two in my duffel bag, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades do a great job of taking the stubble down, but I really don&#x27;t get the point of having 5. It just makes the head of the razor larger and to a certain extent, more difficult to maneuver. They last a good amount of time and the quality is very good. Compared to their 4-blade razors though, I really don&#x27;t see much of an advantage other than the fact that the lubricant kajigger works better. And speaking of...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the point of the lubricator? Unless you don&#x27;t already use a shaving cream/lubricant, I really can&#x27;t understand how this feature aids during a shave other than to make my face feel more gooey. 9 of the 10 times I put a razor to my face, I&#x27;ve already laid down a layer of Dr. Carver&#x27;s Shave Butter. So unless I&#x27;m a rush and short on shaving cream, this isn&#x27;t really helping my shave at all. Side note: Dr. Carver&#x27;s Shave Butter is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used to grease up my beardy business before a hedge trimming. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those two gripes aside, it&#x27;s a solid product and I must agree with several other reviewers here that it cleans out far more easily than most razors I&#x27;ve handled. That&#x27;s most certainly a feature I can appreciate as a person who goes from zero to lumberjack-level stubble in less than a day&#x27;s time. So yes, keep one in your gym bag and save some time and space during your shave. I&#x27;d make a Dr. Who joke here, but Cybermen don&#x27;t have beards.</li>
    <li> This has been one of the best razor&#x27;s i have ever used. It is certainly better than any disposable razor i have ever used, and it is on par if not better than some of the cartridge razors out there currently in the market. Having received a sample of this product, I can honestly say it is great!. I have recently used gillete&#x27;s new fusion proglide, and the Schick Hydro 5 disposable razors were significantly better than gillete. The shave is smooth, no cuts and does not leave your skin irritated. It glides through your face. You do not feel as though it is pulling your hairs at all. Just a great razor!</li>
    <li> this is one of the best disposables on the market.great shave.extremely sharp</li>
    <li> I have tried several disposable razors in the past and these shave better than any (I prefer not list the competitor&#x27;s name). Here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Smooth shave (I typically can&#x27;t shave everyday, due to sensitive skin, but am able to with these)&lt;br /&gt;* Comfortable grip; they feel like a standard razor, not a disposable one&lt;br /&gt;* I really like the travel guard, no worries about reaching in your travel bag to be cut by exposed blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* So far I&#x27;ve used (1) razor three times and still have a smooth shave</li>
    <li> Just tried this razor over the weekend and loved the closeness of the shave.  I have very sensitive skin and have a hard time getting a smooth shave without razor burn.  Not an issue here.  It was a smooth shave with no irritation.  The flip back was also a nice feature that allows for me to get a close shave in those hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> I was surprisingly impressed with the schick hydro 5 disposable razers; which going into the campain I had not previously used any schick razer products. The gel did a good job at making the skin nice and soft and did not allow for any friction or any razorburn. The blades were very sharp and gave a nice close, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Great razors. I have always used the single blade disposable razor because of cost. But the improvement of my shave is worth the addictional cost. Recommend it to anyone that will ask</li>
    <li> I usually shave every other day. I have a fair amount of facial hair so I was looking for something that gave me a clean shave as well as handled precision shaving and trimming well. In terms of quality, this razor is the best that I&#x27;ve ever used. It gave me an very clean shave. I did not experience any razor burn or bumps. I appreciated the hydration element as it left my skin feeling smooth and clean. I do wish that that trimming aspect worked better. It was still a little too clunky to do the shaping that I need for it to do. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who is doing any regular full face shaving.</li>
    <li> After years of almost constant razor burn, I no longer have it with these razors! After receiving these in the mail through BzzAgent, i really put them to work! In addition to myself using theses, my girlfriend also found that these worked wonders for her sensitive skin on her legs! I really feel these razors, even though they are disposable, are great for the price point. Definitely worth it and i know I will purchase again in the future, I would recommend these to any friend!</li>
    <li> Close shave and easy to use. Blades glide over the skin instead of pulling it. I received these fro Bzz agent as a sample to try and feel in love with the razor</li>
    <li> I shave a couple times a week and was looking forward to trying out a razor that hydrates your skin. Switching from a 3 blade 5 blade razor setup, I was wondering if this would speed up the shaving process? The short answer is yes, but here is the review. The packaged arrive and wasn&#x27;t too difficult to open. I first noticed the case covering the razor. It wasn&#x27;t loose like other disposable razor I have used, which is nice. I keep a disposable razor in my toiletries case when traveling and having a case that completely encases the blades and stays on is nice. Anyway, I tried it out in the shower. I don&#x27;t use shaving cream and just shave while taking a shower. The razor did a great job. I didn&#x27;t find myself going over the same spot several times. It was only about three passes and all the facial hair in that section was gone. The hydrating part was a nice touch at the end. No razor burns and a smooth shave. Felt completely safe using it and didn&#x27;t worry about \\&quot;cutting myself.\\&quot; My wife even comment on how smooth my face/jaw was, which was an added bonus. Only difficult thing may be washing out the hair in the blades. Took a few seconds longer then a three blade I have used previously. Great over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I did receive this product as part of a promotion to evaluate and rate.</li>
    <li> I received it as part of a promotion from the brand. A very nice razor. The lubricating gel seems to last for about 7 shaves and I get no burns and cuts till atleast 10 shaves.</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR ISN&#x27;T A BAD RAZOR! I LIKED THE SHARPNESS OF THE BLADES I FIND MYSELF GETTING CUT WITH A FRESH RAZOR BECAUSE ITS SO SHARP. IT DID GIVE ME RAZOR BURN BUT GOOD CLEAN SHAVE.</li>
    <li> I tried these razors and didn&#x27;t like them. They just aren&#x27;t as smooth as my current razor. The smooth close feel after shaving just isn&#x27;t there. Maybe it&#x27;s the water I am using . I will not be buying these again. No value in not feeling refreshed after a shave.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I prefer safety razors  to cartridge models. I did two or three shaves with this and found th&lt;br /&gt;at I got a similar shave to my safety razor, and in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My partner is a daily shaver and prefers the cartridge multi blade  razors. He has achieved a very close shave and Is still using this disposable a month later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;close shave&lt;br /&gt;longevity&lt;br /&gt;No irritations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Tugs at beard&lt;br /&gt;does not shave mustache area very well (pulls on skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: this skeptic was impressed With the great shave this provides.</li>
    <li> Last summer I purchased these disposable razors for my husband.  HE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THEM (incredible as he has high standards....especially regarding disposable razors)!  Schick&#x27;s female 5 blade is great too!</li>
    <li> I received a package of Shick Hydro 5 disposable razors as part of a promotion from the manufactuerer a few weeks ago and tried them out a few days ago.  I typically use a multi-blade replaceable cartridge razor with good results (little irritation, close shave, etc.).  Compared to my usual razor, I found the Shick disposables to be somewhat lacking.  Overall, the blades did not seem to be sharp enough.  This led to going over sensitive areas like my lower neck multiple times to cut the difficult hairs, leading to irritation.  It seems like Shick added the gel reservoirs to these razors to combat this problem.  Unfortunately, the razors dispense too much gel, or perhaps the gel is too viscous - either way it leads to a very gloppy, unpleasant feeling.  On the plus side, the razors are inexpensive and have a comfortable handle.  I would use these razors in a pinch, but wouldn&#x27;t seek them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tl;dr:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;-Good handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not sharp enough&lt;br /&gt;- Gloppy gel reservoir&lt;br /&gt;-Flip-up trimmer gets in the way</li>
    <li> I was able to try these razors free through BzzAgent, and they really surprised me. I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of razors that contain lubricants in the shave head, because they&#x27;ve never seemed to work (I&#x27;m thinking specifically of my Gillette Fusion). However, the hydrating gel on the Schick Hydro 5 was awesome. I could actually see and feel the gel on my skin, which made for an amazingly smooth shave. I was able to shave probably 20 percent faster because the shave was so comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even got brave and tried using the razor with out any shaving cream (stupid, I know). But to my surprise, the hydrating gel provided enough lubrication, and I didn&#x27;t end up with a single nick or any razor burn. Wow. I really hope the lubrication strip lasts for a while. I will definitely keep these in my travel bag, and maybe I won&#x27;t have to pack shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best features:&lt;br /&gt;- Hydrating gel made the shave comfortable and quick&lt;br /&gt;- Flip and trim feature made it really easy to trim my sideburns&lt;br /&gt;- Five blades meant I didn&#x27;t have to go over as many spots repeatedly</li>
    <li> I have been using Schick for several years, both the Quatro and Hydro 5 but have never tried disposables of any kind. I always pictured the rigid, cheap feeling Bic razors in the plastic bag - but these couldnt be more different! I got a two pack of these free from Schick to try, and when I held it up next to my Hydro 5 and was surprised that the head was completely identical. After I used this it made me realize it was time for a new head actually - it was super sharp, and between that and the moisturizing strip I saved time by not needing to trim before my shave or moisturize after. I would definitely look for this again if I need a disposable!</li>
    <li> This razor does glide over your face and is very close. I am a daily razor shaver so I need something that will last and this razor does. The gel reservoir lasts seems like forever. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have not used a disposable razor in quite sometime.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with this one.  I thought it gave a nice smooth shave and the lubricating strip was really nice.  I am also surprised at how long the blade lasts.  Normally a blade lasts me three to four times.  i&#x27;m already on my third use and i&#x27;m pretty certain i&#x27;ll have a few more uses to go.  This was actually my biggest shock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shave goes, I think it&#x27;s great.  The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because it&#x27;s very bulky around tight spots, especially under my nose.  It does have a feature, where you can pull down the lubricating strip to keep it less bulky, but I didn&#x27;t find that very helpful.  It is helpful for trimming side burns though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would def consider buying these again.  they would be great as a back up or on vacation when I don&#x27;t want to lose my non-disposable razor!</li>
    <li> I have never been much of a manual shaver, I always used my electric shaver.. of course the electric shaver never got the skin is smooth as shaving with a razor. After using these razors for about a week, I now consider myself to be a daily shaver with razors. I was skeptical of these razors because every company claims they get the closest and smoothest shave. Out of all of the other razors I have ever tried, these by far hold the title of the smoothest and closest shave. The blades keep their sharpness after repeated shaves which means more bang for my buck. I recommend these razors to any guy for home or travel use alike. Until Schick comes out with a better razor, these will be in my arsenal at my man cave..</li>
    <li> Great for use while traveling. I substituted this instead of bringing my electronic shaver on a recent trip.</li>
    <li> this is a great product to use if you don&#x27;t have an electric shaver or as a travel mate. the smooth cut on your face and nice and even smooth strokes make it a great product to you, better then some of that cheap stuff, that can leave you all cut up and feeling rough.</li>
    <li> I was giving this product as something to try by BzzAgent. It was really interesting and it left my face feeling pretty smooth. And it really help cut the hair short to where I don&#x27;t have to shave as much. This is really a great product!</li>
    <li> Very close shave that allows for comfort and eases.  It takes no time at all and there is no tugging or pulling.</li>
    <li> Received my&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received my Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor from Bzz Agent to try. While I am not a regular user of disposable razors, I willingly gave this one a try. To my surprise, I loved it. It gave me a smooth, clean shave without irritation. The only issues that I had was that the razor itself was more lightweight than I am used to. I use a refillable razor regularly and feel that I am used to having a more heavy weighted handle. For the price, though, this razor is worth it. Very affordable.</li>
    <li> Got to give these razors a try (thanks to bzzagent.com) and I must say I wasn&#x27;t disappointed I love the way they made my skin feel nice and smooth after shaving I would diffidently recommend getting these razors you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro 5 disposable razors work very well. My first shave with the Shick Hydro 5 disposable razor was so much easier than my old razor.  It went straight into the trash and the Schick Hydro 5 disposable took its place.  Thanks to Buzzagent for sending me a sample to try!&lt;br /&gt;Schick Hydro 5 disposable razors amazingly make shaving easier than ever.  The hydrating gel reservoir&#x27;s water-activated gel, with a great mix of aloe, Vitamin E, and shave oils, hydrates your skin throughout each shave. The 5 Ultra Glide® Blades with Skin Guards reduce friction and control skin flow so you get a smooth shave.The flip trimmer is the perfect tool for edges and other tight spaces and easy to use.  The disposable handle is ergonomic and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro 5 is a good disposable razor that will leave your skin feel smooth and cuts close to your skin. This is one of the best disposable razors I have tried. The razor may cost a little more than generic brands of disposable razors but it is well worth the few cents to get a quality product and a quality shave. I have used this product for a few weeks and notice a similar result compared to my Gillette Mach 3 razor.  Got mine free from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> They live up to all the advertisements.  I never tried a 5 blade razor before, and like the cut of my face and the feel of the handle.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moSK32MY6VF0XY]]The price is reasonable ($3 per blade) and the quality is superb. You can use each razor many times. Well done.</li>
    <li> The first use with the disposable Shick hydro 5 was pretty painful. I use a very expensive pre shave balm and there was still quite w bit of drag and pulling from these blades. I gave it another couple tries and it did get better, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Bzz Agent (www.BzzAgent.com) and I get coupons and samples to try products and give my unbiased opinion. I am doing the Schick Hydro 5 disposable razor Bzz campaign now. It does an OK job shaving, though I do have noticeable razor burn on my neck. It has a pretty sturdy handle but the springy part attached to the razor seems super flimsy. Not really important. It leaves straight lines behind under the shaving cream so I&#x27;m not sure if it has 100% coverage over the razor area strangely enough. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s probably better than most disposables I&#x27;ve used but I&#x27;d rather use a better quality non-disposable.</li>
    <li> I recevied this razor free with a bzzkit and have been using it for about a week now.  I get a really close shave without irritation or razor burn.  I have used the same razor about three times and do see a difference after 3 shaves.  I like the extra trimmer that you can use for getting around edges and trimming.  The gel in the razor keeps the shave smooth and moist, and the 5 blades gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> I received a pack of these razors through a promotion by Schick. The razors are well built for disposables and they yield an effortless shave. The Flip Trimmer feature is a brilliant idea that makes trimming sideburns and shaving close to the lips easier than ever. Why then do I only give two stars? Unfortunately for me, I have coarse facial hair and the extremely close shave left me with a plethora of ingrown hairs the next day. I wanted to be fair and even stuck it out for a week, but this only made the problem worse. I really wanted this razor to work out for me, but due to my facial hair it wasn&#x27;t in the cards.</li>
    <li> I received a pack of these razors as part of a promotions and they are great! It was really great. No more red and irritated skin, also is very comfortable to handle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that I have very sensitive skin.  After years trying manual razors (mostly Gillettes and double edge safety razors) and never finding one that didn&#x27;t eat my skin, I switched to electrics and haven&#x27;t ever considered  going back.  When I did use manual razors, I never liked Schicks, so I was reluctant to try this one.  After several uses, I thought this razor was so-so. While it was comfortable to use and glided over my skin, it didn&#x27;t get that close.  Also, the shaves caused minor irritation on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious if my wife might like the razor, so she got one to try.  She had used the Gillette Venus, but now she&#x27;ll only use the Schick Hydro 5 disposable.  She said it&#x27;s the closest and most comfortable shave she&#x27;s ever had.  Plus she hasn&#x27;t gotten a single cut.  She also likes the razor&#x27;s light weight, and that the blades last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I won&#x27;t get any more of these, but my wife can be counted on to use these exclusively.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as a promotional item from Bzzagent to try and share my thoughts. First id like to say I cant remember the last time I used a disposable razor to shave my face. I usually buy cartridges style razor from a big name company. When I first got these razors I was shocked at the quality of the razor from feel to looks. Has five blades with a conditioning pad on the head and the handle had a nice feel to it, well balanced. I was excited to try a new razor since it had been a long time trying a different razor. This razor worked just as well if not better than my other previous razor. For the price of these id would definitely us again in the future.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Schick and BuzzAgt, I was able to try these razors for free. When I first took them out of the package, my first thought was how big it is. I mean, the handle, the blade cover, the overall design just seemed so large for a razor. But considering it has 5 blades, I guess this is really to be expected. The first time I used it, however, I was completely in awe of how close of a shave I got with this razor. Definitely an awesome razor that  performs well.</li>
    <li> I came across my first Hydro 5 when I purchased a pack of [[ASIN:B0056GOHN4 Schick Quattro Titanium Disposable Razors for Men]] that included one of these as a sample. I can make a direct comparison to the Quattro, as well as to wet shaving with a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the hydrating gel reservoir does not act as a shaving cream or gel - you still need one or the other. It is a feature that is designed to keep your face protected when you go over the same place a few times after the initial stroke that removes the cream or gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor, like the Quattro, needs a few strokes to break in when you first use it. Mine pulled a little on the first few strokes with the grain, but quickly smoothed out. I think this is a quirk with Schick blades in general because I have never experienced it with a Mach 3 or even a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you generally use shaving cream note that this (and the Quattro) work a lot better with a gel type cream than foam. If you are a wet shaver who occasionally uses disposables for convenience I need to point out that these do not work well at all with shaving soap and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These take a strong stream of water to clean, which is the only complaint I have. Otherwise this model has proven to be the best disposable, multi-blade razor that I have tried because it is absolutely smooth (after a fast break in) and leaves my sensitive face closely shaved with no rash or other issues.</li>
    <li> This razor has been one of the best shower razor&#x27;s i&#x27;ve used.  I don&#x27;t shave outside the shower and everytime i get a good close shave. My wife has also used it on her legs and wants me to get her a set!</li>
    <li> These are great. I switched back from a double edge safety razor, and the difference in convenience is huge. I don&#x27;t have to worry about the perfect technique, and the hydrating strips on these really do make a big difference.</li>
    <li> Good shave at a reasonable price. I received these as a promotion for Schick, but will probably continue buying these when I need a travel razor. Disposable so you get a fresh handle when you toss the blade. The &#x27;hydro&#x27; gel pad gives a nice lubrication so you can shave without any shaving cream in a pinch. Doesn&#x27;t cut like many other razors. My only complaint is that the head is a bit large, so it is a bit difficult to shave my upper lip by my nose.</li>
    <li> Travelling?  Need a quick shave?  Forgot to shave before work and had a big meeting?  All of these can be answered with using these razors as opposed to higher priced, blade refills.  With these, you can save money and have the most comfortable shave that a disposable razor can possibly give you!  I got to try them free through bzzagent, and already picked up another pack of them for future use!  #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I received a free one of these from BzzAgent, and I was pleasantly surprised!  I&#x27;m not a fan of disposables, but this is great razor.  So much better than most disposables.  Sharp blade and a clean, close shave.</li>
    <li> I tried the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor as a BzzAgent.  The razors I received for free as part of a marketing campaign to try out a product and then in return offer a fair and unbiased feedback on the product.  First of all, I like the razors.  I felt they gave me a nice clean shave without having to go over the same areas over and over again.  Being disposable the razor is very lightweight, but definitely gets the job done.  One of my favorite parts about the razor was the hydrating gel reservoir which left my skin feeling smooth, but not stripped down.  The campaign begin in January, and it&#x27;s been cold.  And if you&#x27;ve been shaving for a while you know how that frigid cold wind can make a clean shaven face feel.  My face really felt much more comfortable heading out after my morning shave, in part because of the added protection from the hydrating gel.  Finally, the most frustrating part of all multi-blade razors is the clogging up with hair if you don&#x27;t keep the stubble to a minimum.  I did not experience and clogging after going multiple days between shaves.  (For those that are wondering I would say the hair on my face grows at a medium rate so there was quite a bit of growth to clean up.)  Is this a razor that you should run out and buy right away if you&#x27;re happy with your current shave, no.  However, if you&#x27;re thinking there&#x27;s got to be something better than what your currently using this is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product via BzzAgent and have been using the razor for about 2 weeks. The addition of blades always makes me think of that SNL skit where there are 20 blades, &#x27;for an even CLOSER shave!&#x27; and the guy has nicks all over himself. Do we need 5 blades? I don&#x27;t know but I did enjoy the shave this disposable gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this disposable certainly exceeds my expectations in terms of comfort and quality of shave. I keep a large beard and still trim/shave my neck area with razors or my trimmer. Using just warm water, I did my neck in less than a minute without issue. After a few goes, I now feel comfortable shaving quickly without worry of cutting myself up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the disposable on my chest after giving myself a bald spot trimming my chest hair. I thought &#x27;hey, why not, let&#x27;s do the chest&#x27; in the shower and I have to say the razor leaves a smooth and close shave. Finally, for those who occasionally shave everything, I can from experience say that you&#x27;ll have no issues using simply hot water in the shower to shave your scrotum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I received a couple of these in a product promotion and I normally just use my beard and hair trimmer for all my needs. However, I am satisfied with the performance: closeness and quality of the shave that I&#x27;ve been getting from these disposables. I probably won&#x27;t buy these regularly as I use a trimmer but I certainly will continue to use the ones I&#x27;ve acquired until they become dull.</li>
    <li> I received these razors via a bzzagent campaign and was skeptical for a few reasons.  First and foremost I&#x27;ve always had a bad experience with disposables.  They shave is rough, I get irritation as a result and they have always felt like a one and done kind of shave.  Second, I&#x27;ve always used Gillette razors and I&#x27;m not even sure why.  Brand visibility maybe?  Either way I was certainly curious when theses were shipped to my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insert the hydro 5.  I open the first razor, apply my shave gel.  I use an organic peppermint gel.  Dr. Bonners I believe is the brand.  Let it sit a bit and begin to shave.  I was immediately impressed with how easy the razor removed my facial hair.  One clean pass with a quick touch up and I was done with each section.  The razor wasn&#x27;t pulling at my skin (I left a hearty 5&#x27;oclock) and my skin felt good.  The gel Schick uses on the razor head is also very nice.  You can visibly see if lathering your skin.  I was pretty impressed at this point.  I cleaned my razor with a quick rinse and went on with my day.  I have now shaved 5 times with the first disposable and I&#x27;m confident I can continue to shave with that first razor at least a couple more times before it dulls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick has converted me with this razor and my opinion on disposable razors has completely changed.  I won&#x27;t be going back to Gillette and will continue to use these surprising little razors.  Great product!</li>
    <li> These are great travel razors to back you if you forget to pack your reusable.  The blades don&#x27;t scrape your skin.  I have rough facial hair and regularly grow a beard and these can get me back to smooth pretty easily and are able to keep on working for about 3 weeks.  I got a few to sample from an online program.  I don&#x27;t normally review items like personal care products, but this stood up to my stubble.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro is hands down the best razor I have used it is by far superior to others I have used in the past. Initially I thought the Hydro blade casing might be a little too bulky but that didn&#x27;t turn out to be the case. It&#x27;s a good looking razor it works really well and best of all the replacement blades are cheaper than my usual brand</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;BzzAgent&amp;#34; for many years. That means I get samples of products to try and test, then I get to tell other people about these products (good or bad!) This most recent campaign was for Schick Hydro 5 disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that although they provide an overall close shave, edge trimming (shaping my beard) is difficult with them.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this disposable is much better than the ProGlide that I had previously bought. The gel above the blades was much better at keeping my skin wet and lubricated. I felt like they stayed sharper, longer too. Liked this pack.</li>
    <li> Love these shavors. Schick Hydro 5 shavers were amazing.  My skin is very sensitive And I had no break out at all, I can shave up to two weeks on one shaver. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s rear. Amazing!</li>
    <li> i recieved this as a promotion from the company itself. this is an amazing razor. it had lots of great things within it such as a flip trimmer and aloe and vitamin e and 5 blades to give a close, smooth shave. very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> These are surprisingly great little razors that I got to try at no charge as part of a survey.  Lightweight, comfortable, and gave a very close shave.  I switch back and forth between manual razors and electric, so it was great to see that I could get such a comfortable and fast shave from these new disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I received these Schick Hydro disposables as a part of a testing package, and I must say nothing but amazing shaves with these. 3 blades lasted me no joke 3 WEEKS! I was able to salvage two to three shaves from each razor, in all fairness I am not the hairiest guy nor do I grow the shaggiest beard but I do get a lot of stubble and enough hair to change my look. Being able to purchase disposables that are sturdy gripped and last for a couple shaves is wonderful, these are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> They are decent razors. I usually use regular razors. However, these kept cutting me. I don&#x27;t know why because with other razors I never get cut. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy these myself. They are built great and last quite a few shaves. The hair grew back faster than normal, though. My fianc&amp;eacute; used one on her legs and she wasn&#x27;t a fan. She had the same problem where her hair grew back really fast. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s a very close shave.</li>
    <li> good confident disposable razor&#x27; lightweight,after the second shave i started too get a really nice close shave.i got to try&#x27;em for free BzzAgent.com im an BzzAgent-</li>
    <li> This is an average razor.  I don&#x27;t think it shaves quite as close as disposable Bic razors and the cap on this razor is more difficult to remove/replace.</li>
    <li> Great razor considering they are disposable. Has a lubricant that helps with a smoother shave and reduce razor bumps. Nice clean shave and can get more than one shave out of them depending on hair thickness and abuse.</li>
    <li> I got the shick hydro 5 to review for bzz agent.  I shave both my face and head daily so I gave this thing a good workout.  I think that 5 blades is a gimmick, and I have found no improvement when companies keep adding blades.  However, what is not a gimmick is the moisturizer bar.  You can really feel the lotion on your skin and it really helps prevent razor burn and, especially when using the blade without shaving cream or soap.  The lotion lasts a long time too.  For me, the blade dulled before the lotion ran out.  Overall it is a great blade, just stop trying to trick us into thinking more blades equals better.</li>
    <li> I am part of a BUZZAGENT campaign, and I have received a pack of Schick to try and review. These are my impression: 3 Blades or 5 Blades? The same.... 5 Blades shaves great the first two times and then the same as a 3 blades. So no extra value in that. The strip, it is GREAT works well i did not used the aftershave and I have sensitive skin, The only problem is that it last 4 - 5 cuts.... SO if the price of the blades is low enough, i presume they are worth to buy otherwise no.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, I received a pack of these razors for free from Schick to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smoothness: I shave once a week so there&#x27;s typically some pretty thick hair for my manual razor to mow through. I&#x27;ve used a Gillette ProGlide practically as long as I&#x27;ve shaved but this razor inspired me to branch out. The biggest difference was how smooth the shave was with the Hydro5. Typically there&#x27;s some decent tug and pull I get with my ProGlide but I immediately noticed that the Hydro5 just slid right through it! What a wonderful feeling!&lt;br /&gt;-Flip back gel reservoir: The flip back gel reservoir also solved the problem of getting those hairs right up under my nose. Instead of a single blade on the flip side, I was able to use the advantage of all of the blades on my upper lip, another welcome luxury. The gel also lubricates and hydrates my skin exactly as advertised, leaving it nice and moisturized and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-Gel: As a couple people have already noted, one of the only complaints I have about this razor is how stringy the gel is. As soon as I remove the razor from my skin, the gel strings right off from my skin to the razor until I move it with my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;A great razor, smooth shave, leaving my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. I&#x27;m not above moving a few strings of gel out of the way and the benefits definitely outweigh the risk.</li>
    <li> I received the disposable version of this razor. I travel frequently, so I am constantly trying to find a disposable razor or an electric razor that has a close shave and smooth on the skin. I have extremely sensitive skin and the hydration feature of this razor that includes aloe and vitamin e is a huge benefit. Anyways, I am a member of Buzz Agent and I was offered to try out this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I typically use an electric shaver because it’s more convenient and takes less effort. The Hydro 5 Disposable razor completely changed my mind. The ability to go out and buy it a Walgreens or WalMart is a huge benefit and for my traveling life, accessibility is essential. This is one of the best disposable blades I have ever used; the 5-blade technology cuts smoothly and glides over the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the durability and build quality of this razor is exceptional and I would recommend buying. To re-iterate the hydration feature really works and contributes greatly to shaving process.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically use disposables, but these are some of the best if you&#x27;re going to use one.  I rec&#x27;d these for free as a part of trial in return for a review, but I&#x27;d already used them prior and they are still great.  I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I got these for free in a BzzAgent campaign and I am disappointed with the quality of the product and of the shave. I have used the entire pack and what I have noticed from my experience is they don&#x27;t give a consistent close shave to the entire face and they have a tough time edging areas with the large plastic exterior around the blades. They also have a tough time shaving the mustache area and particularity under the nose due to the design. After each shave, and I did give them a chance over the course of the past month, I can notice some areas are smooth and some areas are rough to the touch. These are issues I did not have using my old brand of razor which I will go back to once my trial razors expire. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product and I got it for free.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that this is Heather&#x27;s husband, and I was sent these to test and review as a BzzAgent, just so there will be no confusion.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I have extremely sensitive skin on my neck and upper lip, and shaving with a razor, safety or manual, isn&#x27;t something that I normally do. I received the razors and had a week&#x27;s worth of growth, so I started there. Let me say in summation, as you don&#x27;t need a blow-by-blow account of the event, that I was beyond excited about the results. The blades are sharp, as they should be, and they sliced right through a pretty tough beard. Also, the lubricating strips are wonderful. They kept my skin nice and supple the whole time, keeping it from drying out and creating ingrown hairs. It made quick work of my beard, and I tried the razor again with only one day&#x27;s growth, the amount that would usually leave my face a red mess, and it worked like a champ. The combo of the multiple blades and the lubricating strip are wonderful. I would highly recommend these razors to absolutely anyone!</li>
    <li> These are easily the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve ever used. Most I&#x27;ve tried have been like the BIC version, which are barely good for one shave. Surprisingly, these offered a week&#x27;s worth of comfortable shaves from each razor, which makes them handy when traveling on vacation or business. A very nice surprise!</li>
    <li> Great shave with these!</li>
    <li> Too bulky. A close shave on the wide parts of your face, but problematic trying to get under the nose and bottom lip. Not bad if you plan on growing a goatee and mustache, but otherwise, 5 blades is overkill.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I received these as a brand product review sample. That being said, if I hadn&#x27;t, and knew then what I do now, I&#x27;d pass these by on the shelf and look for something else. Nice concept, poor execution.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Will be switching from my old brand.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried just about every razor on the market. This one by far is the gentlest on my face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but this razor is fun to use and works so well.  It easily gets in and out of the hard-to-get spots. I really like the razor.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product.</li>
    <li> After having used 3-blade disposable shavers for years, I decided to see if the 5-blade units were any better.  I don&#x27;t shave very often, so the expense of a handle/cartridge set isn&#x27;t really worth it for me.  The last 3-blade disposable I used was [[ASIN:B001JQLNGY Gillette Sensor3 Smooth Shave Disposable Razor 8 Count]] and they were OK, but didn&#x27;t give the closest shave - I&#x27;d have to go over the same area several times to get a truly smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to pit the two 5-blade disposables against each other... the [[ASIN:B00AGEW0AI Gillette Fusion Men&#x27;s Disposable Razors 2 Count]] and these Schick Hydro 5 Disposables which come in a 3-pack.  My neighbor had given the Schick a strong thumbs-up after he tried it last year, saying it was the best shave he&#x27;s ever had with a blade razor.  Once I received both from Amazon, I gave them a side-by-side test... literally.  Shaved one side of my face with the Gillette, the other with the Schick.  I&#x27;ve used [[ASIN:B000052YIE Sensitive Skin Shave Gel Edge For Men 7 Ounce Soothing Aloe Preventing Nicks Cuts Irritation]] for 20 years, so that was the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; of choice for the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both razors did a better job than the 3-blade Sensor3, with very little need for additional passes over the same area.  But while both did the job, the Schick felt better in the hand, and was a little bit smoother.  Not really enough to make a firm decision one way or another, so I then had to go with value.  Schick gives you a 3-pack for the price of Gillette&#x27;s 2-pack and that swayed the pendulum.  I&#x27;ll finish off the two Gillette Fusion razors, then I&#x27;ll use the Schick Hydro 5s and buy a few more packs for the bathroom cabinet.  Obviously the type and length of facial hair you have will make a big difference, but I like the 5-blade shave better than the 3, I like the Schick a little better than the Gillette, and I like the Schick&#x27;s price a lot better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product saves money</li>
    <li> This razor was a major let down. I began shaving with about 2mm of hair on my face. This razor pulled at the hair instead of cutting and took several passes to successfully cut the hair. It nicked my face in several places (I dont normally nick myself when shaving), and immediately after shaving I look like I have a 5 O&#x27; Clock shadow and can fell the stubble left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - plenty of hydration and moisture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a close shave&lt;br /&gt;Pulls hair&lt;br /&gt;Cuts skin much too easily</li>
    <li> I got a free trial of these and at first I was discouraged by the feel of the handle they seemed cheap but that was not the case. I found the to be just as efficient as my normal cartridge razor. The moisture strip provided a nice smooth shave even after most of my shaving cream was gone. I ended up with a nice smooth face and it passed my wife&#x27;s test as well.</li>
    <li> Just used them for the 1st time. It was a really great shave, close and clean. The head seems a little big, but to my amazement it worked great. They are very lightweight, and durable. I would recommend to everyone. I got the chance to try this prodcut from bzzagent.com</li>
    <li> Smooth comfortable shave. No razor burn and I especially like the flip trimmer for perfectly straight sideburns and beard lines. Definitely would buy again!</li>
    <li> I just got this razor for the first time and when I used it I was impressed with its quality. I have been using razors for many years. I have used some of the worst disposables out there, but this is not one of them. This razor was a quality one. The grip is amazing. I love how it handles even when it is wet. The blades are nearly identical to the reusable handle refills. I would take this with me on a trip and not worry about losing or forgetting it because it only costs about $2-$3 a razor and if you have a coupon it will even be less.</li>
    <li> This has been one of the best razor&#x27;s i have ever used. It is certainly better than any disposable razor i have ever used, and it is on par if not better than some of the cartridge razors out there currently in the market. Having received a sample of this product, I can honestly say it is great!. I have recently used gillete&#x27;s new fusion proglide, and the Schick Hydro 5 disposable razors were significantly better than gillete. The shave is smooth, no cuts and does not leave your skin irritated. It glides through your face. You do not feel as though it is pulling your hairs at all. Just a great razor!</li>
    <li> The title says it all. I am a Hydro refillable user and wanted to give this a try. I received a sample of this product and it was all that and more. It has every function the refillable has, yet lighter and more cost effective. The shave was clean and close, just what you would expect from a Schick Hydro product but this handle is lighter which gives you more control. I still get the 5 blades, the gel lubrication, and the flip top guard, but now with a lighter handle and more control. This is something I will definitely be stocking up on!</li>
    <li> While having more blades in a razor seems like a good idea in actuality not so much. If your head was melon shaped with no jawline, upper lip or dimples a big wide razor would probably work very well, but we&#x27;re not built that way. Here&#x27;s what didn&#x27;t work for me: Upper lip, could never remove all whiskers directly under nose, razor is to wide. Small cleft in chin. Never was a clean shave, razor is to wide. Jaw, razor took multiple passes to cleanly shave jaw line. I usually use a two blade Bic disposable or a Panasonic electric and get better results. Also don&#x27;t go to many days without shaving when using this razor there&#x27;s five blades pulling at your beard and it&#x27;s not comfortable. FYI I do not have a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> Me:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the type of man that even though I could shave every day I don&#x27;t; due to time and my skin gets irritated; therefore I shave every three to four days.I got the product as part of a promotion from Schick and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;What would I want to know before I get this product?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to know if the shave is in fact very smooth and is pleasant to shave, it is worth the time to try the product and the money if I want to decide to use it as my main razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product:&lt;br /&gt;It comes a package of three razors, color blue which is appealing for a guy, plastic the main material and very comfortable to use for either a right or left handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal Experience:&lt;br /&gt;I tried after I didn&#x27;t shave for eight days to check if even with a lot of hair on my face the product is good as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Is in fact very smooth and very soft and I could say it felt very comfortable, no scratch,no cuts which is good. I felt no friction and at the end of shaving I noticed that there was no irritation on my skin which is a big plus in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The head of the razor is too big;therefore is very difficult to shave in the area between the upper lip and the nose due to the fact that the razor has five blades which make the \\&quot;head\\&quot; of the razor larger than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product for those persons like my that the skin gets very easily irritated; the price is reasonable since you are getting three razors that could last more than a month or two depending of the usage you give to the product. The product met my expectations on the disposables.</li>
    <li> The 5 blades make for a pretty fast shaving experience and the gel strip is pretty nice too.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro 5 Disposable gives me a very close shave with no irritation.  Prior to trying the disposable razor I used the regular Schick Hydro 5 for the past year or 2 and have had good results during that time.  I feel that I get a longer use out of the 5 blade razor than I did with prior 3 blade razors that I have used.  I probably change blades every 3-4 weeks.  After several weeks the shave it not quite as smooth but still produces a good shave.  The one down side that I have found with the disposable vs the regular cartridge handle version of this razor is that the disposable is very lite so it feels very different when you use it if you are used to a heavier cartridge razor.  The grip on the disposable is not as good as the grip on the cartridge razor either.  After you apply shaving cream with your hand the handle feels a little slick in your hand compared to what I&#x27;m used to.  Overall a very good shave and a blade that lasts for a long time.  I received the disposable razors as a free sample from Bzzagent.</li>
    <li> These Razors Rock, never knew  what a smooth close cut I could achieve  before the Schick hydro,&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree  Because I&#x27;m a BzzAgent.....</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this razor for the first time. I received my razor and opened it right away. This was great because I got to receive this razor as part of a review from Schick. This was a great free razor to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did was hold it in my hand. I felt like it was well-balanced and the handle felt really comfortable. I played around with the head of the razor and examined the five blades. They looked really well done. I also looked at the flip back trimmer. Not too impressed with that. I just did not seem to leave much room to trim. I also liked that it had hydrating lotion in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it came time to shave. I have not shaved since September and this was the end of January that I was trying out this razor, so I trimmed with an electric trimmer first.  Once I got it far enough down, I lathered up and started the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to empty the blades a lot during my shave. I also had to take my thumb and clean out the blades several times. The hydration seemed to have gone away after the first few times of rinsing. I attempted to use the trimmer part to trim my sideburns, and it did not seem to do anything for me. After using this blade I had several razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the concept is good of five blades and the hydration was good as well, I am only giving this razor 3 stars because there is a lot of room for improvement, especially when comparing to my Mach 3. This razor just does not cut it.</li>
    <li> I really liked the razor but didn&#x27;t find it to be that much better than the other Schick Disposable razor that I currently use.  It was comfortable and easy to use.  It gave me a smooth shave and moisturized at the same time, but it is more expensive than the Schick Disposable razor I&#x27;m currently using.</li>
    <li> Tried the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor and was pleasantly surprised. Packaging was clean and easy to open. Blades were sharp and provided a smooth shave all the way around. I normally use Gillette Fusion blades and was really surprised at how much gap is being closed by the disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawback:&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to reach areas are difficult with this razor&lt;br /&gt;-Light handle makes you press harder to glide the razor, which could increase possibility of cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I am a Bzz Agent and was provided some for review at no cost. The only bad part is that they are disposable. The really cool feature is that you can flip the &amp;#34;lotion strip&amp;#34; part out of the way so you can get right under your nostrils. It may be a small difference but it is what has turned me off from the multi blade high tech razors in the past. Definitely worth checking out, especially for travel. If you are at home use something that doesn&#x27;t fill up landfills and put plastic into the environment</li>
    <li> I received this pack of amazing razors from BzzAgent. I have shaved with these razors now for about five shaves and I have to say they are amazing. After every shave they leave my face feeling hydrated and smoosme. The flip down top for tight spaces works really well. I will definitely be buying these again! Thank you BzzAgent!</li>
    <li> Received these Schick Hydro 5 razors thanks to #Bzzagent. My face hasn&#x27;t felt this awesome after a shave in a long time. The process was smooth and clean with no irritation or pain. The flip trimmer was great for precision around my beard. My face was left feeling so soft (baby bottom soft). Recommended to anyone looking for quality.</li>
    <li> with 5 blades you have less strokes per shave so less skin irritation you will shave faster but it dulls the same as a 2 blade dollar store razor I would rather buy the dollar store razors &amp; save money. I got the razor free from Schick to try it glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it</li>
    <li> These are superb disposables that leave you with a super close shave. Perfect for military or any man on the go! Price for these are also great! Got these free to sample and try. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> Got these from bzzagent the other day. Needed to shave cause I was feeling scruffy. So I pulled one out of the pack and went to the process of shaving. Thinking that these were going to be just like any other razor didn&#x27;t have any high hopes for it. Then once I started it felt amazing. it glided smoothy across my face. Could feel the lubricant going to work to keep everything running smooth. This has got to be one of the most comfortable shaves I have ever had. When I was done My face felt so smooth and so soft. It&#x27;s the closest shave that I have had in a while. I would highly recommend the Schick Hydro 5 to anyone tired or bored with the current shaver. trust me this shaver rocks. The lub strip flips up so that you don&#x27;t waste it and get it all over when your done.</li>
    <li> This razor worked almost effortlessly and left my skin feeling smoother than I thought a razor can do.  I am not much for brand loyalty or fall for the hype of multi-blade designs but truly, the Hydro series is a razor for the discriminating man and woman who shave regularly and sensitive to any irritation that comes from doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro for men (re-branded [[ASIN:B00AHF1GTM Hydro Silk for women]]) is the most recent razor redesigns that now feature five blades and heavily modified lubricating strip that stays wetter longer, producing an effortlessly close shave comparable to the [[ASIN:B00AGEW0AI Gillette Fusion]] (a alternate five blade design).  As a Mexican-American male with healthy skin, I grow large patches of stubble on cheeks with denser (thicker?) patches of hairs under my nose and chin - I shave regularly but not everyday.  I shave the same area four times as I go with and against the grain, with each time the Schick Hydro was able to cut through three or four days of stubble with the most distinctive ease, even on my chin area which is usually my indicator that it&#x27;s time to use a new razor. Truly, between the additional blade, extra lubrication strip, these razor guards that prevent skin from drawn too deeply in between blades, Schick has produce something that manages to stand out from the almost indistinguishable Men&#x27;s razor market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I cannot help but wonder if wonder if the design has hit an impasse.  On average, these razors last a little more three months and come to the conclusion is they they might be providing TOO close a shave.  After the applying the aftershave, I have felt the burn.  Well it might something that many men have resigned themselves to expect, the burn was different after the Schick Hydro - I felt it wherever I shaved and I cannot help to wonder that now these multi-blade designs are in fact shaving more skin as well.  Instead of having the distinct trimmer of the Fusion or [[ASIN:B0056GOHN4 Quattro]] designs, Schick engineers went for a flip-top design that moves the lubricating strip (the blue strip) away from the razor head and locks that in place - it takes two hands to do it, which may not be that that simple if they are large or wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, it is an awesome razor and leaves an incredibly smooth and effortless shave.  The transparent design - you can see through in-between blades - ensures that it rinses out well as it dries out, providing the same experience for weeks to come.  As much I like how these performed, I am going to stick to my Quattro series - between the titanium coated blades and the protective wires, it&#x27;s almost impossible to cut your self and last a little more than these.Quattro]] designs, Schick engineers went for a flip-top design that moves the lubricating strip (the blue strip) away from the razor head and locks that in place - it takes two hands to do it, which may not be that that simple if they are large or wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, it is an awesome razor and leaves an incredibly smooth and effortless shave.

    <li> For a disposable, this is probably one of the better ones. I primarily use rotary electrics to shave my face, but the Schick Hydro 5 will work in a pinch and it is great on my neck hair. It is similar to my wife&#x27;s multi-blade razor which I sometimes use. The 5 blades cut smoothly and cleanly, and the gel strip helps lubricate the razor. Just be sure to rinse thoroughly after each use and place it in a spot were it can dry thoroughly between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> I received these as a promotion through BzzAgent.  I really like these razors compared to other disposables I have used.  The downside I found with them were that the shave was not as close as when using a razor with cartridges.  I did like the hydrating gel, it left my skin feeling moisturized when using them.  But once again this ran out after a couple shaves, so I was reminded by this it was a disposable razor, and needed to be switched out.  The flip trimmer is a great feature that most disposables do not have.  It did a good job cleaning up the edge of my sideburns.  Overall these are a great disposable razor, but not sure if they would work for everyday use unless you throw it out every few days.</li>
    <li> These disposables work better than any other disposable I have ever used. Highly recommend d you try these out.</li>
    <li> Irritated skin after I used it and some bleeding but man it does give you one neck of a close shave for a disposable</li>
    <li> i got this free for review and been loving this razor , Great got travel no worries about leaving it behind , Very hard to believe that I get such an amazing shave from a disposable razor , so close and no cuts just clean shave</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Schick Hydro 5 disposable in a bzz kit. I have only used regular razors before sampling this disposable. This razor gave me several clean shaves from one razor and the hydrating gel is refreshing. I believe I will be making a switch to this product. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> In the 8 or so years that I have been shaving on a regular basis I have tried your non-disposables, disposables, electric razors, and so on. However, I never really found a razor that wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated and lead to acne. I have super sensitive skin when it comes to shaving and most disposables and electric razors only irritated my skin more, while non-disposables just continually got to expensive for a college student. So often I was stuck with cheap disposables that would lose their sharpness rather quickly. I shave about once to twice a week and enjoy a nice beard so having a razor that stays sharp after shaving longer hairs than just stubble is important. With the Schick Hydro 5, which I have used about five times, it still feels like the first shave. Its five blades insure that it stays sharper longer and the gel reservoir with aloe and vitamin E really help to prevent any irritation. While this isn&#x27;t a miracle razor that will last forever I have found it to be by far the best disposable razor I have used to date. With other razors like BIC left me going over areas 3 and 4 times to get the close shave I want, whereas with the Schick Hydro 5 a quick with the grain and the against the grain and you face feels as soft as a babies bottom. If you want a razor that will work with sensitive skin and last longer than a couple shaves Schick Hydro 5 should be at the top of your list.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro 5 disposables are great! I didn&#x27;t expect much from them. But the results are amazing. Thanks to Schick and Bzzagent I was able to try them for free. Schick Hydro 5 will definitely be my choice of razors from now on!</li>
    <li> I got a 3 pack in the mail as a person who does reviews on BzzAgent.com. The razor is great, I used it twice so far, once I used it with shaving gel and once without. Oddly enough my skin had more razor burn with the shaving gel, between the shaving gel and the aloe on the razor it seemed to leave a slimy coat. So the next time I decided to use the razor without the gel and just wet my face, it worked pretty good like that, my skin was very smooth and minimal razor burn.</li>
    <li> I saw these on sale at the store and was looking for someone with 4 or 5 blades for shaving. I&#x27;m very impressed with them, and will definitely be purchasing them again! They clean well, last longer than a few shaves, and they leave my skin feeling at least mostly hydrated (which is great, because shaving usually leaves my (very) sensitive skin feeling tight, dry, and uncomfortable. Finding a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like that is excellent. I think the razor is easy enough to maneuver and I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone, either gender.</li>
    <li> I recive this disposable razor as part of buzz agent campaing! I&#x27;m a full gillete fan. But this razor really surprise me. I have sensitive skin and work perfectly!!</li>
    <li> So to start this out, I have very (VERY) tough facial hair. Usually I cant shave with a typical disposable (even the fancier high end ones) for more than a week without the blades severely dulling and tearing up my face. That said, because of this, I also usually shave in the shower every other day, sometimes every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, here&#x27;s what I like about the razors:&lt;br /&gt;Longevity - each one lasted about two weeks before I could feel the blades becoming dull. This was almost double the more expensive replaceable head razors and definitely longer than my existing (gilette from costco) disposable pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glide - When in the shower the gel reservoir performed like a champ, although I did find it a bit overly gooey and stringy sometimes when I would pull the blade away from my face.  But in general the blades glided very smoothly and I could tell a big difference with this razor. Also, on the razors that were starting to wear after two weeks, there was still gell left on the head; which amazed me. Usually the gel last one or two shaves and its gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look/Packaging - Its okay. I think they are trying hard to sell the blue and orange factor, because in all honesty, these look more like a woman&#x27;s razor in both size and form factor.  I know because sometimes the women&#x27;s versions provided better shaves and I would buy those instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade count - Im not sure if it was a combo of extra blades, my current razor has three, but I rarely had to go over areas multiple times for that close shave. This was a refreshing change from my current razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, some things to improve for a 5 star:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Sink shaving&amp;#34; - I only shave in the shower, but in the interest of this review being thorough, I tried to shave in front of a sink. This is, in my opinion where the razor really struggled and fell apart. The razor was constantly going dry on my face mid-stroke, and I had to keep my face extremely wet to get it to work. This became a great chore. Wet face, shave, wet razor, wet face more, shave etc. It wasn&#x27;t a shining experience and the gel just wouldn&#x27;t stay wet (activated) long enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size - I HATE how large this thing is on my face. It makes shaving around the mouth and under the lower lip area very difficult. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have a small face etc, but the head is enormous. If they could somehow reduce the size of the head it would have gotten 5 stars from me, but I found I has to constantly fix/contort my face to shave the mouth corners area and lower lip/mid chin area. I also dislike the size of the handle - its not that slippery when its wet and it was also WAY too chunky.get it to work. This became a great chore.

    <li> I got a few free samples of these. The five blades give excellent performance. Feel very smooth while shaving. The close shave and lack of irritation to the skin are amazing. It is definitely the best disposable razor that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I received a free pack of razors from Schick to try out and couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the product. It was everything I would have wanted from a razor. Felt great and got a close shave!</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor free to try from BZZ Agent.  I have to say i was so impressed with how close of a shave it gave me.  I have been using an electric razor for years because I have such sensitive shin.  The Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor did not irritate my skin.  I did not have razor burn or any bumps.  Instead I was left with a smooth and soft ski The lubricating lotion made the razor glide along nice.</li>
    <li> Good razor that I got a sample from BzzAgent (great service!).  Lasted for a good number of shaves.  I&#x27;m not sure about having five blades, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an electric shaver by habit so these razors were a change for me. I definitely got a close shave and did not suffer the nicks I have gotten with other disposables in areas where you pivot (chin and jawline). Other disposables I have used have given me razor rash when switching from electric to disposable but these did not. As fars as disposables go, these last much longer than the ones I have used in the past, a pleasant surprise. Based on longevity, close shave and only very minor nicks (as a rookie user), I&#x27;d highly recommend the SCHICK HYDRO® 5 Disposables for daily and/or occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as part of a BzzAgent campaign.</li>
    <li> I love the five ultra glide blades with skin guards this reduces friction between the skin and the cartridge for a less irritating shave.&lt;br /&gt;The unique hydrating gel reservoir lasts up to 2 times longer than ordinary lubrication strips. Blade last about twice as long as others.&lt;br /&gt;It is the only disposable with a flip trimmer. You can engage the trimmer with your thumb and use on hard to reach areas for precise trimming.&lt;br /&gt;I just love getting a system technology in the convenience of a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> It was the first time I had used disposables for a number of years. However, I have been very pleased with the Hydro 5. I&#x27;ve gotten a smooth, close shave every time. The blade surface glides over the skin and does not irritate my skin at all. So far Ive been very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have often wondered if these 4+ blades razors are simply a gimmick to get people to buy them or not but never wanted to spend the extra few bucks to find out.  I mean a razor is a razor right?  So when I got a chance to test these 5 blade razors for free I was all over it.  The difference between the two blade razors I normally use and the Hydro 5 when shaving is ton less tugging on my face and less razor burn after use.  Also I found that these blades lasted longer to.  I am unsure if it because of the Schick brand itself or the extra blades either way I got more use out of these.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend them?  I would I just used up what I received to test and went out and bought more for my personal use.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was how sturdy this razor was in my hand. It won&#x27;t bend and tweek itself like some Bad News razors do. Five blades might be overkill and it makes the head a little larger than I&#x27;m used to. I have a beard and only shave above and below it and then only a couple of three times a week and the large head takes some getting used to. If I shaved my whole face and neck I&#x27;m sure this would be my razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually very impressed with these razors! The shave is excellent and extremely smooth. They are sharp and slide right across the face without even feeling it tug on the facial hair. I received these complimentary and I must say that I&#x27;m rethinking how I&#x27;ll buy razors in the future - looking at disposables vs the expensive refills.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro 5 is a great razor.  These razors work better than any of the refillables I have used recently and they are in another class compared to the disposables I&#x27;ve used.  No passing over the same spot again and again just see you still missed some hair.  The flip trimmer is great for getting tight spots and adding detail for a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> I received these razors from BzzAgents to use and then give my opinion on. To start, for a disposable theses are some great razors. I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful when choosing razors, I had no problems with these, I got a smooth, close shave with no breakouts at all. That was a big plus for me ! The gel strip is great it hydrated my skin and left my face feeling smooth. My wife loved that part, a lot of times after shaving she would say I was still prickly and my stubble poked her when we kissed. I didn&#x27;t have that problem with these razors. I was able to use each razor multiple times before it started pulling hairs instead of cutting them, so I felt they are well worth the money. I recommend these to anyone looking for a good disposable razor.</li>
    <li> I was able to try Schick HydroÂ® 5 Disposables free thanks to bzzagent! these razor have hydrating gel with shave oils and flip trimmer make this a unique shaving experience. I must admit they are the BEST diapoaible razors I have ever tried! ALL other disposible razors i havd used are only good for one use or sometimes not even that.  I was able to use the  Schick HydroÂ® 5 Disposables razor SEVERAL times and got a clean/ smooth shave each time unlike others  The shave is so clean and smooth, and  it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin whatsoever like the other disposable razors I previously used. You must try them and experience an amazing shave yourself!</li>
    <li> Best close shave for legs.  Women forget those &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; shavers, these companies cater to men, so they probably try to sell us their rejects.</li>
    <li> These razors aren&#x27;t quite as strong as the other Hydro 5 where you just replace the blade head, but they come close. They&#x27;re far from being anything like a Bic disposable. Good buy if the price is right.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using the Schick hydro 5 disposable razors  to shave my legs. The hydrating gel reservoir lasted through several shaves.  My legs didn&#x27;t feel as dry as they usually do with the razors I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> These are Excellent and I personally think these are better than the Schick in the green package...but they both are good but again these are a better feel on the skin.</li>
    <li> Over the years I’ve used many different razors, and I have to say this isn’t one of the better ones. It’s not bad and would work if it’s all I had available to me, but it doesn’t provide a close shave and I wasn’t a big fan of the hydrating gel.</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of these Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razors some time ago. It was the first time I had used disposables for a number of years, since my earlier experience with disposable razors was that they weren&#x27;t all that good to begin with and didn&#x27;t last very long. However, I have been very pleased with the Hydro 5. I&#x27;ve gotten a smooth, close shave every time. The blade surface glides over the skin and does not irritate my skin at all. Moreover, the blade stays sharp for several weeks of daily shaving. These are about as good as I&#x27;ve experienced to date.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moBDTYMSP1UTA1]]I didn&#x27;t like this razor at all. Every time I shaved my head with it, I had to get another razor to finish the job. The blades are too close together. This makes it really hard to shave a thick beard like mine. So, definitely pass on this if your beard or leg hairs have any thickness to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick usually makes great products, but I&#x27;m going back to my Schick 3 Extreme, until they engineer something better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Looks fancy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Only good for fine, wispy hair&lt;br /&gt;-Only good for flat surfaces&lt;br /&gt;-The blades are so close together that they don&#x27;t cut hair very well&lt;br /&gt;-Does a horrible job with corners and tight edges&lt;br /&gt;-The head is inflexible, so it doesn&#x27;t bend to your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought these disposable razors for my partner and he loves them. Light, ergonomic with a nice design, these razors do an efficient job (they have 3 blades) and leave an incredible soft skin thanks to aloe Vera. I wished Schick did an eco friendly version of these ones because if these razors are disposable,  they are unfortunately NOT recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;Try them and \\&quot;adopt\\&quot; them!</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s another razor.  Curiosity got the better of me and I had to try 5 blades.  Still waiting on the 10.  This one had the gel-glide bar or whatever they call it, but the blade rocks, I suppose to follow the contour of your face better, but I&#x27;d like a stationary one better.  Can&#x27;t really tell if the 5 blades are any better than my Schick Quattro I use now.  Not worth the extra $$$.  Every man is going to have a different opinion, but for me, one good try was enough.  Back to my 20 pack of Quattro from Sam&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> this is the first time I&#x27;ve used the Schick Hydro 5.  This razor is superior to the brand I&#x27;ve used for years but stopped due to&lt;br /&gt;its extreme cost increases.  I defy you to cut yourself with this Schick razor; it&#x27;s very smooth.  Additionally, it seems to stay sharp much longer than the&lt;br /&gt;previous brand I used.</li>
    <li> Razor manufacturers seem obsessed with adding more and more blades as well as other bells and whistles to their products. They would do better if they simply focused on making a high quality and long lasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five blades provides no benefit over two or three blades. In fact, five blades creates a large flat cutting area that makes the razor far less maneuverable than smaller razors. Using this razor I found it awkward to get into the little corners and sharp areas of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it&#x27;s well made, fairly long lasting and fits nicely in the hand. But that does not even begin to make up for the high cost and redundant blades.</li>
    <li> I really like these. They are my go to for disposable razors, I prefer changeable heads, but these are great. They are a close shave and have nice hydrating &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34; that activate on water. Close shave, so the summer shorts struggle is not there. :D</li>
    <li> I got this product to review from bzzagent. I have never used disposable razors until i received this package. I have sensitive skin so the hydrating gel is a huge help. I am pretty impressed of the closeness of the shave and how well these compare to regular razors. I will definitely be using these more. They are great to take with you if your traveling without having to take your regular razor along.</li>
    <li> this product, the schick hydro disposable razor is one of the best disposable razors ive ever used, I would have to rate it in my top three.  it shaved me closer than I ever expected, plus after I was finished, I put on my favorite after shave, which is brut, and was so suprized there was no burning sensation at all.  I was so very impressed with the schick hydro disposable razor, I just have to recommend that everyone give this product a try. I was always somewhat afraid of using a disposable with five blades, I usually cut easily, but the schick hydro disposable razor was so smooth, it just seemed to glide over my face, especially in the harder to shave places, like around my chin area, and on my neck. the area above the top lip has always been a problem area as well, but the schick hydro disposable razor just glided around and I ended up with a wonderful shave that was close and so very smooth. everyone that shaves should give the schick hydro disposable razor a try, get the shave you have been looking for, I know I did.</li>
    <li> I received this as a product review from BizzAgent. I love this new item. Works very well with my sensitive skin. I generally use an electric 4-5 days per week and a blade the other 2-3. The Hydro 5 is one of the best blades I have ever used. With 5 blades it cuts smoothly, has an excellent glide over the face, and I cannot recall ever cutting myself even when pressed for time and shaving a little fast. I can get a couple months (at 2-3 shaves per week) out of a single blade with no loss of cutting quality. In addition the hyrdo 5 blade design is such that it cleans under the facuet better than any blade I have tried. It both cleans completely but also quickly. That may not sound like much, but it contributes greatly to how well this cuts and how quickly you can complete your shave</li>
    <li> Great disposable razor! I don&#x27;t normally use them but travel for work and prefer not to bring my normal razor. They have a nice close shave and have a great feel to them unlike some other disposables I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I received the razors free as part of a promotion from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors are extremely easy to use and provide a very comfortable shave. I have some trouble areas on my face, which I regularly nick, but these handled it with ease. I would highly recommend these to anyone in search of a good disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is that the razor area does feel a bit large as compared to others I have used. The size makes getting used the control of the razor a bit more time consuming than others, but manageable once picked up.</li>
    <li> I have recently received this product for free,&lt;br /&gt;Everything from the bottom of the product to the top is a masterpiece, the way that the blades are positioned give it an effortless glide type shave, the infused gel replaced my shaving cream, and the overall feel of the razor is wonderful. This Razor has now become my FAVORITE RAZOR of all time, its simple and quick to use.</li>
    <li> First a disclaimer, I received these free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said this review is based on my objective experience.  I haven&#x27;t used a disposable razor in many years so may be a little behind on what is available today.  That being said I could easily switch back to disposables if this is what I could expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number of blades on these allow for a very close shave.  But there are several options in disposable razors with 5 blades so that likely isn&#x27;t really a difference maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the hydrating gel that seems to set these apart from others and I can say that these seem to live up to the advertising.  There was plenty of lubricant on these that allowed the blade to travel very comfortably across my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I found these to be comfortable and provided a nice close and clean shave.</li>
    <li> I have used some disposables in the past (usually in a pinch), and they have never provided the quality shave I prefer. I received these free to try out as a promotion from the brand. With this razor, I would say that the shave was comparable to my normal non disposable. Enough so that, I would prefer to take these while traveling for work. I generally only have to shave every other day or two. So far it seems that this razor gave a close enough shave that I can wait at least another day until I shave. My face felt good after the shave. The hydrating strip left it feeling moisturized. I do not feel or see razor burn. The ability to flip the hydrating strip out of the way for &amp;#34;close quarter&amp;#34; shaving is a nice feature. Made it easier to get the hairs right under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty light, but sturdy build. Comfortable to hold, and did not slip in my hand while shaving. The blades did &amp;#34;clog&amp;#34; up a bit, but that happens with all the multi-blade razors I have used. Easy enough to clean out with the faucet. I will be testing these out over my next few shaves, and if anything changes I will post an update.</li>
    <li> The razor is so painless and easy to use, that you won&#x27;t use any other. It took under 5 minutes to shave my face and my face never felt any better. I highly recommend this to anybody looking for a new razor to try out.</li>
    <li> One of the better disposables I&#x27;ve used.  If you have sensitive skin and still want a close shave without having to spend money on expensive razor heads, this is a good option.  I&#x27;m not one for disposables but these are very good.  Worth a try for sure.</li>
    <li> Best disposable I&#x27;ve tried yet and I&#x27;ve tried a decent amount from Gillette and Schick and Bic and there decent but these just cut through my beard and mustache with ease and no irritation and no stubbles left behind. I was pleased with these razors and thank you bzzagent for sending me a free pack to try out :) just so yall know I&#x27;m using my moms account for this review</li>
    <li> I received this as a bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to get to try something new for my morning shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first morning was excellent my face was as smooth as a babies but. Now the next morning was a completely different story. The shave was horrible, misses spots all over blades get clogged very easy. By the end if the day my face was on fire. The third day I had to go back to using my other brand razor and that blade was 3 weeks old and still did a better job</li>
    <li> The closest and more comfortable shave, ever! I tried the Schick Hydro 3 shaver for a long time and I constantly had to go over my face a few times. With the 5 blades it actually does make a difference. I just need to go over my face once with the Schick Hydro 5. The best thing about it is the cartridges are not too expensive either. But the razors themselves do last a while. I shave daily and it lasts about 1.5 weeks.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this razor at all. I got a pack free from bzzagent and before I made it out my first shave I finished with my fantastic cheapo single blades. This blade took to many swipes to remove hair, moisturizer was slimy and had no cooling or medicated feeling. The razor was big and clunky and hard to maneuver if you weren&#x27;t cutting all your facial hair off. I wouldn&#x27;t use again for free let alone buy these. I have curly facial hair so that may matter as well with my one star experience,  yours could be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Makes shaving easier and it&#x27;s great to know you have a brand new clean razor! Got this free to try through bzzagent. #freesample</li>
    <li> First thing I&#x27;d like to say is that I&#x27;ve exclusively been using disposable razors for about 20 years. This razor is a beast. If you have facial hair like i do i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It&#x27;s just to big. Unless you have the skill of trimming your facial hair with a battle axe then this isn&#x27;t the razor for you.  On the good side the blades hold their edge quite well and it does hydrate and moisturize Nicely.</li>
    <li> The other day I got a package of these in the mail for free to review (via BzzAgent). I normally don&#x27;t use disposables--we (human beings) already throw away way too much stuff--but I am impressed, nonetheless.  I am a old Quattro razor user and was skeptical about how one extra blade could make that much difference in the shave.  Well, it seems to actually make a difference!  The razor has a lubricating strip with &amp;#34;shaving oils&amp;#34; (I think it might be cocoa oil) which might also be a major factor.  Either way they gave me a much closer shave than my Quattro. The razors also ave a nicely designed handle, with a soft grip and more heft than a typical disposable but less heavy than a permanent razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am impressed enough that I am seriously considering changing over to the non-disposable version of this razor.  I won&#x27;t buy these tough, unless I am traveling and forgot my razor, because I am thoroughly anti-disposable razor on environmental principles.  Still, it is enough of an improvement to make me look at their non-disposable variety.  Looks like I will finally retire my old Quattro....Just not for a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using all the disposables I DID switch to the Hydro 5 normal razors.</li>
    <li> I was lucky to receive the campaign for the schick hydro5 razors. I am a bzz agent and courtesy of schick I got to try this product for free.&lt;br /&gt;At first look at the package you would think you are getting 5 razors in your package. But it really means you are getting 5 blades on your razor. You get 3 razors.&lt;br /&gt;Now I normally use the kind of razor that has the refill head not disposables. For a disposable razor over all I have to say it is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;I did have issues with the top bar it kept flipping back and I had to stop shaving to flip it forward. I did notice that the hydro made my shave feel hydrated and smooth but only about half the time.&lt;br /&gt;I do think it gave me a close smooth shave and I did not have to keep going over the same spot to get that close smooth shave. I was very impressed with the overall performance I got from the schick hydro 5 razor. I do like that it has the 5 blades. It almost looks like the refill razors but isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt; I almost felt like I was throwing out a refillable razor when I was finished with it. It has nice grip on the handle and a nice stylish color pattern.&lt;br /&gt; I looked at the store to see about the price to see how it compares to my refill razor and I have to say I think the price is a bit steep for only 3 razors and they are disposable at that. I can go buy my refills for 3 more dollars and get more for my money. But I do think the schick hydro 5 razors are great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt; I like that they have the cover that goes over the blades and it stays in place. The cover is also easy to put back on and remove.&lt;br /&gt; Over all I will recommend this to people. Schick hydro is on the right path to a great razor. I think it is great that a disposable razor nor has 5 blades to get that close smooth shave.</li>
    <li> These razors are definitely worth buying. Going from an electric razor to the Hydro 5 was like night and day. Schick sent me these Razors to try as part of a promotion. I can honestly say, however, that my face felt really smooth afterward and even looked healthy all day. Plus, the fact that it has five blades allowed for an extremely close and clean shave with the benefit of being convenient to use in my morning routine.</li>
    <li> Holy crap!  Best, closest, and fastest shave ive ever done.  Just finished and i was a speed demon. On purpose i didnt shave for a few days and normally would use clippers first to bring the hair down so i dont clog the blades, but this time i didnt and it was great.  Only negative is 5 blades is big and harder to gauge around side burns being particular at edges.  I would highly recommend to buy as long as the price isnt crazy.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like these razors, but alas, the blades are just not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neck was bleeding in several spots by the second shave. I use good quality shaving products--tried both foam and cream (third shave). No difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette, Harry&#x27;s, even Dorco are all better.</li>
    <li> I really liked the close shave i got with the Schick Hydro 5 disposable razor i received from Bzz Agent and i didn&#x27;t have to go over it again there for less irritation on my very sensitive skin. I really liked the hydro bar it did leave my face feeling hydrated and not dry. Overall i liked the closeness i got with this razor over my old razor but after going to the store and comparing the prices of the two i thought the Schick Hydro 5 was a little expensive for a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Very Impressive,especially for a disposable razor! I had given up on disposables years ago and was asked to try these from Schick in return for my review. Was I surprised when I gave these a try! Close shave and no razor burn. It also has a flip and trim feature that allows you to flip back the top plastic edge of the razor so you can get close to places such as under your nose. The razor also has a water activated gel that leaves your skin feeling really smooth!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT RAZOR....LOVE THAT IT KEEPS MY FACE SMOOTH AND FRESH</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor is one of my first disposable razors as I usually use refillable ones. I shaved with one today and was amazed at how well they worked. The 5 blades are similar to the ones found on a Gillette Fusion ProGlide but they perform about the same The blades are spaced out a bit more then the Gillette and most of the time you don&#x27;t feel any tug or pull it just glides over the hair and it&#x27;s gone. The price is pretty reasonable for a three pack and overall they are far cheaper and more efficient than a Gillette refillable. I would definitely recommend them for vacations on which you don&#x27;t want to risk losing your refillable.</li>
    <li> This is as smooth as they say.  I got mine for free for writing this review.  I have only used it one time, and though very smooth, also very sharp.  I cut my ear, thinking it was so smooth, so be careful.</li>
    <li> These are good razors, but I feel bad for throwing away so much when I&#x27;m done. Usually disposables are cheap, flimsy throwaways. These are built better and clearly a lot more sturdy. That&#x27;s good...until you consider the environmental impact of throwing all that stuff in a landfill. I think I&#x27;ll stick with replacing blades only.</li>
    <li> I have used the Schirch Hydro 5 twice now. It does give a close shave. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of disposable razors and usually use the ones with disposable heads. But so far, clean, close shave that lasts the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;flip and trim&amp;#34; thing is too gimmicky with no real use. I didn&#x27;t see any difference between using it and using the razor regularly. I would have preferred a small series of razors that popped out (1/3 the size of the main head) for close trims of goatee/mustache as that is always my problem. All in all, a good disposable . . . if you don&#x27;t mind throwing the entire thing away when it gets too rough.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Very well made and put together. I was hesitant to use it due to having sensitive skin. But it actually worked really well. Leaving no bumps, cuts, grazed or irritations. I loved that it has the 5 blades, unlike the usual 3/4 blades. The hydrating gel on top really left my skin feeling soft and smooth. I highly recommend this product!  And will be buying more soon. I did have trouble figuring out the flip and trim part, the package didn&#x27;t really show me how to use/do it. But i did find the information on the bzzagent campaign. Bzzagent is the one who sent me these to try and to write reviews for people to become more educated in product and how people feel about them. I love bzzagent and everything they do! I will be able to try the trimming part for next time! Thanks Bzzagent!</li>
    <li> I just recieved these razors today in the mail (I recieved them as a promotion) and after a few swipes to get acclimated to the new to me ergonomics of the handle, it was like learning to shave all over again with a tremendous razor, these really work great with less shave time and no clogging as with other disposable razors on the market. They glide smoothly over my face and with less pressure which is needed sometimes to ensure you really get down close. I love them and these will become my new disposable razor of choice. If you are skeptical get some and give &#x27;em a run around the block(your face lol) you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Received free as part of bzzagent promotion: I am truly surprised at the quality of the razor. Having for years used Gillette Mach 3 and most recently, a metal Merkur safety razor, I was not expecting much. One of the biggest surprises was the quality, it is relatively easy to make a razor shark but having a handle that is easy to grip and use is key. The handle is well contoured, not too small and skinny and has lots of rubber grip points on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how did it shave? Honestly as well as any non disposable razor I use. The one thing that was very noticeably different from any other razor I use was the gel/aloe/moisturizing feature. After you finish your shave you can feel the moisturizer on your face, it is very obvious. This is not something I have experienced before in any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suffer from razor burn, which is why I moved away from the Mach 3. After 3 mornings of use, no razor burn which is a surprise as this is a multi blade razor. I think it must be something to do with the moisture strip.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I hate disposable razors. They have never worked for me. Ever. I currently use the Schick Hydro 5 replaceable blade razor and so when I was given the opportunity to try the disposable version I was a bit skeptical but intrigued. I am a once a week shave kind of guy because I have very sensitive skin on my face that gets razor burn easily so my razors take a beating because it has to cut through more stubble than it would if I shaved every day or every other day. So I received the Schick Hydro 5 Disposables and it just so happened to coincide with my weekly shave day. I busted one out of the package and thought they could pass the test if I just shaved like normal. To my complete surprise they worked just like my normal Schick Hydro 5 razor! Same 5 blade close shave, same hydrating gel strip, same flip back trimmer! It was just as though nothing had changed and it was just a regular shave day! These have definitely changed my mind regarding disposable razors for sure! I will most likely continue to use my normal Schick Hydro 5 razor while at home, but if/when I travel I will be picking up a package of these little gems to throw into my luggage! Thank you Schick Hydro 5 Disposables for teaching an old dog new tricks (me)! Thank you to BzzAgent for sending me a sample of these to try!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable shave and cost a fraction of the price of the big name brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Received as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> I received a pack of these as part of a BzzAgent campaign.  I was a little hesitant at first to try them out, because I&#x27;m very much sold on my facial hair trimmer from my Mach5, but if its a freebie, well, I&#x27;ll try anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m one of those guys who I hate to change my razor.  I like to get every last little bit of a shave that I can out of it, and I&#x27;ll reuse it so many times until it goes dull.  That being said, fresh from the case, I think I got a better shave than I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  Sure, my Mach5&#x27;s are nice, but I feel like the gel pack for the lubrication of my face goes so fast on those.  It just mostly melts right off before I get halfway through a stroke.  These Hydro5&#x27;s are much better at that, and even after my first shave, I feel like I&#x27;ve got a much longer life out of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I got mine for free.  But the price of these?  I&#x27;d gladly buy them.  They&#x27;re much lower than the cost of the Mach5&#x27;s, and they feel like they have a longer life and useage, which is funny, seeing the Mach5&#x27;s are built for more of an endurance than these.  Not at all what you normally expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.  One of the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette guy for years and figured Fusion was as good as it was gonna get. The downside, obviously, has been the cost of replacement blades and of course that&#x27;s how they get you. But $13+ for four replacement blades that don&#x27;t really last very long? Ouch.. So today I was in Target to pick up said replacement blades when I saw the Schick Hydro 5. I have to admit I&#x27;ve NEVER been a Schick fan at all. I don&#x27;t know what the difference in blades is (aside from number of blades) but shaving with a Schick always felt like trying to shave with a rusty butter knife. The Schick Quatro is a good example. I tried the Quatro in an effort to save money but knew after one shave it wasn&#x27;t going to work out. The Hydro, however, is FAR superior to the Quatro and easily as good as the Gillette Fusion. Initially I thought the Hydro blade casing might be a little too bulky but that didn&#x27;t turn out to be the case. It&#x27;s a good looking razor, it works really well and best of all the replacement blades are $3 cheaper than Fusion blades.</li>
    <li> wow when I received the Schick hydro 5 disposable razors as a free sample from buzzagent I was very impressed with how well it shaved I had a full beard and it still didn&#x27;t have any trouble getting through it and still gave me the closes shave I have ever had it left no hair behind so I didn&#x27;t have to keep going back over the same spot again and again like other razors and I also didn&#x27;t get any razor burn like I normally get from shaving which is why I grew out a beard in the first place</li>
    <li> I got a free sample from BzzAgent and loved the Schick Hydro 5. It was the closest and best shave I have ever gotten from a disposable razor. I have pretty sensitive skin and it left me smooth without irritation.</li>
    <li> Got mine through a promotion on bzzagent.com. Pretty good 3 pack of disposable razors, 3 units no extra heads, no need to change out razor heads all ready to go. 5 heads for a close shave, the shaving oil really helps out for the shave, had no cuts like other razors used. Like the aloe and e myself. No complaints here would use again and recommend to others to try. Also didn&#x27;t notice the top bit of the lubrication bar flipped out, thanks to another reviewer for pointing it out, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need it but good to know if others might.</li>
    <li> I am one of those guys who only uses a real razor if he is in a wedding. No, not attending a wedding, but in the wedding somehow. But thanks to bzzagent I used it to shave my beard last night. It was a very smooth, close, easy shave. No nicks, and it battled against a thick beard and still did the job.  If I go back to regularly shaving then this would be one I would consider.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a PRO when it comes to shaving.  Started balding in my late 20&#x27;s and have tried them ALL.  I was skeptical about trying disposable blades outside of my standard 2 blade cartridge razor.  These 5 blades are phenomenal!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving for over 10 years now and I am impressed with these Hydro razors.  I have never had this close of a shave and to have it last throughout my day is a bonus.  I shave daily, and have done so for over 10 years and these are truly the best razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Schick!!!</li>
    <li> Great product i got to try as a promotion from schick. Smooth, close, and comfortable shave every time but in disposable form. Must try these razors, you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I spent most of my life using an electric shaver and made the shift to the razors.  I don&#x27;t love shaving.  I want it to be fast, smooth, and easy.  After trying out a bunch of different razors, the Schick hit the mark.  It is a nice, close, easy shave with 5, that&#x27;s right, FIVE blades.  The grip on the handle is an easy hold and make it easy when I am half asleep in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like the hydrating gel.  Some reviews mentioned the lubricating/hydrating gel was a little too much.  For me, it was just right.  A little aloe is good on the face, especially in cold, dry, winter months.  All in all, a great razor.</li>
    <li> Best &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; razor I have used. Got this as a bzzagent test product and I was very surprised by the quality. I did not experience any razor burn or rash after using the razor.</li>
    <li> such an amazing product, this is one of the few products that i will definitly keep on buying because it is smooth to the skin, it it comes in such a great package and it does not leave marks on your face after the shave. 5/5</li>
    <li> I have been using these razors for a couple weeks now. They are good but not great. I like the way the razor looks and the way it shaves. On the flat parts of my face it shaves extremely nice. The bad part is that it does not get to my hard to get places like right under my nose and places on my neck. The head is also a little floppy. I need to place my finger behind the head to hold it in place to shave. That said if I was in the market for a new razor I would definitely consider this brand and model.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as a promotional campaign from BzzAgent. I decided to give them a couple of weeks before submitting any type of review in order to share a more accurate experience and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette Mach 3 for years now and I&#x27;m reasonably happy with it. My facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow in super thick or fast, so I really only shave between 2 to 3 time a week. That being said, my first impression of the Hydro 5 disposables was: &amp;#34;I had no idea what I&#x27;ve been missing!&amp;#34; The Hydro 5 has a built in moisturizing reservoir that expels a gooey liquid of some kind (presumably an aloe concoction) as you wet the razor to keep the strokes nice and smooth. I use them in conjunction with my Gillette shave Gel, but I imagine in a pinch you&#x27;d be alright to some extent without a gel or foam, I&#x27;m not brave enough to try though. I&#x27;ve never bought into the gimmick of adding as many blades to a razor as will fit in the package, but I gotta say, the extra blades do seem to make quite a difference as far as closeness and number of strokes. If your skin is sensitive like mine you want to use as few strokes as possible to cut down the razor burn. They came in a pack of three, so I gladly shared them with my wife to shave her legs and I&#x27;ve heard no complaints as of yet. Two weeks later I am still reasonably pleased with the product, but I find myself missing the heft of my Mach 3 Titanium. I tend to feel the need to press harder than I feel is safe due to its lack of substance. Unfortunately the full on metal Schick Hydro is a bit feminine looking aesthetically when compared to the comparable Gillette offerings. I would still consider one, but I would want to play the field before settling down.</li>
    <li> i was in need of some good quality razors for shaving. these ones are a good choice. they get close when you shave. the head kinda rotates which makes it easier. has a good amount of blades. very easy to shave with these. i would recommend these to anybody looking for good quality razors</li>
    <li> I used the Schick Hydro 5 disposable and compared it to my Gillite fusion proglide power.  I even shaved the left side of my face with the Gillite and the right side with the Schick. I really like this razor. So much so, that I am switching. I have not switched razor brands in 20+ years. The 5 blades cut great.. the best part is the little pockets of awesomeness.. they are fantastic. From the first swipe you can feel the gel sooth your skin. The Hydrating Gel Reservoir is great! After two weeks, I decided to just use the Hydro 5 on my whole face! I have now used it for 4 almost 5 weeks, and the same razor is going strong. There is still awesomeness in the reservoir! With the price and performance, I am very very happy with this Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product, very nice shave.</li>
    <li> I gave them a fair chance, and I am certainly not one to hold on to a razor just for brand recognition. I have changed razors in the past for a better shave, and this one did not convince. This was absolutely horrid, and did not do the job a good razor should.&lt;br /&gt;For one, it is too bulky around every edge, making it very difficult to conform to the contours of the face. I struggled around jawline and lip, and even to get close to my ear was a problem; and you better start praying to whatever gods you worship right now if you happen to have even a slight cleft chin.&lt;br /&gt;Then we move on to the &amp;#34;water activated shave gels&amp;#34; which are supposed to be our little helper. They are more hindrance than help. It must be made from the most slick, oily substance on earth because all it seems to do is attach to the hair and cause the blade to glide over it without cutting. An area that would normally be one stroke now takes five, and that is counting a flat surface that the razor&#x27;s shape doesn&#x27;t get in the way of. Then, washing the gel off takes a while, because it sticks to your face like a thin, greasy film.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, nothing about this razor is easy, convenient, or helpful. It was the worst shave of my life, and I strongly recommend against it. If you do wish to find out for yourself, I STRONGLY suggest purchasing a single pack of the smallest count you can find to sample before wasting your money. I believe the smallest I have seen is the three pack.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for the price, Would have never thought you would be able to buy a disposable that was just as good as a non-disposable, got a 3 pack for free and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I am very much a straight edge razor kind of guy. Old school but wow do these things glide. I have never had a razor glide over my face the way this one did. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s no straight edge but it&#x27;s the next best thing in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I enjoy a good shave. These really surprised me as I didn&#x27;t expect a disposable razor to shave me so well! I already bought more!</li>
    <li> I received these as a free trial, I&#x27;d have to say as far as disposables go I am very pleased with the overall quality of these razors.  The gel lubricates and leaves my face smooth and moist.  I did not have any issue with razor burn like I typically do with disposables.  These really are a great value!</li>
    <li> I normally shave using electric, but my standby disposable has been the Schick Quattro.  I wanted to try to the Hydro 5 for a couple of weeks before submitting a review.  I thought the razor was very comfortable to hold.  Others have noted they thought it was too bulky, but for me it was just fine.  The razor offered a nice clean shave with no irritation similar to the Quattro.  The flip back top which allows you to get to tight areas is an interesting approach and works well for the most part.  But I prefer a razor that has a small top blade on the back side for such uses.  The one thing that I thought would set this razor apart from the Quattro was the lube reservoirs.  Instead of the typical lube strip on many disposable, the Hydro 5 offers what appear to be several small pockets of lube across the top surface of the razor.  I was assuming this allowed more lube to be available and thus would not dry up as soon as the typical lube strips.  But to my disappointment, it did not seem to offer much, if any, extra lube &amp;#34;life&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the Hydro 5 is a very nice disposable.  The Hydro 5 is slightly more expensive than the Quattro.  For me, the price differnce isn&#x27;t worth it.  So for now, my standby disposable will continue to be the Quattro.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor gives a decent shave. The first use is definitely hydrating. Almost a little too much. It&#x27;s strip is a little slimy feeling and the head is a little large so be careful shaving under and up around your nose. It left my face incredibly smooth though. My wife noticed the difference! The second time is about perfect, but left a little stubble on the sides of my neck. The third shave I found what I always tend to find with disposables razors. It lost it&#x27;s edge and it was time for a new one. At this price I&#x27;m not sure I would buy them regularly since I&#x27;m tossing them as often as cheaper razors!</li>
    <li> I was given this product for free from Schick through BzzAgent to try out.  I typically use an electric razor but decided to give these a try.  In the past it always seemed to take a lot longer to shave with a manual razor plus the risk of getting cut.  I can definitely say that this razor took away those fears.  The hydration gel that is built into the razor really helped with a smooth shave.  I also like the large area of the razor which makes the razor less likely to nick while shaving.  I&#x27;m definitely sold on these disposables....they do a great job!!!</li>
    <li> I have never been a huge fan of disposable razors. I&#x27;ve always tried to stick with regular razors with the replaceable heads. They&#x27;re a bit spendy, but I always thought they gave a better shave. On the few instances I&#x27;ve needed to use disposable razors, I&#x27;d always tried Mach3&#x27;s, as they seemed the best quality of the bunch. But I was actually excited to try these Schick Hydro 5&#x27;s when I received them from BzzAgent, as the Schick Hydro 5&#x27;s are my preferred regular razor. My expectations were exceeded. These don&#x27;t feel like disposables at all, and give a great close, smooth shave that is easy on the skin. (I have sensitive skin, so that&#x27;s a big plus for me). And one razor still gives the same great shave after many shaves. Again, I can&#x27;t say enough about these disposables, and I recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> One of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve used. Has a nice grip to it and it&#x27;s very sharp. The gel strip is very nice and you can feel it with every stroke.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a very smooth shave. It even has a trimmer!</li>
    <li> Great product, I got a free sample thru buzzagent and loved them. I would recommend them!</li>
    <li> but, I had never tried disposables quite like these.  As a BzzAgent, I got these for free to try.  Normally I am not a fan of disposable razors, but these worked very well, giving a close shave with no razor burn.  Also, they seem to last longer than other disposables I have used in the past.  Try them out for yourself!</li>
    <li> I give very little thought to what I use to shave with.  My wife brings home random cheap razors, I use them once or twice, I throw them away and grab a new one.  That cycle might have been broken since I have tried Schick Hydro 5.  I first tried them on four days of stubble and it went right through without irritating my skin.  I will definitely use these again in the future</li>
    <li> Its a great shave for a disposable but it didn&#x27;t seem to get as close to the skin as my Gillette Fusion but definitely a close second. I did enjoy the gel reservoir kept my face from drying out after my shave. If I was someone whose skin gets irritated a lot by shaving I think this feature would be a great option for them. ***I did Receive them as a sample***</li>
    <li> #gotitfree these razors are good. The gel makes for a smooth shave and the soft handle is comfy. My only draw back is the wide head due to the 5 blades but that&#x27;s it good razor otherwise</li>
    <li> I travel a LOT (for both work and fun) and nothing pains me more than realizing I forgot my razor. I usually use cartridges but I love that these are convenient, have a blade protector, and give a very close, comfortable shave. I plan to keep one of these stashed away in my bag at all times. Plus, it&#x27;s good to know I can pick one up when I&#x27;m on the road and don&#x27;t have any handy.</li>
    <li> Best Disposable Razor out there no doubt about that! It exceeded my expectations for a disposable, yet! it gets the best close shave without drying your skin out. Not to mention the flip and trim feature that allows for easier trimming made everything just a little better</li>
    <li> I was able to try these razors out for free and very glad that I was able too as I may not have tried them otherwise. I love the clean shave that I have with these and it seems to extend the timeframe between shaving!</li>
    <li> Shaving with these razors feels like your just wiping your your stubble off you can&#x27;t even feel the blades....very cool. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the head swivels way to easy...</li>
    <li> These are amazing. Cuts wayyyyy smoother than Gillette Fusion. A+++</li>
    <li> The razor is pretty nice as a disposable razor.  Does what a razor is suppose to do.  A smooth shave and the hydrating gel is great.  The only difference from the counterpart, non disposable razor is the disposable razor is a bit flimsy compared to the non-disposable.  It isn&#x27;t as solid of a razor (weight) as the non-disposable razor.  But everything else is comparable.  The shave is the same, but again if you take the consideration of the weight of the razor, then it can feel a bit cheap.  A lot better than your typical disposable razor; that&#x27;s for sure.  I received three samples.  I gave two away to close buddies of mine and asked them for their review.  They actually liked it a lot and couldn&#x27;t believe it was a disposable razor.  They like the look, feel and the convenience of being able to toss the razor after they were done with it.</li>
    <li> I received these as a trial from #BzzAgent #SchickDisposables #GotItFree. I am the type of guy that doesn&#x27;t like to shave with a razor very often because it tends to dry out my skin and just overall discomfort. However since I got these I figured I&#x27;d give them a try. I&#x27;ll tell you what they are pretty darn good! Very close comfortable shave and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry! Comfortable grip to the handle as well. My wife decided to even try one since she ran out of her razors and needless to say I haven&#x27;t seen them since. She loves them and I really liked them as well. Good Product!</li>
    <li> These razors do not feel like they are disposable. They cut real close and smooth. They have a strip that really puts in work by lessening irritation.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro 5 gels are pretty good in my opinion. They don&#x27;t last as long as Dollar Shave Club or the Gillette Fusions, but they&#x27;re a really good, inexpensive alternative. I got my first batch of these from BzzAgent as a promotion from Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity:&lt;br /&gt;Each razor lasts me about a week. I shave after a hot shower and use shaving cream. After a week, I feel like I don&#x27;t get as close of a shave. The razors aren&#x27;t too expensive, so I don&#x27;t really mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort and Control:&lt;br /&gt;The gel strip on the top is great. It provides an extremely smooth shave that trumps the Gillette. However, it is a bit bulky. It makes shaving in smaller places (like right under your nose) a bit hard. BUT! Schick has countered this with the fact that the gel strip is retractable. I like it. It makes it smaller and more accurate without losing much comfort. The Gillette has a just single razor for accurate trims. The handle isn&#x27;t perfect, but their disposable and they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning this razor is extremely easy. With my Gillette Fusion and DSC razors, the shave gel combined with small hairs get stuck between the blades almost every single time. With this Schick, it cleans out very easy. A simple rinse and you&#x27;re done. Schick spaces the blades out a little further, which adds to the largeness of the razor head, but I definitely prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;d Like:&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d like is a holder for the razors so that they can air dry better. With the cap on, it retains moisture so it doesn&#x27;t really dry well by the next morning. I generally leave it off and rest the razor on top of the cap, which works decent enough.</li>
    <li> These are good but they are not my Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a free trial of these razors as part of a promotion from Schick and they are amazing! the best disposable razor you will possibly use! If you haven&#x27;t tried them yet, they are definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Great razors for the price.  4 out of 5: needs one more blade on top (sideburn trim etc)</li>
    <li> I go from having facial hair to not.  I like to change things up.  When I got this offer to try Schick hydro disposable for free I was pretty excited.  I have used schick before and have liked it.  Now my experience with disposable razors has not been very good.  They usually don&#x27;t last a whole shave and it&#x27;s never close. When I tried these ones I was very surprised.  They left a close smooth shave and have lasted.  I love them. They can be used for a quick cleanup or a full shave and you are still left with a smooth clean face!!! I would highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> The only razors I will buy.</li>
    <li> hydro shave work very well they could use a little bit more hydro on the Blade, other than that a great blade!</li>
    <li> I usually use a replaceable head razor for my facial grooming needs, but I was invited to try the Schick Hyrdro 5 disposable.&lt;br /&gt;The name itself is well designed- the moisturizing strip that is above the razor blades works well, at least after the first few strokes of the razor. It could be improved if the strip were activated just by the water and was ready to use. Good, smooth, close shave though.&lt;br /&gt;Could last a little longer, but it does outlast the cheap store brand disposables that I have tried. All in all, not a bad choice if you either use a disposable currently, or you need to grab one to use when you don&#x27;t have your normal blade available!&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree</li>
    <li> Amazing! It shaves so smooth and no irritation! So far, I used five times and still shaves as close as the first time! Trimmer works a lot better than Gillette! I highly recommend to everyone! I received​ it for free from Schick Hydro as a promotion!</li>
    <li> I personally am a huge fan of this brand, but I was disappointed with Schick Hydro® 5 Disposables during the initial first use.&lt;br /&gt;  When I started to use the razor for the first time, I had to stop mid stroke because it felt as if each individual hair that I was attempting to shave was being pulled out (like it would feel if I was using a pair of tweezers)&lt;br /&gt;  Despite this uncomfortable feeling, I continued to use the product because of my loyalty to this particular brand. When I finished, I did have a close shave, but I also had a surprising amount of razor burn all the way around my neck.&lt;br /&gt;  In hopes of this razor working better the 2nd time, I again began to use that  same razor I had before and I noticed immediately that each stroke was painless compared to the first time of use.&lt;br /&gt;  When I finished using the razor the 2nd time, as promised I had an impressively close, smooth &amp; sufficient shave without any sign of razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these Schick Hydro® 5 Disposables as a promotion offered from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was requested by Lance R to post this product review on my Amazon.com account due to not having any purchases made on his own Amazon.com, you can see his Amazon.com profile at the following link  &amp;#62;&amp;#62; http://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A10IYR3K9RG05D &amp;#60;&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> I received these razors for free to test. I really HATE these razors. I&#x27;ve been using a mail order razor system for about 8 months now. I wanted to try these to save some coin. Very big mistake. I use CB Bigelow Shave Cream (B&amp;BW) and these just made a huge gooey mess all over my face. I would definitely not recommend these disposable razors. Stick to the shave club or the cartridge version of the Hydro 3 or 5.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as part of a promotion from Schick and was really surprised as how good it was compared to their more expensive products. This razor gives you a smooth close shave. I would definitely recommend it. My skin also feels really soft after using it.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro 5 for evaluation as a Bzzagent –&lt;br /&gt;I should first state that I don’t like to shave, just not a fan of the nicks, cuts and razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;So when the opportunity came along to try the Schick Hydro 5 I was rather ho hum about it but figured what the heck, I have to shave occasionally, like it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the Schick Hydro 5 was a very pleasant surprise, it not only gives a clean comfortable shave, I had zero cuts, irritation or other such troubles.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to handle pivots nicely the lubrication strips are a great help and they have TWO for a change so you get the benefit of the lubrication from the first strip before the blade does its thing.&lt;br /&gt;The top lube strip also flips up and out of the way so that you can get a nice trim around beardline and such.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, think you will too!</li>
    <li> I am mainly and electric razor man.  But I used to use Mach 5&#x27;s.  I stopped because of the price.  I don&#x27;t know how the Schick razors compare pricewise, but I would use them definately if they were cheaper than Mach 5&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> stays sharp!!! No dragging of the skin. great razor for a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Received the product and I feel it does the well enough. If you want your face feeling smooth this razor feels like it almost glides on your face as you shave. Lubricant strips help make the job easier. I don&#x27;t think its the best but for the price it&#x27;s better than most.</li>
    <li> I have a beard, so most of the time that I use a shaver is high on the cheeks and around the neck line. This razer did more than fine in those areas. I didn&#x27;t get any razor burn after and the lubricant almost did too good of a job, as it was a little tough at times to feel the hair being cut. This is a pretty large razer too. Good for guys with large hands. Overall I would say give it a go, for sure.</li>
    <li> Shaving is my least favorite activity to do.  I can’t stand it but thanks to the Schick hydo this activity just became so much easier to do.  So far I have only used this razor straight, without shaving cream, and I am thrilled to say doing it this way gives you a smooth close shave and no razor burn thanks to the lubricant that is on the razor.  Also the shave is so close that I don’t get the “5 o’clock” shadow that I have been so used to.  I can basically go up to two days or more without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The grip to the handle also makes shaving more comfortable as well.&lt;br /&gt;This is now my favorite shaver and I won’t use anything else</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used one of these in quite a while but really loved the moisturizing I felt.  I am definitely going to keep some on hand and use them for travelling.</li>
    <li> I a Buzz Agent and was part of the Schick Hydro 5 Campaign. I was given a pack of the Hydro 5 Razors and have been using them for well over a month and I was really impressed how nice of a close shave that I got from them. I only had to go with one pass rather than going over it a couple times in order to get a clean cut. I had given my wife a razor to try out and see how it worked on her legs. She was also very impressed with the final out come of a nice close shave and another thing we both noticed was it didn&#x27;t get clogged up like other razors do. I would recommend the Schick Hydro 5 Razors to anyone who wants a nice clean shave without clogging up or pulling. One nice thing is there made for use for both women and men.</li>
    <li> Affordable razor that lasts a long time! Other razors after a few uses the razor dulls and it catches on my hair and I end up cutting my skin. This one is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;My face felt smoother after use too, so the lotion addition that they have on these really does work. All around a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;I was given these razors for a free trial from Bzzagent, but all my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have not tried anything except for gillette products, so I was excited to try something new. I was very impressed with the way the razor holds up. It keeps my face and neck so smooth. I have to shave everyday so I need a good razor. And this razor really holds up. I really like this razor instead of the gillette razor. I really love the fact that this razor comes with five blades. I have tried some other razor that have had less and it does work on me. So this razor gets the job done. I would recommend this product to anyone that has to shave on a daily bases</li>
    <li> Got a few razors for free through bzzagent, and at first my girlfriend and I were really impressed. The first few shaves were really close and the hydration was nice. The detailer is convenient and easily accessible, and a neat feature to have on a throwaway. Over time however the razors lost their luster. The neat razor did not perform nearly as well as the first, and the gel slick it leaves behind gets old fast. It&#x27;s a cool razor for sometimes, but not a consistent goto blade. Good for cold and dry days.</li>
    <li> This razor performs very well. It is better than any other disposable razor I have ever used. It left my face clean and smooth with no nicks or cuts even on 3 day growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette disposables (the standard 2 blade available at Costco) from a long time. BzzAgent gave me an opportunity to try the Schick Hydro 5 disposable razor and here&#x27;s my feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look/Design : The design of the Schick Hydro 5 is like mostly same as other disposables available in the market. The blue color used in the razor blends it with the razor name - &amp;#34;Hydro&amp;#34;. The handle provides a soft yet good grip. The Razor head contains 5 blades with equidistant spaces to provide clean shave without any nick sticking in-between.&lt;br /&gt;I particularly liked the razor head design which is designed such a way that it provides clean shave without any cuts and provide easy glide on the face be it chin, cheek or around the neck area. Oh and not to mention, its a light weight razor (even though it contains big razor head with 5 blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage : I have been using the same razor form last 2 weeks and still I get a clean shave with Schick hydro 5. Its definitely a long-lasting razor compared to other available in market. (for sure last longer than the Gillette disposables).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication : The razor provides long lasting lubricant gel that lasts 2X longer than the normal lubricant razor heads. The hydrating gel lubricates while shaving that reduces irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its very good long-lasting disposable razor that does the job better than other disposable razor available in the market. Highly recommend everyone.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample pack from #Shick and #Bzzagent. I will write the following review as accurately as possible, having been given samples from multiple companies including Schick, Gillete, and others. I have tried over 10 different disposable shavers from a variety of different manufacturers and to me this is quite the average shaver. It doesn&#x27;t stand out for its comfort, but is not painful. It&#x27;s shave is quite clean, leaving small hair particles, but nothing out of the ordinary. I have used this shaver for about three weeks now. Each and every time, the act of shaving has been painfree and quite easy. This is better than the Gillette Mach 3, which due to its slightly sharper blades dug deeper into the skin, whereas this one did not. I usually shave before bed, but when I wake up the next morning, the skin is itchy, unlike any shaver I have ever used. I am not sure if this is a result of a mild allergy or the way this shaver digs into the skin, but it definitely stung for quite sometime. This left me quite disappointed as I had a high hopes for this shaver. Alas, it is like many others merely average in its class. Hope the next version will be better, as this razor has quite a lot of potential. Like all razors, I definitely recommend trying it out yourself to see what you think.</li>
    <li> The blades were great! Definitely one of my favorite. Despite the little rash I always get after my shaves, these guys stood out to be ones of my favorite</li>
    <li> These were way better than the other store brand razors I tried. Clearly cheaper is not better when it comes to disposable razors ;) I was worried that I would need to have shaving cream as well but that turned out to not be the case. The razor does a really good job of lubricating. I did receive these as a sample but I ended up being really impressed by them.</li>
    <li> This razor is great! Very smooth and easy to use. I lived how sharp and precise it was.</li>
    <li> Razor works well and isnt too expensive.  Shave oils give a creamy sensation that might actually work.  Once the first layer of shaving cream is gone the razor kinda adds another layer on its own.  Shave is fairly close and the beard trimmer actually works.  Overally not a bad choice for a decent shave.</li>
    <li> These Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razors are great for use in the shower and provide a very close shave, indeed. I had originally selected these for my use, but after receiving them decided that these would work better for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has used these twice now on her legs, about a week a part, and reports that she likes the comfortable and easy to grip handle, the moisturizing strip that actually works, and the closeness of the shave. It is likely that these will last for at least one or two more shaves before needing to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> My husband usually uses Mach 3 Turbo razors but he decided to give these a try. He did not see a difference in his shave with the two extra blades the Schick Hydro offered and his skin seemed just as smooth to me as when he uses the Mach 3. He did however really like the grip of the handle and the hydration strip on these razors.</li>
    <li> I like the Schick Hydro line of products and this razor works just fine in keeping with their usual quality. The blades last a while, and the shave is relatively smooth. I do have to say that I prefer the powered Hydro over the disposable non-powered variety simply because the shave is slightly smoother and easier, but on a budget these will do the trick.</li>
    <li> I have been using mach3 cartridge for over 8 years. Thought I will try this one for a change. It is awesome. Shave is very smooth with 4 blades. Each piece almost last me for a month, with everyday shave. Plus this costs much less than a replaceable cartridge.</li>
    <li> Great razor and smooth shave!</li>
    <li> I am always a little unsure when trying a new razor, especially when it&#x27;s disposable.  These schick hydro 5 razors were very easy to use, provided a comfortable close shave and don&#x27;t even require shaving cream or gel so saves me money. This was a free trial product that I plan on continuing to use.</li>
    <li> very nice razor cuts hair like butter like the thumb grip smooth action and nice moisturizing with the shave  would buy again little pricey but can use for a long time would tell others to try</li>
    <li> For a disposable razor these are excellent. Worth the price for a close and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor. I used this in both the disposable and replaceable and both give me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The blades glide across my face getting almost all of my coarse beard in one pass at most two. I don&#x27;t even mind the second pass because it&#x27;s so smooth and frictionless. This leads to minimal razor burn. Highly recommend trying these out.</li>
    <li> I recently received a package of these razors to test out from Schick and BzzAgent. I don&#x27;t do a whole lot of shaving, since I&#x27;m usually rocking the full beard, but I do need a good razor around for the few instances shaving is necessary. These disposables are great for those instances and I&#x27;ve found them to be very gentle on sensitive skin, but still aggressive enough to trim through a small forest. I&#x27;ve used the same razor several times and it seems to hold up pretty well, so I imagine a 3-pack will last a casual shaver a good long time. I wouldn&#x27;t consider these or any other disposables a replacement for regular shavers, but it works perfectly for my purpose. Infrequent shavers should definitely check these out!</li>
    <li> This disposable starts by being five blades that shave just as well as my Gillette Fusion. The only way the cut would be better is to buy a vibrating razor, such as the Gillette Fusion. However, this razor leaves my skin feeling more moisturized and less raw than the Gillette Fusion, by including a tank of moisturizer. The tank doesn&#x27;t get in the way, as it can be flipped back to trim hairlines. When you do so, all five blades become useful for the trim, so that&#x27;s actually better than my Fusion, which only allows one blade to be useful for trimming. Received free as sample to review, and really liked it.</li>
    <li> I recently used Schick Hydro 5 Disposable razors and you wouldn&#x27;t even know you were using a disposable razor. You would think you were using a regular razor and wouldn&#x27;t even notice the difference.  I have been a huge fan of schick and it is my go to brand and this razor only justifies my decision and makes me feel like I have made a smart decision over the years.  It provided a comfortable and close shave with no irritation and they surprisingly lasted a long time for a disposable razor.  It was probably one of the most comfortable shaves I have had in a long time and you don&#x27;t even notice the blades gliding over your skin.  Anyone up for a comfortable shave  and challenge me to find a better shave?</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent, I was privileged to try Schick&#x27;s Hydro 5 disposable razor. I have always associated disposables with compromised performance and higher cost compared to refillable razors, but that is not the case with these. They perform better than my refillable Mach 3 razor (amazingly smooth and close, plus they have that cool flip-up feature for trimming edges) and cost less than the Mach 3 refills. I can stash these in my luggage, backpack, motorcycle… anything I might have with me when I might spend a planned or unplanned night away.</li>
    <li> As a Bzzagent, I was able to try this awesome disposable. My face is so smooth everytime I use this thing. Highly recommended! Thanks to Schick for sending me this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using disposable razors for years, and received the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable as part of a promotion. My go to razor has three blades, and has served me well throughout the years. I had high hopes for this razor, as it raised the razor count from three to five. Two extra blades &#x3D; better shaver performance, right? Well.....not necessarily. My first shave with each razor was a bit of a blood bath. Nics all over the place. Also, the razors seemed to get clogged rather quickly and it was hard to rise out (I use a gel foam). The hydrating gel reservoir left a slime trail behind. I can&#x27;t say that this made any huge impact, other than the slime effect. I did like that the head of the razor flipped down to allow to get in close under the nose. It also let me get a good line on my sideburns. Subsequent shaves proved to be a bit better. It&#x27;s almost like I had to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; the razor. The hydrating gel reservoir didn&#x27;t seem to last more than two shaves....at least that&#x27;s when the slimer effect seemed to settle down. I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this razor...I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d switch from what I currently use to this one. The extra blades didn&#x27;t lead to a smoother shave and the gel reservoir didn&#x27;t make a huge impact. I did like the flip down head that allows you to get in closer.</li>
    <li> So these get 3 stars for just being the best disposables I&#x27;ve used, but there are 2 glaring faults with them that I have. First, disposables create a lot of waste so I&#x27;m simply not a big fan. Second, if you want a very close shave, you&#x27;ll have to look elsewhere. With that said, for disposables that you may pick up say while you&#x27;re on travel, these will definitely do the job pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This review was written after receiving a free sample of the product from BzzAgent. The fact that the sample was free did not influence my review in the slightest.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as part of a Bzzagent campaign. I shave almost everyday and I&#x27;m a Gilette man. This is the first razor that really made me think about changing my stance on that. The first thing you notice when you pick this razor up is the quality. It has the heft of a razor with a changeable head. You also get a gel strip that lasts a surprising long time and a single blade for tight spaces. These are things that you don&#x27;t normally see in a disposable. If that weren&#x27;t enough, each blade has a skin guard to make sure you get a clean smooth shave. The angle of the blades are very shallow, which ensures a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this razor is the shallow angle of the blades. While they do give a very close shave, if you have more than a day&#x27;s growth, the blades may snag and pull the hairs instead of cutting it smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that small snag, these razors will definitely surprise you with it&#x27;s bevy of features and super close shave.</li>
    <li> A fantastic razor that lasts a long time and gives me a nice clean shave. Really an incredible item!</li>
    <li> The strip on the razor is awesome. It&#x27;s extremely lubricating and makes shaving smooth. By the way, I&#x27;m a girl, but it gives me slight irritation on the back of my legs...hence 4/5 stars</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel like a disposable razor. It is sturdy and has a nice thick handle. I got a great and comfortable shave with it. Unfortunately, the price does not reflect a disposable razor either and it seems to me that you could get replacement razor heads for cheaper than these. If for some reason you need a razor to be disposable though, I would recommend these because they are so nice.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors that you can buy.  I have used far more expensive razors and blades, and after using the Schick Hydro 5 Disposables, I find that there is absolutely no reason to spend more on more expensive razors or blades.  It gives me the smoothest, closest and least irritating shave.  Don&#x27;t bother spending more, just buy these and dispose when you need a new one.</li>
    <li> My brother introduced me to these razors while on a trip last year. I converted from the G brand that I&#x27;ve used for many years. The titanium blades seem to last much longer than the G brand. The head is a little larger than my previous razors, probably partly due to it being five bladed. This makes it a little harder to shave around my nose/mustache area, but it&#x27;s worth the tradeoff for a good, close shave, and much longer lasting blades. I&#x27;m assuming that the titanium material helps to extend the life.</li>
    <li> I think these were generic, not Schick razors.</li>
    <li> These are not great but they are still much better than the Schick Hydro silk version for women. They are not irritating. The Schick Hydro has a lubricating strip which is more sticky than lubricating. But it did not leave my skin irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro did leave me with hair still on my legs though. It is pretty annoying. I am at a loss at to how 5 blades are an advantage if they are still missing hair. I am better off with with a cheapy one blade mans schick disposable and a bottle of shave gel.</li>
    <li> These razors do not give a close enough shave.  They glide nicely over the skin and do not cause cuts or burns, but it does leave a light stubble.  If you don&#x27;t want a super close shave, then these are the razors for you.</li>
    <li> This razor shaves well, but 5 blades seem to make me more prone to cutting myself.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s that the surface for shaving is larger than the 2-3 bladed razors that I&#x27;m used to or the shape of the handle and this the angle that I&#x27;m shaving at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think that I would spend the current list price for 3 of these, as there are slightly cheaper razors that I prefer, but should this be my only choice, I would pick them up again.</li>
    <li> Five blades work very well and keeps your skin protected and extra smooth.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
    <li> You would really have to be clumsy to cut yourself with these razors..</li>
    <li> Great Disposable Razor.  I got it in the mail to test and what can say, I love the handle.  Great Grip that prevents slipping while shaving which can cause lots of nicks and cuts.  The razors provided a very clean shave of the first pass.  I did not have to do much cleanup after I was done with the first pass.  No razor burn or bumps after the shave.  Overall, i would say for a disposable razor, these are as good as it comes.  Pick up a pack today, you won&#x27;t be let down.</li>
    <li> Happy with these razors.  Price is a bit high.</li>
    <li> AWESOME I RECOOMEND IT DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BY FAR THAT I HAVE EVER USED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product to review from bzzagent thank you</li>
    <li> I shave my head and face a few times a week so I go through razors.  I want my skin to feel silky smooth after a shave.  I don&#x27;t want any razor bumps or irritations.  As of my first shave, my head and face feel refreshed.  I definitely recommend this product to any avid shaver.</li>
    <li> Best disposable razor money can buy. Provided a smooth clean burn free shave.</li>
    <li> Great, clean, smooth, safe shave the first time!  No nicks, no pesky rough patches.  Cut through heavy growth in one pass.  Its a shame to dispose of this razor because it works better than my daily blades!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using  the older original Schick xtreme3 for years and thought I already had a close smooth shave. This thing is much better at giving me a close shave. I haven&#x27;t tested the durability yet but I trust Schick as I&#x27;ve always used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;5 blades give you good clean smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;Gel reservoir helps the razor glide easily( better than the xtreme3)&lt;br /&gt;no razor burn&lt;br /&gt;comes in pack of 3 (handle and razor head each)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the razor head is bulkier than other average disposables&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Very solid disposable razors, worth the price.  I&#x27;m the type of guy that travels a fair amount, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to take a razor with me on the go, that&#x27;s decent/high quality, and that I can get rid of before I come home.  I received these razors as a promotional item, and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with them.  Very close shave, and glides pretty well.</li>
    <li> Have been using Gillette Mach 3 for as long as I can remember. Tried some thing else between was not happy so went back to it. When I received this as a free sample I was skeptic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But was surprised, the shave was smooth and easy on my skin. So for its 4 Star. will have to see how many shave I can this razor give with out having to dispose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a very big fan of disposable razors. I don&#x27;t like how it feels in hand. Its too light, this is no different since its made of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are good, not sure if having five of them are any better, but they look and fee like  regular ones. it remains to see how many shaves it last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smooth hydration is \\&quot;good\\&quot;, but I did not like sticky feeling that much, but I suppose it might be of some help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Over all I like it, it felt comparable to regular Gillette razor. If price is good I might switch over for good!</li>
    <li> I got to trial these for BzzAgent. Amazing shave for a disposable I will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> I do NOT use disposable or any razor other than electric... normally. This is because I have not found a comfortable razor other than electric. I hate to nick my face and feel the razor rip at the hairs as it attempts to cut them. I used the cheapest shave cream I could find (a bar of hand soap) because I did not want to skew the results by reviewing the shave cream instead of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is NOT at all what I expected. I have used disposables in the past and this is not in the same class. It was comfortable as it left a protective film on my face as I shaved to make the razor glide across my cheeks, chin and neck. It completely surprised me as it did what it was it was built to do with complete comfort while providing the closest shave I have had in a long time. My wife asked me what I did to make my face so smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intentionally have not shaved for three days, and my facial hair grows in thick and fast. This razor had no problem tackling my growth in comfort and with ease. When I went to rinse the razor I expected the blades to become clogged with hair, which they never did. The hair rinsed right away to enable me to continue shaving. The flip away strip on the top is awesome in that I was able to get even closer to my nose to get those stubborn hairs that grow right next to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I will probably continue to use an electric razor these are definitely going into my kit in case there is a power outage or other need where my electric razor cannot be used.Either way, there will be some kept in my car in case I forget to shave before work, which has happened. Who knows, with many more shaves like this one I may switch and always use these instead...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Stephen Hoemke</li>
    <li> I received a sample of these to try.  I am not normally a disposable razor guy.  I shave daily, and the Schick Hydro 5 give a close shave without the razor burn.  I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price! Usually go with the expensive $20+ razors. Decided to try these and could not tell a difference. Nice close shave and a great price.</li>
    <li> I generally use an double edged safety razor 2-3 per month. The Hydro 5 is one of the best blades I have ever used. With 5 blades it cuts smoothly, has an excellent glide over the face, and I cannot recall ever cutting myself even when pressed for time and shaving a little fast. In addition the hyrdo 5 blade design is such that it cleans under the facuet better than any blade I have tried. It both cleans completely but also quickly. That may not sound like much, but it contributes greatly to how well this cuts and how quickly you can complete your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a flip down ability, where the lubrication bar on top of the razor will flip out of the way. I actually use it as it helps get under the nose and also get the sideburn area straighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a premium razor but at the same time has a performance that is also premium.</li>
    <li> I participated in a schick hydro challenge, to test out their razor.  I found the razor was quite smooth of a shave in big areas of the face.  I found that when trying to get the tight areas such as under the nose was quite difficult with the gel aspect.  I also found I had to clear the razor more often that other razors.  When I typically shave in the mornings, I am trying to hurry and the extra time it took to get under the nose and continuous rinsing was quite annoying.  I would give the razor an overall rating of 3 due to the extra time and how close of a shave it gave over all.</li>
    <li> These Schick  Hydro 5 Razors Are GREAT i received these free to review from Bzzagent They have exceeded my expectations of what a disposable razors are or what they used to be i&#x27;ve gotten a great shave with no cuts even my wife is using them.</li>
    <li> I have more than 35 years shaving and I&#x27;ve tried different kind of razors with different results. When I was invited to use Schick Hydro® 5 Disposables as part of its promotion, I was a bit skeptical but I agreed to participate because this is a Schick product with something innovative.&lt;br /&gt;Razors have a nice handle for giving me the control of my shaving that was smooth and job was made the first time, my skin was not burning after shaving and I am very impressive because I&#x27;ve never had same results before.&lt;br /&gt;The only cons is about the durability if it falls long distant (bathroom sink to the floor) the head razor is coming apart and it&#x27;s hard to fix it as any other disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;SCHICK HYDRO® 5 DISPOSABLES is a good product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro 5 disposable razors free from bzzagent.com. I was a little hesitant at first, but they gave a close comfortable shave. The moisturizer was a little slimy feeling, but the razor felt good in my hand. This is going to be my ne razor.</li>
    <li> I was sent a Schick Hydro 5 package from BzzAgent to try. After trying this razor out for a week I have to say it lacked a key feature that I expect all name brand razors with this many blades to have. It lacked an extra precision blade on the back for trimming my sideburns or around my upper lip. Other than that is was a decent blade but not worth leaving DSC.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as part of a free trial and was excited to give them a try. Boy how I wish they lived up to expectations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the razors out of the pack and liked what I saw. The blades looks great and the two strips for moisturizing looked like they would get the job done. I lathered up my faced and started to shave. The first couple of strokes went off without a hitch but I did notice the head seemed obnoxiously big but something I could work around. After that it all went down hill. As I continued to work on my face I noticed a quite a bit of tug and pull but still felt I was getting a close shave. I finished it all up and took my shower. The shave wasn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve ever had but wasn&#x27;t the worst either. It all went down hill after that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face burnt the rest of that day and into the next. With my next shave I decided to give it ago again and it didn&#x27;t get any better, more tug and pull and more burn. I barely finished my Shave. Also the head is so big its hard to get the hairs right under my nose and was quite frustrating to get all of them.I gave it one more try the next day but couldn&#x27;t finish and switched back to my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was just to big for detail shaving and the burn was more than I could handle after just my 3rd shave. Went back to my cheap 3 blade store brand disposable and felt the shave was closer with less burn. Unless you like a burning face I recommend to stay away.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! I have been using the same disposable razor every day for 5 days straight and have been shaping my in-growing beard with it. It has been smooth, precise, and hasn&#x27;t caused any skin irritation. I highly recommend that everyone tries this razor. Way to go as Schick Hydro 5!</li>
    <li> I received these as part of a promotional campaign. These disposables are so good, they have replaced any need I had for a razor refill.  I have sensitive skin and these left me with no issues afterwards, no knicks, no razor burn. I&#x27;m absolutely amazed at how good a disposable could be. Even my skeptical wife decided to steal one and now she wants her own!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use disposable razers but when I got these I decided to give it a try. So I lathered up and made my face all slick because if I don&#x27;t I get a ton of razer bumps if I don&#x27;t.Well....I was quite pleasantly surprised at the feeling these things give. The little reservoir of gel at the top edge gives these things better glide than any other disposable razer iv&#x27;e used.They also feel awesome in the hand being made out of some plastic and metal combo.I suppose that even if I didn&#x27;t lather up first I would probably still be fine.I really like these and if I ever run out of safety blades I might just keep these in reserve. Thanks #BzzAgent for the samples!!!!!</li>
    <li> Solid razor.  Mousterizer strip lasts longer than other razors and these things stay sharp after daily shaving for several weeks.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as part of the Buzzagent program.  I am totally impressed by the smoothness of the razor. I can&#x27;t  feel the blades slicing my beard and the shave is closer than that of my Gillete Power fusion razor.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro 5 is a disposable razor. It perfect size and fits nicely in your hand. On either side where your fingers grip there are little groves to make sure you get and nice grip on the razor. The razor has 5 blades and a hydrating gel bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SHAVE: Schick Hydro 5 gave me the closest shave! After each stroke of the razor you can feel the slick gel feeling left on the skin from the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this razor has 5 blades, it gets all the hair in one swipe! I received this razor from buzzAgent I would defiantly buy it!</li>
    <li> I always use an electric razor, mainly because I find that non-electric razors tug and pull, and leave my skin red and bumpy. So when I had the chance to try these out through BzzAgent, I was skeptical and a bit disappointed. But I have to admit that I was very pleasantly surprised when I gave them a try. Whether it was the hydrating gel or the multiple blades, these razors left me with a close and comfortable shave, and no red or bumpy skin. So if you are already a user of non-electric razors, or if you use an electric and want to have something as a back-up, I would recommend giving these a chance.</li>
    <li> I got these as part of my initial bzzkit from bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use the Gillette Fusion, so this was my first time trying a disposable razor and my first Schick razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Monday morning, I followed my normal shaving routine - lathered up with Axe shaving cream and proceeded to try out the Schick Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor was very light - a little too light for my taste.  I felt I was having to use my energy to push/pull the razor through my beard versus letting the weight of the razor do the work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the shave, my face felt smooth.  I only had to go over a couple of sections twice. I chalked this up to not being familiar with the razor than due to any quality defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, Monday evening, I could already feel patches of stubble coming back.  I normally don&#x27;t get this with my Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday morning, I repeated my normal process using the initial razor I used Monday.  I wanted to see how many days I could use the same razor so I could judge the financial impact switching to these razors would be in my usage.  I found the razor considerably duller than Monday and I had to repeat sections 2-3 times to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good razor that I could see using if I am on a trip and I forget my normal razor at home.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see this razor being a replacement for my normal razor.</li>
    <li> I agree with those who say the 5 blades are overkill, but what I think merits a bad rating is the FALSE ADVERTISING--packaging intended to deceive. It says \\&quot;5 Disposables,\\&quot; when in fact there are only 3. The number \\&quot;3\\&quot; appears in smaller print at lower left, but the big number \\&quot;5\\&quot; would lead many to believe it is the number of razors, not simply the number of blades on each razor. It says \\&quot;5 Disposables.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to be a good consumer, which means supporting good companies and not patronizing companies with deceptive advertising. I will never buy another Schick product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize the Amazon headline says \\&quot;3 count\\&quot; but it&#x27;s the packaging I&#x27;m talking about. When you&#x27;re in a store grabbing more razors, Schick wants you to glance at that big \\&quot;5 Disposables\\&quot; and think you&#x27;re getting 5 instead of 3. And they make it hard for you to see into the package, so you don&#x27;t readily notice how many are in there.</li>
    <li> Feels amazing - no razor burn on my neck</li>
    <li> Best disposable I&#x27;ve used in a long time. I usually just buy the store brand but this pivoting head and the five blades makes for a smooth and pain free shave.  And they were cheaper than what I can find in the local stores.</li>
    <li> These give a very close shave... and after i am feeling cool and soft with no abrasiveness. flip and trim is great for those sideburns. As far as disposable razors go, these are probably the best i&#x27;ve used. with the type of facial hair i have, i can probably use 1 razor for 2 weeks. they&#x27;re sharp and absolutely live up to my expectations</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and I received these for free to tryout and review. I was very skeptical if a disposable razor that would perform as well if not better than the others. I have been a member of the big national subscription razor brand. But I think that these Schick Hydro 5 Disposable razor have out performed them. I really like how close of a shave I have achieved with them. Also the hydrating gel feels really good too! #BzzAgent #GotitFree #SchickHydro5</li>
    <li> I used to stick to the traditional refill handle from another company, but decided to try these as a potential replacement due to refill prices becoming outrageous.  I am glad I did because these gave me a very close shave with only one pass and are so much more continent then the refills.  The hydrating gel leaves my skin feeling nice after shaving and the trimming blade is perfect for my sideburns and any neck hair that gets out of control.  I used to only buy disposables for travel because I always thought they could never be as nice as my refills, but I am going to keep some in my bathroom from now on with the features these razors have.</li>
    <li> I have really been enjoying the Schick Hydro 5 disposable razor.  It gives a clean quick shave with little irritation.  There is a good amount of lubricant in the strips and that really helps minimize irritation.  Highly recommended if you have sensitive skin and still need a close shave!  I got this razor as part of a promotion from Schick but this does beat any disposable razor I have used before.  I will purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use disposables often but I would use these again... not all the time but mostly for travel. They give a clean smooth shave with having 5 razors but it&#x27;s just not the same as a reuseable.</li>
    <li> Baby smoothe shave with little to no razor burn on a person with sensitive skin. Highly recommend to others to give a try!</li>
    <li> I received these razors through BzzAgent and gave them a try.  I typically shave with an old 3 blade replaceable razor, so these were a bit of a change.  I have never opted for the &amp;#34;blade war&amp;#34; razors.  I found they clog up and don&#x27;t feel any different, but these razors were very enjoyable.  The way the razor head opens up made for easy rinses and the razor really didn&#x27;t have a clogging issue for me.  The Hydo part of these razors were great,  the water activated strip made for a really comfortable shave with very little irritation.  The product dose feel a bit cheep in your hand but it is a disposable razor and I felt the function far out weighed the feel.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars was I felt that the shave could have been closer but over all great performance, great after feel, a solid razor.  Thanks BzzAgent for introducing me to this product I would buy next time.</li>
    <li> Great razor! I received these free to try out, and I have to say they give me an excellent shave! my only complaint  would be that the head is almost to big and is a tiny bit difficult when using to shave a goatee. I still managed to though and that is a minor gripe.</li>
    <li> Great shaver in so many ways. I love the design &amp; the blades. This shaver leaves no razor bumps nor cuts you up. Definitely a must have :)</li>
    <li> Overall the razors are wonderful.  The hydration gel is soothing and there is plenty of it.  I didn&#x27;t get a close shave as much as I would&#x27;ve like but still overall they are a good product.  Comfortable handle and the best part to me was the fact that the blades don&#x27;t get clogged with hair.  They just rinse off with ease.  I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I regularly shave with a Gillette Mach 3.  Disposable razors are usually a little harsh on my face.  However, the first time I used the Schick Hydro 5 disposable was a very pleasant experience.  The right side of my neck is usually a difficult place to get a clean shave, but this razor did the job in only a couple of swipes.  There is so much moisturizer on these razors that it actually feels a little slimy, but I was able to do my whole face with no razor burn.  The flip trimmer came in handy around the base of my nose.  I used this razor again two days later and it shaved just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor blades are very expensive, so I usually only change out my regular blade once every couple of months.  I get the feeling that I would be able to use one of these razors for the same amount of time without a problem.  I like them so much, I&#x27;m willing to try.</li>
    <li> PROS: I received some samples of the razors during a promotion and I was surprised.This razor is surprisingly smooth. I moved away form multi-blade razors because of the irritation and tugging I was experiencing, but this razor did not give me any problems. I only use disposables when I travel and I&#x27;ve been trying to find one to stick to. This may be the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It is difficult to clean between strokes (as are all multi-blade razors I&#x27;ve tried). It sometimes needs a few seconds of shaking and rinsing. Also, it is fairly lightweight. That can be a good or bad thing depending on the person, but I prefer a little bit of weight on my razor.</li>
    <li> Pulled out the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable razors provided by BzzAgent to clean up a couple days of growth before the Super Bowl.  Overall, the shave was about what I expected. I do not use disposable razors often, but this will probably make it into my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;Close Shave w/ no cuts&lt;br /&gt;Less passes over the same area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of razor burn in a few areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh:&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating gel - this was okay, but I could take it or leave it.  I didn&#x27;t really notice it when shaving.  I did notice a bit more when rinsing my face.&lt;br /&gt;Flip-up Trimmer - I guess if you have some areas on the face that are tougher to get to, it could be helpful especially since having 5 blades makes the actual razor a bit large.  However, I didn&#x27;t find myself needing to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Disposable - I could see this great for travel, but just being called disposable makes it feel like I am adding to our landfills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I would use these razors when travelling or if I forgot my handle and blades on the road, but they probably won&#x27;t become my everyday razor.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro disposable razors are great. I love them. They give a good, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought i would get such a good shave from a disposable, but these are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only disposables i will buy from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these razors.&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
    <li> This disposable has exceeded my expectation for a disposable razor. It&#x27;s as good as non disposable razor. It&#x27;s easy on the skin and doesn&#x27;t tear the face up like a lot of disposable razor tend to do. It&#x27;s smooth and leaves you with a close shave. Great quality. Got it free to review from BzzAgent</li>
    <li> I received a three pack of  Schick Hydro 5 Disposables Razors from BZZagent.com. I usually do not use disposables as I am not happy with the quality of the razor as well as the shaving experience. These are great! A nice clean smooth shave every time and can be used over again. Very pleased and will be purchasing more of these!</li>
    <li> I received this Razor as a test product from # BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;The razor with its 5 blades and hydrating gel performed smoothly i have sensitive skin and prone to razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;with this razor i received a really close shave without repeating and NO RAZOR BURN!&lt;br /&gt;The silicone handle was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 5 out of 5 stars!</li>
    <li> *Product provided for free via BzzAgent -  Review is however all mine*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have maintained a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow for a couple years now, mainly because of sensitive skin. I was interested, however hesitant, to try the new Schick Hydro 5 blade because I figured blade technology must have improved over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was right. After making my first shaving cream purchase in years, I lathered up and began cleaning up any trace of facial hair. The blades cut the hair without hesitation and without nicks or cuts. The five blades effortlessly glided around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finishing the task, I rinsed off and no red skin. For me, that is really amazing. The blade worked great and without any irritation. Sign me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only difficulty now is getting adjusted to a baby face and new hair growing in, which causes it to be itchy. That will pass in time.</li>
    <li> Schick Hydro 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Schick Hydro 5 through a promotion on BzzAgent and while it gave me a good shave,&lt;br /&gt;I must say it did not give me a GREAT shave. I had been shaving with a new Norelco shaver&lt;br /&gt;and a Gillette ProGlide razor (with the vibrating mechanism) and I have to say I got a smoother&lt;br /&gt; shave with both the Gillette razor and the electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving with the Schick I could still feel some stubble when I would rub my hand against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice the added hydration in the Schick.  Although the trimmer feature is a nice idea,&lt;br /&gt;it seemed a little dangerous, although that might just be MY reaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who doesn&#x27;t like to shave more than once a week so my face is a thick stubble when I shave. The space between each blade is large enough that the hairs don&#x27;t clump and get stuck like cheap razors do. The multiples blades will make shaving quick and easy. It took me less than 3 minutes to shave my entire face. My face doesn&#x27;t get irritated or burn afterwords and I have yet to cut myself. The handle is easy to grip even when wet and the gel keeps your face moisturized. Overall, these are great razors and will last you a lot longer than those cheap razors.</li>
    <li> Good price and the handles are amazing!</li>
    <li> These razors are absolutely perfect for staying over my girlfriend&#x27;s house or going on vacation.  They provide a great shave and the razors even last longer than you would imagine.  So far I have been able to get 5 good shaves out of this razor and I just started on my first one 2 weeks ago.</li>
    <li> So I got the opportunity to try these for FREE as a BzzAgent, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a tough time with this rating. 2? Should be more. 3? Maybe. 4? Hmmm. 5? Not this time. Let&#x27;s break it down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I would have based my rating on marketing ploy alone, I would have gone with 2 stars because the packaging is misleading to any right-brain person and to 50% of the left-brainers out there. There is a big &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; splashed on the package with the word &amp;#34;disposables&amp;#34; -- in two languages so that you can get fooled into thinking that you are getting 5 razors in both English and in French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To go to the other side of the spectrum, let&#x27;s discuss why this should be 4 stars (5 stars being ruled out due to the surprise that most will feel after getting home and opening their 3 pack of razors and then wondering how in the world did either Fido or Mittens make off with the other 2 razors). 4 stars. It has weight. Unlike the actual razor, though, but wait. I did get a pretty smooth shave-even in those areas where your face is more like a petrified forest refusing to be cut down and laid barren. My first use with the blade was like this. The second and subsequent times I wielded the same stone cutting blade, a few tiny petrified saplings remained, but I had to use the tip of my most delicate finger to trace out their roots. Not bad. Indeed. And if you&#x27;ve ever cut timber with a blade, you&#x27;ll concur that sometimes getting that sawdust stubble out of your blades can be frustrating, sometimes even forcing you to bang your blade on the edge of your sink like Thor pounding his hammer. Not so with this razor. That&#x27;s a good thing, as sinks are expensive to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to round it all out. I would have loved to have a 1/2 star option on this one because I was in between the &amp;#34;middle&amp;#34; ground of the 3 and the &amp;#34;almost hallowed&amp;#34; ground of the 4. But like salaries and employee rankings, I personally like to be rounded up, so I paid this one forward...barely. Why? Outside of the misleading packaging, I get up, shower, shave, rotate with the kids&#x27; carpool, go to work. Yes, that is the essence of many a routine. But how much different could my day be, if when I shave (the most manly part of my morning, as I&#x27;m working a razor blade across my face!), I went on an adventure? How about picking up a chrome/steel/gray color handled blade and prepping myself to go save the planet on a mission to Mars? Or how about grabbing my Hulk green razor and prepping for my day as a superhero? Instead I got this fairly lightweight, nearly baby blue handled razor to wield like the man I dream of being. Call me what you like, but I want my razor to look the part. Just because I&#x27;ve traded my convertible for a kid-hauler doesn&#x27;t mean that I want to be whisked away to the spa when I&#x27;m shaving. If I go to the spa, it&#x27;s to get a massage to repair my broken body from all that superheroing I do all day. So yes, even my razor should take me on an adventure, and if not an adventure, I will gladly take a quest. This razor has potential, and at the end of the day, maybe that&#x27;s all we need.paid this one forward...barely. Why?

    <li> So I received the razor or free as part of a promotion.  I was a little skeptical because I am not usually a fan of disposable razors.  With that in mind I was pleasantly surprised. As far as disposable razors go this one is pretty good.  They don&#x27;t feel as cheap as some other disposables.  They have a pretty good weight and good feel to them.  Overall the shave is pretty good.  I would say if you are going to buy a disposable raxor that this is a good option.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try these via Bzzagent campaign and I was VERY impressed.  They work just like the cartridges you purchase for your razor.  They are way worth the price and without a doubt they last just as long... If you are looking for a disposable that works like a more expensive razor but has the price of normal disposables (or a TINY bit more) then these are for you...</li>
    <li> For a disposable razor the Shhick Hydro 5 is one of the best I have tried.  received these razors as a campaign from bzzagent and Schick! These razors are amazing! They give you an awesome close shave while making your skin feel soooo soft! I absolutely love the 5 blades! It sure does a great job at removing the hair! I definitely recommend buying these razors!</li>
    <li> I received a free package from Bzzagent. I have been very impressed with the razors. I get multiple shaves with each one, my skin is smooth after each shave, and I no longer have issues with razor burn.</li>
    <li> Shaves just as well as a &amp;#34;regular razor.  Great close shave with this disposable razor.  I am glad they come in packs of three instead as a single unit.  The cap on the end protects the blades in your toiletry bag.  Great close smooth shave.  Great bargain for the price.</li>
    <li> After receiving this product as part of a promotion from the brand, I found 5 awesome benefits that seperate it from the competition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Close shave -- didn&#x27;t require going over my face a 2nd time (which is usually the case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) No wasted shaving cream -- I never know how much to use, but the Reservoir does the work for you!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) No 5:00 shadow -- I have a 5 month-old baby girl at home and I can cuddle her in the evenings without worrying about my stubble scratching her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) No skin irritation -- I shave every day before work and by the end of the week my skin is usually very irritated... Not Anymore! The shave oils make a Hugh difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) No more uneven sideburns -- I shave in the shower and the flip trimmer allows me to ensure even and crisp looking sideburns.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Gives you a close shave and  I received the product to review for free! Made me change from the razor I was using to this brand,</li>
    <li> Got these for free as part of a BzzAgent.com campaign; it&#x27;s a high quality razor, especially for being a disposable. There are a few issues which are what I will start off with, but they are very minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the gel reservoir thing that&#x27;s supposed to moisturize your face.. Doesn&#x27;t actually do anything except for make it a nice, comfortable shave. Hardly a real negative but I do feel like it&#x27;s important to bring up. The razor is also very light and feels like hollow plastic, giving it a cheap feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, these razors ARE cheap so a cheap feel isn&#x27;t necessarily all that bad. The handle is comfortable and easy to hold and the shave is very close and feels excellent. I have a relatively small amount of facial hair but it&#x27;s worth mentioning that it only takes one stroke to remove pretty much all of the hair. Super fast and feels great; if they find a way to weight it a little bit I&#x27;d absolutely give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great grip.  Wasn&#x27;t impressed with the sharpness of the blades but it gets the job done.  Sometimes I feel like that I am not shaving close enough.  Gave a pair to a female friend who wanted to try. She really enjoyed them.  No reported bumps.  Great value for a disposable razors.</li>
    <li> very good disposable razor. gets your face extra smooth. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.. you must buy this and try it for your self</li>
    <li> Recieved this product as a sample from Bzzagent.  I am glad I was given Shrick hydro 5 to try.  I am happy I tried it.  My spouse and I use it for every shave.  I am sticking to this product from now on.</li>
    <li> Most of the time I shave with an electric razor...Because blade razors cut and nick my face.....But since I got the Schick Hydro free from BzzAgent.....I gave them a try....To my surprise very smooth on the face...And one blade lasted me over two weeks of daily shaving...Not a bad razor at all</li>
    <li> Having just got this from BzzAgent for free, my expectations weren&#x27;t that high.  I&#x27;ve used the standard disposables from Bic and Gillette before, and found that they just really shredded my face.  Even the standard Schick didn&#x27;t impress me that much.  I travel a lot for work, and at the same time try to travel as light as possible so that means no electric, and no shaving cream since I try to stick to carry on.  So generally I shave after the shower with just some soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this with my normal routine, and I have to say I was impressed.  The shave was close, didn&#x27;t chew me up or get hung up and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  So whatever they&#x27;re using for the HYDRO is really easy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a disposable, I haven&#x27;t come across one this good before, and would put it up there with a regular cartridge razor too.  As a bonus, it doesn&#x27;t look like a throw away, unless you turn it over.</li>
    <li> After receiving my disposable razors from bzzagent.com, I went to work on my woodsman beard. I have used many different brands, and all I can say is WOW. My face has never been so smooth with the least amount of effort.</li>
    <li> I received 3 of these as a bzzzagent package for trial and I am impressed with the fact that I have used it for a week now and it still has the slick fury thing that keeps the shaving smooth. I am used to fusion, which does not keep that for more than 3 or 4 shavings.  Hydro 5 disposable is provides a close shave,the only issue is shaving close to your nose,because you cannot reach and shave close to it. It is actually a problem with aloof these 4 and 5 blades products. Another brand has a single blade on the back to address this issue</li>
    <li> I actually belong to the Dollar Shave Club and these razors are just as good even thought they are disposables. Clean, smooth, and very close shave. I will definitely pick up a few packs of these.</li>
    <li> I typically only use an electric razor on my face and neck because of my sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m so glad to have found the Schick Hydro 5 because I had no irritation whatsoever. Closest, cleanest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time! Great product.</li>
    <li> I received these as a trial through BZZAGENT. These are definitely the closest that a disposable has come for me to being an extension of my hand. I normally do not use disposables, but there are times where a good disposable would be convenient. For instance, I also shave with double-edge razors, and I lost one of my better ones traveling. These could serve as an excellent shaving traveling companion, one that is replaceable, yet reliable and consistent as well. The major drawback to any “modern” cartridge razor is the competition to see who can add the most blades. For me, the more blades crossing my skin, the worse the irritation. With a double-edge or straight razor, you can control what the ONE blade is doing, and it is easier to be on top of blade quality to fit your specific needs. With cartridge-multi-blade razors, it is not guaranteed as to how many days you will get out of each razor. In the case of these Schick Hydro 5 disposables, they on day two I was already experiencing burn from all 5 blades crossing my face, a burn that I do not get with less blades. These are WAY less harsh on your face than competitor’s blades though, which is a plus. They are more comfortable to use at first then a cheaper disposable, but it may not make them such an economical choice if they do not last. I will keep trying my first one until I cannot tolerate it, and I will try different products with it as well. I did get nicked on shave two, which has not happened in a while. But again, The competitor’s multi-blade razor always nicks me every time!</li>
    <li> solid razor.  I use it for traveling and it gets the job done.  clean and smooth for the most part.  decent handle for a disposable, easy to grip when wet.</li>
    <li> Things that are the most important to me in a razor in order of importance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***  Closeness&lt;br /&gt;***  Quickness&lt;br /&gt;*****  Comfort&lt;br /&gt;???? Economical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt;If you are not in a hurry, want to travel light, and care more about comfort than speed and efficiency when shaving with the Hydro might be for you, it was probably the most comfortable disposable I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions that still need to be answered&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Hydration Bar - Comfortable, but can I get Closeness and Quickness?&lt;br /&gt;Since my beard is so fine the hydration bar might be working against the razor here, next shave I am going to use no water ( OUCH ) and see if the razor performs better, and if that doesn&#x27;t work then I will use the hydration bar on the last pass only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Economy&lt;br /&gt;I have to wait and see how long the razor lasts before I can answer this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Testing Methodology&lt;br /&gt;I tested this razor against a Gillette 3 blade disposable razor that I currently use, it has no hydration and is pretty cheap, I didn&#x27;t shave for two days, and I only used water on my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the Hydro on the left, and the Gillette on the right, I did one pass per side and then compared, repeating until I felt I couldn&#x27;t do any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness&lt;br /&gt;The hydro felt so smooth and comfortable that I thought for sure that it would win this test, it seemed to cut like a hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette in comparison felt like it was skipping and pulling at my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finished pass one though the Hydro had left a LOT more of my beard on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason ( I think, test two will confirm ) is that the Hydration actually worked against the Hydro, it lubed my whiskers so well that some of them were lying flat and the blade just skipped over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face and flicked the hydration bar out of the way, once that was accomplished I did more passes until both sides were as clean as I could get them and I have to say the Gillette still edged out the Hydro, I want to try this again without the Hydration bar and switch face sides before I pass a final judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quickness&lt;br /&gt;If you use the Hydro bar right out of the gate compared to a none hydrating razor it&#x27;s going to take longer if your beard lays down like mine did&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite a bit longer since I had to clean my face for the final pass to get all the stubble off, in general the Hydration worked TOO WELL!  In fairness my beard is fairly fine, and if your is stiff you might not have the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor loading and cleaning between passes seemed about the same, I need to retest to be sure though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort&lt;br /&gt;If you use the hydration bar the Hydro wins hands down, extremely comfortable shave even just using water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economical&lt;br /&gt;More testing is needed, I am using the same two razors and will continue to test one against the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically by shave 3-4 the Gillette becomes too dull to continue to use, and by shave 5 I toss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to run each blade to exhaustion to see how they compare cost wise.es until both sides were as clean as I could get them and I have to say the Gillette still edged out the Hydro, I want to try this again without the Hydration bar and switch face sides before I pass a final judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quickness&lt;br /&gt;If you use the Hydro bar right out of the gate compared to a none hydrating razor it&#x27;s going to take longer if your beard lays down like mine did&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite a bit longer since I had to clean my face for the final pass to get all the stubble off, in general the Hydration worked TOO WELL!

    <li> I received the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor to try as part of a Bzz Campaign.  I really love the fact that it does what the name says -hydrates.  I have sensitive skin so this is a real plus in my book.  No irritated, red skin-just a clean, smooth shave.  The fact that it has 5 blades speaks volumes on what a close shave you get.  I didn&#x27;t have to go over my face twice which I often have to do with other razors.  And the flip trimmer makes getting around certain areas a piece of cake.  And the handle gripped nicely in my hand so there was no slipping.  A great shave and a great product!</li>
    <li> This is for my husband that don&#x27;t write on the internet ! He said one swipe and you get smooth , two swipes and water gives you a baby&#x27;s bottom.  This razor takes little effort on like others that takes lots of work to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> I got these Schick Hydro 5 disposables free through BzzAgent. Let me start by saying it doesn&#x27;t really feel like you&#x27;re shaving. These things literally glide right over your skin. Ladies, my wife used one on her legs and said it was the best disposable she&#x27;d ever used. (even easy on the knees) I loved everything about these razors. The hydrating gel is awesome. There is no dragging feeling and it just smooth all the way around. They have a soft grippy handle so no accidental dropping. The flip trimmer allows for easier shaving of your underparts. Highly recommend these razors.</li>
    <li> I received my Shick Hydro 5 Disposables as a free trial from BzzAgent. When I received them I immediately liked the packaging, was simple and easy to gain access too by just peeling back the corner, no cutting away half the package with scissors to gain access like other brands. The handle is comfortable and easy to grip and the head has a nice range of pivot, it will actually turn 90 degrees to the handle for a nice full range of motion when shaving. But other than that I was disappointed, on my head it was useless and would not shave unless I applied a bunch of force to the razor. On my face and neck it did somewhat better but the head liked to clog up with shaving soap and was difficult to clean to continue shaving. I didn&#x27;t seem to notice any aloe or moisturizing feeling on my skin either, and it gave an okay shave when it worked but not worth using or the cost in my opinion</li>
    <li> Got A Pack of Shick Hydro 5 Disposble razors from Schick to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the pack the razors felt pretty high quality for disposables. The grip is comfortable and the head moves nicely. Definitely a higher quality razor than I&#x27;m used to with toss away disposables. The Hydrating Gel Reservoir does provide extra lubrication and again is above par for disposables. The 5 \\&quot;Ultra Glide\\&quot; blades cut through my 3 day scruff very smoothly, and very close. I did try the flip trimmer (basically the Hydrating Gel Reservoir on top flips back so you can cut a clean line with the razor) and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am pretty impressed for disposables.</li>
    <li> I am accustomed to using the cheapest disposable razors.  Single blades or double blade razors are what I usually use.  I recently tried the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable as provided to me as a BZZ Agent.  The difference is immediately recognizable!  First off, I want to note the closeness of the shave.  Using cheaper disposable razors, I would shave and then have to shave again 2 days later.  Using the Schick Hydro 5, I was able to go 3-4 days.  The shave was very close and comfortable, no skin pulling or cuts.  The gel on the razor keeps the unit flowing smoothly on your skin.  I must say that I am very inpressed with these razors and am very happy to switch.</li>
    <li> After getting my test kit of Shick Hydro 5 razors from BzzAgent, I decided to put them to a real test and let my facial hair build up for a couple of solid weeks before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor passed the test brilliantly, I was impressed with how efficiently the razor worked, and the complete lack of irritation and/or razor burn I had afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors themselves feel huge compared to most disposables on the market, they have some real weight to them. The gel part isnt messy, and it helps the entire shaving process go smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to come up with a negative side, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend dropping them, the head comes off with ease (to be fair, it&#x27;s easily reassembled, but still bears mentioning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definately love these razors! #GotItFree</li>
    <li> Best disposable razer I&#x27;ve used. Between the 5 blades and pop up trimmer they have become a welcome addition to my morning routine.</li>
    <li> After a couple of shaves I have grown to love this razor. Shaves close without any cuts and nicks.  On top of this is rare for any razor to leave a razor burn and this tops them all as this razor did not leave any razor burns.  With the built-in gel reservoir it keeps your skin hydrated and allows for an easier shave.  Also with the 5 blades it allows you to shave in less time as it helps to shave quicker and don&#x27;t have to go back and shave back over the same area.  The only Con on these razors is the price but for the quality you get out of them it&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bzzagent and Schick for the free razors and one of the best experiences I have had with any best razor!</li>
    <li> Smooth,nick free shave! My husband and I both enjoyed using the Schick Hydro 5.. It left me with a smooth, stub free shave. My skin felt wonderful. My hubby shaves his head bald.. He too, thought the razor left him stubble free. No nicks, smooth and hydrated. I love that they are disposable. Great product, we will definitely purchase these. I received a sample free from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> This razor looks and is packaged like most premium razors however preforms horribly. I have used single blade disposable razors that perform just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razors gets hung up a lot as if it is extremely dull.  There is no closeness of shave. After multiple passes on the same area I decided to test a standard single blade disposable and found it indeed created a closer, smoother shave. The moister pads simply do not work. This is far inferior of Gillette products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I have shaved with the Schick Hydro 5 Disposables 3 times now after I received it for free from BzzAgent. I usually shave with my electric rotary razor so it took a couple of shaves to get my technique right with this new razor. I started by washing my face off and rinsed it with warm water to prepare my face and facial hair. I applied shaving cream and waited for a minute or so before starting. I shave with the grain first then against on my second pass. This razor is comfortable to hold and fits well in your hand. The head has great movement so you can really get close around the contours of your face. I did have to go over a few spots more than once because the blade did not cut close enough. Comparing this razor to other razors I have used similar to it that are NOT disposable, I would say the Schick Hydro 5 holds its own and was actually slightly better than others I have used. After shaving on my 3rd try, I did not have the burning sensation of razor burn that I usually experience after shaving with a blade. This may be in part due to the Aloe lotion that is on the head of the razor. This really did seem to hydrate my face as I shaved and made it easier to go back over the parts I missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this razor 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I got these for free via bzzagent. I usually keep pretty beardy, but when I do shave I&#x27;ve stuck to my safety razor. These are a wonderful departure. Got a close shave in one pass and it was pretty comfortable. The down side of 5 blades is trying to clean the gunck out between strokes.</li>
    <li> I like these razors quite a bit! Overall the quality of the handle and razor made me think these weren&#x27;t actually disposable. Coming from a Gillette fusion pro glide I actually like the shave of these better for a couple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;Reason number 1&lt;br /&gt;I thought the shave smoothness was superior to my other shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Reason number 2&lt;br /&gt;The hydrating gel guard really made the shave feel less irritable as well as creating a good barrier for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also lasted a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy these again especially for the price they do a very good job.</li>
    <li> I received my Schick Hydro 5 Disposable razors as a sample from Schick &amp; BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have been very skeptical about disposables and have always used their non-disposable counterpart.  I have been very pleased and satisfied with the quality of shave I have received the the Schick Hydro 5.  Not only do I get an exceptionally smooth shave, but it is as close as other products I&#x27;ve used and I have not experienced any razor burn whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydrating Gel Reservoir helps to allow the razor to glide across my face and the Aloe and Vitamin E are helping my skin feel soft and healthy looking. #FreeYourSkin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a great razor and goof value.  I was able to get 7 shaves out of one disposable so far and it still feels good after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to try these.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am not a typical Disposable Razor guy but I received a pack of these to try out. The shave its self was a great experience especially compared to a disposable razor, it compares closer to a reusable razor. I have used the shick quatro for years and this falls in line with that, I will use these when i am looking for a disposable razor on vacation.</li>
    <li> I just finished my 3rd disposable Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;I love them all. The cut are nice and smooth for every shave.&lt;br /&gt;I could do it with and without shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as a campaign from bzzagent and Schick! These razors are amazing! They give you an awesome close shave while making your skin feel soooo soft! I absolutely love the 5 blades! It sure does a great job at removing the hair! I definitely recommend buying these razors!</li>
    <li> I received a sample pack from Shick and BzzAgent so I figured I&#x27;d give these razors a go! My skin is fairly sensitive when it comes to shaving and I almost always end up with razor bumps and irritated skin, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve shaved with a disposable razor and NOT had to deal with a weeks worth of ingrown hairs and burning razor bumps. So I have to salute Shick on adding some quality aloe vera and vitamin E. Good job guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me personally, the five blades has done a much better job than three blades or less to smooth out the skin and it feels like there is less snagging/hair pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexibility of the blade is pretty spot on when shaving around the chin, the jawline and the nose areas, so I was pretty impressed for a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle as a whole is pretty lightweight, so it&#x27;s easy to hold and I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to death grip it while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d get these again and I&#x27;d recommend them for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Got a free sample of these razors the other day. I&#x27;ve used them twice, not a bad shave. Wife likes the closeness.</li>
    <li> I got this free through BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve used other brands of 5 blade razors in the past and found this one to be pretty average when compared to the rest. Truthfully it doesn&#x27;t seem to perform any better or worse than others. One thing I did like was the fact that it felt a bit lighter and easier to maneuver in my hand while shaving. I didn&#x27;t notice thy hydrating gel really doing much of anything but I&#x27;ve found that to be the case with all non-electric razors I&#x27;ve used in the past. All in all it&#x27;s not a bad product and certainly delivered a smooth easy shave but I would expect that to be the case. This razor doesn&#x27;t really distinguish itself from it&#x27;s competitors but is certainly a perfectly adequate shaving solution. I would absolutely pick this disposable over the single blade disposables that are available.</li>
    <li> I received this from a Bzzagent campaign and I was not overly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Comfortable grip/handle&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturized my face and didn&#x27;t leave it dry like other razors&lt;br /&gt;-Stylish design/ packaging&lt;br /&gt;-Close enough shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Blades only shave comfortably for three or four shaves&lt;br /&gt;-Large razor head makes it hard to maneuver for trimming around nose and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;-I cut myself with this razor.  I very rarely cut myself while shaving.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice disposable razor, I myself don&#x27;t like disposables all that much but, this disposable is probably on the better end of the cheap razor spectrum, it&#x27;s a smooth shave after two or three uses, and it gets the job done. Other than that I&#x27;ll still stick with my Gillette ProGlide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this as a part of a promotional panel from Schick.</li>
    <li> I would like to preface my review by stating that I am a diehard user of safety razors in conjunction with a tried-and-true badger brush and shave soap. Further, my review is based on a sample I received from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have grown accustomed to shaving with a safety razor over the years. Before I hopped on the safety razor bandwagon, I used to shave with whatever was cheapest: Bic, Gillete, Schick, etc. Thus, I will primarily focus on comparing the Hydro 5 to my previous experiences with disposables. I will note that I used my Hydro 5 with my brush and shave soap, so my experiences may differ from those of other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What initially stands out to me is the Hydro 5&#x27;s lubrication strip and trimmer. When compared to other disposables, the Hydro 5 provides a smoother shave, with very little irritation (if any). The Hydro 5 was able to cut through light to moderate stubble with ease and without any cuts. Further, the Hydro 5 was able to function with fewer strokes when compared to other disposables. Realistically, it does not compete with the effectiveness of my safety razor. But, my safety razor cost $100 whereas the Hydro 5 can be easily obtained for a tenth of that price.&lt;br /&gt;The flip trimmer is a nice touch and not a feature one typically associates with disposable razors. I can contour and trim my sideburns with ease. It adds a level of precision I have only been able to achieve with my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another highlight of the Hydro 5 is the sharpness and quality of the blades. I have used my razor several times since I received my sample pack (roughly 2-3 times a week) and the blades still cut as good as when I opened the package. Historically, my experiences with disposable razors have not been this positive; specifically, the blades would dull rather quickly and eventually result in irritation or cuts. I would rate the cut of the blades/quality of the shave as infinitely better than other disposables, but below my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, in comparison to other disposables, the Hydro 5 is outstanding, especially at this price point. The resulting shave is quick, smooth and free of irritation. The flip trimmer enables one to contour their beard or trim their sideburns effortlessly, while the gel strip soothes and comforts the skin. I wouldn&#x27;t give up my safety razor for the Hydro 5 for home use, but in a pinch or when travelling I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase the Hydro 5.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro 5 disposable razor as part of a BzzAgent campaing - this is a really solid disposable razor - the key being disposable. All the comforts of a disposable (lightweight, compact), but with the benefits of five blades, like your cartridge razor (those replaceable ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately impressed by the ease at which I was able to glide this razor across my face. While that sounds ridiculous - isn&#x27;t that what you want from a razor? A smooth and effortless shave? What is also pleasantly surprising is the hydrating gel reservoir. it really does its job - but I did notice it can be a little tricky washing the gel off after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to try a new disposable razor, or someone looking to supplement their regular electric shaving with a razor blade.</li>
    <li> the razor came in a nicely packaged plastic cover box,it was very easy to open the box and get to the razor,on first glance the razor looks clean and nicely shaped it is pretty light and has a lot of blades on it (5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i started my shave of first by taking a shower and getting my skin moisturized and ready for a shave i use a pre-shave cream since my skin is very sensitive to razor burn,and also when i apply my lather to my face i use oil in the lather aka shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;the razors did short work of my face hair.&lt;br /&gt;at the end got cloged up a bit but with a little water no issue ,finished of my shave and was very happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then the next day i woke up ,my face looked clean but i had razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;i think it might be the angle of the blades or to many blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but overall i was happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much for letting me use your product.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of these razors through BzzAgent. This is a very high quality disposable razor. Though it is more expensive than others, the quality of each shave is worth it! The hydrating gel facilitates a smooth shave and leaves your skin feeling smooth and well nourished. The razor fits comfortably in your hand. I used this razor every day for a week before I noticed that it was time to replace.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great razor, better then most I have tried! Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Did a good job nice close shave I would recommend someone to try it</li>
    <li> Got these free from BzzAgent and they worked very nice. Close shave and like the gel built-in.</li>
    <li> I have been using these razors for most of the past 6 months.  I like that these razors provide a close shave and keep a sharp edge for a long time.  Shaving daily, I could use one for about 2 months before needing to change razors.  I have used Gillette razors previously, but the price for the Schick razors are much more affordable.  The biggest difference between the Schick Hydro 5 razor and the Gillette Fusion razor would be the single blade trimming blade on the back of the Fusion while the lubricating strip on the Schick blades flips back to give you a more precise placement of the start of your cut.  The Schick Hydro 5 disposable is just as good if not better than any refillable razor.  It has a comfortable handle and the pivoting head keeps the blade at the right angle for shaving close, especially around the chin and neck areas.  The lubricant strip seems to work well to keep the razor moving smoothly over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these razors to anyone looking for a quality razor at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free package of razors from BzzAgent for trial.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve chosen to use these as the razors I use when I&#x27;m on the road, which is quite frequent. They are compact, light, and easy to throw in your bag. They don&#x27;t give me razor burn at all thus far, which I tend to get regularly. And the best part is that my shave is really close. So far I am loving these things. I am hoping that they will last a long time before I have to actually disposing of one!</li>
    <li> These things are awesome!! I dont know why people wouldn&#x27;t buy these! I got them in a free promo and have to say they are amazing!! 5 stars for sure!</li>
    <li> These are absolutely some of the best blades I have ever used. I received a pack to review, and the flexibility of the razors plus the safe close shave I get every time make these blades an incredible value. They keep me from getting cut and give a great shave - I am thoroughly impressed!</li>
    <li> It has a gazillion blades, smooth surface, swivel head, alien design handle and all the stuff to appeal to manly men. But, precise it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Got these for free on BzzAgent and didn&#x27;t expect to notice a difference.  But I did to my surprise.  Very smooth shave, no pull or tug.  Quicker and less irritating shave than my gillette blades.  Would purchase after these run out</li>
    <li> It has been years since my last - mostly unpleasant - encounter with disposable razors - a not-very close shave with lots of nicks and scratches. So it was indeed a pleasant surprise to get a close, comfortable shave with the Schick Hydro-5. I&#x27;m not sure I would toss my usual razor, but at a third of the cost, the Schick is certainly an attractive alternative, and I will probably buy it for travel. It comes with a convenient travel cap that slips on and off for protection, but without a travel case, which would be a nice amenity; in a pinch, however, it would easily fit in a small plastic kitchen bag. I could also see stocking it in a guest room for the convenience of overnight visitors. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it&#x27;s seems sturdy enough that I can imagine each one would be good for several shaves. I should think the 3-pack would last through most vacations, and one less thing to carry home. All in all, I can heartily recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First impression of these is pretty good. smooth soon. Nice finish. We&#x27;ll see how they work after a few uses.  I typically don&#x27;t buy disposable razors because they don&#x27;t last very long. I like this brand and find that their non disposables are really good...</li>
    <li> Clean, smooth shave, no irritation.</li>
    <li> I received a pack of these razors as part of a promotion for the brand. My first impression when I opened that packet and felt the razor was how loose the head felt on it (besides the cheap, light feel of the razor itself but its a disposable so that was expected). When I shaved with it the first time the loose head really bothered me. I ended up having to hold the razor perpendicular to my face just to keep the blades on my skin. Very awkward and uncomfortable. The shave itself? Nick city. My face and neck looked like I tried to use a straight razor blindfolded. Same with my second shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this though, the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was when I used it to shave myself \\&quot;down there\\&quot; in the shower it actually performed better than my usual razor and I didn&#x27;t get a single nick or cut. I might actually keep a few around just for that job in the shower. I think the constant flow of water over the razor and my skin helped it to perform better.</li>
    <li> These were a pleasant surprise when it comes to disposable razors.  Normally after using a disposable my face feels dry and tight and I need to use some type of moisturizer just to feel normal again.  I&#x27;ve been able to use these razors 2 times and still get that fresh feeling after my shave.  They don&#x27;t feel as weak as the normal disposable either.  So I feel like I&#x27;m using an expensive razor set when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I can just keep the wife away from stealing my extras!</li>
    <li> Solid. Not the greatest in the world, but they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little tug and pull right out of the package. Not much, but there is some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, these are much better than the &#x27;dollar store&#x27; options out there ... and even some of the more costly brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these as part of a promotion for the brand but it is my civic duty to give an objective opinion on them.</li>
    <li> Using the 1st razor for the past 3 weeks and it is still giving me a close smooth shave.  Best part is I&#x27;m not left with a useless handle (at last count I had 5 different handles) and no shaver head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;br /&gt;I did receive these razor&#x27;s as a trial, but I am not endorsing them because of that.  They really are a good, cheap close shave.</li>
    <li> I like these but my skin is so sensitive it made me breakout . I like the design and they do work better than regular disposables with less razors ! I got these on a bzzagent campaign for free .</li>
    <li> I really liked this disposable shaver. With its 5 heads, it really does give a quick shave.It comes with a new travel cap as well for shave during travel. No cut and bruises till now. I am happy that I got a worthy product to try</li>
    <li> Used the Schick Hydro 5 instead of the expensive refills that I usually use and they worked as good or better. I only shave once a week so the hair gets pretty long. These razors cut through it with any ill affects</li>
    <li> This is a good product . I not a shaveder myself but if you want a good shave I choose this. Good Luck Shaving.</li>
    <li> I tried this razor out as a freebie to give honest feedback. I don&#x27;t love shaving, and often grow my beard out just to avoid it. I&#x27;m always looking to try new products too make my shaving experience better. The Hydro 5 razor has a big long-lasting lubricant reservoir, decent nice grip though a bit light feeling for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor works fine, but I also have the schick hydro with repaceable blades that I think feels better and does a better job. I honestly prefer using shave gel without the extra \\&quot;lubricant\\&quot; which can stay on your face once your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was fine and functional - no stubble really, but I can&#x27;t say its incredibly different than other multiple blade razors, and i really wonder how many blades they think they need to add (wasn&#x27;t there an SNL skit about that?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I can recommend the razor- its shaves fine and I&#x27;d buy it on sale.</li>
    <li> Got a free sample from Bzzagent.  Good razors but not sure if they would be worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razors for a few weeks now. At first I was a little weirded out by the wet film that was left from the very wet conditioning strip (I guess that is why they call it &amp;#34;hydro&amp;#34;. But now I&#x27;m under the impression that it only helps the effectiveness of the shave. I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave than with these razors. Plus, they last a long time. I recommend to anyone especially those who shave their heads and are looking for a reliable, close shave.</li>
    <li> Very Smooth!  And I don&#x27;t mean just the shave, they actually feel very smooth on your body.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the rash guards or the 5 blades but I have never had a razor that felt this smooth.  They also give you a very close shave without any razor burns or nicks.  Some people are saying they can&#x27;t get in certain spots because the razor is so wide, but you can flip back the gel strip and then get into any spot.  I even tried this razor under my arm (where I normally do not shave) and had no problem there.  I also did part of my leg just to see how they would do.  I shaved my legs once before and got such a bad rash I decided never to do that again but with this razor I didn&#x27;t get a rash.  And the gel strip keeps going strong even after 2 weeks and really helps in sensitive areas.  I&#x27;ll be honest and tell you I am lazy when it comes to shaving.  I actually do it as I am in the shower and I don&#x27;t normally get a very close shave around my Adams apple because it is hard to do without a mirror and I would have to go over it in different directions and end up with a rash or a nick.  But with these razors I can go back and forth, up and down and get a very smooth shave with no rash or nicks.  The only reason I knocked them down one star is because of price.  They run around $3 each while my other disposables are about $.50 each.  But these work so much better I think I&#x27;ll keep a supply on hand.</li>
    <li> The razors are okay, but they just can&#x27;t match the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor feeling, especially on the first shave!</li>
    <li> Received this product for free from a promotion. After using electric razors for most of my life I was rather impressed with how well these razors performed. They get really close the first time around and don&#x27;t require multiple shaves. It gets it right the first time. Now i have only shaved three times but the razor is working as good as new! We will see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Good close shave but.....&lt;br /&gt;Handle is flimsy, not enough control. Head is too flexible and so rounded that you can not precisely shave near sideburns or goatees.</li>
    <li> I received a 3 pack from Schick as part of a promotion.  I&#x27;m extremely happy to have been so fortunate!  By far the best, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had with a disposable razor, and very close to the best for any razor I&#x27;ve used.  One pass is all it takes, and even the toughest stubble goes down without a problem.</li>
    <li> How many blades is too many?  Well I&#x27;ll tell you it&#x27;s NOT 5.  I love the 5 blade action of this razor.  My shave is smooth, clean and smooth (double smooth)!  The little blade used to get to those hard to reach places is a nice touch, but ultimately, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.  You think they&#x27;ll come out with a razor with 6 blades?  Ummm, yeah, it&#x27;s just a matter of time.  But until then, try this razor.  It might be kind of pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.  Skin is less irritated and the shave is real nice.</li>
    <li> Good razor for on the go travel or weekend camping trips not a everyday razor for me. Good choice because u don&#x27;t need shaving cream. Pros:eazy to use, flip trimmer good for facial hair to line up ur edge up, smooth pull, flexible for face contours.  Cons gets clogged easy, lubrication gel is really thick, have to press a little harder for makes u timmed</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Schick Hydro Disposable Razors as a product tester from Buzz Agent. I can honestly say that I love the razors! The close shave is awesome. I really liked how you can use a couple of the blades or you can flip the little top back and use all 5 blades for a close akin shave. These razors work wonders for me! I definitely want recommend these to any man who uses disposables.</li>
    <li> Before using these razors, I had used the Hydro 5 with a metal handle and replaceable blades for 5 years. In essence, I am used to Schick and the original model of the disposable blades.&lt;br /&gt;Easy enough, the handle is just a plastic version and the head part with the blades is the exact same as the former razor. The only difference I did not like is the lighter weight compared to a metal handle and the waste of throwing out the entire handle rather than just the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Why I think this razor is superior to others:&lt;br /&gt;1. The 5 blades allow a much smoother shave and increases durability. Because there are so many blades, each one has less work to do, thus increasing the lifespan of each blade.&lt;br /&gt;2. The flip trimmer. I did not realize the usefulness of it until I used another razor that did no use the flip trimmer. It allows you to get those hard to get spots thanks to the gel strip always getting in the way i.e. right below your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these razors are the best for a higher priced disposables. In the end, I would much rather prefer to use the metal hand type with disposable blade head over these, but if you need a decent disposable then these are for you!</li>
    <li> I received this from BzzAgent to try out.  I don&#x27;t use regular razors too often as I have been using an electric razor for years now, but I do like to use a normal razor when I have the time.  Due to this, I haven&#x27;t owned a long term razor in years so I buy disposables.  With it being compared to other disposables this is the best that I have used.  Right when I picked it up I knew this wasn&#x27;t so cheaply made like others. The Hydro 5 has nice weight and fits perfectly with my fingers.  The hydration gel worked great and made for a smooth and close cut.  During the first usage whenever I would take the razor from my face it would make stringy lines that would stick from my face to the razor.  It never effected the shaving but it did feel awkward.  During the 2nd usage this was no longer happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, this disposable is the closest you will get to a regular cartridge razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion ran by Schick, and I am very satisfied! I have always been skeptical when it comes to disposable razors, but these are top of the line in the razor category. I always get a super close shave, and don&#x27;t have to worry about tearing up my face like to many other disposable razors have done in the past. I love the hydrating get strip to help keep my skin from drying out. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received a trial pack of these from BzzAgent.com and was pleasantly surprised! I&#x27;m not usually a fan of disposables because there usually isn&#x27;t enough lubricant or I feel like I&#x27;m shaving with a knife taped to a plastic pen. These are honestly the best disposables I&#x27;ve ever used - close shave, solid grip, and plenty of lubricant.</li>
    <li> I also got this 3-pack free from BzzAgent. I already prefer Hydro 5 razors to any Gillette razors, so these were no different. They use the same blades that are in the non-disposable cartridges, and do just as well. The reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because its cheaper to just buy the replacement cartridges for the permanent handle, which pays itself off fast. Pay a premium for a disposable? Isn&#x27;t that the opposite of the idea here?</li>
    <li> I was able to try these out for free through a Bzzagent promotion and these disposable razors are great! First of all this was my first time using Schick brand razors, and I wasn&#x27;t let down. The razors give you a nice close shave with minimal to irritation. My favorite thing about these razors is the hydrating gel reservoir. I can actually feel a protective film like gel over my skin that helps when I shave. I would definitely use these again. The only negative thing I could find about these razors was the dullness of the razors after about three shaves. Other than that nothing else negative. Plus the Flip Trimmer really helped for squaring of the side burns and keeping that straight.</li>
    <li> I love these razors.  The five blades cut cleanly and I don&#x27;t have to put any pressure to make my face come out as smooth as a babies bottom.  The only problem I have is that the blade holder is so large it makes it impossible to judge where my sideburns begin, but this problem was solved with the ingenious pop up trimmer built into the razors.  The best part is that these razors last a long, long time.  I have used mine for a few months before the blades start to dull.  You really can&#x27;t buy a better disposable razor than these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been after a long time I tried disposable razor ,I got this product as a promotion from Schick and bzz .This razor does its job when it comes to a quick shave. It does not give a close shave like the electric onesbut overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I received several of these razors as part of  BzzAgent campaign via the company, and I do have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. Initially I was skeptical that I could get an acceptably close shave from a disposable, having been spoiled by more expensive razors. I so have to say after using them however that the product is certainly a recommendable one. If you ever have to go somewhere and don&#x27;t want to bring your electric razor or full shave kit, these should be at the top of your list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said it was not the closest shave I have ever gotten, and I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if the trend of adding more blades has (quickly) diminishing returns. I digress, this razor is great for the price, and should you ever be in a pinch, a more than capable replacement for expensive alternatives.</li>
    <li> The razor itself works well but the built in lotion becomes a gooey mess when wet. It also feels weird on your face. It&#x27;s like using too much lotion. #GotItFree Works well but not the best razor available.</li>
    <li> Overall great razor that provides an awesomely smooth shaving.</li>
    <li> (I am writing this under my wife&#x27;s Amazon account, but I am indeed a guy- I just can&#x27;t log out of her account on my computer for some reason)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this razor as part of a BzzAgent Campaign to try out for free.  I gotta say it is a very nice disposable razor.  I am the kind of guy who doesn&#x27;t like to shave (mostly out of laziness) and shaves every 7-10 days, or as needed to look nicer for work.  I have never had any issue with a particular razor.  I can&#x27;t say I have ever used a razor that didn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I gotta say this razor is nice.  It is nicer than the Mach-3 blade I have been using for years.  One great thing about it is that despite being brand-new, I didn&#x27;t get cut at all.  And I was raking through a 10+ day beard.  Normally brand-new razors leave me a little bloody.  Not this one.  And speaking of the beard, I was impressed how this razor cut through a pretty thick face of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, a close shave, with no discomfort during or after shaving, and it cut through a thick beard- which is admirable.</li>
    <li> This Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor have a great shaving blade, easy to handle I like that there&#x27;s no dryness after shaving and the trimmer is a great feature. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand with bzzagent and been using them a lot lately. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> These razors are awesome, just doesn&#x27;t work well for me on my neck area. I still have to use my Gillette Fusion. Other than that, no complaints on it. I received this as a sample for BzzAngent. Good Razor, just not for me, I don&#x27;t like disposables.</li>
    <li> i would not buy again</li>
    <li> I received a sample pack that brought some serious excitement into the life of my facial hair. A new razor! Sadly, I&#x27;m very disappointed in my experience with this product. The gel strip leaves behind a thick coating of stringy, sticky goop. This wouldn&#x27;t be so awful if it actually worked. I felt a massive amount of tug and pull through the entire shave and even drew blood once. When I had finally finished my &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;, I was goopy, bloody, and still fuzzy. I never give one star reviews as I can usually find some good in a product, but I have to say that there was none to be found here.</li>
    <li> Less cuts and more hydration made this razor get my vote, I&#x27;m tired of the ones where I end up with a ton of dots and toilet paper all over my face to stop the bleeding. I have dry skin so this worked for me and it was smooth (glided nice) and I got a close shave!  #SchickHydro #BzzAgent #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used disposable razors in a while. Why? Because I would break out with acne for whatever reason. So I was hesitant to try the Schick Hydro 5 disposables, but I received a free sample courtesy of Schick so I decided to give it a try. After using for a few weeks I am clean shaven, but acne free. The cut doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I have had no blemishes. Friends of mine said they had the same issue so I recommended the Schick Hydro 5 razor and they have had good reviews of it as well.</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent, I received a 3 pack of these to try out.  I was leery, since disposables tend to hack my face.  These performed better than normal disposables.  I am able to get several shaves before the hacking begins.&lt;br /&gt;The GOOD: reusable. smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;The BAD: I would have preferred fewer blades (5 is a bit too many). There is a bit too much gel on the blade.  I end up rinsing off all the excess in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;In general, I would give these another try when I need disposables.  For general shaving, I still prefer my electric and replaceable-blade shavers.</li>
    <li> I received these for free from BzzAgent to try and I was quite pleased with them. I have a beard in general and I am not a big fan of shaving, especially with disposable razors. I literally cannot use them for fear of hacking up my face. These were the except to that. They we like the real deal, i.e. the non-disposable razors. Also, they lasted must longer then expected without losing their quality! I am glad to know that going forward I have this option.</li>
    <li> You should know that this product works better than most disposables.  For the price, you&#x27;ll get a quality razor that lasts a good amount of time.  I would almost compare them to a regular razor but their lifetime just won&#x27;t be as long.  I have found that I have clean shaves without irritation.  There is also a gel on them that makes shaving a bit less unenjoyable.</li>
    <li> I love these razors. I have a sensitive face and have had a rough time finding a razor that doesn&#x27;t eat me up. This is that razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is the cross over SUV of razors. Not a full time daily shaver nor a cheapie disposable. Unfortunately where it truly disappoints is on the very progeny of its being. It shaves poorly. The head of the razor has a comfort coating of some kind that inadvertently slicks down some hairs, causing you to double back or dry shave a couple stragglers once your done. Fail shick. That&#x27;s like one dollar gas... That doesn&#x27;t combust, thus failing to propel the automobile. I confess that my daily shaver is a shick Quattro and has been for several years. Skip on this razor... Pack your at home razor or buy a cheapie. Sorry shick.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t expect much from any &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; razor these days. Yet companies keep pushing them out with more and more blades, as if that magically makes a difference. This razor has far too many blades, especially for its weight. When will people and/or companies learn that the best shave comes from a razor heavy enough to pull itself? The handle is almost weightless, meaning I&#x27;m left forcing 4 blades over my shaving area rather than the razor doing the work itself. This requires pushing down for more pressure while pulling. The result: irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;But it has 4 blades for closeness!&amp;#34; - Wrong, it has four blades for marketing. Let&#x27;s assume you make only two passes, which is generally considered the way to shave. You&#x27;re still dragging 8 blades over the same spot! Not only that, do you think all four blades are getting the benefit of that useless strip of goo at the top of the cartridge? They&#x27;re not. So now you have at a minimum six blades being pushed down and drug over the same spot with practically no lubricant. This is what produces the irritation, and essentially renders this razor nothing more than another cheap gimmick not worth its own weight (which as mentioned earlier is practically nothing anyway).</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was a little surprised. Disposable razors are not supposed to be great, but this one actually is. Crazy, because I have a gnarly beard I need to keep under control. Plus, I shave my kid&#x27;s head (neck), and the razor does awesome. Got out and get a few, and be impressed that you can shave, for less!</li>
    <li> I got a few free samples of these and used them for a bit. I am not a &#x27;disposable&#x27; sort of person having the experience of disposable razors shredding my skin and drawing significant amount of blood. I am happy to report that these razors are actually blood free. The shave was smooth and comparable to a non-disposable. The blades are good for about a week which makes them a perfect travelling companion. I would recommend them to any person seeking a disposable shaving solution</li>
    <li> I am a bzzagent and received these razors as a promotion to try them out and review. (Check out Bzzagent.com for more info) This razor is packed full of features for the price. Unfortunately, like some products that focus too much on the bells and whistles and not enough on the base performance, I feel the razor blade themselves were not up to par. I&#x27;ve used many different brands and styles of razors, but don&#x27;t often see the razor blade rust after one use. These are great on the go for travel where they won&#x27;t be subjected to moisture daily like an everyday razor would, or if you keep your razor up and away from splashing water. So other than the fact the razor blade itself might not stack up against competition, the features and price are a great reason to try them out for yourself to see how they work for you</li>
    <li> These razors are great if you shave after a shower with lots of warm water (which you probably should be doing anyways). The hydrating gel gets a little sticky if there isnt enough moisture. But, when there is, these things glide really well</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! After using this product, I never want to go back to my old razors. This one leaves my face softer and less stubs. I know this for sure because my girlfriend tells me so.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razors via a Bzz Agent campaign. They are very nice disposable razors and should be near the top of everyone&#x27;s razor shopping list. They provide a comfortable shave and do not irritate sensitive skin. I have struggled to find razors that are comfortable for a few shaves before needing to be disposed and these fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: comfortable shave, non-irritable to sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: doesn&#x27;t have a wide-open back so cleaning is more difficult than it should be, no detail blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t mind purchasing another pack of these razors to shave with in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! very smooth and works great.</li>
    <li> These razors are awesome! I got to try these through bzzagent.com and loved them. Due to cost I actually prefer these to the non-disposables. I have sensitive skin and these caused minimal irritation.</li>
    <li> Usually Im just a run a razor across my face kinda guy... I just wet, shave and shove off! Typically my face hurts, burns, cuts, and not as sharp as I can look... but some razors can expensive and thats an expense I just dont like to shell out for...&lt;br /&gt;Trying the Schick Hydro5 I didnt really bring any expectations - I was going to try it out and leave it at that... a razor is a razor...&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Schick Hydro5 on a Saturday - didnt even plan on shaving that day but decided I was bored and remembered it was in the bathroom...&lt;br /&gt;Its was a Saturday that changed my face forever!&lt;br /&gt;Is it a disposable razor or a magic wand? This hurry up and shave man has been transformed! Its such a quick, close smooth shaving experience! No pain, no cuts, quality of razor and shave is amazing and ok - I look GQ!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend the Schick Hyrdo5 to that guy who really isnt into razor hunting or looks at the whole shaving ordeal about as thrilling as brushing teeth - dont over look the face man - you are missing out!&lt;br /&gt;Schick Hydro has me sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand</li>
    <li> Good for a disposable razor, but not as good as cartridge system.  Got quite a few cuts while shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a really great razor.  I love the hydrating get - it keeps my skin smooth.  The handle and grip on it are comfortable.  The blades are nice because they seem to irritate my skin less than other brands of razors.  I look forward to buying more of these razors!</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I use these for everything but my face. Cheapest 5 blade disposable set there is, work well in the shower</li>
    <li> For many years I used a competitors product. I got tired of using a blade for only a week before I had to replace it. The Schick hydro lasts at least 3 weeks when used daily. It shaves very closely to the point that I don&#x27;t have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow till after 8. The handle is very ergonomic. I would highly recommend the Hydro over other products. I received this as part of a promotion from BZZ Agent.</li>
    <li> Received the Schick Hydro 5 disposable razors from BzzAgent recently. At first I was quite impressed. The razors seemed to do the trick well, cleanly shaved my facial growth each morning for the first four mornings. By the fifth morning however, and only after 4 shaves the blade seemed incredibly dull and left me with stubble and irritation. I suppose though, that the definition of  &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; is rather accurate in this instance. I also own the replaceable head version of this very razor. I can accurately attest that the non-disposable version of the Schick Hydro 5 lasts much longer, and provided me with closer, smoother shaves over a longer period of time. All in all, I would have to say that these disposables work well, and are a good value for the money. Just don&#x27;t expect to get months of use out of each razor!</li>
    <li> These are an amazing razor! They offer a close smooth shave that I haven&#x27;t experienced in a very long time! I git these free to try to offer an honest opinion and all I can say is wow!</li>
    <li> I received a package of Schick razors for free as part of a promotion through Schick and BzzAgent. I shave once a day and the Schick Hydro 5 leaves my face feeling smooth, shave after shave. The flexible 5-blade design reduces nasty shaving cuts dramatically. Even my wife has been known to grab one of these razors to quickly &#x27;dry shave&#x27; her underarms and she has been very happy with the results. I would definitely purchase these in the future.</li>
    <li> First the good: Clean smooth shave, nice hydration from the hydrating gel reservoir. No irritation after shave. If you are a guy that shaves your chest, this blade is perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the not so good:  I have a small face and I found this razor to be too big for me. I currently use a Mach 3 which is perfect for me. I also dry shave because, outside of my goatee, I don&#x27;t have much of a beard. This blade does not dry shave as well at all. I didn&#x27;t like the flip trimmer at all. I found no use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this is a good blade for the right face.</li>
    <li> Was one of the worst razors that I have used</li>
    <li> These razors are incredible for the price. Smooth clean shave everytime and super cheap for what you are getting.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that with these razors I just need a wet face no gel or cream required no I don&#x27;t have a real heavy beard so if you do you may need that other lubricant but this does a great job. I shave about three times a week and a razor last a really long time for me.</li>
    <li> Recieved these samples as a BzzAgent. Super impressed. Gave as close a shave as Proglide, but blades last so much longer, and get a more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Thease are the best disposable razors that I&#x27;ve ever come across. The gel that oozes from the razor head is awesome.  I will be using these razors from now on!</li>
    <li> I i received this product to try for free from BzzAgent. I always was a fan if Schick products and I really liked this one too. It gives a very close shave and without irritating my skin. Even my wife said that it is much better than her Gilette Venus that she uses.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as a promotional item from Bzzagent. I would say they are definitely far better than the average, cheap disposable razor. The shave I got with these was as close and smooth as I would expect to get from a more expensive reloadable razor. However, I wouldn&#x27;t say these are just as good a reloadable razor. I have rather coarse hair on my face and I did experience more tugging with this razor than I do with my cartridge razor. Overall, though, I very good product.</li>
    <li> These things rock. I have always been a fan of the fusion razor that&#x27;s not disposable I have used it for as long as I can remember. But then when I got these from bzzzagent I gave them a try and I was very impressed I haven&#x27;t had that close of a shave in along time. They got closer than the expensive fusion could ever get. All in all I would rate my&lt;br /&gt;experience on these schick hydro 5 the best razor I have used to date. I&#x27;m gonna keep buying theses disposable razors cause they work so good. Love em.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use many disposable razors but got some of these to try for free from bzzagent. I usually use a double-edged safety razor to shave. I was impressed by this product and the quality of the handle and razor. It provides a smooth shave with no irritation or cuts, I could shave quickly (unlike with my safety razor) and almost recklessly and never cut myself. To really test it I even shaved against the grain for a super-close shave with no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many razors. These are now my main shave. They are a one stroke, clean cut and perfect shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave, as good as any no disposable could ever be. I recommend these to all my fellow shavers. They make a great product at an affordable price. And a plus is they last a long time for a disposable.</li>
    <li> Really quality razor that is disposable which in the past has been an oxymoron. Oils lubricated and the strong blades glided through the hair to produce a non irritating shave for a fraction of the price of the high priced non disposables.</li>
    <li> Great razors. Close shave and stay sharp for several shaves.</li>
    <li> I received these as a BzzAgent and they work well, a close shave that is a smooth glide on sensitive skin.  Quite refreshing.</li>
    <li> I am a 19 year old male that received a pack of these in the mail to review for bzzagent. I have a decent beard on my face, so I generally don&#x27;t shave too much. Currently I have an electric razor that I really like. I tried out these disposable razors and I really like them. I only used them to clean up around my beard and my neck. I got a clean smooth shave and I didn&#x27;t get any cuts. Very impressed with that. I also like the gel on the edges. If I actually shaved my whole face, I&#x27;d prefer these Schick Hydro 5 disposables to my electric!</li>
    <li> These are a set of really fancy disposable razors...gone are the days of 2 blades and been replaced with 5 blades with hydrating features. I have sensitivity to bladed razors and it makes my skin very dry, itchy and then I break out. I responded well to them and didn&#x27;t suffer from dry skin. A great purchase if you are looking for sturdy but disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I received this free to test from bzzagent. First,I liked the razor, I got a smooth shave .But what I don&#x27;t like is how bulky it is and also every time I pushed to shave and the white part at the top would snap back.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave with thorough hydration throughout. The residue does not wash off as easily as shave cream alone, but it is a fair tradeoff.</li>
    <li> These Hydro 5 razors are great! Before trying them, I wanted nothing to do with a disposable based on past experiences but these worked just as well as my usual razor and lasted through several shaves to boot. Thanks Schick!</li>
    <li> Very good razor. I mostly use electric razors but I&#x27;ve tried different disposable razors also. These were as good as any other brand I&#x27;ve tried, and better than most. Gives a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> I have never used a Schick blade, mainly used my Gilette Power Mach 3 razor. Received through a BzzAgent promo, the first thing u will notice are the five blades and the large size of the head. Precision cutting with the blade is possible with the blade that flips down but even then; well it may take time to get used to but I couldn&#x27;t. The grip feels comfortable that I can give compared to the Mach 3 I feel it definitely prefers larger hands it just fits well.  During the shave is where I think the blade just tries to hard. When shaving the gel reservoir that is hyped up on everything just seems like to much. While shaving it is just plain goopy. As you move the blade you can tell this stuff is on your face as it leaves strings on your face, like cheese on a hot pizza. I&#x27;m not sure of the five blades but for me I don&#x27;t see it as better than the Mach 3. The shave I received was not better it was same. Cost. Considering cost would place this as the better option. What keeps me away is the goop and the large size of the head. I noticed also I had several nicks on my neck again it creates a smooth large shave so u (well I did) will go faster, lesson learned. Quick conclusion, this will not replace my go to blade but it is a great travel option until I get home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the sort of guy who shaves. I usually have a long beard and prefer it to the hassle of taking blade to face. But I figured that I would give being clean shaven a try since I got a free pack of Schick Hydro 5 Disposables from BzzAgent. And you know what? I dig &#x27;em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a close shave from a disposable. I also wasn&#x27;t expecting that my girlfriend would grab one of the razors for her own shaving needs and enjoy them too. They&#x27;re good razors and I&#x27;m not just saying that. Pick &#x27;em up. I know I will the next time I decide to shave.</li>
    <li> I received samples of the Hydro 5 Disposables from BzzAgent. I like the close shave and have lost my five-o-clock shadow. The term &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; is misleading because I get about two weeks out of each razor. The handle is comfortable with a good grip. The blade still has a bit of the disposable razor flimsiness that caused a little razor burn at first. I started using coconut oil as a pre-shave and that remedied the situation. These are definitely the best disposable razors on the market today.</li>
    <li> I received this free to use from Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;First I&#x27;d like to say my skin is sensitive and I normally use a singlee blade safety razor as these 4 to 5 blade razors normally  just cause me too much skin irritation and I end up getting razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;With that said,  I will continue to use my safety razor but the Shick Hydro 5 disposables are a great alternative with their convenience and quality of shave.&lt;br /&gt;I  used these for a month straight before commenting and after this time I find my skin soft and mostly free from irritation aside from a few hairs on my neck that always get irritated when shaving 5 or more times per week. I normally shave 3-4 times weekly but have tried 6 times weekly with these hydro 5&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I found with these I didn&#x27;t even need to use lotion! The best feature to me is the built-in moisture strip. They glide without snagging or pulling hair and my skin feels calm and soothed post shave. I got about 10 shaves until the strip was no longer at all effective but about 14 good shaves out of the blades until pulling began.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy these again for their convenience especially if traveling on business and in need of a time saving shave that looks good and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin beyond tolerable levels.</li>
    <li> Got this for free from Schick via BzzAgent to try and review so here we go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First my Pros and Cons list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Gel cartridge gives a really smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;Gel allows razor to glide effortlessly on your face&lt;br /&gt;Gel cartridge lasts for quite a while&lt;br /&gt;Razor gets really close, probably one of the closest shaves&lt;br /&gt;Best disposable razor I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Gel lubricates maybe a bit too well, causes razor to slip course&lt;br /&gt;If you shave in the shower, the handle becomes slippery quite easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was really shocked by the quality Schick put in their disposable razor. I am used to disposables being cheap in price and quality. That is not the case here. The razor gave one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had compared to my normal razor the Gillette Fusion Power. I have only two complaints. The gel, while helping to give a smooth effortless shave, became a little too slick. Sometimes this caused my razor to slide on it&#x27;s course. That, and since I shave in the shower, the handle grip, while good dry, gets slippery and doesn&#x27;t have a good grip when wet. Combine those two things and it can be a little scary. I cut myself a good one on my chin as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think it&#x27;s a great razor but you might want to be careful while you shave with it.</li>
    <li> A couple months ago I received these as part of a promotion from Schick, and I had a full beard.  I mainly used an electric shaver for the neck area and used a manual for trimming/edging.  Multi-blade razors are usually difficult for trimming, so I typically use a single blade.  When I received these, I decided to start off by trying the flip trimmer feature in place of the single blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flip trimmer feature is great.  You get more precision while keeping the benefits of multiple blades.  However, I didn&#x27;t feel it beat my single blade&#x27;s precision.  That said, this feature makes it a better all-around razor.  If I was only using one shaving implement, it would be this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once winter was over, I decided to shave the beard completely. I wanted to test the difference, and I did half of my face with my electric and half with the Hydro 5.  I&#x27;ve switched from electric before and ended up with a cut up face for a few days.  I was worried that my skin would not be accustomed to a manual shave and I wanted to see if this new razor would be better than previous experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results:  The electric took about five minutes and gave an OK shave.  No problems there.  The Hydro 5 took one minute and gave a much smoother shave but I had a (literally) very red face.  I felt no irritation and there was just one nick, and after a few minutes the redness went away.  I used it again the next day for my whole face, and there was no issue.  It made for a very quick transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative that only applies to cheapskates like myself:  Once the gel reservoir runs out, this razor gets uncomfortable to use very quickly.  I often go far too long between replacing blades, and will sometimes use one as long as it&#x27;s in one piece.  The gel makes for a smoother shave, but it is a very necessary for this razor.</li>
    <li> I received the razors as a part of a free review, and was fairly impressed by the disposables.  I am used to cartridge shaving and always thought of disposables as more of a last second in a rush type razor.  The shave is comparable to that of a mach 3 and the blades last about as long.  It did the job very well except for being a little &amp;#34;grabby&amp;#34; on my face.  At times it felt almost like rubbing sand paper on my face.  All in all it is a pretty decent product.</li>
    <li> I love how great the shave is and how long it lasts. My face feels so smooth after each shave. And with 5 blades it makes a very great feeling and no tugging of the hairs as you shave. I am so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> BzzAgent Review of Free Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m generally an electric razor kind of guy, but I got a pack of these Hydro 5 Disposables by Schick to try out.  These are probably the best disposable I have ever used.  My first use was on a typical morning after I had been shaving the past few days regularly so just the daily stubble.  This razor conquered with no issue and left a very smooth surface behind with no irritation.  Then I let my facial hair grow out for the weekend and tried again on the following Monday morning.  In this situation I would normally have to shave at least twice to get a clean, close shave but with the Hydro 5 Disposable a single shave surprisingly did the job!  Consider me sold at that point!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these aren&#x27;t going to replace the use of my electric razor, for special occasions when I need that extra close shave, these will be my go to blades.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product compliments of Schick through BzzAgent.  Five blades makes quite a tall razor.  When you add a hydrating strip at top and bottom. . . Whoa. It did take a little while to get used to the size.  Unfortunately, I happen to have a goatee and using such a big razor makes it difficult to accurately trim around it.  I do shave everyday with a simple twin blade disposable.  The Schick Hydro 5 does give one of the closest shaves I have ever had.  I do have a problem with its price tag.  $5 would be more appropriate for a three pack of disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Very nice shave with these. I don&#x27;t usually use 5 blades but these did a good job. One last for quite a while if you shave once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> These razors provide a close shave.  They last more than one shave which is sometimes an issue for me.  The gel also seems to last a little bit longer which is good for keeping the razor lubricated and gliding smoothly along your face or whatever your shaving! The price is a little high, but would buy again!</li>
    <li> These shavers work very well, especially for contours, because they have a great range of motion. The gel sometimes seems a bit too slimy, but if you&#x27;re a man using these on your face, you might appreciate that additional slickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses I dropped one of these razors in the shower and the head popped off. I was irritated, because I thought it was broken. But once I got out of the shower I found that it was really easy to put back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to spend the money for premium disposables, I can definitely recommend these razors. I&#x27;m not sure if five blades are really necessary, but they do give a nice smooth shave and are comfortable in the hand.</li>
    <li> The Hydro 5 is the best disposable razor I have ever used. It&#x27;s five blades with skin guard allow you to have a quick clean shave everyday. The lubrication bar on top of the razor helps lubricate the faces and it makes it easier to shave your face and most of the time I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream so that&#x27;s a plus. #GotItFree #Schick #Sponsored</li>
    <li> When I removed the razor from the package, I literally laughed. It looks like something straight from a Saturday Night Live sketch: \\&quot;Why buy a razor with three blades when you can have one with fifteen!?\\&quot; The over-sized appearance is super silly. Moreover, I have gotten much closer shaves from a \\&quot;simple\\&quot; (and less expensive) three-blade razor. This one is a bit cumbersome. Additionally, I first used it with a lotion and the razor skipped over and over. Then, I tried it without lotion, and it gave a better, but awkward shave. My underarms were left \\&quot;prickly\\&quot; even after several passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it matters, the aesthetics appear as though it is a generic razor. The instrument is a flat, opaque color. And, for me, was definitely not ergonomic. (It feels/looks like something from the 1980&#x27;s with extra blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, for me, less is certainly more.</li>
    <li> Smooth, slick and easy to clean, is the best way to describe these disposable razors. You know how some shaving creams come \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; and can be hard to rinse from a razor? Not these! The extra wide head and spacing of blades, somehow makes it very easy to rinse even with semi-low water pressure. They also provide a very close and smooth shave without having to pass over more than once, maybe twice. No ingrown hairs or razor burns with these bad boys! Watch out or you may nick yourself! I would recommend this product to anyone looking to try a very competent and slick shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the only razor I will use. Glad this is part of the subscribe and save program. 5 blades makes a difference compared to 4.</li>
    <li> I was quite a fan of this razor.  Even though it was a disposable I thought that it lasted quite a while a delivered a close and smooth shave.  If you are looking for a disposable, or are in need of a new razor I suggest you check it out</li>
    <li> I received from BzzAgent as part of a product review. NO razor burn from these razors which is something I usually always get from shaving. The water activated gel help a ton. Nice clean, close shave for VERY smooth skin!! Very impressed!</li>
    <li> It was amazing shave...very clean and neat....that kind of shave make my skins smooth like a baby...</li>
    <li> I live this razor. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a disposable.  Two many great features to throw away. I love the flip top to get the close shaves like your side burn line.  It cleans easy and shaves very well. If your looking for a great razor without the expense then buy these..</li>
    <li> I am  Bzzagent and received these razors for free, to test and review. The overall packaging was easily opened revealing a very nice product, three disposable razors with just about the same quality as a higher end cartridge razor. It provided a clean smooth shave with very little effort, I would recommend these razors to anyone who buys disposables or even if you don&#x27;t usually they would be great when traveling. Also the single blade is great for getting close to hard to get areas such as under your nose.</li>
    <li> I received this 3 pack of Schick Hydro 5 from a BzzAgent campaign and I have to give it to Schick they did a great job on these razors. They gave me a super close shave without feeling like I was tearing my skin or cutting myself all over. Highly recommend if you are travel bound.</li>
    <li> With five blades you can feel working simultaneously, you will wish your facial hair grew quicker just so you can shave again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(FYI: I received a sample as part of a Schick promotion to try it. But I would buy it!)</li>
    <li> These are by far one of it not the best disposable razor out there. I can get 6-10 shaves out of the razor before the blades show any signs of dulling.  I think the lubrication strip has a lot to do with this.  Not the standard sticky flaky type that other razors have.  They work very well and last longer than any other lubrication strip I&#x27;ve used. My wife also loves these for shaving her legs and etc...as they don&#x27;t knick the skin or pull.  They hold up to use longer than most, I can attest to this because my wife tends to leave them in the shower after use.  I also own the non disposable version of this razor as well.  I did receive these as a promotional product...Fortunately I am a regular user so could not turn down the free trial.  BZZAGENT is an awesome service to be a part of.  I cant say enough about these razors, quick smooth and lasting make these, as I mentioned one of the best if not the best.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin so shaving can sometimes be a punishment for me. The Schick Hydro 5 carved out my rough beard and left my face intact.  I didn&#x27;t have the razor rash and bright red razor marks other brands leave behind.</li>
    <li> Got to try these for free as part of a promotion from buzzagent and Schick. They seems like great razors for what they are, disposable. I don&#x27;t suspect you&#x27;d get more than 1-3 uses out of them, depending on how much growth you are shaving off. I took off about a weeks worth, and it was some work, but I was probably asking too much of them. The shave was close. It was fairly comfortable, considering how long I waited to try them. If I wasn&#x27;t so against the notion of using disposable razors, I&#x27;d probably use them again. I just don&#x27;t think the concept of a disposable razor is sustainable.</li>
    <li> These work pretty well for a disposable razor. Probably better than the Gillette Fusion I used to use. The gel strip does a great job and I used this without any shaving cream. I probably won&#x27;t replace a double-edge razor that I use but for trips and things like that, this would work well.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I got a great, close shave out of these razors, and with the gel reservoir I didn&#x27;t have to worry about dry, bumpy skin after I was done.  When I flipped the gel reservoir back I was able to get a neat, straight line where my beard meets my skin.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> To start with this topic I must tell you that I have been using Gillette product ever since I started shaving. I started with Gillette mach 3 and then moved to the latest gillette products and since I was happy with Gillette products, I never thought of switching to any other shaving product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for your information I am eastern Indian and have an oily sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BzzAgent.com sent me this Schick Hydro 5 razors, and after using the razor I thought of giving them a shout out as you can tell I am impressed with Schick Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Things about the blade:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 blades give you very close shave with single stroke&lt;br /&gt;The gel reservoir keeps your skin hydrated ,so you do not feel irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I tried with 3 - 4 days old stubble and it worked fine, so of course I was impressed and I did not get any razor bumps. One thing, the handle will appear to be odd if you are a Gillette user like I am.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor. The positive is the soothing gel and clean shave it provides. However, I thought the five blades were an overkill. The traditional two blade razor I normally use provides a shave that is comparable. In my opinion, the razor head is too flexible and the ergonomic handle does not provide any advantages over the traditional razor handle (which I prefer to this razor handle). When I was shaving under my nose, it felt like the razor barely fit and I nicked my nose a couple of times.</li>
    <li> I received these razors as a free sample from BzzAgent, and I was eager to try them out and see if they could make my shave more comfortable.  Ordinarily my shaving routine is straightforward: one pass with the grain and one across the grain is enough to get me baby-smooth—for the most part.  However, the hair at the bottom of my neck grows with the grain pointing upward.  Before using the Schick Hydro 5 razors, I had to make a tough choice: do I want a stubbly neck, or do I want nicks and irritation?  When I shaved this morning, however, I decided to see if the shave oils on the Schick razor would help combat my shaving woes.  I’m happy to report that these razors allowed me to go against the grain comfortably, and without any red bumps or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also impressed at the quality of the Schick Hydro 5 razors.  The gel reservoir flips up so that I can trim my sideburns, which isn’t an option with most other razors, disposable or not.  Most disposable razors also sacrifice sturdiness for convenience, but these ones are an exception.  I shave two or three times a week, and I can see the three razors in this pack lasting for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I’m very happy with the Schick Hydro 5, and I would definitely repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> Fair disclosure:  I received a free sample of these, but I&#x27;m being given no other consideration for this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got these in the mail, I assumed that one multi blade razor would the more or less the same as another multi blade razor.  While I can&#x27;t compare the Schick Hydro 5 to the Gilette Mach 5, I can compare it to my usual disposables and my Mach 3, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I found that the shave I got with the Hydro was about as smooth as the Mach 3 when done, however, it took fewer swipes to attain a smooth shave.  This in turn left my skin feeling less irritated after shaving.  I honestly can&#x27;t say whether this is because of the &amp;#34;hydro&amp;#34; technology of just the number of blades.  Either way, its a nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as compared the bag of Bics that are my typical disposable, obviously the Schick is a little more expensive up front, however after two weeks, my Schick still feels almost a sharp as new.  I rarely get 3-4 days out of a Bic before it starts showing signs of dulling.  The Bic still comes out cheaper, but its a lot less waste with the Schick, and for lazy people that don&#x27;t like to replace a razor every couple of days, its also nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about it, and the reason it loses a star, is that the design of the head doesn&#x27;t allow my to get the whiskers right under my nose easily.  The Bic and the Mach 3 do that better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, for $10 for 3 blades that will last me about 6 weeks, I think its a great price/performance ration.</li>
    <li> I was given this razor from the site bzzagent. I haven&#x27;t used disposable razors in years because I would constantly cut myself. No matter how hard I tried and how fresh the razor was I would always nick myself. It drove me crazy. This one is similar to the type I used to have but the hydration seems to work a lot better and last the whole time.  I really didn&#x27;t take much effort at all to get a great shave.  It is nice to have this close of a shave again after all these years of electric razor stubble.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the shave I got from these razors!  I&#x27;ve been loyal to Mach 3 for years and skeptical of the need for additional blades, but this razor felt great in use and my face was smooth as can be after!</li>
    <li> I recently #GotItFree by becoming a BzzAgent and am glad I did. The razor feels a lot like other high end razors I&#x27;ve used, but what really made me like it was the amazing gel it uses. This gave me the smoothest feeling of any I&#x27;ve used previously. And with someone that has issues with in grown hairs and sensitive skin, this seemed to help that even more. I highly recommend trying these out.  The other thing to note, even though these are disposable, they can definitely be used more than once.</li>
    <li> I received a package of these razors as a promotion. While I still intend to use my old standby razor in my normal day to day, I will certainly now use the Schick Hydro 5 for my emergency, vacation, and business trip needs.  It meets every test I could possibly hope to throw at it.  Not only did it give me a close shave, the moisture strip meant that I didn&#x27;t get even a hint of razor burn or itch.</li>
    <li> I got these razors through the BzzAgent program.  Wasn&#x27;t my favorite razor for my face.  I have a sensitive face and go through quite a process to ensure I have a good shave every morning.  VERY HOT water, right amount of creme or rub, clean razor often, etc.  Below is a list of Pros and Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- head is large&lt;br /&gt;- didn&#x27;t find the razor blades to be as sharp as I other razors I have used leaving a rash feeling after shaving&lt;br /&gt;- the ability to flip the blade for &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34; shaving was not useful and actually hard to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- price&lt;br /&gt;- great for shaving other body parts.  just didn&#x27;t like it for my face&lt;br /&gt;- wife loved them and now doesn&#x27;t use my razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, these weren&#x27;t my favorite razor for face shaving, but worked good enough for shaving other body parts.</li>
    <li> These razors are absolutely amazing. I would never ever use another razor. Simply amazing.  I received this as a part of the bzzagent shick campaign.  And I am very pleased with the results</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I quit using disposable razors. I always found them painful and that they weren&#x27;t very effective. I guess the disposable razor technology has advanced. Although this razor is considered disposable, the shave I got was of the non-disposable caliber. A very comfortable and close shave. It also has an option to allow you to use it as a trimmer....genius!!!!!</li>
    <li> Recently received this from BZZAGENT and I gave It a try, These razors are awesome, gives a smooth finish and a close shave. and makes your skin feeling smooth and radiant</li>
    <li> Got a clean, smooth shave without any nicks or razor burn.  The 5 blades make for a smooth ride down the face and contours to the face for a clean shave.  I received this as a member of BzzAgent to try, it exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> Recieved these samples as a BzzAgent. Definitely impressed. Gave as close a shave as Proglide, but blades last longer, and get a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate the wider surface area also.</li>
    <li> I usually sport a full beard, and even when I shave, it&#x27;s the hair trimmer at the lowest setting.  I had an event that I couldn&#x27;t sport the rough &amp; tumble look.  My coarse facial hair has won the battle against quite a few different disposables, and some of the non-disposables are just too darn expensive for &amp;#34;sometimes&amp;#34; use.  The Hydro 5 wins the battle across the board.  It&#x27;s a great disposable, the price was great (I received mine as a part of an online promotion), and the five bladed design cut down my stubble like a lumberjack falling trees.</li>
    <li> Its very much a meh razor. It tugs at facial hair and the razor blades dull very quickly. Its good for a short trip but anything longer than 3-4 shavings and your face will feel pretty raw. I also feel that the number of blades (5) is totally excessive and that the price if you are using this product on a daily basis is very high. I received this free razor as part of a BzzAgent campaign.</li>
    <li> The Schick Hydro 5 razor gave me a very close and smooth shave. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to cover my face with bottles of aftershave from irritation afterwards. I also let two co-workers try them and they both gave me positive feedback about the Schick Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a set of the Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor as a part of a promotion for the brand. My review is honest and simply to help others decide if this is the right product for them before giving away your hard earned money.*</li>
    <li> First off let me start by saying that I received these razors for free from BzzAgent and asked to give them a try.  This point is really irrelevant since I&#x27;ve been using their non disposable ones for years and let me tell you, these &amp;#34;disposables&amp;#34; perform just as great as the non disposables.  I&#x27;ve been using one razor since 29 January 2015 and have yet to experience any sign of dulling or irritation from this razor.  The lubricating Gel is fantastic and removes the need to use any sort of shave gel or foam.  This is a really fantastic razor that I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got these free through BzzAgent, and I have to say, as disposables go, they do pretty well. I shave against the grain a lot, and it really matters what razor I use, otherwise I get some major irritation. I had next to no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They shave pretty close, and the lubricant lasts for quite a while. For a disposable, they&#x27;re also pretty durable. I got a pack of three, and I&#x27;m still able to use the first one with no issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the brand, though disposable razors are definitely not a sustainable choice, so I&#x27;m going to probably opt to buy the ones with replaceable heads rather than the disposable kind. As far as disposable razors go, they are pretty much top of the list.</li>
    <li> I received the Schick Hydro as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use my electric razor 2x a week as a basic shave, then the Schick Hydro as the main clean up (lines and edges).&lt;br /&gt;It works very well - smooth skin afterwards without irritation. I have not seen an ingrown hairs or experienced much knicks while using the razor.</li>
    <li> Never really trusted a disposable Razor...i was able to get these through a Bzz campaign and boy was i surprised at the quality. Besides shaving smoothly i found no trace of razor burns or irritation on my neck ( i sport a beard so my neck is the only thing i shave) the lubrication strip is good for quick shaves while showering as well. Great product.</li>
    <li> What I would want to know before buying this produce is simple; how good are they at doing their intended job? Of course theres not always a simple answer, but for these razors, there is! They are great. The shave is close and smooth, the shaving oils are soft and not too oily, and arguably one of the most important things; they stay sharp for quite a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first thing I noticed when using these razors were the shaving oils, they are crazy soft, though for some people it might be a little too much, I really liked them because I usually get dry skin around where I shave and with these razors I did not! You can also push down on the top of the razor to flip the oil dispensing part out of the way, which is great for getting smaller areas, or if you don&#x27;t want too much oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another thing is the grip, its much nicer than any other disposable I&#x27;ve used, usually they are all plastic and get kinda slippery, but these have a nice rubberized grip and I have yet to drop one. All in all these razors are now my favorite disposables and I highly recommend them to anyone who has problems with dry skin/smoothness and or just needs an all around good disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample of this product as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of these from Bzzagent to try. I&#x27;ve usually shaved with an electric razor and just embraced a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I do like this razor and the gel feature is nice (though it&#x27;s a little too overbearing). It does seem to last longer than other products that have a gel feature that dries out quickly. The razors seem to be good quality and I&#x27;ve only used it twice but it seems like they&#x27;ll last quite some time. I was worried that with 5 blades I would get cut (which is what usually happens when I use a 5 blade instead of 3) but that wasn&#x27;t the case with this razor. 4 out of 5 stars from me, mainly for concerns of cost and the gel being a little too much for me but definitely a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the model of razor (not Schick) for years and I&#x27;ve been content with them, though every time I shave I end up with a couple of small nicks. Nothing major - more of a nuisance. I&#x27;ve tried different shaving gels, creams, lotions, oils, etc but there are two spots on my cheek and neck that somehow love to snag a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a pack of these Schick Hydros as part of a free promo from BzzAgent a few weeks ago and I&#x27;m really impressed with them. Since I started using these I haven&#x27;t gotten cut a single time. Literally not one. I figured all razors were pretty much the same but these disposables convinced me otherwise. Once the samples are done I&#x27;ll be happy to pay for them. I know this sounds like an ad but I really am impressed. (Don&#x27;t believe me? Ask my friends at work - they&#x27;re getting tired of hearing &amp;#34;look! no nicks today either!&amp;#34; every morning.  Maybe I should stop doing that now...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re perfectly happy with your current razor you should buy a pack of these and try them.  And even if you do like yours why not try these?</li>
    <li> These razors are great. You can use them for a vacation or every day. They left my face feeling smooth, clean, and well hydrated. I really recommend these razors!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Schick Hydro 5 to test for being a BzzAgent After using the Hydro 5s for a week I noticed the 5 blade system gave a great shave by having to shave with less verticle strokes per area of my face. If your looking for a blade that performs twice as good as others, then I recommend these Hydro 5 blades to you.</li>
    <li> Love the five blades that flip up and can be used as a trimmer.  I also love the gel! Best razor I have ever used! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Used this a few weeks now and it&#x27;s smooth and cuts very close.  So smooth that I dont feel any pain when i use it. My face feels like baby&#x27;s butt after the shave. The quality is very nice, doesn&#x27;t feel like disposable ones. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and it still cuts like new.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s not very \\&quot;green\\&quot; of me, but I love the fact that this is three razors, and not a razor handle with three sets of heads. Lets be honest, it&#x27;s just easier and it feels fresher. A clean razor head just doesn&#x27;t feel like a clean razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hydrating gel is kind of odd. If you don&#x27;t like it, fear now because it won&#x27;t last as long as the razor itself. This is a good product but there isn&#x27;t really anything it that is much improved beyond other similarly priced razors.</li>
