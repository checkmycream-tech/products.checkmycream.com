### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
      <li>I used it every day of my 13 day trip to Ireland and France and it worked perfectly.  </li>
      <li>and it worked great!  </li>
      <li>It did an excellent job straightening my thick-course hair.</li>
      <li>This was an awesome hair straightener and the dual voltage worked perfect in Turkey.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>And lastly, I absolutely love that I got all these things for under $35!!!</li>
      <li>I bought 2 identical irons (1 for me, one for my friend), and while my iron was ok, my friend&#x27;s iron did not even heat up!!!</li>
      <li>and I LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase, it gets used every morning!</li>
      <li>It is not as great as a CHI</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the way this iron treats my hair.</li>
      <li>They also stated that more than 90% of irons returned as defective are, in fact, \\&quot;perfectly fine.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s good if you are going to use it temporarily or once in a while.</li>
      <li>Still needs its kinks worked out and a good dose of quality</li>
      <li>You just plug it in and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
      <li>Value for price is good.</li>
      <li>but this does a dang good job for the price.  </li>
      <li>This iron is close to being as good as the ones at four times the price.</li>
      <li>However I&#x27;m one that leans toward good deals, so I decided to give this one a shot.  </li>
      <li>For the price I paid I was not expecting it to be as good as it is.</li>
      <li>And I loved the customer service.</li>
      <li>I came across this one and loved the reviews, however I was hesitant because I&#x27;d never heard of U9</li>
      <li>This iron straightens even faster than the Chi,and I absolutely love my Chi!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this straightener!</li>
      <li>and I love it!  </li>
      <li>I had never heard of this brand, but decided to take a chance because of the amazing deal.</li>
      <li>Works very well; best price for what I needed.</li>
      <li>so I liked that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean and great</li>
      <li>So far it is in the best of shape.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very fine</li>
      <li>This is a very comfortable iron I recommend to everyone.</li>
      <li>but, when she moved away, quite pleased with the result.  </li>
      <li>Also, please make sure you use a heat protector on your hair.</li>
      <li>this has an auto-shutoff timer, which would also make me feel better about it.</li>
      <li>ok  when we go overseas.  </li>
      <li>, I love that it&#x27;s dual voltage</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s just one more thing to pack.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, most of the voltage converters I looked at stated that they cannot be used with hair straighteners.  </li>
      <li>It can sure hit up in no time</li>
      <li>Rusk is much better</li>
      <li>I also found that many of the voltage converters were in the $30 price range, so it just made more sense to look at dual voltage appliances.  </li>
      <li>I tried many times to straighten my hair when it was damp and it did not work.</li>
      <li>You are supposed to be able to straighten your hair in under 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I went with this straightener.  </li>
      <li>I still like my CHI better</li>
      <li>but I tend to set it and make sure it is facing the inside of my palm, away from my thumb</li>
      <li>However, the switch placement could be better.  </li>
      <li>The flat iron worked beautifully!</li>
      <li>So far it has worked out beautifully.</li>
      <li>This U9 is so much cheaper than Chi yet as good or better in quality in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d seen the reviews for other U9 models and - if it weren&#x27;t for Amazon&#x27;s excellent A to Z Guarantee might not have bought this unit based on those alone.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really easy to adjust.</li>
      <li>It heats very quickly, and does the job that I bought it to do without difficulty.</li>
      <li>and it heated up and then also cooled very quickly after being unplugged.</li>
      <li>This flatiron hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair &amp; it&#x27;s really easy to make curls with.</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;ve now owned this item for over a year, and it is still going strong.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>It worked great over in Europe with my adaptor plug, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, other than if it came with a case to put it in!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the best flat iron out there, but It was exactly what I needed - dual voltage for use in Europe.  </li>
      <li>makes the iron look cheap, but if you don&#x27;t mind that, then it&#x27;s ok)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am always happy to make a hit for my kids when buying them gifts and this was a definite~ YES..high five!</li>
      <li>If something does, it was so cheap</li>
      <li>This flatiron is sooooo smooth.</li>
      <li>I like straightening it to get the smooth look.</li>
      <li>I use this at 360 degrees, of the available 450.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a hokey system that I don&#x27;t feel secure about.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, this is as good as my old CHI straightener - for a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>in all, it&#x27;s a good iron for its price range, but I&#x27;ve definitely seen better.</li>
      <li>Supposedly this flat iron should smooth out fly</li>
      <li>Great flat iron!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the idea is that there should be some sort of holes or vents at the sides of the plates to prevent this from happening, but not so with this one.  </li>
      <li>Made it feel soft &amp; smooth, and took care of the static like a pro!</li>
      <li>I originally ordered it for my upcoming Europe trip - since it features Dual Voltage -</li>
      <li>I think her rant about rating manipulation is the pot calling the kettle black, as my grandmother (who grew up when both were made of cast-iron) used to say.</li>
      <li>I contacted the seller to ask how to set the voltage on it and he replied very quickly and gave me the information I needed right away.  </li>
      <li>The reviews for this product seemed good enough.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if this boast is simply for the fact that it&#x27;s supposed to do a good job of maintaining it&#x27;s heat; which it seemed to do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved the reviews on this and decided to try it especially for 30 something dollars.  </li>
      <li>It smells so good and my hair stylist used it on me last year.</li>
      <li>I really liked this when I used it in the States, however, the 3rd time I used it in London (with a converter), it began to make a buzzing noise and heated up very quickly.</li>
      <li>but it made my hair super super curly.</li>
      <li>I can straighten my hair quickly</li>
      <li>I love the digital display, I love that it goes up to 450 degrees</li>
      <li>Being a hairdresser we buy expensive tools that are top quality and work the best.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying this and the service is an outstanding one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve ultimately ordered a Babyliss for around 50 right here on Amazon, here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q5E6JY/ref&#x3D;oh_o00_s00_i00_details  I anticipate being quite happy with it as a listing for the same model number happens to be the most well reviewed straightener on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And the price...if you want a straight iron this is it!!</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced nd works fine.</li>
      <li>I did not have a lot of money to spend and this straightener was available for a reasonable price, with the added advantage that it has dual voltage.</li>
      <li>Yeah, I tried that and would warn anyone considering this that you&#x27;re going to be scalded if you start at the roots, as I think most would naturally want to do.  </li>
      <li>I liked that you could digitally change the temperature setting and its sleek design.</li>
      <li>This flat iron still takes me about 15 or more minutes to get my hair semi smooth.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to leave my iron home and hope I can find one that works well in another country, I love the white color, I love that it just glides down my hair so smoothly and leaves it looking shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>When it arrived in country, I washed my hair and used it right away.</li>
      <li>The cord is really long too which has come in handy.</li>
      <li>Hands down, this is the BEST Flat Iron in</li>
      <li>it arrived in approx 30 hours with Prime Shipping - SUPER fast.</li>
      <li>It worked perfectly, was easy to hold and carry due to its slightly smaller size and left the hair shiny.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love my Tourmaline flat iron! I travel a lot for work outside the U.S. and have burned out expensive flat irons claiming to be dual voltage, so I was apprehensive when I first tried out the 450F in Barcelona. I was especially concerned when I didn&#x27;t see a switch to change the voltage. But I took a leap of faith and plugged in my flat iron into the adapter and crossed my fingers. The flat iron worked beautifully! The temperature was consistent with what I was used to in the U.S..</li>
    <li> Straightener is ok, not great at wet to dry but hoping dual voltage works ok  when we go overseas.  Value for price is good.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I have extremely curly hair, my previous straight iron was a $200. Chi. This iron straightens even faster than the Chi,and I absolutely love my Chi! And the price...if you want a straight iron this is it!!</li>
    <li> First off, this review is from the prospective of a man.  I have a lot of cowlicks and, recently, my hair dresser used a straight iron in a few spots after hearing me gripe about my perpetual hat head.  I was a little nervous but, when she moved away, quite pleased with the result.  Naturally, I had to try it out at home, but I was sure all the drug store ones were crap, so I bought this U9 on Amazon based completely on the bells and whistles.  I&#x27;d seen the reviews for other U9 models and - if it weren&#x27;t for Amazon&#x27;s excellent A to Z Guarantee might not have bought this unit based on those alone.  However, the reviews weren&#x27;t too bad for the white model, so I took the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast (I do have Student Prime).  My first impression of the product was that, at least, it didn&#x27;t look unbearably girly.  Then I noticed the crack on a circular white plastic piece towards the hinge... just a hairline fracture but - alas - on a moving part.  Then there was the plus button (for raising the heat).  It seemed loosely held in place only by the white plastic of the body, not by virtue of anything behind it.  It took an effort just to get it situated straight and would fall out of place just as soon as you moved the thing again, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s the claim that this is a wet to dry straightening iron.  Yeah, I tried that and would warn anyone considering this that you&#x27;re going to be scalded if you start at the roots, as I think most would naturally want to do.  I&#x27;m pretty sure the idea is that there should be some sort of holes or vents at the sides of the plates to prevent this from happening, but not so with this one.  I&#x27;m wondering if this boast is simply for the fact that it&#x27;s supposed to do a good job of maintaining it&#x27;s heat; which it seemed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, all the other listed features such as floating plates, high heat, digital display, etc seemed to be present.  The one thing that I would say regarding the buttons is that there is no lock function, as there seems to be with other, more well considered models out there.  This could be dangerous or just plain frustrating depending on which way you might inadvertently crank the temperature.  If it weren&#x27;t for my other complaints, something like that might have been worth getting used to, but the thing is more of a concept straightening iron.  Still needs its kinks worked out and a good dose of quality added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ultimately ordered a Babyliss for around 50 right here on Amazon, here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q5E6JY/ref&#x3D;oh_o00_s00_i00_details  I anticipate being quite happy with it as a listing for the same model number happens to be the most well reviewed straightener on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Just purchased this straightener the other day.. it arrived in approx 30 hours with Prime Shipping - SUPER fast. It did an excellent job straightening my thick-course hair. Made it feel soft &amp; smooth, and took care of the static like a pro! In my opinion, this is as good as my old CHI straightener - for a fraction of the cost. Definitely recommended! I originally ordered it for my upcoming Europe trip - since it features Dual Voltage - but I think this will become my everyday go-to styler! Hopefully it can perform as well with the English weather...</li>
    <li> This was an awesome hair straightener and the dual voltage worked perfect in Turkey. I liked that you could digitally change the temperature setting and its sleek design. All in all, it&#x27;s a great product! No complaints!</li>
    <li> The reviews for this product seemed good enough. I figured since I rarely straighten my hair that I wouldn&#x27;t need something super fancy or expensive. Supposedly this flat iron should smooth out fly aways?...Not on my head. You are supposed to be able to straighten your hair in under 10 minutes. I have straight hair to begin with. I like straightening it to get the smooth look. This flat iron still takes me about 15 or more minutes to get my hair semi smooth. and, it was advertised that your hair should stay straight throughout the day. My hair becomes frizzy after an hour or so. No amount of product or conditioning sprays helps either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would spend my money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my daughters trip to Europe. It worked perfectly, was easy to hold and carry due to its slightly smaller size and left the hair shiny. Great product!</li>
    <li> I had this straightener sent to my daughter at college. Although I had previously purchased her a $90.00 straightener a few years back, she likes this one far better and says that it makes her long thick hair look really healthy. I am always happy to make a hit for my kids when buying them gifts and this was a definite~ YES..high five!</li>
    <li> 1 bought this white U9 iron for keratin treatments, because it reaches 450 degrees fahrenheit.&lt;br /&gt;I am asian, with semi wavy (not curly) hair, medium textured (not fine or coarse)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The iron reached 450 degrees fahrenheit in less than a minute&lt;br /&gt;- Its digital display allows you to set the iron to an exact temperature&lt;br /&gt;- It took only 1-2 passes to straighten my hair&lt;br /&gt;- It can be used for curling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I bought 2 identical irons (1 for me, one for my friend), and while my iron was ok, my friend&#x27;s iron did not even heat up!!! they should test the irons before shipping. bad, bad, bad.&lt;br /&gt;- The temperature buttons are positioned in the same place your fingers hold it, so i kept accidentally pressing the buttons and changing the temperature! Other irons have a locking mechanism to prevent these kinds of accidents, but this one does not.&lt;br /&gt;- This iron is PAINTED. and the paint near the plates chip off, especially when the iron is hot. Which is quite annoying if you want your stuff to look new or perfect (chipped paint makes the iron look cheap, but if you don&#x27;t mind that, then it&#x27;s ok)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a mitsukoshi iron (Japanese brand) that makes the hair look super shiny. This one can tend to dry the hair out especially when used with very high temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a good iron for its price range, but I&#x27;ve definitely seen better.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this brand, but decided to take a chance because of the amazing deal. It served me well! I am a hair stylist and needed a flat iron that went to 450 degrees for the Brazilian blow out teatment. So far it has worked out beautifully. The plate has gotten a little brown from product, but I haven&#x27;t tryed to clean it ...and honestly, it really doesn&#x27;t bother me. haha. Definately has made life easier because I only do 1 or 2 passes instead of several.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair so i needed a straightener that went to a very low temperature. I did accidentally click on the buttons while straightening my hair but you just got to watch where you put your hands. I tried many times to straighten my hair when it was damp and it did not work. i dont know if i was doing something wrong but it made my hair super super curly.</li>
    <li> So far it is in the best of shape.  It can sure hit up in no time and I like that I can adjust the temperature.  It amazes me that it can heat to such heat in hardly any time. I do recomen it to others and hope they like it as well as I do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on hair flat-irons, this is my first. This heats up really quickly, it has a digital display which you can watch to see the temperature zooming up.  I use this at 360 degrees, of the available 450. My hair is very fine so I use it with Nexxus heat protector.  What I DO like:  It&#x27;s clean and great *looking* design.  The annoyingly long cord swivels all the way around easily, which helps. My hair stays styled all day.  Today, my husband actually commented on my hair without my probing him, so, that&#x27;s pleasing.  What I do NOT like: First of all, how can you hold it to flatten your hair??  You end up turning it off, or raising the temperature because of the placement of the buttons. So awkward to hold it between just 2 fingers, in an exact placement, when you&#x27;re looking backwards in a mirror and tripping over the excess cord!  Urgh! Worst: Seriously - the bottom isn&#x27;t flat, which makes it hard to keep it stable on the countertop, or keep it from rolling to the side, this seems dangerous to me because the heat travels through the sides. I spend too much time trying to keep this thing from rolling &amp; burning down my bathroom, or through its own cord.  And I don&#x27;t like swearing so much before I even make it out of the house.  Yes, I am able to use the cord to help stabilize it, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to and overall, it&#x27;s a hokey system that I don&#x27;t feel secure about. I would have bought one with a stable bottom, had I known.  I don&#x27;t *think* this has an auto-shutoff timer, which would also make me feel better about it. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll go through the hassle of returning this but I do think if you can find a safer one, you should.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron! It&#x27;s dual wattage so it will work anywhere!</li>
    <li> it worked wonders for my fiance hair. i highly suggest you buy this straightner. so if ur looking for ur to look professional done then purchase this item</li>
    <li> This is a very comfortable iron I recommend to everyone.I ordered this on Friday and got it by Tuesday.The cord is really long and adjustable making it very comfortable to use.This wont dry or fry your hair since the plates are very delicate to hair.The price is the most reasonable Ive seen for being wet to dry also is more worthy than all other brands Ive used.I highly recommend buying this and the service is an outstanding one.Only be careful since you can burn your hands a little with it,only one bad thing about but above all is truly truly worth having and its performance is really satisfying.100% WORTH BUYING.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the market for a flat iron. When I purchase an item like a flat iron, if it works really well, I usually fall in love and I&#x27;m hesitant about using another one etc. I have a trip to England in the next few weeks and knowing this, I was already suffering that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take my flat iron with me. So I searched for a dual voltage iron.  I came across this one and loved the reviews, however I was hesitant because I&#x27;d never heard of U9 and I have no need for a wet to dry iron. But I did want one that went up to 450 degrees so I liked that. But for some reason I just couldn&#x27;t get past the price. I feel like with flat irons you really do get what you pay for. However I&#x27;m one that leans toward good deals, so I decided to give this one a shot.  First let me say that the buttons are not in a weird place. To change the temperature while you&#x27;re styling you would have to literally squeeze the crap out of it. Secondly, I was a little scared about the plates being so shiny, simply because I had just bought an iron for my mom for Christmas and it was pure ceramic plates and they did not look like the ones on this iron. However, I gave it a try and I LOVE IT!!! I love the digital display, I love that it goes up to 450 degrees, I love that it&#x27;s dual voltage and I don&#x27;t have to leave my iron home and hope I can find one that works well in another country, I love the white color, I love that it just glides down my hair so smoothly and leaves it looking shiny and healthy. And I loved the customer service. I contacted the seller to ask how to set the voltage on it and he replied very quickly and gave me the information I needed right away.  And lastly, I absolutely love that I got all these things for under $35!!! If for some reason it gets fried in England I will add to this review... but considering how well it has worked so far, I highly doubt something will go wrong. If something does, it was so cheap I can just get another one. However... I&#x27;m anticipating being able to love this iron for at least 2 or 3 years.  Also, please make sure you use a heat protector on your hair. I recommend Redken Heat Glide. It smells so good and my hair stylist used it on me last year. I bought it recently and LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I have a favorite brand of Flat Iron that I normally buy for both work and personal use. Being a hairdresser we buy expensive tools that are top quality and work the best. This iron was for a trip out of the country so I wanted one that would work well for this short trip.It needed to have voltage compatible for foreign countries with the different voltage needs. This one adjusts itself when plugged in all by itself. It was a no brainer to use. For the price I paid I was not expecting it to be as good as it is. This iron is close to being as good as the ones at four times the price. I would highly recommend this iron to everyone. Hands down, this is the BEST Flat Iron in it&#x27;s price range and also in the much much higher range too.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for a trip to Europe. It works well, but I was frustrated by the location of the temperature controls. It seems impossible to avoid touching the buttons while using and I kept turning the temperature down inadvertently -ugh.</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener for a recent trip to Europe because I didn&#x27;t want to mess with voltage converters which, from the reviews I read, can be bulky and problematic.  And it&#x27;s just one more thing to pack.  Additionally, most of the voltage converters I looked at stated that they cannot be used with hair straighteners.  I also found that many of the voltage converters were in the $30 price range, so it just made more sense to look at dual voltage appliances.  I&#x27;m so glad that I went with this straightener.  There are no switches that need to be flipped in order to use it with 240 volts vs. 120 volts.  You just plug it in and you&#x27;re good to go.  I used it every day of my 13 day trip to Ireland and France and it worked perfectly.  It heats up extremely fast, 5 seconds or less.  I have long, thick, curly hair and this straightener really works well on my hair.  I can straighten my hair quickly and I don&#x27;t have to go over it twice like I&#x27;ve had to with other straighteners.  I&#x27;ve even used this on my hair while it was damp and it worked great!  I now use it every day at home as my regular straightener and I love it!  I would definitely recommend this product for travel or regular use.  Now I have 1 straightener that I can use at home and while traveling with no hassle.</li>
    <li> I needed a dual voltage for a Europe trip and this product worked very well.  It heated up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;You have to remember to punch in the heat level each time, if you forget it and just plug it in, then it will not be ready to use.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced nd works fine. The buttons are bit awkward at first and I kept accidentally shutting off the iron, but I got used them and have had no trouble. Works as well as a Chi, but costs a lot less.</li>
    <li> I am a travel agent and we travel 4-5 times a year.  I have a CHI and found that even with a converter I have almost sindged my hair off.  I loved the reviews on this and decided to try it especially for 30 something dollars.  I still like my CHI better but this does a dang good job for the price.  I have used other very expensive flat irons and have not been able to acheive the results this one does.  If you travel, even though it is dual voltage you will still need an adaptor since it has the standard american plug.  I do agree that the placement of the setting control is a little annoying but I tend to set it and make sure it is facing the inside of my palm, away from my thumb and I dont tend to hit it.  I would buy again and highly reccommend.</li>
    <li> Works very well; best price for what I needed. However, the switch placement could be better.  While using it, I inadvertently  changed the settings or turned it off. For that reason I am giving it 3 stars. Other than that shortcoming, it works well.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was all I thought it would be heats up in seconds and cools off just as quickly.  It worked great over in Europe with my adaptor plug, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, other than if it came with a case to put it in!</li>
    <li> This flatiron is sooooo smooth. I have fine hair so my hair seems to get caught in flatirons a lot. This flatiron hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair &amp; it&#x27;s really easy to make curls with. B/c it&#x27;s white the plates have started to turn b/c of product but that&#x27;s too be expected. The cord is really long too which has come in handy. The degree buttons are placed where you would proabably grip the iron &amp; sometimes I change the dregree but it&#x27;s really easy to adjust. I&#x27;m really happy with the way this iron treats my hair.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the best flat iron out there, but It was exactly what I needed - dual voltage for use in Europe.  No problems at all and it heated up and then also cooled very quickly after being unplugged.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straightener! I was a little afraid of buying it because it was not a Remington, which has been my go to device for my hair. However, my Remington blew out and I am serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Tanzania. I did not have a lot of money to spend and this straightener was available for a reasonable price, with the added advantage that it has dual voltage. When it arrived in country, I washed my hair and used it right away. I love what it does for my hair; and it works for all types of hair(I am African American). You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for several months now, and I&#x27;m pleased with it overall. It heats very quickly, and does the job that I bought it to do without difficulty. It seems solidly made. I&#x27;d give it five stars if it weren&#x27;t for one design flaw: the buttons for turning it on and off and for adjusting the temperature have been placed right in the area where I naturally want to put my fingers or thumb when I&#x27;m using it, leading to me accidentally changing the heat setting while using it. They could have put those controls nearer to the cord end of the device, and this would not have been a problem.    Update: I&#x27;ve now owned this item for over a year, and it is still going strong. It still heats super-quickly and is always reliable. I&#x27;ve knocked it off onto the floor and accidentally spilled water on it (it&#x27;s right next to my bathroom sink), and I&#x27;ve had zero problems with it. I&#x27;m more convinced than ever that the person who wrote that review about it falling apart and shocking someone on the first use is full of it. I think her rant about rating manipulation is the pot calling the kettle black, as my grandmother (who grew up when both were made of cast-iron) used to say.</li>
    <li> I really liked this when I used it in the States, however, the 3rd time I used it in London (with a converter), it began to make a buzzing noise and heated up very quickly. Then it made scary probably-going-to-set-on-fire-soon noises, so I unplugged it, and now it won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
    <li> I have a CHI, I bought this because I&#x27;m traveling. It is not as great as a CHI but it&#x27;s good if you are going to use it temporarily or once in a while.</li>
    <li> I bought this U9 Ceramic Flat Iron before I moved to the UK.  I got a chance to use it in both US and UK, and so far it&#x27;s been working great.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s durable, heats up/cools down pretty quickly.  You can even see the temperature in °C or °F (just switch back and forth by clicking the + and - buttons together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was replacing my old Chi.  This U9 is so much cheaper than Chi yet as good or better in quality in my opinion.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get caught between the plates like I used to with Chi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in white and looks very stylish, not a typical color for a hair straighter.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase, it gets used every morning!</li>
    <li> it heats up fast and the handles get heated outside as well, so sometimes you have to be careful not to burn yourself, and also i have to go trough several strokes before my hair is straight, but then i&#x27;m Indian and have thick course hair.</li>
    <li> Normal hair straightner. Your hair will sizzle if you use this on damp hair. I dont think its a wet to dry tool.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a trip abroad, this iron did not heat at all.  In spite of a blinking display that indicated it was heating, after five minutes it was still stone cold.&lt;br /&gt;This may be due to an unnecessarily complicated user interface and inadequate directions - but three of us tried and could not get the iron to heat up.  The company made some suggestions which we tried - to no avail.  They also stated that more than 90% of irons returned as defective are, in fact, \\&quot;perfectly fine.\\&quot;  It seems to me that if that many people are unable to make this iron function, for whatever reason, then something is seriously amiss.</li>
    <li> Ok. Not amazing. Rusk is much better</li>
</ol>
