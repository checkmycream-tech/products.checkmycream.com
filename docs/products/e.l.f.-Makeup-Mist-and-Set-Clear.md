<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was a gift and she loved it</li>
    <li> The best makeup setting spray! Love this stuff and would recommend to anyone that wants their makeup to last all day! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product to set your makeup! Great price</li>
    <li> IDK. I have had this a few months. I have used it a few times. I use bare minerals. I find it like washes it off or fades. I don&#x27;t know if it &amp;#34;water proofs&amp;#34; or makes my make up last longer. I will not order again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! My makeup lasted up to 8 hours! Thank you again for the fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I honestly did not notice any benefit of wearing this and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I guess the price was nice but really it didn&#x27;t do anything good for me. At all. Recently, my skin got really dry and moisturizing products have made me look shiny despite a lack of oil. So, thought I would try this. If anything, it made my skin dryer and increased the amount of settling by my concealer into fine lines. It did nothing good. Didn&#x27;t really dig the scent, either.</li>
    <li> This product is a good for setting your makeup and keeping it in place. This product makes my eyeshadow and concealer last longer. However, after couple hours (around 5-6 hours) my concealer will start wearing off but that&#x27;s okay. The smell is not that pleasant. It has a smell kind of like alcohol pads. The product is difficult to aim your face with. Sometimes i would accidently spray it on my hair or neck because im not used to spraying with my eyes closed. The product, once sprayed, would dry up in about 10 seconds which i like.</li>
    <li> It makes.my skin feel dewy and I love the fact ig really works especially with my eyebrows. I will buy again</li>
    <li> Works ok. Witch Hazel just as good</li>
    <li> Great product, would have given 5 stars but it has a little bit of an odd scent. It does a great job of setting makeup, but I haven&#x27;t decided yet if it is a necessary product, or if it just makes me feel better about the staying power of my make up. I purchased the e.l.f. finishing powder at the same time and that is amazing and may very well be doing the job itself. But this feels great and it does feel like it &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; everything. I would recommend this...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have high expectations but it really does set makeup and makeup stays put through the workday.</li>
    <li> This spray sets ur makeup do pretty!!</li>
    <li> First timer....I sprayed it once to see how far away I needed to hold the bottle from my face. I think I did at least 12 inches and I liked it. I would give it five stars but some other face misters I have used had a finer mist. If you hold this one too close you are going to get wet.</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail 2 days ago.  So far, I&#x27;ve used it once and my makeup stayed on all day and looked nice.</li>
    <li> This is a good makeup setter.  The only reason for not 5 stars is that it sometimes comes out as more than a mist.  There will be drops of liquid sitting on my face so I have to wait until they completely dry to do anything.  It does not seem to mess with the makeup at all though.</li>
    <li> Must did ok, irritated my eyes</li>
    <li> Amazing.. Is a must have.</li>
    <li> Tried it, just don&#x27;t feel like it works. Leaves a funny film on the face until it dries up.</li>
    <li> Elf sports a terrific price point. No one can argue with that. I&#x27;ve tried several products in the line and many are notable - certainly for the price. It seems Elf is getting a lot of attention - I&#x27;m sure due to budget conscious consumers. I would not say it is a fantastic line, but it&#x27;s certainly an option. I recommend that you try a couple of products and judge it for yourselves. If you&#x27;re used to a couture line you won&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;A major benefit of this formula is it contains aloe, green tea, cucumber and Vitamins A, C and E as key ingredients. That&#x27;s cool and should serve to protect the skin against free radicals. Another good selling point is, although the bottle is small, it should last quite a while because it doesn&#x27;t take much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I do not use a setting mist often, but I needed something for a play. I have to say elf worked comparably well. My makeup seemed to last longer and there was less transfer onto my costume, although it certainly does not solve that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: I read some reviews that said it made people&#x27;s makeup too wet and run. &amp;#34;Hello?&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not a shower. Hold it farther away from your face (about a foot 1/2 to two feet.) AND, turn your head frequently. You don&#x27;t need to bathe in it to get the benefit. By holding the spray an appropriate distance away from my face, it became a little damp -  but only for about 10 seconds. In doing so, it had no negative effects on my makeup whatsoever. There are many mists on the market, but most are more expensive. Lastly, elf smells a tad bit funky, but it&#x27;s not that bad. And, you only smell it for a couple of seconds. Also, it feels a bit sticky after some hours, but it is a sealer. I suppose that indicates it is fulfilling its purpose. I would recommend giving it a try as an inexpensive alternative.</li>
    <li> Great no strong smell and feels light</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is very light! I am so pleased with this product. I will purchase it again for sure!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t say it sets all my makeup. Yes to foundation yes to eye shadow no to mascara no to lipstick</li>
    <li> does good to make the makeup not look so cakeyy, but as far as so the makeup wont transfer to clothes or ect. it still the same as if you didn&#x27;t wear it. would i re order...no probably try something new.</li>
    <li> So good better than M.A.C</li>
    <li> I love this product and will buy it again. I wear younique makeup and it usually wears off throughout the day. This product keeps it all in place.</li>
    <li> Spray was awesome long lasting</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the hype is about these fnishing sprays but I am not impressed and do not see a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It keeps your makeup from looking cakey when you&#x27;re done. You guys should definitely buy it.</li>
    <li> I dont know if this product works as a &amp;#34;set-ter&amp;#34; but it definitely works as a &amp;#34;mist-er&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching thsi really pretty girl on a you tube tutorial apply this as a finishing touch with a flourish, I decided I needed it too. After all if it could do wonders for her, it could probably work a miracle on me. Thus, when this product arrived I hastily put on my full make-up just like the girl in the video had demonstrated and ended the routine of 32 items with a flourish with the elf mist and set, even though I had no where to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did get dewy and moist which made me feel like a 13 year old girl, albeit with a fully made up face, and at the end of the day my make up remained pretty intact, except for the lipstick which I had to re-apply after lunch. And I did end up going out, if a trip to the USPS store counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 month of owning it, I realized that I don&#x27;t use it regularly and the main reason is because it was never a part of my make up routine (which initially consisted of washing my face and later evolved into wash face and apply lipstick), but every now and then when I do put on a lot of make up I use it to set my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I will start using it more. Maybe even without makeup !!</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t see a difference between using the elf finishing spray and not using it.  My make up wore the same and looked the same.  Not sure what the intended purpose was because I just didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, for price. No nasty chemical smell or feel. Dries fast, and makeup stays smudge free, despite lots of action and sweating. Purchasing direct from the company site, is the best way to go.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to say, I don&#x27;t see any difference on how long makeup stays on.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> It doesnt seem to set my makeup.. It looks good for an hour or two before I need to touch things back up.</li>
    <li> Awesome for long wear.</li>
    <li> not sure it this works as suppose to</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for some people but it doesn&#x27;t work for me; I wouldn&#x27;t call it a bad product, but I don&#x27;t like using it after my makeup, I think it works better for ME when I use it after I put lotion on before putting on foundation and such, it gives me a better place to start.</li>
    <li> My makeup would rub off and this also doesn&#x27;t give a matte look. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars is because of the price. You get what you pay for though. I use urban decay de slick now</li>
    <li> Bottle leaked all over</li>
    <li> did not work well with clown make up</li>
    <li> Tried it for the first time and surprisingly my make up stayed for the time I needed my make up on. I was out in the sun and I did not see my foundation fade away with the usual sweat and oil. It has no scent but overall extremely satisfied with the this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel SO sticky!! I always have a problem with my makeup staying on and really wanted this to work. Spraying it is not a problem, but as soon as its on my face, I feel greasy and feel the need to wash my face immediately. It also dilutes the look of my makeup as soon as its applied (my eye makeup is lighter and my blush is less visible). So, so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, no more, no less. Don&#x27;t expect 24 hours of makeup staying on, I&#x27;d say I got a good 6 hours.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it sprays as a stream much like a water gun, not a fine mist as the description suggests. Pretty disappointing...</li>
    <li> Did not make a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this so much. It is way better than setting powder! And I love the moist look afterwards. Didn&#x27;t mess up my makeup after applying it at all. A different bottle would be better but its still worth it.</li>
    <li> my friend told me about this make up i love it</li>
    <li> I love this!!! Here is a fun tip for ELF aficionados like myself: when you really want the pigment in your eyeshadows to pop, wet your brush with THIS makeup mist and set! Wetting the brush is a tried and true way to make your colors stand out, but wetting the brush with this setting spray helps the color last all through the day and night! I used this trick on a recent trip to Disney- the day began at 6:00 am and I finally came home at 11:00 pm with my eyeshadow still going strong!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff I spray it on my face after I finish my makeup and it makes my makeup stay perfect all day</li>
    <li> This makeup spray barely works. It dries out my skin and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup last. By the end of the day my makeup ends up looking dry and crusty if I use the spray. Would NOT recommend. Not even worth the price.</li>
    <li> Ive used different brands of finishing spray, including hair spray, and this one does not clog the pores or feel heavy. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works okay.. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s better ...</li>
    <li> I do not feel that this product help set my make up at all. It wore the same as it did before using it and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> its okay it helped a little but i suggest investing in a better one</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying setting spray. I can&#x27;t see spending $15-$30 on a setting spray from other brands. The package wasn&#x27;t open, or didn&#x27;t appear to be, but the bottle seemed as if some of the liquid leaked (it was sticky, but washed off with water). I discovered that the spray nozzle was broken. I just bought a travel size spray bottle from Target and it works fine. As for how the product is... doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but it dries quickly without a scent. Feels ok on my skin, but I am oily in my t-zone, and I don&#x27;t think this product really helps the make-up stay on... I refuse to use it during the day as I think it will make my face look more oily. I already use a primer, I mix 1/2 foundation with 1/2 oil of olay bb cream as a moisturizer, then use powder blush and powder to set the liquid. Honestly, I could probably go without this spray all together. Might be good for setting powder only users, because it helps reduce the &#x27;powdery&#x27; look. Also, probably good with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Wow this works amazing. I will definitely be purchasing more of this</li>
    <li> Works great for keeping the mascara from flaking.</li>
    <li> Really nice, it gives me a dewy look and my makeup does look better at the end of the day. I usually have to reapply my powder foundation in the middle of the day but with this I don&#x27;t have to reapply. I have very bad skin and can break out with almost anything after using this product for two weeks I haven&#x27;t broke out so in my opinion it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. It&#x27;s very light and not sticky on the face. Only complaint is the smell, it does have a strange scent. Other than that, I like it.</li>
    <li> Recieved it on time.Works rather well for the price. However I have oily skin so I find myself applying it 2 to 3 times a day for all day coverage.</li>
    <li> Not to sure it makes my makeup last any longer.</li>
    <li> Great stuff I like the way it moisturizes my makeup when I&#x27;m done so i don&#x27;t look dry :)</li>
    <li> The small size is perfect f I r travelling. I can&#x27;t bring my large mac products on the plane. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
    <li> I spray lightly after I finish my make up &amp; it sets it all in place&amp; smells good!</li>
    <li> Sticky and hard to open. Not worth it. You have to spray on your face</li>
    <li> awesome. my makeup lasts longer n stays fresh.love it</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I only use it sparingly on nights out but I t smells nice and has a lightweight feel. You have to be careful not to spray it too much or else it makes the makeup get runny, and let it set without smudging it. Overall a good product. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It helps keep my makeup in place all day. This product is only $3 at Walmart and on Elf&#x27;s website though .</li>
    <li> I love the mist it refreshing an sets well! I wish they just made it in a larger bottle!!! Cause I use it everyday ,specially in the summer!!☺️</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t meet all my expectations, maybe because I don&#x27;t know how n when to apply it..</li>
    <li> Horrible at &amp;#34;setting makeup&amp;#34;.  I actually use it after my face lotion to help moisturizer my face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;ve payed so much money for setting sprays. This one right here has to be one of my favorites because it is so cheap and it works just like my $30 Urban Decay setting spray.</li>
    <li> It gives you that dewy fresh look that is desired!</li>
    <li> Ive never used makeup setter before, but I am sold on this!  I am becoming obsessed with ELF products!  They are very affordable and high quality.  Granted, some are misses but most hit the nail on the head!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the items I received. Shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> I love it leaves my makeup looking so good and fresh  I use it everytime I go out. I was scared it was gonna make me breakout but it didnt at all!</li>
    <li> Kinda set my makeup, didn&#x27;t last long.. booo :(</li>
    <li> I spray it on my hands and tap it on my face to settle make up.</li>
    <li> i tried it but it did not really make my make up stay in place all day, still after the day some of my makeup was gone so idk</li>
    <li> It was leaking when it arrived. Only 3/4 of the product was left.</li>
    <li> Works well, but sadly I discovered it makes me itchy, and can no longer use it. I gave it to someone who isn&#x27;t allergic.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> this works , I love it</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!! Did a trial run and my makeup stayed in place all day! (I&#x27;m a mail carrier who is constantly dealing with the elements) it was sunny and warm and my makeup stayed on!</li>
    <li> it definitely does hold face powders on eyes and skin. don&#x27;t overuse it to avoid looking obviously powdered</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Setting spray is a must have!! If you have never tried it, I recommend you spend the $3 on this. Your makeup will stay put for hours! You just respray and it&#x27;s all refreshed again!!</li>
    <li> i absolutetly love this setting spray better than urban decay!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to my makeup collection! I use it after washing my face at night before I go to bed and after I put my makeup on in the morning. Keeps my makeup from rubbing off and around.</li>
    <li> So in love with this product. Works great as a skin moisturizer has well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it sets my make up</li>
    <li> Works great. Keeps my makeup in place all day.</li>
    <li> I received this product yesterday in the mail and as soon as it arrived I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I went on with my usual beauty routine and once I had finished my foundation, I applied the makeup mist. It works wonderfully! I would always notice some of my foundation rub off onto clothing, especially white clothes, but after using the mist the difference was definitely noticeable. No more makeup smudges!</li>
    <li> Sprays nice and does hold make up doesnt run</li>
    <li> Love this spray helps keep my make up on all day</li>
    <li> I ordered this and I fell in love! It even came 6 day&#x27;s after I ordered it. It arrived earlier then expected. The packaging sucks but this does the job for oily skin. I have extremely oily skin after two hours I&#x27;m super oily in my T zone. I sprayed this mist and set spray after I finished applying a full face at 11:00 am and not until 8:00 pm I started to get oily! I will continue to buy this for the rest of my life, it even makes my make up smooth and together.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product but it turns out I only like it. It doesnt appear to really promote any longevity in my makeup for any long period of time, and leaves the face feeling sticky. My biggest problem was the horrible smell of the spray. It stinks for a couple minutes. They should address this immediately.</li>
    <li> e.l.f. Makeup Mist and Set, Clear, 2.02 Ounce- it works to set your makeup, I do entire face first then spray all over, let it dry and it sets makeup for the entire day or night.  Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this setting spray does anything AT ALL.  I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle and I have to say that it has no redeeming qualities.  It&#x27;s mostly H2O and it makes my makeup run even if I only spritz my face once.  Besides this it does nothing to keep it fresh throughout the day.  It may be only $3 but it&#x27;s a total waste of cash.  On the positive side, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance so it&#x27;s suitable for very sensitive skin like mine (I had no reaction whatsoever, probably because it&#x27;s mostly water, lol!).  I&#x27;ve had a hit or miss experience with ELF products and the only makeup product they make that I truly love is the HD powder.  Other than that, I take a pass.  I do think the price point is right for young girls who are just beginning to experiment with makeup and have to use their allowance to outfit their makeup kit.  In that case, items that cost $1 or $3 are a pretty good resource.  However, the quality is on par with the price.  Even the HD powder is pretty much pure cornstarch although it comes in a nice container.  I am a fan of the brushes though.  The $1 eye shadow brushes are excellent and I have several that I use daily.  The $3 brushes are a slight step up and also work pretty well.  But this setting mist is a joke. If you want to pay for water with a slight fragrance, be my guest.  But if you&#x27;re looking for something that will actually improve the wearing time of makeup, try Urban Decay or NYX.  I ended up using this spray to spritz my hair in the morning.  After I used it up, I simply filled the bottle with more water and continue to use it for my cowlicks in the a.m.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste more than $3 for this product.  But even so, $3 wasted is wasted nonetheless.  I could have replaced 3 $1 ELF brushes instead, which would have been a much better purchase.  This spray is a joke.  My advice is not to waste your money.  Anyone who claims that this spray actually works is experiencing the placebo effect.  If you believe it works, it will.  That is, until you actually check your makeup in the mirror and find that it has run down your face anyway, lol!That is, until you actually check your makeup in the mirror and find that it has run down your face anyway, lol!</li>
    <li> Product might as well be water.  I noticed no difference on my face.</li>
    <li> its a very good product I have ever used</li>
    <li> This enlarged my pores and dried up my forehead</li>
    <li> This is like spraying water on your face.  It didn&#x27;t set my make up it made it run.  Waste of money and I was so excited to try to get it.  Oh well.  Life happens.</li>
    <li> i use it but im not sure how well it really works.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! It&#x27;s perfect and it makes my make-up look flawless</li>
    <li> I knew I was in need of a setting spray as soon as the summer heat started coming and I immediately started sweating all of my makeup off. I needed something that will keep at least most of it in place throughout the day. I&#x27;m a fan of e.l.f. products and have considered buying this for some time, so I finally caught it at Target ($6) and picked it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first time you use it, there is a noticeable difference in the amount of  makeup that stays on your face. When I&#x27;m out and it&#x27;s hot, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sweating my entire face off anymore. It&#x27;s good to know that I&#x27;m still retaining a decent amount of coverage even after baking in the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I wanted to know how much of a difference it actually made. I swatched my full coverage foundation on my arm and sprayed part of it with the makeup mist, and the other half without. I took a tissue and wiped my arm with medium pressure (pictured), and found that the side with the makeup mist did not make an incredible difference, but definitely a noticeable one. With a generous application of the mist, you could get away with retaining most of your makeup even after wiping your face. This alone is why I think this product is worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downfall is that it does make your face a bit shiny which may not compliment those with oily skin, but people could still rock the dewy look which works for hotter weather. Even so, I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t top it off with a matte powder after the mist has dried if you don&#x27;t like the shininess that comes with heavy application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line -- this thing isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but it is a great tool for those who want their makeup to last longer throughout the day. I&#x27;m always impressed with the quality and price of e.l.f. cosmetics and this is no exception. For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. Even if it&#x27;s not your go-to spray, it&#x27;s not a bad thing to throw in your purse or have in travel bag. Definitely glad I tried this one.ne.</li>
    <li> So I haven&#x27;t use it as much but so far its good.</li>
    <li> Hmmmm... my makeup lasted the same amount of time it usually does before using this product.  I even used it with the HD setting powder before hand... I&#x27;m going to give it more time since I really want this to work. Let&#x27;s see if it will last thru my work night tomorrow. .. in a hot sticky warehouse lol  Ok so I must add that I for sure could tell the difference using thus vs not using this. My makeup was fresh and flawless at first break AND lunch! It still looks pretty good now after a 8 hour work shift.  In a hot sticky sweaty warehouse that&#x27;s muggy and humid. Works miracles.  Definitely a keeper..</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure if this would even work for preserving my makeup, but it does!</li>
    <li> I loved how my face look after I used the makeup mist ♡♡ is really nice and keep my makeup all day ((: I just loved I really recommended ♡♡</li>
    <li> Well other the spraying your face with water or what it says it is, I saw NO difference to my make up it was as it was, This did not freshen up my make up, just misted my face.</li>
    <li> Really helps to keep makeup in place.</li>
    <li> Gives makeup a nice finish. Keeps my makeup looking fresh all day. I AM extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for less than it sells in stores and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I tried it out last night and my makeup stayed put!</li>
    <li> Bought two of these one for myself the other for my daughter, we simply love it.</li>
    <li> This has been compared to MAC Studio Fix Set and it did the job for me, and it saved me about 20 bucks. 20 bucks that I can spend on better things at Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love it , it sets the make up real nice but it&#x27;s either my face is greasy or the setting mist is greasy but I still like it</li>
    <li> Okay, so for the price this product is pretty decent. This is my first try with this sort of product so I didnt know what to expect. I used about 3-4 spritz to ensure even coverage. My liquid foundation stayed on longer than usual cuz of this product, but it definitely didn&#x27;t hold all day, I had to touch up and spritz again although I have very oily skin so for those of you who dont, this product should last all day.</li>
    <li> I dont think it works</li>
    <li> Does not hold makeup very good. I set it by 7:00 am and by 1:00 pm, not doing any exercise, just being at work sitting down in an office, foundation wears out. Mist is not fine, very big droplets.</li>
    <li> its okay but not of good quality</li>
    <li> This spray saves me a lot of time with clean up and reapplying make up when I&#x27;m out for the day - it sets make up very well! My only wish is that it were matte, because I sometimes have oily skin and this makes my cheekbones and forehead a little shiny, but I remedy that by putting a little powder on top.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of e.l.f. products simply because they are inexpensive and seem to get the job done. I have never used a setting mist before, but the humidity this year has been a bummer so I thought I would give it a try. I like how it smells, it&#x27;s not strong at all, it dries quickly, and it gives your face a pretty dewy look. And yes, it did keep my make up on all day. By the time I washed my face at about 10:00 pm, I still had full mascara and eye shadow on. That never happens. Great product, and if you don&#x27;t like it, it only cost a few dollars.</li>
    <li> it feels like water..... and im not sure if its even working considering most of my makeup is high end</li>
    <li> I am trying to get into wearing makeup and this product was rated as the best for setting your foundation.  I am loving it thus far and was priced just right!</li>
    <li> the set mist works pretty well but to doesn&#x27;t necessarily hold for the entire day. it holds for like 3/4 of the day, but I also use regular makeup so if you use this with long last makeup them I feel that it should last you all day. A simple product that works well but not the best that I have ever seen.</li>
    <li> Works well my makeup stays looking great for 8+ hours with this</li>
    <li> I live in a SW desert area where one sweats, not perspires &amp; this stuff really has done a great job at keeping my makeup looking good &amp; keeps it from melting down my face. About ready to buy my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This does not come out in a mist. It&#x27;s literally like squirting yourself in the face with a bottle of cleaner. It works fine to help makeup stay on but I had to spritz my face and then smooth it out because there were literal drops of liquid on it. I&#x27;m going back to Fix Plus.</li>
    <li> Really good setting spray, makes make up (especially powder) look flawless and not cakey. 4 stars because it has a very very very slight... (organic?) smell.</li>
    <li> I got this earlier than expected! Which is great! I wear a lot of liquid makeup followed with mineral makeup and fake eyelashes, eyeliner and all the good stuff! But by the end of the day it would get oily and nasty and I just wanted to take my makeup off! I got this stuff and it was really keeping my makeup stay on from the morning till nighttime so about 10 hours! It&#x27;s so great!</li>
    <li> This is a great light weight finishing spray. It dries pretty fast and help my makeup last all day.</li>
    <li> Love this mist and set it really gets the job done</li>
    <li> This stuff keeps your makeup on, but 5 minutes after spraying it, my face will look oily. I have to put powder in top of mist.</li>
    <li> Really good seettjng spray. My makeup lasted way longer and its very cheap!</li>
    <li> Great price and great product!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! My makeup sets pretty good and lasts all day</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using a setting spray and I am happy that I tried it.  After using the spray I noticed that my makeup stayed on longer and looked fresh all day.  I also noticed that it made my skin look dewy without making it oily.  In fact, my face stayed oil-free throughout the day.  My only complaint about the spray is that it can come out unevenly, leaving some areas somewhat saturated and others completely dry.  I notice that this is a problem even when I hold the spray 12-16 inches from my face; however, if I gently dab my face with a tissue after applying the spray, it seems to even out the application.  Overall, the price is right and this is a product that I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Holds my pack all day. I just don&#x27;t like the smell. Overall it&#x27;s decent and a good price. 4 stars because of the smell</li>
    <li> My daughter liked this.  She said it worked great.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the urban decay setting spray I used is getting too expensive. I had a horrible allergic reaction to it (at the end of the day) with itchy welts all over my face. Tried it again just to be sure and same reaction. I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin - but just be careful and do a test spot before spraying it all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that I had a reaction, my make up stayed in place pretty well.</li>
    <li> e.l.f. products are often paraben free, so I took a chance on ordering this.  Unfortunately, it does contain parabens.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday, but when I do I love it. It makes your skin not too sticky and makes your makeup last all day. It has a refreshing smell. The only complaint I have is that the spray and bottle does not work as well as I would like. This is a close comparison to the Urban Decay-Up All Night setting spray. I would pick this over the UD one any day. It&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
    <li> This does absolutely nothing for me. I sprayed it this morning before going out and every time I dabbed my mouth, the napkin came away with half of my foundation. I just brushed some hair away from my face while surfing amazon and my fingers came away with makeup on them! I don&#x27;t even wear much makeup! It sprayed very unevenly, which might have been part of the problem, but the bottle is not very well made at all, spraying some areas with big drops and others not at all. I tried spraying it on again later in the day, but my makeup is still coming off at every touch.</li>
    <li> Great product-great price.</li>
    <li> Best spray ever!!! Only thing I&#x27;ve found that will set my makeup and stop it from rubbing off, especially while wearing sunglasses! I would remove my sunglasses and have bare patches on the bridge of my nose where my makeup would rub off, but I mist my face with the mist and set, it doesn&#x27;t budge!! GREAT stuff!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. I wore a white blazer and my makeup stayed put.</li>
    <li> Works really day, my makeup lasted a whole 11 hours, with my blush, bronzer still intact. I would recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s great for the price. I want to say that sometimes the negative reviews can be deceiving, but it up to the individual to figure out what works best for them. This product worked amazing for me, the distribution was even, and how the contents sprayed out wasnt a problem. Just try it out for yourself!</li>
    <li> its ok.  i didn&#x27;t really see a big difference</li>
    <li> Went to a music festival and my eye makeup stayed on ALL DAY. Multiple women camped around me were really impressed with its staying power. I love that I can put on my eye makeup in the morning, wear sunglasses all day, and have my makeup all ready for the evening underneath!  I usually find that my eye shadow creases a little and my liner smudges throughout a normal work day even with eyelid primer, but this has alleviated those issues. I&#x27;m not a particularly sweaty person, so I can&#x27;t speak for how it holds up with lots of sweat, although the sweat that builds up under my sunglasses hasn&#x27;t caused any issues. It doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent my concealer from creasing, but that might just be because my concealer is terrible. I also don&#x27;t wear any makeup on the rest of my face, so I don&#x27;t know how well it works for foundation or blush or anything. I only have used it successfully with eye shadow (creams, pencils, and powders) and eye liner (pencil, kohl, and gel).  This setting spray definitely made me happy. And it smells nice, too!</li>
    <li> Not much better than just misting water on face. takes too long to dry and blotting it only smears make-up.</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t help keep my make-up on. And it is a dewy finish that last for short time before your make-up melts.</li>
    <li> Kinda small but my make up stays in place all day.. No bad smell and dries quickly..</li>
    <li> I like it so much! Works really well and a great price!</li>
    <li> hairspray does the same thing as this more expensive product. And alot of hairspray smells good.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it keeps my makeup in place and gives me a nice glow and finished look.</li>
    <li> Should have expected this from the cheap price, but the spray is completely nonfunctional. You have to press way too hard for the spray, and it comes out in a violent stream about 1 inch wide . Squirted right in my eye and I definitely did not need that in my day. Just pay the extra for a Mac one or something.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it as an all over setting spray after I apply my makeup, but I also use it for my eye shadow. I spray one side of my eye shadow brush with a quick mist, then I dab it in the eye shadow of my choice and apply it to my eyelid...... No need for primer. This setting spray allows the eye shadow to stay on my lids all daaaayyyy!! Better than plain water.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I was won over the first time I tried it. I did my makeup in the morning and spent most of the day outdoors, and was soooo tired come night that I fell asleep with my makeup on, the next morning I was shocked when I looked in the mirror! It was as if I had just applied my makeup! Will not go without it from now on!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this, it actually does set my make up!&lt;br /&gt;My face is very oily and this helps a little to keep my make form fading off during the day. Just a tip for those who say It leaves a dewy look, try applying compact powder over the spray, this will leave a matte look and help it last a loooot lot longer</li>
    <li> Love this setting spray, it&#x27;s nice and light and does the job. Your makeup feels complete after you add this on.</li>
    <li> Ingredients are mostly a bunch of chemicals and the size of the bottle is very small.</li>
    <li> Not sure what this product is suppose to do.. But it does nothing for my makeup.. I spray it on after I put on my makeup but I still have to blot my makeup throughout the day, so I&#x27;m really not sure what this product is suppose to do..</li>
    <li> The wife Previously used Merle Norman mist and it was satisfactory. But this product is much better. The spray pattern is wider and it seems to hold better and longer than what She had been using.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but am happy with this so far. It seems to hold my makeup in place until I take it off at the end of the day, but I also work in an office. This is what I currently use makeup-wise, so it might depend on what type of foundation/powders you wear on whether it will work for you. It&#x27;s cheap enough, so give it a try! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT Cosmetics CC Cream&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment&lt;br /&gt;IT Costmetics Bye Bye Pores Powder&lt;br /&gt;Milani Bronzer&lt;br /&gt;Milani Baked Blush&lt;br /&gt;Elf Baked Highlighter</li>
    <li> very good product, my daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOODNESS! WORKS LIKE A CHARM!! Honestly better than the Mac makeup setting spray and that is a big deal for such a cheap product. I really do love elf. They are incredible! And my bank account loves them as well ;)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product I bought this item at my local drug store and now I&#x27;m on my third bottle. I love E.L.F products I have never had a complaint about anything I ever bought from their line.</li>
    <li> I love it and it got it here quick!</li>
    <li> Great product itself. Container and spray pump not the best. Product spills out from the sides.</li>
    <li> Love it can&#x27;t do without it</li>
    <li> I tried using this, since i do sweat throughout the day (have to do some heavy lifting at work sometimes). My makeup still smears, and this nearly always makes a lash mark above my eye, even if i didnt get moist that day. Not very helpful for my heavy duty needs</li>
    <li> Terrible! It does absolutely nothing!</li>
    <li> Useless product. It does nothing.</li>
    <li> e.l.f is usually great quality for cheap prices, but this setting spray makes me face oilier and shiny and it makes me makeup look weird after I put it on, not as matte as it was before. This is just not working for me.</li>
    <li> My makeup feels flawless!Great product</li>
    <li> I am allergic to this product</li>
    <li> This is just as good as MAC, except the price. I love it and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It works very well for holding my makeup in place. I&#x27;m a model and use it after any makeup application, even if I don&#x27;t do the makeup myself. In hot lighting and with a lot of makeup it can run or smear super easily, and this stopped that!</li>
    <li> Makeup runs worse then before</li>
    <li> This product really helps keep my makeup in place. I have naturally oily skin and I usually end up with a lot of shine, and when I dab my face some of my makeup comes off. This really helps reduce the shine as well. When you first spray it, it feels a little wet, but dries very quickly. Once it is dry, I can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing it.</li>
    <li> Came tightly packed and works like a charm! Love it and worth the price!</li>
    <li> Sweet and simple. This product is exactly what I expected it to be. I hated getting make up on everything and with this product I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I never realized how important setting spray was until using this. I have a bad habit of touching my face alot and smearing my makeup. After using the set spray I have no icky residue off my fingers and my makeup still looks amazing!!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a setting spray and so far I really like this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling on my face or any kind of heavy feeling. It&#x27;s really refreshing and odorless. I received my spray faster than I expected</li>
    <li> I love this so much it&#x27;s so cool and refreshing. If you work a lot and have crazy hours or say up late &amp; dont rest well typically your face will feel tired. This will make your face feel cool and moisturizer but NOT oily! It&#x27;s one of my favorite ELF products and is extremely gentle and should be everyone&#x27;s first step in makeup application ... The spray mist is easy to use and dries quickly but if you&#x27;re in a rush simply touch it in ... But nothing beats that AHHH feeling first thing before make up application on a tired face. I have what I&#x27;d call combination skin it&#x27;s neither oily or terribly dry .. Perhaps if your skin is more dry you&#x27;d do better with a aloe gel but this is excellent for normal to combination skin. Try it and I think you&#x27;ll be a fan.</li>
    <li> It doesnt feel heavy at all after spraying my face feels refreshed!. And i love the way my make up looks. Definitely will ré purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Holds my makeup all day/night and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me oily. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have very oily skin and no matter what primers I have used nothing has worked for me and I payed 6.00 for this instead of 30.00 primer and it works wonders. Just follow the directions and it really does work wonders and takes out my shine. Love this especially for he price.</li>
    <li> It worked better then i expected. I will definitely will be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was fast also.</li>
    <li> I have never understood why other women can wear makeup without it becoming smeared. I do not have oily skin yet I end up with raccoon eyes every time I use eye makeup, even when using waterproof styles. I saw good ratings for this e.l.f. makeup setting spray so thought I would try, yet again, another product. Using it was easy. You simply spray it on your face after applying makeup. It took a few tries to get just the right amount of spray. The first time I held it too close to my face and it ended up with drops large enough to roll down my face. I learned to hold it farther away and just give a short spray. Looks like water and after it dries it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on your face. And, it actually kept my eye makeup from sliding down under my eyes. Eight hours later it&#x27;s still in place. After about 12 hours I was beginning to see some smearing but I could have re-applied and I think it would have held longer.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try. I now use it daily.</li>
    <li> ELF has been my go to label for many items that were priced out of my budget with other brands. I had never heard of it before but tried this spray out and it worked well. When I run out I will be buying this again</li>
    <li> Amazing how much better my makeup stays put with a couple pumps of this makeup mist.  Will use from now on.</li>
    <li> Great products for the price. You can get it for 3.00. Not sure why it&#x27;s priced at 6.00</li>
    <li> The spray is large droplets instead of a mist. Will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t spray in a fine mist too wet!</li>
    <li> Love it! Shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. I love using it!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using any makeup setters and I am so happy I finally got some. This definitely keeps the makeup on and around my nose in place. I&#x27;m usually red around there and find my makeup is wearing off around midday, but with this my nose is less greasy and I don&#x27;t need to touch up my makeup as much. A little powder around noon and I&#x27;m good to go into the night! Eye makeup stays put very well too - highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying, I have never used a setting spray before, so I have no other product line comparison. That being said, I am very happy with this setting spray. I seen it on Amazon, read the reviews and purchased it at Walmart for about $6. (I didn&#x27;t want to wait for shipping, it&#x27;s summer time! lol) Within the first week I was already sold. It has a pleasant but not lingering smell. It dries quickly. I am Italian and get very oily through the day, constantly needing to dab my face and apply powder. (and losing my makeup in the process) Now I dab and apply ONE additional time - through an ENTIRE day. It stays put even through my evening runs, until I wash it off. I have a flawless finish and know that even if I can&#x27;t see my face, it&#x27;s on point - thanks E.L.F.!!!! I&#x27;m beginning to slowly replace every other brand in my makeup sets haha.</li>
    <li> Very happy wit the way it leaves my make up.. I have Oily skin , u can&#x27;t even tell anymore n I don&#x27;t need to touch up at all .. Worth the price</li>
    <li> Its like am not using any setting spray. I don&#x27;t like this.it does not last at all.I will not buy it again</li>
    <li> Apsoluly love this setting spray. I will buy this again...Awesome !!! My makeup wares so much longer and looks z beautiful.</li>
    <li> Great for having make up on the whole day without fear of it being faded by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I use primer fairly regularly to provide a better cavas for makeup application.  I hadn&#x27;t used a makeup setting spray until recently.  When paired with a primer, a setting spray such as the only made by e.l.f. is a good investment.  After a fourteen hour day of preparing for, participating in, and then celebrating a wedding, the only thing I had to reapply was lipstick.  The makeup still looked good at the end of the day save for under my eyes, where it seemed a little creased.  All in all, I would buy this again.  I wasn&#x27;t rubbing my face with my hands or on clothing so I can&#x27;t say whether the makeup would rub off with great pressure.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much but it gives you a nice mist without messing up your name up lol. Oh and its actually on the elf website for $3 :(</li>
    <li> I got the wrong item which was similar in size but the outer label was trying. Still hoping to resolve.</li>
    <li> excellent product and great presentation</li>
    <li> This is my first time using setting spray, and this product received great reviews, especially for the price, I had to try the item. So far so good! My face is still shiny however, but I have oily skin, so all you have to do is remist and keep going!</li>
    <li> it wears off! and i leave make up stains on white materials, my hands, and clothes....wish it would do ots job alittle better.</li>
    <li> This product is great to spritz on your face once make up is applied and then later in the day to refresh your look. The price was excellent! I purchase 2 and wanted topurchase more, but the price went to 9.99 after my purchase. The price was not offered again by this particular vendor.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE BUT NOT THE BEST.</li>
    <li> My makeup always used to come off within hours, but with this spray my makeup stays on all day long!</li>
    <li> Honestly not sure if this actually work or if it&#x27;s all in my head, but I continue to use it and think it makes at least a small difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very new to makeup so I decided to go with this because of the price and good reviews. This stuff works really good. I use Clinique Beyond Perfecting 2 in 1, a beauty blender and alittle lotion added to my foundation (no primer). I spray this on once I finish everything. From what I&#x27;ve experienced it makes my foundation look like skin. It takes away that dry look some foundations gives you. It also feels so refreshing to have on my face. I love this product but because I&#x27;m new to makeup I want to try something new but I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to be coming back for this stuff. :D</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times and notice no difference in my make up, a little sticky.</li>
    <li> This definitely keeps my makeup in place. I like, however, to add slice of moon to my setting sprays to give it a glitter effect. While it has never clogged a pump in the past, it did clog this one. That does not stop me from using it however, as I just apply it with a makeup sponge. It sets my makeup for the day and my makeup stays in place until I wash it off at night. I have used more expensive brands in the past and this product works just as well as all of the more expensive brands I have used. I definitely recommend it. Even if you can afford the more expensive brand, there is no reason to pay more for a name when this product works just as well. I now stock up on this.</li>
    <li> This is gonna help for big events, when you wanna be in makeup all day and have it not wipe off.</li>
    <li> I usually buy the Mac misting spray but I ran out and this was a cheaper available option. I mean it does the job just as well and sets makeup the same as the spray fix plus.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. It kept my face looking fresh all day. I applied the product at 5:30am and reapplied it at 7pm. I only used three sprays, one on the left side of my face, one on the right side and one in the middle. I didn&#x27;t touch up my makeup and it still looked great. My makeup lasted more than 12 hours, from 5:30am to 12:30pm the next day! Usually I have a lot of makeup transfer on my clothes but this product reduced that. I definitely will be using this product and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Basically this is my all time favorite makeup product! it sprays a nice cool mist and it keeps your make up smear free all day! however, not that this bothers me it does not set lip makeup in my experience. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Instead of the light mist I was expecting, I was attacked like a bug being sprayed with RAID..I even got my husband as he was driving.&lt;br /&gt;I transferred to another bottle with no issues. Nevertheless it does help my makeup stay on.</li>
    <li> this took forever to get here. but it&#x27;s cool.</li>
    <li> Never before had I heard of a &#x27;mist&#x27; to set my makeup. Wish I&#x27;d known sooner. This is such a refreshing splash/mist. I like that it &#x27;finishes&#x27; my makeup. Similar to the &#x27;concept&#x27; of hair spray, only much more refreshing and soothing. I&#x27;ve re-applied it during the day when I feel &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; and it helps rejuvenate me. When you&#x27;ve worked hard to perfect your makeup, it&#x27;s nice to know there&#x27;s a product that &#x27;sets it&#x27;. &amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34;..., pun intended.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Unable to use product b/c the bottle was delivered with a cracked nozzle &amp; this item is unable to be returned nor exchanged. The primer I ordered with this works great with my MAC concealer &amp; powder.</li>
    <li> great product.  My wife loves it,</li>
    <li> I bought this product bc normally 30 mins after I get my makeup on, my face is looking all shiny.  But today, I put it on in the morning, went out and ran errands, worked outside in the garage in the heat and here it is a good few hours later and my makeup is still in place and im not shining like a Christmas ornament. I will recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> Sure it works if your staying still all day, but it does nothing to prevent your makeup from melting off when you sweat!</li>
    <li> Wonderful this is the most amazing setting Makeup Mist, please give it a tryout you want have any regrets!p</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I bought this yesterday and tried it after putting on my makeup. After awhile I was informed that I didn&#x27;t get the job I was hoping for and of course I was a wimp with tears. But the only makeup that disappeared was on my nose! Truly impressed. It feels a bit wet after spraying but drys quickly. Love it!</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Theres plenty in it, and will only take one squirt. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in how long my makeup worked though. Might purchase again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I have used this for awhile now and can&#x27;t really say that it is working. I mist it on after applying my makeup and I can&#x27;t see that the makeup is staying on any longer than usual. Which for me isn&#x27;t long. I am going to stay with it for now because I find with the ELF products it is a matter of finding the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; that makes them work. So this week I will try to mist then wait a minute for it to dry then mist again and see what happens. so far it doesn&#x27;t break out my skin or make the makeup dry out on my face, so that is a plus!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a channel I follow on YouTube - Angie at Hot&amp;Flashy.  It&#x27;s affordable so no reason not to give it a try.  It really does set my mineral makeup and makes me look fresher. I plan to re-purchase this product.</li>
    <li> i really liked this makeup mist and i would reccomend it to people who are looking for a not so expensive spray because this works just fine and will get the job done the same as a really high-end makeup mist so i think that i will probably buy this product again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like how oily it makes my face look. It didn&#x27;t even last longer than normal. And yes I followed the directions and still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This keeps my makeup on all day and takes away cakeyness&amp;#34; powdery look :) will always buy this</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have tried a mist and set and I have to say I love it.  Living in Florida, my makeup usually sweats off or becomes oily but this spray kept my makeup on all day.  I use a few sprays to set the makeup and the spray feels refreshing on my face but does not soak my makeup.  It is not sticky and feels smooth on my face.  I come home after work and my usual t-zone shines are barely there with this stuff. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! It really does work, surprising for the price! It gives my face a dewy finish and dries off pretty fast. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item! Totally worth it! It came on time as well. Best setting spray for it&#x27;s affordable price!</li>
    <li> Used to body paint in a night club.  Worked better than the super expensive Ben Nye fixer and doesn&#x27;t smell like those weird peppermints grandmothers always have (unlike Ben Nye.)  No smell, worked great for a very crowded Fourth of July party on a dock.  Paint stayed on all night.</li>
    <li> this finishing mist works well for the money you spend. has a little funny smell, but it goes away after a few minutes. have read that the bottle squirts instead of mists--had not problem with mine, but was ready with an empty travel bottle that mists just in case.</li>
    <li> it works wonderfully, only problem I had is it leaked some in the package it was in during shipping so the plastic cover was stuck to the bottle and it was definitely very sticky bottle, washed it off and it works great.</li>
    <li> Well,  I&#x27;ve tried it.  Loved it.  It really,  really does work.  I wear makeup daily (and sometimes quite heavily),  and despite the current hot and sticky weather here at the moment,  this actually does the job really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell.  No tackiness.  And best of all,  no need to blot my t-zone.  Perfection in a lovely little 2 ounce spray bottle.  It sets both facial makeup and if I&#x27;m haphazard with spraying in the right direction lo and behold it sets my eye makeup without being told to do so!</li>
    <li> Did not noticed a difference when using this product as opposed to not using the product.</li>
    <li> After this after i have applied my make-up i spray my face and it stays in place all day!!!</li>
    <li> I love the mist. The spray was not sticky or greasy. My make up stayed on all day. I recommend this product to all women.</li>
    <li> refreshing and it works!</li>
    <li> i like this makeup mist spray because it makes my makeup stay in place all day but the only thing i don&#x27;t like is it leaves a little crust in the middle of my forehead in between my eyebrows but its not bad though.</li>
    <li> Great came extremly fast. The bottle sprays extra hard so be aware of that. Its not misty. Overall good though.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, good buy</li>
    <li> I love this spray. I wear a full face of makeup. Foundation, bronzer, the works. After about 4 hours, my face is usually melting off (in the summer) or in need of touch up. I bought this two weeks ago and have used it everyday since, but today was the ultimate test. After 4 hours of wear, my makeup looked fresh and I was impressed. Then, I took a nap and went outside to play in the sprinkler with my kids. I just looked in the mirror, and my makeup still looks like I just put it on. Freaking amazing, especially when you consider the price! I will be adding this to my everyday makeup routine!</li>
    <li> Love the refreshing mist but did not notice a HUGE difference at the end of the day.  Still will use it though.</li>
    <li> Just as described with very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mist because of having to fill in my brows with brow powder, but I use it all over my face. I have sensitive skin (VERY) and this mist does not aggravate it at all. In addition, even in triple-digit Texas summer heat, my makeup stays on ALL DAY every time I use this setting mist. Without it, it kind of melts off. I highly recommend this - great, inexpensive insurance that your makeup will look as good at the end of the day as it did when it was first applied! I will continue using this product!</li>
    <li> For the price, this product is a gem. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker and it&#x27;s not going to keep your make up perfect all day, but it will help lengthen the time your makeup will stay looking good.  Personally, it gave me a nice dewey look, which I love in the summer, makes me look younger, but that might not be for everyone.</li>
    <li> This is first time trying a setting spray and I bought it with the elf mineral infused primer. I don&#x27;t k ow if it&#x27;s the primer or this setting spray but using them together keeps my make up on and looking fresh for 8 hours of work even when I&#x27;m outside sweating . I like it</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x27;s the perfect size to take on the go/when traveling.</li>
    <li> Works great! My make up looks better and the delivery was on point but my only problem is the price. With shipping and handling I brought it for $12 whereas in target I found it for $3. I could buy four in target for the price of one on here.</li>
    <li> This works perferctly. My makeup stays on all day and I do not have to touch up with powder at all. Worth every penny that I bought it for. I love it. Plan to repurchase it again.</li>
    <li> Great product which I bought more, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t know if I like the product or not because I can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle!</li>
    <li> i rarely write reviews on Amazon purchases but I just got this yesterday and tried it today. I had some ugly zits I hid with cover stick and on this warm day had hoped it wouldn&#x27;t melt away and reveal them. It was 80 degrees out AND I gardened getting very sweaty. My make up ALL OF IT stayed put. Even my lipstick eyeshadow blush foundation and mascara. I will definitely buy this again and again. It saves so much time not having to reapply makeup all day long.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this stuff, but it works! It sets makeup and keeps it from getting slick and rubbing off too much. I can&#x27;t believe it. Try it!</li>
    <li> only giving it 2 because when I received this it was leaking all over</li>
    <li> Works wonders, no foundation transfer on my clothing or anyone else (when I give hugs) smile.</li>
    <li> This spray is supposed to &amp;#34;MIST&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s more like a spurting.  So maybe it&#x27;s the nozzle.  It does dry quickly and it does set my makeup for an all day finish.  I love that part!  I don&#x27;t have to reapply anything all day.  I&#x27;ll repurchase it again and see if the nozzle works differently and actually &amp;#34;Mists&amp;#34; my face.</li>
    <li> Before this item was even going to come to me I decided last minute to send it back &amp; got another spray at a local beauty supply store . I&#x27;m sure it works for some people , will buy some other time.</li>
    <li> works very well, my make up stayed in place for at least an hour and half, hate the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is gentle and it works love it</li>
    <li> Quite simply, it. is. amazing! ... And now it&#x27;s the only set that I use.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference when I use this.</li>
    <li> Keep the make up set for hrs</li>
    <li> This product works it seals make up all day. The only problem Is the initial smell when sprayed but it goes away</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these and although I love the product and it work great both bottles were leaking. Not very pleased.</li>
    <li> It works but so hot out here in Albuq. NM sweat this product right for this humidity but I&#x27;m sure it well work well when its a little cooler</li>
    <li> it was ok still only used 4 times</li>
    <li> Actually have bought this from a more expensive brand (mac) and don&#x27;t think it works as good as this ine and for an affordable price. I definitely will consider re-ordering it once I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I like the case and would give it 5 stars except the flaps for the charging port and silence switch are very tough to open. I have to use something metal to get them open. They are also very stiff and have to force them open enough to plug in charger, headphones, or switch to silent so I&#x27;m afraid I will break them off. If you don&#x27;t mind that, you will love this case. It seems to seal well, thinner than an Otter Box, and has 3 color backs and you can just leave it off for a black back.</li>
    <li> It makes my already oily face much oilier.  I use it if I must but I probably need a powder.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even bought this from amazon... I was just web surfing for beauty products and saw this was for $10.99... Ladies, you can go to your local Target and purchase this item for $3!!!!! $10.99 on amazon?! GTFO!!! It is an awesome product, I&#x27;ve been using this ever since it came out. But seriously, go to Target and buy it there for only $3 bucks no shipping. If you don&#x27;t know if your target carries E.L.F. Products, just go on their website and go to store locator and they&#x27;ll locate it for you.. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time when you can get it right away for cheap.</li>
    <li> I really like this product as it. Makeup stays fresh and face looks bright and smooth. Another good E.l.f. product.</li>
    <li> Product it self very good but I won&#x27;t buy it anymore in this website because I found it for $3 In e.l.f</li>
    <li> Great for makeup setting!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, and I don&#x27;t know that this is what helps my makeup stay but I&#x27;ll keep using anyway ;) I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but I like using this for the sake of at least feeling like sweating/going through the day isn&#x27;t going to make my coverage look gloppy. It may be the makeup I use, but I don&#x27;t notice that I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and there&#x27;s no sticky feeling. Just be aware that you&#x27;ll probably need to use a makeup sponge to even it out when sprayed, because It looks like little dots on your face.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Great product, better price!</li>
    <li> One of my favorites...love this spray...</li>
    <li> It really works! My makeup stays in place without my face feeling stiff or sticky. The only downside for me is the mist doesn&#x27;t spray evenly. But I can work around that.</li>
    <li> Very good.  Not oily like my MAC Fix+ spray and it actually sets my makeup and keep it from transferring unlike the MAC spray.  I love it.  Keeps my makeup in place for the entire day.  I know some people complain about the spray top not being fine enough but I didn&#x27;t have that problem.  I shake the bottle well and keep it as far away from my face as the bottle says.</li>
    <li> Kept my makeup looking fresh and totally made my eye shadow look fantastic !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, gives that dewy finish and it keeps the foundation from wearing off.  Foundation wear off was my biggest issue, so i&#x27;m very happy that this product solves this problem.  My blush and contouring powder seemed to wear off though, so a little bummed about that.  The smell is a little odd but its similar to my makeup removing wipe, so that OK.  All in all, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. The only complaint I have is that it is very wet and &amp;#34;drippy&amp;#34; when first sprayed on. I always have to dab it with a towel, but it dries fast. Makeup stays fresh all day with this product. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is also another one of my favorites from e.l.f. ... I love this stuff. Anything I spray it over, it turns it almost waterproof. My eyeliner is a JERK to get off after putting this stuff on, and that&#x27;s great. Eyeliner and mascara are some of my biggest enemies with makeup, and this just makes it so /easy./&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said: This is a $3 of makeup that is being sold for double that online. Buy it at Walmart or Target.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders my makeup lasts all day</li>
    <li> I work in fast food so its hot and my makeup tends to run but when I put this on it stays I love it. My makeup stays on so much longer I&#x27;m addicted. Its a must have for me.</li>
    <li> I took a foundation class at sephora and wanted to get a setting spray like I had used there. I put on my makeup like usual without the spray for a few days while waiting for this to arrive and my makeup was fine during that time. Then I started using the spray and noticed that after an hour or so my makeup would start to conjeal and even drip down my face a bit. I thought maybe I sprayed it on wrong so after a few different attempts I stopped using it and my makeup went back to staying fresh looking for many hours again. This might be find for light makeup but when using a full face of foundation, concealer, etc it just ruined it all. Very bummed.</li>
    <li> My skin is so oily and I use soap to help keep the oils to a minimum through the day before I used this stuff my makeup would get so sweaty looking ugh I hated it but then I used this stuff I fall asleep with my make up and all day through school my make up stays on and looks perfect it makes me so happy I recommend this highly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a week straight so far, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any weird breakouts or anything, so that&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It pretty much does what it says. It makes my makeup last all day, and when I&#x27;m out in the heat I&#x27;ll just spritz some on mid-day for a pick-me-up, it feels awesome and smells just fine. Good product for an even better price! :)&lt;br /&gt;(Although it may be a better bargain to order from the E.L.F. actual website, only if you had free shipping.)</li>
    <li> This setting spray is awesome! It keeps your makeup in place, and it has some good ingredients. It can be a heavy sprayer, so hold it about 6 inches away from your face.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay i used a mineral makeup and seems like it made it come off. I&#x27;m gonna try with a cream foundation and see how that works</li>
    <li> Made my makeup run all over the place.  Don&#x27;t get this.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work that great</li>
    <li> Not a bad product! I especially love it right after I apply both foundation &amp; setting powder - it doesn&#x27;t my skin look as matte. It definitely isn&#x27;t mattifying. But, it doesn&#x27;t make me oily either. Good product for a great price. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle now.</li>
    <li> Well...I have a so-so opinion of this. I opened it when I first recieved it, originally to see if it smelled bad, and discovered it had nearly no smell at all. I became suspicious and decided to dab alittle on my finger and tasted it. It tastes nearly like nothing. Water with a hint of something. I work in a very hot environment and have used this for two days now. I sprayed it on in the morning and again at lunch time. My makeup seems to smudge less, but I have also changed my cleansing and moisturising routine for the morning too. I have a feeling that this stuff did no good. I thought maybe the seller tampered with it, but it was in a box and plastic wrapped all around the bottle. I have a feeling that I got what I paid for with this, which was not much. The spray was really wet, I had to put it at arms length to keep from being drenched, but that seems common with setting sprays as I have seen reviews on other more expensive ones. All in all it was worth a try. I&#x27;ll probably keep tinkering with it to see if I actually works.</li>
    <li> Love this... Refreshing, doesnt break the bank and keeps my makeup looking fresh, and stay sput.</li>
    <li> The spray is not nearly fine enough. One spritz from a distance and it still makes my makeup run like I just walked through a thunderstorm.</li>
    <li> This is a great budget setting spray. It works!</li>
    <li> Thank you,I&#x27;m her satisfied...</li>
    <li> Keeps my makeup in place! 💖</li>
    <li> The bottle was broken when I received it and I can&#x27;t return it...</li>
    <li> When I applied the mist it gave my face a matte feeling and my makeup stayed on longer than it usually would without needing to touch it up.</li>
    <li> Before ordering this I would just spray a little hairspray on my face. I think I&#x27;ll stick to hairspray.</li>
    <li> This literally is a perfect product. Do your make up spray it and do not worry after that&lt;br /&gt;Tom Duda&#x60;s wife</li>
    <li> Seems to do what it is supposed to do. Very affordable! I would definetly purchase this again!</li>
    <li> This is lovely! It works so well</li>
    <li> feels really good when putting it on and I don&#x27;t have the problem with dry skin makeup flaking</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s very hydrating, the mist and set spray doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job holding my makeup in place. When I tough my face, my foundation comes off onto my fingers.</li>
    <li> This does what I want it to do- makes my makeup stay on face, even through harsh weather! I am almost incomplete with out it. My makeup even stays on after I nap. Great product.</li>
    <li> I thought this mist wouldn&#x27;t work as well as the more expensive products on the market but I was surprised it actually did.</li>
    <li> Horrible , my make up is matte, this product  dry forever make your skin look like a polished Easter egg .. sticky all day long , it does not hold my make up  longer, it actually was horrible after 3 hours..where my make up hold for over 8 hours.. I wish I did not purchased it and go for the model in the bottle...what is so much better..but i was to greedy ...also the package was wet and sticky as some of the liquid escapes while transit as other mentioned... don&#x27;t want it even for free</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really keeps your make up on all day...but it definitely feels rejuvenating when sprayed on after you finish putting on your make up. It feels great on your face. And it did not make me break out one bit- something I usually have trouble with.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this !!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wear it all the time and it leaves me a nice glowing face and makes my makeup last longer !! Will defiantly buy this again but at target !</li>
    <li> So far it appears to work well, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice mist, nice smell. Quick shipment.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a great price! I strongly reccomend this to anyone!  Buy this amazing product! If you need your makeup to last ALL day long, buy it!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Keep my makeup steady and it gives it a fabulous finish. Just remember to spray it 12 inches from your face for better results</li>
    <li> I recieved it earlier than expected, it came in great condition. I like this product because it helps my makeup stay in place, and doesn&#x27;t really rub off on my husband&#x27;s shirts if I put my head on his shoulders or something like it did before the setting mist!</li>
    <li> This will be perfect for my daughters dance competition</li>
    <li> I bought this from ELF and I rather liked it. To be honest I&#x27;m not super positive if it worked to any expectation, because I did not have any and I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up (really just foundation and a lip gloss), but I liked the effect that it had while I was wearing it. My face definitely wasn&#x27;t shiny, and it is exremely easy to use. I did not get any disgusting smell like some seemed to have gotten, but I think after a while a smell does resonate. I guess it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t use it often, but that can be besides the point.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff, absolutely keeps make up on through the day!</li>
    <li> This setting spray seems good for me. I have been out under very hot weather and my make up has stayed on. My only issue is the bottle itself. It doesn&#x27;t spray evenly the first time but after you spray it once it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I like this spary holds my make up</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best mist and set I have tried yet. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> I have to say this stuff is really great. I have extremely oily skin that ruins my makeup a lot but this spray keeps it from getting oily and ruining my makeup. Plus my face feels fresh all day even if I have been outside all day!</li>
    <li> My make up stay in place for hours no retouch need it.</li>
    <li> Sprayer needs to be fine a mist, but all in all, makeup stays.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Works alright but doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
    <li> The price was reasonable.  I sprayed it on my face but it was strong not a light mist. I had to pat some off and hope it didn&#x27;t ruin my make up.  But next time I held it further away, it worked better and does hold my makeup longer.  Though I still wish the spray was more like a mist...then you wouldn&#x27;t use as much.</li>
    <li> I heard alot about the Elf makeup setting spray for your face and i decided to try it oppose to spending almost $30.00 for the Urban Decay spray. It&#x27;s ok, it does help a little with keeping my makeup on through out the day but it seems to make my under eye area look dry. Thats just my experience, it might work better for other people, it depends since everyones body chemistry reacts differently to certain products. It wasn&#x27;t that great on me but it might work great on others. I think i will stick with the Urban Decay, yes it&#x27;s more expensive but its works great!</li>
    <li> This is $3 at Target. Please do not spend more than that lol! With that being said this product is inexpensive and works great! My makeup lasts for hours and does not rub off as easily, such as when I hug someone, etc. I add eyeliner and mascara after I spray b/c if I spray too close to my face it may cause runoff.</li>
    <li> Awesome... WAS ACTUALLY  MADE SUCH A DIFF. IN M MAKE UP... Im A PROFESSIONAL MAKE UP ARTIST... I USE ON CLIENTS AND RECOMMEND this product to ea. one...skin looks so smooth...Looks freash and fills in wrinkles by magic. WE HAVENT FIGURED OUT HOW YET... IM A FOREVER CLIENT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure about this.  I think it&#x27;s causing irritation to my eyes...and, NO.  I&#x27;m not spraying it into them!  There must be some chemical in there that&#x27;s irritating.  I&#x27;m not convinced about it&#x27;s ability to keep the makeup from breaking day before the end of the day, either.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products!</li>
    <li> Elf is my favorite brand,</li>
    <li> At  Frist I was  apprehensive buying this product but after reading all the other great reviews I decided to give it a try I wanted my makeup to stay in place as I am a busy mom on the go and I don&#x27;t have much time for touch ups.  this product Kept my makeup in place perfectl!  not once did I have to touch up my makeup. I was shocked. it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your face either I highly recommend implementing this into your beauty routine! Great  product I am very satisfied. I  have even mistakenly falling asleep in my makeup I woke up looking  as though I had just Put on my makeup.  love this product I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> holds my make up amazing. smells good and easy to use. comes in no time. small bottle but it actually holds a lot of the product in.</li>
    <li> It may work for you, but I honestly can&#x27;t tell any difference with my makeup, as far as it last any longer without it. Nevertheless, its okay. Warning!!!: DO NOT HOLD CLOSE TO YOUR FACE or your face WILL BE soaked!!! Enjoy.</li>
    <li> moistens and feels refreshing when applied. just wish I dont have to keep re-applying</li>
    <li> This is great stuff really helps keep your makeup in place!</li>
    <li> The bottle was leaking when I opened the package. I cleaned it off and thought it might be okay, but it still leaked from the cap when I went to use it. I plan on pouring the content into a different spray bottle to use the product. It sprayed on a little unevenly - there was mist and also bigger droplets that took longer to dry on my face. Not sure if I just had a broken bottle. Once it dried it felt very comfortable, though. I am new to using setting spray, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to other sprays, but it seems to do it&#x27;s job okay (compared to nothing).</li>
    <li> This product is afforable for beginners on a budget; it contain ingredients with aloe, green tea, cucumber, and vitamins A,C, and E. It&#x27;s great for all day wear and adding a radiance shine.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s a great price and it works great! It keeps my makeup in place all day.</li>
    <li> So when I first ordered this I expected a cheaper product due to price. Fortunately the product quality has exceeded expectations. I was happy to find out all the different vitamins they&#x27;ve put into this product. So it&#x27;s sensitive skin friendly! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month, and not one zit. It does help makeup stay into place, before I used it my eyeliner and eyeshadow would be gone/smeared within an hour or two. With it, my makeup stays on for about five or six hours before beginning to smear. Overall I like the product, love the price of it.. BUT, it does have a God awful smell when first applied.. It&#x27;s like a stinky foot mixed with cucumbers. The smell fades almost instantly (at least I assume, I could just become &amp;#34;nose blind&amp;#34; after a while)  lol</li>
    <li> great product, satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I have had no issues with this product, My local Walmart started selling e.l.f. products recently and everything is $6 bucks or less! Snagged this for just $3. It smells very nice, and definitely helps keep make-up in place.</li>
    <li> The lid wasn&#x27;t screwed on correctly. When the package arrived i opened it and about 1/8 of contents had leaked. It was all wet. But the product works.</li>
    <li> Seriously an unbelievable product. It gives my skin THE healthiest glow AND it appears to be clearing up my acne. I&#x27;ll use this every day for the rest of my life, God-willing.</li>
    <li> Not the best by any means, but it is refreshing to spray on your face throughout the day. It didn&#x27;t make my makeup last longer. I prefer the nyx matte setting spray and Mac Fix+. I like all the natural minerals and such that is added to this spray though!</li>
    <li> makes my make up last long and I love it</li>
    <li> Adds a few hours of beauty to your makeup. Very nice for the price.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I&#x27;ve used a couple of times and keeps my bronzer looking fresh,</li>
    <li> I bought this based off all of the reviews and how awesome it is... well guess what? It&#x27;s not... the spray is not a mist but yet a high powered stream that if not taken into account will have you looking like you just got done watching a sappy movie. I tried soaking the sprayer in alcohol and still it was like getting sprayed in the face with a water gun. I would not recommend this product to anyone... guess I will have to go back to my over priced product...</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the money. Sets my expensive makeup beautifully.</li>
    <li> has been the best spray for me out of urban decay and model in a bottle, light mist and a decent scent. cheap price!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, for the price. win win.</li>
    <li> This is the first make-up setter that I have tried.  I read a few online beauty reviews saying that this worked well and was cheap.  You could probably get it for less in the store but there is nothing like the convenience of shopping from home :-)  Keeps my make-up from wearing off throughout the day.</li>
    <li> this is a great product, would rate it the same as mac fix + spray. Just because a item is expensive dont mean that it is better than the cheap item. i will save 15 dollars and purchase this from now on. I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This product is FULL of parabens and the &amp;#34;green tea&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Aloe&amp;#34; are so far down the ingredients list they&#x27;re basically irrelevant.  The bottle also leaked while on it&#x27;s way through the mail and it leaves a very sticky, slimy residue - it makes me not even want to try using it on my face.</li>
    <li> easy to use, great durability</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, but the spray is pretty harsh, not really a &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; so much as a &amp;#34;blast.&amp;#34;  So not great for just refreshing makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this one time.  I&#x27;m finishing the Mary Kay I&#x27;m using now, then will pour the elf into the Mary Kay bottle.  The sprayer on the elf is a little too heavy I think.  The Mary Kay sprayer emits a much finer mist.</li>
    <li> It really works and it doesn&#x27;t make my face itch or break out.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for the price</li>
    <li> Great setter!  Long lasting, and feels nice on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this in store so it was dollars cheaper. I love this stuff. My face is usually really oily after a couple of hours of wear but with this stuff it doesn&#x27;t get oily and keeps my makeup in place.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this from Target for 3 bucks and it works really great! It also keeps my eyebrows from disappearing (lol) after a long day. This is a great setting powder.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this makeup mist and set.  I  started using this about two months ago and I am hooked.  I used to apply my makeup and ten minutes later, my face, especially my nose, would be so shiny. I was frustrated until I saw this at Old  Navy and  decided to buy it.  Ever since, I am  hooked!&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after applying my makeup, I spray this all over my face and neck. IT DOES not have a smell. It is like water with no fragrance at all.  My makeup look airbrushed-- just flawless after I apply this.  It does not wear off even after 8 hours of no touch up or reapplication. I am hooked and you will be too.</li>
    <li> Works very nicely... no smell at all. I use two sprays, one for the left side and one for the right. Make sure you are spraying 12 inches away! Product is smaller than it looks but it is plenty for a makeup mist/set and for the great price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Went to a wedding for 6 hours and my make up stayed as if i just got it done!perfect for me! Will be buying again! Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this product! Sets my makeup well!</li>
    <li> Love this. Will definitely order again. This is the first time I ever used a set and spray mist and it really does work!</li>
    <li> I tried mine 4 times and every single time my face was itchy (Not the kind that you just want to scratch your face off..just the light uncomfortable itchiness). I probably should&#x27;ve stopped the first (or 2nd or 3rd lol) but it actually worked that I wanted to give it a chance!!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be buying this again. Maybe I&#x27;ll try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I use this along with e.l.f. High Definition Powder to set my makeup. I love the results. I spent 6 hours outside, walking around a zoo in 90° heat. I felt sweaty and gross, surely my make up was long gone. I got in the car, looked in the mirror and my makeup looked just as good as it did that morning right after I&#x27;d applied it. I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this for a while.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ever to use a product like this. I admit I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work especially in the high humidity of Arkansas. I was surprised and amazed that it did. It takes about 2 to 3 minutes to dry and set  but once it does it does wonders. This has been my go to product . Love how it keeps my make up on thru the humidity.</li>
    <li> Liked the finishing product and long lasting throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Received fast package leaked a bit! Works well!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this stuff- when I ran out of it, I freaked out, not wanting to miss a day without it and ordered it through Prime with 1 Day Shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have much experience with makeup setting sprays, but this is by far a GREAT product. I wear concealer, eyeliner &amp; a little bit of powder. I HATE the caked on look so this not only keeps my makeup in place but leaves my face with a dewey, lovely look that I use to blend in my setting powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff so much, it lasts me forever &amp; it&#x27;s really cheap compared to other setting sprays I&#x27;ve seen. During the summer I&#x27;d probably mist it on to freshen up my melting face. I will definitely be repurchasing after I use up this bottle as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with the spray. It is kind of a weird smell but fades fast.</li>
    <li> This is available at Kmart for $3.00. You do the math. Also it really has no \\&quot;setting\\&quot; properties. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job! Shipped super fast as well so I am happy!</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and have been using this along with a primer and I really haven&#x27;t seen a difference in the wear or transference of my make-up. Proactive is my face care and I wonder if I need to discontinue the oil-free moisturizer when I use this. I will continue use the product and see if my skin just needs to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I love ELF!!! This product works great. I have purchased many ELF products and and I believe they work as well as the high end products. I also recommend the gel eyeliner!!!</li>
    <li> I love the elf products. Great product but Amazon has it for too much I paid three dollars directly from elf.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, it works for the first 8 hours but after that my eyeliner starts to smear and I get a little raccoon eyes but it works long enough for me to go to work and still look presentable. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well.  remember to hold it a distance from your face, though.  lol</li>
    <li> Makes makeup look like I just put it on. Doesn&#x27;t get to the washed out look after a full day.</li>
    <li> Have to spray lightly or you will have to apply foundation all over again</li>
    <li> It definitely sets your makeup and keep oil to a minimum, but don&#x27;t put too much on.</li>
    <li> This is worthy of a good review. No strong scent. Did not irritate my sensitive skin. Seems to set my make-up and keep it in place as promised, and I like to think the vitamins and aloe soothe my tired skin. It stands up to some of my other more expensive cosmetics. Would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Works well for what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after my Urban Decay makeup setter ran out. Not wanting to spend $30 on another bottle of that, I opted to give this a try. For the price, it does a good enough job, although I would say it&#x27;s about 75% as effective as the Urban Decay. My biggest problem with it is the sprayer, which does not mist the product evenly on my face (at least relative to the Urban Decay). All in all, I would purchase this again in a pinch, but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
    <li> This product is alright I guess it holds my makeup together but it doesn&#x27;t keep it on all day or give it much of a chewy finish.But it feels nice</li>
    <li> Really keeps your makeup set.......this is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! It exceeded my expectations considering the brand. It gives my makeup a natural look. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Good purchase, nice product.</li>
    <li> Works well. It sets my makeup very good.</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time and a really good product</li>
    <li> Sets makeup perfectly!!</li>
    <li> Works great and long Lasting....i purchased mine at Walmart for 3$</li>
    <li> This actually does work!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright not the best but works.</li>
    <li> The great thing about this product it does not  feel sticky and has no smell at all.It works extending time my makeup lasts,I think.&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have with this product is mister.This mister is absolutely horrendous it sprays unevenly,some patches of my face are dripping wet other areas feel completely dry and on top of everything it leaks all over the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So the product is OK but I will not buy it any more because of packaging.I should probably try and find different bottle for it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect for dry skin,especially those who tend to get dry after makeup application!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel it made any difference. And the spray came out pretty heavy, not like a light mist. I like the nyx matte spray better.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product at all. It&#x27;s supposed to be a mist that goes straight to your face so you&#x27;ll think at least the smell will be nice and modest, but this smells like you left a bottle of water in the sun for 1 year.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff and it really works well for the price.  You don&#x27;t feel sticky after spraying this, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unsettling smell.  I also like how much use I will get out of this product.  It only takes me about 2-3 sprays per use, and I can&#x27;t even tell a dent in the liquid after using this product a couple of times. Everyone wants their makeup to stay all day, and this product helps you achieve that.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just as good as higher-priced alternatives for sale now.</li>
    <li> I work in retail and my make up by the end of the night is gone. I got home and looked in the mirror and every single make up that I put on that day was still there. after spraying on e.l.f. make up mist and set from my eyeliner to my blush was still there yea.</li>
    <li> I normally use Evian, so I think I&#x27;m a bit spoiled when it comes to setting sprays. However- this is great spray that does everything it says it going to. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s not useful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and this is awesomer than you. I thought this stuff looked good cause I like elfs and it says elf on it. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have a real elf  :(  But it turns out this stuff tastes great; I drink about 1 bottle each week. Also it makes me smell like flowers. I likey!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure if it does lengthen my makeup wear or not, but it does give my face a beautiful polished look after applying and letting it dry. Makes makeup look more natural and fresh. Not greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is rather funky but dissipates after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you spray this FAR from your face - at least 12 inches away or it goes on too wet and uneven. I use a small desk fan afterwards in front of my face to help it dry quickly so that it doesn&#x27;t have a chance to \\&quot;run.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had so many mishaps with applying/selecting brands/selecting the correct color for my foundation that I knew I was missing a simple ingredient and this was it! Not so much the e.l.f mist setting spray per say, just the finish that the setting sprays provide on the skin. I guess it depends on a ladies personal preference and mine is a more natural finish since the make up that I use tends to be heavy and takes on a very unnatural look but I can honestly say that this product is for the price the magic wand that I&#x27;d been missin. My Husband even noticed the more hydrated looking affect that is had on my skin! Now that&#x27;s sayin somethin ....I tell u what!!!!! Until I decide to try a more expensive brand  to tickle my fancy this particular brand will do me just fine! The smell that these other ladies are speaking of is really not that serious...I won&#x27;t even entertain touching the subject. BUY THE PRODUCT! TRY THE PRODUCT Good Luck :) oh and I have very dry skin if that helps!</li>
    <li> i really like this product. i used it this during the weekend and went to new jersey and it was hot there but the makeup stayed. but it make my t-zone shiny. im not sure if it was not supposed to. and the spray, i dont know what wrong with it, when i squeeze it, too much product comes put and i have to wait like five mins for my face to dry or stand if front of a fan</li>
    <li> I usually use the urban decay brand makeup setting spray but this is just as good and way more economical!</li>
    <li> Works great for me.  Softens the appearance of the foundation and gives it a dewy look.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see too much difference.</li>
    <li> was on the fence about this product but it makes my makeup last all day!! (makeup used to stay on for maybe an hour before smearing bc i buy cheap) totally worth it. it doesnt smear at all</li>
    <li> This stuff seems rather useless to me cuz i didn&#x27;t really see a difference at all and it felt kind of sticky going on</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok. It helps a little</li>
    <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or break me out. It&#x27;s affordable and it&#x27;s okay for its price. It does set my makeup and prolongs it for a little much longer, but it doesn&#x27;t really help with oil control. I use this whenever I have makeup on, minimal or not. I use this more of a &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; spray than a setting spray. If you just want an everyday mist to refresh your face, then I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> Came in on the day it said it would. Perfectly packaged. Definitely will buy again. Thank you❤️.</li>
    <li> Love this it&#x27;s refreshing and cool on the face and sets the makeup so your face doesn&#x27;t get to dry .</li>
    <li> This product works great, just wish there was a different atomizer. I also thought I would be purchasing another bottle quickly because of its size, but little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Just received this yesterday I love the ingredients love the smell and love that it stays put.</li>
    <li> I noticed no difference when spraying this product on my face after putting my makeup on. It was just like spraying my face with water. It also wasn&#x27;t a very fine mist and left large spray dots on my face that took ages to dry. Still on the hunt for a good setting spray!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts but it really does work, at least it does for me, ymmv.  I spray it after I&#x27;m finished with my makeup, I&#x27;ve tried it both ways, with mascara already on and without, it doesn&#x27;t seem to effect my mascara at all.  I always have a shiny forehead and my nose.  Not with this stuff, I&#x27;m pretty much shine free for well over 10 hours.  The only thing I have notices is that I need to spray my entire face, let it dry, and then specifically spray it again closer to my nose, I do get a tiny bit of shine on my nose, I may have to blot once during the day but today I spray extra on my nose and it seems to be holding up well.  On a side note, it&#x27;s only $3.00 elsewhere in the ELF aisle, much easier to walk in and picke it up instead of orderin, I will be stocking up on this stuff and hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> Like the formula, but the bottle sprayer sucks. I put this inside an old MAC FIX + container and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Trust me on this, it helps a lot. Amazon does make you pay more for this which i very rare. Go to your local drugstore like target or Walmart and you can get it for 3 dollars.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and packaging was good.&lt;br /&gt;keeps my makeup in place all day without any touch up.  Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> for the money , this is a good mist</li>
    <li> I love using this spray in the summer months. It does a great job setting the makeup when I use water based powder foundations and I use it in lieu of primer. It does not work well with water based liquid foundation. It makes the foundation look as if I&#x27;ve been wearing it for days and it&#x27;s melting off,  not to mention making my face look oily. Which is not a good look. So it&#x27;s a good, affordable product if you&#x27;re using powder foundation.</li>
    <li> Excellent! It really makes my make up stay in place longer !</li>
    <li> it sets the makeup very well ,make me less oily when i wear makeup</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I tested it out by putting on a full face of makeup and then running errands on foot in 80F humid weather. I still had to scrub a bunch to get the makeup to come off at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend squirting the mist into the air and then walking in to it... the spray comes out fast and will wet just part of your face if you spray it on directly.</li>
    <li> I have always had oily skin, and have used many products like this in the past. I saw this at a great price (and it has great reviews!) and though I would give it a go. I like that it comes out in a soft spray, not hard like some setting sprays. I did have to wipe it around my face with a cosmetics sponge though, so I&#x27;m sure that resulted in me using more than I needed. This is a good product, and it&#x27;s simple to use. Easy to follow directions  make it fool proof. It&#x27;s just a spray after all! So get some of this, and get rid of that oil slick!!</li>
    <li> Love this product, will be buying it again!!</li>
    <li> Sets BB cream and powder perfectly. Even made my lipstick last longer.</li>
    <li> I expected better results.I not feel my makeup last much.</li>
    <li> Woorks really well...makeup stays on rather nicely.  Just wish it was more of a spritz instead of a spray....keep your eyes closed when usinf this item</li>
    <li> Love this!  Sets my face for the day!  Won&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
    <li> Packaging was BADLY damaged when I received this in the mail, but the product itself was fine so no complaints there I&#x27;d just like to warn anyone who may be considering getting this as a gift or something. I got this to help keep my makeup in place because I&#x27;m sick of my face melting off in the heat. I got it about a week ago and have used it every day and it works really well at keeping your makeup on. It&#x27;s been 108 degrees almost every day this week and even then my makeup has not budged!! Usually my face gets very sweaty and shiny but since I&#x27;ve started using this my face has stayed matte almost all day. In addition, I&#x27;d noticed my makeup wasn&#x27;t blended well and tried to rub it to blend it but I ended up having to take it off and start over in that area because this stuff works so well. I even took a nap and found myself only having to fix my eyeliner. I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for this product but it&#x27;s a pretty good buy. It works. Just make sure you hold it pretty far away from your face or else it&#x27;ll be too wet. I also don&#x27;t know what smell everyone is talking about. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, I don&#x27;t even notice it really has a smell.</li>
    <li> This has been a great purchase for summer.  This has helped my makeup stay in place through the heat and humidity of summer!  I still get a little shiny throughout the day, but this product has minimized that issue.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far. Didn&#x27;t notice a change. So I will keep trying it out. It was leaking though when I received it.</li>
    <li> I use this mist and set all the time. I have extremely oily skin and it is SUPERB. I never have to touch up. The formula is light and dries pretty fast. Obviously you use this after you have applied your makeup NOT before. You can find this in Walmart for $3.00 and in Target for a little over $3. If you reside in an area where you do not have these stores I advise you to purchase on Amazon as an ad on.</li>
    <li> This product works for me, kept my makeup looking good all day.</li>
    <li> I typically like ELF products though I haven&#x27;t tried this one.  A lot of the ELF products on Amazon tend to be a little over priced. This is only $3 on the ELF website.  Also, they&#x27;re having some sort of back to school sale until the 18th. This and at least 50 other products are %50 off with the code SCHOOL50. I&#x27;ll be stocking up on a few of my essentials I suggest you do too.</li>
    <li> I am trying this product for the first time as to set my daily makeup routine.  So far it looks like it is helping with keeping my makeup on after doing massages in the evening, I noticed I don&#x27;t have to reapply anything except my lipstick. If it continues to work as I think it would; I will order again</li>
    <li> Feels same as other mister</li>
    <li> I use this everyday! My makeyup no longer wipes off when I blow my nose!!</li>
    <li> I usually use Model in a Bottle but was looking for something with a better rating on the EWG Skin Deep database and that was a little bit cheaper. This product definitely fits the bill! It&#x27;s not quite as effective as Model in a Bottle, but it&#x27;s very close. It&#x27;s less sticky and more lightweight and also doesn&#x27;t have a funky smell to it. The price is awesome too!</li>
    <li> I first discovered e.l.f. at Target. The Make Up mist sets your make up flawlessly. It is also great for hot days when you need refreshing. Bargain price &amp; worth every dime!</li>
    <li> Satisfied with merchandise</li>
    <li> This stuff is cool. Although I was worried about just spraying it right on my face, I kinda misted it above me and dipped my face into it. My make up was still in place and looked great after working all day. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Got it and its great packaging. No damage, not opened. It&#x27;s great to finally have a spray and not pay an ouchy for it. Poor people need things to without the arm and leg.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than &amp;#34;Model In a Bottle&amp;#34;.  It doesn&#x27;t cake up my makeup after a couple hours like Model in bottle does. And it doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes at all!.  It has a weird smell though but it dissipates after a few seconds.</li>
    <li> I like this..I spray on after all makeup is on.</li>
    <li> I love this it works wonders and makes my compact look not powder bought it at target for 3 dollars and many other of their products !!</li>
    <li> This keeps my makeup in place all day, and smells nice, too.</li>
    <li> I Love This, And Affordable</li>
    <li> Works great, I work 12 hour shifts and my makeup stays flawless</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and unscented. I&#x27;m not sure if it really does anything for me but I enjoy using it and have gone through at least 5 of them over the course of time. One lasts me about 3 weeks to a month with a good amount of spraying. The spray bottle, as stated by others, needs work. And I would recommend buying this on the e.l.f website or Walmart.. it&#x27;s $3 there. If it was more than that (i.e. the price on this one) I probably wouldn&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for my skin. It actually makes my skin even more oily throughout the day. Waste of money in my opinion but it probably just depends on what type of skin you have.</li>
    <li> Love this product...makes my face makeup Last all day!</li>
    <li> I sprayed it on my face after make up and I noticed nothing&#x27;s changed. The weather here is pretty dry so I expected that my make up doesn&#x27;t fade 2-3 hours (I don&#x27;t sweat that much). When I used this product I expected that my make up should stay in place but I think it&#x27;s still the same, nothing&#x27;s change. But I still like it though, it&#x27;s okay for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> Left my skin worse than before</li>
    <li> I think this is working! I have used it for 2 days now and it seems like my makeup is staying on longer! I think it is worth the purchase, I will get it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Work very well great product.</li>
    <li> I use liquid foundation, set it with a translucent powder and then do bronzer, and blush (as well as pencil eyebrows and liquid eyeliner).... this is my full make up routine for special occasions..... I got the DEWEY mist, (so i can&#x27;t speak for the matte finish) but the dewy finishing mist gives you a glow to your makeup/foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will definitely buy again when i run out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just make sure you have a solid makeup routine down pat first.... i&#x27;d recommend this to people already comfortable with applying full face foundation whether liquid or powder or both..... or if you just want to experiment this would be fun to play around with too, see what kind of looks you can create..... but if you want to use it straight out of the box and hit the town right after, i&#x27;d recommend this spray for those with prior make up experience in the event of last-minute-use//that is, of course, f you don&#x27;t have time to test i it out first for those with less make up experience.</li>
    <li> keeps my makeup looking flawless all day!  Works just as well as more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It leaves my skin dewey and sets my makeup for the day. Wouldn&#x27;t use if going out on the town, but still good for an average day.</li>
    <li> This product is great. However the bottle really sucks. It was leaking when I received it and it doesn&#x27;t spray an even mist. I did have an empty mist bottle on hand and poured the product in there and now it&#x27;s perfect. It does hold your make up very well!</li>
    <li> When I read the former reviews I sorta believed until I try it myself as you may know everyone has their own perspectives. When it arrived I used it the next day and actually I was amazed that my make-up stayed in place. There were no smudges or make-up on my clothes. My make-up stayed in place all day long and I&#x27;m in the stage of peri-menopause and still my make-up did not run at all. Truly amazing! I highly recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> Very nice mist,lasts all day and feels very refreshing.</li>
    <li> What a miracle spray! Keeps your makeup in place for long time! Love it</li>
    <li> I use it as a refreshing face mist. But really, it doesn&#x27;t work. At all. But at least its cheap so I&#x27;m not too upset about it.</li>
    <li> I use different makeup setting products.  Have used, Urban Decay (too heavy), Skindinavia (like it), and decided to try the e.l.f. brand. I have to say that this has become a favorite.  Very light feel.  Must use a few more sprays than Skindinavia, but definitely like the fee. Almost feels like a water mist.  Sets well.</li>
    <li> I usually really like e.l.f makeup but this didnt seem to be anything more than water.My makeup does stay on ok usually so Mabie i just didnt notice.but in my opinion its not worth a buy.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product because a YouTube video suggested it. I like it and my make up last longer. The spray smells go and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a MUST in your makeup bag/routine. :) Helps makeup to stay put all day.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really say yet, but it does seem to limit the amount of times I have to address the shine on my face.</li>
    <li> Have never used a product like this before but seems to help makeup stay in place longer.</li>
    <li> This is pretty amazing stuff.  I did my make-up, sprayed it on and forgot about it, mainly because usually what happens is that my face starts to feel greasy in the T zone after about an hour and that prompts me to put on powder.  But this time I didn&#x27;t feel greasy for eight hours - incredible!  I tried this out in Indiana in the summer in 97 degree incredibly humid heat, and it STILL worked!  I will tell you that you can&#x27;t rub your face except lightly, because this spray does really set your make-up.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m just spraying water on my face, does not feel like it helps keep my makeup on. Nor looks like it does. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Maybe I applied it wrong but the few times I used it my mascara did horrible things. I did use it according to the instructions and every time it made my mascara yukky. So from now on I&#x27;ll use it way before I apply my mascara.</li>
    <li> Really sets my face nicely.</li>
    <li> Used it a few times, seems to work</li>
    <li> This works beTter than Any other brand I have tried</li>
    <li> Not really sure if it makes a difference or not? :-/</li>
    <li> Was partially unscrewed so it seeped out from under the plastic top wrapper... Was about 1/3 full when I got it. Bummer :(</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have big issues with my make up melting off mid day and when I used this it kept my make up on from the morning to before I washed my face for bed. Amazing!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It definitely makes my makeup last longer.</li>
    <li> works well and is inexpensive</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is an affordable price, and definitely works. Although since buying it, I have found that it is also sold at Meijer &amp; Walmart for around $3.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Hydrates and sets my make up!</li>
    <li> It works very well and I am quite pleased. I reccomend it to any woman (or man of course) who sweats a lot or who does laboring activity that wants their make up to stay on for long periods of time without running.</li>
    <li> It seems like my face was the same when i didn&#x27;t use it, only a little oily... I usually have oily skin, so it didn&#x27;t impress me at all!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like this really set my lipstick like I wanted it to but I suspect my expectations are too high. I still haven&#x27;t managed to get a truly solid bright or dark color when I apply lipstick and I thought this would help, so maybe the problem is my lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This made it feather just a very teeny bit. It dried well, and the lipstick seemed to stay on more when I used a napkin to press my lips against to see how much came off, but eating and drinking still makes the lipstick wear off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use it for eyeshadow, it didn&#x27;t dry as well when I tried. But then, I don&#x27;t really have a need to set my eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Great buy!! Sometimes im on the go early in the morning and no time to wash off the make up i slept in well as horrible as it may sound it lasts from the night before and i mist the spray on a beauty blender and touch up the previous days make up! Its great! Definitely purchasing more!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and product is great. I have used it everyday since I bought it</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described. Thanks for your honesty!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I sprayed some when I first got it, because someone wrote a review and gave it 1 star because they said it didn&#x27;t spray like a mist but more like a stream that messed up there make up. When I sprayed the bottle yes it came out as a stream but the second spray it came out a mist. I think this happens with all squirt bottles. Spray away from your face and spray a second time to get it misty and while the mist is fallin just put your face there and let it fall on your face. You dont have to spray it directly to your face. Other wise this product is fine to me not the greatest or more expensive but it works well.</li>
    <li> I love this face mist. For the price, e.l.f. quality products are always surprisingly Fantastic! Light scent, not a bit sticky, feels refreshing during a steamy afternoon. Oh, almost forgot....It works too! Say bye bye melting make up face!</li>
    <li> (Took this pic after being in the rain coming home falling asleep woke up and took a pic suprised at how much make up stayed I and I barely have any brows mines are filled in) It does work and keeps your makeup set and in place I even fell asleep with my make up on and a good majority of it stayed I was pretty shocked at how good this stuff works and for the people who complain about spraying it and it ruining their makeup they&#x27;re all idiots it cn make your make up run if you dnt follow the directions if you spray too close to your face it&#x27;s almost like a water gun the directions say to hold away and it will fall on your face like a mist and I often stand in front of a fan to make the spray hurry up and dry to set my face this stuff is awesome :-)</li>
    <li> Really love this mist. I always purchase it. It&#x27;s great for my combination skin.</li>
    <li> Gives a great &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look and makes makeup last about 8 hours for me which is perfect. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Definitely works. It helps a lot if you sweat a lot of live in a humid area. It also doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy.</li>
    <li> I honestly recommend this product. It&#x27;s a great setting spray, I look forward to buying more!</li>
    <li> Does nothing waste of money</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy this product again! Saw someone use it in a YouTube makeup tutorial and liked the dewy look I&#x27;d been trying to achieve by patting water on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This must not only serves you dew honey, it gives you face as well. Meaning your makeup is set and you look almost ethereal. My look isn&#x27;t compete without this spray!</li>
    <li> Arrived in 1 day and works great</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this setting spray. It is much cheaper then alot of the higher end brands and works just as well if not better! I wear liquid foundation and powder. I spray this twice on my face in the morning after my makeup and it keeps it in place all day. It smells clean and fresh, no gross chemical smell. This sprays on light, not greasy or overly wet. I only have to use this once in the morning and it stays in place all day!. You cant beat the price! everyone should have this in their collection. it does not break out or cause any irritation to my sensitive skin also. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> At a good price and hold make</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn it at a few outside venues for weddings and parties.... And I love it...for one my eye makeup didn&#x27;t smear!</li>
    <li> Great, i looked how it left my makeup.</li>
    <li> It works! If you are not ready to invest in Urban Decay or other expensive brands, this is just for you! It works perfectly and stays on all day! I went to bed with winged gel liner on (yikes) and I woke up 10 hours later and it was still in a perfect line!</li>
    <li> Love this product is a must have for finish touch</li>
    <li> I was surprised on how good this worked. It keeps my skin dewy and moist . I have very dry skin around the nose area and this helped a bunch. I&#x27;m on my second bottle!</li>
    <li> My expectations were completely fulfilled. terrific product, fixing make-up and allows it to be clean all day....and inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;best regardes</li>
    <li> The spray mist is just as explained, the bottle will last a long time. The product is a good price.</li>
    <li> it works ok, but has a funny smell.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I love to use a product like this but as I am getting older not sure it will not effect my anti aging product. Will update in a few weeks. They were delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This works! Get it for yourself. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, I had my doubts at first but this product is amazing!</li>
    <li> great! does its job, long lasting, not sticky or thick, pleasant light smell.</li>
    <li> I got this as an add-on item with a contour palette and had not heard of a &amp;#34;makeup setter&amp;#34; prior to this. It claims to last ALL day, but like most makeup products that claim this, it does not. However, I did notice it seemed to help it hold up from 3-4 hours. In my opinion, this is all you really need for a night out. It does advise to reapply this through the day/night you apply it and I did not. This product is not &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34; on your face. I liked how light it felt and for someone like me who lives in the south and sweats alot and touches their face, this product held up through it all....just not for as long as it claims. I would still buy again.</li>
    <li> Really set the makeup in place</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for hot weather. It keeps you feeling cool and keeps your makeup in place if you perspire. The smell is mediocre.</li>
    <li> Great product comparable to high end make-up setters. Good for sensitive skin and really keeps make-up set all day.</li>
    <li> Sets my makeup beautifully. Works for me! I love elf products!!!!</li>
    <li> Great setting spray fabulous for before and after makeup applying makes your makeup last all day</li>
    <li> I loved this mist and set spray!! I really does help to keep your makeup in place all day and doesn&#x27;t make the removal of the makeup difficult. I will definitely be buying more from this seller in the future. It came exactly as advertised, no damage, brand new &amp; sealed. Fantastic buy!!</li>
    <li> Love this spray. Hydrates my face perfectly after make-up application.  Must have for any serious make-up user.</li>
    <li> I was happy with how well it set my makeup without further smudging like other products have done, I&#x27;d recommend getting this~</li>
    <li> This is amazing to spray on your eye brushes before picking up eyeshadow and applying. It really intensifies the colors, and the price couldnt get better.</li>
    <li> I use this on a daily basis, no problems at all (hasn&#x27;t made me break out or anything). I love this stuff, I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This helps my makeup stay in place all day and night! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. It really helped me to keep excess makeup off of my collar and clothing. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> knocks the dust off my peach fuzz;0  on the elf site you can purchase this for just 3 bucks and that&#x27;s full price..just saying cause beauty on a budget seeing how expensive it was here I felt compelled to share</li>
    <li> Good. I just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this spray.  I use it to moisten my brunches  and sponges. It really helps to get my makeup to spead faster and easier. I have really oily skin. I do use different products to keep me from being so oily. I have used it alone and it does. Work. But is amazing when used with a setting powder n another setting spray. I only use it to moisten my makeup tools.</li>
    <li> It sure does feel refreshing on the skin</li>
    <li> I saw this product on a YouTube make-up tutorial, I have really dry skin, especially in the winter, make up only seems to dry my face out more, I do think this product made my make-up stay on better while looking more flawless!  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Hey, most of you may have never heard of mist and spray products but let me tell you, they work! Make up stays on much longer and you have a glow after you spray it on. Try it! You&#x27;ll never go without it again!</li>
    <li> I always have issues keeping my makeup looking fresh. I have combination skin (oily and dry) and by the end of the day, it almost looks like my makeup is completely gone. After spraying this on when my makeup was done, it looked fresh all day. Great buy! Will definitely keep ordering thus product!</li>
    <li> DEFINATELY BUYING EVERYTIME I RUN OUT FOR THE REST OF FOREVER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have to redo my make up before work after school but this makes it to wear I DONT HAVE TO AT ALL</li>
    <li> AMAZING! This product really does help keep makeup in place for hours but is also refreshing when touching up makeup throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my face feel so fresh. I sometimes even use it when I don&#x27;t have makeup on to get that fresh feel. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Sets my makeup nicely. Doesnt have a smell. The spray bottle works fine and gives nice coverage. I saw some people had an issue with the spray bottle Im sure you could find a misting bottle at a beauty store.</li>
