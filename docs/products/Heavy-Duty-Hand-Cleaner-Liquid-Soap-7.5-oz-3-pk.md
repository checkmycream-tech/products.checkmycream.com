      <li>I love Lava liquid soap.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>

      <li>I work on motorcycles and this stuff is nothing special.</li>

      <li>This liquid lava fixed that.</li>
      <li>The skin on my hands have been dry and cracked for a long time, I wash my hands all the time all day long, probably more than anyone might need to.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, the three bottles were vacuum sealed together, so the leaking soap only got on the three bottles, not the other items in my shipment.</li>
      <li>As far back as I can remember, I have used Lava soap and I am not about to try or use any substitute.  </li>
      <li>The lava soap is exactly what I had ordered, but one of the bottles had leaked half</li>

    <li> Product description was right on. Great product, works as advertsed. God bless you. Thanks</li>
    <li> second time I&#x27;ve bought this. Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much but I keep telling myself it&#x27;s worth it. DOnt think I&#x27;ll buy these again but it has WD-40 in it so it has to be doing something, right?? I don&#x27;t see much difference between this and hand soap. I work on motorcycles and this stuff is nothing special.</li>
    <li> I use it after I read the newspaper.</li>
    <li> my hands and nails get packed with dirt working in my garden . this is a wonderful product, cleans great, strong with scrubbing beads and smells nice. excellent nail cleaner with a nail brush.  more uses than plain bar lava soap. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Hubby is a contractor and this works great for him!</li>
    <li> Great hand cleaning product. Hard to find in Las Vegas, NV. I do a lot of out door grilling and this product is a must when cleaning my hands</li>
    <li> Arrived fast &amp; as described.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Purchased for use to clean my hands after gardening. Some of the plants have sticky sap which is difficult to remove with regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;My dad used to use Lava soap after work I remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has come a long way -- it still works great, but has a great scent and is not drying to my hands at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning up after working with grease or dirt.</li>
    <li> As far back as I can remember, I have used Lava soap and I am not about to try or use any substitute.  If it works leave it alone!!!</li>
    <li> This product did not work. Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> My huband and son are both farmers ..  they use LAVA liquid daily!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It is best when your hands are dirty or you want to get a smell out of your hands. I cut up fish, garlic, groom my dogs, work on my hot rod and always use lava for these tough jobs.</li>
    <li> Working with machinery and railroad cars all day requires a good hand cleaner; this works well for all our employees!</li>
    <li> So much neater to have it in a pump vs the messy bar I remember my Dad using.  Great to clean up with after yard work.  It&#x27;s not just for men anymore.</li>
    <li> If I was told to go and purchase soap that didn&#x27;t dry your hands out, and kept them moisturized, I would never have thought of getting this soap.&lt;br /&gt;  The skin on my hands have been dry and cracked for a long time, I wash my hands all the time all day long, probably more than anyone might need to.  But since I have been using this Lava soap, I haven&#x27;t had one problem with any dry or cracking skin.  So great product.</li>
    <li> The lava soap is exactly what I had ordered, but one of the bottles had leaked half it&#x27;s contents by the time they arrived. Fortunately, the three bottles were vacuum sealed together, so the leaking soap only got on the three bottles, not the other items in my shipment.</li>
    <li> Great to remove grease and grime that ordinary soap will not.</li>
    <li> Abrasives really help.</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Smooth transaction</li>
    <li> Great product. Timely Delivery!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this liquid Lava soap for years, and I love it. We used to have the bars around when I was growing up, but it&#x27;s only gotten better with the liquid which still cleans the greasiest stains off hands and arms but now has some moisturizers in it so it&#x27;s easy on the skin. It&#x27;s made by the \\&quot;WD-40 Company\\&quot; (it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;contain\\&quot; WD-40) and it&#x27;s a high powered hand cleaning soap that in the liquid version is great in the shop OR the kitchen. Highly recommend for those hand cleanups that are a little tougher..</li>
    <li> Works good... Not worth price though...</li>
    <li> I love Lava hand soap, but I hate the nasty dirty bars of soap sitting in muck on the sink. Finally, Lava in a liquid! I thank you lava &amp; my sink thanks you.</li>
    <li> Best pumice soap available...cant get the pump in any stores!</li>
    <li> Glad I found this in the pump form.  I can only seem to find the bars at the store.  We are DIY people and this soap has pumice pieces and really helps clean up grease, glue, or whatever dirt we happen to get into.  It also has a better scent (more regular-soap scent) than some of the other hand cleaners out there.  My grandpa used this way back when, so I&#x27;ve been using this a long time.</li>
    <li> good soap price was good on it works well for dirty hands</li>
    <li> great service good product</li>
    <li> What can I say? I love Lava liquid soap. It cleans garden-filthy hands like nothing else can do.</li>
    <li> Reviewing this for my boyfriend, the diesel mechanic. Said it works far better than the bar soap, he uses it in conjunction with dawn for very greasy days. He used to use the bars but still had break dust in the creases of his hands and neck. This liquid lava fixed that. Can now have white sheets again!!</li>
