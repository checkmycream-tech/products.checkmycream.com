    <li> Have a pain you can not get rid of this works -</li>
    <li> Merry Hempsters - Hot Hemp Rub.  I use it after I shower on my lower back and in most case the pain goes away.  I have been using it for better than five years and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> has a strong aroma of spices, cloves etc. if you are sensitive to fragrences, bear that in mind.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. Almost instant pain relief. Size makes it perfect to carry with you wherever you go. I love it.</li>
    <li> Not Hot!! not even warm don&#x27;t buy does nothing at all !!!</li>
    <li> i have a pinched nerve and slipped disk in my neck. there is no medication that helps. desperate and in the worst pain i have ever experienced, i went to a local natural foods store, told her my story and asked for their guidance. this is what she gave me. i havent had this much mobility, gone this long without a severe headache, since i was a teenager (when i had the original injury). it is so worth a try! (just be sure to avoid the eye area and thoroughly wash your hands when you are done)</li>
    <li> This helps to relieve my back pain. It gets into the muscles and give me relief when my back really hurts.  I like the cooling sensation you feel from this.</li>
    <li> Works well and in my view much superior to icy hot, tiger balm etc.  downside is a very small size and lack of prime shipping.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my sore knees. Because of the strong smell, I couldn&#x27;t really stand to use it there so I can&#x27;t say whether or not it will help with that kind of pain. I also have Morton&#x27;s neuroma on my left foot and this works great to calm the nerve down when it is throbbing. It doesn&#x27;t cure anything but it eases the pain so that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at night when I&#x27;m trying to sleep. I do wish it didn&#x27;t have such a strong odor.</li>
    <li> use it daily and love product</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I have used it for years.  HOT.  Seems hotter when applied to recently washed skin.  Recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years!  It is so nice to have a rub that you can keep in your purse and rub on without getting your hands messy. And I like the smell.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what was described. It however didn&#x27;t work well for me as it didn&#x27;t last as long as I needed it to. I would say within 20 minutes I could no longer feel the benifits. But it is hard for me to find a run that actually works like I WANT it to. I even liked the smell! There was no need to rate this down due to my preference. If you have mild pain...I do think this would work well for you.</li>
    <li> Works well for sore muscles - my husband likes the hot hemp a little better than the cool hemp rub for his needs. But both are good.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different types of muscle rubs.  None compare to this brand.  I have had both the hot (red) and cool (green) and I love both equally.  It does have a sort of strong scent to it that does ware off after an hour ... Nothing you cant tolerate or anyone else and its not a bad scent either. Best part is that it works pretty quickly. It looks and works like a large chap stick.  I have used one tube for all real sore muscles and real bad neck tension.  It has lasted for a good half year or more.  A little can go a long way.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t touch your eyes after using it and washing your hands for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT STUFF THANK WHOEVER AND FOR THE GREAT PRICE TOO.</li>
    <li> I liked it better when it was a thicker composition, but this still works quite well.  It just seems to run out quicker.</li>
    <li> Instant relief of muscle aches. My pilates teacher put me on to this stuff and it work soooo well. My whole family now swears by it.</li>
    <li> Feels great, love the smell.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream on every type of external pain.  WOW It works on knees, ankles, leg cramps, back aches, you name it.  It is great product.</li>
