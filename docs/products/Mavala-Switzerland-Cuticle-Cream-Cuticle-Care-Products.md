    <li> I use it every night and my cuticles have never looked this good. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best cuticle cream that I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried the liquid polishes.  The nails look newly painted, but the cuticles are not as soft as with this cream.  I have skin around my thumbs that within a few days of my manicure look like like I need another manicure.  I don&#x27;t with this cream and because I only get a manicure every 4 weeks, now that i am using Gel, my manicure always looks fresh.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Winters in Chicago are so hard on my hands and cuticles.  Add to that, I have a job where I&#x27;m washing my hands or using a hand sanitizer constantly.  My poor hands get very dry.  My cuticles crack and often bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A coworker had turned me on to the Mavala nail hardener, and I saw this, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  No hand lotion has ever helped, so for the investment, I thought I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff rocks.  Within a few days my cuticles were healed and moisturized.  I stopped having peeling cuticles, and my hands looked healthy again.  This stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a try!  Do follow the recommendation of putting it on at night so it can absorb.  I will sometimes put it on twice a day (once when I get up and once before bed) when my hands were really bad.  Just remember, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Cream great for cuticles, greasy feel doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly. lingering scent that takes quite awhile to get used to. If it wasn&#x27;t so good for the cuticles, probably would not use due to the scent.</li>
    <li> the only thing your kid may notice is the strange taste that this cream has. it is not sticky, I mean ur kid may wipe it away.&lt;br /&gt;even he/she suck his finger and handle its moderate stage taste.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all and this is the very best cuticle and nail cream. t can instantly make your nail bed look great and it has a wonderful aroma. I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Nice, pleasant smelling product.  A little goes a long way in keep your cuticles in check.  I have very dry cuticles and this is helping with dryness.</li>
    <li> My fingers are very dry so this cream helps me soften them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order it again and again.</li>
    <li> This is a product I used exclusively in Europe when I lived there.  now I find it here on Amazon....it is an amazing product as are the rest of their offerings.  Thank you Mavala for making it available here in usa.</li>
    <li> I have been trying for a very long time to find something to replace the cream that Revlon stopped making. This was probably the sixth thing I tried. I thought that all it did was make my hands greasy, didn&#x27;t make them moisturized or healed. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Terrific product - best I&#x27;ve ever used for very unruly cuticles</li>
    <li> just what I was hoping for</li>
    <li> This smells so good and really softens the cuticle. You don&#x27;t need a lot as it is very thick. I think I need to purchase more to have at different locations.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product while visiting my son in Montreal a few years ago---I am glad to have access to it here in the US</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and is a great cuticle cream. Cuticles are still moisturized after I wash my hands! Only 4 stars because its a little expensive but you don&#x27;t need a lot so should last a long time.</li>
    <li> An amazing product. Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great product. I really enjoy the smell.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and the smell of this cream! Twice a day and anyone can grow health beautiful nails and keep their cuticles looking gorgeous.</li>
