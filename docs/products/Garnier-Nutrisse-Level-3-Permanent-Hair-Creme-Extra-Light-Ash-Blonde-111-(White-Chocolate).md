      <li>What I was left with is the most healthy and conditioned color</li>
      <li>end up super gold-y</li>
      <li>I have tried many ash blonde hair colors, perfect 10 left my hair with unwanted reddish highlights, Clairol loving care was very damaging, Johnathan Freida had uneven coverage, but I love this shade</li>
      <li>I used this about a month and a half after I had used another L&#x27;Oreal hair color product that had gotten great reviews and mentions about it not resulting in brassiness.</li>
      <li>YAY for NATRAL LOOKING, might not be the same exact shade in the picture but its definately GOOD looking.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I want to write this review, because the only reason I had the courage to try this hair color was due to the hundreds of online reviews I read first, and the most helpful were hands down on here.  THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.  I am seriously in shock that my hair came out the way it did.  I am naturally a strawberry blonde, have been getting highlights for 15 years.  Used box kits about 10 years ago when I was younger and could not afford to get my hair done.  Well a few cities and about 10 stylists later, I have still not been able to find someone who can make me the blonde I want.  BUT THIS PRODUCT CAN!  I left it on for 45-50 minutes, so longer than the directions say but - don&#x27;t worry.  If anything it just lifts a little more blonde.  While it was processing I read more reviews - some bad, that said hair turned gray or blue - and had a minor panic attack, but kept with it and after 50 mins rinsed it out, used the condition, and got out of the shower.  In the mirror, I didn&#x27;t see any change to my hair color - looked basically the same as it was before I put the dye in.  And I saw what looked to be a little orange-y at the roots.  But nothing drastic.  I thought oh well, at least it didn&#x27;t do anything awful - so I blow-dried my hair, straightened it with the flat iron and - WOW!!!! What a difference - it is exactly the color on the box!! I could not be happier, and for $6.99 to boot.  My hair feels amazing, it looks white blonde in the sunlight (exactly what I wanted) and I will definitely be using the product over and over again.  Enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I tried this hair color after lifting my hair to a dark, brassy blonde hoping that the extra light ash blonde would counteract my brass. I had read pretty good things about it online and was excited to try it. This was my first Garnier Nutrisse hair dye ever and I was pleased to see a large developer bottle, but was disappointed when I realized there is not enough product to actually fill it. Bummer #1.&lt;br /&gt;Something I wasn&#x27;t expecting at all was the horrible smell. I thought this stuff was supposed to smell better than other dyes? Nope, the chemicals actually stung my nostrils and it was awful. My hair actually still smells faintly like it two showers later...&lt;br /&gt;I did, however, like the consistency of the color creme. It was nice and thick, making it easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product did nothing to my hair - it was still just as brassy and dark after using it. This was majorly disappointing especially considering I paid more for this dye than I typically do for my preferred brand. Oh well, you live &amp; learn I guess.</li>
    <li> my favorite color! hair feels great!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dye I have ever used. It brings my hair to a very LIGHT ash blond WITH NO RED. I have used Paul Mitchell and found it to be terrible, so I came back to this and will use it from now on. It goes on nice and doesn&#x27;t cause burning. It it a very quick process.</li>
    <li> I was terrified to dye my own hair. I had some very bad experiences in the past. But I was tired of paying $100 every time I went to the salon, especially in this economy and with two small children. I tried this product and left it in for 45 minutes, not 20 or 30 like they recommend. I think it will not work if you leave it in for less than that unless u have really light hair. My hair is bleach blonde and my husband says it looks great.</li>
    <li> I have medium brown hair and color my hair blond.  When a was very young, my hair was ash blonde.  Despite this fact, my hair always wants to be brassy/gold whenever I color it blond.  I have tried almost every single over the counter hair color available - many claim to be \\&quot;high lift\\&quot; color but I just don&#x27;t see it.  This product is great - gives super high lift and removes almost all of the brassy gold color in my hair - this is an extra light ash blonde color, very flattering for cool skin tones (if you look better in blue/purple colors rather than orange/yellow colors, you are a cool skin tone).  They stopped carrying this in stores, not sure why, so I just loaded up on this from Amazon.  Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m naturally dark blonde Swedish, but wanted to lighten it a little extra - I&#x27;ve tried 10+ different colours after moving to the U.S. and my hair Always turns out yellow or yellowish. THIS is the only product I&#x27;ve used for 1 year+ now as it&#x27;s the only one (as far as I know) that just simply lightens it… For me people just ask if I&#x27;ve been at the beach, and friends and bf don&#x27;t notice a difference:)  Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a few years since I&#x27;ve used box hair color, and I was nervous to try it again... more often then not, my dirty blonde hair ended up with tons of brass, accompanied by split ends and damage. So with this color I really expected brassiness, but it actually turned out surprisingly nice. A pale blonde (like the picture) on the top layer where my light blonde highlights used to be, and a pretty, darker ashy blonde shade underneath (where my hair was a medium brown color).    As the color was developing, I was worried it wasn&#x27;t lifting enough as it seemed somewhat dark, so I kept it on for 45 minutes instead of the prescribed 30 minutes... it did lighten up, much to my satisfaction... and with NO brassiness. Damage seemed minimal, as well.      If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve been scared away from box blonde hair color thanks to a lot of bad experiences with brassiness- but Garnier Nutrisse White Chocolate is different, a true ashy blonde color. No need to go to the salon to get that pretty pale blonde shade you&#x27;re looking for (although 9 times out of 10 my upscale salon can&#x27;t get blonde right either), just give this color a try!    EDITED TO ADD: By the way, I completely forgot to mix the avocado oil that comes with it. I thought it was supposed to be used at the end, like a conditioner... I was a little worried until I read the ingredients, and all it does it add fragrance. So if you skip that step, it&#x27;s no biggie.</li>
    <li> I stay away from boxed hair dyes like they are radiation. With every ounce of my being I WONT use a box. I have dark blond ashy hair that costs me hundreds of dollars a year to make a nice light blond. Well, I&#x27;ve been going to the hair school down the road from me to save $$ but (I&#x27;m sorry) they suck at color. My hair has been an awful golden-yellow blond for months and I just couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. I don&#x27;t have $$ to go professional so I did research online for what I should do for someone with my hair (Brassy, golden, yellow blond-yuk!) So I bought this(at Wal-mart) and was practically shaking putting it in my hair, I was so nervous about the outcome-afraid my hair might turn green or purple! Um....NOPE!!! I will continue to use this!! My hair truly looks wonderful-it&#x27;s a nice light blond-NO yellow. It&#x27;s cool in color and just looks amazing. I dyed over roots, toner, and previous highlights(the work of about a half a year) Seriously! I don&#x27;t know what it will do for you, but if the previous people had such results as I did, you will be so glad you spent, what, 8 bucks?? Totally worth it. Waiting to see what my husband says when he gets home!!! I just want to add my color did not turn the color on the box exactly but it came very close. I left it in for 30 minutes. I have med length hair and would almost recommend getting 2 boxes...I will next time, anyway. I hope this helps :-) Good luck in your search for the perfect blond- it&#x27;s hard, but this color came out awesome!  ---Jen</li>
    <li> This gives WONDERFUL light being blond hair color/ I left it on longer with no ill effects. I have mixed gray and brown hair, however was blond until about 16. I purchased a &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; shampoo to keep it from getting red.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy the anti-brassy die and leave it on longer than recommended.  The reviews for this product are helpful. Bestlight ash blond I have used. I did not need to strip my hair first, but then it is not very dark.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this. So much that I used it twice within a few weeks. And it didn&#x27;t lighten my hair at all.. I had high hopes after reading so many awesome reviews. I have dark blonde hair, so I figured it would lighten it really well. But you could barely see a slight difference. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I have tried a gajillion brands colors, even lightening kits and hair color with the highest peroxide available at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and this over the counter brand is THEE VERY BEST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally dark brown to soft black hair.  YES it is THAT dark. My hair is beginning to show platinum strands and I had never been blonde.  I did use a stylist/colorist to do the gradual lightening process over 1 year so people could still recognize me.  :)  I use this box to lighten my roots over 3 months until I get in for the $100+ salon professional lightening.  I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how awesome I think this product is.  It smells good and my TOTALLY fake blonde hair is healthy and SOFT after I use the conditioner.  My hair is the same color as Kelly Ripa&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will share with you that I tried the FERIA Extra BLONDE #205 lightening kit just yesterday, and like the REVIEWS all state, it turned my hair orange.  NO EXAGGERATION, it was bonafide ORANGE, the kind of orange you used to get in those little cups of 1/2 orange and 1/2 vanilla ice cream when you were a kid.  YES. Obnoxious orange.  Today I went and bought a box of this in hopes that it would rescue my hair and indeed it did.  Since I JUST PROCESSED my hair yesterday with FERIA, I left the color on from Garnier a much SHORTER TIME than normal.  Only 15 mins.  When I leave it on when I haven&#x27;t tried another product on my normal color schedule (approx every 3 weeks) I leave it on for 40 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned, I will stick with this and be loyal to what works for me. :) THANK YOU GARNIER!!!  You saved me from my CARROT TOP head!</li>
    <li> I have dirty ash blonde hair. I hate how dull it looks so I lighten it. I&#x27;ve used lots of box dyes and none were perfect, I always had to use toner or purple shampoo to make it a nice cool/ash color.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find that this shade is a one stop shop! It comes out perfect the first time. a perfect natural looking cool blonde. It smells better than most too which is a plus. I do leave it on for a little bit longer than called for. It usually says 25 mins and I might do it for 35 or so.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes though: I highlight my hair too, so sometimes my highlights turn out a little blue but a couple washes later with some clarifying shampoo and my hair looks PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;Also: if your hair is longer than about shoulder length, you should probably buy two boxes. Yeah, its more expensive but its waaay cheaper than the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy dying!!!  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m naturally dark blonde and this turned my hair blue.&lt;br /&gt;I did everything according to the instructions and I now look like I have had a blue rinse.</li>
    <li> This hair dye is amazing! It gave me perfect baby blond results like on the box, not brassy at all. I have dark blond hair and this hair dye worked perfectly on my hair. My results turned out like the box. Not brassy at all. All other hair dyes always left my hair brassy, but this one did not.</li>
    <li> White Chocolate by Garnier is like no other color, my hair has NEVER looked so blonde, so healthy and it&#x27;s so easy. I have brown hair and I have used bleach, Clairol, L&#x27;oreal, and been to the best salons in Los Angeles and San Fransisco AND NEVER have I liked my hair this much. Thank you Garnier. I remember one time at Fred Segal my Stylist was doing my hair and he had a representation deal with Garnier, that day he used some of the products on me, and I should have known what a company Ganier is, they are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I put the color onto my brown roots for 30 minutes, then the rest of my blonde colored hair another 30 minutes. Took a shower (If you tend to go brassy take Garnier Herbashine haiir color in 900, light natural blonde as a toner in the shower after washing your White Chocolate off for 10 minutes) What I was left with is the most healthy and conditioned color and I am so happy.</li>
    <li> My daughter use this color if you looking for sexy blonde, natural and keep the color longer. I recommend. If you blonde color turn orange use this one.</li>
    <li> Finally! I&#x27;m a natural dark blonde who has been dying her hair for years.  I recently quit dying and let my hair grow out. Once it was all my natural color I went red, which eventually faded to a chesnut brown.  Wanting to go blonde again, I bleached it and then dyed it a dark ash blonde (different brand hairdye).  However, it was still darker than I wanted and it had a lot of orange tint to it.  I decided to try this color.  I read somewhere that it lightens up to 3 shades, and I would agree that&#x27;s true.  It lighted it wonderfully and there&#x27;s absolutely no orange in it! Very happy!</li>
    <li> used this to get white hair after bleaching black hair 3 times</li>
    <li> I have used this color many times on both untreated and color treated hair.   GOOD: Hair feels soft and shiny after using, much better than other box products I&#x27;ve used. Lifts and deposits, has a blue base so helps with red tones.  BAD: Often not strong enough for color treated hair. Only partially lifts color. Also ,fades quite quickly to brassy tones and will need touching up or toning frequently. For 8 bucks, not bad!  Shown in pics, 30 minutes is not enough on color treated hair to lift all red tones out. I would recommend longer if you have a dark or red base.</li>
    <li> I love this haircolor because the shade is beautiful and unlike every other high-lift blonde I have tried, this one does not stink up my hair.  That&#x27;s really important if you have a husband who hates the smell of dye.  Other brands of this shade will smell bad even through 3 shampoos, but this one is not bad at all.  It comes with a little packet of fruit oil that smells to help.  Also the color is beautiful.  I have thick, dark blonde hair naturally that is very hard to dye.  I have double-bleached in the past and ended up with nothing but neon orange, yet somehow this stuff gets my hair blonde in one step with MUCH less damage!  It is not as light as on the box, but if I use it twice it is close, and it&#x27;s a very pretty color either way.  I got lots of compliments from people who thought I naturally had the same shade of blonde as my little kids.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had so many great reviews, and I didn&#x27;t want to bleach my hair. I have used bleach in the past and it just turns ORANGE/RED, horrible. I did a lot of research and I found this, and to be honest I was really excited and optimistic to try it. Naturally my hair is a dark ash blonde, but I been dying it medium brown for years. That could be the problem, I guess I would have to go to the salon to get the look I desire :(&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it smells really good and is easy to apply, its not messy like some other dyes, but it didn&#x27;t even lighten my hair a little bit!</li>
    <li> I am constantly struggling with my roots, I have dark ash blonde color. I go to the salon and then they get it too white, or orange, ect... Toner is ushally a MUST... and then they just end up washing out anyways. This color lifted my roots to match the rest wonderfully. It was less stressful on my hair than getting it done by a professional! I would highly recomend this to anyone who wants to be self sufficient and save money...Especially those of you who have those stuborn red undertones! Im hooked and gonna stock up! YAY for NATRAL LOOKING, might not be the same exact shade in the picture but its definately GOOD looking.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair. I left this on for 30 minutes and it is orange! I look like Lindsay Lohan!</li>
    <li> I used this about a month and a half after I had used another L&#x27;Oreal hair color product that had gotten great reviews and mentions about it not resulting in brassiness. Didn&#x27;t work for me however, even with the addition of  some &amp;#34;red out&amp;#34; or red gold corrector additive drops (my roots were particularly orange afterwards). My hair is naturally a very ashy, dark blonde, and whenever I use boxed colors they tend to make my hair too yellowy and brassy. This, however, was a pleasant surprise. I still used the additive drops, but the result was much cooler, and much closer to what I have always tried to achieve in the past.</li>
    <li> I used this for an ombre let me mention I did already have a dark blonde hair I would say this lightened up my hair by 3 levels it did not lift that much but it left my hair in better condition than it was before like way better my hair feels amazing I reccomend this product to people who already have a blonde shade that needs some toning however I do not reccomend if you&#x27;re expecting a bleach platinum look that is not going to happen with this product unless you&#x27;re already a pale blonde ! Over all happy with my results !</li>
    <li> Best blonde box color/toner!  So happy I bought this to touch up my roots.  Usually touch ups done with a box or just with bleach end up super gold-y and I have to buy a toner from Sally&#x27;s to make it match the rest of my light blonde hair but this matched perfectly!  I left it on about 25 minutes (just roots!) and it left me with perfect, light ash blond hair.  Make sure not to put it over already bleached hair though, it will turn blue/gray...not a huge problem though if it does it will wash out after a few shampoos.  Highly recommend this for those who are already blonde and want to eliminate gold/brassy tones.</li>
    <li> Great hair color @ a great price, thank you!</li>
    <li> i had orange bleach blonde hair and it turned my hair completely grey i hate it! a waste of money</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite blonde</li>
    <li> IMPOSSIBLE to find &amp;#34;White Chocolate&amp;#34; locally where I live, but abundant and at a good price here.  Thanks Amazon!  They have a long shelf life so I bought a bunch and stored them. Excellent product and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I have tried many ash blonde hair colors, perfect 10 left my hair with unwanted reddish highlights, Clairol loving care was very damaging, Johnathan Freida had uneven coverage, but I love this shade #111 White chocolate-a perfect light ash blond with no red or brassy highlights and good coverage. Since my hair grabs color quickly I cut five minutes off the suggested time and reduced the 5 minutes on the ends to three and for me it seemed to work well. Hope the color lasts as I am a daily hair washer. I use this to cover grey and lighten. Very please with the results so far.. will have to get back to you on how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I have been going to a lot of stores trying to find my color and I was finally able to get it here and at an excellent price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  I could not always find the shade I wanted at the store, so I solved that problem by buying a case online.</li>
    <li> Great price - does a good job - am a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, good result.</li>
    <li> I used to try to get my hair as white as I could.  It was too much work and sometimes the violet would not leave my hair white, but grey.  Really frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I remember the White Chocolate.  But, I used it in California once and couldn&#x27;t find what brand made it until I searched&lt;br /&gt;for it in Amazon.  I&#x27;ve since gotten 5 of these boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I only use it once every 5-6 weeks, I simply love it.  It is so great that the conditioning lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Garnier Nutrisse.</li>
    <li> I buy this by the bucket so was amazed to get it at this price.  Arrived superfast too.  Another great amazon bargain.</li>
    <li> I used this product yesterday and it turned my dark auburn hair to a light bright medium golden blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and applied the product to my hair and then waited an hour and a half. I know that the instructions say to wait 30 minutes. I waited longer than that because I normally have black hair and I know to take black to blonde that it takes longer then 30 minutes. I watched my hair go from dark auburn to light auburn to orange....knowing that orange turns into gold/ yellow I left the product on longer. If i waited for another hour I would of reached the light ash blonde thats on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Instead, I washed out the product put in the conditioner, looked in the mirror and smiled. I actually liked the color...it is a medium golden blonde. I wanted a summer hair color and I achieved it. So happy with this product that I will used it again. The great part is that it nourishes my hair and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes plus it smells great. Love it!</li>
    <li> comes out alot darker than advertised</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have a ton of natural red, in my hair. So, when trying to go blonde with dye, I usually end up with a ton of orange. Not with this!! It came out an amazing shade of blonde! After using this, I will NOT be buying any other hair color. It is perfect!!</li>
    <li> This worked well on my moms hair.</li>
    <li> I have to rave about what an amazing hair dye this is. I prayed my hair didn&#x27;t fall off . I had such a bad experiences with box hair dyes. for years i go to salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pay over 250 or more to look orange blonde. last time I went to Andy Lecompte being desperate and thought they will get it right. I mean the clients are Nicole Richie, kim k.  well... no my hair still looked brassy. I have light brown hair and I was blonde when I was a kid . as I grew older it got darker but still not too dark. I have this hidden hue. every single dying process it turns orangey reddish weird blonde.&lt;br /&gt;so I made some serious search after not having time to spend 3 hours and $$$$ at the salon. first I bleached my hair and got my usual orangey blonde :/&lt;br /&gt;THAN i used purple shampoo by shwarzkopf ...  still looked like sorry attempt of blonde but better . i used loreal brass banisher.....maybe slight improvement sooo i waited than i read reviews about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just dyed my hair today. i only left it for 30 minutes and i have gorgeous ,shinny long Brittney spears blonde hair. I love love love this color. i still have tiny bit of brassy colors and i think its due to my sloppy application of the dye. but nothing silver shampoo wouldn&#x27;t take care of. no more spending all those hours and $$$ at a salon. im so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the color looks very accurate to the photo.</li>
    <li> i loved my hair right after i used it. the only bad thing is that after a few washes, less than four, the color did not look the same :/ it doesnt last.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened I&#x27;ve used this brand before it turned my roots golden and stripped the color to almost white the bottom half of my hair.  I just had to order a different dye and I hope it fixes it.  I look like I have gray hair for the bottom half of my hair then I have a golden blonde on top.</li>
    <li> It came very fast and looked great on my hair!</li>
    <li> If you have dark brown hair it will not make a difference at all. You will have to use bleach before using this. :)</li>
    <li> This bleach is not bad by any means! It worked very fast  (although it was quite drying, but the conditioner helped this) but did not turn my naturally black hair blond. Instead my hair turned my hair a very light brown. Like a honey blond of some sort (left product on for 30-45 minutes). The conditioner was AMAZING! It made my hair feel so silky and restored any dryness caused by the bleaching process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to re bleach my hair soon but I really did like this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered one box of this extra light ash blonde and did a strand test to see what it would like on my hair which is dyed with light ash brown hair color.  It doesn&#x27;t make much of a change over previously dyed hair.  I think that you have to use some other product first to remove the old color before you use this.  I used to color my natural hair color with a similar color made by Loreal years ago and it turned my hair medium warm blonde which is what I was thinking about trying.  My hair is now dyed light ash brown color and my roots are gray and brown.  This product did seem to condition the strand of hair very well though.  Don&#x27;t expect this to turn your hair light blonde if it&#x27;s been previously dyed.  It probably would if you put it over untouched naturally brown hair that hasn&#x27;t been dyed.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair any blonder, my hair is still an orangy color :l I was expecting a little more</li>
    <li> Great item! Best non-brassy blond I have found.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple weeks ago and my hair has been lightened then and it still is keeping its color. I had light brown/dark blonde roots and I have some strawberry blonde undertones naturally when summer. I had my hair heavily highlighted and it was not light enough for me nor was my hair in great condition, like Garnier always leaves my hair. It was damaged and even worth people shampoo and deep conditioner everyday, my hair was still golden and not lighter. I went back and forth on reviews on here, weeks and weeks. I&#x27;ve tried this before on dyed Brown hair a long time ago( I know bad idea) and it made it weird and damaged. I even color oopsed my hair then used this, but I think my color oxidized, even though I did everything right, including protein filler. Just didn&#x27;t lift. So I was very skeptical, but I took a leap of faith from getting sick of reading reviews, bought two boxes, one loreal, the other, this one. I was so scared of messing up my highlights. I used this one first, if it didn&#x27;t work I would use the loreal that had better reviews to hopefully correct it.  I&#x27;m so happy with my results. Much lighter, my highlights did turn silver blue because of thelightening, but nothing a shower couldn&#x27;t fix. My highlights are white chocolate and make my hair looks even lighter.  ;) I&#x27;m going to use it again tomorrow and I can&#x27;t wait to see my results!!! Im not satisfied till its the color I want haha. Oh, ive been every shade of color under the sun too, so im picky with color. Has to be rich and perfect.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair color, I have naturally dirty dish water blonde hair and my hair color comes out pretty close to the girl on the box.</li>
    <li> I use this color on my dark brown hair to lift it up a few shades!  Works great, and does not turn my hair brassy at all!</li>
    <li> i naturally have very ashy dark blonde hair and in the summer the sun bleaches it to almost white. throughout the colder seasons I pay about $200 each time to get it highlighted until im back in the sun again because my natural and sunless color contrasts it. I have NEVER used box color before and was horrified. This color did make my roots a little bit more golden than anticipated but made it a beautiful color very similar to the box. If you have previously done highlights, which i do, be careful because it will look like your highlights have a slight blue rinse.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dark auburn hair and I knew my hair color was not going  to come out like it is on the box. I did not want it to come out the same color, I just wanted my hair lightened. That&#x27;s exactly what happened, although it did not lighten to any shade of blond for me, but a lighter shade of my already auburn hair: reddish. I suppose I should have kept it on for longer than what the instructions told me to, as my hair cuticles might be a little harder to penetrate with color the average. But decent price. Decent shipping time.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin curly and damaged hair that also has a lot of red in it. This Color is beautiful it took out the ugly red and my hair is soft an shiny. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my standard color.  I love it,  but it is hard to find</li>
