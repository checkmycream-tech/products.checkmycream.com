      <li>Very pleased with product.</li>
      <li>I love this mousse!</li>
      <li>Nice scent too.</li>
      <li>I have the kind hair that does as it pleases.</li>
      <li>Used Vidal Sassoon products years ago, loved them then, love them now.  </li>
      <li>Overall, great price and good product!</li>
      <li>Love it, it hold my curls</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK; nothing special.  </li>
      <li>It has a light texture although curls up, calm the fizz, holds all day, or longer if you don&#x27;t sleep! :)</li>
      <li>Thought to try it since I found it on a deal but ended up buying pantene right after and not using any more.</li>
      <li>This is the best mousse I used for my thick hair when I leave it curly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too heavy for my baby fine hair, but would probably work great for thicker or curly hair.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and does seem to hold my hair in place better than a lot of other hair care products.</li>
      <li>Not the best mousse, but I have had worse mousse that I have purchased.  </li>
      <li>It defined my waves beautifully and didn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy at all like others I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
      <li>I used this mousse for the first time alongside my two other go to hair products and all I can say is WOW, what a great hair day.</li>
      <li>most days wavy but ALWAYS frizzy unless I flat iron it.</li>
      <li>My hair did feel a little sticky but the visual result was great</li>
      <li>My hair is super frizzy and many mousses can&#x27;t tame it, but this does it well and very inexpensively.</li>
      <li>This mousse works really well.</li>
      <li>No matter how many different mousses I try, I always go back to Vidal Sassoon.  </li>
      <li>Works well even in high humidity.</li>
      <li>I have fine long hair, and this made my hair oily and flat ie.</li>
      <li>This mousse holds well and makes my hair feel smooth and bouncy, but by the end of the day it looks greasy and limp.</li>
      <li>Definitely adds volume to my limp, fine hair and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>However, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately in ANY of my local stores</li>
      <li>I have hair with multiple personalities, some days it&#x27;s fairly straight, other days curly,</li>

<li> It is thick and stubborn.</li>
<li> Also, it is very hard to get the mousse out when you press the pump.</li>

    <li> Not easy to find in the stores.  No matter how many different mousses I try, I always go back to Vidal Sassoon.  It&#x27;s my mousse forever.</li>
    <li> I have the kind hair that does as it pleases. It is thick and stubborn. This mousse has helped me to control my unmanageable hair. It has a nice smell and does seem to hold my hair in place better than a lot of other hair care products. It does not make my hair sticky or greasy which is another good aspect of this product. I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> This mousse works really well. My hair is super frizzy and many mousses can&#x27;t tame it, but this does it well and very inexpensively. Works well even in high humidity.</li>
    <li> works like a mousse should</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> Love it, it hold my curls really well keeps them firm.</li>
    <li> I love this mousse! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve tried that works well for scrunching my crazy hair and actually holding it. I&#x27;ve tried literally everything that costs under $10 at Walmart and nothing else works on my hair. However, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately in ANY of my local stores so I&#x27;m happy to see it&#x27;s on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Product works well with my normal/wavy hair! Nice scent too.</li>
    <li> I have hair with multiple personalities, some days it&#x27;s fairly straight, other days curly, most days wavy but ALWAYS frizzy unless I flat iron it. I used this mousse for the first time alongside my two other go to hair products and all I can say is WOW, what a great hair day. It defined my waves beautifully and didn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy at all like others I&#x27;ve tried in the past. My hair did feel a little sticky but the visual result was great and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is the best mousse I used for my thick hair when I leave it curly. It has a light texture although curls up, calm the fizz, holds all day, or longer if you don&#x27;t sleep! :)&lt;br /&gt;I have gone back and forth trying other brands, none was as good as this one.</li>
    <li> Definitely adds volume to my limp, fine hair and it lasts all day. Gave it 4 stars out of 5 because I do feel a stickiness every once in awhile (not after every use though).</li>
    <li> I bought this at the store when they didn&#x27;t have the mousse I usually use in stock.  It&#x27;s OK; nothing special.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Also, it is very hard to get the mousse out when you press the pump.</li>

    <li> Not the best mousse, but I have had worse mousse that I have purchased.  It is a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> FIrm hold - reduces friz.  This is a nie mousse - only downside is it make the hair &#x27;crunchy&#x27;.  I let my hair dry, then i scrunch the dry hair and this removes the &#x27;crunch&#x27; from the hair.  Overall, great price and good product!</li>
    <li> I have fine long hair, and this made my hair oily and flat ie. no volume. Thought to try it since I found it on a deal but ended up buying pantene right after and not using any more.</li>
    <li> This mousse holds well and makes my hair feel smooth and bouncy, but by the end of the day it looks greasy and limp. It&#x27;s too heavy for my baby fine hair, but would probably work great for thicker or curly hair.</li>
