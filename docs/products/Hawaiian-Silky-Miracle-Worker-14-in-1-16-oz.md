      <li>and she showed me this amazing product</li>
      <li>It doesnt even smell nice.</li>
      <li>Honestly, my twist outs have been staying moisturized</li>
      <li>First impression: it smells SOOOO good!</li>
      <li>And it has a pleasant fragrance, different from the Biosilk, but still very pleasant.</li>
      <li>excellent product for natural hair.</li>
      <li>it moisturizes easy to use, smells nice...</li>
      <li>very fine straight fly away hair.  </li>
      <li>I used this product and for lack of a better term...</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this product, but it&#x27;s just okay for me.</li>
      <li>I have tried alot of different products and this one seems to be the best, I would recommend this product to everyone</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it, and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
      <li>I love the fact I don&#x27;t even have to use it every day and</li>
      <li>But, when I combined Hawaiian Silky with Coconut oil, I had better results, so that may help as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can see the definition of my curls better.  </li>
      <li>If it helps keep your hair healthy (which should be your goal, not just length or avoiding &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients)</li>
      <li>Anyway, I love this product.  </li>
      <li>takes out the ouch in the tender head kiddo :)</li>
      <li>I think if you have thinner hair you will love it even more.  </li>
      <li>If it helps keep your hair healthy (which should be your goal, not just length or avoiding &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>so I LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>But, when I combined Hawaiian Silky with Coconut oil, I had better results, so that may help as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this product i already bought 3 more bottles :)</li>
      <li>Thought I&#x27;d never be able to comb through it.</li>
      <li>its an ok product it dose what it say it will do</li>
      <li>Try it and love it.</li>
      <li>I really do love this product.</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>There is a special kind of feeling you get when you buy a product you&#x27;ve never tried before</li>
      <li>Good price, smells amazing, and leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I do shop on Amazon for things I can&#x27;t get in the stores, but this product was something I saw at Sally&#x27;s at the check out, so I asked to smell it and it smelled great, so it was a complete impulse buy, and</li>
      <li>It is great for my son&#x27;s morning bed head as his hair is growing out and calms my frizzy, naturally wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>I often do a \\&quot;wash-n-go\\&quot; (due to lack of time), and Hawaiian Silky is awesome with keeping my hair hydrated and my curls defined.</li>
      <li>I use it with a strong hold gel from Elasta QP.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very light and fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>By far the best moisturizer I have come across since going natural 2 yrs ago.</li>
      <li>and it was shiny and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair smooth.</li>
      <li>I have tried Aveda smooth straightening products, Redken antisnap, Nexxus emergency serum</li>
      <li>It works best for us to put a few pumps on the palm of our hand, add some water, rub our palms together and spread through the problem hair areas.  </li>
      <li>This is light moisture and seals the ends, which she needs since she can&#x27;t sleep with a hair scarf on yet.</li>
      <li>So far so good, and got it at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for my own hair, but once my husband tried it on our twin boys&#x27; and his own hair, I have to buy enough for four.  </li>
      <li>My hair is great and I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair to look</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My hair stylist turned me on to this product.  I use just a small amount on my long, thick hair.  It does just what it promises.  It provides very nice conditioning without being greasy or weighing hair down.  It enhances curls and adds body to hair. It also adds shine and soothes my itchy scalp.  I would happily pay twice the price for it.</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair. I&#x27;m Hispanic and I&#x27;d works good. My hair is so soft and since I dye my hair is get dried out really fast on the ends. This product has made my ends soft again and had repaired the dried ends.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty impressive and delivers on what it claims to do. I have rather curly hair and I bleached and dyed half of my head and had this recommended to me by a friend. It smells wonderful and moisturizes my hair without making it look greasy. However, this is not good for straight out of the shower if you have curly hair. But it&#x27;s wonderful for taking care of natural frizz a few hours after your shower. For holding my curls right out of the shower, I use Israeli hair products; they know how to handle curly hair.</li>
    <li> I used this to try to style my curls and straighten them but it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me. Now this does not mean this is a bad product, which is why I didn&#x27;t rate it with one star; this could be a great product for someone else who may have a softer texture, whereas I have 4a/4b/4c type texture.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, I like it.</li>
    <li> I have really soft tight curly hair and this product made my hair crunchy and hard. Also, my head kept itching! I agree with the others who reated this one star, this product is misleading. It seems like it works when you first spray it but when it dries up, your hair feels brittle and weak. Don&#x27;t waist your time.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair with the occasional relaxer. After a period of time there has been an over processed dry part of my hair come up and i was searching for an everyday moisturizer that can help the actual feeling of the hair. After trying Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, Pantene, and some other type of silk stuff that just left my hair greasy, I stumbled upon a blog about this product. After the first week of putting this and coconut milk anti breakage serum alone my edges, my hair is extremely soft and I can tell the results dramatically! If it doesn&#x27;t work for your hair then I&#x27;m sorry, please don&#x27;t down this product because I have seen many more positive reviews than negative. All in all .. GREAT PRODUCT WITH NOTICEABLE RESULTS!!</li>
    <li> By far the best moisturizer I have come across since going natural 2 yrs ago. No more ordering all that extra organic stuff, this here is what my hair loves. I love the fact I don&#x27;t even have to use it every day and my curls and waves are still popping (4a hair). I also spray it on my daughter&#x27;s hair to keep it moist while they wear braids.</li>
    <li> I am using the Hawaiian Silky 14-1 Miracleworker on my natural hair.  This product keeps my hair moisturized without feeling greasy and oily.  You can see the definition of my curls better.  Great product for the value and is available at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
    <li> Its a good product.  I used it for a while and switched to something else but I definitely would recommend it to those with thick hair not fine.</li>
    <li> I found this in a beauty supply store by accident. At the time I was growing out my perm a little so my roots were a bit curly and thick. It make my hair very soft and manageable and defined the curls in my hair. Now that my hair has been relaxed again it still makes it feel soft without that greasy heavy feeling.</li>
    <li> Good price, smells amazing, and leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I did the big chop in Sept 2011.  Initially, my natural hair was dry and dull. When I had relaxed hair Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products worked for me. My natural hair said NO!  I tried products my sister who has been natural for 10 years recommended, but I still had dry, crunchy hair.  A girlfriend suggested a product and swore by it.  I went to the beauty supply asking for it and I was handed Hawaiian Silky instead.  I was a little apprehensive, but I took it anyway.  I was shocked!  My hair has NEVER been soft or silky!  It worked and my curls are defined.  I&#x27;ve gotten my son and 2 of my daughters hooked on it.  Luv, luv, luv it!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best leave-in conditioners I have ever used and I have used A LOT! It does not leave residue so it is something you can use EVERYDAY! and it does not leave my hair greasy or sticky so I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product i already bought 3 more bottles :)</li>
    <li> I have never written a rating....but I had to when it came to finding a great product for my daughter. After trying Carroll&#x27;s Daughter, Shea Moister, and other pricey items...my daughters hair started to break and feel very coarse. I used this product and for lack of a better term... (Bow Bow)...My daughter&#x27;s hair is on the road to recovery. It feels and looks great all day! I posted how her hair looked before and after 12 hours at school and being a toddler!</li>
    <li> great product! detangles very well, non greasy, conditioner like product! the best part is it&#x27;s leave in!  takes out the ouch in the tender head kiddo :)</li>
    <li> why would anyone put mineral oil or lanolin in their hair? The product claims to moisturize hair, strengthen etc... It is not possible with the cheep and harmful products used. I hate the way it makes my hair feel, I have so much product buildup only baking soda or apple cider vinegar can remove. Nope, I wont be buying again. I was mislead by its rating. If you have natural hair, perm free or curly hair dont use this. it dries your hair and does not hydrate because the mineral oil coats the hair strand and keeps moisture from being absorbed. It weighs hair down so my curls cant pop. It doesnt even smell nice. Waste of money all around.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a everyday moisterizer for the hair without the wet sticky feel.  This hair spray is a wonderful product, it&#x27;s a light weight airy spray that leaves the hair soft moist and smelling great!!  I love this stuff I use it everyday for myself and the whole family!!!  You just spray shake and go!!</li>
    <li> This is the second moisturizer i use and i love it.A little bit goes a long way. My curls just pop like popcorn.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. I&#x27;m caucasian, with dry premature gray brittle hair. The employee highly recommended this product, so I tried it. I absolutely love it, and have recommended it to my friends. It&#x27;s very thick and creamy, so I spray it into my hands first, rub my hands together, then run my hands through my hair. I brush it through thoroughly. It&#x27;s really softened and moisturized my hair without making it oily at all. Highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Product was late arriving and the package was broken open, but the  Hawaiian Silky Miracle Worker 14 in 1, 16 oz works great on my hair for fly aways smoths it out. Never oil or greasy.</li>
    <li> I will make this short and sweet, I am an AA, I have 3c-4a hair type.  I started using this product 3 months ago.  A forest fire (the flat iron) destroyed most of my hair, (well the flat iron did have some help), and I had to get it chopped off  :/.  Sooo I decided to take care of my hair since this was the second deforestation since 2000.  That being said, in October I started using this product. Se magnifique!!!!!  This stuff is the miracle worker for the nappy bush.  My hair is soft, stays moisturized and it helps my curls&#x27;, look curly.  I recommended it to my mother who is a 4b-c and, she loves it too.  I think if you have thinner hair you will love it even more.  My mother and I have thick hair and this stuff is magic!! Hope this helps.  The down fall they don&#x27;t sell a bigger size.  It will last a thick hair type, a couple weeks to a month if you use it daily!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hawaiian Silky for 3 years and I seriously live by it. No other product will get my hair soft and last. I even use it on my 11 month old&#x27;s hair daily and it doesn&#x27;t dry her hair out and defines her curl pattern.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the products to take care of my damage hair so I went to Sally&#x27;s and I told the girl who was working there to recommend me something and she showed me this amazing product, I been using it for 2 months and it is great!!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair type:&lt;br /&gt;Natural African American&lt;br /&gt;3C  and 4A type curls (they look like the tiny springs in retractable pens)&lt;br /&gt;Fine strands,&lt;br /&gt;high density&lt;br /&gt;Coarse at the crown&lt;br /&gt;Low porosity (it takes at least 15 minutes for water to saturate my hair in the shower, and that was BEFORE I started using this product)&lt;br /&gt;Years Natural: 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;lightweight and non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;easy to distribute&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive (at Sally&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;requires little to be effective&lt;br /&gt;absorbs easily and relatively quickly&lt;br /&gt;Immediate results: my hair was softer and more moisturized the first time I used it, and it remained moisturized and soft without reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I have to reapply product every day or even twice a day to just barely keep my hair pliable. I Applied this product 1 time, while my hair was wet (after a wash) and it lasted for almost 6 days. On the 6th day, my crown (The Struggle) became a little less soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for 3 months now, with no adverse effects at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave residue - when used alone. I don&#x27;t use any other products with this anymore. The first time I put it on, I used it with Hair Chemist Coconut Leave-in conditioner and there were no flakes, and it still softened my hair better than the other product alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is ridiculous. At Sally&#x27;s this is $6.99 (USD), and at Black Owned Beauty Stores, It&#x27;s no more than $9.99 depending on the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients - SOME people flip out when they see lanolin and mineral oil. Those are two of the ingredients in this product, two among many other &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; ingredients. This is my take: My priority is not to avoid certain ingredients, my priority is to keep my hair moisturized and soft, have as little manipulation as possible, and have a product that is easy to use. If these are your priorities, this product is worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to mention: A lot of people skip the process of testing a product on a strand of hair BEFORE applying it to all of their hair.

    <li> You know, I never give reviews but I&#x27;ve used Hawaiian Silky 14 in 1 for several months by the suggestion of Sally&#x27;s saleswoman and it deserves an A+. I have tried Aveda smooth straightening products, Redken antisnap, Nexxus emergency serum and I just keep coming back to this product. It&#x27;s a good bargain and goes pretty far.</li>
    <li> I have to use this product sparingly because it has a tendency to dry my hair out.  When I use it with other products, such as leave-in-conditioners, it leaves residue on my hair, which starts flaking and then it looks like I have dandruff when I don&#x27;t.  I wanted to like this product, but it&#x27;s just okay for me.</li>
    <li> when my hair needs deep moisture without the oil I use this product it also help with my hair after shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale and thought I was throwing my money down the drain as I have on so many other products that claim to do things that they don&#x27;t. Butthis stuff is great.  I washed my hair and put it on afterwards and didn&#x27;t have time to dry my hair and the next day I looked at my hair and it was shiny and smooth.  My hair is normally somewhat curly and frizzy.  It was not frizzy at all.  Try it out.  This one is a keeper and not a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I got this a fee mouths ago I cut my hair because I was rocking the natural look it did make my hair feel soft yet sticky its an ok product it dose what it say it will do</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink, but also doesn&#x27;t smell that great. But I like the way it moisturizes and bring life to my curls, even with my hair twisted. I haven&#x27;t noticed any residual with daily use and a little goes a long way when my hair is twisted. I have shoulder length natural hair. Isn&#x27;t greasy. But may be cheaper in-store. Overall a satisfied purchase.</li>
    <li> Last year we adopted a little girl from Uganda.  We live in New Mexico so it is really dry here and not great for African-American hair.  This stuff has worked so well.</li>
    <li> I am using this on my relaxed hair and it really does wonders as a daily moisturizer.  My hair is soft, shiny and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weighed down.  I like to use it at night before I roll my hair at night.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have mixed hair. It&#x27;s kinky, wavy and straight and very coarse 4c in the back of my head...lots of different textures going on. And it&#x27;s very thick and to the middle of my back. It&#x27;s like Chaka Khan. I was ill for awhile and kept my hair in a pony tail. I didn&#x27;t comb it or anything in about a month and the more I laid on it, the worse it got. My hair was &amp;#34;matted&amp;#34; and it was pretty bad. I couldn&#x27;t feel my scalp, it was like a gigantic birds nest. Thought I&#x27;d never be able to comb through it. I ended up at Sallys beauty supply and after the rep tested the consistency of several products..one of which was Silken Child. She said that this product was the most moisturizing and had the best slip. I purchased it and proceeded to tackle this birds nest on my head.  I couldn&#x27;t even section my hair it was all stuck together. So I sprayed it with water and massaged a whole bunch of this product through my hair....let it set for a few minutes and began to tackle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dry brittle hair of mine.....plumped up and felt soft to the touch....I was able to comb &amp; brush through the clumped mess and  my hair started to untangle. It took LOTS of patience, but this product worked beautifully and I was shocked I lost minimal hairs in the process. Believe me when I say, my matted hair was so bad I feared I&#x27;d have to cut it off....and all of the growth I worked so hard to achieve.  THIS STUFF SAVED MY HAIR!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like it as leave-in....feels a little sticky to me.....but maybe I used too much.  As a detangler, it&#x27;s perfect!! The product has a nice consistency, is white in color like a cream...but not heavy whatsoever and not greasy.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a scent...it&#x27;s very light and fresh smelling. Tends to disappear, so not overpowering at all.  I&#x27;m natural and have been since 2009. I paid about $6 for it and that&#x27;s a heck of a deal! Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She it&#x27;s biracial and I have spent a lot of money on different well known brands like &#x27;mixed chicks&#x27; and &#x27;carol&#x27;s daughter&#x27; and others. But no other product has done so much for her thick curly hair.  I use it to detangle and also to moisturize her hair.  Best product.</li>
    <li> This is a very great product for natural black hair. This product has made my hair soft and manageable. However, it did not define my curls. I still like this product a great deal.</li>
    <li> It has a great tropical scent, so it reminds me of upcoming warmer weather. I don&#x27;t spray it directly on though, as it&#x27;s not a fine mist. So I spray it into my hands, rub into my hands and apply it on my hair. I have only used this less then a week, and I use it mid-shaft to ends. I love it. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my scalp to ends yet to know if it would be ok, but I tend to not put anything on my scalp other then washing it. So far so good, and got it at Sally&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t remember the price, but I&#x27;m not buying something online that I can pick up in the store cheaper and not have to buy over $25 worth of stuff for free shipping. I do shop on Amazon for things I can&#x27;t get in the stores, but this product was something I saw at Sally&#x27;s at the check out, so I asked to smell it and it smelled great, so it was a complete impulse buy, and well worth it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s a spray, but not a fine mist, so when I first sprayed it on my hair, I hated it, it was like spraying lotion on my hair and had to wash it out. So spray in my hands, no problem distributing it.</li>
    <li> Great for the whole family!!!!  It miraculously changes our bad hair days to good hair days. It works best for us to put a few pumps on the palm of our hand, add some water, rub our palms together and spread through the problem hair areas.  It is great for my son&#x27;s morning bed head as his hair is growing out and calms my frizzy, naturally wavy hair.  We use it more to.fix our hair after it is already dry.</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully on my very curly, very frizzy hair.  It keeps the curls but NO FRIZZ!  Much less expensive than the Biosilk Therapy I&#x27;ve been using for decades.  And it has a pleasant fragrance, different from the Biosilk, but still very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Another good product for texturised hair.</li>
    <li> This can leave your curls soft to the touch after you wash your hair.  I think it is good for curls that needs that extra boost to moisturize the hair.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my Grandmother. I didn&#x27;t really give much thought to try until I ran out of some other stuff that I was using at that time. I fell in love one the first use, and that was with chemically treated hair. My hair is natural now (and untreated with color) and in my opinion, it&#x27;s works even better. It keeps my hair moisturized and soft and it&#x27;s very light weight so I never lose any volume in my hair. My hair never looks greasy or oily, just healthy and happy. If you&#x27;re a natural, I highly recommend this product. I love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable. I had very course hair and now it is as soft as ever! It has strengthened my hair so much and I love it!</li>
    <li> I tried this product on my natural, curly hair.  I have VERY curly, unruly hair. I would describe my curls as pencil curls, bc they are about the diameter of a pencil.  Anyway, I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to help tame my often wild curls.  They get dry very quickly (and &#x27;shrink&#x27; or tighten throughout the day), when I wear my curls loose.  This product really helps keep them moisturized.  I use it with a strong hold gel from Elasta QP.  These products work very well together. Hawaiian Silky even helps keep my hair slick when I wear it in a bun!  I slick my hair into a ponytail, and twist it into a bun.  Usually, the gel makes my hair crispy.  With Hawaiian Silky, my hair stays soft to the touch, without leaving residue on my fingers!  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical about hair products as there are so many on the market, I have looked far and wide for a product to help with my dry ends, I live in Utah and the dryness is awful on my hair.  I&#x27;ve used the product for a week and love it!  I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;soy based&amp;#34; products that do absolutely nothing for me.  I only use this product on my ends.  I will be ordering another bottle and already recommended it to my daughter.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this product and decided to buy it. It&#x27;s a wonderful product!!!! It leaves my hair shiny and soft without being greasy, sticky, or oily. (I have 3b/3c hair)...excellent product for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair type is curly. I&#x27;m irish so nothing really major going on with my hair. I do however smoke. Smoking damages your hair really badly and this has helped my hair alot. I really do love this product. It leaves my hair so soft and healthy looking and feeling. I have tried alot of different products and this one seems to be the best, I would recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> I found this at my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply on sale for $4.99, so I decided to try it. Wow!!!! I love it! I works so well on my natural hair( I&#x27;m African-American). It is a wonderful moisturizer, and it smells lovely!  This is now a staple in my hair regiment !</li>
    <li> I must admit that I have added this product to my must-haves. It does add moisture to your hair, it has a very pleasant aroma and the price is just right for me, since I do not like to pay a lot of money for hair care products.  I do think that it would be better for those who have gone natural; I have relaxed hair right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use it to tame my edges when putting my hair into a ponytail.  The only draw back that I have noticed is that once used on my dry hair for ponytails, I must wash it out before I decide to curl my hair.  If I do not do this, then my hair will not curl at all when using any hot styling tools. However the instructions does say that if you have relaxed hair, to use while hair is wet.  That is the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> This product ruined my hair pattern after three days of use by frizzing up my coils. The smell is also pretty pungent. My hair was soft though...</li>
    <li> This product from the first use was like wow. My natural hair just became so soft, easy to comb and it showed the long length of my hair which makes me love it. My hair is great and I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair to look it&#x27;s best.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how much it helped to alleviate the frizziness in my natural curly hair.  I also tried it on my sons very fine straight fly away hair.  It helped smooth it down and made his hair incredibly shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my own hair, but once my husband tried it on our twin boys&#x27; and his own hair, I have to buy enough for four.  It leaves the hair shoft, shiny and manageable without being messy or sticky.  If I were back in the States, I would purchase at the local beauty supply for less than $5 per 16oz bottle.  I pay more at Amazon, but we like this product so much, I will pay the extra cost.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Great product. Fantastic. Happy with it. Makes my hair smooth. Good job. I dont like having to write this much for a review.</li>
    <li> I used this product earlier in the day, and later on I decided to flat iron my hair. My flat iron was on the usual temp that I put it on with straightening my hair, but I noticed a burning hair smell. Since the bottle said thermal protection I went against my first mind, and I continued straightening my hair. When I got finished, my hair was hard, dry, and worse of all HEAT DAMAGED. My hair is naturally soft and curly when it&#x27;s wet and now it&#x27;s dry, hard and FRIZZY! I want to sew this dumb a** company for false advertisement! I worked hard growing my hair and now I have to chop it off!!!!!!! &amp;#62;:(</li>
    <li> Great product. Moisturizes your hair without being greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m AA and use this for daily maintenance and as a leave-in conditioner.  I also add African Pride oil for added moisture.&lt;br /&gt;My hair stays nicely conditioned &amp; shiny without a dry, crispy look that is so hard to rid of.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Just a warning this stuff smells really funky in a bad way. And I don&#x27;t see how it helps my hair at all ): not worth the price</li>
    <li> Finally a product that holds the moisture in my biracial daughters hair.</li>
    <li> This has helped my daughter and I with our dry, brittle hair.  It is not greasy at all, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> It is gentle on your hair and leaves it soft and manageable.  The jury is still out whether or not it promotes hair growth.</li>
    <li> For a very long time I thought Hawaiian Silky products were for women who were mixed or of Hawaiian race, boy was I wrong.  This product was recommended to me by a worker at Sallyʻs Beauty Supply and I must say it has been the best product I have purchased.  When I was staying in a hotel a few weeks ago I had to use the hotel shampoo (we all know that this shampoo isnʻt generally the kind for African American hair), I used this product along with the shampoo and my hair was so smooth and soft.  I would recommend this product for those of you who have damaged hair (or donʻt sleep with a scarf on her head). Wonderful product!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> does what it claims to do</li>
    <li> There is a special kind of feeling you get when you buy a product you&#x27;ve never tried before and it ACTUALLY WORKS! The first bottle I bought I used the entire thing and was still trying to salvage some out of the bottle (lol!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a natural with a combination of 3C/4A/4B hair types. It can be very difficult to find products. One day, I saw Hawaiian Silky online and it had a lot of great reviews. I didn&#x27;t buy it that day. But another day, when I was meandering through the local beauty supply store, I saw it on the shelf and decided to get it (plus the great price made the decision easier). I tried it the next morning. First impression: it smells SOOOO good! Second impression: it softens and hydrates my hair beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it everyday for various styles. I often do a \\&quot;wash-n-go\\&quot; (due to lack of time), and Hawaiian Silky is awesome with keeping my hair hydrated and my curls defined. Hawaiian Silky works great with updos and, surprisingly, with pressed-out styles too (of course, you have to use WAYYY less, like a pea-sized dollop).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m such a huge fan of this. If you&#x27;re having any doubts on whether or not to purchase it, JUST GET IT!. IT WORKS! Worst case scenario is that it won&#x27;t work for you and all you&#x27;ll lose is five measly dollars. *shrug* Try it and love it.</li>
    <li> This was the first hair spray that I bought after my BC and it was the worst product that I could have had.  It did not moisturize my hair at all.  It left a sticky mess on the top of my head and it was too thick to get to my roots, leaving my hair wet on top and bone dry on the bottom.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after trying a few other things on my toddlers hair. She has very thick hair and it has coils the diameter of a pencil. This made her twist soft, manageable and no longer dry. I use it daily and this has been the only thing that worked. I tried carols daugther, but the fragrance in the spring time has the bees swarming and she got stung, it is also to heavy. This is light moisture and seals the ends, which she needs since she can&#x27;t sleep with a hair scarf on yet. Sallys recommended it and the sales associate promise it would work, I was skeptical because I have tried other products and must say, I noticed a dramatic difference in her hair. No more hair drama or emotions.</li>
    <li> i was recommended to use this by a fellow naturalist at store. i love this product ,it does wonders on natural hair ,colored,or relaxed hair. my hair is very soft ,well moisturized,and curls are defined.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Sally&#x27;s Beauty just two days ago. I put it on my hair as I flat-twisted it. My hair was soft. Very soft. It&#x27;s consistency is a little thin and it&#x27;s a clear color like a serum. My hair is really thick and it works wonders for me. I&#x27;ve been natural for 2.5 years and this is the first product to do this for me. It&#x27;s not greasy, oily or anything. Honestly, my twist outs have been staying moisturized all day-- And right now the temperature is in the 40s and 50s where I live. Definitely try this.</li>
    <li> My natural hair stylist recommended this product and she was dead on. It helps my hair hold moisture all day.</li>
    <li> I hhave relaxed hair. It makes my hair soft temporarily, then my hair dries out after a few hours and I have to reapply, usually three times a day. I started applying it, waiting about 15min and then applying an oil moisterizer (kept my hair soft most of the day) I don&#x27;t like how the spray comes out in a clumpy splooge not even really a spray, I began pouring it out of the bottle into my hand and working it through my hair. I&#x27;ve always prefered mists or finer sprays. The seller shipped it quickly with no issues</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes.  It did moisturize at first then it felt gummy and sticky.  I am totally natural and thought it would help.  My hair had grown quite a bit and I wanted to flat iron it to see the true length...it was like I had a relaxer!  My hair would not \\&quot;draw up\\&quot;, \\&quot;shrink\\&quot; or anything. I had to cut off what did not break off. My bi-racial daughter used it as well and we have completely different hair types.  My daughter is between a 3a and 3b.  I am around 4b or 4c.  It changed her texture as well.  She flat irons regularly and we knew something was different but did not realize it was the Hawaiian Silky until I flat ironed my hair.  I will NEVER use this again, nor recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my show Havanese - it keeps the tangles away and keeps hair silky &amp; moisturized - smells great - I always use before blow drying dogs coat</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not rating the product because that&#x27;s not who is selling it .fast shipping .i see price went up after I bought it .great product too for curl definition and twist outs and all those styles</li>
    <li> I use this product on my daughters hair whose is really curly. I can put it in while her hair is dry and its amazing the way it works while its dry, it detangles it moisturizes easy to use, smells nice... I would recommend it to anyone who has that coares curly hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders for my childs hair.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, somewhat curly hair that likes to frizz a little.  This helps reduce the frizz.  I noticed an immediate difference when I started using it.  Will definitely continue to buy!</li>
