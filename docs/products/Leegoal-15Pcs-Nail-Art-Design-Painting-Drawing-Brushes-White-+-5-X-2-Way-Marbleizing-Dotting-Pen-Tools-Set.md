    <li> I bought it for my daughter and she love them.</li>
    <li> Great for for beginners or professionals.  Easy to use for basic or complicated designs. Easy storage. Great with acrylic nail paint. HAVE FUN, BE CUTE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Item was shipped in a timely manner and they were good quality for the price . The dotting tools worked great only used one out of all the brushes and it worked well no problems I will recommend this item ..</li>
    <li> Came early look just like picture,  happy it the items.</li>
    <li> This actually arrived before it was expected so that was nice.  What you see is what you get.  I have not used them yet but they look simple and easy to use.  I cant wait to try them out.  The price was right.</li>
    <li> They arrived on time and in good shape. These brushes are very user friendly and hold up great. If you do a lot of art work you get your money from them.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, nothing missing or damaged.  Ok so I bought a set of these for me a while back 6-8 months ago, I liked so much I ordered 2 more as gifts for others.  Everyone loves this set,  very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I love using these tools, they are great.</li>
    <li> These brushes look just as they do in the pics but they are not as sturdy as I had hoped. It&#x27;s not that good to do designs with.</li>
    <li> Item just as described.  I&#x27;m very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Great tools.  I gave it a 4 because the tips all fell off when cleaning and I had to glue them back on.</li>
    <li> Nothing to say. It&#x27;s very good</li>
    <li> Great tools for nail art! Great price and customer service !</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter as a gift, she love it and have been using it ever since.  Goods arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> The glue holding the metal prices in place sucked but other than that they work awesomely.</li>
    <li> Great to order if you have time to wait, long shipping time frames.  Very inexpensive and quality is pretty low but serves it&#x27;s purpose.  One brush fell off of the wood.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set and waited close to a month for them. They arrived just when I thought they would, and I was excited to try them out. The dotting tools are just fine, although many of them are really close, if not the same, size. Plus it lacks any larger sized dotting tools. Then the brushes themselves were not that great. One of them was too tall for the package, and is bent out of shape because of it. Not to mention that all of the brushes are stiff and leave streaks when you use them. This is fine if you are looking for something cheap, but don&#x27;t expect great quality.</li>
    <li> I can make so many new styles and even the ones I could do before just look better now thanks to the brushes and/or dotting pens. If anyone is looking for ideas on how to best use these or just want some new design ideas just look at youtube, find all kinds of cute ideas.</li>
    <li> These came on time and were packaged nicely &#x3D;)  I love to do different nail designs and these are perfect for me</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, super soft my mom is really happy cos now she can do some nice designs with her friends ;)</li>
    <li> well that brushes had a good price, but some of them are like not a good quality, and about tha dotting pen there are perfect...&lt;br /&gt;but it is a excellent option because the price!</li>
    <li> dotting tools are great but the brushes are a little cheaply made. they do work very well and that is good but dont get acetone on the handle it will melt the paint off.</li>
    <li> Great service. Product as described!</li>
    <li> These brushes are going to get some great use. Package came a lot earlier than expected and in great condition. Pretty good quality I love all the different brushes really good purchase.</li>
    <li> Great set, met my expectations and got to me faster than expected! Thank you, will do business with again!</li>
    <li> Received package before expected. It came safely wrapped. I love the entire set. Only gave it 4 stars because the brushes had sperated from handle, however some glue will do the trick &amp; be as good as new.</li>
    <li> As a mom of 4 girls and one grand daughter we go through lots of nail polish, and we love to try new designs but found it really hard to make them without the right tools.

    <li> Super fast shipping. Beautiful product.</li>
    <li> 1. It was late!&lt;br /&gt;2. One tool was broken when I finally recurve my package.&lt;br /&gt;3. The brushes are way too hard they aren&#x27;t, usesable, or straight, with lots of strays&lt;br /&gt;4. Three of my do trees broken when I was cleaning them&lt;br /&gt;Horrible for beginners, like myself</li>
    <li> Dotting tools work great. The brushes are cheap material and break apart... You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Slow shipping but good quality product</li>
    <li> The Brushes Were Damaged And Waited 3 Months For Shipping. 👎</li>
    <li> I love my new nail art brushes</li>
