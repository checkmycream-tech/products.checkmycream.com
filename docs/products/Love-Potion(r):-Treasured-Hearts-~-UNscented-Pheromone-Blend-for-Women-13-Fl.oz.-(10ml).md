      <li>I first tried this phero blend in a wax melt (btw, lovepotionperfume offers the best smelling wax melts, you should really try them, I think you can find them on their website).</li>
      <li>It helps me stay calm and happy...and it helps with bonding!</li>
      <li>It smoothes ruffled feathers....very good for things such as family reunions where tensions can often run amok.</li>
      <li>This is one of my most recent purchases from Love Potion.</li>
      <li>and, as it turned out that I saw them more than once, I made sure to wear the same phero each time, for consistency.  </li>
      <li>since have used it in more positive social surroundings too with lovely results...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn Treasured Hearts around my friends and family to great effect, and I&#x27;ve even worn it to work on a few occasions.</li>
      <li>It always seems to set the stage for a relaxed and calm environment.  </li>
      <li>This not only is calming for me, but it seems to put those around me at ease, creating a warm snuggly vibe.  </li>
      <li>I layered it over a nice subtle scent, and trudged bravely onward towards a much dreaded family gathering (where I was completely outnumbered 5 to 1).  </li>
      <li>Yes, it is a pheromone, but this is a SOCIAL pheromone mostly.</li>
      <li>This one works really well to improve my own confidence and also build rapport with strangers, sometimes you want the another person to have a deep and positive impression of you.</li>
      <li>I definitely noticed a much more chipper feeling in myself and for the women that I  talked to, easy-going more open conversations.</li>
      <li>However it does it, it is a BIG winner in many scenarios.</li>
      <li>Formulated to create a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere between those you are interacting with..&lt;br /&gt;I tried this phero on and off for two weeks.</li>
      <li>The way to use it is very simple: just spray this all over the body without clothes on, or even on top of your hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but  where some situations and people are concerned, it can come pretty close.</li>
      <li>She will order some for herself in future, and is so pleased that the samples, that came with it.</li>
      <li>This was the second pheromone from Love Potion ( LP) that I purchased.</li>
      <li>subtle, yet excellent for social occasions.</li>
      <li>I was fine through the entire 3 hour gathering and arrived home unscathed.</li>
      <li>It really smooths out my mood and helps me to get along with people who might make me irritable.</li>
      <li>I use this phero when I want others to be extra caring and attentive to me.  </li>
      <li>Got this for a a gift and now she says s really likes it with the kitten slipers, because it gives her a comforting feeling when traveling  for her work.  </li>
      <li>No interactions with bristly ladies, but my guy coworkers were flustered around me when describing coding logic that they normally could recite in their sleep!  </li>
      <li>As I recalled our conversation later that evening, I recognized the more cooperative attitude and additionally a desire for the other individual to hang around me for a while, chat more in general and be somewhat more positive and agreeable after we finished our \\&quot;business\\&quot; and moved on to other topics.</li>
      <li>The effect was really intriguing - especially considering that just 7 feet away from me</li>
      <li>go much differently, more smoothly and cooperative on the part of the other person,  much more so than previous recent discussions on the subject.</li>
      <li>I Love this company and have been addicted since the first time.</li>
      <li>So much so that I have ordered a back up bottle as I never want to be without.</li>
      <li>WOW</li>
      <li>It really seems to assist in calming anxiety,and helping others open up.</li>
      <li>I have had a few deep and meaningful conversations while wearing this.  </li>
      <li>Days later , pretty close to the same situation and result</li>
      <li>Most recently I&#x27;ve worn it to doctor&#x27;s appointments, when I was anxious and didn&#x27;t want to get rushed out of the office in 2 minutes.  </li>
      <li>But overall I definitely see friendliness in the new job that I have.</li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s the go to for family situations and at times when I have to be social but also connect at a deeper level.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product on and off, whenever I am going to a social / romantic meeting with someone new, this is the LP I use with other scented LP perfumes.</li>
      <li>I must say, everyone (those around me, anyway) was noticably calmer and less confrontational (which is a normal occurence with this group) and moods were just lighter in general.  </li>

    <li> If pheromones are your game than you will consider Treasured Hearts an essential addition to your kit. I&#x27;ve used TH for dealing with unpleasant people for years &amp; it does the trick! YMMV of course, but I recommend Treasured Hearts to anybody that has to deal with difficult/obnoxious people in their lives.</li>
    <li> I am SO happy that I bought this one and added it to my collection. What an awesome help it can be when you need a little help making things go more smoothly with people! It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but  where some situations and people are concerned, it can come pretty close. It seems to exude an effect where people just seem more mellow, friendly, more sociable, chatty. Yes, it is a pheromone, but this is a SOCIAL pheromone mostly. My experience has shown that it can make things go much more smoothly on the home front as well. And when it comes to self effects, this one has helped me immensely even when it comes to being on the phone with difficult people. I suppose it effects me and then they in turn, simply mirror what I am putting out. However it does it, it is a BIG winner in many scenarios. A truly beautiful blend.</li>
    <li> This blends bring the wearer lots of cuddly, caring attention. You really will feel treasured and it is great for heart-to-heart connections and conversations. Makes people attentive.</li>
    <li> I first tried this phero blend in a wax melt (btw, lovepotionperfume offers the best smelling wax melts, you should really try them, I think you can find them on their website). I wanted to try how it will work in a situation like family gatherings, when whether you want it or not, atmosphere sometimes becomes tense, stressful and well, crazy ;) Treasured hearts made absolutely everyone nice and put them in a good mood, no fighting, arguing...everyone was cheerful! I love it!</li>
    <li> I Love this company and have been addicted since the first time.I added this oil to my other one I had bought from them and felt it added the extra zing.Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Treasured Hearts was recommended to me as a \\&quot;booster\\&quot; for an upcoming visit from the in-laws.  I layered it over a nice subtle scent, and trudged bravely onward towards a much dreaded family gathering (where I was completely outnumbered 5 to 1).  I must say, everyone (those around me, anyway) was noticably calmer and less confrontational (which is a normal occurence with this group) and moods were just lighter in general.  The effect was really intriguing - especially considering that just 7 feet away from me I witnessed the usual familial discord going on (but I resisted the temptation to insert myself into THAT group to see if Treasured Hearts could help out.)  I was fine through the entire 3 hour gathering and arrived home unscathed. That in and of itself was nothing short of miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I since have used it in more positive social surroundings too with lovely results... just a nice \\&quot;feel good\\&quot; vibe.  I don&#x27;t know how the pheromone-magik actually happens, but there is a LOT of evidence for me now that there is indeed something to this science!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely phero, great for bonding and gives me warm fuzzies. It really smooths out my mood and helps me to get along with people who might make me irritable. This is a must have in any phero arsenal.</li>
    <li> I love having an unscented version of this pheromone blend so that I can pair it with all my favorite Love potion scents. Treasured Hearts gives me a light and easy going feeling and usually helps the people around me relax and have a wonderful time. Definite must have for anyone hoping to create a soothing, comforting environment, while having versatility to use this with a variety of perfumes.</li>
    <li> I wore this to work today and out to lunch.  No interactions with bristly ladies, but my guy coworkers were flustered around me when describing coding logic that they normally could recite in their sleep!  I definitely noticed a much more chipper feeling in myself and for the women that I  talked to, easy-going more open conversations.</li>
    <li> I like to wear this when I know I&#x27;ll be around family or around prickly females.  This not only is calming for me, but it seems to put those around me at ease, creating a warm snuggly vibe.  I have had a few deep and meaningful conversations while wearing this.  It seems to temper any defensiveness in a group.  There is no scent and it&#x27;s safe to spray in hair or on top of clothing.  Can be worn alone or with your favorite scent.  I find that I wear it more for me rather than those around me, but it affects both.</li>
    <li> This was the second pheromone from Love Potion ( LP) that I purchased. Formulated to create a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere between those you are interacting with..&lt;br /&gt;I tried this phero on and off for two weeks. I did notice two particular interactions with my teen (regarding final exams and grades, occasionally this can be a stress inducing subject) go much differently, more smoothly and cooperative on the part of the other person,  much more so than previous recent discussions on the subject. This is something that occurred to me after the fact. As I recalled our conversation later that evening, I recognized the more cooperative attitude and additionally a desire for the other individual to hang around me for a while, chat more in general and be somewhat more positive and agreeable after we finished our \\&quot;business\\&quot; and moved on to other topics. WOW&lt;br /&gt;That realization hit me like a ton of bricks.&lt;br /&gt;4 Days later , pretty close to the same situation and result but with two kids and another parent, one who tends to be a bit shy and business like in personal interactions. Those two experiences are known as \\&quot;hits\\&quot; ( reactions you notice in other people) in the language of Pheromones. They can be subtle or occasionally larger reactions but its usually something that you recognize after the fact. I tend to like the social Pheros, some also give off great \\&quot;Self Effects\\&quot; meaning they affect your mood in an uplifting manner. I get that often with a La Femme Mystere and a couple of others, you would have to visit the LP site to see all they offer.  I don&#x27;t get the self effects with this blend but it&#x27;s very popular and others do. What I get with Treasured Harts is a comfortable convivial atmosphere and good conversation.</li>
    <li> I use this phero when I want others to be extra caring and attentive to me.  Most recently I&#x27;ve worn it to doctor&#x27;s appointments, when I was anxious and didn&#x27;t want to get rushed out of the office in 2 minutes.  It worked!!  I feel like I have a much better connection with my doc, and, as it turned out that I saw them more than once, I made sure to wear the same phero each time, for consistency.  I also use this with the DH when I&#x27;m feeling sad or grumpy.  I get a nice self-effect, and he is more attentive...mood lifter for sure!!  Pheros add a subtle boost to the mood I need, and this is one that I will never let run out!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy Treasured Hearts for the way it helps with bonding.If I know I will be in a situation with someone who may be nervous or anxious,this is the one I go for. It really seems to assist in calming anxiety,and helping others open up.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It assists conversation and soothes emotions.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on and off, whenever I am going to a social / romantic meeting with someone new, this is the LP I use with other scented LP perfumes. This one works really well to improve my own confidence and also build rapport with strangers, sometimes you want the another person to have a deep and positive impression of you. The way to use it is very simple: just spray this all over the body without clothes on, or even on top of your hair.</li>
    <li> I call this the &amp;#34;Family Gathering&amp;#34; pheromone.  It always seems to set the stage for a relaxed and calm environment.  I love the bonding feeling with this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this pheromone. It helps me stay calm and happy...and it helps with bonding! I wear this around my family and friends a lot. It also helps with grumpy husbands! I also love that because this is unscented, you can wear this with any perfume, or even by itself!</li>
    <li> This is one of my most recent purchases from Love Potion. It&#x27;s a feel-good phero for women, and it works so well!  I&#x27;ve worn Treasured Hearts around my friends and family to great effect, and I&#x27;ve even worn it to work on a few occasions. Not only does it make the wearer feel happy and upbeat, it causes a mood lift in those around her, too. People around me seem relaxed and cheerful when I wear this blend. It&#x27;s a wonderful blend to use while out shopping, as people are friendlier and a wee bit more helpful. And who doesn&#x27;t love that?</li>
    <li> I wore this one at Thanksgiving with the in laws and it worked wonders. I am an introvert, and it made me more fun to be around, I was able to have conversations and feel comfortable in social situations, which is very surprising! Even my partner noticed a difference! You can wear this by itself without a cover, it is not stinky. For me, it&#x27;s the go to for family situations and at times when I have to be social but also connect at a deeper level.</li>
    <li> Got this for a a gift and now she says s really likes it with the kitten slipers, because it gives her a comforting feeling when traveling  for her work.  Also makes people easy to talk to, and seems to give a her confidence. She will order some for herself in future, and is so pleased that the samples, that came with it.</li>
    <li> I like to call this one &amp;#34;spread the love&amp;#34;!  It is not smelly, so it can be sprayed anywhere without having to worry about using a good cover scent.  It smoothes ruffled feathers....very good for things such as family reunions where tensions can often run amok.</li>
    <li> subtle, yet excellent for social occasions. I keep thinking maybe it&#x27;s working because I expect it to work for the price. But overall I definitely see friendliness in the new job that I have. Also, people take time to help me especially when asking them for directions. Placebo effect? I don&#x27;t think so..there is some kind of &amp;#34;treasure&amp;#34; in this one.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites!  Incredible for bonding and creating a peaceful happy vibe!  I use this in lots of different situations and find it wonderful.  So much so that I have ordered a back up bottle as I never want to be without.</li>
