      <li>I am getting ready to do my nails and add these to my designs!!</li>
      <li>And then get caught on everything and come off pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>These are very nice but really small.</li>

      <li>I bought this set and was very surprised with how quickly it came.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied hut main reason for buying was for the Chanel pieces</li>

      <li>Did not receive Chanel pieces and they are a lot smaller than expected which is good.</li>
      <li>I got the starburst, and butterflies and some gorgeous roses, umbrellas &amp; stars (not very happy with those).</li>
      <li>its really easy to apply on nails stays on for a very long time</li>
      <li>a good deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery didnt take as long as I expected</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE the designs and very cute. material is good not cheap. came with alot and on time to use very pleased</li>
    <li> Perfect for nail art. Package consisted of bows. Hello kitty outline. Snowflakes. Channel. Butterflies. Very cute. Must have on your nails.</li>
    <li> came in an extremely small Ziploc bag all jumbled up! got nowhere near 500, only got around 100. half were broken, most were rusted, and won&#x27;t fit only my nail. such a waste of money, glad I got my money back! do NOT get these!!</li>
    <li> Very cute, I love them. I wasn&#x27;t sure how big they were gunna be..so to help I included a picture to help others. Will order again, quick shipping.</li>
    <li> i am going to have great fun with these. very small and danty yet can see what they are. and lots i can do with these. and they came quicker than what they said.</li>
    <li> They are so cute and so pretty on the nails really cute almost running out might have to order some more</li>
    <li> Time to get creative with my new designs. This are some cute nail art. Saving money on my nails. :)</li>
    <li> These are nice if you do subtle. They are flimsy but for the price who can complain. I did some cute nails with these.</li>
    <li> In theory, it was really cute. I tried hard to really like this product but it failed miserably. The stickers are pretty hard but they don&#x27;t have a curve so when you stick one on your finger nail, the edges are off. My hair got caught in this metal sticker multiple times and I had to get rid of it after a day. I tried to bend the side but they&#x27;re so small you can&#x27;t bend them unless you have a special tool. Won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> Very cute love them i use them to embed in acrylic and they looked fantastic</li>
    <li> They are a bit smaller than I thought but it&#x27;s cool I used a couple to jazz up my twinn daughters nails they love it! So i am pleased and they are cute i might have to order some more.</li>
    <li> These are very nice but really small. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, so I don&#x27;t know how they will hold up or how easy they will be to put on.</li>
    <li> I just got one bag of butterflies and there were about 50 pcs!&lt;br /&gt;Not even close for 500 pcs.... wow!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. The pictures and descriptions are spot on. I would definitely recommend these to fellow nail art enthusiasts.</li>
    <li> Did not receive Chanel pieces and they are a lot smaller than expected which is good. I counted them and did receive 100 per design but was missing the Chanel design. So I got 400 in all. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied hut main reason for buying was for the Chanel pieces but these will do I guess</li>
    <li> I am very upset with what I receive the description says 500 pieces with about 5 different designs I received only one design winch is the hello kitty I didn&#x27;t get the Chanel sign, the bows the butterfly and whatever else is supposed to be included, I am very unhappy with this, I paid 2.99 and I did not get what I paid for this I very bad for business and it needs to be fixed, do not buy</li>
    <li> These are actually really good quality! They took a while to get here because of how far they came, but that is to be expected. I recommend, especially if you just want something fun and simple.</li>
    <li> I only got 100 and the description says 500!!!!! They look nice but I&#x27;m short 400 that&#x27;s a problem.... hello</li>
    <li> Got exactly what was pictured and the quality is great. They stuck on my nails for about a week :) However, some of the designs are a little big and will not lay flush with the nail (esp if your fingers are smaller). I just used tweezers to bend the design a little so it would fit the contour of my nail. Worked just fine!</li>
    <li> I am digging the snowflakes and the butterflies will get used up too I am sure, these are very easy to use and can be reused if you are careful</li>
    <li> these are made out of stiff, thickish metal. They don&#x27;t bend to the shape of the nail so when you put them on your nails they stay flat.  And then get caught on everything and come off pretty quickly. Don&#x27;t buy these for your nails..use them for art projects instead.</li>
    <li> The item shipped fast. The decals were larger than expected. I have not seen in any nail salon so its unique decals to have.</li>
    <li> They are very beautiful the only problem I have is that they are a little stiff. If you don&#x27;t want them scratching you or getting stuck in hair I recommend pressing them against a pen to round them up like the shape of your nails but everything mentioned came in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for any nails! I am getting ready to do my nails and add these to my designs!! I will for sure order more of these in the future!!</li>
    <li> They were beautiful and matched some others I ordered this is a great way to refill your stock it was easy to order and came in promptly.</li>
    <li> Soooo cute i got all the charms shown in the picture I got them on time and in a little wheel for storage. Love the product and im very happy</li>
    <li> I got about 550 yey! However, I didn&#x27;t get andy hello kitty, chanel, and bows, which is very upseting becuase those where the main reason I bought this product... I got the starburst, and butterflies and some gorgeous roses, umbrellas &amp; stars (not very happy with those). I like the quality of the product but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unless I was guaranteed to received the exact items pictured. Seller should be more specific in the description and let buyers know that they might not get what is shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> These r really cute but u have to know how to bend them to ur nail shape I guess it&#x27;s gonna take me a couple times to get use to it</li>
    <li> Disappointed only because I misread the description and did not realize it was 5 different styles. But it was mark 5 designs with 100 each. So this was my fault. I didn&#x27;t count them but is probably 100 of each. Snowflake,  hello kitty bow, butterflies and chanel.</li>
    <li> These are very tiny great size for the nail bendable with tool did not get 500 I counted took a while ended up getting 400 peices .</li>
    <li> I got this because there and how could you not want these! Mine had hello kitty, bows,snowflakes, DC symbol , and butterflies they are all together so you have to sort them which I don&#x27;t mind I threw the DC symbol out because I don&#x27;t like it they were perfect though nothing wrong with them.&lt;br /&gt;They go on your nails easily just put a top coat on!</li>
    <li> Cute. Not enough of some too many of others.</li>
    <li> I really like the product; however the channel symbol never came in the package. This is the reason I&#x27;m giving 3 stars. Not as was showing in the picture. Also, I didn’t like the fact that was metal, which makes hard to place in the nail. worth 2 stars only</li>
    <li> Bought for wife, she loves them. When you have beautiful hands this product just brings out more of it.</li>
    <li> Love these got all 500 pieces only thing you have to separate them yourself.....</li>
    <li> They are perfect for the job, thank you</li>
    <li> The company provided a free gift with purchase! The metal stickers need to be bent, but are as pictured. They provide two free gifts with purchase! Awesome prices and service. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Plz dont buy this product.the description is set as 500 when its not even 100. Its a total  rip off</li>
    <li> they didnt even fall off with glue or encapsulated</li>
    <li> This ad said 500 and it just had around 30 per 5 bag ... The decoration is very pretty thou and easy to encapsulate because of how thin they are.</li>
    <li> These came in, and my nail techs were so excited.  They look expensive, without being expensive, so we are able to add them to the nail menu without breaking anyone&#x27;s bank!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to bows and hello kittys... however I got butterflies, umbrellas, princess crowns, umbrellas and channell...  The ad said 500 pieces.. more like 5 bags of 30...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feeling a little misled...</li>
    <li> I received all 500 in Hello Kitty, Chanel, Snowflakes, butterflies, and bows everything as described</li>
    <li> Love them! They are soo cute! And I wanted a black bow for my nails so I tried to paint one to see what it would look like and it worked and looked perfect! I would definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> I got only 100 pics of hello kitty which was open and all over in the package  ..........MOST upsetting ...</li>
    <li> There really is probably 500 pieces in here I got hello kitty,  snowflake, butterflies, Channel, and bows. They are by far CT he most adorable nail decals :)</li>
    <li> It will work on acrylic tips at it&#x27;s drying state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it will not work on natural nails like some people stated here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s sharp too. So i wouldn&#x27;t just lay on top of the nail all sloppy. You might end up cutting your skin,</li>
    <li> I ordered these because my daughter loves for me to do her nails. She loves them and so do I. These stickers work well for children and adults. Awesome.</li>
    <li> although I didn&#x27;t get what it advertise, it is a nice product and I would buy it again</li>
    <li> None were damaged. But i didnt recieve the same pieces in the photo.</li>
    <li> I love this.product but I just wish they would package them separate because I now ave to one by one separate them and put them in there own package but other then that they are great. Really small aren&#x27;t to big</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and you can do so many things to make your nails beautiful and different.</li>
    <li> i apply these when the polish is still tacky and then add top coat right away.  they are eye catching.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the Chanel,but there was no Chanel.What a rip off. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.Not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> They are cute but unless I apply them with UV gel overlay they do not lay flat and have sharp edges poking out.</li>
    <li> I really like the figures, but in natural nails uffff....it&#x27;s really hard to glue it. I used a lot of clear enamel and nothing. Doesnt work.</li>
    <li> i love this product. its really easy to apply on nails stays on for a very long time and i can even reuse them. i love it</li>
    <li> small enough for nails.  before painting nails I used my thumb and pushed them down on a clean nail to get the curve I needed, was easy enough to do as they bend fairly easy.  they are flat so they will need bent.  I placed them on still sticky polish, and then added 2 top coats, it worked perfectly.  I got mostly Chanel, bows and butterflies....I did not count them so can&#x27;t tell you how many was in the bag.  They arrived fairly quick all mixed in 1 baggy.</li>
    <li> i have not used them, but they look really nice, i would like to have more designs though, otherwise, really nice product! adn shipping was good too, no mess!</li>
    <li> first of all it took for ever for them to get here! + they are not curved so it takes a while to adjust them + there are hardly 100 of them but they look exactly like the picture</li>
    <li> Cute designs but very tiny and I have to separate them myself&lt;br /&gt;Only has 5 designs&lt;br /&gt;Still a good deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery didnt take as long as I expected</li>
    <li> I bought this set and was very surprised with how quickly it came. I can&#x27;t wait to use them. Will definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> Shipping was way faster than I thought it was going to be! It can in a small package, at first I was thinking , &amp;#34;is this thing empty?&amp;#34; but when I opened it I was pleasantly surprised!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> these are adorable and look soooo cute. stay on, dont flake, dont break.</li>
    <li> it is vrey good. A bag full.i like it .it is Very cute and easy to use.Quantity is enough. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is good , pretty, buuut, it don&#x27;t stay in the nail,,, :-(</li>
    <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
    <li> There was no chanel sign in the package and the only reason i ordered this item was for the chanel signs that were show in the picture</li>
