<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream in combo with organic coconut cream for 2 yrs. I was in a store last wk and the cashier asked if I had small children. They had a sale on crafts for children. I laughed and thanked her, told her I&#x27;d be 71 next month! She said no way what do u use. Love sharing my routing and your product!!</li>
    <li> the cream is heavy and almost pasty, i prefer something lighter, takes a little longer to absorb.will probably try something else next time</li>
    <li> Nice product, fast delivery and price can beat that I will buy again soon from them.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Beauty Without Cruelty Vitamin C with CoQ10 Renewal Cream\\&quot; is a great product that has never caused a single breakout on my oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin in several years of use.  It made a slight but noticeable difference in the look of the wrinkles around my eyes.  If you have very dry skin, you will need a heavier moisturizer over it at night - this cream is very thick but it is not heavy or greasy.  It simply seems \\&quot;concentrated\\&quot;.  I am prone to breakouts and I use a dab of this cream mixed with a little water (or mixed with Garnier&#x27;s great \\&quot;Moisture Rescue Gel-Cream\\&quot;) all over my face when the weather is dry.  I use it full strength at night around my eyes.  For a product junkie like me, one repurchase is a big deal - let alone sticking with the same product for years.  I indulge my curiosity sometimes and buy cool new creams and lotions when they come out (again, product junkie), but I&#x27;ve never let myself run out of this, and have never found anything that is as effective without breaking me out.  For those concerned about fragrance, it has a mild, organic-y smell.  No fake fragrance, but it&#x27;s not without smell entirely.</li>
    <li> Really like this product,  use it every time i wash my face, and under my eyes at bed time. I put it on after i shave my face and it doesn&#x27;t burn or cause breakouts like other products have,will be buying again.</li>
    <li> for the price, excellent product</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t given it enough time yet.</li>
    <li> Great cream. I was amazed how quickly it absorbed into my skin.</li>
    <li> Very timely,reached as expected and a very good product. I loved it.</li>
    <li> I finally bought the matching moisturizer when I was on my 2nd bottle of the matching cleanser and I am glad that I did.  My skin used to feel so inflamed but now between this cleanser and moisturizer, my skin feels balanced.  It is reasonably priced for something that is so wonderful!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great lotion if you are watching the chemicals that products have. I thought it was a great price for the size. It will easily last six months to a year. It is very thick, similar to a body butter lotion, which is a bit off putting but, it isn&#x27;t greasy or oily once you start putting it on.  The only negative I have is after exfoliating be careful because it will sting a bit (maybe the vitamin c?). I do use a different lotion when I exfoliate but BWC is my daily lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful natural product. It has a light citrus smell which I enjoy. The cream is somewhat thick but is a good consistency to wear under makeup for mositurizing protection throughout the day. It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy but is a good amount of moisture. You don&#x27;t need much product to cover your whole face and the jar is a good size that would definitely last a few months. Great price too. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great for my skin.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> this ia a great product that not greasy, has softened and reduced wrinkle lines noticably after first jar.goes a long way at a resonable price. yes, men use this type product too.</li>
    <li> This product is cruelty-free, not expensive and it feels good on my face.  I&#x27;m on my second jar and plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> ~~~I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks &amp; see a little difference... But, it was said that it would take a couple months before I would see a change so I&#x27;m going to use until it is used up &amp; if I see a difference I&#x27;ll buy another jar...</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer for my overnight cream.  A little of it goes a long way.  My face has responded well to this regiment.</li>
    <li> the smell is not great but goes on smooth  can not tell any difference with or without it still using it and hoping</li>
    <li> This has a nice creamy texture and is not greasy.  I don&#x27;t know if the Vitamin C and coq10 is helping my skin or not, but it is nice to use anyway.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, not too heavy, and I use this at night as well as after using the needle roller.  Great price!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and this is the best for my face.  I also love that it is cruelty free!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I do like this cream.  I don&#x27;t really like the smell, but I like that it is thick.  You only need to use a little, it goes along way. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this facial cream</li>
    <li> This cream works for me.  It feels good going on and it appears to make a real difference on my skin. Works better than all the expensive creams that I have experimented with.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin, not too heavy this is a very good moisturizer. I have sensitive skin as well.</li>
    <li> Got the product quick.  Creamy and smells nice.  Goes on light and leaves my skin dewy soft.  Appreciate that no animals were used for testing.</li>
    <li> Good product!  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I did not notice any real difference when comparing this with other products that i found to work better... This has Fragrance in it also.... Not a fan of Fragrance and i don&#x27;t trust the ingredients that most fragrances are made of...</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I apply it at night after a bath and exfoliating my face.  I wake up fresh, my skin is so smooth and glowing!</li>
    <li> Fine product for the price. Again, same ingredients as much more expensive products. Make sure you buy with the Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful  face cream. Vitamin C and coQ10 keep my skin bright and lightens darker spots. Keeps skin hydrated without that oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Love this vitamin c cream. Noticed a difference on my face right away! Highly recommend you buy THIS cream.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream without the fancy expensive marketing bottles and annoying pumps that is nothing but work.  A simple jar with a powerful cream.</li>
    <li> product and service were good</li>
    <li> It seems like a good product, i havent used it long enough to see if it helps my skin ,</li>
    <li> I love BWC products.  This skin cream is thick and rich--excellent for dry skin.  I never have any issues with burning eyes or blemished skin when using it; I&#x27;ve found many of the BWC lotions to be quite good, but this one is my favorite--my skin feels great and looks great.  I couple this with the facial cleanser of the same type.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I HATE spending time with cleaners and lotions and everything that doesn&#x27;t work anyway.&lt;br /&gt;This cream goes on so smoothly...takes seconds...done...out of her.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer.  I was looking for a more natural product. The Vitamin C did make my fair Scandinavian skin turn slightly pink a couple of times, but I really like the moisturizer.  I&#x27;d buy I again.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product, but I love it so much!&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this on a continual basis.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> feels terrible and heavy</li>
    <li> Listed IN ORDER on jar.&lt;br /&gt;purified water, Aloe barbadensis (aloe verra) leaf juice, GLYCERINE, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, POLYSORBATE -60, cetearyl ALCOHOL, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, steric acid, glyceryl monolaurate, ETHYL HEXYL PALMITATE, Linium usitatissimum (flax seed) oil, Rosa canina (rose hip) oil, Citrus aurantium (neroli) oil, Citrus Ssinensis (sweet orange) oil, ...&lt;br /&gt;ok so now I will skip several good things they DO list and then you come to the end at,&lt;br /&gt;tocopheral, panthenol, tocopheral acetate,  ... phenoxyethaonal finishing with benzyl alcohol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY Disappointed with the ingredients and misleading (at least to me) statements of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;Will NOT purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I try other products but keep coming back to this one. It is perfect for my face, neck and chest. I am 64 years old, and I will not say that this, or any product, makes me look 40. However, it is a great consistency, feels wonderful, and makes what make-up I wear look better than other products do. I may seem cautious in my comments after giving this 5 stars, however, the fantastic claims made by more expensive products really turn me off. I have been ripped off by many through the years! This product is simply perfect.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with this vitamin C cream. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Initially, this stuff made me break out like crazy.  It&#x27;s pretty oily.  But I&#x27;m looking for a cruelty free product with coq10.  So far I&#x27;ve only found 2, and this is one of them.  After I used it longer, my face adjusted and did clear up.  The price is definitely right, but I&#x27;m not in love with the product.  I&#x27;m in the middle of trying another cream and so far I prefer it, but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.  I might return to this in the future if I can&#x27;t find something better.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t write a review until now, used it for several months. I gave this a four star because I didn&#x27;t see a big change on my skin but it did keep it moist. I recommend it, maybe some people will notice a bigger change. I bought it mainly because I like this company and cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Finally people are understanding quality products!- even though BWC has got it for years. Excellent line!</li>
    <li> Love this as a daily moisturizer! Creamy texture, safe to use, non toxic so I don&#x27;t break out after using it.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this stuff.  I am 54 years old and it helps my skin look and feel younger.  It may bother your eyes if you put it on near them during the day so if it does just use it at night.</li>
    <li> I was interested in this brand and decided to try based on reviews. A few days before it arrived, I had &amp;#34;ruined&amp;#34; my complexion by trying 2 different fade creams/illuminators. My whole face was ruddy, and I had these red itchy bumps and little pimples all over my face. Obviously an allergic reaction. I&#x27;m 53 and felt like a teenager again, but not in a good way. Thank goodness it, along with the Vitamin C Facial Cleanser, arrived sooner than expected, 3 days after this ruddiness/rash/breakout started. I cleansed my face and applied the Renewal Cream, a little worried that I might react to the essential oils in the products and make things worse, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the results after one use.  I woke up the next morning to see 80% of my face had not only cleared up, but had a glow and more beautiful tone than even before I reacted to the fade creams. I will say that the renewal cream does not provide enough moisture for me right now during this horrible winter weather...my skin has never dried out so much during a winter...and I use the Olay moisturizer I have on top of the Vitamin C cream.  It works well enough that I may not need another moisturizer in the summer. Not every product will give everyone the same results, and there&#x27;s always that chance of an allergic reaction, but boy, am I glad I found BWC!  They work very well for me, and I will be trying more of their products.</li>
    <li> I would have to use this product longer than just one jar to tell if it made any difference in my skin.  There were no miraculous things that I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was good.  The smell was not pleasant. It didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial moisturizer!  I&#x27;m now on my second jar of it and very pleased.  The cream is very thick, and a little goes a long way- in fact, I think I would still be on my first jar after three months of use if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that my husband tried it once after some prodding from me and started using it too.  I have evil combination skin that gets horribly dry in the winter, and this stuff is one of the few nice, heavy moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t break me out or leave me feeling like I rubbed a stick of butter all over my face.  Good stuff, I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice, and pleasant mild scent.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer leaves my skin soft and glowing. It seems to even out my skin tone as well. I&#x27;m on my third little tub of this stuff, and I intend to use it forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it I didn&#x27;t really notice my skin changing, but when I stopped for a brief time I could tell immediately that my skin wasn&#x27;t looking so hot. I started looking dull, blotchy, and tired. Got back on it and will never go back. It just seems to brighten up my face. I really like the smell of it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne-prone skin with some redness on my cheeks, and this moisturizer just deals with all of that. It evens out my skin tone. I wear so much less makeup now, and can even go without foundation. Stick with it for a couple of weeks! You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Im not sure this is the cream for me...its nice, but i dont like the way it feels on my skin...the plus is its cruelty free...ive been using this cream for a few weeks now, along with hyaluronic acid and argan oil...i probably won&#x27;t buy this again...but it may work well for you</li>
    <li> I like the creamy feel, the light scent and how it never feels greasy. My skin feels great too, it is just normalized. I am reordering because it&#x27;s been so great and I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 1 year, which is unheard of for me. I was constantly switching moisturizers, trying to find something that worked well with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 21, have very fair and very dry skin. It&#x27;s mildly sensitive, and I was worried I might have a reaction to the essential oils in this lotion, as other reviewers stated they had allergic reactions to it. After all that, my skin is prone to break outs so this lotion has literally been a MIRACLE for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before, I used Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar moisturizer for dry skin. This was WAY to expensive ($40 for 2 oz!!!) and made my skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t believe I found something that has continued to work for a year for my skin. (I started trying different products when my dry face started itching at the age of only 11!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BWC Vitamin C lotion is wonderful. I had to get used to the sort of woody scent (essential oils I&#x27;m guessing) But since I started using it, my skin has never been better and I really like the smell. Less break-outs (hormones still cause me to break out sometimes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**My own little secret**: Add almond oil to this lotion. It makes it last twice as long AND gives your skin even more of a soft glow. I just save my old containers so I have something to mix it in. Start out with a drop or two and see how it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I also bought this lotion for my sister who has acne scars. In the past 6 months, her scars are drastically less visible and her face has a glow that I&#x27;ve never seen it have before.</li>
    <li> This is IMHO one of the best mosturizers around. It is a thick and creamy lotion but doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy, greasy feeling on your skin. I use the Facial Cleanser in this product followed by the moisturizer and my skin looks healthier, and always feels so soft. This will last probably a good 6 months as you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
    <li> not oily for a thick cream, it might sting if it gets to the eye.  Face is soft after 2 days</li>
    <li> Maybe I have a delicate sense of smell. But before I bought the product I read in a review that the smell should be pleasant. Having had the cream on for a few hours, I have to wash it off because it stank so terrible! The cream went straight in the bin! If you like to smell good, I would highly discourage you this cream! It also left my skin olied.</li>
    <li> Its very moisturizing and keeps my skin good all day</li>
    <li> I use this every night.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This cream feels great on my face and the combination of the Vit C and coq 10 really feels nourishing.</li>
    <li> This creme works wonders.  I just wanted to add a Vitamin C creme because Dr Oz mentioned it.  I already use Roc and was  not looking for a replacement.  For winter I thought I might wear a vitamin C creme under my regular moisturizer, but since Roc has retinol and one reviewer said do not use C and retinol together I decided to wear the Vitamin C by itself overnight.  Instantly my face felt the difference.  Upon application my face felt the moisture.  Kind of like a nice drink of water does instantly after your body has gone without.  This happens every time it&#x27;s applied.  Now I wear it during the day not just over night.  My skin is smoother, softer, and brighter without glare.  I might be having a hard time admitting this little creme maybe better than my Roc.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I strongly prefer unscented products and bought this when a recommendation indicated the smell was inobtrusive.  Well, the smell is barely present and the absorption is quick.  It is not slimey or oily. The ingredient list is comforting. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the same time as the toner. I love the toner but this moisturizer not so much. I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements in my skin and as far as moisturizer, I can&#x27;t use it during the day because it peels and leaves the white pieces all over. Won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Choosing CRUELTY FREE cosmetics and cleaning products is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;This works very well as an evening moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Used sparingly it would work for daytime or under makeup.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell, but at first it was kind of off putting, my biggest problem with this product is the fact that it balls up on itself. I can&#x27;t apply make up over the top of it, and it just feels gritty and disgusting. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I&#x27;ve noticed no difference with using this product.</li>
    <li> I like how this cream works, and I am very happy that the ingredients are natural and cruelty-free, but the lavender smell is overpowering. A little less scent would go a long way. However, I am pretty sensitive about these types of things so maybe I&#x27;m just being a baby...</li>
    <li> I LOVE this facial cream...goes on smooth, not greasy. best vitamin C/antioxidant cream I have ever tried... I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had never tried this brand before but I really like the lotion.  I wanted something with vitamin C in it for my face.  This feels nice and smells great.  Makes my skin soft.  I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my face.  Some other natural lotions will burn a little when I put them on but this does not.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product will amaze you. I loved it from the very first use. It&#x27;s a real good product for the money. The scent is heavenly . For ten bucks in change, ( the price use to be lower ) you really should give Beauty without Cruelty Renewal Moisturizer Vitamin C with coq10 A try. I am very picky about my face and what goes on it.  This is one of the few I will allow on my face.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of this vitamin C cream. I used to use a very pricey vitamin C serum from a popular shopping channel, and thought I would just try this cream instead. Since I have been using this at least a year, I feel that I can say that this is good for prevention of wrinkles, and puffiness under the eyes. I am 64 years old, am a nurse, and my patients comment daily that my face and complexion does not give away my age.</li>
    <li> Concerned with signs of aging, I purchased this product and it does what it promises.  Many people asked me what I was doing as they complimented my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m some older and need moisture, this fits my needs, have shred with my friends they loved it too, hope they buy from Amazone, because the price is the best.</li>
    <li> I like the product...it seems to work well not exceptional though. It is good just as to use a couple times throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This cream along with the Life Extension Skin Restoring Ceramides are suppose to clear many of my small wrinkles. Too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> CREAM OR CAKE? We&#x27;re not sure what went wrong with this cream, but the top layer was very hard and dry. It was necessary to dig into the container to find a more creamy consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE. Also, consumers need to be leery about the implied promises product packaging and labeling. This product is sold as a Vitamin C moisturizer. However, it&#x27;s main ingredients are the following: Organic aloe vera gel, organic botanical infusion (chamomile, calendula, lavender), vegetable glycerin, organic safflower oil, organic shea butter, glyceryl stearate (from coconut oil), cetyl alcohol (from coconut oil), green tea extract, organic lavender hydrosol, organic cucumber extract. The other ingredients in much smaller quantities include vitamin C (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate), Coenzyme Q10, vitamin E (natural d-alpha tocopherol), panthenol (vitamin B factor), allantoin (skin-healing), organic rosehip seed oil (rosa rubiginosa), oat protein. There is likely another product on the market with more Vitamin C and CoQ10 than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONG DELIVERY TIME. Unrelated to the BWC product itself was the long delay before we received this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and plan to continue using it. The ingredients are great and I love the fact that it has added CoQ10, rosehip, flaxseed oil, and calendula. For half a year, I had to use less expensive skin care products and cut down on the items I used due to financial cutbacks. This eventually took a toll on my 33-year-old skin, causing it to become drier and with larger pores, saggier, and wrinkles to form. After trying countless other creams within the same price range, including Burt&#x27;s Bees, I decided to try this and those problems are slowly but surely fading after several months of use. That&#x27;s without the use of my usual serums/oils and other products that have worked so well. I also have really enjoyed using products that have fewer chemicals and more beneficial, natural ingredients, as it seems to be improving my skin long-term--though it did take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it an all-in-one miracle cream? Not really, or at least not by itself and not with immediate results, but the fact that it has good ingredients, is inexpensive, lasts a long time, and does its job has me continuing to use it. I also enjoy the fact that I feel like I&#x27;m not only keeping my skin moisturized, but also nourished and with fewer chemicals involved (it is not all-natural, unfortunately, but bears a low level of toxicity). I do believe in switching products up in order to benefit from other ingredients, but this is the one I turn to the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really thick, moisturizing cream, but it&#x27;s not sticky, it absorbs well into the skin, and you don&#x27;t need a lot, which means it&#x27;ll last a while. I just dab a few small dots along my forehead, cheeks, chin and nose. It&#x27;s made my skin much more supple and less saggy, pores are smaller, and any forming lines are less noticeable and continue to improve. The paperiness that tends to form around my eyes (no wrinkles yet) is more supple as well, which is something I&#x27;ve always struggled with. It does, however,have a tendency to make my combination-dry skin oily at night and by the time I wake up in the morning, but it&#x27;s not horrible and usually depends on the weather. If I feel that might happen, I&#x27;ll switch it up with Mychelle Grapefruit cream or the Maximum Moisture Cream by BWC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I am sensitive to smells and perfumes, the light fragrance isn&#x27;t hard to handle, unlike the Maximum Moisturizing Cream that has a heavy floral scent (I like that cream and use it occasionally, it&#x27;s just overly scented and a little heavier). Whatever scent is there eventually fades in a few minutes, and it&#x27;s not half as smelly as Burt&#x27;s or similar, lacking that herbaceous smell some products have--it smells more citrus mixed with a hint of floral to me. It also hasn&#x27;t caused problems with acne, short of the hormonal issues I get once a month. During those times, I use the Mychelle Grapefruit Cream, which works great for that, and may top it off with this cream once the other product sets in. I also try to wear sunscreen over this moisturizer when I go outside for prolonged period of time, generally due to the vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it to those who like products that are more natural, nourishing, and that won&#x27;t break the bank, especially if they have mature, dry, or combination-dry skin. Even though I plan to repurchase some of the serums I used before, just for added benefit, I will continue to use this as my staple moisturizer. I also plan to get the body lotion version since this has worked so well on my face, and eventually plan to use collagen and CoQ10 supplements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re brand new to using mostly-natural items (like Burts and BWC), but rather are used to lotions like Oil of Olay, you may be in for a bit of a shock due to the thickness and it can take some getting used to. With products like this, you don&#x27;t need a lot--too much and you will go into grease bomb mode. Start off with a very, very small amount and add more later if you need it. I do a dot on each quadrant. I also love their leave-in conditioner for my Hermione Granger type hair, though that does have kind of an herbaceous smell that fades. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full, current ingredients are: Purified Water, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (organic), Glycerin, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Polysorbate 60, Cetearyl Alcohol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (organic), Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Monolaurate, Ethyl Hexyl Palmitate, Linum Usitatissimum Oil (Flax seed) (organic), Rosa Canina (Rose Hip) Oil (organic), Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Extract (organic), Calendula Officinalis (Calendula) Extract (organic), Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract (organic), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter (organic), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil (organic), Citrus Aurantium (Sweet Orange) Oil (organic), Cananga Odorata (Ylang Ylang) Flower Essential Oil, Lavandula Hybrida (Lavandin) Oil (organic), Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Oil (organic), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Prunus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Calophyllum Inophyllum (tamanu) Oil, Squalane (Vegetable source), Coenzyme Q10, Tocopherols, Panthenol, Tocopherol Acetate, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Soy Lecithin, Allantoin, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, ethyl hexyl glycerin, Benzyl Alcohol</li>
    <li> I will continue to order this product</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND WAS PREVIOUSLY PURCHASING AT VITAMIN SHOP FOR MUCH MORE.  GLAD TO FIND IT CHEAPER ON AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;KEEPS THE SKIN LOOKING GLOWFUL.  BEEN USING FOR OVER A YEAR AND MY SKIN LOOKS VERY HEALTHY</li>
    <li> I really like everything about this cream. The texture, the smell, the consistency. I put it on before applying my make up and it goes on smooth it doesn&#x27;t peel under the make up. I like it that is thick because I combine it with drops of liquid vitamin K and it ends up being the right consistency. I have two big wrinkles by the side of my mouth and you can barely see it since I&#x27;ve been using this cream. I am not saying that it makes wrinkles dissappear but it keeps the skin soft, plumped up and moist where you can barely see the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I recommend this cream for all my friends. I got rid of spot in my face using this product, it&#x27;s the most cheaper cream.</li>
    <li> Wow.. So I was skeptical abt this one since I&#x27;ve never heard of the brand b4. What sold me were the reviews and of course the fact that it is manufactured without cruelty to animals. Boy am I glad I went with my instincts! Yes it does have a thick and creamy consistency, but once applied to the skin, it instantly absorbs, without leaving any oily residue. I am quite impressed with the effect. Leaves the skin supple and glowing. Highly reccomended. Also due to the consistency, it looks like it would last nicely..</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff</li>
    <li> This stuff is just awesome.  My skin feels softer but not greasy.  My skin looks better, and the dry spots go away over time.  Works well on the rough spots on my hands, too.</li>
    <li> I was using a vitamin c product before I ordered the BWC cream.  BWC is not as drying but best of all, not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer and since it is thicker than day creams, I put it on at night. Thanks for the great pricing too!</li>
    <li> Did not notice much of a difference or do what the product claimed to do but still a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> LIKE THE PRODUCT, IT&#x27;S JUST TOO THICK, ADD A LITTLE WATER IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND TO THIN IT OUT. IT&#x27;S HEAVLY PERFUMED WITH SOMETHING, NOT A BAD SMELL, BUT IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOU.</li>
    <li> Like the creaminess but do not really care for the smell</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past two and a half months faithfully. In fact, I am on my second jar. What have I noticed? I have seen my brown spots getting darker and have noticed more. I am so disappointed. Don&#x27;t know what the hype is all about. One more thing to waste our money on I suppose. The reason why I gave it two stars is because it smells good and did seem to moisturize. By the way.... I&#x27;m 52 years old.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best facial cream I have ever used. I have sensitive skin, this cream has never caused a reaction like many other products I have used in the past. This product has become a staple in my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I really had no great expectations when purchasing this cream. I&#x27;ve had very dry skin all my life. And while I have used many different moisturizers and lotions, NOTHING has worked like BWC! I&#x27;ve used moisturizers that left a greasy film, that would leave my face feeling dry like 2hrs later or less, and that have even made my face still feel tight and dry regardless. So imagine my surprise when this product came along. Have to admit I was a bit taken aback by how small the container was upon opening the package. However, as soon as I put this cream on my skin...just WOW!!! It&#x27;s thick(but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy), it smells nice(but not overpowering), you don&#x27;t have to use much(despite size made it well worth the price), and most of all it left my skin feeling hydrated for the entire day! That was what really sold me and caused me to order more. I would go through my facial routine at 6am and by the time I returned home in the evening at 8pm my face still felt hydrated and soft to the touch. This really is the only moisturizer I will ever need! My sister whom has very different skin, oily, has used it and has been singing its praises as well. So much so I had to buy her her own to stop her from using mine! lol It leaves her face feeling clean and not oily or shiny by the end of the days as usually happens to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot say enough good things about this product! Anyone with dry(or oily) skin should give this a try. I promise you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I had a reaction. Red blotches appeared when used on my face.</li>
    <li> Wonderful thick lotion that I use for my face.  I have been looking for a cruelty free lotion and just happened to come across this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for a long time now. This is NOT the same reveal cream I&#x27;ve been purchasing from the health food store. I can tell a difference in consistency and it is making my face breaknout. Purached from Amazon to save money, very dissappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I would recommend it to everyone, and the price is very reasonable. I am ready to purchase another jar.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I am benefiting from the product but Its not greasy which Iike. And has a nice scent to it.</li>
    <li> It has a good smooth texture but haven&#x27;t seen any difference so far. Will keep using it and see if there is any improvement</li>
    <li> I really liked the way it made my skin feel.  My skin felt soft and not greasy, yet was really moisturized.</li>
    <li> When I opened this cream, I noticed the consistency was completely different from the other 2 I have purchased in the past, not necessarily from this seller. It appeared old, perhaps? It was completely waxy and not creamy. The expiration date was not past due as labeled on the bottom but clearly something was not right about it.</li>
    <li> Vitamin always a good item to have . Recomended by many Dr..</li>
    <li> This is not 100% cruelty free!!! I use EWG.org to verify what products are hazardous (on a scale from 1-10, 10 being highly toxic) and this product is not listed but I bought it anyway because I have slight sunspots now that I&#x27;m near 30 and figured vitamin C and CoQ10 would help. NO! This made my pores HUGE that It made me look pourous like an orange! The first day I got it I tried it and I like the creamy texture but it is VERY heavily fragranced, the smell is in btwn california baby cream and ponds cold cream. VERY STRONG SCENT! I don&#x27;t like the scent but I would&#x27;ve dealt with it, had it been a good product. The second time I tried this it started burning around my nose area. The third time, my whole face burned and had a stinging sensation...probably due to my pores being open. My pores do not react this way unless their are chemicals in the ingredients. I have been using 0 hazardous cream on my face and my pores aren&#x27;t even visible but I need something to brighten my face and rid those sunspots...I guess I might try sweesationtherapy next. I am currently using Bioelements \\&quot;all things pure\\&quot; line and it is 0 hazardous and VERY GOOD for your skin! I need something that&#x27;s effective and not toxic and this product didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s standards...sorry DID not like. If  you want something that will do similar effects to your face/skin then just go to the store and buy CeraVe pm because my face and pores react in the same way with that as with this. This probably has good ingredients but defeats the purpose with bad chems as well and why is their a * next to the good ingredients, that made me question the percentage that&#x27;s actually in this cream. If anyone can refer me to a good nontoxic cream for my sunspots or 30 yr old skin then please let me know..otherwise I will stick to bioelements, coconut oil, and EVOO. Returning this today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;3/26/13&lt;br /&gt;So I printed a label and returned the item and They will not refund me. If you happen to have a reaction to this product then WARNING, there is no refunds! I am now without product and a refund BUT WAIT..it gets better, Thank goodness Amazon does A-to-Z claim...they issued me my refund!I LOVE AMAZON!tion to this product then WARNING, there is no refunds! I am now without product and a refund BUT WAIT..it gets better, Thank goodness Amazon does A-to-Z claim...they issued me my refund!I LOVE AMAZON!</li>
    <li> I love this product within a week you start to see results. I was amazed because it is recommended that you use it twice a day, however I only use it in the morning and have experienced amazing results...I&#x27;m going to stock up on a few more bottles</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer. I am still using it, no spectacular results, but didn&#x27;t do any harm. I would recommend this moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Feels great non-greasy hopefully I will see good results long term</li>
    <li> I love this cream...very light and smells pure.</li>
    <li> Great!!!arrived on time</li>
    <li> Very soothing and effective to maintain nice smooth skin....I think it helps keeping my face more youthful......</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an evening moisturizer with vitamin c and q10 for a while. Glad I found the one for me. I always used aveeno products but felt the need to change my evening cream because I am getting older. Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I have sensitive skin and tend to get dry patches in some areas and breakouts in others. I&#x27;ve used this as a part of my new skin regimen (along with acnedote wash and spot treatment) and my skin has cleared up. The texture is really smooth and it smells great.</li>
    <li> great stuff. I like a lot great for my skin day and night  NOT heavy or greasy. One of the BIG bonus is that it does NOT exploit animals to experiment typically  small docile dogs.</li>
