      <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
      <li>AWESOME THANKS!!!</li>
      <li>I am sooo glad I did!</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I found it here!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s fade cream for many years successfully.</li>
      <li>My face looks very bright, fresh and supple.</li>
      <li>It tones my face nicely</li>
      <li>the cream smells good like onivia lotion light scented !</li>
      <li>I really liked the product</li>
      <li>I can also honestly say that if i run out this stuff before i get my desired results, i will buy another jar.</li>
      <li>the consistency of it is nice too.</li>
      <li>I used to shop at Sephora, paying upwards of $50 or more for products that weren&#x27;t as effective as this.</li>
      <li>I started using in March while I was still in college, and when I got back home in May for summer break EVERYONE that I was close to, basically my best friends and family, all were complementing me on how nice my skin looks now.</li>
      <li>I basically don&#x27;t have any scars on my forehead anymore and the scars on my cheek are very very light.</li>
      <li>Pleasant, but strong smell, absorbs quickly into the skin, great price, but did not do much of anything for me.</li>
      <li>It has been so many years and come summer season</li>
      <li>I hope this works for you. :-)</li>
      <li>so I am pleased.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t cause more breakouts for me</li>
      <li>my skin is a lot lighter and more evened out after using this product</li>
      <li>But then that is the case for many creams but the trade off</li>
      <li>For the price I don&#x27;t think you could get a better working product.</li>
      <li>This is even better than the one I had before.</li>
      <li>and it did magic,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not too sure if this product works.</li>
      <li>I also have the skin tone evening face mask by palmers, which I notice more impact from than the face cream.</li>
      <li>For others, there are better alternatives.</li>
      <li>I have received so many compliments.</li>
      <li>But I was willing to give it a try, based on the good reviews.</li>
      <li>I did research on the alpha hydroxy ingredient on the label and it turns out it works best on dry skin.</li>
      <li>My conclusion now is that there are a lot of &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; positive reviews!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement on the acne scars that I have had for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I really want my skin to look nice</li>
      <li>Great face care product with low price</li>
      <li>My skin always looks fantastic after I use it.</li>
      <li>but I rather use a Hydroquinone- free product.</li>
      <li>This is the best fade cream I&#x27;ve used especially for my very oily skin.  </li>
      <li>Of course nothing happened the very first time i used it(Duh!), but after only a week of using this, i can honestly say that i&#x27;m already seeing results!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since I was a little girl and its AMAZING!!</li>
      <li>My face is clear and clean, love it!</li>
      <li>like really fast I&#x27;m going to put more on tonight before bed and wash my face in the morning</li>
      <li>but its true</li>
      <li>my face changed for good ,so i recomend all palmers products i have been using since i was a teen.</li>
      <li>The two of them together were amazing, and after only about week I began to observe improvement with the freckles.</li>
      <li>Why it is sold as a product for oily skin is beyond me because once applied it doesnt get absorbed at all.</li>
      <li>so other women or men will know it is good</li>
      <li>But I didn&#x27;t realized right away that this cream was messing up my skin .</li>
      <li>right under my eyes.</li>
      <li>It has been two months now, I am still on my first jar and my skin already looks exactly like it did before my skin nightmare begin!</li>
      <li>have also more recently begun to spot-apply it to a great big dark freckle I have right on the end of my nose, so that one might be a better test for whether it lightens these darker freckles or not.</li>
      <li>I hope this helps because I was cautious at first</li>
      <li>so you got to be very patient!</li>
      <li>but this does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>That is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
      <li>first when i thought about buying this product, i was like, \\&quot;It&#x27;s probably not gonna work anyways\\</li>
      <li>but I really like it!</li>
      <li>Compared to Fair and Lovely multivitamin, which had results in roughly 2 weeks for me, this one shows some change but not a whole lot.</li>
      <li>But overall the product really does work. :)</li>
      <li>Nothing surprising about the texture, creamy not too thick nor slimy, just right.</li>
      <li>Came pretty fast, one day before estimated delivery date, and i put it on my nightstand.</li>
      <li>I have used this product in the past with good results</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had mixed feelings about using this product in the first place, primarily because it does contain Hydroquinone, a known carcinogenic.</li>
      <li>I am a lucky adult with acne</li>
      <li>maybe the vitamin c along with the alphahydroxy that makes this more superior than other fade creams I used in the past</li>
      <li>I think it would be hard to find a product as good as this one</li>
      <li>For now I give the product 4 stars though I think if I could I&#x27;d really rather give 3 and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it works fast there too</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not greasy, you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>but so is doing too much of ANYTHING... as well as drinking too much water.  </li>
      <li>This really works for me.</li>
      <li>and it was very drying.</li>
      <li>the very supplier I bought from had reallocated to the states.</li>
      <li>and it works very well</li>
      <li>/&gt;you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot of this product at all.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s working fast</li>
      <li>It used to be in Sephora products, but when they removed it a few years ago, I found their products weren&#x27;t as effective.</li>
      <li>With all the expensive products I&#x27;ve used, this is by far the best... and sells for about $5.50 on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I am so satisfied with this product that I am ready to purchase the other types like lotions etc.</li>
      <li>I usually wear it at night and in the morning I use a Vita C lotion (which smells and feels great) and a simple face lotion with sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Works but not as good as black and white bleach cream and after awhile it turns orange</li>
      <li>as for older scars that have set in, i have no opinion.    </li>
      <li>This product works better than all the more expensive spot removers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a week or so, but it feels much better on my face than the regular version</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any particular scars</li>
      <li>I will be ordering another one when it runs out too and am excited to see the long term effects of this cream.</li>
      <li>so I highly recommend for people need to repair their skin tone</li>
      <li>Highly recommend Fade Cream, by Palmer</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ive used this product for about a month now. It may not seem like alot of time for some, but I expected by that time to have noticed some improvements. This product is hit or miss in my opinion. Some of my dark spots did clear up. Others still stare at me in the mirror every morning. I did research on the alpha hydroxy ingredient on the label and it turns out it works best on dry skin. Why it is sold as a product for oily skin is beyond me because once applied it doesnt get absorbed at all. Most of the time it just sits on my skin, blocking my pores and causing alot of oil to be produced which is bad. Compared to Fair and Lovely multivitamin, which had results in roughly 2 weeks for me, this one shows some change but not a whole lot. And claiming to have sunscreen without an spf rating is just silly. I would only recommend this product to people with dry skin. For others, there are better alternatives.</li>
    <li> It tones my face nicely</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks now, but i&#x27;ve found that more recent scars have started to fade. as for older scars that have set in, i have no opinion.    now it has been 3-4 months since september and I have to say that it hasn&#x27;t done anything to fade old scars. it only works to prevent scars.</li>
    <li> my face changed for good ,so i recomend all palmers products i have been using since i was a teen.</li>
    <li> still half of this product is in the jar but I can see improvements already,it&#x27;s not greasy, you don&#x27;t need to use much. I am so satisfied with this product that I am ready to purchase the other types like lotions etc. I used it for just two weeks and one of my friends saw a pic of me on FB an commented \\&quot;how you looking like you now leave school girl\\&quot;I am 40 years now, I rest my case.</li>
    <li> I first used this product in Singapore back in 1993. I have a typical problem, if I am exposed to sun for long duration I get more tanned on the side of temples, on side of cheeks it is like a patchwork. Within 3-4 day of using this cream I notice even skin tone. It has been so many years and come summer season it is a must cream even today. Although please note that if you apply this cream and if you are sweating it may irritate your eyes. But then that is the case for many creams but the trade off is that this product works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was a little girl and its AMAZING!! When I was younger, I had a really bad habit of popping my pimples. This would leave me with the ugliest scars on my face. My mother started to make me use this when I was around 14 and just a little bit on my face every night before bed not only cleared up my scars, but it also even out my skin tone. I hate the smell of it, but other than its a great product. I recently have a few scars I am trying to hide and have been searching for this everywhere and I am so glad I found it here! Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I had broke out with acne a couple years back and managed to clear my acne up by using proactive religiously. However, I was left with discoloration and dark pigmentations on my skin (I&#x27;m black). I tried ambi and other bleaching creams in the past with no success so I was about to pass up trying this product but decided to go ahead anyway. Can I tell you I am sooo glad I did! It has been two months now, I am still on my first jar and my skin already looks exactly like it did before my skin nightmare begin! My face looks very bright, fresh and supple. I think it maybe the vitamin c along with the alphahydroxy that makes this more superior than other fade creams I used in the past, I don&#x27;t know but this does exactly what it says. I started using this along with cetaphil facial cleanser for oily skin around the same time and the two together is a match made in skin Heaven for me!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any particular scars but I wanted my skin tone to even out so I didn&#x27;t have to bother with makeup. This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell great nor is the texture wonderful but I do like the way my skin looks. I usually wear it at night and in the morning I use a Vita C lotion (which smells and feels great) and a simple face lotion with sunscreen. This doesn&#x27;t make me break out and isn&#x27;t drying. I am a lucky adult with acne so some lotions are trouble. I also have the skin tone evening face mask by palmers, which I notice more impact from than the face cream. My skin always looks fantastic after I use it.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m 18, Black (skin color about the same as Will Smith&#x27;s), with slightly oily skin and prone to acne breakouts of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first when i thought about buying this product, i was like, \\&quot;It&#x27;s probably not gonna work anyways\\&quot; but i bought it anyway to at least give it try, seeing as i&#x27;ve already tried damn-near everything. Came pretty fast, one day before estimated delivery date, and i put it on my nightstand. A few hours later, i said \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; and decided to use it. Of course nothing happened the very first time i used it(Duh!), but after only a week of using this, i can honestly say that i&#x27;m already seeing results! Most of my acne scarring is fading from when i was a PREteen with HORRIBLE breakouts all over the place(lol), and a sunspot on my left cheek is fading as well from when i sit on the driver&#x27;s side of the car, but that isn&#x27;t as serious as my acne scarring, just a little discoloration. As an addition, i *THINK* this cream is keeping my acne at bay! (What?!!) I can also honestly say that if i run out this stuff before i get my desired results, i will buy another jar. I just wish it smelled a little different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as another note, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and this is NOT miracle cream and won&#x27;t work in a day. You have to keep using and using it until you get the results you want. I usually apply it when i wake up in the morning, and before i go to bed at night.</li>
    <li> Sadly the cream simply does not work, but I should have known that before I ordered it. Just hoping I guess.</li>
    <li> I have used the most expensive stuff including Triluma ($190.00 a tube because insurance is no longer pay for these stuff), NOTHING WORKS!.  I have very bad plasma (pregnancy mark) right under my eyes. the plasma are so dark that even thick double matte foundation of Estee Lauder couldn&#x27;t hide them.  But OH GOSH, this stuff works.  The acne soap is wonderful too. The only thing I am worry about is that these stuff has 2%Hydroquine, if I use them too long, would that have any effect on my health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used 2% hydroquinone creams in the past without noticing results, so I was wary about this one; but it was cheap and I was getting desperate. I used it for the purpose of removing unsightly freckles on my chest. A lot of lotions make me get pimples on my chest if I use them, but after nearly 2 months I haven&#x27;t had such a problem with this one at all -- woo hoo! As to its fading properties, it&#x27;s been very slow and for a while I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working or not. As of this time, it seems to have removed the lighter freckles, but the large dark ones are still plainly visible (I am unsure whether they lightened at all or not -- the package does warn results might not be noticeable on \\&quot;very dark skin\\&quot; and perhaps freckles are included in that designation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also more recently begun to spot-apply it to a great big dark freckle I have right on the end of my nose, so that one might be a better test for whether it lightens these darker freckles or not. I intend to update the review with results on that. For now I give the product 4 stars though I think if I could I&#x27;d really rather give 3 and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So shortly after I wrote the review, I ended up spending 6 weeks traveling, during which time I left the fade cream at home. I was a little disappointed that the freckles seemed to all come back rather quickly, even though I was in a cold climate and was almost always covered up. Nevertheless, when I returned I resumed the use, along with some [[ASIN:B002UFJ66M Likas Papaya Herbal Whitening Soap]]. The two of them together were amazing, and after only about week I began to observe improvement with the freckles.</li>
    <li> This cream is incredible. It starts noticeably fading discoloration of the skin after just a few days use.</li>
    <li> i WENT TO HAWAII AND GOT A HORRIBLE TAN, I LOOKED TOO DARK MY FACE LOOKED WEIRD, SO BOUGHT THIS, AND WITHIN 1 WEEK I SAW A DIFFERENCE. IT DOESNT CLOG MY PORES. PLUS IT CAME WITH A FREE SOAP!!! AWESOME THANKS!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too sure if this product works. After a few days of use (once a day), i broke out in areas where applied and it was very drying.</li>
    <li> Been using this cream faithfully and no results. Dark spots still there!</li>
    <li> Great quality, oily skin becomes smooth and look great! I will order this once again as soon as I ran out! Would definitely advise to everyone!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this long enough but I see improvement..</li>
    <li> So far so good..broke me out first week, my skin got used to it by the 2nd week..fading the burnt I got from TCA Peel... my face is brighter than before use.</li>
    <li> This product works better than all the more expensive spot removers. I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue to. It simply works!</li>
    <li> Did not fade spots as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I had dark marks on the arms.  The product worked well, the dark spots are not a noticeable as they originally were.  Would definitely purchase this product again and keep a jar on my shelf just in case.  Highly recommend Fade Cream, by Palmer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week so far and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference! My skin usually breaks out really easily but this actually HELPS with the breakouts!</li>
    <li> Doesnt work, tried this for a month with no changes in skin appearance.</li>
    <li> I used to shop at Sephora, paying upwards of $50 or more for products that weren&#x27;t as effective as this. Hydroquinone is the active ingredient here that fades blemishes, dark spots and even freckles. It used to be in Sephora products, but when they removed it a few years ago, I found their products weren&#x27;t as effective. Palmers Skin Success also has SPF 15 to prevent sun exposure that would worsen dark spots. It wears a little thick, especially if the jar&#x27;s not sealed tight, but it works wonders and fades my acne blemishes and freckles by about 60-70%. When I stop wearing it is when they all return. I try to use it everyday, especially if I&#x27;m going to be outside. With all the expensive products I&#x27;ve used, this is by far the best... and sells for about $5.50 on Amazon. Who knew?</li>
    <li> This product made my skin break out into tiny little bumps. I have used this product in the past with good results so I think that the composition of this product must have been changed.</li>
    <li> It fades marks in just days. I use it everyday twice a day religiously. It&#x27;s also quite moisturizing. Only down is it turns brown with time.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes that this product would be helping in evening out my skin tone and fading the sun damage on my face (living in Phoenix, our skin is under a constant sun). Unfortunately, after using it for over 2 months, I really haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvement in skin evenness or fading of the discolorations on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had mixed feelings about using this product in the first place, primarily because it does contain Hydroquinone, a known carcinogenic. But I was willing to give it a try, based on the good reviews. Pleasant, but strong smell, absorbs quickly into the skin, great price, but did not do much of anything for me.</li>
    <li> Okay I&#x27;m very cautious about my skin because It&#x27;s very sensitive, oily and I had spots on my face from past breakouts that I wanted to go away especially because I&#x27;m going on a trip to Atlanta Ga and it&#x27;s for modeling so I really want my skin to look nice so far Iv&#x27;e used this product twice and it works very well it&#x27;s not oily it doesn&#x27;t cause more breakouts for me and it&#x27;s working fast like really fast I&#x27;m going to put more on tonight before bed and wash my face in the morning and I&#x27;m shore my spots will almost be gone because I can barely see them now I had to write this so other women or men will know it is good you can also put it on your body as well it works fast there too lol I hope this helps because I was cautious at first but I really like it!</li>
    <li> This does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do. My face is clear and clean, love it!</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people are happy with this product. That is why I bought it in the first place. Unfortunately, this product almost made my face fall apart. It covered my face with terrible acne and I have been dealing with it for over a year. I still have acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not know that a product could change my life this badly. Maybe it is just me, I do not know. Just be careful.</li>
    <li> not to bad, my son had some breakouts and so far this lotion is not causing any more pimples, I tried it myself and it absorbs quickly does not leave a residue or heavy feeling, although I have one critique, it has an odor of onion, sorry but its true in my opinion, I would still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great face care product with low price</li>
    <li> This product is not for people with sensitive skin frankly my skin isn&#x27;t all that sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had bad acne until I used this product I only used it for a few days and my whole face broke out in tiny bumps it looked terrible I thought it would work because I have used other palmer products with no problem but this one was not very good at all I won&#x27;t be buying this again</li>
    <li> It really helps fade away dark spots from acne, only thing is it smells funny.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This product does not work; do not waste your money! I saw a few negative reviews and a lot of good ones, so I thought that I should try it. My conclusion now is that there are a lot of &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; positive reviews!!! One suggestion is to check the reviews of people who have actually bought the product. When you read reviews, check this option.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s fade cream for many years successfully. I recently ran out of my last tub and was surprised to find there&#x27;s an oily skin version. This is even better than the one I had before. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week or so, but it feels much better on my face than the regular version and I can see it&#x27;s working similarly to how the regular version I used before did. The price is a little steep, but it does last a long time.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product it&#x27;s a good buy it helped me with the blemishes so I highly recommend for people need to repair their skin tone it&#x27;s als</li>
    <li> Works but not as good as black and white bleach cream and after awhile it turns orange</li>
    <li> This product worked GREAT on my skin. It got rid of my dark spots and made my skin look smoother. I started using in March while I was still in college, and when I got back home in May for summer break EVERYONE that I was close to, basically my best friends and family, all were complementing me on how nice my skin looks now. I used to have a bad problem with acne in the past, which resulted with dark scars all over my face, especially my cheeks and forehead. I basically don&#x27;t have any scars on my forehead anymore and the scars on my cheek are very very light. It is hardly noticeable. This lotion made my face glow. A flaw was that every time I stepped out in the sun I lost my glow and I&#x27;m already a dark- skinned black female. I wasn&#x27;t using this product to get lighter, it hardly made me lighter, it really just evened my skin tone and got rid of my scars. Another flaw is that I realized that this product contains Hydroquinone, which links to skin cancer. There&#x27;s only allowed to be 2% of this chemical in products in America, which I guess is a decent amount but I rather use a Hydroquinone- free product. I think it would be hard to find a product as good as this one but I&#x27;m going to continue searching :(</li>
    <li> it really works to lighten the dark marks!plus there is sunscreen to protect it from getting any darker. everyone should definately considered buying this. the consistency of it is nice too.</li>
    <li> Best fade cream ever but it takes some time so you got to be very patient! Give it at least 3 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now. I try to use it 7 days a week, once in the morning and evening but that doesn&#x27;t always happen. I&#x27;m using it to fade acne scars on lighter skinned african-american skin (similar shade to beyonce). I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement on the acne scars that I have had for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the one con is that this product stinks. :( but you are only using this product for a couple of minutes a day so you can suck it up and deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot of this product at all. a little bit goes a long way so you could have it for several months. i would say that theres at least 95% of the product left after having it for 2 months.</li>
    <li> ... And some of my lighter acne scars have already started to fade. I have oily skin and this cream doesn&#x27;t add to that. I put it on after I wash my face in the morning and in the evening and it seems to be working slowly but surely. It hasn&#x27;t broken me out or anything so I am pleased. For the price I don&#x27;t think you could get a better working product. It last pretty long too. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day so far and still have half the jar left. I will be ordering another one when it runs out too and am excited to see the long term effects of this cream.</li>
    <li> I used this product years back and it did magic,  cleared all the black heads and  gave me the smoothest face I never dreamt of having but unfortunately when it got finished I didn&#x27;t get some to buy again in Africa and the very supplier I bought from had reallocated to the states. I had no option  than to resort to other creams and my face got worse again. When I spotted this improved formulary online  with retinol I had no doubts that it will work again so I was very confident when I was purchasing it and lo and behold I never got disappointed. No bleaching skin,  it does the work so perfectly. I will buy it again again and again even if it takes that I have to place orders online all time.</li>
    <li> This is the best fade cream I&#x27;ve used especially for my very oily skin.  It actually does what it says, clears, evens skintone in approx. 6-8 weeks with continued use 2x daily.  I have received so many compliments.</li>
    <li> Nothing surprising about the texture, creamy not too thick nor slimy, just right. Just very little goes a long way. I use it night and day. Well see if it works, after I used it for two months. Just started using it two or three weeks now.</li>
    <li> I have used this product last summer, to fade ezcema patches on my chest, stomach, and back. To my surprise they cleared up within two weeks. Now I&#x27;m using it on my face, to clear up a few dark spots. It&#x27;s only been two days and it is working already.&lt;br /&gt;This one is not oily and thick like the regular one. Goes on smooth hardly has a smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have dark skin, like Nick Cannon&#x27;s color. This really works for me. Remember, all skin reacts different. I hope this works for you. :-)</li>
    <li> It has been almost a month since I got the cream. My acne scars have gotten a lot lighter compared to before I used the product.</li>
    <li> The product was not helpful after 2 months of use. Not to mention the fact that is recommended to not use products that contain hydroquin. It may help others but it did not help me at all.</li>
    <li> I deff see results my skin is a lot lighter and more evened out after using this product I also added some jojoba oil to it.</li>
    <li> I am a dark skinned African American women and I can honestly say that this product really did help to lighten the spots on my face, however the container that it is made can EASILY break or crack just from even placing down too hard on the counter. Also the only reason I stopped using this product was due to the smell. After a while it began to make me nauseous  and I just couldn&#x27;t bare with it any longer. But overall the product really does work. :)</li>
    <li> I used this product for like 2 months and my skin got really bad red like rash .. But I didn&#x27;t realized right away that this cream was messing up my skin . I am using seraphil cream now to try to fix my skin I hope it works . I never though that this cream was messing up skin cuz I never had any problem like that with other creams</li>
    <li> The stuff works no doubt.  I used it once a day and noticed my freckles lightening up after about 15 days of use.  I surfed WAY too much when I was younger and got lots of sun spots due to a lack of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lightens them up for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it bad for you?  Maybe.... but so is doing too much of ANYTHING... as well as drinking too much water.  so meh..</li>
    <li> Just received it the cream smells good like onivia lotion light scented ! But when its dry it feels hard on skin like a pimple cream so put a small amount only!! Its not a smooth cream if u put alot ur skin may b tight n itchy!! Over all its good!!</li>
