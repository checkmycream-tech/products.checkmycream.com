      <li>Nice and durable fragance.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and at a great price!</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance, I have worn this for years.</li>
      <li>Good product; Not too sweet; gotten some good comments..</li>
      <li>The faux leather wrap is a nice touch, and the cap fits well making it feel more Porsche than Chevy.  </li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t help but feel that it isn&#x27;t authentic.  </li>
      <li>love the product</li>
      <li>Get so many compliments and questions as to what i&#x27;m wearing.</li>
      <li>In my opinion I would spend the money on a better cologne.</li>
      <li>Even when you think its not on you, people will smell it am be pleased.</li>
      <li>A++ great soft smell, not overpowering at all and tons of complimants.</li>
      <li>To be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m not 100% sure that this is the real stuff.  </li>
      <li>Smells divine, projects fine for around 2 hours, but after that it becomes a skin scent and needs to be re-applied.</li>
      <li>Other than that, an excellent cologne, draws many compliments in the first hours of use.</li>
      <li>CH for men has a light feminine smell to it.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Nice, smooth, sexy, mature.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a very nice cologne.</li>
      <li>As of now, I am the unique one.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for good smelling cologne for not much money and not concerned about authenticity - you&#x27;ll probably be satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately it´s going to run out some day, but is one of the most delicious perfumes i ever had.</li>
      <li>Its unique right from the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GOOD FRAGRANCE TO SETTLE WITH FOR A LONG TIME</li>
      <li>with the addition of a subtly sweet warm mid note.  </li>
      <li>At any rate, while I don&#x27;t think this fragrance is, nor will be a classic, it is a welcome addition to my rotation and gives me something unique that I know not every other guy will be smelling like...until they read this review.  </li>
      <li>A great scent to wear everyday, at work, or going out.</li>
      <li>Perfume recommend it because it is soft and if more comes from Carolina Herrera and even recommend it because the truth Fragrances are these.</li>
      <li>It is 100% original Amazon is very responsable.</li>
      <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original.</li>
      <li>I love this cologne and have finally found my &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t want anyone else</li>
      <li>Try it out first and see what you think .</li>
      <li>My only gripe with the scent is that it is not one of my better performers in terms of longevity or staying power.  </li>
      <li>BTW best blind buy i have ever done.</li>
      <li>The One, L&#x27;Homme by Yves Saint Laurent, and my general wear for time in the clinic since it is easy on the nose - Acqua Di Gio.  </li>
      <li>Basically, just as other reviewers have stated, it smells like a nice leather jacket, couch, car interior, etc...</li>
      <li>It still smells good, and maybe different batches come out differently</li>
      <li>This Cologne is very manly, if you are a man that likes good, long lasting scents this is for you.</li>
      <li>I guess I had very high expectations.</li>
      <li>Delivery fast.</li>
      <li>First off, for comparison, my normal fragrance rotation consists of D&amp;G</li>
      <li>Okay, it was expected,.  </li>
      <li>I am a very picky about scents and have been looking for signature scent that is very versatile and this is it.</li>
      <li>i really recomend it</li>
      <li>So much to say about this scent.  </li>
      <li>It is masculine and sweet at the same time.</li>
      <li>Yes it has many great reviews here and you tube, but it is very weak to me and doesn&#x27;t last very long on my skin.</li>
      <li>It opens very sweet (but not sickly sweet like Invictus by Paco Rabanne, in my opinion).  </li>
      <li>So far its been a month</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great fake!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll edit this review in a few weeks or so to give further updates on it and to let you know if other people love this smell as much as I do!</li>
      <li>found this cologne in ARUBA but could not locate it in the states..as expected AMAZON came thru,,recieved as expected and original as the one i bought in the islands..highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 20 year old college student who was just looking for a new fragrance because my current Acqua di Gio is almost empty.</li>
      <li>Received on time expected and brand new as described it.</li>
      <li>Ive got a feeling that my bottle will receive a little nip/tuck very soon.</li>

    <li> an excellent product, exactly what is offered, excellent delivery times.</li>
    <li> Good Product, as described</li>
    <li> This Cologne is very manly, if you are a man that likes good, long lasting scents this is for you. You will not be disappointed and amazon&#x27;s service as usual is top notch.</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth, sexy, mature. A great scent to wear everyday, at work, or going out. Will need to re-apply after 4-6 hours as scent fades away. Don&#x27;t be a fool not to purchase this one.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, I have worn this for years.</li>
    <li> To be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m not 100% sure that this is the real stuff.  Packaging and everything looked legit, but I have a friend who has the same cologne purchased from an authorized dealer and it smells just slightly different and lasts longer than the one I purchased from Amazon.  When comparing the bottles, there were some subtle inconsistencies: the label on the bottom had different writing on it, there is a number etched on my bottle but not his, and the sprayer looks slightly different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong...It still smells good, and maybe different batches come out differently but I can&#x27;t help but feel that it isn&#x27;t authentic.  If you&#x27;re looking for good smelling cologne for not much money and not concerned about authenticity - you&#x27;ll probably be satisfied.  I will continue to wear it from time to time; however, my future cologne purchases will be from authorized dealers only.</li>
    <li> found this cologne in ARUBA but could not locate it in the states..as expected AMAZON came thru,,recieved as expected and original as the one i bought in the islands..highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So much to say about this scent.  First off, for comparison, my normal fragrance rotation consists of D&amp;G The One, L&#x27;Homme by Yves Saint Laurent, and my general wear for time in the clinic since it is easy on the nose - Acqua Di Gio.  That being said, CH Men is not like any of these fragrances.  It opens very sweet (but not sickly sweet like Invictus by Paco Rabanne, in my opinion).  Its unique right from the bottle.  After the dry down at times I get a hint of D&amp;G The One, and strangely enough, I sometimes would get a slight musk base (even though it isn&#x27;t listed as a base note) slightly similar to Abercrombie Fierce, but much better and not like a musk bomb just went off in your immediate area.  The sandalwood softens the fragrance, and gives it some warmth as well.  Basically, just as other reviewers have stated, it smells like a nice leather jacket, couch, car interior, etc...with the addition of a subtly sweet warm mid note.  My only gripe with the scent is that it is not one of my better performers in terms of longevity or staying power.  Olfactory fatigue is real with this, and I have never experienced it to this degree with any other scent.  Although, I have gotten compliments several hours after application, I feel 2-4 hours is my personal max.  At any rate, while I don&#x27;t think this fragrance is, nor will be a classic, it is a welcome addition to my rotation and gives me something unique that I know not every other guy will be smelling like...until they read this review.  Whoops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, not that it affects the fragrance, but the bottle and cap has a good feel to them.  The faux leather wrap is a nice touch, and the cap fits well making it feel more Porsche than Chevy.  The one thing I can&#x27;t wrap my mind around is the dangling CH emblem that is always in the way when you go to pick the bottle up, spray, etc.  Ive got a feeling that my bottle will receive a little nip/tuck very soon.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is fantastic.  Leather, woody, spice, great longevity.  Not overbearing.</li>
    <li> CH Men is just a perfect perfume for men of style and quality. Get so many compliments and questions as to what i&#x27;m wearing. Lasts all day;get your&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> After countless hours of research in looking for a potential signature scent, i can finally say that i have found it. This is truly a hidden gem in the cologne world, and has gotten me countless compliments in the few times that i have worn it. I am a very picky about scents and have been looking for signature scent that is very versatile and this is it. Will definitely purchase again!!! BTW best blind buy i have ever done.</li>
    <li> the cologne was not what i expected</li>
    <li> Just perfect, its all what i been looking for thats my favorite! I like it, nice price! Nice service! Nice parfum!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother and he loved it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great fake! Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original.</li>
    <li> Received on time expected and brand new as described it.</li>
    <li> Nice and durable fragance. Unfortunately it´s going to run out some day, but is one of the most delicious perfumes i ever had.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance! Shipped fast and at a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using  CH men for a while now i love the smell is not to strong but not to fruity it smells good and girls like it :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Excelente producto y y excelente servicio. Muy rápida la entrega, en tiempo récord. Lo recomiendo. El producto llego en excelente condiciones.</li>
    <li> Good product; Not too sweet; gotten some good comments..</li>
    <li> Excellent price and excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> I recommend you don&#x27;t blind buy this. Try it out first and see what you think . Yes it has many great reviews here and you tube, but it is very weak to me and doesn&#x27;t last very long on my skin. Maybe about 2 hours for me. I guess I had very high expectations. Remember that you cannot return perfumes !!! I will continue to use it in my rotation or maybe for work</li>
    <li> Overall it is a very nice cologne. It is masculine and sweet at the same time. However, it is not a compliment getter as how everyone states it is. So far its been a month and I only got two compliments. I work in a store so I deal with hundreds of people on a daily basis. However, zero compliments. The longevity of the cologne is horrible. I feel as if the cologne&#x27;s smell wears off within five minutes. Unless you are planning on showering with this cologne, although it would not be nasty like other colognes , dont plan on smelling good for a long time. So, either I got a fake or this colognes longevity sucks. Good luck if you plan on buying it. Or buy a couple to refresh it every thirty minutes. In my opinion I would spend the money on a better cologne.</li>
    <li> Smells great. My girlfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> very fast and excellent product, price and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product&lt;br /&gt;I like physically and the price also&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to all</li>
    <li> Smells divine, projects fine for around 2 hours, but after that it becomes a skin scent and needs to be re-applied. Other than that, an excellent cologne, draws many compliments in the first hours of use.</li>
    <li> Very nice manly scent.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GOOD FRAGRANCE TO SETTLE WITH FOR A LONG TIME,I THINK I HAVE FOUND IT IN THIS COLOGNE</li>
    <li> of the best fragrances I&#x27;ve used. It goes great with my ph and lasts almost all day aroma. excellent</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling colognes I have ever owned. If you get a chance to get your hands on this cologne, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Very soft and delicate scent, my husband gets lots of compliments when he wears it.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!! This cologne is absolutely amazing! I went to the local perfumania and asked the gal to &amp;#34;what&#x27;s NOT popular but smells good&amp;#34;? She shows me this and proceeds to tell me it&#x27;s $80. I immediately came on Amazon and found this for $45 and purchased. Everyone asks me what it is and I say nothing!!! I love this cologne and have finally found my &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t want anyone else I know getting this and wearing it. As of now, I am the unique one.</li>
    <li> I find this fragrance very good, but others find this amazing on me so that is why it gets 5 stars. Even when you think its not on you, people will smell it am be pleased. This is a definite crowd pleaser in the fragrance community.</li>
    <li> Excellent i recomend it. It is 100% original Amazon is very responsable. I have boght this fragance 4 times,  the smell is excelent and last a lot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old college student who was just looking for a new fragrance because my current Acqua di Gio is almost empty. I wanted to get something that smells amazing without breaking my bank and this fragrance did it! The shipping was fast and the package was in perfect condition with the perfect amount of packing material. I&#x27;ll edit this review in a few weeks or so to give further updates on it and to let you know if other people love this smell as much as I do! I love Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> He estado usando esta colonia por más de un año y debo decir que ya soy un fanático de ella. Con una esencia masculina y que perdura a l lago del día, esta colonia es un éxito seguro!</li>
    <li> Delivery fast. Good product smells good</li>
    <li> Good product, meets all the expectations of purchase. This light fragrance is very good and lets see when used by me. Recommended!</li>
    <li> El cliente cumplió con la entrega del producto a tiempo, por lo cual he quedado satisfecho para poder optar o tomar en cuenta para una próxima compra. gracias........</li>
    <li> Son originales, de buena calidad ademas el costo me parece justo, lo recomiendo llega en un tiempo justo y biene sellado.</li>
    <li> Okay, it was expected,.  one hundred percent recommended for entire site .  Muy bien  100% recomendable, la vuelvo a comprar si fuere el caso</li>
    <li> Nothing was wrong with the process or vendor. My disatisfaction is with the product itself. CH for men has a light feminine smell to it. My girlfriend said it reminded of the 212 she used to wear, she did not think it was a manly smell. The item was received as advertised and delivery was as expected.</li>
    <li> A++ great soft smell, not overpowering at all and tons of complimants. Awsome cologne at a great price👍👍</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume ever!!, you have to smell one to know what im talking about i really recomend it</li>
    <li> tiene un aroma divino lo recomiendo ampliamente. lo he comprado dos veces y lo seguiría comprando es exquisito le encanto a mi esposo lo compre de regalo de aniversario.</li>
    <li> Perfume recommend it because it is soft and if more comes from Carolina Herrera and even recommend it because the truth Fragrances are these.</li>
