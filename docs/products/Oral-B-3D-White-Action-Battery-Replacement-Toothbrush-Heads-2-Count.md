<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My cross action oral b toothbrush has lasted for years!  This is the most affordable head replacement.  The brush is medium , I would have preferred a soft bristle bush.</li>
    <li> It fits with the toothbrush I have.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find this replacement on Amazon. It is very hard to find. Other models seems to be more common. It helped me to read additional information  that said it specifically fit my battery run toothbrush.</li>
    <li> this is prcisely what I wanted at a very fair price.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy.</li>
    <li> These fit my Oral B Cross Action toothbrush perfectly and are much less expensive than at other stores.  I will be purchasing these again!</li>
    <li> Stiff brush, makes for clean teeth.</li>
    <li> Replacement works very well. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> excellant hope they will always be available</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I expected and what I have purchased in local stores.....just a lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> Wish they were more open about this think being not compatible with regular OralB electrical toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These fit and work great on my Oral-B 3D White Action Power Toothbrush. With the included tool they are very easy to replace.</li>
    <li> As expected and a great price</li>
    <li> I can no longer find these locally.  I am still using a battery powered version of the toothbrush.  Actually, I had one of the rechargeable versions, but the head cracked and could not be glued back together.  No reason to replace the whole body as this old one works just fine.</li>
    <li> They fit and they work.  They seem to be stiffer than what I&#x27;ve been using, but there is no indication on the packaging or on the website as to it&#x27;s stiffness.</li>
    <li> These are great toothbrushes really...</li>
    <li> Can be replaced easily</li>
    <li> Good product as described.</li>
    <li> The Oral B toothbrush is great but by the time they reached me, they were a bit squished in the packaging.</li>
    <li> I just buy this replacement brushes all the time. Easy to replace and last a while.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads cost more than most others and I was going for economy.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon</li>
    <li> Great replacement. The only brush that I have used that does not prick my gums.</li>
    <li> Best deal around! Bought two packs</li>
    <li> Finally found the correct replacement heads for husband&#x27;s toothbrush.  You can count on Amazon for most anything you need.</li>
    <li> I love this product  Once I removed the old toothbrush from the holder the rest was easy.  I recommend anyone who needs to replace their OralB brush.  Get them from this seller</li>
    <li> Have had a hard time finding these in local stores. Just what I have been looking for. Pleased</li>
    <li> Good product as described.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes and brush heads. Issue is with all electric toothbrushes the heads are EXPENSIVE to replace. This is a decent price for the brush heads.</li>
    <li> This type replacement head works well on my toothbrush.  Long lasting.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner... These are a bit of a pain to change but once they are in place you can&#x27;t deny the effect on your mouth</li>
    <li> These are the same toothbrush heads that came with the toothbrush you bought and if you&#x27;re reordering like I did, it must be good. No review needed. Just flash a smile.</li>
    <li> Great stuff worth the money. Good alternatives.</li>
    <li> Great product at an awesome price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get this product in my country.  I have bought this several times already and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> hard to find in the local stores, all different heads but not for our toothbrush  (action) little older, but still working just needed new heads</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I recommend</li>
    <li> My mouth feels so much cleaner using this than a manual toothbrush. It is a little difficult to replace the heads but I&#x27;ve never had problems with them being loose or popping off.</li>
    <li> I have used these battery operated toothbrushes for years and I have found it difficult to find replacement heads in the stores. I am very happy to be able to buy them at a reasonable price online. They work very well to keep teeth clean.</li>
    <li> Great two pack, and decent price. easy to change heads and also lasts awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone who owns a oral b electric brush</li>
    <li> Love the ease of using coupon online got a great deal.</li>
    <li> Its only a replacement head for your oral-B.</li>
    <li> This Oral-B toothbrush has lasted me something like 6 years. The heads are a part of its awesomeness.</li>
    <li> Most toothbrush heads these days are soft or extra-soft, but these heads are just the eentsiest bit firmer, which is what I prefer.  My teeth feel cleaner that way!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and fits well with my oral b cross action toothbrush</li>
    <li> We were glad to find a replacement head for our obselete toothbrushes.  These heads are as good as the ones we used before, and gives us more time before we have to find another toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Good stuff I&#x27;m always purchasing these thru local pharmacy but this time I have desided to buy it thru here and yup it&#x27;s simple way to get you stuff</li>
    <li> Finally found refills to my toothbrush! As expected, works great and came with a tool for easy replacement of the old head.</li>
    <li> works great and easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I love not spending a thousand dollars on a fancy electric toothbrush head that probably doesn&#x27;t do any better than these Oral-Bs. These come with a tool to remove you old head, and the new one slips right on. Feels great on my teeth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my faded blue Cross Action for so long that when I think about it, it&#x27;s kinda gross.  Okay, not really because I&#x27;m constantly buying these replacement toothbrush heads...smart move, Oral-B.  Locked in for years.  The head is same as it&#x27;s always been and with the powerful combo with toothpaste, leaves my teeth sparkly and my mouth all fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of electric toothbrushes since they brush my teeth much better. I can feel the difference since i switch back to the non-electric ones when the electric toothbrush head goes bad. This Oral set is the most reasonably priced out there. Now i&#x27;m always stocked up with these.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush, and it&#x27;s nice that I can order them online inexpensively because it saves me from having to go into a certain big box store that sells everything for less.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are not available in many places. They are the only heads that fit my electric toothbrush. They work really well with different bristles. They are very easy to install..</li>
    <li> Price is great. Other things are all good.</li>
    <li> The top circular part of the brush head consistently breaks and stops vibrating. When it works, it&#x27;s fine, but for me, the heads don&#x27;t last long at all. I upgraded to a circular-only design Oral-B toothbrush. The new brush and brush heads are WAY better than the brush that requires the 3-d white heads.</li>
    <li> as expected - love that i can order it online.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great toothbrush heads, I bought 10 of them when I bought the the electric tooth brush itself so I wouldn&#x27;t have to think about it for awhile. They&#x27;re well made, they brush my teeth, and they&#x27;re affordable. I like having the cleanest teeth possible without spending $200+ on a toothbrush that does the exact same thing.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic heads. Can&#x27;t find them at Target or CVS in my area anymore, presumably because they were so popular that they were cutting into the more expensive electric toothbrushes marketed by these guys.</li>
    <li> I love the battery-powered toothbrush, but the head wore out.  These replacement heads made the brush like new!  In fact, this particular head was better than the original.  Thank you, Oral-B.</li>
    <li> They are the correct replacement heads for my tooth brush.  I had been unable to find any in any store around here.  Very, very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush head, really cleans your teeth and I love the delivery every few months.</li>
    <li> not durable. Lacks quality! In less than week it has lost firmness.</li>
    <li> what&lt;br /&gt;ok so they should&#x27;ve made the directions 200% more clear on how to replace the brush head&lt;br /&gt;i accidently broke the damn toothbrush and wasted this purchase bc the toothbrush broke&lt;br /&gt;i wasted like $6 im going to cry</li>
    <li> I never knew that I can replace the head of my spin brush because it would never come off. The replCement heads comes with a devices that attaches to the brush and makes the replacement heads come off.</li>
    <li> Great product,  being using this toothbrush style for over 8 years</li>
    <li> Made a mistake thinking that it is a replacement for the Oral-B electric toothbrush.  It was for some other type.</li>
    <li> Same as the original that my wife likes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than at the store, and I&#x27;ve had this electric toothbrush for about 10 years and it still works great! (I recommend changing the heads more than once every 10 years though)</li>
    <li> Great and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Toothbrush head is not very soft, two months to replace</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly,  fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> BEST EVER---THANKS AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Great product but we&#x27;ve made the investment in Sonicare products and don;t use these replacement heads anymore. I do recommend their quality from past purchases.</li>
    <li> My regular brand . Oral b dont need a ratting</li>
    <li> These are excellent.  They last me only 2 months because I brush often (4 times a day).  The toothbrush 3D is also great.  the only thing is you have to keep a supply of batteries on hand.  In future, Im thinking of getting the rechargeable toothbrush, but the electric is just fine.</li>
    <li> i had my oral b for a couple of montrhs and then suddenly it would stop brushing swapped out the old head for this and its like my toothbrush is brand new will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does a great job in deep cleaning the teeth. Now, I don&#x27;t have to go to the dentist so much.</li>
    <li> Exatamente o que eu precisava.</li>
    <li> Have not compared to anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about a month and my teeth do feel cleaner after using it. I charged it when I first got it and have yet to charge it again and it&#x27;s working great. My only complaint is that it is very very loud and the way it&#x27;s designed your spit and the toothpaste drips down the handle. Kinda gross to comment about but it&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> Cheap and great product .  Bought it as an add-on item</li>
    <li> Great.  Couldn&#x27;t find these at Walmart which is where I bought the unit.  Would have had to buy another whole unit of some sort if I didn&#x27;t find these.</li>
    <li> 4 stars cause u get board using it after a while</li>
    <li> Fit the toothbrush perfectly and was a great price.</li>
    <li> Do you know how difficult to impossible it is to find replacement heads when your electric toothbrush is old but still perfectly good?  Well, I won&#x27;t have that experience again.  I&#x27;m buying a supply of the heads NOW to avoid trashing a very nice system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love our electric toothbrushes.  I for one can attest to the fact that my gum health is actually improving and I have less plaque when I have my teeth cleaned twice a year.  In fact, at the last cleaning, my hygienist (who has been cleaning my teeth for 30 years) said &amp;#34;if I didn&#x27;t know you, I would think you recently had your teeth professionally cleaned.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Easy to replace - saves money.</li>
    <li> The brushes are durable and well made.</li>
    <li> speedy delivery,  firmer bristles  than original,  after a week they are great</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite toothbrush for a few years counting, and these replacements were perfect!</li>
    <li> So nice to have new bristles.</li>
    <li> I like these. so much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is a great tooth brush, get the brush heads when you buy the brush!  Will save you a lot of headaches down the road .</li>
    <li> Hard to find replacement brushes for this toothbrush. Always nice to have a new one. These are better quality than previous heads. Like the different colors bristles, gives different cleaning action.</li>
    <li> Great replacement item for the electric toothbrush, easy to change and works well, would recommend to anyone who wants a replacement.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It works like it should.</li>
    <li> I really like the Oral-B electric toothbrush I bought years ago.  I like it so much that after I started using it I went back to the store and bought another and a pack of replacement heads. Now I needed more replacement heads and was wondering if the rechargeable battery might be wearing out soon. So went back to the store to buy a back up and they were gone from the shelf - in all the stores I checked! The newer models where different and much more expensive.  Did not look like an improvement either.  So checked with Amazon and sure enough they were still available for purchase.  Yea Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very good and very impressive. I use it every day. it does very clean job especially in the back of the teeth</li>
    <li> softer than I wanted but they work great in my battery brush</li>
    <li> Works with cross action toothbrush</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested I try a fairly cheap Oral-B electric toothbrush and these are the refills for the head it uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist is happy with the results.  I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t compare to some of the really expensive electric tooth brushes, but it does a much better job then an old school manual brush.</li>
    <li> Yes meet My needs anyone that has an oral - b toothbrush all electric or battery powered.This is the replacement brush.</li>
    <li> Been using the (Cross) Action series for years, and absolutely love them.  Leaves a real clean, polished feel on my teeth, and the price is right.</li>
    <li> These are gifts but we use the ourselves.  Make sure you rinse them well after use, and clean the handle often to remove most of the toothpaste buildup.  A gel toothpaste seems to work better.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace, good price after the discount.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. Cleans very well. Stays charged for a long time, at least an hour.</li>
    <li> Jusl like getting a new brusk!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Price was OK.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and value for my old toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Have not used yet. Am sure it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I had been searching for, price was good and received in plenty of time.</li>
    <li> This is a hard-to-find item in local stores.  Convenient purchase.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price.</li>
    <li> was happy to finally find replacement head for this brand tooth brush. quite pleased</li>
    <li> Prices started going up! :(</li>
    <li> I bought these for a different tooth brush, an electric oral b but they didn&#x27;t fit so I bought the tooth brush they did fit and gave it to my grown son who loved it!</li>
    <li> As expected they fit and work properly.</li>
    <li> shipped even to Germany without any troubles. Would always reorder again.</li>
    <li> Cheap and cleans well.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t fit oral b electric toothbrush I ordered and they won&#x27;t take it bacl</li>
    <li> Oral-B makes great toothbrushes, period.  The longevity of their rechargeable 3D White Action is unparalleled.  So you can naturally imagine that I ordered 4 of these replacements heads.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are for an older toothbrush that my brother absolutely loves. That being said, it is tricky finding the replacement heads locally. I was thrilled to find them available on Amazon, and at such a great price. I added them to my subscribe and save and now they get delivered automatically without any fuss. They fit his toothbrush perfectly, are a great deal, and provide a great and thorough cleaning experience.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended - the only toothbrush I use.  Been cavity free for many years!  It must be doing the job correctly.</li>
    <li> Effective brushes. Don&#x27;t last all that long and are quite expensive. Changing the heads is not that easy. I have had several of these brushes but the durability of the battery is poor. I have now purchased a more expensive Deep Sweep 1000 brush and hope for better durability.</li>
    <li> Helps me brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> Brushes are too hard.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my Cross Action Oral B toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in the whiteness of my teeth since using the new head, but I didn&#x27;t expect to.</li>
    <li> Heads are hard to change, but I love the cross action clean.</li>
    <li> This was a nice alternative to putting more trash in a landfill. It works like new and I saved a few bucks over buying a new toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great price on these with subscribe and save, and I can never seem to find these in the store. Fit perfectly with my oral b 3d toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years. For the money, they&#x27;re the best.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush replacement heads. Love this toothbrush and so glad I found a supplier of the heads.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement brush heads. These are better than the Max Clean original heads I had bought with the battery base originally. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> They fit. They work. Hardest part is getting old brushes off.</li>
    <li> good deal would buy again</li>
    <li> These are getting harder to find.  I&#x27;m so glad I found them on Amazon.  They are perfect replacements.  I purchases a couple of them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the toothbrush or the heads, but after 3 months the top portion of the head stopped spinning (even after replacing the battery and the head.)  A total waste of money and a real disappointment.</li>
    <li> No issues for this genuine product, which is must to have if you want to continue using your poweraction device.</li>
    <li> These heads are very easy to install (using the tool that comes with them) and they clean the teeth easily and quickly.</li>
    <li> The head on the Oral-B is much wider than their older models.  Kind of noisy also.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s really great! Match my toothbrush very well. Like it.</li>
    <li> Just so everyone is clear...  These are the heads that fit only on the battery-powered oral-B electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the rechargeable type, these don&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these at the pharmacy any more.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, this is a great toothbrush. My teeth thank me twice a day. What a way to live life.</li>
    <li> exactly what we need. will reorder.</li>
    <li> Glad to get them.  Work great</li>
    <li> Enjoy my Oral B and with these new heads it&#x27;s like having a new machine :-)</li>
    <li> Easy replacement heads, work a treat and extend life of the toothbrush a long time. Cost less than a new non-powered toothbrush.</li>
    <li> fits as expected, and bristles are not too hard or soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller...All very good!!</li>
    <li> Good price for these. Cheaper than Walmart.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Love the toothbrush. Easy to replace the heads.</li>
    <li> Met Expectation. Super Fast Delivery</li>
    <li> We have these on subscription service for every 3 months and it works great! Now we don&#x27;t forget to change them and they&#x27;re cheaper than the store.</li>
    <li> These refills are the same quality as the one the brush came with at a good price.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty difficult to give a review of a toothbrush however without these replacement heads for my electric toothbrush it would be worthless. not much else to offer other than they work fine and not difficult at all to swap out. no complaints</li>
    <li> Good replacement heads for battery operated Oran-B tooth brush. These were in the list of my &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27;  and will shipped automatically  one order for every 6 months.</li>
    <li> Just as expected.  A little difficult to remove but better than buying an a entirely new toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Good product. Much better than a lot of others on the market.</li>
    <li> It working well and come with an handy change tool. Nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> got to have refills,,,, these are ORAL B .. so they fit and work..... never found a 3rd party replacement that was good !</li>
    <li> Love the toothbrush and these are simply the replacement heads.  Very difficult to find in any stores, not to mention, the price if I ever do.  I have naturally white teeth so I can&#x27;t comment on the whitening claims but I do like the fact that these heads last a long time with no fraying.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to the battery operated toothbrushes and diligently change the heads out every 3 months</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Toothbrush head....nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> Our rechargeable &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; toothbrushes are our favorite purchase ever. It is becoming harder to find the replacement heads so I purchased several this round.</li>
    <li> Cheap and work great.  Replacements are a great price compared to more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Great head replacements! It works like the original the toothbrush came with. The replacement toothbrush may be hard to put on/remove at first, but you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Misunderstood description of item. They do not fit on the toothbrush I purchased. The toothbrush I bought recommended these replacement heads so I thought they would fit on it but they do not fit.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush heads-I love them and subscribe and save is so helpful in helping make sure that I change out my heads on time and never have to worry about remembering to buy or change them-Awesome.</li>
    <li> Works just like it is supposed to.  I&#x27;m so glad that they include a tool to remove the old head.  It would be difficult to remove it without the tool.</li>
    <li> I like to change brush heads  after a cold or sore throat, or just in general every couple of months. These fit well, are soft enough to wrap around the teeth and not damage gums. .</li>
    <li> Works just fine.  No problems.</li>
    <li> the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
    <li> power toothbrush is the way to go to make teeth healthier. I would recommend everyone to try cause you will fall in love.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To bad they discontinued them&lt;br /&gt;They clean great and the base lasts for years</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s teeth super clean and mouth really fresh. It seems to be a very good deal on here so I recommend purchasing on Amazon</li>
    <li> Thought these were gone forever as I haven&#x27;t been able to find locally. Happy to find them.</li>
    <li> direct replacement part for new t - b , i&#x27;m sure they will hold up as expected &amp; perform well</li>
    <li> Thank you for easy access to products. With lots of snow on the ground glad I can shop at home!!</li>
    <li> I haven/t used it yet, but the toothbrush is great!</li>
    <li> It is High Cost-Effective</li>
    <li> Snatched these up while they were on sale. Although it takes a few minutes to get used to snapping the heads off with the applicator, these are great replacement heads for the toothbrush they were intended for. At first, I got scared of snapping the heads off because it seemed like they were prone to breakage, but they&#x27;re actually tough. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have the Oral-B Cross Action rechargeable brush that has been discontinued. These fit that model also.</li>
    <li> look close it does not fit the oral b that has been around for years.  It fits some kind of new battery run oral b.  Never got to try the brush since it will not fit my oral b.</li>
    <li> Great to be able to get them on the auto delivery and they do a great job cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> Work good, not great, but good.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT BUY THAT I RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE DENTIST OFTEN!</li>
    <li> Fits my Oral-B 3D White toothbrush. In comparison to other fancy (read: Expensive) power toothbrushes, this one has cost me less than 50 bucks (toothbrush + head replacements for over a year) and is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pointing out the obvious, but subscribe and save saves you an additional 5%, 15% if you subscribe to 5 or more items. Due to it being so cheap, it also makes a great filler item if you need to hit that 5 item monthly mark.</li>
    <li> Overpriced.  Hard to open.  Buy a generic instead.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are hard to find. Glad Amazon had them. A little pricy but they are what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is another Christmas present, that goes with the electric toothbrush. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These work great.  I would like it if they lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Love these toothbrushes. I have one and my daughter has one (6 year old) it wasn&#x27;t to big and we loves how they make our teeth feel!</li>
    <li> Hard to find heads, good price on amazon.  I can&#x27;t go back to normal brushes, at the very least, you can reduce the amount of time you need to brush to feel like your teeth are clean.</li>
    <li> Took forever to find. Glad I did. These are great. Hate they are add on item. Would like to get more. Hope you keep them in stock.</li>
    <li> Fit and good for replaces</li>
    <li> Great price Great item Great delivery</li>
    <li> I wish I had something dramatic to write about these.  I&#x27;ll stick with &#x27;good item&#x27;</li>
    <li> Great replacement heads, they fit perfectly&lt;br /&gt;I can use them for a few months even! (yes I know make sure you replace them often for sanitary reasons!)</li>
    <li> They work fine with the toothbrush but the bristles are pretty stiff; not appropriate for those needing soft bristles because of gum sensitivity.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads from Oral-B are long-lasting and hold up well. I brush my teeth three or four times a day, and I wind up getting a minimum of several weeks of wear with these heads. They&#x27;re also really easy for me to remove (with the little &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; that comes with the 2-pack of heads). And putting the new one in is a snap (pun intended). They fit my trusty battery-powered toothbrush, which is good, since I like the portability of this toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve had it for years. So long as I can keep getting these I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Item came on time.In a very good condition how it was describe. I used this toothbrush head all the time, like this brand.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, wish I didn&#x27;t have to add it on but ehh I needed it. Smart move Amazon, smart move.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time ordering replacement brushes for our Oral B toothbrushes. Great product...hard to find in our area. Replacement is easy. Fine quality brushes. Hope Amazon continues to offer them.</li>
    <li> Cleans your teeth better than regular toothbrush, love it.</li>
    <li> Works well, could probably be cheaper though - with coupon it is around $1.3 per head which is a lot for a piece of plastic (dollar store has 6 brushes for a buck)</li>
    <li> Excellent for my teens</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement heads for my Oral B electric toothbrush</li>
    <li> Cheap, good alternative for expensive sonicair models.</li>
    <li> These are very well made brushes.  For an electric toothbrush, these Oral-B crossaction brushes are factory parts and fit easily on the brush holder.  They look and feel exactly like the original.  They are very reasonably priced.  It comes with the tool to pop out the old brush and the new snaps back in.  If these work as well as Sonicare, its bang for buck as it cost half as much for the brush and the brush holder.</li>
    <li> This was a really good deal. These are usually higher priced, and I always like saving money. They fit my tooth brush. oral b 3733</li>
    <li> Excellent low-price electric toothbrush, especially if you like a larger surface area covered at one time (vs. the little circular ones).</li>
    <li> not so many places carry those replacement heads anymore, so this is good and easy way to stock up on favorite product.</li>
