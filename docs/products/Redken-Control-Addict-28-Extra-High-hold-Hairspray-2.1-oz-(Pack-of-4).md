    <li> very good size to take when traveling, &amp; good hold</li>
    <li> I was shocked as to how well this hairspray works.  Even in windy conditions, your hair will stay perfectly... well.... solid.  The only warning is that if you have dark hair and use too much of the spray, you might get some &amp;#34;white spots&amp;#34; where the spray has dried out.  You can get rid of the spots by spraying it with water.</li>
