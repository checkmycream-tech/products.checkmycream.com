<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not my favorite. Feels like i&#x27;m in a cologne store.</li>
    <li> I like the fragarance, but it is very faint and doesn&#x27;t last. Aside from that the Body Wash is as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a soap that doesn&#x27;t smell like a girl and this definitely fits the bill.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering but it has a wonderful aroma that my wife loves as well.  Being hair challenged I use this everywhere from head to toe and it is wonderful, definitely a nice change from typical drugstore &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; bodywash.</li>
    <li> I first tried the Citrus scent of the same series / brand and I liked it so this time I decided to try the Cedarwood. It smells good. It&#x27;s clear if that matters at all and it does not have the little &amp;#34;awakening rubbing beads&amp;#34; that the citrus scent has. it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin too dry. I would purchase this again after I try the mint one and decide I like this one the most.</li>
    <li> Body wash is a little too lightly scented in my opinion. It does foam up OK, and is not harsh. I would probably purchase again, but would hesitate to recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this body wash but it leaves me feeling like it hasn&#x27;t even removed body oils, and that is a basic thing consumers should expect out of a body cleaning product.  Their mint products smell like milk of magnesia but this one I barely give 3 stars because the smell is nice.</li>
    <li> Smells vaguely woody. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this soap. It smells masculine not to be confused with a 15 year old teenagers idea of &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;. Animal friendly. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper at the store with a target for a logo.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the scent, which isn&#x27;t overpowering.  After showering, I smell clean with only a hint of fragrance.  I like that because I don&#x27;t have to worry about my deodorant, aftershave, and cologne competing with my bodywash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a puff (\\&quot;Manly cleaning device\\&quot; if the word \\&quot;puff\\&quot; intimidates you), it creates the right amount of suds/lather and cleans quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars but the vendor who shipped it sent me a bottle with a damaged cap that was cracked.  I know they were aware of it because they put extra tape to keep the cap from tearing off completely.  The vendor was \\&quot;RED TAG sale\\&quot;.  If I wasn&#x27;t in Afghanistan, I would&#x27;ve sent it back for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would order this again, and probably give it the 5th star, but not from that vendor.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this body wash, and I absolutely love it.  I have always preferred washes that have a lot of scent, and that last for a while after I finish grooming in the morning.  This is one that definitely fits the bill.  Its pleasant smell gives me a very nice wake up call in the morning.  It stays with me for a few hours after I shower, yet it&#x27;s not overpowering.  Its very woodsy and fresh sent doesn&#x27;t smell like a bar of soap.  Its non-greasy formula lathers and rinses very well.  Also, if you prefer \\&quot;green\\&quot; products, this contains all natural ingredients that have not been tested on animals.  I have been sold on it, and don&#x27;t plan on changing brands anytime soon.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.</li>
    <li> I know it is supposed to be a subtle scent, but it is very minor.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and sulfate free!</li>
    <li> Things I liked:&lt;br /&gt;1. Lather. the lather is really nice. A small portion goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I did not like:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smell. There is no smell to this product. I am a scent guy and want to walk out of the shower smelling fresh or in this case with a clean scent of cedarwood. No scent at all. The lather as I mentioned is great, but no smell afterwards. I would stick with Bath and Body works Cedarwood body wash if you want the cedarwood scent. Much better product.&lt;br /&gt;2. The bottle. It is very hard to squeeze the bottle to get the product out of the bottle. You have to be hulk to get it out. The company needs to spend their money on the actaul product versus the bottle. I actually had to squeeze the bottle with my legs to get some out.</li>
    <li> I am solidly hooked on the EMJ product line, and the Cedarwood is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;just a superb product, makes me smell great and my skin feel wonderful.  just a magnificent soap.</li>
    <li> After being really happy with the deodorant of the same scent, I picked up this body wash, and it smells really good. Even one of my buddies  commented on it smelling good haha.</li>
    <li> I use cedar oil in the field to help with insects while prone, this isn&#x27;t cedar, Texas, Virginia, Atlas, Siberian, or other. It&#x27;s not sharp enough for my taste but the wash is very think and lasts for ages.</li>
    <li> Great product, good service!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell until you get it rubbed all over. Smells great then!</li>
    <li> This is perfectly for guys that don&#x27;t like smelling like fresh flowers or some cheap cologne. It didn&#x27;t leave a starting smell after the shower but it left him feeling clean. It was a gift and he loves it!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap, and I love knowing that I&#x27;m not rubbing chemicals and s*** all over my body, so that&#x27;s cool.</li>
    <li> Good body wash but the smell instantly goes away after you shower.</li>
    <li> This is great body wash and it lathers better than anything I have used before. Like the sent too.</li>
    <li> Great body wash, smells really good and is at a great price. Soaps up nicely.</li>
    <li> I picked up a bottle of this at Target on a whim, having been using another (much more expensive) &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; body wash that I also bought on a whim, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the performance.  It has a fresh, manly scent perfect for people who enjoy the smell of a room filled with leather, old books and cigars.  While it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as some other body washes, probably due to the lack of sodium lauryl sulfate (which the bottle makes clear), the price means that a little extra can be included for additional lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good wash since this type of scent seems a little hard to find.  I would definitely buy it again, despite it&#x27;s issues, although I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to another wash with a similar scent but better performance.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells good, but this is NOT Cedarwood!! I was looking for a Cedarwood scented product, but this is not it. Smells clean and lathers good, but the scent is more a Rosemary smell which is not bad, but not what I was expecting by the product NAME. Probably won&#x27;t purchase again because I like the Cedarwood and Sandalwood smells and I am on the search for the ultimate &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> I expected better. Found it for cheaper at a local retailer. I would rather use Dial antibacterial body soap or Dr Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint soap.</li>
    <li> Great body wash. The scent is fantastic, but I wish it was a bit more pronounced.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap since it was in the bar form years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is not for someone who wants to smell like a teen in high school. This soap is for men who do not like using harmful chemicals and cheap essential oil mixtures on their skin. Even the bottle is played down with its reserved colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid itself is rather thick. I use a loofa so it seems to lather pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t have that excessively oily feel like certain cheap soaps. It feels moisturizing but not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is moderate when applying and fades once you rinse. It is almost nonexistent once you are dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this soap is how relaxed I feel after using it and how there is little if any residue, just a feeling of cleanliness.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body wash for a little over a week now. I find that the scent (cedarwood) is barely noticable, even in the shower just after lathering up. The soap seems to clean well but the lack of scent is confusing. Overall I would say that this is a good product but not great. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This mixture is a little too thick for my taste, I&#x27;m used to body wash being fluid, not gelatinous! Also, the smell wasn&#x27;t as bold as I would like it to be.</li>
    <li> Product is as promised. Pleasant smell, nice exfoliating feel.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It lathers MUCH better than expected after trying another product (Tame the Beast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing,  I got cedarwood and it is perfect for men. It is woodsy and not fruity,  and lasts well after the shower. I&#x27;ve used Old Spice washes for awhile and decided to get something different. While those do smell good I wanted to go for something more masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be my wash of choice for awhile. It beats Tame the Beast despite not being for hair. Who cares. If you&#x27;re really concerned about having more than one bottle in the shower that&#x27;s your problem. This wash is excellent and I highly recommend it. I may try the other scents sometime too!</li>
    <li> Get stuff cleans and smells good!</li>
    <li> Since I have developed a pesky case of eczema, I was seeking a body wash that did not contain sodium lauryl sulfate.  I thought I had found precisely what I wanted with Every Man Jack because its blurb says explicitly:  &amp;#34;You Won&#x27;t Find: Sodium lauryl sulfate, parabens, phthalates and dyes.&amp;#34;  Terrific.  Right until it arrived. The first ingredient (after aqua, of course) is:  sodium coco sulfate.  I was not familiar with it, but it sounded closed enough that I looked it up.  Wikipedia says the two are chemically the same, but that the coco version is made from less refined products.  So much for that. It went down the drain where it belonged.</li>
    <li> I purchased one bottle of Cedarwood and one bottle of Signature Mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Cedarwood first, I was expecting a natural woody smell, but its actually more of a sweet/spicy scent, its not bad, and it smells familiar, just not the scent I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Signature Mint later, I was expecting a cool minty chill feeling after showering, I purchased it specifically for the mornings thinking it might help me wake up, but it just isn&#x27;t that powerful, as soon as you&#x27;ve rinsed off it&#x27;s hardly detectable, by the time you&#x27;ve dried off you can&#x27;t hardly smell it on your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (10 months) - After the Cerdarwood and Signature Mint ran out I decided to try the Citrus Scrub. My first impression was much like the other two, the scent was completely different than I guessed, I thought this one would have a strong sharp citrus scent, but really its much more of a sweet mandarin, that doesn&#x27;t mean its bad though, this is my favorite of the three. The only issue I&#x27;ve noticed is that the Citrus Scrub hardens unlike the other two because of the scrub in it, the nozzle always hardens shut and you have to poke something in it, or you&#x27;ll squeeze it and a bunch will blast out at once, wasting a lot. I will be getting more of the Citrus Scrub when it runs out, and maybe another Cedarwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers real well, even if you&#x27;re frugal, each bottle lasted about four months for me.</li>
    <li> Very thick cool gel and keeps my skin moisturized after a shower. I have also the peppermint which is still my favorite and citrus scrub.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It uses great ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Scent is just right, there is no need to be walking around stinking up every room you are in.&lt;br /&gt;Not tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;You can SERIOUSLY get this at half the price elsewhere. The price on here is ridiculous!</li>
    <li> It does its job. It cleans, however the smell is almost non-existent. It&#x27;s a very mild scent, was expecting more of the cedar wood smell from it. Other than that, it&#x27;s another normal body wash.</li>
    <li> Nice body wash.  Leaves the skin feeling clean and smelling good.</li>
    <li> product is very generic smelling and feels like hand soap, says a self proclaimed soap snob</li>
    <li> This is an expensive body wash and unlike Everyman Jack&#x27;s other products, it does meet the mark. Doesn&#x27;t suds-up well, don&#x27;t feel very clean after use, on a white towel cannot see it (clear almost invisible), and doesn&#x27;t matter the scent, can&#x27;t smell it. Nothing special about it Disappointed. Everyman... you can do much better than this.</li>
    <li> I heard about cedar wood soap from a friend and bought some. Its a little pricey but the stuff is all natural and is the perfect scent for a guy that wants to smell good but doesn&#x27;t want to shove it in people&#x27;s faces like the Axe scents do. A very classy and earthy smell.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite body wash, it moisturizes well, feels refreshing and smells great.  Amazon&#x27;s price, at least when I bought it, is quite a bit lower than target&#x27;s as well.</li>
    <li> It’s a gamble trying new products online. Especially those that come in black bottles with minimal design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worry not, this is the good stuff. Nowadays, most bath products for men have a smell marketed as manly, but it’s really the furthest thing from manliness. While the scent doesn’t remind me of fresh cut cedar logs, that’s not the worst thing. The scent isn’t oppressive or overpowering. It doesn’t nauseate or make you feel like you belong on the set of Jersey Shore. It’s a mellow scent. The Every Man Jack Cedarwood body wash also doesn’t irritate my skin like some washes in the past have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feat I’ve encountered, and not just this product of theirs either, is that a little goes a long way. It lathers up great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve bought this twice now, and will again soon when I need to.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of body was over the years.  First impressions for this was that it did not have much scent.  I want a good solid fragrance, not one that burns your eyes, but one you can smell without having to rub the stuff inside your nose.  This product comes close to the second scenario.  Very light scent, but nice.  It takes a tad more than I expected to get a good foam, but the lather is very nice and luxurious.  I compare this to triple milled soap, which is all I use, and equally fine products for men.  After not throwing it away due to lack of much scent and wondering just how much I needed on my top quality wash mitt, I found that I like the item.  I still will shop around to find that perfect scent to lather ratio product, but until then, this is my stuff I think.  Liquid is crystal clear from what I can tell as well.  Lid does not pop open and bottle is durable.  Dropped in the shower and it did not break as others have.  Easy to grip container also.  Like a large flask of whisky, just not as tasty.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great. My wife appreciates it too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is flat out amazing. Defines &amp;#34;man&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I was doing some research on the &amp;#34;best men&#x27;s body wash&amp;#34; and this was on several lists. It was only $6 or $7. I tried it once and it is a really nice body wash but I have found another wash that I think I will use forever. It is an awesome wash by Jack Black. It is the Turbo Wash. But, this review is not for that. Overall, this is a really great wash for every day use.</li>
    <li> Great scent, great ingredients.</li>
    <li> Scent is very weak . Not worth price</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for any guy who likes to smell earthy, not perfumey! Has cool name and packaging too. I like to keep a bottle in guest bath and I am usually asked where I bought it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> little pricey but nice</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. Lathers real nicely. I&#x27;ve had it for 4 months and i still have a lot left.</li>
    <li> Good product, dries skin out a bit.</li>
    <li> Decent prodcut.  Not an overwhelming smell, and, will last you a couple of months depending on how you use it.  I like the feel, cleanliness, and smell of it over the cliche&#x27; big brand (Axe, Oldspice, etc) body-washes that are out there.  Overall good product and good value.</li>
    <li> Nice scent small bottle wish it came in bigger size.</li>
    <li> Nice for showering and washing hands at the sink. I&#x27;m planning to buy a couple more bottles so I can distribute them upstairs and downstairs.</li>
    <li> This soap smells like wood. I love the smell of wood. There are few things more pleasurable in the morning that taking a shower surrounded by the smell of wood. On top of that, this soap does a great job of cleaning my skin, which is something I need while taking a shower that smells like wood.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing.  Subtle, total manly scent.  They changed the design of the bottles, though, and it makes it much harder to use.  It&#x27;s so thick that you only need to use a little, which is nice, but that also makes it somewhat hard to squeeze out.</li>
    <li> Wonderful it smells nice and leaves your skin moist.</li>
    <li> Doubly disappointed. Not only did this arrive with a broken cap that enabled the contents to spill into the padded envelope, but it smells nothing like cedar or even wood for that matter. The scent is reminiscent of sports scented deodorants- not very natural at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the citrus scented body scrub from Every Man Jack and I have to say I prefer this one more. The smell is a bit more masculine. Also it lathers generously with a good body sponge/ scrubber.</li>
    <li> Thick and doesn&#x27;t leave scent behind. It&#x27;s hard to get out of the container and it is very lightly scented</li>
    <li> Great product, but overpriced. you can find locally for much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I like this as soap but the smell was disappointing.  I expected it to have the aroma of a sauna but it just faintly smells like cedar, if you think about it.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells great . Just ordered two more .</li>
    <li> I will say this does not have all the harsh chemicals that body washes like axe, old spice, dial and other ones like that.  It is good and leaves me feeling refreshed.  The only complaint that I have is it is a little costly and the smell is not the strongest.  While the smell is fresh and natural it is not strong and does not stay for very long.  This body wash though does refresh and clean well though.</li>
    <li> Every Man Jack is great stuff. The best Mens Body Wash out there. Highly recommend.  A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Lathery. That&#x27;s about it - the scent barely stays and is not pungent. Even grabbed a bottle at Target for half the cost with the same result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Every Man Jack products for over a year now - body wash, shaving cream, shampoo, etc. I like&#x27;em all.</li>
    <li> I love it! Nice scent also!</li>
    <li> Love it. Perfect subtle smell. Only complain is that it seems to be really thick compared to other shower gels I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> My boys love this, and I love that they don&#x27;t smell like deodorant.  The scent is wonderful and not artificial at all.</li>
    <li> I do really like the muted scent on this one.  Its fresh and masculine without being overpowering.  Its meant for adults that aren&#x27;t attracted to the beer drinking football watching marketing that seems to dominate our products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and also,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5 at Target.  Just Sayin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whats that I saved you 50%, Your Welcome.</li>
    <li> After trying the citrus Every Man Jack I was disappointed. It does not lather near as much and requires more on your washrag.</li>
    <li> To preface this story, I have to use allergy free laundry detergent otherwise my body reacts in a negative fashion.  So in short, I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Man Jack&#x27;s body wash is completely easy on the skin &amp; my skin has no problem with it.  My only problem is the lack of aroma.  I am not one of those men that over power themselves with cologne.  I spray a mist and I walk into the mist, so I do not blast myself directly.  I enjoy light smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is too light.  I am not sure if it this Cedarwood but I don&#x27;t want to risk it considering the price of the bottle.  Going back to Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> I found this stuff a year or more ago at target and loved it, then they stopped carrying it and when i found it online, the price had tripled, and the package size had reduced by 25%!  I stayed away from it for a while, and then saw the price had gone down (some but not all the way) and the package size was returned to the original, so i bought some more.  The bottle I  received has a noticable thicker consistency, as well as a much less noticable smell, like the essential oils are greatly diluted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was like it used to be but I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great body wash. Cleans, smells great and just does the job. I work out a lot. I&#x27;m a gym rat that works out 5-6 days a week. I do kick boxing 3-4 times a week so I sweat, A LOT. Only 2 brands of soap could get me cleaned before. It was Dial for Men and Nivea for Men. Although these 2 brands can keep my skin feeling clean, the problem is that they don&#x27;t create much lather. Ever Man Jack gives me the same clean feeling and it creates a lot of lather with just a tiny amount so I don&#x27;t have to squeeze too much out. Think I will switch over to this brand for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a lot cheaper at Target, almost half off. I just bought 2 bottles at target for 4.99 each compared to almost 9 bucks here.</li>
    <li> Lather is amazing, but i was somewhat disappointed by the scent.  I was expecting Cedar but it is so faint I can barely tell</li>
    <li> One of the things this brand prides itself on is not containing sodium lauryl sulfate. Instead it contains sodium coco sulfate, which is near identical in function and effect. Disingenuous to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells good, and works well otherwise but shady marketing is shady.</li>
    <li> this is a good product with good ingrediants. I would recommend it to the health conscious consumer, smells great too!</li>
    <li> Barely has any scent. Was hoping for something more. I don&#x27;t feel like a lumberjack after using this. Won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband he smells great after his shower. Lathers great and the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming. Will get again</li>
    <li> smells good, clear liquid, easy to put on scrunchy or rag</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t smell it after you wash it off but it lathers up quite nicely.</li>
    <li> For any dudes who want to differentiate and stray away from the Old Spices, Axes, and Dove Men&#x27;s of the world: Go with every man jack. I was very excited when I saw that this was being offered on Amazon Prime, and jumped on it immediately. I&#x27;ve had this bottle since the beginning of the semester, and when coupled together with a shower tool (this can be an Axe product) this bottle can go a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use cologne. This is as close to a scented product I will use, besides deodorant. Smells great, and I would assume it does well as far as the cleaning department goes. Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from the ladies. Then again, I haven&#x27;t really heard any compliments either. All good things. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The scent smells good out of the bottle but on your skin it is a little too weak for me.</li>
    <li> The product smells good, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last after the shower. There is a slight warm feeling when applying the product which feels really good for cold days. But other than that it is overpriced!</li>
    <li> Smells great lasts a long time. Subtle, manly.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on Amazon before purchasing this body wash and I was lead in the right direction. I use typically Dove for Men and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it, however I wanted to switch to something with a little less chemicals. This product has no sulfates, parabens and other chemicals. I don&#x27;t go overboard with these types of things but I figure the less chemicals I put on or in the body the better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, has nice smell, nothing overpowering. The value isn&#x27;t great but I&#x27;ve paid more for less. It lathers nicely and has plenty of oils in it. Would consider buying again. Maybe. EHH</li>
    <li> This product is great! It smells amazing, you really feel like a man using it. A little goes a long way as well - makes a great lather. Love this body wash.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and packaging was very good as usual from amazon.  This product has a little less un-natural ingredients to be absorbed into the body as most of the main stream brands and it has a manly smell.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. Bought it for Cedar Oil STANK cleansing power. Smells good, but isn&#x27;t the diesel soap scrub I need to not STANK. You can add Cedar Oil and combat the STANK for way cheaper.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not have all those bad things in it.  It is a much more natural product.  Sometimes it is not just what you put in your body but what you put on it also.  Not an overpowering smell but a clean one.</li>
    <li> Read about this stuff on GearJunkie and was excited - B&amp;BW recently discontinued my preferred body wash and I was in the market for an alternative. I&#x27;m a big fan of woodsy scents, cedar especially so I picked this up. Holy moley, I&#x27;m so underwhelmed. It has almost NO scent at all! might as well just wash with some basic SoftSoap. Snoooooore :(</li>
    <li> Yeah, it doesn&#x27;t have the most powerful smell... because it isn&#x27;t full of crap that will harm your body over time.  I&#x27;m not some guy that&#x27;s all, &amp;#34;Hey maaan, be good to the Earth and your body maaan...&amp;#34; But seriously, if you want to smell like a minty man-whore go bathe in some mint leaves.  If you think more smells on your sack is going to get you ladies, get some Axe and spritz away.  If you want to help yourself not get cancer down the road, this is where it&#x27;s at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW... it&#x27;s only $4.98 at most Target stores for 16.9 ounces.  Boom1  You just Geico&#x27;d your body.  #mindblown #mintysack #lol #hashtag</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a morning person. I tend to rise naturally without need for an alarm and I&#x27;m at full energy within just a few minutes. Why is this relevant? Well, I don&#x27;t need a uber-scented bodywash to wake my ass up. The cedarwood scent is pretty mild and I find it goes with my deodorant (Safeguard) extremely well. The one thing I hate the most is too many scents. Body-wash + Deodorant + Cologne? No thank you. The EMJ cedarwood has just enough scent to get a good, mild but distinguished body scent, while not overpowering too much for those that like to wear scented deodorants such as Old Spice or colognes. Other pros: slim bottle, stays on the bath shelf better; and, it foams really, really well. Cons: priced at a bit more than I&#x27;d like to shell out for body-wash, but its worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best body wash I&#x27;ve tried.  Looked a long time for a safe, phthalate-free product that smelled nice, lathered well, but was not overpowering.  This is the one.  Try it... you&#x27;ll like it.  It&#x27;s available at Whole Foods and other quality stores.</li>
    <li> Good product, but a bar of soap is the same at less cost....</li>
    <li> My husband loves this smell....so do i...it is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;BUT...it is llight and fades quickly....not like this is a perfume but i would have love a more lasting smell.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the only thing i can bring myself to buy,  its smells great and has micromagnets in it that only attract high class loose women.</li>
    <li> I love the wood scent. By far the manliest shower wash I&#x27;ve ever smelled. It&#x27;s very subtle, which is also a huge plus.</li>
    <li> Love the flavor along with the bottle - satisfies my inner hipster.</li>
    <li> Feels clean! It could smell a bit stronger for my personal taste. But it&#x27;s good stuff. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> It smells great and it&#x27;s a better value than others, but I still think it&#x27;s overpriced for what you get. The bottle is pretty decently sized, but would I or anyone else be able to tell the difference if I bought a $2 bottle of Suave? Probably not.</li>
    <li> great smell, doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry or too oily....lathers nicely and very inexpensive for the quality....Ive tried 25+ different body washes and this one is my favorite....will use this for the rest of my life</li>
    <li> I like that you don&#x27;t have to use too much for a good cleaning lather. The scent is manly but doesn&#x27;t stay with you after you dry off. I might try a different scent next time</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.  I rated it as a 5 star because this product works.  Thank you for offering it.</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash that I&#x27;ve every used.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but it feels great, forms a thick lather with a small dab, smells manly but not overpowering, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  It&#x27;s also made with top notch, naturals ingredients.</li>
    <li> This was really thick like jelly and hard to work with.  It had no smell to it.  I&#x27;ve gotten better results with just plain ole Dial and water.  Not really happy.</li>
    <li> I use cedarwood soap when home but find liquid bodywash to be more convenient for travel. That&#x27;s what I use this for and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Smell is good and it works well.</li>
    <li> Nice smell though not very lasting. Lathers well.</li>
    <li> Nice light fragrance, made in USA</li>
    <li> Smells nice and has fewer chemicals but it doesn&#x27;t sud up that much and is very expensive. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a quest to find a body wash to replace the now-ruined Neutrogena Rainbath. This isn&#x27;t a terrible product, but it&#x27;s not extraordinary either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;It has a thick not-runny consistency.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers easily and well.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans well and rinses easily too.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant, vaguely woodsy scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any dyes in it (some people care about this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not-pros:&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is an annoyance. It&#x27;s a typical plastic bottle with a flip-top lid.&lt;br /&gt;This product is begging for a pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;Since the soap is thick, it is difficult to get out of the bottle after it&#x27;s half-used up. You will have to find a way to invert the bottle. But make sure the cap is tight, because ...&lt;br /&gt;The product leaks out of the bottle during travel and if you turn the bottle over without closing the cap firmly.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is virtually gone as soon as you&#x27;re dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m okay with it. But this stuff is like dating somebody until you can find something better.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Smelled like I had BO all day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love EMJ products, a very rugged and &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell but not overbearing. Works a great lather and washes off cleanly leaving my skin fresh and not itchy.</li>
    <li> free of alot of the harmful chemicals that most male cleansers have. smells nice but not over powering. not like when someone used axe or some similar product and your whole house reaks. this is nice an pleasent</li>
    <li> Great product BUT it leaked out when shipped out!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! I already made two separate orders of this and plan to keep using it. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Best scented body wash a man can use!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now. Its not necessarily bad, but the smell is too subtle for body was and isn&#x27;t really noticeable except when applying it.  I&#x27;ve used other products of Every Man Jack and have enjoyed them, specifically the citrus body wash (which I recommend instead of this one).</li>
    <li> My fav body wash replaced Axe for this stuff.</li>
    <li> Awesome body wash.  Perfect consistency and lather.  Good scent.</li>
    <li> Love the smokey cedar smell. I looked it up and haven&#x27;t bought this in a year (and yes, I use it everyday). My only wish is that it had some sandalwood essence in it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and lather of this body wash. This is unlike any other body wash from your usual ones you get from Walmart or Target, it&#x27;s unique, lathers quite well, and well worth money spent.</li>
    <li> This is the only bodywash I use now!  I buy it from here every time I run out.</li>
    <li> Well this is my first try of Every Man Jack products but I think this product has sealed its future use with me.  The soap is much different from all the others, It is very thick so it doesn&#x27;t run out of your hand quickly,  It lathers better than any other body wash I have used, and the smell is great but not overpowering! GRADE A! Can&#x27;t wait to try more of these products!</li>
</ol>
