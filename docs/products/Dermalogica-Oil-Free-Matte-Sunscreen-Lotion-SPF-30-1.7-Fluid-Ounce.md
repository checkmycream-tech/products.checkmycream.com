      <li>I love the smell and texture of this product.  </li>
      <li>just wished there was more of it, since the price is not that cheap.</li>
      <li>This is not greasy or sticky-It goes on like butter and really works in strong sun!!</li>
      <li>Although it goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen smell, I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
      <li>Great product with no residue, shine or white shade from the SPF.</li>
      <li>it helps keep the oil at bay longer than the Oil Free Matte Block.</li>
      <li>light and oil free.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you struggle with acne-prone skin, try this out as it has never disappointed me with breakouts.</li>
      <li>Feels rich, and absorbs quickly when applied.</li>
      <li>They said SPF 50 does not protects you that much and just had more chemicals in it....</li>
      <li>This is the only sun block that feels good on my skin, doesn&#x27;t add oil, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after application.</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say is that the product does appear to work as a sunblock.</li>

      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and prone to breaking out very easily.</li>
      <li>The letters on the bottle just rubbed right off.</li>
      <li>And on top of that, I broke out the next day in the areas where I&#x27;d applied this lotion.</li>
      <li>Easy to wear daily.</li>
      <li>This works really well under powder make up (I use Jane Iredale SPF powder foundation) and somehow allows your skin to breathe.</li>
      <li>What really upset me was the \\&quot;matte\\&quot; hype -</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist highly recommends this line and product.  </li>
      <li>I live in a sunny, high altitude area and have to have sunscreen on my face every day.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the spf version for a few years and I was glad to see a new spf 30 version.  </li>
      <li>I live all dermalogica products.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and really didn&#x27;t moisturise - but i use this daily.  </li>
      <li>The only warning is that if you are not a very oily skin type, this product will over dry your skin and therefore your skin will overcompensate by producing more oil.</li>
      <li>It goes on white, but after blending is clear and leaves no oily residue.</li>
      <li>my face was definitely oilier than with other sunblocks, much oilier.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great kinda pricey but worth it</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Great product</li>
    <li> I have other dermalogica products and  this one seemed different. The letters on the bottle just rubbed right off. So I could not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is fake don&#x27;t buy, you can see in the photo that i have attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the number on the box 101709-02 and on the bottle is 101709-03</li>
    <li> I usually purchase the SPF 20, but decided it was time to increase my SPF to 30 since I&#x27;m turning 40 this year. I made through the summer without any signs of facial peeling and I spent a lot of time at the beach. It goes on white, but after blending is clear and leaves no oily residue. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> it does not really maintain a non-shine matte finish on my face but it&#x27;s not greasy as I have oily skin. Feels rich, and absorbs quickly when applied. I like that it squeezes out of bottle so you don&#x27;t have to dip your fingers into the product.</li>
    <li> We have melanoma that runs in the family-It&#x27;s so important to protect your face! This is not greasy or sticky-It goes on like butter and really works in strong sun!!</li>
    <li> I live in a sunny, high altitude area and have to have sunscreen on my face every day.  I like this product because my skin won&#x27;t break out....I had problems with other products.  A dermatologist once told me to stick with SPF 30.  They said SPF 50 does not protects you that much and just had more chemicals in it....I have had no issues with my face being burned when wearing this product. I am loyal to this product, it works, so why experiment with others?</li>
    <li> My dermatologist highly recommends this line and product.  I have been using it for the past few months with no complaints.</li>
    <li> The product is not &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; as advertised. My face has a shine after I use it. Although it goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen smell, I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Only downside is the product is getting the product out of the container- ort of like getting ketchup out of a bottle!</li>
    <li> Perfect all around daily sun protection and oil control</li>
    <li> Great product for oily and acne prone skin. I highly recommend it. Spf is a plus. I live all dermalogica products.</li>
    <li> Great product with no residue, shine or white shade from the SPF.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and texture of this product.  It&#x27;s not a traditional greasy feeling sunscreen. The chemical sunscreen ingredients assure that there won&#x27;t be any white or grey cast after application. The only warning is that if you are not a very oily skin type, this product will over dry your skin and therefore your skin will overcompensate by producing more oil. I&#x27;ve discovered I&#x27;m only slightly oily so I switched to a lighter sunscreen and it helps keep the oil at bay longer than the Oil Free Matte Block.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to wear daily. It&#x27;s dumb that I have to write 14 wors on here. Blah blah blah</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of creams and products for my oily/acne prone skin and this is one of the best products out there. My skin is sensitive and prone to breaking out very easily. I&#x27;ll notice a breakout if I try straying away from this. This works really well under powder make up (I use Jane Iredale SPF powder foundation) and somehow allows your skin to breathe. My face however still gets oily but this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t block my pores - I just use face blotting sheets. I&#x27;m very up to date on what&#x27;s out on the green beauty market but I have not found anything that works this good for my skin type. I&#x27;ve tried MyChelle sunscreens and Andalou Oil-Free beauty balm SPF, and unfortunately they don&#x27;t come close to the quality of this product. It&#x27;s a small bottle but it lasts me over 6 months. If you struggle with acne-prone skin, try this out as it has never disappointed me with breakouts.</li>
    <li> Very good coverage, does not clog pores, good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin and or acne. This is the product that you want for daly use, matte finish is great. 30 SPF is perfect.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is amazing. light and oil free.&lt;br /&gt;I just wished there was more of it, since the price is not that cheap.</li>
    <li> This is the only sun block that feels good on my skin, doesn&#x27;t add oil, and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after application.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunblock because it was hyped as being \\&quot;matte\\&quot; and supposedly would not cause breakouts. I have oily skin and have yet to find a sunblock that does not cause breakouts, and this product was no different from any other. What really upset me was the \\&quot;matte\\&quot; hype - my face was definitely oilier than with other sunblocks, much oilier. It was kind of disgusting, and I had to wipe my face repeatedly throughout the day. And on top of that, I broke out the next day in the areas where I&#x27;d applied this lotion. The only good thing I can say is that the product does appear to work as a sunblock. However, it was a complete and utter disappointment on all other counts. If you have oily skin and are prone to breakouts from sunblock, do NOT use this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the spf version for a few years and I was glad to see a new spf 30 version.  It is a little thicker but goes on well no shin and keeps the shin to minimum for hours.</li>
    <li> One of the best sunscreens I have used and I&#x27;ve used a lot. Great under makeup and does not cause my skin to become shiny.</li>
    <li> Always a good choice. Can&#x27;t go wrong withD.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and really didn&#x27;t moisturise - but i use this daily.  Doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Satisfied</li>
    <li> A sunscreen that works, I can wear under make up and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out or get shiny?! What is this magical stuff and where has it been all my life!</li>
