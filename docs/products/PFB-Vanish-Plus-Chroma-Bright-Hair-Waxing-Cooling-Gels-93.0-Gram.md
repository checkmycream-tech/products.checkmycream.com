      <li>I really love this product , it works.</li>
      <li>It works like magic.</li>
      <li>After more than a year of waxing, I started getting a lot of ingrown hairs (and those were leaving some scars), so I decided to change up the after wax treatment I was using and try PFB.</li>
      <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t hesitate purchasing forget the shoes and bags</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say it lightened my existing darkening or scars, but it has prevented more ingrowns.</li>

      <li>I am so grateful for PFB vanish :)</li>
      <li>More perfumey than anything.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>the most stubborn of the set didn&#x27;t come out until the end of week 2.</li>
      <li>Bump Zapper worked, but had too many products to use in order to achieve the desired goal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
      <li>Love the roll on application too, makes it easy and convenient.</li>
      <li>I was delighted that it worked very quickly (in about two weeks) and eliminated all the ingrown hairs and really lightened almost all the scarring.</li>
      <li>but I love PFB Vanish in the original version too.  </li>
      <li>PFB+Chromabright is all I need in one easy roll on.</li>
      <li>Easy to use roller ball and no yucky smell.</li>
      <li>its pretty much alcohol lol</li>
      <li>Use daily and consistently for best results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in coloration.</li>
      <li>(my skin is light anyway), but when it comes to preventing ingrown hairs, it works.</li>
      <li>That is why I had to see if it was available on line.</li>
      <li>far I have been using PFB Vanish plus Chroma Bright for 3 weeks</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over two months, but have not noticed any significant change to my skin.</li>
      <li>Worth the buy!</li>
      <li>Also useful for mens razor burn and ingrown hairs!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s quite pleasant actually, especially compared to the original formula&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>really fast got to admit I love it them</li>
      <li>Safe to use pretty much anywhere</li>
      <li>The item is pricey, but I would say it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>but like anything in life the wait is well worth it.</li>
      <li>I really love this product and I&#x27;m liking the results thus far.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have much success with waxing</li>
      <li>This really works for me, I have seen a significant improvement in in-growns in my bikini area.</li>
      <li>, I put this on right before I walk out the door to get my wax...</li>
      <li>other then that so far so good!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was expecting to get and I received it very fast too.  </li>
      <li>and I still have quite a bit more product left.</li>
      <li>Definitely gonna buy more when I run out.</li>
      <li>but if you are using after a &amp;#34;Brazilian style wax&amp;#34; wait at least 24hrs after wax and try to keep it away from the &amp;#34; opening&amp;#34; for lack of a more publicly acceptable term lol</li>
      <li>I have my clients use this before they come in for a wax and their hair comes out much easier!  </li>
      <li>I finally feel confident with my body again.</li>
      <li>I saw improvements within the first week or so.</li>
      <li>There is a peeling process with this product, so you have to remain consistent with using it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect results after the first couple times of using it, it takes about 3 weeks to 1 month to see a difference</li>
      <li>It does have a faint odor that stays around all day, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>This is my first time using this.</li>
      <li>Always fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a couple weeks and it has really lightened my razor bump scars.</li>
      <li>Dont know that I have notice much of a difference on the skin brightening</li>
      <li>I went out to purchase this because she raved about how much it worked for her.</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>This stuff works so fast.</li>
      <li>This does as it clames and has made my life of shaving sooo much easier.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very prone to ingrown hairs, every time I get a wax it doesn&#x27;t matter how much I exfoliate</li>
      <li>Havent seen much of a difference.</li>
      <li>real, help for ingrowns</li>
      <li>They left very bright red spots on me down there which stayed for MONTHS.</li>
      <li>Take care of ingrowns better than other items.</li>
      <li>Plus Chromabright a try and religiously used it every day and night for two months to verify for myself if the results spoken of in their official website were true.</li>
      <li>Was purchased as a gift and this present recipient was happy and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product if you wax, shave or get ingrown hair follicles.</li>
      <li>but it will take a little more time before I see the results I am seeking.</li>
      <li>You get a good amount of product and a little seems to go a long way.</li>
      <li>So far this product has been working really well.</li>
      <li>but it is normal</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the normal PFB Vanish *without* the chromabright for my ingrown hairs for years...</li>
      <li>I love this product and I use it everyday.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worked in terms of preventing new bumps, but has not helped too much treat existing ones or to fade old scars.</li>
      <li>This was definitely not the right product for me.</li>
      <li>I first bought PFB Vanish (the classic version) to diminish the ingrown hairs I would develop after shaving my private areas.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin is very grateful for this product, my neck above all.</li>
    <li> I ordered this two years ago and I still use it every other night!  I use it for my underarms and bikini area after I shave or wax to prevent ingrown hairs.  I had ingrown hair problems for a while, but this stopped them.  Not sure if it has lightened my skin (my skin is light anyway), but when it comes to preventing ingrown hairs, it works. Definitely gonna buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I like this product at least it does what it promises</li>
    <li> Still waiting on results.</li>
    <li> Ive only been using this a few days and already can see s difference, it is a little pricey though so I plan on switching to regular pfb vanish without chromabright after getting rid of all the dark marks</li>
    <li> Love this product best out there by far. Highly recommend. I use to wax but now I&#x27;m shaving b/c I&#x27;m getting laser hair removal and it helps tremendously!!!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I really love this product and I&#x27;m liking the results thus far.</li>
    <li> I think my skin is improving but it will take a little more time before I see the results I am seeking. Hopefully, by the time I finish the bottle all the old ingrown hairs will be eliminated.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product via YouTube from Jackie Aina. I went out to purchase this because she raved about how much it worked for her. I saw improvements within the first week or so. There is a peeling process with this product, so you have to remain consistent with using it. I wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the results weren&#x27;t amazing to that extent. The results are good and you will see changes over time. I would recommend this for women of color. The item is pricey, but I would say it is worth the money. You get a good amount of product and a little seems to go a long way. I&#x27;ve been heavy handed while using mine and I still have quite a bit more product left. I will repurchase this again, unless something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I really love this product , it works. I have stuffer from ingrown hairs for years and dark spots. This product let the hairs come out. I have only been using it for a week and have seen result already.</li>
    <li> Dont know that I have notice much of a difference on the skin brightening but I love PFB Vanish in the original version too.  I have noticed that the PFB with chromabright seems to leave me a little sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an Esthetician for 9 years and this is by far the best ingrown hair remedy I&#x27;ve found!  Plus it helps lighten dark spots, such a bonus!  I have my clients use this before they come in for a wax and their hair comes out much easier!  There is a noticeable difference.  Highly recommend this product if you wax, shave or get ingrown hair follicles. Note that it will dry your skin out a little, so I use this product (and let it completely soak in) then go back later and moisturize with lotion.  Love the roll on application too, makes it easy and convenient.</li>
    <li> I will definitely update when I finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have been using PFB Vanish plus Chroma Bright for 3 weeks and I must say, I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;ve never gone this long without a new ingrown. when I started using the product (under arms and in bikini area) i had several stubborn ingrowns that were inflammed so much i couldn&#x27;t get to the hair. After using this product for a week, the dead skin cells were removed (that&#x27;s the peeling everyone mentioned) and the hairs were within reach. the most stubborn of the set didn&#x27;t come out until the end of week 2. now that it&#x27;s gone, i can HONESTLY say, I have not experienced any new ingrowns yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this isn&#x27;t one of those products that stops working over time. The excessive peeling is gone. now the peeling is barely little to none. hopefully i can come back in a few months and say the product is still going strong.</li>
    <li> Really works ... great product</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was expecting to get and I received it very fast too.  Definitely recommend you get this from this vendor if you&#x27;re in cali.</li>
    <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t hesitate purchasing forget the shoes and bags this have been my best purchase yet skiinn already clearing it has been 3 weeks I wear it day and night skin peeling can be a bit aggy but if it&#x27;s not peeling it&#x27;s not clearing!!!</li>
    <li> It works really well and I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything to get rid of ingrown hairs. It really does help to diminish the sight of past bumps too.</li>
    <li> real, help for ingrowns</li>
    <li> After more than a year of waxing, I started getting a lot of ingrown hairs (and those were leaving some scars), so I decided to change up the after wax treatment I was using and try PFB. I was delighted that it worked very quickly (in about two weeks) and eliminated all the ingrown hairs and really lightened almost all the scarring. I will continue to use and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Works great for stubborn ingrown hairs. It does make your skin &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; where it&#x27;s been applied. So don&#x27;t be surprised by that, but other then that so far so good!</li>
    <li> This really works for me, I have seen a significant improvement in in-growns in my bikini area.</li>
    <li> works great very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought it at my wax place initially for double the price.  I also use it on my stretch marks that are almost 20yrs old and they have reduced the appearance of them as well.. Double duty use!  Smells a little odd at first and does leave a bit of residue but it will not stain clothing.  Safe to use pretty much anywhere but if you are using after a &amp;#34;Brazilian style wax&amp;#34; wait at least 24hrs after wax and try to keep it away from the &amp;#34; opening&amp;#34; for lack of a more publicly acceptable term lol Also useful for mens razor burn and ingrown hairs!</li>
    <li> Be prepare to have your skin peeled. It works, however, I dislike that smell that it has. It smells like vinegar to me. I use to use it twice a day, but now only once, which is at night time.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this. A little to early to give a definite rating but no complaints so far. I got this due to the other reviews</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews for anything, and I mean NEVER...but I must for this product. Ok this might be TMI but for as long as I can remember, I suffered from horrible ingrown hairs and razor burn in my bikini area. Shaving was literally impossible, hair removal creams made irritation worse, and I had to resort to waxing, but even monthly Brazilians still left me with ingrown hairs that left scars. So not only would I get puss filled ingrowns, after they disappeared I would have a purple dark mark that would last for months. I came across this product, and after doing a little research I gave it a try. I was honestly not hoping for much since every other product has failed me, but THIS PRODUCT IS A MIRACLE WORKER. Changed my life I&#x27;m serious. I apply it once a day to my bikini area after waxing, and since I started this product, I have had not one single ingrown hair. It even lightening my scars to the point where they have almost vanished, and only after about a month and a half of use. It works like magic. No irritation, no redness, prevents and heals ingrown hairs, and got rid of my dark marks from ingrowns. I am so grateful for PFB vanish :)</li>
    <li> I went to a beauty salon to get my under arms waxed and a beautician recommended this product to me. I bought the product at the salon, but checked on Amazon after and it was cheaper at Amazon.com. I love that about Amazon! So far this product has been working really well. My under arms have lightened up and I haven&#x27;t  gotten any more ingrown hairs. I have only been using this product for less than a month and I am looking forward to the results as I continue to use it. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It does have a faint odor that stays around all day, but it&#x27;s great! After about 3 weeks of daily and nightly use my ingrown hairs are almost completely gone. I&#x27;m so excited! I thought I would never find anything that would work.</li>
    <li> this is my holy grail for razor bumps! ever since i started using this its helped with the bumps i would get on my legs after shaving. it does burn though because its pretty much alcohol lol but i love love love it!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend &amp; I both suffer from razor bumps &amp; a person who works at the place I get waxed suggested this we both used it &amp; we love it &amp; its cheaper here &amp; came really fast got to admit I love it them everything</li>
    <li> I used this for like a month everyday. It helped fight rasor bumps but for me I didnt see any lightening. You probably have to wait longer for it to work.</li>
    <li> Always fast delivery. Great price for a great product! Use daily and consistently for best results. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in coloration.</li>
    <li> I get Brazilian waxing and this stuff works!</li>
    <li> Stopped bumps after shaving and prevented darkness. I didn&#x27;t have much success with waxing so I shave my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple weeks and it has really lightened my razor bump scars. It also works well with getting rid of razor bumps. Worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with ingrown hairs since I was 16. I was on a mission to try and find something that works. Bump Zapper worked, but had too many products to use in order to achieve the desired goal. PFB+Chromabright is all I need in one easy roll on. I&#x27;m African American male so it&#x27;s easier for us to get PFB. This stuff works if your looking for something to not only rid yourself of PFB, but correct the scarring then this is for you</li>
    <li> The best thing ever! I use this everyday because I shave everyday and it works no more darkness under my arms! Now I can raise my arms without worries :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over two months, but have not noticed any significant change to my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this thinking i would see at least a small change. Nothing changed at all. This was definitely not the right product for me.</li>
    <li> Product will sting quite a bit. That&#x27;s okay, this is how it works!  I can&#x27;t say it lightened my existing darkening or scars, but it has prevented more ingrowns. Dry your skin thoroughly before application!!</li>
    <li> Been using for a few weeks now. Hoping that, soon, I&#x27;ll see the results that I desire. For the time being, I will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> this is by far one of the best products i have found on amazon. This does as it clames and has made my life of shaving sooo much easier. No more razor bump or white heads from shaving at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the normal PFB Vanish *without* the chromabright for my ingrown hairs for years... I don&#x27;t like the way Tend Skin works (well, doesn&#x27;t work for me) so I needed a different product. I love the roller ball application, it makes things a lot easier and I feel like it eliminates the possibility of wasting product. I have a tattoo on my left hip and I read that chromabright may lighten it (which makes sense) so I am VERY careful that product doesn&#x27;t accidentally get on there. I hope the chromabright aspect does work because I have some scars for ingrown hairs that I&#x27;ve dug out but it&#x27;s too soon to tell. I also have a little tip-- in addition to using this after my shower daily, I put this on right before I walk out the door to get my wax... my esthetician comments that the hair \\&quot;comes off like butter&amp;\\&quot;. Works for me so I reccomend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell-- I think it&#x27;s quite pleasant actually, especially compared to the original formula&#x27;s scent. I wouldn&#x27;t bottle it up and use it as perfume but it is a lot less chemically to me. More perfumey than anything. It doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Tried 3 or 4 bottles of this stuff to fade brown spots.  Very sticky and took a long time to dry.  Didn&#x27;t appear to work, a far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to order my second bottle of this. I have bad ingrown hairs and scars. Using this 2x daily has made a huge difference in minimizing existing ingrown hairs, preventing new ones, and brightening the area to get rid of ugly scars. I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this for years ... now I&#x27;ve finally found it!!</li>
    <li> Take care of ingrowns better than other items. I can&#x27;t speak on the lightening aspect bc I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, but so far it is working.  Easy to use roller ball and no yucky smell. It can be expensive, but at the same time, I used to have another PFB vanish that lasted years. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Okay. Worked a bit. Not the best</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for over a month now and I can see a difference in my skin tone.. As far as getting rid of the bumps..awesome! my bumps were visibly gone within 2 weeks of using this product. I also use an exfoliate for my bikini area that I got from the wax salon along with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so fast.</li>
    <li> Bought this to fix razor bumps/ingrown hairs on bikini line and underarms. It&#x27;s worked in terms of preventing new bumps, but has not helped too much treat existing ones or to fade old scars. (I have medium brown skin and used the product for two months now).</li>
    <li> I had gotten a few ingrown hairs from getting a Brazilian wax prior to my wedding. Loved the wax, HATED the ingrown hairs I got a few weeks later. They left very bright red spots on me down there which stayed for MONTHS. It def decreased my husband and I&#x27;s sex life because I was embarrassed for him to see me naked. I had tried a few different things to help and nothing really made the spots go away. I purchased this product about a month ago and at first there was no change, but after applying it 1-2x/daily for almost a month my red spots are gone! So happy with this product. I finally feel confident with my body again. Def would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This helps me with my wax bumps on my legs and bikini area. It stings a bit but it is normal</li>
    <li> My waxer is always out of this product, because it is that good! That is why I had to see if it was available on line. This is the only product that that ever worked on me.</li>
    <li> This product actually works.  I have much less irritation on my bikini line and dark spots are disappearing.</li>
    <li> get this is you have hair bumps, in grown hairs or dark spots this product is amazing. Don&#x27;t expect results after the first couple times of using it, it takes about 3 weeks to 1 month to see a difference but like anything in life the wait is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it causes some peeling which is good for me cuz I know its working. I dont like how sticky it feels and it does take a few days for the peeling to start.</li>
    <li> I first bought PFB Vanish (the classic version) to diminish the ingrown hairs I would develop after shaving my private areas. I then decided to give PFB Vanish Plus Chromabright a try and religiously used it every day and night for two months to verify for myself if the results spoken of in their official website were true. Because I did not really possess any scars or severely darkened skin, I cannot attest to dramatically visible changes. However I did notice a healthier skin overall and complete lack of ingrown hairs. It is important to highlight however that the use of this product can irritate skin and cause a burning sensation as it is composed of three acids that help diminish ingrown hairs, so applying it immediately after shaving can be a bit painful and can sting for a couple of minutes (2 - 3 minutes). Also, chafing of the skin may occur as the acids work as chemical exfoliators that remove dead skin or outermost skin (again to get rid of ingrown hairs).</li>
    <li> I love this product and I use it everyday.  It definitely helps keep hair from becoming ingrown and it fades the dark marks left behind from shaving or waxing.</li>
    <li> Used this for a good 4-5 months. Havent seen much of a difference. (African American. bikini area. 31)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very prone to ingrown hairs, every time I get a wax it doesn&#x27;t matter how much I exfoliate I seem to always get one.  With this product not only do I not get them but it&#x27;s also making my past scars slowly go away.  I have been applying the product every morning after my shower for the last month and I&#x27;m already very pleased with my results!</li>
    <li> It does all that it claims to do and both my husband I use it. I use it for after waxes and he uses it after he shaves his head and face.</li>
    <li> Item was everything I expected. Was purchased as a gift and this present recipient was happy and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.</li>
</ol>
