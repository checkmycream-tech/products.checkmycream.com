      <li>Let&#x27;s start with the positive, I received these extensions quickly, also they matched my hair color perfectly.</li>
      <li>so, you could go and check it out if you find that helpful and let me know :)</li>

      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>hair is ok.</li>
      <li>For the price I paid they&#x27;re okay.</li>
      <li>My order came in 7 days, the quality is good, and my hair is thinner, so these are just right.  </li>
      <li>( I do not/did not lighten my own hair or the extensions, but I get a nice burgundy with Jazzing Cherry Cola over my hair and the extensions, which are color #4) and it matches pretty well.</li>
      <li>They are super soft and matched my color perfectly!</li>
      <li>Super great length too, so pretty</li>
      <li>I got the discount because I was able to work with the 9 wefts I had available.</li>
      <li>They are soft, silky, add plenty of weight and volume, look great up in a pony tail (how I wear my hair a lot).</li>
      <li>overall its good quality!</li>
      <li>Other than that they are perfect!</li>
      <li>and they were so easy to use, so</li>
      <li>So easy to put in too...</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re still going strong.</li>
      <li>thats fine.</li>
      <li>For the price you pay, these are pretty OK.</li>
      <li>and i can blend them pretty well :)  </li>
      <li>I have done clip ins more than any other kind because they are easily removed and hassle free.</li>
      <li>I was excited when I placed my order for the extensions, but after waiting four weeks for them to arrive, the excitement quickly wore off.</li>
      <li>was super excited because they are the longest ones I have ordered.</li>
      <li>BUT I love them so much I wear them out when I&#x27;m feeling special.</li>
      <li>but I need to go to a professional and have done and cut with my own hair.</li>
      <li>The length was good but this is NOT Human Hair.</li>
      <li>It really does feel like true human hair and the color was great too.  </li>
      <li>Order was delivered quick..</li>
      <li>I think I lucked out with that, and with the texture.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re easy to put in though, and everyone thinks they&#x27;re real.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
      <li>so they will flow into the natural hair better.</li>
      <li>If you want perfection, I suggest either making your own or buying from foxylocks or a similar website.</li>
      <li>and I have natural brown hair and these make me look so cute</li>
      <li>they ship super fast!</li>
      <li>They just blend right in.</li>
      <li>These blend right in with my hair.</li>
      <li>and haha I&#x27;m not really a patient girl :P</li>
      <li>I would personally recommend human hair extensions over synthetic hair extension, The synthetic ones tangle way to easy and honestly</li>
      <li>IF I ever bother trying extensions again, I will be buying much thicker hair!</li>
      <li>The color was an exact match.  </li>
      <li>First I&#x27;d like to say I&#x27;ve never purchased anything like this before, so this is a first timers opinion.</li>
      <li>the clips were sown on in the wrong spots the hair itself is flimsy and not the LENGTH i ordered they are all at the most 16&#x27;&#x27; not 20!!!!</li>
      <li>I have medium-thin hair (so saying it probably wouldn&#x27;t be great for someone with thick hair</li>
      <li>My hair is not quite shoulder length, and I want to wear my hair in a bun when I get married.</li>
      <li>soon as I ripped open the package I was pleased with what I saw.  </li>
      <li>I am also not usually the type of girl that likes writing reveiws, but since this product is working out sooo well for me, I thought it was worth it!</li>
      <li>This was my first time using extensions ever</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have purchased them off of amazon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I recieved these extensions just a couple of days after placing the order.  It shipped from California and I live in Mississippi so I think that&#x27;s GREAT timing &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I ripped open the package I was pleased with what I saw.  It really does feel like true human hair and the color was great too.  Overall, just what I was expecting and I would definitely order again especially with the price as low as it was.</li>
    <li> They came in a super small envelope all folded up, so I&#x27;m not very happy about the shipping (reason for the 4 stars). Other than that they are perfect! They are super soft, not a lot of fall out, and they blend so well! They are a few shades darker than my hair, but that&#x27;s ok I am going to get it done anyways! :) all in all, let&#x27;s just say I will definitely repurchase!!</li>
    <li> I have medium-thin hair (so saying it probably wouldn&#x27;t be great for someone with thick hair [maybe if you buy two]) and I have natural brown hair and these make me look so cute I love them. Super great length too, so pretty</li>
    <li> I read the criticisms of this product but decided to give it a try anyhow. I have long (mid-back) fine and thinning hair. I&#x27;ve been discouraged about my hair for years, ever since I started losing it in my late 20s but have never wanted to fork out the money for salon extensions (even though I&#x27;m a hair stylist). Anyhow, the negatives (from a very few) were that the hair is thin on the ends and that it doesn&#x27;t add a lot of volume. I just tried the extensions tonight and I really loved them! They are soft, silky, add plenty of weight and volume, look great up in a pony tail (how I wear my hair a lot). They aren&#x27;t terribly thin at the bottom but I understand why--so they will flow into the natural hair better. Anyhow, even my husband said they looked awesome and were a perfect match to my hair (even though the extensions are 1-2 levels lighter than my hair color). They just blend right in. So easy to put in too...I just found a youtube instructional video and that made all the difference. I would recommend this to all my fine-haired friends! Excellent value.</li>
    <li> This is great for people that are looking to add more volume to their hair..does not work to add length on short hair unless your hair is really thin then probably it will suit you. It sheds a lot upon opening but it doesnt have a bad smell..overall its good quality! Soft and it looks good! I would just give a thumbs down to how much hair it sheds.</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;d like to say I&#x27;ve never purchased anything like this before, so this is a first timers opinion. Let&#x27;s start with the positive, I received these extensions quickly, also they matched my hair color perfectly. And that will conclude the positives about this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These extensions are so incredibly thin I can&#x27;t imagine they would blend with anyone&#x27;s actual hair. I suppose if you already have very long hair and wanted to add a TINY amount volume they might do the job, but otherwise they are useless! I have medium length hair (about 3 inches past my shoulders) and while it&#x27;s certainly not thin by any definition, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wildly thick either, and these things looked ridiculous in my hair. They didn&#x27;t blend at all, and were very obviously fake. The ends are downright stringy. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these wretched things, it&#x27;s really true in this case, you get what you pay for. IF I ever bother trying extensions again, I will be buying much thicker hair!</li>
    <li> the worst hair I have ever PURCHASED!!! the clips were sown on in the wrong spots the hair itself is flimsy and not the LENGTH i ordered they are all at the most 16&#x27;&#x27; not 20!!!! I feel I was lied to and this is a scam!!! DO NOT ORDER</li>
    <li> I liked it, but have not used it yet; I have practiced using it but I need to go to a professional and have done and cut with my own hair.</li>
    <li> Great quality hair pieces - every time I wear them everyone says they are amazed that they are extensions!  Before buying these, I went to a Ricky&#x27;s and matched up my hair color to a swatch and bought these and they matched perfectly!  And literally a fraction of the price!  These blend right in with my hair.</li>
    <li> good for a quick fix when you cant afford the good stuff. thin, clips break easily, good for maybe 1 months use. would not recommend to women with thick hair</li>
    <li> I was expecting long thick hair, the hair was terribly thin, the ends were like string and it was obvious they were extentions. Two clips even came broken! Waste of my money for sure!</li>
    <li> Order was delivered quick.. I&#x27;ve purchased before and waited a week to a month for delivery.  Was packaged Nicely.  Extra clips were provided.  For the price they seem great.  The thickness was just as described.  The color was an exact match.  When i pulled them out of the packaging there was no shedding, no random other colored hair or thread as I&#x27;ve got from other sellers.  I&#x27;ll update once i wash and straighten</li>
    <li> These extensions are great. They were supposed to come on the 28th, that got bumped up to the 26th and I actually received them on the 24th. Fast shipping great hair,  I did get darker hair than I should have because I have ombré hair so I will be purchasing more in blonde, but that is my bad not theirs. It curls and straightens well, I bleached parts and they are still soft. Good clips too, no slip because they have elastic strips under the clips. Great hair five stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned sooo many kinds of extensions, from sew ins to making my own clip ins. This time, I just got plain lazy with making my own, so I decided to order these, mainly because of the price. For the price you pay, these are pretty OK. As the other reviewers have stated, these extensions are pretty thin - I have thin hair, so it&#x27;s OK for me, but if you have thicker hair, I really suggest at least two packages. The ends are pretty thin, but again, ok for me because I mainly bought these to use with my curling rod, but just keep that in mind. With regards to the quality of the hair, it isn&#x27;t remy as the package suggests, and you shouldn&#x27;t really expect it to be. It takes color well - I use a semi-permanent on my own hair and I colored these to match ( I do not/did not lighten my own hair or the extensions, but I get a nice burgundy with Jazzing Cherry Cola over my hair and the extensions, which are color #4) and it matches pretty well. I haven&#x27;t tried to curl it yet, but from the feel, it seems like it will take a curl well. Over all, these extensions aren&#x27;t too bad and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Mine did come with a few gray hairs and even some thread in weird places, but these are OK with a tiny bit of TLC. If you want perfection, I suggest either making your own or buying from foxylocks or a similar website. For the price you pay, these are pretty decent clip ins and I would recommend them so long as you&#x27;ve done your homework and read the reviews.  ETA: I&#x27;ve had these extensions for over a year and they&#x27;re still going strong. I LOVE how they look when they&#x27;re curled with my bedhead curling wand! I have relaxed african american hair and I&#x27;m able to blend and curl these perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have tons of hair extensions, so I feel I am quite the expert on them. I have done clip ins more than any other kind because they are easily removed and hassle free. This is the first time I have purchased them off of amazon. I usually purchase from proextensions or from wig stores in my area. So, I got them.....was super excited because they are the longest ones I have ordered. The hair quality is nice....kind of thin, but I have thinner hair so it works. HOWEVER, the clips were barely sewn on....and when I washed them to get rid of the horrible chemical smell (typical) tons of hair dye washed out. There were some strands on white hair mixed in....not many....I pulled them off. But....I had to go back and re-sew, and glue every clip onto the wefts because just from opening the clips, they started to fall apart. So...all in all, Id say if you don&#x27;t mind putting in some &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; to get them up to par, they&#x27;re a good deal.........they are much cheaper than many other human hair extensions.</li>
    <li> Super thin, need to order second pack, and i dyed them and washed them and no matter what i do they always look dirty</li>
    <li> I ordered the hair extensions for my granddaughter to use temporarily. They were thinner than I expected (said double weft) but for $40 they did the job:) I would buy again if I was in a pinch.</li>
    <li> The length was good but this is NOT Human Hair. It does NOT come with enough for a whole head. I have one side of my head shaved and this was barely enough to fill the other side. Its very thin</li>
    <li> I really liked them, they are a little thin but it was ok cause i have think hair. They are super soft and matched my color perfectly! and they curl really well &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> My order came in 7 days, the quality is good, and my hair is thinner, so these are just right.  I would pay over $100 for these at Sally&#x27;s.  I am very pleased with this order although the color is lighter than I would like.  I just ordered a darker set.</li>
    <li> This was the worst investment I have made on Amazon. I was excited when I placed my order for the extensions, but after waiting four weeks for them to arrive, the excitement quickly wore off. After receiving them, I quickly they were not the dark brown I had ordered, but a mere orange color. I also noticed I had been short a couple pieces. I contacted the customer service a few days after to bring my problem to their attention. They promptly replied and explained they were on holiday, and wouldn&#x27;t be able to send out the item until a few days later. I waited about a week and followed up with them, asking if the rest of my package was shipped. They said they had sent it out and I should be receiving it within the next couple weeks. It has been almost three months and I still have not gotten the package. When I asked for a refund, they refused unless I had sent the package back. Overall, this product was definitely not worth the wait and was definitely a waste of money. I spent more time emailing the customer service, asking where the rest of the product I paid for was, than actually wearing the product itself. I would definitely not buy from them ever again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Bought two packs and it works great! Color matches my hair perfectly! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more! Texture is great!</li>
    <li> I got to say this has been a great product to buy. I have been working for the money to afford it and I think it was worth it, honestly! I mean any extensions you buy, your always going to get some shedding at least and through-out all the extensions I have bought in the past, this prodect has the least shedding by far! Since I am a bi-racial girl, I do have corse hair so the extensions dont match the texture but once I have given it 2-3 washes it has mached perfectly! The only reason why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because the standard shipping took a long time to come and haha I&#x27;m not really a patient girl :P I am also not usually the type of girl that likes writing reveiws, but since this product is working out sooo well for me, I thought it was worth it! I also do have a video up on youtube about this product (unpackaging and everythin) so, you could go and check it out if you find that helpful and let me know :) [...]</li>
    <li> The hair came 5 days after order so a week before it was scheduled wich made me very happy! Hairwas great quality and they even sent extra clips for them. Little shedding upon opening they did have the normal extention smell ti them. Super soft and thick as well, any questions email me jlynn_26@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> I would personally recommend human hair extensions over synthetic hair extension, The synthetic ones tangle way to easy and honestly just flat out look fake. If you are looking for cheap extensions with excellent quality then I would buy these. (:&lt;br /&gt;And they ship super fast!</li>
    <li> Good hair a little thin at the bottom bit thats fine. came about 2 weeks before estimated date. also came with 3 extra clips 2 tester strands and a thank you letter, Great doing business!</li>
    <li> These hair extensions suck. They went bad in 2 months. Constantly feels gross. The clips don&#x27;t work good, they weren&#x27;t sewed on good. The color matched my hair perfectly but I hate these. 😡</li>
    <li> I bought these extensions to wear at my wedding. My hair is not quite shoulder length, and I want to wear my hair in a bun when I get married. These extensions serve there purpose for my wedding: to put my hair in a bun. I would never wear these otherwise. When my hair is down, the extensions are so thin it is obvious I am wearing extensions. Although they are inexpensive, they are not worth the money. Better to pay a little extra and get hair you can wear.</li>
    <li> A little on the thin side had them for a month but still love them. I&#x27;d buy 2 packs for thickness.</li>
    <li> My extensions arrived in a week and were a perfect match color-wise.  I think I lucked out with that, and with the texture.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re easy to put in though, and everyone thinks they&#x27;re real.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> Looks real, but the tips/ ends of the hair is really thin, so when i wear it, it looks like i got a big head coz the upper part is thick then the end is thin...weird! Lol. And it also come in many pieces, so u reallly have to save some time for putting them</li>
    <li> I bought these and dyed them to my hair color so they match and they are great. I did cut them a little bit because the ends weren&#x27;t how I liked them.</li>
    <li> I would totally buy them again! It&#x27;s a bargain for the price I payed and the quality i got. Completely satisfied, the hair is thin so as my hair...</li>
    <li> I was missing 2 pieces.. hair is ok. I will not buy no more.  Is way to think if u have think hair</li>
    <li> For the price I paid they&#x27;re okay. However, they are very thin I would suggest ordering two packets.</li>
    <li> Piece of shit! Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Hair is not what I was looking for thin at the ends and not enoght hair for me think I&#x27;m going to stick with sallys and keeps falling out uhhhh :(</li>
    <li> I purchased these clip-ins for a photo shoot thinking I would use them once and never again. BUT I love them so much I wear them out when I&#x27;m feeling special. I ordered medium brown because the auburn color was out, but it matches my auburn hair surprisingly well! Pleasant surprise. I wish there were a few more clip ins though, this set looked a tiny bit too thin for my thick hair, but it&#x27;s passable.</li>
    <li> Color matched perfectly. I already have pretty long hair and was looking for extensions to add thickness for when I do braids or curl my hair. These were thinner than I expected but with all the pieces in the set it&#x27;s totally served it&#x27;s purpose. If you have long hair already I would definitely recommend these, but if you have short hair you won&#x27;t like them.</li>
    <li> the shipping was very fast, and when I got them they were silky soft. I still have them and they are still in perfect shape. I recommend these! (:</li>
    <li> Love these extensions. I don&#x27;t have thick hair so they worked out great for me. Use them all the time. They were really soft and matched my hair color. I would definately order again.</li>
    <li> They arrived immediately. I ordered them a Sunday night they shipped Monday and I got them Wednesday. They are amazingly long, pretty, and soft. This was my first time using extensions ever and they were so easy to use, so if you&#x27;re a beginner and want to give these a try...do it! The clips hold in great, they don&#x27;t slip out and I didn&#x27;t had to tease my hair despite the fact that I have thin hair. I&#x27;ve curled them, straighten them and probably will dye them soon. They match my hair color so well. The only reason why I give them 4 stars is because I was missing one weft. So instead of 10 pieces I only got 9. I contacted customer service and they gave me 2 options, either I sent them back and re order or I keep them and get a 15% discount. I got the discount because I was able to work with the 9 wefts I had available. I&#x27;m in love! (:</li>
    <li> I was very nervous after ordering these...but honestly these are just like the sallys ones...i love them!!! they are great! i only gave them a 4 because they are a bit thin but i am mixed and i can blend them pretty well :)  i will be getting these again.</li>
