      <li>Overall a great product.</li>
      <li>Andalou Naturals Citrus Kombucha Cleansing Gel is a gentle and effective cleanser.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it with the Andalou oil free moisturizer</li>
      <li>This leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth after using.</li>
      <li>Takes off all my makeup and leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I use it both with a clarisonic and without, and it gets my face clean without drying it out.  </li>
      <li>I tried this cleanser because it was oil free and had a good score on the EWG Skin Deep website.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special</li>
      <li>and it sounded perfect - like exactly what my recent acne-prone skin needed to clear up.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my mild acne and the vileness of my face.</li>
      <li>my skin becomes dryer after using it, and i dont feel super freshness  or cleansing</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and will continue to use the products in the future.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll always come back for more!</li>
      <li>and I am sometimes allergic to skin care, so I love the natural ingredients in this cleanser...</li>
      <li>This one really gets my skin clean and I love the citrus smell, and the fact that it has natural ingredients not tested on animals.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product regularly, and I find that it has been doing a really good job of keeping my skin clear.</li>
      <li>The product is very mild and not harsh on the skin.</li>
      <li>Face feels soft &amp; clean after using</li>
      <li>This cleanser worked immediately, the price is right and it cleared my cheek bumps OVERNIGHT, seriously, WOW!</li>
      <li>I am very pick about putting chemicals on my skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only ever had a reaction to nuetrogena oil free acne wash.</li>
      <li>My skin is healing, I&#x27;m not breaking out more like I do with other face wash</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way cheaper than a lot of products, but still gives you that high-end deep clean.</li>
      <li>This line leaves my skin very smooth and my pores less visible.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think a natural and trusted brand like Andalou could make my skin react this way - really bummed!</li>
      <li>Hand down, my favorite brand of skincare products.</li>
      <li>Since adolescence, my skin has gone through various phases of breaking out in mild to severe acne.</li>
      <li>, a little goes a long way, my pores tighten up, my skin feels great after cleaning and it does not dry up my skin.  </li>
      <li>My skin has become very sensitive</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not harsh at all!  </li>
      <li>These two products have my face looking better than ever, pores are smaller and very few breakouts, and they really control oil.</li>
      <li>The price is not unreasonable given all the natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I have oily, acne-prone, extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended Andalou products for its natural properties/containing probiotics.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s gentle enough</li>
      <li>It has taken nearly a week for my skin to retain moisture and return back to normal.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but cleans very well.</li>
      <li>My skin tends to be on the dry side in some areas and normal in others.  </li>
      <li>Same results as last time thus far.</li>

<li> Same results as last time thus far.</li>
<li> Other products leave my sensitive face swollen, red and irritated.</li>
<li> I used this face wash at night and it felt a little drying, but in the morning my face was burning red and felt like sandpaper - my pores were completely bumpy and irritated.</li>
<li> I still have some oiliness after a long day but now like before using the clarifying line.  </li>
<li> This particular cleanser I find is a little harsh for my skin for daily use.</li>
<li> I noticed it was pretty runny when I first got it, but didn&#x27;t realize that it was supposed to be a different consistency. :(</li>
<li> I would especially recommend using this product after using sunscreen or any other products that may irritate your skin.</li>
<li> My pores are not congested and my skin actually seems a little tighter.  </li>
<li> This product is not at all harsh on my skin, so it does not cause any dryness or discomfort, even with daily use.</li>
<li> All were quite effective, though none of them ever cleared a few persistently annoying tiny bumps on my cheeks.</li>
<li> I have dry skin, but I don&#x27;t mind the tight feeling after using a cleanser.</li>
<li> Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this, I&#x27;ll be a lifelong customer!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about plant stem cells (the research seems to be inconclusive), but I do definitely like this product.  </li>
<li> This formula feels like it foams slightly while the others don&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Occasionally a little tight feeling, but I use moisturizer so that isn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
<li> A bit drying but nothing a little lotion can&#x27;t solve.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the probiotic face lotion/cream for weeks with no significant difference but saw this clarifying face wash</li>
<li> black tea ferment, fruit stem cells (malus domestica, solar vitis) and bioactive 8 berry complex</li>
<li> Moreover, Proactiv seemed to cause wrinkles, Skinceuticals and Philosophy are expensive and only worked sometimes</li>
<li> I have been using it for about 6 months and have not noticed any red spots or bad reactions.  </li>
<li> so finding products that work well has been difficult.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great face wash and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product regularly, and I find that it has been doing a really good job of keeping my skin clear. This product is not at all harsh on my skin, so it does not cause any dryness or discomfort, even with daily use. I found that my skin became clearer after about two weeks. I would especially recommend using this product after using sunscreen or any other products that may irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> I have used all three versions of the Andalou Naturals skin cleanser and I think this is my favorite.  This formula feels like it foams slightly while the others don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not harsh at all!  My skin tends to be on the dry side in some areas and normal in others.  This leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth after using.</li>
    <li> Great product will continue to order.</li>
    <li> my skin becomes dryer after using it, and i dont feel super freshness  or cleansing</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for years and I&#x27;ve tried everything. This is the only thing that works for me. I swear by it! Other products leave my sensitive face swollen, red and irritated. With this I can feel the difference immediately! By the next day I see results! I used it about a year ago but could never find it in the stores, I can&#x27;t believe I forgot about the internet! Same results as last time thus far. My skin is healing, I&#x27;m not breaking out more like I do with other face wash and it&#x27;s gentle enough I can use it twice daily without over drying my skin!! I love it!! I&#x27;ll always come back for more! Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this, I&#x27;ll be a lifelong customer! And it smells delicious and lemony.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Andalou products for its natural properties/containing probiotics. I&#x27;ve been using the probiotic face lotion/cream for weeks with no significant difference but saw this clarifying face wash and it sounded perfect - like exactly what my recent acne-prone skin needed to clear up. I used this face wash at night and it felt a little drying, but in the morning my face was burning red and felt like sandpaper - my pores were completely bumpy and irritated. I must have had an allergic reaction to something in this face wash. I&#x27;ve only ever had a reaction to nuetrogena oil free acne wash. It has taken nearly a week for my skin to retain moisture and return back to normal. I didn&#x27;t think a natural and trusted brand like Andalou could make my skin react this way - really bummed! I definitely will not being testing any of their products again</li>
    <li> This is very good cleanser i well buy it again</li>
    <li> Since adolescence, my skin has gone through various phases of breaking out in mild to severe acne. I&#x27;ve used everything, from Proactiv, Skinceuticals, Philosophy and dermatologist prescriptions. All were quite effective, though none of them ever cleared a few persistently annoying tiny bumps on my cheeks. I began to accept those as permanent. Moreover, Proactiv seemed to cause wrinkles, Skinceuticals and Philosophy are expensive and only worked sometimes and antibiotics are for emergencies only. This cleanser worked immediately, the price is right and it cleared my cheek bumps OVERNIGHT, seriously, WOW!</li>
    <li> It does the job. Nothing special</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cleanser! Takes off all my makeup and leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed. Smells great, too.</li>
    <li> Face feels soft &amp; clean after using</li>
    <li> I tried this cleanser because it was oil free and had a good score on the EWG Skin Deep website.  It receives a 3 out of 10 (at the time of this review), which is an acceptable rating for me.  The highest allergic ingredient listed is Lemon Verbena (they consider every possible allergy when analyzing the ingredients).  I am very pick about putting chemicals on my skin and I am sometimes allergic to skin care, so I love the natural ingredients in this cleanser...and it still smells good which is a plus!  I have been using it for about 6 months and have not noticed any red spots or bad reactions.  I use it both with a clarisonic and without, and it gets my face clean without drying it out.  Occasionally a little tight feeling, but I use moisturizer so that isn&#x27;t an issue for me. The bottle lasted me about 4 months washing 2x a day. The price is not unreasonable given all the natural ingredients.  I will continue to re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face wash, it&#x27;s the best I have used!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use if you are looking for something that won&#x27;t irritate your skin. The product is very mild and not harsh on the skin. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my face</li>
    <li> Great cleanser, I&#x27;m 33 with blemish prone skin and this is a great addition to my skin care routine, I also use the serum and moisturizer by this brand. I would definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> Great product, I enjoy this entire line. This particular cleanser I find is a little harsh for my skin for daily use. I alternate between another cleanser and this one throughout the week</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have oily, blemish-prone skin and have tried everything. This one really gets my skin clean and I love the citrus smell, and the fact that it has natural ingredients not tested on animals. It is clarifying and it will dry out your skin so it is best used along with Andalou Naturals Oil Control beauty balm. These two products have my face looking better than ever, pores are smaller and very few breakouts, and they really control oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Andalou Clarifying line for about a month now and I am very pleased with it.  I am 51 and have fair skin with an oily T-zone.  My skin has become very sensitive so finding products that work well has been difficult.  This line leaves my skin very smooth and my pores less visible.  I still have some oiliness after a long day but now like before using the clarifying line.  My pores are not congested and my skin actually seems a little tighter.  The fragrance is clean smelling.  I am very pleased and will continue to use the products in the future.</li>
    <li> Andalou Naturals Citrus Kombucha Cleansing Gel is a gentle and effective cleanser. I use it daily and nightly (with a washcloth). I love the smell -- like fruity candy or something. It&#x27;s a great cleanser for my oily, acne-prone skin. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase it.    Ingredients:  Aloe barbadensis juice*, decyl glucoside, sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, vegetable glycerin, sodium PCA, saccharum officinarum (sugar cane) and citrus medica limonum (lemon) juices*, saccharomyces xylinum (kombucha) black tea ferment, fruit stem cells (malus domestica, solar vitis) and bioactive 8 berry complex*, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (vitamin C), vitis vinifera (grape seed) polyphenols, lippia citriodora (verbena) extract, salix alba (willow bark) extract*, citric acid, tocopherol (vitamin E), aspalathus linearis (rooibos) extract*, allantoin, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethylhexylglycerin, cymbopogon flexuosus (lemongrass) oil, citrus aurantifolia (lime) oil*  *Certified Organic  Fair Trade</li>
    <li> I like this. It smells nice, it cleanses well. It&#x27;s way cheaper than a lot of products, but still gives you that high-end deep clean. I have dry skin, but I don&#x27;t mind the tight feeling after using a cleanser. That&#x27;s what moisturizing is for...</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face wash. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but cleans very well. It takes all of my mascara off without needing extra products for makeup removal. I&#x27;ve been using it with the Andalou oil free moisturizer and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my mild acne and the vileness of my face. I will definitely buy this again. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about plant stem cells (the research seems to be inconclusive), but I do definitely like this product.  *Update 6/26- I still give the product 5 stars, but Ive noticed mine is much more liquid than it should be. It&#x27;s not like a gel at all. I noticed it was pretty runny when I first got it, but didn&#x27;t realize that it was supposed to be a different consistency. :(</li>
    <li> once or twice week is all you need, lasts longer than you think</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser for my skin and it smells yummy, a little goes a long way, my pores tighten up, my skin feels great after cleaning and it does not dry up my skin.  Great for combo skin.</li>
    <li> Smells so refreshing! I feel good after using this cleansing gel, but sometimes I feel like I have to rinse it again and again because my face feels so silky.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, cleans well and hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out. A bit drying but nothing a little lotion can&#x27;t solve.</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne-prone, extremely sensitive skin. This is a great, gentle, effective cleanser that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin.I end up using 1/2 a pump for cleansing. My acne has definitely improved with continued use of this entire line. The environmentally friendly and humane ingredients put it over the top. Hand down, my favorite brand of skincare products.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works well and smells great.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Works well, just not as strong as a tea tree cleanser</li>
</ol>
