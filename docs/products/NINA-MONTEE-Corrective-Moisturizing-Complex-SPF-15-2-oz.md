    <li> My skin feels younger! What else can I say? Great price, great product! I am a happy satisfied customer using the moisturizer &amp; the Cleanser[[ASIN:B009K1EG1O NINA MONTEE Exfoliating Cleanser, 8 fl oz]] My skin feels 20 years younger. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I am a male with strawberry blonde hair with dry fair skin. This product is so fantastic. When you clean your face really good with the Nina Montee Scrub, then apply the cream just before going to bed--your face will be glowing on waking in the morning. You will use it from now on. I bought the oil-free; however, was not for me. I gave it to my niece who is 15 years old and she loves it. She ordered the scrub and her skin is looking great as she has pimples. She loves the product.</li>
    <li> Truly a great all around face cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, morning and evening, and I&#x27;m getting really good results. I use it in combination with the cleanser from the same company, and I&#x27;m very happy with the way my skin looks. My skins is usually combination, dry cheeks and oily T-zone, so I like that it now feels moisturized yet the cream does not feel \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; or oily in any way. I had no problems with the AHA in it, as far as sensitivity, it seems to be helping my somewhat enlarged pores. I also love that its SPF 15, I&#x27;m a busy mom and appreciate that convenience!</li>
    <li> Nina Montee Corrective Moisturizing Complex SPF 15 is a great moisturizer that I started using after my dermatologist recommended it to help prevent sun damage and reduce my wrinkles .  The product is amazing! This just proves that one does not have to spend a lot of money on a moisturizer to get great results!!</li>
    <li> If your looking for a quality product that&#x27;s easy to use and gives consistent results, this should be your new moisturizer. I love that it is not scented or greasy and feels rich and creamy. No SPF \\&quot;afterfeel\\&quot; or residue. Find myself wanting to use it several times a day...like a big slurp of water for my skin!  How great is that?</li>
    <li> I have a dry, sensitive skin, and I noticed the difference in my skin tone and texture very quickly. I just put it on my face and neck every night before I go to sleep and, I wake up with silky and smooth looking skin the more I use it.  For best results I use this moisturizer with NINA MONTEE Exfoliating Cleanser, and my face literally glows. Absolutely perfect product! I am in love with it already!</li>
    <li> This came to my attention at the right time as my skin needed some moisturizing. It is highly effective and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using this cream and I already love it! My skin feels super soft and hydrated and I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s also protected from the sun!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend, and I gave it a try!&lt;br /&gt;When I touched the product, I was worried that it might be too heavy and it will just sit on my face (like other heavy moisturizer cream). But to be my surprise, it just gets absorbed into my skin right away! So it didn&#x27;t leave me with heavy oily residue, but it completely got absorbed! It didn&#x27;t leave any greasiness and my face was nice and moisturized. Only complaint, I might have is the scent may be little strong for me. But other than that, I have no complaints. For this price, it&#x27;s a great cream to use!</li>
    <li> My mature skin definitely appreciates this moisturizer. It needs very little of this light cream yet feels soft and moist after every application. I also love that it is so easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It may sound unusual, but this is a powerful yet very gentle moisturizing cream. At first, I was hesitant to use it since I have a very sensitive skin but that is the brilliance of this product! Finally, people like me can enjoy the benefits of potent AHA acid, WITHOUT the redness and inflammation it can provoke. (Apply it sparingly under the eyes... until you get used to it.) My dermatologist told me that AHA really helps with dead skin cells and causes a micro/invisible peeling that makes all the difference in the world!</li>
    <li> Nina Montee offers both great quality and price.  I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer worked well for my skin.</li>
    <li> I got it as a gift from a girlfriend who has been using it for a while. It is so nourishing and gentle on the skin. Needless to say, I become a regular user and I tossed all my other products away! Great find!</li>
    <li> When I start using NINA MONTEE Corrective Moisturizing Complex SPF I was pleasantly surprised how easy to use it. I has very silky texture, so even if I use a very small amount of the cream, I found out that it is very easy to distribute it evenly around my face and neck. It also absorbed easily by my skin. But the most pleasant to see, that it actually works! My skin looks better and wrinles are not so visible anymore. Recenetly somebody gave me a compliment: \\&quot;You look so yang for your age, what is your secret?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The answer was simple: \\&quot;NINA MONTEE&#x27;s facial products :)\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I found I did not need to use a lot of this cream on my more mature skin.  It was easily absorbed and not at all greasy. I can definitely see an improvement now in my skin.  Another benefit is the low price.</li>
    <li> After living in California for some 15 years, I unfortunately have some serious sun damage and brown spots. The Corrective Moisturizing Complex has done wonders for smoothing out the texture of my skin and evening the tone. I get compliments - all the time - on my \\&quot;youthful glow\\&quot; and on how great my skin looks! LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I used to have blotchy, normal/combination skin with adult acne.  I would be scared to use moisturizers because they made my skin break out.  Then, a few years ago, I got Nina Montee Corrective Moisturizing Complex from a doctor&#x27;s office and I am totally hooked! My skin is smoother, silkier, healthier!  My pores are tight and overall my skin rarely develops pimples or irritations. It&#x27;s just amazing what a difference one product can make.  I also use their Exfoliating Cleanser and love it.  I only wish they made a travel size.</li>
    <li> Nina Montee Corrective Moisturizing Complex is the answer for: fine lines and wrinkles, uneven skin tone, sun spots, dry skin, large pores... And it has a protective SPF 15! All in one - G R E A T!</li>
    <li> The Nina Montee Corrective Moisturizer Complex SPF 15 leaves the skin nice and moisture.  Irritates my eyelids, but it works well in the rest of my face.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my skin needed. My skin feels great ever since i started using this product. Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the perfect amount of moisture for my skin.  It&#x27;s light and non-greasy and makes my face feel super soft!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought the corrective moisturizing complex and exfoliating cleanser and I&#x27;m really happy with both of these products so far! The moisturizer leaves my face nice and smooth and moisturized, not dry or greasy. And I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it - feels very natural. The exfoliating cleanser isn&#x27;t too rough and it really helps get rid of makeup and leaves my skin clear and clean.</li>
    <li> For anyone with aging, dehydrated skin with loss of elasticity and firmness - these are the best products on the market!  I&#x27;ve used Nina Montee Corrective Moisturizer and Exfoliating Cleanser for about 3 months now. I&#x27;ve seen absolutely amazing results in just 3-4 weeks as my brown sun/age spots disappeared completely (I am only 52). The unexpectedly fast results made me so happy - I am telling everyone!</li>
    <li> My neighbor (who has amazing skin) recommended this cream to me as the only product she uses. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to be hooked. I love the consistency (not too thick or too thin, just perfect for a moisturizer) and the fact that there is NO SMELL even though it has SPF in it - I find it very hard to find creams with SPF in them that don&#x27;t have a scent (which i can&#x27;t stand!). What sealed the deal for me were the compliments i got just a couple months after starting to use the cream - one from a makeup artist doing my makeup! I am usually told (especially by aestheticians) that my skin is very dry, so I was very surprised to hear that I have \\&quot;good skin\\&quot; - not something i am usually told! I am already well into my second tub and am converted for life!!</li>
