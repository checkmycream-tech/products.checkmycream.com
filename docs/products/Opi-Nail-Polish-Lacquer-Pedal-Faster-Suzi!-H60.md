      <li>It looks better on longer nails, IMO.  </li>

      <li>This beautiful light pink has a shimmer in it that catches the eye nicely.  </li>
      <li>Has a hint of glitter to the perfect light pink.</li>
      <li>It wears well, doesn&#x27;t chip off and with a top coat lasted a full week without fading or wearing.</li>

      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t wear off like some cheap nail colors.</li>
      <li>Way to light, looks nothing like picture.  </li>

      <li>I am so happy with this purchase I was looking for something similar here in town, and I could not find it!</li>
      <li>This goes on clean and looks fabulous when done.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, but not crazy about the gritty &#x27;flecks&#x27; of whatever makes it sparkle.</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>It is a wonderful everyday color!</li>
      <li>The company I received this from was quick, efficient and friendly.</li>

      <li>overall nice color</li>
      <li>More lavender than pink and very light even with 3 coats that 1 person recommended--not much sparkle either.  </li>
      <li>As my fingernails are never all the same length, I prefer very light colors for them.</li>
      <li>Soft pretty light summer shimmer.</li>
      <li>Really pretty color...</li>
      <li>You will definitely need to put on more than two coats to get the effect in the picture.</li>

      <li>It is pretty when you use one coat</li>
      <li>This pinkish hue(pedal faster suzi) is exactly as the picture illustrations</li>

      <li>Opaque with a pretty shimmer.  </li>

      <li>Good for all year round.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a Beautiful color--just as pictured...and I received the polish within days of ordering it...I&#x27;m really happy! Thank you.</li>
    <li> LOVE OPI POLISH THIS COLOR IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
    <li> very subtle color - looks very natural- goes with anything</li>
    <li> The color is too much like bubble gum pink. It is okay, though. It is pretty when you use one coat but it is very light.</li>
    <li> I love the color as it appears on line, once I received the polish I had to apply several thick coats for it to be like the picture. Its a beautiful color, but with just 1 coat its very dainty, subtle. Something I&#x27;ll wear for spring &amp; summer with sandals.</li>
    <li> I like this polish, but it looked a little darker in photo than it is. Save it for next summer when I wear light, sheer colors. I have never used Opi polish before. It went on easy and looks good.</li>
    <li> i loved this product i bought it used right away&lt;br /&gt;the color is pink very subtle and proffesional&lt;br /&gt;if you think this color is lavender then you are color blind&lt;br /&gt;quality better than i expected i bought nail polish tha chips the same&lt;br /&gt;day  i use it ,  as long as i do not do hard labor like  scrubing things it lasts up to a week with the opi natural base and top coat i definetly will be buying more OPI products !</li>
    <li> I love the color and the sparkle in it.  I usually like a lighter pink than this, but it is a very nice color and wears well.  It looks good with many things and I am very satisfied that I purchased it.  As always Opi products are very good!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome colour. I am brown skinned and it takes a ton of colour in the nail polish to show up. Two/three coats is pretty on brown skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish, nail polish companies would have some way to indicate how sheer nail polish is. A lot of colours do not show up on my nails but this one is pretty pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller - delivered on time and the item was well packed - excellent!</li>
    <li> This is a great color for all seasons, but just perfect for spring.  It has a little sparkle, but not too much so it can be worn in a professional work setting!  Can&#x27;t wait to get another manicure/pedicure in this color!</li>
    <li> Love this color and brush consistency for perfect mani/pedi.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t be fooled to think it is closer to a violet color. It was the exact pale pink I was looking for with a little sparkle.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is so pretty you guys!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, but not crazy about the gritty &#x27;flecks&#x27; of whatever makes it sparkle.</li>
    <li> Great color just wish polish lasted longer without chipping.</li>
    <li> The company I received this from was quick, efficient and friendly. The color is lovely and appears to have a youthful glow due to the silver specs in the formula.</li>
    <li> This color is a soft bubblegum pink that has a nice shimmer! It is a wonderful everyday color! I have had lots of compliments from friends and co-workers!</li>
    <li> Love the color and the subtle sparkle.</li>
    <li> Color not as expected.  Way to light, looks nothing like picture.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> OPI has always had quality products . This pinkish hue(pedal faster suzi) is exactly as the picture illustrations and I loved it.</li>
    <li> Great color and stays on well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Has a hint of glitter to the perfect light pink.</li>
    <li> You will definitely need to put on more than two coats to get the effect in the picture. Very pretty though.</li>
    <li> This is not exactly the color I was hoping for but it is pretty.  I would still by more OPI.</li>
    <li> Really pretty color...as always.  Good for all year round.  Soft and pretty for everyday wear.  I can&#x27;t get enough of the different pinks that OPI offers.</li>
    <li> I match my clothes to the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparkly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPi has great illuminating colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad it was not limited.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color for summer, it stays on like no other. OPI is the best polish u can get for staying on and the packing was awesome, and delivery was fastest than I could of ever thought. Thank u for the shipment.</li>
    <li> Just the way I like my pink nail polish!  Opaque with a pretty shimmer.  Polish is of a nice consistency and is an easy application.  Just the pink I was looking for!</li>
    <li> The color is more lite lavender than pink.  The coverage is thin.  It does not look like the color pictured.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish. It&#x27;s the same brand as used in the nail salons and goes on thinner than the other name brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.  As such, it dries faster and can be built up easier. As for the color &amp;#34;Pedal Faster Suzi!&amp;#34;; I&#x27;ve finally found a color that compliments my fair/pale skin rather than slaps you in the face.</li>
    <li> I love this slight shimmer this pink color has.  Anyone who knows me will tell you I DO NOT do pink (my favorite color is black).  But when I saw this color online I just had to have it.  I was not disappointed.  It looks better on longer nails, IMO.  Love it, love it.  This is ONE pink I will allow in my home. :)</li>
    <li> OPI has a lot of light colors to choose from.  As my fingernails are never all the same length, I prefer very light colors for them.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this soft pink color.  OPI has created another winning color!  Very feminine and has the hint of sparkle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s EXACTLY the color I wanted! I do like to do the &#x27;girly pinks&#x27; from time to time. This is PERFECT for those times.  I usually where bright orange or deep red... but sometimes I just have to be girly and wear pink! This goes on clean and looks fabulous when done.</li>
    <li> This brand is the only one my wife uses.  She even takes it to the nail solon with her because she doesn&#x27;t like the stuff they use.</li>
    <li> I am usually very skeptical when buying pink nail polish. Either it is so faint you need 4 to 5 layers th make it look like the picture. Or It goes on like finger paint all chalkey and clumpy. at least that has been my experiance until this one. My second opi pink. This blowes the first out of the watter as far as smooth even coverage with only two layers it&#x27;s beautiful. Also the sparkle is not like glitter it is a smooth texture free finish. Also if I may suggest you use Nubar star sparkle as a top coat.It makes a lovely christmasy green and red sparkle on top of the pretty pink. Merry christmass everybody xoxo.</li>
    <li> OPI is the best!  I originally bought this for the name alone! &amp;lt;3 but this polish is gorgeous. Very classy pink, excellent shine, stays on with two coats and a top coat will make it last as long as gel colors. Love this &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> goes on easily, no streaking, definitely requires 3 coats to get the full effect of the color. Super feminine, love Opi</li>
    <li> More lavender than pink and very light even with 3 coats that 1 person recommended--not much sparkle either.  Did not hold up as well as other colors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love this color! At first I thought it was a more \\&quot;mom\\&quot; color, but it works perfectly for anyone! It felt like a shimmery bubble gum barbie pink.</li>
    <li> Of course, the excellent quality we may expect from OPI.  Goes on smooth, dries quickly, chip resistant, gorgeous color. This is a very soft pastel pink with a bit of shimmer.  Very pretty.</li>
    <li> Color is beautiful, it does have a sparkle to it.  Also the polish stays on long.  Really like this brand, can&#x27;t wait to try some other colors!</li>
    <li> I love this color.  It is shimmery and just about baby pink in hue.  I do have to use 3 coats, however, or brush marks are visible.  Used with OPI base and top coat, this lasts me 3-4 weeks on a pedicure.</li>
    <li> What can I say opi did it again!  Soft pretty light summer shimmer. To me it has just a slight hint of lavendar...</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase I was looking for something similar here in town, and I could not find it!</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer...you have to add at least 3 coats.  It&#x27;s too sheer for me.  Will give it away.</li>
    <li> I love this color for the end of winter and into spring. It&#x27;s soft and femininine, not too childish. I wear it a lot!</li>
    <li> its nice very good color but u need 2 or 3 coat overall nice color i love it n enjoy it</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this polish yet, but I love the color.  I can tell by looking at it, that it&#x27;s going to sparkle.</li>
    <li> The color is nice, but it isn&#x27;t as rich as it appears in the picture, even after 2 coats the shade is still a little faint.</li>
    <li> I,love opi. This color is amazing. Very soft and feminine looking. Looks great on toes also. I would recommend this product for sure!</li>
    <li> It was the perfect shade and the polish glides on nicely. This was a great purchase. I would definitely order another.</li>
    <li> This is a fun nail polish.  It goes on very thick and when it dries it is very milky in color.  It&#x27;s not a creme polish but more matte finish with sparkles in it.  Adding a top coat makes it shine.  I really like it on my toes but right now the thicker matte finish is popular.  You can do the job in one coat with this polish.  It wears well, doesn&#x27;t chip off and with a top coat lasted a full week without fading or wearing.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is so very sweet and subtle.  Darker shades of lip and nails are not just for winter.  This beautiful light pink has a shimmer in it that catches the eye nicely.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will look like in the summer against nice tan feet and hands.  Definitly a great shade of pink that&#x27;s not in-your-face bubblegum girl.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and it doesn&#x27;t wear off like some cheap nail colors. It looks exactly how it is in the picture</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shimmery pale pink. I&#x27;m not a huge pink fan, I love wacky nail polish, but you always need a nice pink on hand to be appropriate in certain situations. Covers nice, kinda needs 3 coats, maybe because I make them so thin.</li>
