    <li> Good quality and the price too</li>
    <li> The screen protector was a little bit too small , didn&#x27;t fit my entire screen very well.</li>
    <li> Within 3 days I found 2 cracks on the protector. Waste of money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s false advertising cause the change I have in my packets broke it that is what I bought 2nd that one damaged to so I give it one star mines</li>
    <li> Love love love it!  Great product and the price was awesome!!  Going to buy another for my son!</li>
    <li> Great and as described. Will buy and recommend them.</li>
    <li> I bought this case a few months ago, and was excited to get this screen protector. I got this out of the package and pulled the back off and this thing literally just snapped in half. Would not recommend this at all!!</li>
    <li> These are great if you&#x27;re prone to dropping your phone. I dropped mine recently and the cover had a hairline crack you could only see if you tilted it a certain way. I&#x27;m not even sure how long it had been there. I needed to get a new because (I swear this is true!) my puppy ate it. Well, kind of. It was in my back pocket and because it sticks out a bit he found it and chewed on it. It ended up cracking the edge a little. That&#x27;s when I noticed the hairline crack. Because I was able to get it from Amazon at such an incredibly low price (I&#x27;ve paid up to $80 for one!), I ordered 5 more.</li>
    <li> Did not last long not great quality</li>
    <li> The moment I was about to put it on my phone the screen protector broke! I wasn&#x27;t even putting any pressure on it since I know they are very delicate idk if it&#x27;s made of cheap material or what but I disliked it !</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Took forever and a day to arrive but it&#x27;s perfect. Definitely will protect the screen :)</li>
    <li> Dont get this unless you have the iphone 6 plus. I have an iphone 6 and it says iphone 6 but i got a plus screen protector instead.</li>
