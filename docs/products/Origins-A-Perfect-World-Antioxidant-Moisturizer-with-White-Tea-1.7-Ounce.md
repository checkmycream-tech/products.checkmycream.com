      <li>It&#x27;s quite amazing how fast my hands are moisturized after using this product.</li>
      <li>So much so that people have commented how nice my skin</li>
      <li>Have been using this cream in the winters for years and moisturizes dry skin beautifully.</li>
      <li>I had to write about this because I love it so much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good basic moisturizer -</li>

      <li>I really like the smell and the fact that it has NOT made my skin break out.  </li>
      <li>I really like to mix up the moisturisers at night</li>
      <li>Not like any other brands that costs way more that you have to reapply again and again to achieve that moisture your skin needs.</li>
      <li>What I HIGHLY recommend however is the Origins Balanced Diet lightweight moisturizer (which I use now).  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this</li>
      <li>Just be sure to use a little and build up to the amount you will need.  </li>
      <li>One single application on your face will keep your face in good moisture up to 3 days in a very extreme winter season.</li>
      <li>live without\\&quot; moisturizer.  </li>

      <li>very soft on.</li>
      <li>highly  recommend you give it a try no harsh chemicals or fragrance</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s silky smooth and feels a little sticky when applied</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 35 years old guy.</li>
      <li>I can see how it might work on someone with extremely dry skin, harsh winters or maybe an older woman whose skin has lost some moisture and plumpness for hormonal reasons, but as a 31 year old with combination skin living in a mild climate [Southern California], this isn&#x27;t the right product.    </li>
      <li>Also, this product lasts a long time, it does not take much to apply all over your face and neck.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply, it&#x27;s not heavy with emollients, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>When I ran out of my Alba organics moisturizer, I decided to try something new, just because I like to try different products.  </li>
      <li>very luxurious product versus what you could pay for other products.</li>
      <li>I make sure to only put on a thin layer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m a gal in her mid 20s but I&#x27;ve always had problem with dry skin in the Winter. Back in my teens it would get so bad on my hands that they would crack and bleed (I know quite disgusting). Long story short my cousin got me a this Origins moisturizer and it&#x27;s the only thing that has worked for my extremely dry hands during the Winter. I highly recommend this and it&#x27;s quite soothing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people say it&#x27;s greasy and I have to somewhat agree with that so what I do is dip a tissue into the jar and then spread that onto my hands that way. It&#x27;s quite amazing how fast my hands are moisturized after using this product. It smells..interesting but not too overwhelming. It is expensive but like I said it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to work for my &amp;#34;Winter&amp;#34; hands. I&#x27;ve had this jar for quite some time now, I didn&#x27;t see an expiration date on it and it still seems to be in the same condition as when I first got it so it does last quite some time, at least for me.</li>
    <li> Feels great on your skin, moisturizes without feeling heavy, and smells great.</li>
    <li> I used Clinique for many years - thought I needed to switch to a product for older women so I chose Origins.  Suddenly began breaking out here and there and it lasted throughout the 6 weeks of using Origins.  Just switched back to Clinique and w/in just a week my face is clearing up and feels great!! Clinique is the best. I won&#x27;t switch again!</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the price. very luxurious product versus what you could pay for other products. highly  recommend you give it a try no harsh chemicals or fragrance</li>
    <li> I really like to mix up the moisturisers at night and this is one of the important ones in my rotation. It&#x27;s silky smooth and feels a little sticky when applied so I only use it at night. Does great things for my skin though..</li>
    <li> I use this product as a basic moisturizer at night after cleansing.  I don&#x27;t use this during the day as I think, for me, it leaves my skin shiner than I&#x27;d like for day use.  It may be a good day base for someone with dryer skin or in places where the air is dry during harsh winters.  I really like the smell and the fact that it has NOT made my skin break out.  I use this also after I have a chemical peel (which I do a couple times a month) and it has not given any adverse side effects as a result.  If anything, it seems to have reduced the amount of noticeable flaking that can occur with peels.  I have not noticed any obvious effects in terms of \\&quot;glowing skin\\&quot; or anything that would make it a \\&quot;can&#x27;t live without\\&quot; moisturizer.  But, it does do the job in terms of moisturizing and a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s a good basic moisturizer - it&#x27;s easy to apply, it&#x27;s not heavy with emollients, and a little goes a long way.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like I have a moisturizing mask on unless I get too heavy handed with it.  Personally I like it.</li>
    <li> My face now feels uncofortable if I do not use this product.  I put it on sometimes twice a day if the weather is dry.  It doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all.</li>
    <li> My skin is looking nicer each day I use it. It did take a few weeks to see the change. My fine lines are disapearing and my skin is smooth and glowing. Also, this product lasts a long time, it does not take much to apply all over your face and neck.  I use it now for over a year.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like it but it can be a little greasy for us combination-skin girls.  Just be sure to use a little and build up to the amount you will need.  A dime size should do it.</li>
    <li> I knew what I was getting when I ordered this product.  I worked for Origins for six months and this is a great moisturizer for combination skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have ever written for anything on amazon. I had to write about this because I love it so much. Any woman over 50 should be using this. (I am 51) I read about it in a magazine for skin care for women my age, bought it, and it is amazing what it has done for my skin. So much so that people have commented how nice my skin looks!!!&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have reduced any puffiness I&#x27;ve ever had. My skin was dry and is not anymore. It&#x27;s become beautiful and translucent. I use this twice a day. It&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I use to use Origins products and now I&#x27;m going back to Origins.  I love this moisturizer and also the night cream.</li>
    <li> ok, didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin (I am 40) that drugstore stuff didn&#x27;t already do. why do I have to write more - that is REALLY annoying !!! I just want to leave some simple feedback!!!</li>
    <li> this stuff is great, except for the smell.  it is way too strong.  If you don&#x27;t mind the overwhelming smell, you will like this.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, it absorbs well....but the smell!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years - love it.  I&#x27;m an Origins junkie - haven&#x27;t found one I don&#x27;t like</li>
    <li> This cream was expensive (for me) but was great on my face (65 yr old) it went on so smoothly and  felt heavenly on. Not to greasy, skin felt and looked smoother</li>
    <li> It took awhile to notice a difference in my skin but after a month I notice smoother skin with a more even tone.  I have less redness and my pores are smaller. I use this after cleansing with checks and balances from Origins. Love both products.</li>
    <li> When I ran out of my Alba organics moisturizer, I decided to try something new, just because I like to try different products.  Well, I remember A Perfect World on the Oprah show several years back.  It was on her \\&quot;Favorite Things\\&quot; episode and she was raving about it, so I decided to give it a whirl.    I have combination skin [oily nose/t-zone, dry patches on other areas of the face].  I tried this product and it is just too thick and heavy and greasy - feels like I&#x27;m smearing softened cream cheese on my face.  I gave it a fair trial [several weeks] and saw no imporvement in my skin.  I may as well have just put regular hand lotion on my face.      I can see how it might work on someone with extremely dry skin, harsh winters or maybe an older woman whose skin has lost some moisture and plumpness for hormonal reasons, but as a 31 year old with combination skin living in a mild climate [Southern California], this isn&#x27;t the right product.    What I HIGHLY recommend however is the Origins Balanced Diet lightweight moisturizer (which I use now).  It&#x27;s not too heavy, and it&#x27;s actually made my skin brighter.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but i was allergic to it.</li>
    <li> origins has always made good produts. I do wish they would make one that has no fragance. very soft on.</li>
    <li> feels too oily for my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 35 years old guy. Been using this product since 2001. This is the only moisturizer that works best for me and the only product my skin loves. I always go to Origins store or Macys to buy this. Not here on Amazon. This jar will last me about 6-8 months. One single application on your face will keep your face in good moisture up to 3 days in a very extreme winter season. Not like any other brands that costs way more that you have to reapply again and again to achieve that moisture your skin needs. I&#x27;d recommend this to any guys.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it can be a little greasy.  I make sure to only put on a thin layer.  It is a great combination for the acne soap that I use it balances it out the dryness.</li>
    <li> Have been using this cream in the winters for years and moisturizes dry skin beautifully.</li>
