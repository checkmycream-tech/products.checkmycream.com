<li> but now I can keep them on long enough to do fill ins!</li>
<li> I figured I&#x27;ve been getting them done for so long</li>
<li> I have tried other acrylic liquids that have not worked at all.  </li>
<li> I always had a problem with them popping off within a few days to a week</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> The bottle seems small but it has a small brush and only a very small amount is needed to coat the nail.</li>
<li> Very little lifting!</li>
<li> I can wear acrlyics again  Horrible allergy to other primers, make my nail lift completely, this product does the trick without the harmful chemicals.</li>
<li> I failed to do my research and now I&#x27;m stuck with something I don&#x27;t use.</li>
<li> As a pro- this primer is completely useless.</li>
<li> Use under gel base coat.</li>

    <li> As a pro- this primer is completely useless. Nails lifted within days regardless of application. Don&#x27;t buy it. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Excellent primer. Worth every penny. No lift with this primer!! CND PRODUCTS RULE!!</li>
    <li> I love this brand of primer.  It truly works.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Wrapped appropriately so it didn&#x27;t break. I was very happy about that. Did what it was supposed to do. Good product.</li>
    <li> Good product. Only used on a practice hand but so far so good! :) Goes with the CND powder kit</li>
    <li> It does its job. The bottle seems small but it has a small brush and only a very small amount is needed to coat the nail. I will re-purchase when I need it again, which will be a while.</li>
    <li> Great arrival time an great product.It works well with what the powder i use it with. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works well if you assiduously follow the directions and adhere to all hygienic protocol. As with any product, everything works if you follow manufacturer directions and use patience.</li>
    <li> Product was just as described and I really feel like this has helped nail polish and artifical nails stay on longer. I always had a problem with them popping off within a few days to a week but now I can keep them on long enough to do fill ins!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this product as several of my nails completely lifted from the nail bed approx 1 week after putting a new set of nails on...I have found a product now that has superior adhesion and costs much less.</li>
    <li> It does what It is suppose to do. Works really good. All in all it was a good buy. ♥ :-D</li>
    <li> Super Quality.The product is perfect. It works exactly the way I had hoped it would. I would certainly purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t typically made for under gels but it works great. Use under gel base coat. Stays for weeks</li>
    <li> I had acrylic nails done at a salon for years but I just didn&#x27;t want to pay the money anymore.  I figured I&#x27;ve been getting them done for so long I can do them myself.  I have tried other acrylic liquids that have not worked at all.  My nails lifted within 3 days and using Sassy Acrylic liquid in combination with Creative Nail Design Nail Prime Acid-Free Primer works like a charm.  2 weeks later and my nails have not lifted at all.  This is a great poduct.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is great if you want to ruin your actual nails. I failed to do my research and now I&#x27;m stuck with something I don&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Creative is an excellent acrylic line. This primer is great. I&#x27;ve been using this for many years.</li>
    <li> I used this under my shellac polish. Since I started I have not had any polish pull away from the nail or chip. I would fully recommend.</li>
    <li> I can wear acrlyics again  Horrible allergy to other primers, make my nail lift completely, this product does the trick without the harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Outperformed the Gelish primer by more than ten days.  Very little lifting!</li>
    <li> Perfect Primer. Use with CND Acrylic powder and Retention fluid. Great for bonding.</li>
