      <li>Works awesome!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very happy.</li>
      <li>Excellent results providing you apply correctly.</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely amazing!!</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>It is so wonderful to find a solution to hair removal that is also great for my skin.</li>
      <li>joy-</li>
      <li>I would say this is great for legs, stomach area, and bikini area.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>A great thing about this wax is that it&#x27;s washable and comparable to the non-water soluble waxes like one made by Parissa.</li>
      <li>But for the lip it works great.  </li>
      <li>Great product, it does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>Though it may work fine without this works best for me.</li>
      <li>this is good product  ...  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>Sugaring is so much better than waxing!</li>
      <li>It is painless, easy to wash off and very effective at removing hair.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>For touchups it is amazing, but the surface area of legs just make this product a joke.  </li>
      <li>And two nice features, everything washes out with water (strips, skin and sticks and the muslin strips are reusable.</li>
      <li>So, if you make your own sugar scrub at home and store it in this jar it&#x27;ll probably work well,</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t effective at all.</li>
      <li>Very easy to do and didn&#x27;t hurt like I thought it would.  </li>
      <li>Love the texture of the wax goes on nicely.</li>
      <li>i just test it and works great, at first i don&#x27;t understand how to use this, but than i read instructions and everything was as described</li>
      <li>but this was really easy to use and the product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Easy to warm up.  </li>
      <li>The strips are easily washable and reusable which I really liked.  </li>
      <li>The positive is that it does come off your skin very nice.....</li>
      <li>Gigi is much better.  </li>
      <li>Now it did work slightly better on my eyebrows which did have more than two weeks time to grow in.  </li>
      <li>I am getting better as I work on it)</li>
      <li>I will be buying more, I like this product.</li>
      <li>Will try again and update if it gets better.  </li>
      <li>This starter kit was perfect for me using sugaring to rid myself of leg hair as well as some facial hair.</li>
      <li>The most helpful review on here is the one by Zara on September 23, 2010.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t give you as many applicator sticks, though you can get those in bulk at a arts and crafts store.  </li>
      <li>and I just wished it worked better for me.</li>
      <li>Okay maybe one hair but how wasteful.</li>
      <li>I love that the wax dissolves so easily in water, it makes cleanup way easier.</li>
      <li>But it works fine, smells better than wax, and frankly the ease of cleanup alone has me sold.  </li>
      <li>Cleanup is so easy.</li>
      <li>Not as easy to use as I&#x27;d like, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt the face.</li>
      <li>I used it at room temperature, it works fine</li>
      <li>It picked up some really fine fuzzy hair</li>
      <li>Works well for longer, fine hair or for whatever length coarse/thicker hair.</li>
      <li>clean up is easy</li>
      <li>Easy to clean up.  </li>
      <li>chin has been baby smooth for days now!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Fun if your a masochist!</li>
      <li>I do use a pre-wax cleanser still as it seems to help clean the skin and make the hair removal easier.</li>
      <li>I washed mine but after a while you just want some clean ones.</li>
      <li>After reading such good reviews about it, I just had to try it.</li>
      <li>your not going to wait 2 weeks for full growth before doing this.  </li>
      <li>it actually is really that easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate; leaves it nice and smooth; and my favorite feature is that their fabric strips are reusable so the kit lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>It did clean up well and at the price I am not angry</li>
      <li>and I rarely have to use tweezers for any stray hairs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other than that, I love the fact that it is all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
      <li>I applied it slightly warm, and followed the directions provided by moom.&lt;br /&gt;Apply this with the direction of the hair growth and remove (very fast and quickly rip off strip) in opposite direction of hair growth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t have high hopes that this product would be any better than others I tried, but it certainly is</li>
      <li>It says not to warm it up for facial hair, which I am glad because I have used that kind of product in the past</li>
      <li>However, there is nothing special about this, you&#x27;re better off buying cheaper wax from a store it will do the same thing.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s hit-or-miss getting it to the right temperature.  </li>
      <li>The Moom is easily rinsed off of both the muslin and your skin with plain warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have very blonde very fine hairs</li>
      <li>In fact it leaves my skin silky smooth and very soft, and I&#x27;m already finding the grow-back time to be lengthening.</li>
      <li>a lot less headache than having to use a special oil to remove it, along with the fact that oil causes its own</li>
      <li>Good for the bikini area but a little patchy on the legs.</li>
      <li>I was really nervous to try (what if I swiped a whole eye brow off??!!)</li>
      <li>It is very gentle on the skin and it leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Thanks Moom!</li>
      <li>Works exactly like it states.  </li>
      <li>I just finished using this product on my legs, and overall, I like it and intend to purchase more of the sugar goop.  </li>
      <li>This review is written on my first use.  </li>
      <li>This is the first product that has not irritated my skin.</li>
      <li>after the first use i was in LOVE, after the second use i was in AGONY....</li>
      <li>so I found if I put it on the applicator and then blast it with my hair dryer, it softens it enough to make it more spreadable without getting it too hot.  </li>
      <li>For a first time user, I&#x27;m sold on this product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>yet I was still having trouble with getting a good application and removal.</li>
      <li>I like that you can reuse the strips rather than generating all the trash, and it really does wash right off both the strips and anything else it gets on.</li>
      <li>In my experience, washable waxes tend to be 50% less effective than the non-washable waxes, but this is not the case with Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty easy to use and usually not messy although sticky.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is also a large quantity of muslin that comes with the kit</li>
      <li>No more pain, just smooth soft and amazing skin.</li>
      <li>product really works well.  </li>
      <li>Yes, if you don&#x27;t have much experience waxing, it can take some time to get the hang of it.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do the job very well.</li>
      <li>worked very well.</li>
      <li>it was really yummy</li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>I bought this specifically to wax my lip, but I tried it on my eyebrows on time and didn&#x27;t have much luck.  </li>
      <li>I do it right before bed in case there is any unexpected redness though.</li>
      <li>I am familiar with threading and traditional waxing methods for hair removal.</li>
      <li>But, for touchups an small areas, like armpits, it is amazing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Reusable strips are decent.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very surprised at how reasonably priced it is.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had tried to make my own sugar paste before, and I failed 5 times. I have gotten sugared a couple of times professionally before, and while I LOVED the results, it is super expensive. Because of this, I purchased wax for myself a couple of months ago, and broke out in a horrible mess in my bikini area. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured that at less than $20, I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose with Moom (pro sugaring would have cost me about $70).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t gotten completely hairless results yet (beginners curve- I am getting better as I work on it), I am AMAZED at how much less it hurts than the waxing did. The most discomfort I had was in actually applying Moom, as the hair is more sensitive down there, and pulling it with &amp;#34;taffy&amp;#34; basically is uncomfortable to apply. However, it doesn&#x27;t even feel that painful to pull it off. Trust me, I braced myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> In an effort to save money I decided I could start doing waxing &amp;#34;in house&amp;#34;.  I was really nervous to try (what if I swiped a whole eye brow off??!!) but this was really easy to use and the product is amazing.  It really does just wash off if you get it in a place you didn&#x27;t mean too.  Def don&#x27;t over microwave when you heat up...a few seconds goes a long way.  The strips are easily washable and reusable which I really liked.  Order extra wood tips though.  I washed mine but after a while you just want some clean ones.</li>
    <li> It seriously took me 15 strips to get 1/2 the hair off of my chin.  And it&#x27;s not because I have a ton of hair either.  I waited as long as I could as the packaging suggests but let&#x27;s face it-your not going to wait 2 weeks for full growth before doing this.  I have very blonde very fine hairs and it just couldn&#x27;t grasp them in the wax.  For every 10 strips I did 3 would get some hair.  Now it did work slightly better on my eyebrows which did have more than two weeks time to grow in.  But again, for using 5 strips on each 3 pulled hair.  This review is written on my first use.  Will try again and update if it gets better.  The positive is that it does come off your skin very nice.....just no hair in it!</li>
    <li> l just use (bought) this wax for my mustache, l am 38 and l have removed with wax my mustache for over 20 years, so the hair is already thin and grows slowly, so l just have to remove it around every 2 months. Anyway, l was looking for a wax that removes hair from root (you know that after removal you can see and feel your skin really shaved with a good wax), so what happened with this wax is a horrible result: Number one, it does not remove the hair at all, number two, due to the very poor quality l think l paid a lot of money for this kit, NUMBER THREE: l have waxed 3 times since l received it and my hair in my mustache still feels there!&lt;br /&gt;PLS DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY</li>
    <li> Works exactly like it states.  Just have to grin and bear it as you rip the hairs off your body.  Fun if your a masochist!</li>
    <li> I just finished using this product on my legs, and overall, I like it and intend to purchase more of the sugar goop.  Forget microwaving--that was a nuisance since it cools down rather rapidly and makes it hard to spread (just like wax).  A water bath is the way to go. I&#x27;m also clearly not as skilled as some other reviewers, since I need more just to finish my legs.  I am rather out of practice, though.  I&#x27;m also going to buy a few more strips; I would have welcomed a few more so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about using every last inch of each strip.  But it works fine, smells better than wax, and frankly the ease of cleanup alone has me sold.  I like that you can reuse the strips rather than generating all the trash, and it really does wash right off both the strips and anything else it gets on.</li>
    <li> Amazing! i have THICK COARSE facial hair and MOOM kit takes care of it! Be careful to only put a thin layer on.</li>
    <li> after the first use i was in LOVE, after the second use i was in AGONY....it lost its strength i feel like. The jar can be reheated, but i don&#x27;t think it should be since i feel like the wax didn&#x27;t withstand the reheating. What a shame</li>
    <li> Did not work at all.  It did not spread on any parcel of skin...heated or not. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  Not only does it spell out how to use it - idiot proof - it actually is really that easy to use.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate; leaves it nice and smooth; and my favorite feature is that their fabric strips are reusable so the kit lasts a long time.  They don&#x27;t give you as many applicator sticks, though you can get those in bulk at a arts and crafts store.  Just one last thing to note: the hairs you are removing should be the length the instructions tell you to have it.  It won&#x27;t be effective on super tiny hairs or stubble as those hairs are thick and stubborn to remove at that stage in growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I decided to try to use this product to wax my legs and it went less than well.  For touchups it is amazing, but the surface area of legs just make this product a joke.  Even spreading a very thin layer it wouldn&#x27;t cover all of them.  So, if you make your own sugar scrub at home and store it in this jar it&#x27;ll probably work well, but otherwise it&#x27;s not worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the hair grows back within three weeks.  Nicer than shaving, but not worth the cost.  But, for touchups an small areas, like armpits, it is amazing.</li>
    <li> Gigi is much better.  This doesn&#x27;t solidify enough and stays gooy so not all the hair is pulled off.  I&#x27;ve been waxing for over 10 years and this was just not effective.</li>
    <li> The most helpful review on here is the one by Zara on September 23, 2010.  I followed Zara&#x27;s guidelines on spreading the wax on the cloth, etc and it made a big difference in effectiveness and pain management.  I love that the wax dissolves so easily in water, it makes cleanup way easier.</li>
    <li> After reading countless reviews I decided to buy this. Normally I just thread my facial hair but I wanted something that would last longer. Even after completely letting my facial hair and walking around looking like a complete lunatic the wax would not stick and barely removed any hair. I gave it an extra star because I really like the fact that the strips are washable. However, there is nothing special about this, you&#x27;re better off buying cheaper wax from a store it will do the same thing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use wax. I don&#x27;t wax anything but my eyebrows. So, when I did research this and read that people were saying it was painless - and tried it just to find out it wasn&#x27;t. I wasn&#x27;t very happy. I used it one time a few weeks ago. Not sure if I have the guts to suvk up the pain and use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love the fact that it is all natural ingredients. I actually put a tiny amount in my mouth and to my amazement it was really yummy lol</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t fault this product. It is painless, easy to wash off and very effective at removing hair. I used it at room temperature, it works fine but it takes a little more effort to spread the wax. If you&#x27;re getting a wax kit for the very first time, look no further!</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically to wax my lip, but I tried it on my eyebrows on time and didn&#x27;t have much luck.  However, I am not blaming the product, it may have been because I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing, I usually pluck my eyebrows.  But for the lip it works great.  Easy to clean up.  Easy to warm up.  Just pop it in the microwave and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I really like this. Cleanup is so easy. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that much relative to actual waxing. For the price, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Works awesome!</li>
    <li> I have been using this kit since April 2011.  No trouble using the product, and I was able to give myself an extreme bikini wax using the heat from the initial warming of the wax.  I recommend only waxing half inch by one inch sections at a time.  The hair comes out easier now with each wax and I rarely have to use tweezers for any stray hairs. I was skeptical at first, because I have coarse black hair, but I am happy to say that if you use the product correctly, the results are phenomenal every time.</li>
    <li> Not as easy to use as I&#x27;d like, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt the face. Excellent results providing you apply correctly. Overall I really like it, and have recommended it to a couple of my friends. It leaves skin soft, rather than red and sticky, and I have very sensitive skin. I do it right before bed in case there is any unexpected redness though.</li>
    <li> This product was extremely messy and I bruised after using it. I am one of those people that follows all of the recommended directions and yet I was still having trouble with getting a good application and removal. The scene in my bathroom was something to behold. I gave it 2 stars because I think any product that&#x27;s natural deserves some credit.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing!! After reading such good reviews about it, I just had to try it. The waxing method is extremely painful and shaving is a complete waste. I just got my MOOM today and I had to try it instantly. It is very gentle on the skin and it leaves it soft and smooth. It is less painful than I thought and does not hurt when using for the bikini line. For a first time user, I&#x27;m sold on this product and will continue to use it. IT WORKS! No more pain, just smooth soft and amazing skin. Where has MOOM been all my life?!!</li>
    <li> The product says if the hairs come right back you missed them.  Then how come my hair was growing back in 7 days or less?  Plus I cannot remove leg hair at all.  To be fair, my hair is very thin so maybe its having a hard time grabbing it.  Trust me, I tried every direction possible and could only get a few hairs at a time.  It would take me forever to remove my leg hairs using this product.  I let my hair grow for weeks and that didn&#x27;t help either.&lt;br /&gt;The clean up is easy and I just wished it worked better for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, it does not irritate my skin at all. In fact it leaves my skin silky smooth and very soft, and I&#x27;m already finding the grow-back time to be lengthening.</li>
    <li> this is good product  ...  i just test it and works great, at first i don&#x27;t understand how to use this, but than i read instructions and everything was as described</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Yes, if you don&#x27;t have much experience waxing, it can take some time to get the hang of it.  But I highly recommend it.  If you apply wax to small sections and pull the wax strip away in the opposite direction of hair growth - you&#x27;ll have a better experience.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this product yet.  Hopefully will be easy to use and not be too messy or get too hard too fast when it cools.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of these and if this doesn&#x27;t work i&#x27;ll try something else</li>
    <li> Sugaring is so much better than waxing! I could tell right away that it was only lifting up the hair and not taking a layer of skin like waxing used to do for me. It is so wonderful to find a solution to hair removal that is also great for my skin. This starter kit was perfect for me using sugaring to rid myself of leg hair as well as some facial hair. I do use a pre-wax cleanser still as it seems to help clean the skin and make the hair removal easier. Though it may work fine without this works best for me. I have fairly coarse dark hair so I get really sick of shaving, it grows back within two days of shaving and gives me ingrown hairs -oh joy- With sugaring I get all the benefits of waxing without the drawbacks! Thanks Moom!</li>
    <li> I have received professional waxes for a few years but I decided to try it out on myself. The wax wipes off with a wet cloth, the strips that are provided are washable and reusable. I will but again.</li>
    <li> I needed this to remove coarse and stubborn hairs from my chin area.&lt;br /&gt;This worked very well. I applied it slightly warm, and followed the directions provided by moom.&lt;br /&gt;Apply this with the direction of the hair growth and remove (very fast and quickly rip off strip) in opposite direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;My chin has been baby smooth for days now!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to other ladies, and will reorder another jar soon.</li>
    <li> I am familiar with threading and traditional waxing methods for hair removal. I got it specifically for my upper lips but it didn&#x27;t work. It picked up some really fine fuzzy hair but it wasn&#x27;t effective at all. I tried it a couple of times thinking that may be the first time around, the length of the hair might have been too short. But no luck. I like that its all natural but no point if it doesn&#x27;t work. I think I will just have to resort to threading for the time being. May be it just didn&#x27;t work for me. It is not as messy as the traditional wax. I would say try a small sample if you really want to before you buy the kit like I did.</li>
    <li> This is the first product that has not irritated my skin. The washable strips do get very wrinkly and need ironed to be used again properly.</li>
    <li> I like the product its not hard to use and following tips from other reviews was helpful. I definitely prefer it to chemical products that burn the skin . It left my skin soft , there was only minor discomfort , and no skin damage. I would definitely recommend it. The only disappointment was the hard plastic box with sharp edges. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would package a natural product in a plastic box. If it hadn&#x27;t been for the box I would have given the product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff hurts to pull off and it doesn&#x27;t even get all the hairs out.  Also it leaves sticky stuff all over my legs.</li>
    <li> Very easy to do and didn&#x27;t hurt like I thought it would.  I am definately going to use it again.</li>
    <li> This hurt and it simply did not remove my hair.  I would rip, and it would hurt and I would look at the strip and there would be two or three hairs on it. I followed the directions to a tee, and even used the video demonstration on their website.  It did clean up well and at the price I am not angry I just wouldn&#x27;t buy again, because I don&#x27;t need pain without gain.</li>
    <li> Love the texture of the wax goes on nicely. I had a hard time removing all hairs. I would say this is great for legs, stomach area, and bikini area. I had trouble with removing facial hair with it. I will be buying more, I like this product. I would get a wax warmer to stop the several trips back to the microwave. I would just be careful not to over heat it will ruin the product and you could burn yourself. Mrs. Angelina Graziano</li>
    <li> I always had facial hair but after menopause, the growth increased and hair became thicker.  Unfortunately, I tried everything on the market, wax, depilatories and bleach...nothing worked. Going to the salon is an added expense and if you find yourself in need of a touch up or can&#x27;t get to the salon, even more frustrating.  On the recommendation of someone else who reviewed this product,she mentioned she was of middle eastern descent.  A second generation American, my genes still make my hair dark, coarse, thick and resistant.  And my &amp;#34;girly skills&amp;#34; at the low end of the ability spectrum!&lt;br /&gt;So  I purchased it and boy was I pleasantly surprised. Read the directions all the way through and take your time.  You don&#x27;t need to heat the Moom for your face...but it is like anything new, you need to try it out. It took me a a hour or more to shape my brows, but they were in bad shape, and remember no &amp;#34;girly skills.&amp;#34;  My only recommendations: a little goes a long way, take a little on the stick and spread it in a thin layer. And two nice features, everything washes out with water (strips, skin and sticks and the muslin strips are reusable.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice since I received it.  I use it for facial hair only.  It seems to be the exact same product that the beauty salons use.  I have used the wax strips that you can buy at the drug store but they are so ineffectual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really works well.  When you are done, you cannot feel any hair on your face where you used it for several days--your skin is COMPLETELY smooth and you don&#x27;t need to use it near as often as the aforementioned wax strips.  It says not to warm it up for facial hair, which I am glad because I have used that kind of product in the past and it&#x27;s hit-or-miss getting it to the right temperature.  However, it is rather thick and is a little hard to spread sometime so I found if I put it on the applicator and then blast it with my hair dryer, it softens it enough to make it more spreadable without getting it too hot.  I find it easiest to do small areas at a time--maybe 3 to 5 areas across the upper lip.  It does not leave my skin red or irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a large quantity of muslin that comes with the kit and it is reusable.  The Moom is easily rinsed off of both the muslin and your skin with plain warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have high hopes that this product would be any better than others I tried, but it certainly is and I&#x27;m very surprised at how reasonably priced it is.  If you are using just for the face, the jar will last a long, long time.  Considering that the salons in my area charge $10 for EACH area of the face, it is a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works well for longer, fine hair or for whatever length coarse/thicker hair. Good for the bikini area but a little patchy on the legs. A great thing about this wax is that it&#x27;s washable and comparable to the non-water soluble waxes like one made by Parissa. In my experience, washable waxes tend to be 50% less effective than the non-washable waxes, but this is not the case with Moom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty easy to use and usually not messy although sticky. And if you do make a mess, i.e., drop some on the counter, it is easy to wipe off with a moist towel-- a lot less headache than having to use a special oil to remove it, along with the fact that oil causes its own mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely slower than shaving, but the advantage is that hair will take longer to grow back and it tends to be finer. It is worth the initial time investment for me, but if I need to run to something in like 30 min and realize my legs have been unkempt, I would grab for the razor. Unless you become a waxing pro and can finish it all in 5 min, but I haven&#x27;t gotten to that point and probably not soon. Waxing the underarm area is a bit of a chore b/c you need to use talcum powder to dry the area. If you simply slather the wax on bare skin, it doesn&#x27;t pull off any hair. Okay maybe one hair but how wasteful. Mind that powder is needed just for the underarm area. Other areas are fine without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reusable strips are decent. I wash &amp; reuse them about twice. But even after the first wash, the edges of strips start to fray &amp; shed little bamboo fibers-- an annoyance.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t work quite as well as expected.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job very well.</li>
