<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my go to lotion and, yes, it really does last 24 hours as long as it&#x27;s not washed off.  Skin is soft and flakes are gone and it is absorbed very quickly.</li>
    <li> The head of the bottle is broken, affecting the use.&lt;br /&gt;It is more moisture to my skin, but because the cap is broken, I do not often use to it.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with dry skin, and I now work a job where my hands get dirty and wet frequently throughout the day. It can be agony. Palmers is, hands-down the best thing ever. Putting it on is instantly relieving. It absorbs quickly, is never sticky, smells great and is like no other lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, regardless of price.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and smell. It stays on all day. Very moisturizing</li>
    <li> It smells good but I don&#x27;t see a difference on my stench marks! How sad :(! But I love the smell!</li>
    <li> Finding the pump in Palmer&#x27;s is not all that easy. I was so happy to find it here. I LOVE Palmer&#x27;s! I works great all over for me. I have rosacea and it has done wonders for that area on my face. My body skin looks amazing with Palmer&#x27;s. Plus, you smell yummy like cocoa.</li>
    <li> This is GREAT for dry skin, I like the smell, I&#x27;m super soft and I THINK my stretchmarks are disappearing a bit. My reason for no 5th star is it&#x27;s NOT non-comedogenic and I occasionally break out from it. Good for winter months, though.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer for the money you can buy. Found this ones cheaper at Walmart though so probably will get it there next. Has a good smell&lt;br /&gt;and keeps my skin moist all day even in the winter. I use their soap as well which is equally good.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful, and helped with some visible stretch marks on my thighs. I usually use right after I shower, and the smell is chocolatey and smells so good. I also apply at night to my face, and my face is is so soft in the morning! Totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A good accompaniment to the Palmer&#x27;s balm formula! With regular use, your skin gets the feeling of healing. I am so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> After doing some research, I settled on cocoa butter as the main moisturizing product to use to combat dry skin on my elbows. I guess my skin had never experienced a winter as dry as this last one, as my elbows became really scaly devoid of all moisture pretty early on in the season. Thanks to some exfoliating soap and some Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter, my arms feel as soft as a baby and smell like Venezuela - and it literally only took, at most, 2 weeks. Very glad I decided to try this product. It has a pretty strong buttery smell, but trust me... it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged Irish Scottish Male and we need cream for our dry skin. This does the trick.</li>
    <li> No, it doesn&#x27;t taste like chocolate.. (don&#x27;t ask me how i know this)..  But it has a nice cocoa smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite lotion, and i can even use it on my face without irritation or breakout.  Feels great after a shower or after being in the sun.  Makes my skin very soft but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a way to enjoy chocolate that doesn&#x27;t make my butt big!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff! it works really well to fade my stretch marks, i noticed a difference really fast. even though i noticed a difference, it was small, so it does take some time to work on your stretch marks. i would say the only downsides are the price and the smell. i cant stand the smell but i want a  beautiful tummy:)</li>
    <li> I would love to have used this product (hence the 3 star review), because the aroma is wonderful, but unable to get the pump to produce product.  This could be due to the viscosity.  It is VERY thick.  I had to return it for credit.</li>
    <li> I have systemic Lupus and Lupus actually destroys the collagen in your body.  In addition, I am 63 and have spent my entire life on a ranch out in the sun and wind.  This product works great!  I had dry, cracked and bleeding fingertips and heels and along with a Ped Egg to remove the dry, dead skin, my fingers and heels are now crack-free.  I bought this along with  Desert Essence Hand and Body Lotion Coconut and honestly, it was virtually a tie and both products worked miracles.  (I like the smell of the other one a little better.)  Apply three times a day or after having your hands in water.  I use it on the rest of my body also but primarily bought it for feet and hands.  I highly recommend this product and the price is great.  I have spent WAY more money on lotions and creams and usually, I was disappointed. Not this time!</li>
    <li> I saw an advertisement for Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter lotion in Teen Vogue and decided to give it a try. My hands are constantly dry so I&#x27;m always looking for deep moisturizing lotion. I am very satisfied with this product! You don&#x27;t have to use very much of the lotion because it spreads very well. It rubs all the way in without feeling greasy. And the best part is that it smells like CHOCOLATE! It leaves skin baby soft. This lotion claims that it can even skintone and diminish blemishes, but I cannot attest to those claims because I have mostly been using this lotion on my hands. All in all, I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it smelled like chocolate.  Very strongly like chocolate. I only use it as hand lotion. Also I found it at woodmans for waaaay cheaper. The product itself it very thick and creamy and hydrating</li>
    <li> This lotion is absorbed quickly into the skin, has just a subtle smell of cocoa, and makes your skin feel smooth and moisturized. I can&#x27;t comment on the longterm effects yet, but I am optimistic that I&#x27;ll see some permanent change in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. My hands were extremely dry, and it took care of it after one use. It seems a little thick, but absorbs in less than a minute and keeps hands soft for hours. Just a hint of fragrance, nothing overpowering. Works better than anything else I have used.</li>
    <li> Use this as my after-shower lotion. Works good and smells great!! Skin feels great!</li>
    <li> They have changed the formula and this caused an allergic reaction. Never using this again unless they change it back to the original ingredients.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Non greasy.</li>
    <li> They stopped carrying this in the store near my house, but I love this lotion. Some other brands are watery and don&#x27;t really last long, but Palmers is thick, rich, and smells like chocolate. Just like my men.</li>
    <li> Really love this product! It makes your skin feel soft and moisturized. This lotion isn&#x27;t heavy duty or greasy which is always a plus. The smell is another added bonus!</li>
    <li> Not only does Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter lotion feel great on your skin, but the scent is wonderful!  It smooths out your dry skin and the moisturizing effect lasts a good while, a huge bonus in dry winter months or in an office setting where the air is dry and you work with paper a lot.  You don&#x27;t need a lot to get your hands feeling good again, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or oily residue on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!  It definitely reminds you of both cocoa and butter, both in smell and feel.  I just think that the bottle shouldn&#x27;t be plain white, but some in some rich brown-gold color...because that&#x27;s what it feels like on your skin.</li>
    <li> I like use their lotion, it&#x27;s very soft and not feel oil. sometimes you buy lotion or cream is let you feel uncomfortable, but they don&#x27;t. and very helpful for your dry skin.</li>
    <li> Been getting DARK for an upcoming cruise at the tanning and salon and use Palmers Cocoa Butter w/ VIT E as an after tan moisturizer. It works very well. Seems like it really penetrates deep to lock in moisture. The smell is also very delicious...like another reviewer stated...it really does smell like Vanilla Wafers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few moths and I really like it. I use it primary for hands, is good because it lasts a long time and maintain your skin soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is a treat for both my skin and my nostrils!  Rich, creamy, and wonderful smell.  It&#x27;s helping keep my dry, cracked hands under control.  And best of all, no animal testing.</li>
    <li> Nice chcolate smell, good feeling on my skin. I&#x27;ll buy it again. Good for dry skin especially during winter tho I don&#x27;t have a dry skin it makes my skin feel softer.</li>
    <li> My wife used this every night on her belly all throughout pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. She loved it. Plus it smells really good.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Walmart because I was too impatient to wait for a few days for it to come in the mail.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I was afraid that it would cause my skin to get itchy like most lotions because it is scented.  However, it caused absolutely no irritation at all.  The scent is mild and pleasant.  The lotion is thick and creamy and relieves my dry skin all day.  It makes me smell very good.  The bottle is very big and the price is nice compared to similar size lotions in other brands.  I will be buying this again and again.</li>
    <li> it smells so good and really smooths made my stretch marks slowly fade away and good for scars too i really really recommend it!!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this pump version in this pregnancy &amp; is very happy with the product. We previously had the bottle top version and couldn&#x27;t get through almost 1/4 of the cream which stays due to its thick consistency.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to help combat pregnancy stretchmarks.  No stretch marks and skin seems much more toned and even too.  You will smell like a chocolate bar, just a warning.</li>
    <li> I love cocoa butted and i have since it was only a round tub,the cream will leave your skin feeling soft and shiny,it helps with stretch marks as well as eczema.</li>
    <li> I used to love this stuff and used it many years ago when I was young and pregnant. I don&#x27;t know if the formula was changed or if I have become used to non-fragrant lotions. I recently bought two of these as add-ons. The smell was way too strong for me. I put both bottles in my office and my co-workers now use it. I&#x27;ll stick to my unscented Kukui Oil- which I love!</li>
    <li> Now I will admit right away that I must have wonderful genes because I have great complexion and nice skin. With my first baby I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark, and while I know some of that is just gonna happen or not, I helped the process along by 1. not gaining a ridiculous amount of weight and 2. using cocoa butter lotion every night on my belly, upper thighs, and breasts. I used it in 2011 and now I am using another bottle with my current pregnancy; I would estimate that I use 2 bottles per pregnancy - also including touch-ups on my elbows, arms, and legs during the day. The consistency is a LITTLE greasy, but it&#x27;s not bad and it didn&#x27;t stop me from using it right before bed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is heavenly. I had noticed some patches of discolored/dry skin forming on my back and stomach that my usual moisturizer could not eliminate, so my doctor recommended Palmer&#x27;s for evening out my skin. All I can say is WOW. This stuff is deeply moisturizing. The texture is super-rich and creamy, and it leaves my skin feeling and looking like silk -- even after one use I noticed that my skin was a lot softer and more even-toned. The smell is also very pleasant, chocolately without being too sweet. I will definitely be buying more of this!</li>
    <li> you can never go wrong with this lotion. the smell and how it works wonders for the texture of your skin. i love it!</li>
    <li> I have natural curly dry hair and decided this stuff isn&#x27;t as greasy as my regular hair creams..So, I tried it and been using it about a week on my hair and dang, it&#x27;s different, but in a great way!!!  My favorite moisturizer for skin and now my favorite hair cream.  So much cheaper than the overpriced hair products that I&#x27;ve been using!!!  My skin and hair never looked healthier!!!</li>
    <li> Great lotion with a very nice scent. the scent reminds me of the smell of hot chocolate.</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter works wonders! It takes awhile to dry on my skin so I usually only put it on once a day. I was still surprised by the quick results. Within a month I could barely see my stretch marks, which were on my inner thighs, love handles, side boobs, and arms. I forgot to use it for a couple months during a move/transition period, but once I picked it back up for a couple weeks the stretch marks are gone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that continuously buys hand creams and lotions. I usually end up using one for a week and then I stop. This one has completely changed that. I use this stuff on my hands and it makes them so soft. It smells great and it really can heal dry skin on your hands. I have extremely dry cuticles and after just one application they look hydrated and smooth all day long. I love it!</li>
    <li> great value. my husband likes cocoa butter and would normally pay more in stores.. good for the skin ….well he likes it i prefer other lotions</li>
    <li> I discovered Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter over 10 years ago when I read that it could help with stretch marks. I quickly switched to the lotion, since the solid butter can get really greasy. This lotion is amazing and smells delicious. I am always complemented for smelling like cookies when I wear it and nothing else. It also hydrates my skin better than other lotions that I have used. (I do sometimes switch to an Aveno lotion to keep my skin from building up an addiction to any one lotion&#x27;s moisturizers.) In hot and humid weather, it can be a little thick, but 9-10 months out of the year, this is my lotion of choice.</li>
    <li> Great product for any skin problem, and I love the smell of of Cocoa butter.  Must try and you will be hooked</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Keeps your moisturized for longer than regular hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;-Pleasant, non-overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Can be difficult to pump, as the pumping nozzle twists to open/close oddly.&lt;br /&gt;- Not as natural as you may assume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list reads like regular hand lotion -- lots of chemicals and very little actual cocoa butter. This is not a Cocoa butter based lotion, but rather a good lotion with a little Cocoa butter in it. Just be warned.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells nothing like the same brand palmers cocoa butter in the small tub. So disappointing. And its too thick to even use with the pump. I have to unscrew it and dump it out from the bottle. Its a giant pain in the ass and not worth the hassle. NEVER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I thought I could not go wrong with a cocoa butter, but this one smells like a Hersey bar.  You would think that is not a problem if you like chocolate, but it was too much, I ended up getting the Vaseline cocoa radiant and like it much better.  If a strong chocolate scent is what you want, this will work…  If not, check out the Vaseline version.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this in an attempt to keep the skin on my hand from cracking during the dry weather in California. I&#x27;ve tried other lotions in the past that claimed to heal and soften dry skin. None of those products worked and the result was oily, dry hands with cracks so deep they would bleed. I had given up hope when I saw this and decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;m so glad I did! Not only doe it smell amazing, but it does what the bottle claims! When I received this I had one very deep crack in my hand on the webbing next to my thumb, but within 1 day of using it I noticed that I could use my hands as I normally would and the crack would not start to bleed like it normally would. The crack was completely healed in less than a week! I was completely amazed! After seeing how well the product helped my extremely dry hands, my mother and grandmother started using this lotion as well. While my mother&#x27;s hands do not crack, the skin gets dry and flakes off. The Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter has prevented that from the day she started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is worth the money you pay for it. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands oily as some lotions do and it smells AMAZING, which is just a bonus. I highly recommend this product to anyone that suffers from extremely dry skin, or to anyone that is looking for a lotion that smells nice and is good for your skin!</li>
    <li> Just leave my skin the refresh and smooth, just the way I want it.&lt;br /&gt;No dislike and will recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> works like a dream and you smell good too!</li>
    <li> I gave one to a friend and now she is going on line and getting some and more of the other products.</li>
    <li> If no one has tried this and has super dry skin like mine... You will definitely notice having softer skin in no time. I have used this product for many years. Stick to the original lotion without all the other junk that comes in it.</li>
    <li> I 1st used this product in college and I instantly LOVED it!!Very rich and moisturizing without the greasy texture. Easily absorbed by the skin and the smell is fantastic. I&#x27;m sticking with this lotion FOREVER. P.S. this is made with no harmful chemicals for happy skin.</li>
    <li> I am 18 years old, and all my life, I have always been the above average weight kind of girl. It wasnt until last year that I decided to change that. I found out that you get stretch marks while gaining and LOSING weight. I decided to use this, because it has COCOA BUTTER, let me tell you, this stuff REALLY WORKS!!! If you religiously apply this product on your problem areas, I applied it to myself at least twice a day, you will get the results you deserve!!! It faded my stretch my dark stretch marks after a couple of weeks. You definitely see results. As for the white silvery stretch marks, not so good, for that is usually the later stages of stretch marks, and it usually means, dead end. Lastly the smell, every time I use this and sit next to my brother who is very straight forward, he asks me if I was eating chocolate -.- yes it has a chocolate kind of scent to it, but duhhhh, it&#x27;s cocoa butter. I don&#x27;t mind it to be honest. I just want to say this product will always stay in my dresser. For years and years to come!! :D</li>
    <li> Best lotion on market. Smells good and not overly grease. Great for after sun and maintaining your tan. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is really good lotion for dry skin, and for itchy pregnancy skin and prevention of stretch marks.  I would recommend it and buy it again.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has extremely dry skin that flakes when not heavily moisturized.  We tried switching to the Vaseline cocoa butter to save money and it was of no comparison. We quickly went back to Palmer&#x27;s. It leaves his skin smooth and moisturized for days!  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I use this to keep calloused skin on my feet from cracking and dry skin from flaking.&lt;br /&gt;It works.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! One of the best body lotions ever! This body lotion makes my skin look more toned and glowy! I have some dark spots and scars and I see them slowly fading away with this body lotion, along with exfoliating. You have to be consistent with this for the product to work. I also love the smell! It has a rich cocoa scent and it smells so sweet and chocolatey! The product is very thick and I only ever use this at night time because of how thick it is. It feels and looks like butter. It leaves skin with a nice sheen, but not oily or greasy! Highly reccommend it</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by a friend and found that it was better for me and really helped with the dry skin.</li>
    <li> When I was a kid I would pick at my legs a lot and scratch them like crazy. As a result my legs were horribly scarred and other kids made fun of me for it. Even adults always asked my why my legs were so ugly. So one of my aunts once gave me a tube of this cream. I used it for one or two months and my scars were practucally gone. I swear by this thing. Even though I dont need to use it all the time, I always have a bottle.</li>
    <li> The only body lotion I use. Love it!</li>
    <li> The cream smells great (like chocolate!) and keeps my skin feeling great despite all the cold weather this season. Definitely going to continue using Palmer&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I love this so much and can only ever find it in the store as a travel size, so getting this at such a great price was a wonderful deal. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it does not dispense very well... sometimes, even though it&#x27;s unlocked, it will get stuck and I have to fiddle with it to get it to dispense, and even when it does it does not dispense much and I have to press it multiple times to get enough. Those are only minor things to deal with though, and worth it for such a great product!</li>
    <li> I have a very significant problem with dry skin -- chapped hands and lips, cracked fingers -- and this is the most helpful product I&#x27;ve ever found.  I have been using it for years.  But I have trouble finding it locally, especially in this more economical large container.  So I was glad to find it available from Amazon.</li>
    <li> The only lotion I buy! This stuff is amazing. I have sensitive skin, and this is calming, makes my skin feel softer and smoother than anything I&#x27;ve used, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. A staple in my beauty routine, for sure!</li>
    <li> I have used this for both pregnancies to try to prevent stretch marks… I didn&#x27;t get any with the first kiddo; not sure if it had to do with this product or not, but I am going for it this time around as well, just in case! :) Smells good, too.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a classic and is always a great choice.  I LOVE Palmer&#x27;s lotion, especially on the dry, brutal winters.</li>
    <li> I used this with my first pregnancy and now my second. I got a lot of stretch marks when I was younger and hit growth spurts and my mother and sister got stretch marks from pregnancy so I thought I was doomed. I slathered it on 1-2 times per day and never got a stretch mark. It could be luck or it could be the lotion. Either way, I&#x27;m sticking with it. It&#x27;s very thick and moisturizing which is nice and I think the smell is pretty subtle and fades fast so you don&#x27;t smell like it all day. It&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
    <li> Smooth feel that does what it says it will do. Only thing I hate is the smell of the lotion, but that is just a minor complaint.</li>
    <li> I put this stuff on every night before I go to bed. I have an athletic build and it really gives my arms and shoulders a nice shine. Not a huge fan of the smell but i&#x27;ll sacrifice for the feel it gives my skin afterwards.</li>
    <li> For the dry Colorado climate, I love this lotion. I use it on problem areas, but all over as well.</li>
    <li> The lotion is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for my stretch marks that developed during my pregnancy. It&#x27;s non- greasy and seems to be doing the trick. The stretch marks haven&#x27;t faded yet since I&#x27;ve only been using it for several weeks. However, I HATE the smell. The cocoa-flavor smell is very very strong and I just don&#x27;t like sweet smells on body lotions. If you can stand the smell, I say go for it.</li>
    <li> I will always love the smell of cocoa butter. I like the thickness of this lotion since I have dry skin. I think its the only reason why my skin is still soft to the touch. Most people wont believe me when I say that I have issues with dry skin. Funnier is when I&#x27;ve had guys wonder what scent perfume I was wearing and I said Nope! Just cocoa butter lotion. Been using Palmer&#x27;s for years and will continue to as long is it still for sale.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry skin lotion.  It works wonders. I tried it once, and switched for good.  Summertime is coming. I will be ready.</li>
    <li> Just wish it had just a little more scent to it.  But it works well for hands, arms or other parts that might need some moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Looked to be old stock?  Don&#x27;t know if it supposed to be thick .. almost toothpaste like.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it a few times.. then gf told me to toss it in the trash</li>
    <li> Is it bad that I&#x27;m a guy that is using this product? From the description it seems like this product was made primarily for women. Well guess what, I LOVE THIS LOTION!!! This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Does this mean that women get all the good stuff? lol. Well, I love the stuff and it is the best I have used. The fact that it smells like my favorite sweet (chocolate) doesn&#x27;t hurt either. I highly recommend this for ANYONE. Male, female, young, or old.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for almost 4 months now and this don&#x27;t work on my stretch marks, i don&#x27;t see any difference but i&#x27;m giving out 3 stars coz it makes my skin soft and smell good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a bunch of stretch marks since I was a kid and I&#x27;ve tried everything to make it go away... except for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it every day for the past few months, I&#x27;m speechless. A lot of my stretch marks that made me self-concious are beginning to fade and I cannot put into words my happiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tried every product, give this one a try. Make sure to use it everyday (I use it after the shower) and watch the results after a month. You&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
    <li> I use this during and after my two pregnancies to minimize the appearance of stretch marks and heal my skin.  It works great.  The key to good cocoa butter lotion is the thicker the better. This stuff is pretty thick. I thought mine was empty after using it for eight months but it&#x27;s not. There&#x27;s some in the bottom but because it&#x27;s so thick you have to get a little creative to get it out.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and smells wonderful.  It did noting for the stretch marks(I put in on 2x a day for a month), but it worked great on my face as well.</li>
    <li> First off, I am second to no one in my love of Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula.  That wonderful slightly chocolate scent sends me into orbit every time I apply the lotion to my hands.  The thickness and richness of the lotion, even the color -- I love everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the design of the 13.5-oz. pump dispenser bottle is the pits.  I&#x27;ve read a few reviews here on Amazon where people complain that they can&#x27;t get lotion out of the darn bottle.  Folks, there is a SECRET to getting the lotion out and I&#x27;m going to share it with you, but I&#x27;d like to pause a moment to ask the folks at Palmer&#x27;s why they haven&#x27;t printed instructions for the pump dispenser ON THE FLIPPING BOTTLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret to dispensing the incredibly rich, fragrant Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula is that you have to rotate the pump in a clockwise manner every time you want to dispense some of the lotion.  This is an irritating design and it means that I have to pick up the flipping bottle every time I want to pump some into my hands, I can&#x27;t just sit the bottle on my bedside table in one position to dispense the product.  There is a little circular arrow graphic at the top of the pump which I believe the folks at Palmer&#x27;s believe are adequate \\&quot;instructions\\&quot; for how to use the pump dispenser, but the complaints here in the Amazon.com review section testify to its inadequacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  lovely lotion but lousy bottle design.  Change it, Palmer&#x27;s, please!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help heal my mosquito bite scarred up legs.  So far my skin is super soft and I smell freaking delicious.  Hopefully it will help heal my scars as well.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible reaction to A&amp;D Ointment after using it on my tattoo. I had 40 or more dark spots all around my tattoo they made my leg look horrible. I started using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter and after 2 months every single dark spot is gone!! I my skin is so smooth and feels great! I love the scent as I love everything coconut!! This is the only lotion I will use from now on, I get tons of compliments on how great my skin looks, and now I can wear dresses and shorts tos how off my tattoo, without worrying about dark spots. Best product on the market!!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. So far, it has seemed to help me with my stretch marks that are rapidly forming across my pregnant tummy. Some people report having no luck with this, but I have seen success. Every time I see stretch marks, I use this for a day or two and the stretch marks seem to disappear.  While some may love its very strong chocolate scent, I found it a little too much sometimes and was wishing I would have gotten a scent-free one (and I never think like that).  Also, this lotion appears to be packed with vitamins which is great, but I also found it slightly greasy which may or may not be good under clothing. Luckily, it didn&#x27;t stain any of my clothes, so perhaps it was just feeling greasy.  Regardless, it&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of cocoa butter products.  This was a great price for stocking up on something I&#x27;ll be putting to good use :-)</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product and it makes your skin really soft. I would recommend it to somebody else.</li>
    <li> Was thick as cookie dough, unable to pump any out - threw it out</li>
    <li> Like the lotion but do NOT like the smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Kiehl&#x27;s user for years, but after reading the reviews, I decided to try this. At about 1/8 the cost of Kiehl&#x27;s, it&#x27;s a very close second. After a week of use, the little bumps on my upper arms are gone!  My skin is smooth and the lotion absorbs easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the smell, but it is strong and sweet, and interferes with perfumes. I took off one star for the smell.</li>
    <li> HAD A HARD TIME USINB THE PUMP USED IT WITHOUT IT. STILL A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, could not find this type in my local store.</li>
    <li> This smelled slightly different than the one I always purchase at target. It also had a black marker drawn over the bar code which may indicate that it&#x27;s not a true product.</li>
    <li> I suffered with cracked skin, in need of a dermatologist badly cracked, and my acupuncturist recommended this product. She gave me her personal bottle, I used it, and since I&#x27;m writing a review, you know I bought more. Coconut oil is healing to the skin, and this product packages it very neatly, while ensuring it&#x27;s efficacy. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great thick moisturizer, and smells great, like chocolate and cookies. Also it is much cheaper at target than Amazon.</li>
    <li> this cocoa butter lotion came quick and has worked very well. We use it for stretch marks on my wife and it helps with itching. she tries to get me to use it on her at least twice a day, I think she likes the message that comes with trying to rub in the thick lotion</li>
    <li> can not find a lotion or moisturizer that makes my skin feel as soft as this does! its so amazing and helps with stretch marks as well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion through out my pregnanacy and it´s worked great for me. I was concerned with getting stretch marks and a friend reccomended this lotion. I&#x27;ve used it regularly since my second trimester, it&#x27;s cheaper than many other pregnancy lotions and more effective. I&#x27;d recommend uisng it ALL OVER YOUR BODY not just, tummy and breasts. Many books are claiming that stretch marks during pregnancy are genetic I do not agree. I was using this lotion only in my tummy and breasts when at seven months I saw little stretch marks forming above my hip (love handles), since then I just use it head to toe. In my last trimester I started using &amp;#34;Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Soothing Oil for Dry, Itchy Skin&amp;#34; at night since I feel is the moment for a little &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; and has worked wonderfully, no sign of stretch marks although I&#x27;m 3 weeks to go. I&#x27;ll update :)</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended to me by a dermatologist.  I liked it because it was thick and creamy and kept my skin soft.  It is a bit pricey, so I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Palmers cocoa butter formula with vitamin E was highly recommended by my Podiatrist.&lt;br /&gt;It controls dry rough feet.  Top quality.</li>
    <li> I have vivid memories from my teens of Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter lotion.  It was a bit oilier than I preferred and the chocolatey smell was sometimes overwhelming, but it was stellar at combating ashiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am older, my skin is drier, and I&#x27;m living a cooler and more arid climate, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try again.  This \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version is not what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The original consistency was thinner and easier to spread over a large area quickly.  It was sort of like Vaseline Intensive Care but with more of an oil than water base.  This one is thicker and I don&#x27;t think it would spill out if I removed the top and turned it upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The original took a few minutes to absorb, but once it did, it left a nice sheen without surface oiliness.  This one is absorbed almost immediately which is a plus but does not leave my skin feeling silky or looking hydrated afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The original fragrance was loud and as unmistakeably distinct from other cocoa butter lotions as Johnson&#x27;s is from other baby lotions.  This one has a milder fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t really clash with any other complimentary fragrances you may wear; the smell pretty much dissipates after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because it&#x27;s not horrible, but it was just not the dry skin lotion I was expecting.  This one is just an average lotion for normal skin.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin. I used to get embarrassed by it (because you could tell that my elbows or my legs were dry) and I used to feel as though I had to apply cream 3 times a day. Which is a hassle and impractical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in Europe, I used the Cocoa-version of Garnier&#x27;s Body Cocoon for very dry skin. In the US, I couldn&#x27;t find the product (it was just very, very expensive over Amazon, not worth it for body lotion). I&#x27;ve decided to try this product, since it&#x27;s also made with cocoa butter and it works really well. The consistency is very thick and I prefer my cream to be a tiny bit more liquid and easy to spread, but you don&#x27;t need a lot of this cream and it&#x27;s really effective for dry skin as a total body lotion. I still maintain my old Garnier product in Europe was better, but I&#x27;m still satisfied with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my feet (especially when I use a lot of sandals or am at the beach) I use another, specialized foot cream.&lt;br /&gt;For my hands throughout the day I also another, special hand cream, just because I wash and disinfect my hands so often, they tend to dry out even faster.</li>
    <li> I grew up on Palmer&#x27;s and will be a devoted customer until I die. There are no downsides to this, unless you don&#x27;t like smelling like cocoa butter, in which case I suggest the scent-free version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s smooth, creamy and keeps ashy-ness at bay all day, even in winter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the overbearing smell of chocolate, but I guess it&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> Love the cocoa smell and consistency.  Use it all the time on arms, legs and face.  Also helpful is the pump top, which make it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like this cocoa butter lotion. The manufacturer of the cocoa butter lotion I have used for many years changed its formula and is not what it used to be. So I decided I needed to change lotions. This lotion is rather thick. I do not recommend using the pump at all. In fact mine broke the 1st time i used it :( I just happened to have a cap from an old shampoo bottle that worked perfectly for the new cap. I also recommend turning it upside down for storage. It REALLY is THICK stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I think the lotion works great. Within a few days my wintery dry skin was healed and soft again. Some people said they don&#x27;t like that strong chocolatey smell, but i think that is just personal taste. I LOVE chocolate so the smell does not bother me. I have always loved the smell of cocoa butter and there is a lot of in this lotion. Also i noticed some have said it is a little oily. Maybe a bit, but i can overlook that because I&#x27;ve had some lotions that were a lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this lotion to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to the manufacturer that they change the bottle design to make it easier to use~short &amp; squatty so it can be kept upside down :) BUT PLEASE DON&#x27;T CHANGE THE FORMULA. :) I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a thick and creamy lotion. It goes on very smooth and feels nice. I hear cocoa butter is supposedly good for reducing scars and stretch marks but I&#x27;ve only been using it for several days so we shall see. As I mentioned this stuff is thick, creamy, and would be great in the winter. For the warmer months this may be a little too rich but I&#x27;m going to use it regardless. It absorbs fairly well but I do need to put in a little more effort in rubbing it into my skin. It does leave my skin slightly oily immediately after applying but it&#x27;s not too noticeable. It has a sweet, chocolate smell to it which I personally like, however, I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable going out after putting this on. The scent is moderately strong and lingers for awhile. I usually use it at night after I take my shower. It leaves my skin moisturized, smelling good, and looking good. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I never used cocoa butter before, so you if you have already, you probably would figure that a dispenser like this won&#x27;t work well. I didn&#x27;t know, but the product itself is great.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it and would like to buy more if we have a chance to go to USA again.</li>
    <li> Two of my children have terrible eczema and I suffer from it as well, this cream is truly wonderful for us. It helps moisturize and soaks into our skin right away. It hardly stings like other creams and we&#x27;ve tried just about everything. Every cream we&#x27;ve tried has caused different degrees of sting including ones from our dermatologist; however, this one is the only one that my children  complain the least about. They are still small and I feel terrible when it hurts them.  We&#x27;ve tried ointments such as Aquaphor but we are allergic to an ingredient in Aquaphor and decided to go back to Palmer&#x27;s.  I even put this on my smallest child who is blessed with no eczema and he loves the smell.  The only warning I do have is that if you have an open cut it does sting a little but for us it quickly goes away and I have yet to find any product that works for stretch marks including this one.</li>
    <li> Really hydrating, best lotion I found yet. But I only give 4 stars because to me it smells awful . The chocolate scent is not that appealing and it is unbearable if you apply the lotion all over yourself. I know see there is a fragrance free one and I will be getting that one once I run out of the one I already have.    P.S. to anyone else, no topical treatment works on existing stretch marks. Stretch marks will fade on there own, you can prevent stretch marks with moisturizing, but once they are there you have to wait for them to fade on their own.</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s works great as a body lotion and even as a facial moisturizer. My deployed Marines request it because it&#x27;s so effective at preventing dry skin in the desert.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot, it is very hydrating! I hate the chocolate smell, though. I don&#x27;t like the fact that I always smell like chocolate. However, it is a very good lotion! I have extremely dry skin and this leaves my skin very soft. Also, it is not super thick, which is a plus for me.</li>
    <li> The pump broke on the first use, before I got any lotion out of it but thats just the technical details. The lotion is amazing. It smells wonderfully like chocolate. I have a hideous, large 2 yr old scar on my leg and the other day my husband said lateky it seemed to be getting smaller and less dark. I have been using it every morning for the last 4 months so maybe the scar claim actually is true. I primarily started using it on my legs and arms because my legs and elbow would get super dry and flaky and even if I forget for a couple days, I have not noticed the flakes coming back so yay!</li>
    <li> Totally love palmers cocoa butter and a good price, does the job as supposed to and use it often makes my skin sily smooth and smells gorgeous, and received quickly thankyou. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s lotion is a nice easy to apply lotion that has Vitamin E but not the usual stickiness of the vitamin - a more pleasant way to apply Vitamin E to damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many hand lotions over the years, and nothing is as pleasant to use as Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter. The consistency is perfect, not too greasy, and my only complaint is I can&#x27;t eat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle came broken, which was a bummer, but now it&#x27;s just a normal twist off bottle so whatever.</li>
    <li> OMG I can&#x27;t even believe how good this stuff is!  My poor feet were dry and cracked. After a few days of using this at night on my feet they are baby soft. Unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a moisturizer at a local Walmart, it smells like plastic nothing even close to cocoa butter, it is greasy and i feel like i am applying machine oil on my skin. It is a total waste of money!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good. I bought it to see if it would get rid of some scars i have and its working really well. i&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a lot of them are fading. i&#x27;ve been using it with the palmers cocoa butter skin therapy oil and its working wonders. its also very moisturizing and is a great base for body sprays :)</li>
    <li> Love it... Love it... Love it!!! Works extremely well for my type of skin tone.</li>
    <li> My wfe asked me to get this and she seemed to like i. I used it myself at yes hen my ands were chapped or just dry and I liked it too.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love it but after using it for the first time I developed a rash but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was from this or something I ate so I gave this a break for a week and used it again and got a rash again so it was just a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it leaves my skin very soft and smooth. I still haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my stretch marks but it&#x27;s too soon to tell. However I do know a fair amount of people that have improved the look of their stretch marks with this lotion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing to have while pregnant to avoid stretch marks on your tummy - plus use it on your feet as they get swollen!</li>
    <li> This lotion is really good. You will see a result within few days . Worth buying this lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Palmer brand of Cocoa Butter for years and love it as my daily moisturizer. I&#x27;ve occasionally tried other brands, but nothing works as well as Palmers. It smells wonderful, is incredibly rich, and it absorbs into my skin quickly. I&#x27;ve tried lots of other drugstore brands (and a few pricier brands as well) and Palmers continues to be my favorite choice.</li>
    <li> I love the bigger size of this lotion, I love that it comes in a pump bottle and I love how thick and creamy this lotion is.  I have some scars I am trying to fade and am trying this lotion on my skin to help stay moisturized, and hopefully fade my scars by the moisturization and the Vitamin E and cocoa butter.  This lotion smells great and goes on easily.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hand cream I have ever used in my life. HONESTLY! You only need a little bit of it and it smells like CHOCOLATE because it is COCOA butter, YUM! The only issue is the PUMP, due to the thickness of the lotion the pump doesn&#x27;t work well after a while and keeps disconnecting and you have to keep opening up the bottle and reconnecting it. Kind of a pain in the butt!</li>
    <li> Words can&#x27;t describe the wonders this product does for the skin. I always have a glow when I use this, and it reduces the appearance of scars and such, moisturizes really well and smells pretty good. What more can you ask for</li>
    <li> I use this every day! It is fabulous. It keeps my skin nice and soft. I had really dry hands from the cold winter and after using this for a few applications all the dryness went a way.</li>
    <li> Just as the title says.. it really does smell like chocolate.. I don&#x27;t really use it though.. I&#x27;m assuming it works great for other people especially pregnant women who are trying to avoid getting stretch marks...</li>
    <li> The subject says it all. :) Lotion works very well -- skin very smooth and soft -- and makes you smell yummy!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think my skin was dry until I started using this lotion. It is really thick..so thick that the bottom 1/4 can&#x27;t come out with the pump. I fix this by purchasing another bottle and when it gets a bit low, I drain the old bottle into the new bottle. This product is completely worth the effort. My skin is so supple now. I&#x27;ve recently lost a lot of weight and this cream was instrumental in helping with stretch marks and with toning my skin. It is also great to use after a sunburn.  This product is definitely on my auto buy list. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It came with its defective cap; however, we contacted the seller and they sent us the new one right away without extra charge. My wife likes the smell so much. We will definitely buy this product again. A great product, a trustworthy seller.</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s is the best grocery-store lotion! I love the sweet, faintly chocolate-y smell. And the texture, oh the texture...This is one of the few lotions on the market thick enough to feel right on my skin, and it&#x27;s absolutely luscious. The smell might be a little sweet for some users, though - it reminds me of Easter candy.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite lotion to use in the winter.  It smells like delicious chocolate and keeps my skin moisturized all day long.  Because it’s such a thick lotion, it does take some additional time to dry but it’s worth it!  I haven’t encountered any issues with the pump or bottle.  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Loved this purchase and loved the product it smells great makes your skin feel super smooth and helps remove any marks its worth every penny you get more than what you paid for</li>
    <li> I love this product! My skin is not only becoming even (all-over), but it is soft; and I have noticed that the skin around my ankles is looking much smoother. It&#x27;s like the aging process is being reversed. How great it that(!)?</li>
    <li> The product is outstanding,have been using it through my pregnancy, I am 38 wks now  and had made my skin very soft and toned,I am using it mostly on my hands and feet, for belly I love the 13.2 jar .I have to agree with other customers regarding strech marks,they are genetic.There is no such cream or herb or product that will make them go away or stop them from appearing.I am an RN and work with ante/ post partum patients and some  moms have tried everything,still have stretch marks and some don&#x27;t put anything on their skin and have no stretch marks.So you are either destined to get them or not get them.</li>
    <li> This Cocoa Butter is really great for the skin. I use it on stretch marks and on my neck and chest, it tightens and tones the skin and also moisturizes. Also what I really love is that it is NOT greasy at all. It also has a slight wonderful chocolate scent!</li>
    <li> Ok I love how this smells, I love how it feels, and it is just wonderful!! The dispenser&#x27;s could use some work but they do work just have to finagle them sometimes.</li>
