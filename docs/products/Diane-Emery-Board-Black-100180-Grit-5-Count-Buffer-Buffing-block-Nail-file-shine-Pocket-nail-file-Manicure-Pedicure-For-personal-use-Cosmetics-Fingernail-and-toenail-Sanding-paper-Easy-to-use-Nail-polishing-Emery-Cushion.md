      <li>These are great.</li>
      <li>Those emery boards are great.</li>
      <li>handy.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s OK....</li>
      <li>The packaging was okay, shipping was an acceptable time.</li>
      <li>Most people use this grit for acrylics.</li>
      <li>Finally found the best emery board files ever!</li>
      <li>An even fine grade would be better, but these did the job.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, I&#x27;ll buy more in the future..</li>
      <li>and for others whom say not as strong they should try a stone rock then..gez</li>
      <li>The fine side is good, but it seems more like the rough side of most emery boards.</li>
      <li>I use it on natural nails and am very pleased.  </li>
      <li>If you plan on breaking out of jail with these then they are great.</li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t even used a new one yet, and I&#x27;v  had them for a couple weeks now.....</li>
      <li>Forget those red things that wear down more than the nail.  </li>
      <li>Well......I&#x27;m only ordering more of these because I lose them just setting them down any old place.</li>
      <li>Board seemed very flimsy and coarser than others I&#x27;ve purchased with the same grit number.</li>
      <li>Will use no other files but these for my pup</li>
      <li>I actually like this grit for natural nails.</li>

    <li> The fine side is good, but it seems more like the rough side of most emery boards.</li>
    <li> These work well, The rough side will file long nails in no time and the fine side does an okay job smoothing them out.  An even fine grade would be better, but these did the job.  I did slice my finger with edge of one, so they do require that you pay attention.</li>
    <li> Good sturdy files that last a while. I use them for my toe nails which are thick and hard. The product was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Those emery boards are great.</li>
    <li> I have some black professional salon boards that I believe have to be at LEAST 30 years old.  I was looking for a replacement, but while these are okay, they&#x27;re not as sturdy as my current ones.</li>
    <li> I had a different brand of this file (in the same grit) and it was a lot stronger.  I use the emery boards to do my dog&#x27;s nails and they work great. This brand dosen&#x27;t do as well so I&#x27;ll keep looking for the others. These would probably work great for manicures or pedicures but they don&#x27;t last long when using them on dogs.</li>
    <li> files are very thin--nothing like the ones used in nail salons&lt;br /&gt;not worth the money---the nail salons sells them for less money--and a MUCH better quality</li>
    <li> I use files like crazy and so I had to buy more (as usual). These are great! If you purchase these you will get 5 files in one package. So it is really like you are paying five for the price of one. If you need a file these are the ones to buy!</li>
    <li> Most people use this grit for acrylics. I actually like this grit for natural nails. You just need Togo a bit easier on the pressure.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I&#x27;ll buy more in the future.. .very handy.</li>
    <li> I have the toughest nails in the world and would ruin an entire emery board after just one use. Well......I&#x27;m only ordering more of these because I lose them just setting them down any old place. But that&#x27;s OK....I don&#x27;t think these things ever wear out. In fact. I think you could sand a dresser with these.</li>
    <li> Perfect for grooming my puppy.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful. Perfect grit for filing my nails just the way I want them. Finally found the best emery board files ever!</li>
    <li> Board seemed very flimsy and coarser than others I&#x27;ve purchased with the same grit number. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> You said pack of 5 and I only got 3!!!! The packaging was okay, shipping was an acceptable time. Product is firm not flimsy seems well made and looks like it will get the job done right. Will buy from somebody else next time!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even used a new one yet, and I&#x27;v  had them for a couple weeks now.....and I constantly file my acrylic nails. Heavy duty stuff....great deal. At the store just one one these types of files are $2.99 and up.....so yyeeessssss...meets mine and my wallets expectations....and for others whom say not as strong they should try a stone rock then..gez</li>
    <li> They are long and that&#x27;s what I wanted so I could reach my toes to file them. I have troulble reaching my toes/.</li>
    <li> They are just what I was looking for.  They are extra strong and do the job quickly!  They use them at the nail place and I&#x27;m happy that I could find them online.</li>
    <li> Forget those red things that wear down more than the nail.  At 7&amp;#34; long, you can get a good grip on these, too.  They are stiff and appear very durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only clippers I could find that were sharp enough to trim the nail on my big toe were the ones that are curved in the &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; direction, which left a bunch of not-so-safe looking points.  This file took care of that in about 2 seconds.</li>
    <li> If you plan on breaking out of jail with these then they are great. Otherwise use on nasty feet not hands.</li>
    <li> These files are amazing!!!! I actually purchased them with the intent to use it for my dogs nails after I trim them. I was thinking about a rotary file but thought the noise and vibration might scare him. These files did the job perfectly! They are very sturdy and smooth out the sharp nails super easily! Will use no other files but these for my pup</li>
    <li> These are great. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of grit.  I use it on natural nails and am very pleased.  It always gives me a great manicure.</li>
    <li> Item just as described.  Will shop here again.</li>
