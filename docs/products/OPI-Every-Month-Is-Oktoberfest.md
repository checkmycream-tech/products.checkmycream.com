      <li>Fantastic &amp; fun color!</li>
      <li>I usually buy the OPI minis (I&#x27;m non-committal), but this shade is absolutely perfect.  </li>
      <li>The color is what is unique.  </li>
      <li>OPI has never disappointed.</li>
      <li>A unique color.</li>
      <li>This is just the right color for me!</li>
      <li>is gorgeous especially in the sunlight.</li>
      <li>You really need to google pictures for this polish and get a better sense.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great purple with a nice hint of red that almost makes me think more of a black cherryl.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty fall color that will get a lot of attention.</li>
      <li>This color is so rich and dark and gorgeous.</li>
      <li>Application is smooth, great color payoff with just one coat, although I always use at least two.</li>
      <li>It has so many different hues depending on the light.</li>
      <li>I chose this color at the salon and received so many compliments on it that I purchased a bottle and keep it in my collection to bring with to the salon and have available for the inevitable touch ups.  </li>
      <li>I love all of the colors from their German collection.  </li>
      <li>I love this color especially for fall and winter.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say the picture above is pretty accurate.</li>
      <li>I saw swatches of this color online and thought that it was really beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very festive for fall.</li>
      <li>Depending on the light, it has either a red or purple hue.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t chip away really fast</li>
      <li>It also lasted really well.</li>

      <li>The color is deep and rich.  </li>
      <li>And, as always, OPI colors seem to resist chips better than some other brands.</li>
      <li>i gave it 4 stars because in the bottle and even on the model it looks more red, but it&#x27;s actually a purpley maroon color when you paint it on.</li>
      <li>It has turned into my new go to, the slight shimmer is quite lovely.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite shade of purple, although I did have to slightly thin down the polish for a more smoother application.</li>
      <li>It is a deep, rich color that seems to change colors in different lighting.  </li>
      <li>it looks exactly like black cherry chutney from the India collection, a lovely dark reddish brown, but not what I thought I was buying</li>
      <li>and it still comes off as professional.</li>
      <li>warm, very glamor, I am so satisfied of my purchase, and it cost very less expensive than anywhere you could actually go</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly with the usual OPI quality.</li>
      <li>It looked to be a very rich, but dark red in the bottle, and then came out on my nails nearly black.</li>

    <li> Gorgeous color. Arrived in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> I rated this a 5. I absolutely LOVE the color. It&#x27;s great for fall! I will definitely keep buying this</li>
    <li> Fantastic &amp; fun color!</li>
    <li> The color does not match the af</li>
    <li> Bought as gift.  I use this color all the tie. It&#x27;s a great purple with a nice hint of red that almost makes me think more of a black cherryl.  Love Love the color</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my girlfriend. It looks great on her and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a good  product.</li>
    <li> My manicurist used to have this in her supplies; but I wanted my own bottle of it and this was it and the price was good.</li>
    <li> On me, this is an inky purple, almost black, with a subtle red-orangish flash. It&#x27;s amazing, and my boyfriend loves it so that&#x27;s a plus. It&#x27;s an OPI so the formula is flawless. Love this!</li>
    <li> The bottle looks like it&#x27;s an almost black/red.  But it in fact goes on as a black/purple.  I love this color!  Very festive for fall.</li>
    <li> Fantastic color, I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Very warm, very glamor, I am so satisfied of my purchase, and it cost very less expensive than anywhere you could actually go ti buy it physically.</li>
    <li> Great colour with bits of purple undertones.</li>
    <li> I just reviewed German-Icure and I have the identical thing to say about this one. I received this nail color in the mail along with German-Icure and I thought that these two nail colors were identical with just two different names stuck to the bottles. I was wrong. After I applied TWO coats of this color, I was pleased. I saw swatches of this color online and thought that it was really beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s a great color for the fall, and I can&#x27;t wait to paint my little toes with it! Beautiful and shimmery.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful fall color, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. Application is smooth, great color payoff with just one coat, although I always use at least two.</li>
    <li> I chose this color at the salon and received so many compliments on it that I purchased a bottle and keep it in my collection to bring with to the salon and have available for the inevitable touch ups.  It&#x27;s a very pretty fall color that will get a lot of attention.</li>
    <li> I am about to purchase my third bottle! I love this more than words can describe!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite shade of purple, although I did have to slightly thin down the polish for a more smoother application.</li>
    <li> Love, love this color! This color is a great fall shade. This was ordered and delieverd a few days after. I am in love with this color!!!</li>
    <li> Every month is Oktoberfest is a great deep purple. Perfect for the fall and winter. Perfect for football season for this Baltimore ravens fan!!!</li>
    <li> No complaints &amp; great color. Got if for a friend as a gift and she loved it. OPI always puts out great products and this one isn&#x27;t any different.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the color. It has so many different hues depending on the light. I get compliments every day. Hope it stays on the market.</li>
    <li> I love this color especially for fall and winter.  OPI is a great product and has fabulous colors.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It is a very dark color. I&#x27;d say the picture above is pretty accurate. It looked to be a very rich, but dark red in the bottle, and then came out on my nails nearly black. As another review said, though, in different lighting it looks different. That is all a matter of opinion, though. You either like how it goes with your own skin tone, or you don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m fair-skinned, and I just didn&#x27;t care for it. The reason for being only four stars is how streaky it went on. Once I had a couple coats, it went on beautifully. It also lasted really well. I am just used to OPI going on thick the first time, and only needing two coats.</li>
    <li> This color is so rich and dark and gorgeous. Probably my favorite now! OPI has never disappointed. Love them adore this color!</li>
    <li> This is a nice color for fall.  Goes on smoothly with the usual OPI quality.</li>
    <li> Not impressed by this color, its not even the slightest bit purple it looks exactly like black cherry chutney from the India collection, a lovely dark reddish brown, but not what I thought I was buying</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polish.....cannot have enough of them!  My manicurist put the Octoberfest on my nails and than Added a sparkle coat.  It looked fabulous!  So many compliments with this color.  I bought both Germany and Holland collections because there were too many gorgeous color to pick!!</li>
    <li> I am a purple fiend so this nail polish is perfect for me. I like that it doesn&#x27;t chip away really fast and I only use one coat and the color is gorgeous especially in the sunlight.</li>
    <li> Love this color. It has turned into my new go to, the slight shimmer is quite lovely. I wear it to work and it still comes off as professional.</li>
    <li> I love OPI. They always have cool colors and awesome names for their colors.  I love all of the colors from their German collection.  They are great for fall.</li>
    <li> I get this color when I get a manicure, and like it so much I decided to buy my own.  Although this is supposedly the same brand and color, it is actually very different in color.  I was very disappointed.  How could there be such a difference in color?</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dark matelic red for a long time. This is just the right color for me! The color looks off on the picture. You really need to google pictures for this polish and get a better sense.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color.  It is a deep, rich color that seems to change colors in different lighting.  It is a deep shade of purple and looks different on than in the bottle.  Love, love it!</li>
    <li> I usually buy the OPI minis (I&#x27;m non-committal), but this shade is absolutely perfect.  The color is deep and rich.  Depending on the light, it has either a red or purple hue.  And, as always, OPI colors seem to resist chips better than some other brands.</li>
    <li> i gave it 4 stars because in the bottle and even on the model it looks more red, but it&#x27;s actually a purpley maroon color when you paint it on. very nice though, and shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I love how depending on the light the color changes. From metallic cherry to burgendy to brown, sometimes even purple. Love it!</li>
    <li> Standard OPI polish, good coverage with two coats, good wearing time.  The color is what is unique.  Goes on much more purple-y than it appears in the bottle.  A unique color.</li>
    <li> Love this shade! Great find. Prices cheaper than at the the local stores. Took it to my pedicurist  to apply and so far no chips and looks great after 27 days except for grow out. Many compliments on the color.</li>
    <li> Great color. Doesn&#x27;t last long though. Even with a top and base coat lasted about 3 days then started fading at the edges and chipping.</li>
    <li> Nice rich fall color.  I get so many compliments.</li>
    <li> This color is a fall color, but very nice... OPI is a great nail polish brand. will recommend to everybody</li>
