      <li>Package came secure.  </li>
      <li>(I should note that I rarely use the word &#x27;love&#x27; in any of my reviews.)</li>
      <li>Lacks any &#x27;staying power&#x27; - gave the impression of being a cheap &#x27;copy&#x27; rather than the genuine article.</li>

      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Nice different scent!</li>
      <li>I would not use Amazon to purchase any kind of fragrance product in the future.</li>
      <li>Still prefer the original &amp;#34;Brownstone&amp;#34; by Paul Sebastion and Aramis Devon (original old formula &amp; packaging).</li>

      <li>I was looking for a new evening, fall/winter scent.</li>
      <li>But what I like about it is that it is not a super strong or overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is long lasting which is really important to me.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many different colognes over the years, everything from Abercrombie Woods to Polo Black.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s masculine but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>and she instantly said wow</li>
      <li>When I wear it out, I can&#x27;t smell it and have NEVER gotten a compliment, neither good or bad.  </li>

    <li> Very nice cologne.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and delivery.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Lasts all day</li>
    <li> expected more of this</li>
    <li> An excellent and masculine scent that has rewarded me with numerous compliments.  The scent is long lasting which is really important to me.  Currently this is my favorite scent!  The package arrived quickly (as usual) through Amazon.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great .. All the ladies love it!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely impressed. I was looking for a new evening, fall/winter scent. I absolutely found it. It&#x27;s masculine but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Love it. One of the best fragrances L&#x27;Eau D&#x27;Issey make.</li>
    <li> Everybody Loves this fragrance.  I have never worn it since buying and not got a compliment.  Great smell on this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate a cologne. We love it, but you know scents smell different on each person. But what I like about it is that it is not a super strong or overpowering scent. My husband wears it.  Sometimes when a hug my male friends, then their cologne rubs off on me and I smell like their cologne. That makes me crazy. This one has not done that.  (Or maybe my husband doesn&#x27;t wear so much ... not sure which).</li>
    <li> I love all Issey Miake fragrances. (I should note that I rarely use the word &#x27;love&#x27; in any of my reviews.) L&#x27;Eau D&#x27;Issey is no exception. A clean, fresh and masculine scent. It&#x27;s that fragrance that everyone says, &amp;#34;oh, you smell good! What are you wearing??&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price also can&#x27;t be beat. It was considerably less ordering it through Amazon than it was in the department stores. Score.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he love it!!!</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. Lacks any &#x27;staying power&#x27; - gave the impression of being a cheap &#x27;copy&#x27; rather than the genuine article. I would not use Amazon to purchase any kind of fragrance product in the future.</li>
    <li> The wife and the ladies seem to like it, i get a lot of comments.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes and I use it almost everyday. My only issue is that the scent wears off after a few hours.</li>
    <li> Exceptional sent very smooth evening type cologne</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different colognes over the years, everything from Abercrombie Woods to Polo Black. But this cologne is the best one yet. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; enough to last all day but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. You can use it both during the day as well as evening, it works for both. I have gotten multiple positive comments on the scent from both men and women (don&#x27;t tell the wife!).</li>
    <li> Receive it on time and we love it.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!!!! Issey Miyake ENOUGH SAID....</li>
    <li> Great price, fast delivery, just as advertised.. A++++!!</li>
    <li> Nice...very nice.  It&#x27;s all a personal choice...any scent is.  For me - very nice.</li>
    <li> Nice different scent!</li>
    <li> Nice cologne! I&#x27;ve had quite a few compliments on it.</li>
    <li> A great fragrance and long lasting.  Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Plan to give it for a gift in the next few days.  Package came secure.  this source had this item before Nordstrom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great perfium, I bought it for my fiancee and he loved it so much! Great price and fast delivery, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It smells nice but very, very light.  Maybe it&#x27;s my body chemistry but I can spray a good heaping amount on (at bedtime) and when I wake up, I can&#x27;t smell it on myself or my sheets or pillows.  When I wear it out, I can&#x27;t smell it and have NEVER gotten a compliment, neither good or bad.  So it smells good going on, but for me, it doesn&#x27;t last enough to give it more than 3 stars or to recommend this</li>
    <li> Smells like fake. Can&#x27;t smell no more once I step out of the house.</li>
    <li> Meh, its okay.  Still prefer the original &amp;#34;Brownstone&amp;#34; by Paul Sebastion and Aramis Devon (original old formula &amp; packaging).</li>

    <li> Bought for my hunny as a Christmas gift and he wears it everyday. I love the smell!</li>
    <li> I will be getting more real soon</li>
    <li> My current go-to for evening events.  Lots of compliments and unique scent.</li>
    <li> Outstanding! It lasts all day. The fragrance exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must have for any well dressed man!</li>
