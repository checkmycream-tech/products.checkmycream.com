      <li>Like it a lot, good product</li>
      <li>The brush seemed to be good at separating lashes, but I like having longer looking lashes rather than thicker.</li>
      <li>A good product, but</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Except that, it is good.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve heard many great things.</li>
      <li>Came very fast and the mascara formula and brush are awesome.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>This mascara is just wonderful for that very thing!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>Better than the high-priced stuff!  </li>
      <li>I got this mascara based on the many good reviews here...</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how many good reviews this mascara had gotten.</li>
      <li>Get a nice coat on, then I spread out my lashes with the end of the wand.</li>
      <li>This was so easy!  </li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you.</li>
      <li>I thought it looks okay</li>
      <li>OK.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to many chemicals</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>I have so many allergies</li>
      <li>I have used Almay for many years, and I am always pleased with their products.</li>
      <li>I got more mascara on my eyelids than on my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Keep trying the latest and greatest brands, types and keep coming back to this one-coat wonder!</li>
      <li>I really like the brush which gives great coverage.</li>
      <li>okay....</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I love that I receive my mascara every three months like clockwork.</li>
      <li>This mascara looks very nice and goes on fast.  </li>
      <li>I could easily wipe off most of it with just a tissue.  </li>
      <li>I prefer a tapered tip so you can get into the corners of the eyes more easily.</li>
      <li>this product its great for me, I have never used before a mascara because I have sensitive eyes, but this gave me the opportunity to show my eyelashes to the world!</li>
      <li>It came off easily with just soap and water.</li>
      <li>It washes off easily with soap and water, doesn&#x27;t pool my lashes out while doing so, and never smudges while I wear it.  </li>
      <li>Strongly suggest a tapered brush applicator.</li>
      <li>volume and length are fine.</li>
      <li>Amazing and VERY waterproof.</li>
      <li>No matter how lightly I apply, no matter any changes in technique, mascara has ALWAYS given me raccoon eyes within three hours.</li>
      <li>i thought its really look a big lashes, its good but not the best, you look more but not bigger lashes</li>
      <li>old brush was from covergirl professional remarkable, which i liked as a mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Almay is the only eye make up I can use, so am thrilled to be able to get this product.</li>
      <li>I am very fair and have few lashes.  </li>
      <li>so I think it&#x27;s pretty important for reviewer to identify some relevant traits about themselves, that way readers can decide if the product may also work for them or not.  </li>
      <li>had an old mascara that needed to be thrown out, but i liked the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This definitely puts a good bit of length on the end but don&#x27;t help keep the curl.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes my eyes shine and really cool.</li>
      <li>The result is so natural yet places a nice emphasis on my eyes</li>
      <li>Then I look straight on in the mirror and lift my lashes and get the tips of them, so I have longer, thicker, darker lashes that are super clump free!</li>
      <li>I have been on a search for a good, long lasting waterproof mascara and this one seemed to get good reviews</li>
      <li>I have fine lashes and the brush has a tendency to push them around on the first coat.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many mascaras and I would say this if my favorite as of current.</li>
      <li>Read the previous reviews and noticed that experience with this mascara wasn&#x27;t great for everyone.  </li>
      <li>First off, if you don&#x27;t use this stuff the right way, it can be a HUGE Pain.</li>
      <li>yet so I can not comment on its waterproof ability but for everyday wear its great.</li>
      <li>After trying numerous products, my wife has finally found that the Almay One Coat holds up the best for the whole day and without irritation.  </li>
      <li>Unlike some of the other mascaras that also got a great score (safer ingredients) this one run doesn&#x27;t rub off throughout the day and really magnifies my lashes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better, namely maybelline&#x27;s full and soft waterproof can compare to this, but doesn&#x27;t smudge as much.</li>
      <li>, right?....</li>
      <li>it gives just the right amount of product .</li>
      <li>While this mascara is nice, I don&#x27;t find it any different or better than the other mascaras available in your drug store.</li>
      <li>The brush seemed too large to do an adequate job.</li>
      <li>Unlike many Asians, my lashes have a natural curve to them without me having to do much.  </li>
      <li>Love the brush, love the non flaking BUT within a few hours I had raccoon eyes.  </li>
      <li>The more natural mascaras are really smudgy, but this one is pretty stubborn.</li>
      <li>I have purchased it for years and it never fails.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s life-changing for me to actually be able to wear mascara, I can actually wear dressy makeup now!</li>
      <li>In fact, I think I noticed the opposite - my lashes looked more sparse after.  </li>
      <li>Only wear mascara on my top lashes, btw.  </li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t be a product I&#x27;d be interested in trying again.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a habit of rubbing my eyes, my eyes don&#x27;t water more than normal, they&#x27;re not particularly deep set...</li>
      <li>But it does not clump and is a good black for blondes, who want more than the black brown accent.</li>
      <li>so smart of me</li>
      <li>So I can&#x27;t tell you whether Almay Get Up and Go holds a curl well for straight lashes.  </li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not flake, wears very well, is waterproof and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>I was taking a break from the Rimmel lash accelerator which I really like.</li>
      <li>This mascara got very smudgey under my eyes after wearing it for just 3 hours.</li>
      <li>While it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of adding volume or length.</li>
      <li>The whole process takes about 10 minutes each morning.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very affordable.</li>
      <li>Since this product is able to make my sparse lashes look much thicker in the short run as well as the long run and doesn&#x27;t smear until 6 hours of wear, it is a lot better than what other drug store products are capable of.</li>
      <li>It does do a decent job at holding a curl, but the smudging just will not cut it for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like Almay mascara so naturally when I decided to start buying it through Amazon as a subscribe and save, I picked this one.  The only thing I have a problem with is the thickness of the brush.  I have fine lashes and the brush has a tendency to push them around on the first coat.  That results in some smudges if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
    <li> This mascara looks very nice and goes on fast.  It washes off easily with soap and water, doesn&#x27;t pool my lashes out while doing so, and never smudges while I wear it.  I like the different colors and shades.  It does not cause any allergic reaction at all.</li>
    <li> Read the previous reviews and noticed that experience with this mascara wasn&#x27;t great for everyone.  so I think it&#x27;s pretty important for reviewer to identify some relevant traits about themselves, that way readers can decide if the product may also work for them or not.  I am Asian so the blackest black doesn&#x27;t jump out on me, and that&#x27;s what I use.  CURL HOLDING: Unlike many Asians, my lashes have a natural curve to them without me having to do much.  So I can&#x27;t tell you whether Almay Get Up and Go holds a curl well for straight lashes.  THICKENING: I do suffer from pretty sparse lashes, and this mascara does a wonderful job in increasing volume by creating a dark, thick layer near the base of each lash and fan out near the tip.  I usually apply two or three coats though, combing through my lashes after each application to get rid of clumps.  The whole process takes about 10 minutes each morning.  The result is so natural yet places a nice emphasis on my eyes it&#x27;s usually the only makeup product I wear to work.  SMEARING: At around 3pm, I would start getting a dark shadow under my eyes and I&#x27;d have to start wiping, but that&#x27;s because my skin is on the oily side and every single mascara on earth does that on me.  GROWING:  I am on my second tube now; after finishing the first tube, I temporarily switched to an older mascara (maybelline falsies) and noticed that my lashes looked thicker with that on than before!  Not much change in length though.  CONCLUSION: Since this product is able to make my sparse lashes look much thicker in the short run as well as the long run and doesn&#x27;t smear until 6 hours of wear, it is a lot better than what other drug store products are capable of.</li>
    <li> Amazing and VERY waterproof.</li>
    <li> Both the wand and product consistency are perfect for my needs.  Better than the high-priced stuff!  Doesn&#x27;t clump or run.</li>
    <li> My eyes are so weird. They&#x27;re allergic to all manner of cosmetic except this product!</li>
    <li> Very awesome, Thankyou</li>
    <li> Came very fast and the mascara formula and brush are awesome. Great for all day wear! Definitely a 5 star purchase</li>
    <li> I got this mascara based on the many good reviews here... this is my opinion. I had issues with clumping and I would have smearing under my eyes by afternoon. The brush seemed to be good at separating lashes, but I like having longer looking lashes rather than thicker. I was taking a break from the Rimmel lash accelerator which I really like. I wont buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have a horrible case of smudging with most mascaras, but this mascara by far smudged the fastest and the worst. It does do a decent job at holding a curl, but the smudging just will not cut it for me. I&#x27;ve had better, namely maybelline&#x27;s full and soft waterproof can compare to this, but doesn&#x27;t smudge as much.</li>
    <li> So far, no lash growth, but i like the formula for all day wear.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I had an old mascara that needed to be thrown out, but i liked the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I washed the wand on my old mascara and swapped it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old brush was from covergirl professional remarkable, which i liked as a mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/CoverGirl-Professional-Remarkable-Washable-Waterproof/dp/B000RO6ZDA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1427888946&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;covergirl+mascara+professional+remarkable</li>
    <li> And it does rub off.  I wore it a few times, because it it water proof, but it does rub off if not careful</li>
    <li> Love the mascara formula - HATE HATE HATE the brush applicator!  It is too big and bushy and too hard to get the inner and outer corners of your lashes and lower lashes without poking yourself in the eye or leaving globs on your eyelid.  Strongly suggest a tapered brush applicator.</li>
    <li> I am saddened to say that I thought this would be a great mascara for a contact lens wearer.  Love the brush, love the non flaking BUT within a few hours I had raccoon eyes.  This is without under eye concealer so it must be so much worse with concealer.  Only wear mascara on my top lashes, btw.  There goes my subscribe and save, :( cancelled.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot, good product</li>
    <li> Keep trying the latest and greatest brands, types and keep coming back to this one-coat wonder! Love it!</li>
    <li> I must admit, I do have very short eyelashes, but this mascara didn&#x27;t do much for me. This adds volume but not length to my eyelashes. What happened to the grow part? I&#x27;m a bit disappointed seeing that this is Almay and I&#x27;ve heard many great things. I will continue to keep looking for the mascara for me.</li>
    <li> I am very fair and have few lashes.  This mascara is just wonderful for that very thing!</li>
    <li> i thought its really look a big lashes, its good but not the best, you look more but not bigger lashes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years as this is the only one works for me and recommended by my eye doctor (2 thumbs up). I wear contacts daily without any issues !. I am allergic to many chemicals and I have limited options when it comes to using cosmetic products.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Hypoallergenic&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clump&lt;br /&gt;Easy to remove with makeup remover&lt;br /&gt;Great for contact wearer&lt;br /&gt;Nourish lashes and prevent from breaking&lt;br /&gt;Cons: NOTHING!!!</li>
    <li> A good product, but I don&#x27;t like the brush. It&#x27;s too blunt on the end. I prefer a tapered tip so you can get into the corners of the eyes more easily. Not sure what their thinking is about this. Other than that, I like it.</li>
    <li> it gives just the right amount of product . volume and length are fine. even when you put on several coats it doesn&#x27;t clumb or smear.</li>
    <li> Gives you the length you want but it can get a bit chunky.&lt;br /&gt;BUT no smear, i even have trouble taking it off at times.</li>
    <li> moved on and tried something else</li>
    <li> Perfect performance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my eyes shine and really cool. I have so many allergies and this is a perfect product for persons like me.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. I was looking for one that was paraben-free. The more natural mascaras are really smudgy, but this one is pretty stubborn. It stays on all day without any raccoon eyes, and makes my lashes dark and thick.</li>
    <li> I love that I receive my mascara every three months like clockwork. I find that my eyes thank me for changing out my mascara every three months and when I begin to use a new tube, my sensitive eyes give a sigh of relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used all the mascaras out there and need to switch around after several years of using one product because my eyes tend to develop a sensitivity to that product. I am now using Almay &amp; am thankful that Amazon carries it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not flake, wears very well, is waterproof and doesn&#x27;t clump. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Terrible. It doesnt stay in place throughout the day. By mid-day, I have dark smudges under my eyes. hate it.</li>
    <li> I buy waterproof mascara to stay in place throughout the day. This doesn&#x27;t. By mid-day, I have dark smudges under my eyes. Not happy.</li>
    <li> My Favorite Mascara!! Gives wonderful volume to lashes.  Great seller too</li>
    <li> I really like the brush which gives great coverage. Apparently my eyes are getting sensitive as it irritated my eyes at the end of the day.Not as waterproof as I would like.</li>
    <li> Excellent mascara.  I have purchased it for years and it never fails.  I have extreme allergies with eye sensitivity and this mascara works very well for me.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely mascara and even though it is waterproof, it will run after a few hours.  But it does not clump and is a good black for blondes, who want more than the black brown accent.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many good reviews this mascara had gotten. It does everything you hate in mascara. It clumps horribly, irritates my eyes, leaves black dust on my face and after a couple months of using it my eyelashes are shorter! It&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> While it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of adding volume or length.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have ever used I absolutely love it! It goes on without cluming and i get compliments everytime ive worn it.</li>
    <li> A litle diasppointed the line went on to thick did not make my lashes look natural not sure if I will order this product again it clum[s up.</li>
    <li> This was so easy!  I din&#x27;t have to remember to look for mascara when I was shopping.  It showed up on my doorstep.  I have used Almay for many years, and I am always pleased with their products.</li>
    <li> OK. First off, if you don&#x27;t use this stuff the right way, it can be a HUGE Pain. In. The. *Ahem*. People say the brush is too.... &amp;#34;brushy&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;big&amp;#34;. All of the above and then some. Ditch the brush. I personally use the brush from the Almay One Coat Nourishing Lengthening Mascara, and curve it a little to easier reach every lash. OK, so you&#x27;ve switched brushes and all that crap, now ya gotta wipe, wipe, wipe! I wipe the brush all over the side of the tube to where it gets all gunky and annoying... so smart of me, right?.... and then dab the end of the brush on a makeup remover wipe until there is no mascara left on the tip, and very little on the brush. I tilt my head back, pull up my eyelid, and look into the mirror, so that if I were looking the way my head was tilted, I would see the ceiling, but look into the mirror ahead of me. Then, I apply the mascara, so there are no clumps. Get a nice coat on, then I spread out my lashes with the end of the wand. Then I look straight on in the mirror and lift my lashes and get the tips of them, so I have longer, thicker, darker lashes that are super clump free! As for the growing part, I guess its okay.... I use other things to grow my lashes so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you. Hope this review was helpful!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I have medium length lashes and this helps them look longer and they are gorgeous! I have not had&lt;br /&gt;Any issues with clumping or having the issues that other users have. Buying my second tube today. I will update is the Amazon mascara seems different then what I&#x27;ve bought at my local store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old. I have tried different mascaras my whole life. I don&#x27;t have a habit of rubbing my eyes, my eyes don&#x27;t water more than normal, they&#x27;re not particularly deep set...I don&#x27;t get it. No matter how lightly I apply, no matter any changes in technique, mascara has ALWAYS given me raccoon eyes within three hours. Even very expensive waterproof brands. Every time. Until now. THIS MASCARA ACTUALLY STAYS PUT!! It&#x27;s life-changing for me to actually be able to wear mascara, I can actually wear dressy makeup now! I love this product!</li>
    <li> I thought it looks okay when on but clump, and It burned and dried out my eyes.  I noticed no growth.  In fact, I think I noticed the opposite - my lashes looked more sparse after.  Wouldn&#x27;t be a product I&#x27;d be interested in trying again.</li>
    <li> The best waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve ever found. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> The brush seemed too large to do an adequate job. The product seemed quite dry. I have already moved on to try another product, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Clumps up.  Don&#x27;t like to use.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. I bought this because of its score on ewg&#x27;s list for cosmetics. Unlike some of the other mascaras that also got a great score (safer ingredients) this one run doesn&#x27;t rub off throughout the day and really magnifies my lashes. It&#x27;s also very affordable. I will admit that I haven&#x27;t tested it while swimming yet so I can not comment on its waterproof ability but for everyday wear its great.</li>
    <li> It obviously make my eyelashes look long.&lt;br /&gt;But there are little clogs when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Except that, it is good.</li>
    <li> Almay is the only eye make up I can use, so am thrilled to be able to get this product.</li>
    <li> After trying numerous products, my wife has finally found that the Almay One Coat holds up the best for the whole day and without irritation.  Easier to get with prime shipping than going to the store. Always the cheapest on amazon.</li>
    <li> Every time I&#x27;ve used this, I&#x27;ve ended up with black smudges under my eyes within a couple hours. I gave up on it after a couple weeks and tossed it. Money wasted.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find the mascara that is the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34;. While this mascara is nice, I don&#x27;t find it any different or better than the other mascaras available in your drug store. It has a nice black color, it is thick (if you like that), and it washes off easily even though it is a waterproof mascara. I didn&#x27;t think it would actually make my eye lashes grow, but I figured the extra conditioning aspect of this mascara couldn&#x27;t hurt. Overall I didn&#x27;t see much of a change in my lashes. Would I purchase this mascara again in the future? Probably so, who knows... it just may make my eye lashes grow longer with continued use.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have EXTREMELY sensitive eyes and it is hard to keep any kind of mascara on for long periods of time but this is great! I can actually make it through the day w/o wanted to rip my eye balls out!!</li>
    <li> I liked this mascara because it definitely helped bring my lashes back to their former glory after using waterproof mascara and an evil eyelash curler, but MAN it will make you look like Cruella while it does. This is some thick, dry and nasty cakey mascara- the absolute worst consistency I have ever seen in a mascara- but it will help your eyelashes grow back after trauma after only 2 or 3 weeks. Don&#x27;t expect a miracle here- if you don&#x27;t have much to begin with it probably won&#x27;t give you magically long Disney eyelashes. Go on Groupon and get some extensions if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after.</li>
    <li> Almay One Coat Get Up and grow waterproof Mascara is the best. All Almay products are wonderful I will use nothing else but Almay.</li>
    <li> this product its great for me, I have never used before a mascara because I have sensitive eyes, but this gave me the opportunity to show my eyelashes to the world!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian and am cursed with stick-straight short lashes that like poking my eyeball. This definitely puts a good bit of length on the end but don&#x27;t help keep the curl. Also it can be a little clumpy so I have to do a few swipes more to clear it away.</li>
    <li> Almay&#x27;s One Coat Get Up and Grow Waterproof Mascara was a big disappointment for me. I have been on a search for a good, long lasting waterproof mascara and this one seemed to get good reviews so I thought I would give it a try. After just 4 days of using this mascara, it is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;During application, I noticed some flaking, but no clumping. The brush is larger than what I am accustomed to, but it was not the deal breaker. The real deal breakers I had with this mascara are that it is NOT waterproof, it smudges under my eyes after just a few hours and it definitely needed more than one coat to adequately coat my lashes. Typically, I  need to use waterproof makeup remover to remove waterproof mascara, but not this one! It came off easily with just soap and water. This mascara got very smudgey under my eyes after wearing it for just 3 hours. I could easily wipe off most of it with just a tissue.  I definitely would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Smudgy, but doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes. Strange how I have to use make up remover to get it off,  but it still rubs off if I smile too much.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the brush which is very big. It does not separate the lashes and causes the mascara to clump.  I got more mascara on my eyelids than on my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I have tried many mascaras and I would say this if my favorite as of current. I have used it for 2 wks and still loving it!</li>
