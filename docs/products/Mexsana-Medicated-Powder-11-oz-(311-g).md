    <li> Great all purpose product.</li>
    <li> Since I had trouble finding this locally, it was so much easier to order it. My husband uses it in his shoes.</li>
    <li> I bought this powder on the recommendations on this page. I was going to buy Gold Bond, and several people there mentioned this one. I am glad I gave it a try. It is immediately soothing, and has no obvious fragrance. It certainly doesn&#x27;t have a medicine smell at all. Nor does it smell powdery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item arrived quickly and well-packaged. When I run out I will order this powder again.</li>

    <li> Thanks for carrying this powder.  I have tried multiple stores and was unable to find it.  Took a chance and found it at Amazon .com.  Use it regularity and it helps with a variety of maladies.</li>
    <li> Used it for years, heals chafing rapidly, in a day or two, it seems.</li>
    <li> Best powder and ingredients of its kind on the market. Works rapidly to change and alleviate skin problems associated for its use.</li>
    <li> If you have problems with athletes feet or just plain old smelly feet, use this. This medicated powder is the best for this problem. Works on the first day</li>
