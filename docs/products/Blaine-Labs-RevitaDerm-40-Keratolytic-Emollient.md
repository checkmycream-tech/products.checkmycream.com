      <li>Amazing..</li>
      <li>I wanted to thank BlaineLabs for the care and thought that went into formulating an amazing product.  </li>
      <li>I have used this before and knew that I liked it.</li>
      <li>maybe it just takes a good deal longer to have a more noticeable effect.  </li>
      <li>feet were diagnosed acute</li>
      <li>*both* so incredibly appreciative.  </li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best cream on the market!</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and is effective for removing corn and callus.</li>
      <li>It works better then</li>
      <li>Even Dermatologists don&#x27;t really have great cures for the condition.</li>
      <li>Very happy with the product AND the way customer service handled an initial mix-up with my account.</li>
      <li>I gave it one star because for more than 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve been using this product at night on my feet, legs and arms</li>

      <li>We&#x27;re lucky because most dogs don&#x27;t make it.  </li>
      <li>this cream is super magic  </li>

      <li>I have psoriasis and it is fabulous used in conjunction w aloe.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff...keeps my damaged feet soft</li>
      <li>Super stuff</li>
      <li>This stuff will remove any extra skin from your feet quick!!!</li>
      <li>OK, maybe not quite, but this particular product does exactly as it should.  </li>
      <li>Pricing was more reasonable than for 20% urea creams that I was able to find in my local CVS, and this came with a bonus of a pumice stone/scrubbing brush.</li>
      <li>Love the product though but suspect what I received is really old.</li>
      <li>With just one application my elbows returned to soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>All items in RevitaDERM were either a 0 or 1 on a scale of 0 to 9 (i.e., they&#x27;re very, very NON-toxic), a fact I don&#x27;t take for granted.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many different lotions, creams and gadgets through the years to help my bleeding, cracking heels.  </li>
      <li>First purchased from my podiatrist.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, she has been successfully treated (using Traditional Chinese Medicine) and is recovering from the virus.  </li>
      <li>Even though I know each ingredient is incredibly safe, it never was intended for internal consumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Our podiatrist sold us our first jars and it keeps feet smoooooth.</li>
      <li>really works, we got this at the dr office the first time, found it on here much cheaper.</li>
      <li>my skin daily and apply moist cream daily amazing results</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
      <li>So off to Whole Foods today to get the product I intended to buy (non-gmo).....</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t help as much as I thought it would for callouses.</li>
      <li>I have very calloused feet that crack and get sore.  </li>
      <li>I will say that is seems better than other items we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried various skin creams before and none had any significant effect on my old age areas.</li>
      <li>Her hot, dry calluses really are smoother and not so hot.  </li>
      <li>The texture of the cream is very thick, so you might not want to walk around on a good rug immediately; put on some socks or let the cream soak in for five minutes.</li>
      <li>You wouldn&#x27;t take more than a few steps before YOU refused to walk or stand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My toenail is 3/4 grown out with no traces of toenail fungus in new growth.</li>
      <li>but I live by it  </li>
      <li>was nothing in the market, that I would have to live for ever both with pain, feet cracking,&lt;br /&gt;bleeding</li>
      <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
      <li>At first I was using it twice a daily</li>
      <li>on my second apply i note a big diference after 2 week my arms were clean ...</li>
      <li>It’s as though the old skin cells on parts of my body don’t slough off naturally at the rate that normal skin cells do.</li>
      <li>There was no long wait to see if the product was working; I really noticed the difference on day two.</li>
      <li>New bottle seems to be an older marketing on the outside of the container.  </li>
      <li>It was recommended by my doctor and so far, its working well.  </li>
      <li>The urea in this cream helps break the bonds that allow my old skin cells to build up.</li>
      <li>My heels healed completely in a matter of weeks.  </li>
      <li>If I put the cream on immediately after taking a bath, my feet are soft and my callouses don’t crack.</li>
      <li>Melts callouses away slowly but surely.  </li>
      <li>Suspect product may be several years old!!!  </li>
      <li>The pros: fast and effective, easy to use (very little scrubbing, can be done in daily bath or shower), helps with sweaty feet, not greasy and absorbs quickly, can be used with other products such as Vaseline or antifungal sprays, its diabetic friendly, and it doesn’t require heavy applications (a little goes a long way).</li>
      <li>The pads of her feet are so tender, hot and dry that using a file or pumice stone is NOT an option.  </li>
      <li>This is the best cream for my feet, especially in the cold, dry winter weather.  </li>
      <li>The key ingredient is the high urea content which I learned while working for podiatrists.</li>
      <li>This cream does exactly what it says it does, for once a product that works as expected it would work.</li>
      <li>and super heavy callous.  </li>
      <li>and I noticed major improvement after the 1st use.  </li>
      <li>and I have not seen any major improvement or difference on my skin yet.</li>
      <li>The price might be a little steep for some; however it’s DEFINITELY worth the investment.</li>
      <li>I had tried all kinds of creams, oils, and ointments to get rid of my scaly, peeling elbows; with little success.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t surprised that I had to go through a number of urea-based creams on the market before I found a totally NON-toxic solution ...</li>
      <li>My 40 year old feet looked like those of a teen.  </li>
      <li>Going to send back as I don&#x27;t want old lotion.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Now this stuff works to remove that scaly stuff.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a month and I see no improvement on my feet</li>
    <li> My husband loves his baby feet again</li>
    <li> Not sure if I received a really old product or they recently changed labels.  Labels on my container at home purchased at doctors office seems newer marketing compared to what I received.  New bottle seems to be an older marketing on the outside of the container.  Suspect product may be several years old!!!  Going to send back as I don&#x27;t want old lotion.  Love the product though but suspect what I received is really old.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My dermatologist gave me a prescription for 5% Urea cream that I tried on my dry, scaly elbows. She said it&#x27;s only available via prescription - wrong - I can buy it on Amazon for a fraction of what the pharmacy charges. I&#x27;ve tried various skin creams before and none had any significant effect on my old age areas. But this stuff is like magic! With just one application my elbows returned to soft and healthy. So then I put it on my scaly heels, knees, etc. and everywhere I put it got the same results - unbelievable! Now I only use it about once a week and no longer have any dry scaly skin in any of those notorious places. I&#x27;m a guy, over 70 years old, and am really happy that there is such a simple cure to my nasty areas. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Best dry foot cream around.  Our podiatrist sold us our first jars and it keeps feet smoooooth.</li>
    <li> I gave it one star because for more than 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve been using this product at night on my feet, legs and arms and I have not seen any major improvement or difference on my skin yet. I have some keratosis on both my upper arms after my second pregnancy and this product did not improve the skin condition on my arms.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended a 40% urea cream for my badly cracked heels, and after just one week of use I am finally not ashamed to wear sandals. Pricing was more reasonable than for 20% urea creams that I was able to find in my local CVS, and this came with a bonus of a pumice stone/scrubbing brush. I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Amazing..I&#x27;ve tried everything over the counter and I noticed major improvement after the 1st use.  I am definitely not one to write reviews, but I felt I had to. I was resolved to try a 40% urea cream before having to ask my dermatologist for a prescription. I had horribly dry embarrassing feet, especially in the winter, and no more. It&#x27;s been less then a week and I am sold for life. I would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer and crack repair product!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily on my feet as my heels were so cracked that I was worried about infection.  My feet have healed.  At first I was using it twice a daily and now I use once in the morning.</li>
    <li> I am currently on my second jar.  I apply twice a day and put socks on after.  My toenail is 3/4 grown out with no traces of toenail fungus in new growth.</li>
    <li> It did work some but it has to be used everyday. It works better then anything else I tried.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it really does help with dry heels and other really dry areas on your body.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not making the hard skin on my big toe any softer, still using it and filing but still very, very hard.</li>
    <li> I had keratosis pilaris on arm and thighs  on my second apply i note a big diference after 2 week my arms were clean ... I have to say that i apply this only once a day a srub my skin daily and apply moist cream daily amazing results</li>
    <li> I love it! I cannot rave enough about this product. There was no long wait to see if the product was working; I really noticed the difference on day two. By day eight I could’ve sworn that I had had a foot transplant! The pros: fast and effective, easy to use (very little scrubbing, can be done in daily bath or shower), helps with sweaty feet, not greasy and absorbs quickly, can be used with other products such as Vaseline or antifungal sprays, its diabetic friendly, and it doesn’t require heavy applications (a little goes a long way). Cons: your friends will get sick of you talking about your new miracle find. The price might be a little steep for some; however it’s DEFINITELY worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Great Product, I will reorder.</li>
    <li> Bought this cream after the urea 40 I bought from my podiatrist ran out. This product works just as well, softens the callouses on my feet and loved the added bonus of the brush. Great value.  Will defiantly buy this product again.</li>
    <li> As a former patient at Mayo Clinic dermatology dept, my physician used to prescribe Carmol 40 whose generic version is Urea Cream 40.  It was VERY expensive at the pharmacy and insurance would not cover it.  I had deep cracks in my heels from walking barefoot at year at the pool, occasionally so bad it hurt to walk.  After starting with Urea 40, within a few days I could feel my heels softening.  Slowly the rough layers seemed to slough off and voila, no more cracks.  My 40 year old feet looked like those of a teen.  OK, maybe not quite, but this particular product does exactly as it should.  Just remember to wash your hands after each use or the skin on your hands will start to slough a bit too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No longer requiring a prescription, the price is right and the product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizing lotion for dry feet. My foot dr recommended.</li>
    <li> It does what it supposed to do.  I have very calloused feet that crack and get sore.  This does the job.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. First purchased from my podiatrist.  Now I can&#x27;t live without. Use it regularly and you will have the best looking feet and heels.</li>
    <li> It worked for about 2 weeks, almost too well. Then it stopped working. I quit using it for a week to see if &amp;#34;taking a break&amp;#34; would make it work again, but it continued to be ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were tiny bits of black plastic or rubber in the cream despite it being sealed upon its arrival to my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the Blaine Labs customer line listed on the label to complain, and they were shocked to hear I had purchased their product on Amazon. They informed me that they only sell their product through doctor&#x27;s offices, and that if it is being sold online, it may be bootlegged. That would certainly explain the extremely questionable quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Amazon refunded me.</li>
    <li> Years ago I bought this in my mom&#x27;s foot doctor&#x27;s office &amp; was so happy to find it on Amazon. This is absolutely the best cream on the market! Nothing beats this for dry callous skin, you will be amazed!</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer, I followed the directions and it worked!</li>
    <li> I have Ichthyosis, a genetic skin condition characterized by scaling skin (no two people with the disease look quite the same). It’s as though the old skin cells on parts of my body don’t slough off naturally at the rate that normal skin cells do. In my case, this leads to very thick callouses on my feet and heels. The urea in this cream helps break the bonds that allow my old skin cells to build up. If I put the cream on immediately after taking a bath, my feet are soft and my callouses don’t crack. The texture of the cream is very thick, so you might not want to walk around on a good rug immediately; put on some socks or let the cream soak in for five minutes.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend and all she said it was. Very happy with the product AND the way customer service handled an initial mix-up with my account. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended I find a foot cream that contained Urea for my thick skinned &amp; cracked feet.  She didn&#x27;t have a brand so I went to amazon and searched for a product containing Urea.  This is the best cream for my feet, especially in the cold, dry winter weather.  Its a bit pricy but I live by it  My feet no longer crack and hurt.  The company has prompt delivery and is reliable. I would recommended this product to anyone who has a problem with the skin on their feet.</li>
    <li> Cause it works just as it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;I got results in a week, I&#x27;m happy whit this product!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome. I have psoriasis and it is fabulous used in conjunction w aloe.  It softens and moisturizers dry skin!  Super stuff</li>
    <li> I suffer from cracked feet that are so painful I get large deep cracks that hurt when I walk. I was told by a podiatrist to use this product and my feet were repaired after two applications. The secret is the UREA. Throw all your other products out and purchase this.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that has ever work .</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different lotions, creams and gadgets through the years to help my bleeding, cracking heels.  This product is crazy OUTSTANDING!  My heels healed completely in a matter of weeks.  I wish I had known about it years ago.  Thank you so much.  I will be a lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> a friend of mine received a prescription from her doctor for Urea Cream 40, but he told her to look for this same ingredient at the drug store or Google it…..I found this, but was not impressed with the results I got on my feet….guess I just didn&#x27;t want to go get a pedicure</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job in caring for my calluses</li>
    <li> my podiatrist wrote me a prescription for my dry feet with 40% urea.  This is nearly the same %  at half the cost.  You don&#x27;t even need to apply it every single day,  just use it every other day or so when you get out of the shower when your skin is softest.</li>
    <li> Takes quite a while to work but seems to do the job as advertised in the literature.</li>
    <li> This cream does exactly what it says it does, for once a product that works as expected it would work.</li>
    <li> Melts callouses away slowly but surely.  Use as directed for best results. Does not have an offensive odor and does not stain socks or sheets.</li>
    <li> Seems to help a bit with keratosis pilaris on the backs of the arms (skin is slightly smoother), doesn&#x27;t sting when putting it on, nor does it have a terrible smell, but otherwise has not vastly improved the condition (the bumps can actually become a little rougher for a time as the outer layers get a bit &amp;#34;dried out&amp;#34; ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re using it only every 2 nights or so - to avoid any risk of overdrying - so maybe it just takes a good deal longer to have a more noticeable effect.  I will say that is seems better than other items we&#x27;ve tried.  Even Dermatologists don&#x27;t really have great cures for the condition.</li>
    <li> Good stuff...keeps my damaged feet soft</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I used to purchase from my foot doctor however buying on-line costs less, same product. Mildred</li>
    <li> Works great, boughtvatbpodiatrist office for twice price!</li>
    <li> Got it from my podiatrist and It has stopped the dry skin and calluses.</li>
    <li> Works as well as prescription Urea.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and knew that I liked it.What I liked about what you had was that it was so less expensive than what I had to pay the first time elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Use it twice daily and it worked great.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have found to smooth roughness and keep skin hydrated. The key ingredient is the high urea content which I learned while working for podiatrists.</li>
    <li> I HAVE A SEVERE CASE OF SPLIT AND BLEEDING CALLOUSES AND IT HASN&#x27;T BEEN REAL EFFECTIVE</li>
    <li> this cream is super magic  it worked wonders on my feet&lt;br /&gt;I recommend 200%.  May God Bless who ever created this wonder cream.&lt;br /&gt;My feet were diagnosed acute the worse the doctors  had ever seen.  they told me&lt;br /&gt;there was nothing in the market, that I would have to live for ever both with pain, feet cracking,&lt;br /&gt;bleeding and super heavy callous.  All are gone Thank you I have my life and feet an hands back&lt;br /&gt;thanks to God and to you wonderful people who made and sell this magical product .&lt;br /&gt;Judy G&lt;br /&gt;Florida</li>
    <li> This stuff will remove any extra skin from your feet quick!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this product by mistake (was going for another brand) and decided to try it anyways.  The stars are for the great smell, the wonderful tingle on application and the creaminess of the product. Problem is the next morning, you realize it probably just sits on your face and it is difficult to wash off with an organic cleansing milk product....I think it&#x27;s the simethicone(yikes!). So off to Whole Foods today to get the product I intended to buy (non-gmo).....I did try to use this for about a week....fair trial.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It is easy to use and is effective for removing corn and callus.</li>
    <li> I wanted to thank BlaineLabs for the care and thought that went into formulating an amazing product.  I&#x27;m one of those people who actually READS the ingredients in the food I consume and the products I put on my body, which is why I looked up each and every one of the ingredients on the EWG Cosmetics Database.  All items in RevitaDERM were either a 0 or 1 on a scale of 0 to 9 (i.e., they&#x27;re very, very NON-toxic), a fact I don&#x27;t take for granted.  I wasn&#x27;t surprised that I had to go through a number of urea-based creams on the market before I found a totally NON-toxic solution ... RevitaDERM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I am using RevitaDERM in a way not originally intended.  I have an adult Border Collie who came down with distemper, even though she was vaccinated.  One of the ways that distemper presents is something called &amp;#34;hard pads.&amp;#34;  In a very short period of time huge, debilitating, painfully tender callus builds up on the pads of the dog&#x27;s feet.  My dog has been unable to walk for over a month.  The best way to describe how things must feel to her is if you were to put 2 or 3 marbles in both sneakers and try to walk around on them.  You wouldn&#x27;t take more than a few steps before YOU refused to walk or stand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, she has been successfully treated (using Traditional Chinese Medicine) and is recovering from the virus.  We&#x27;re lucky because most dogs don&#x27;t make it.  Distemper has a 90% fatality rate.  Reducing the cornified tissue (callous) is going to take a bit longer. The pads of her feet are so tender, hot and dry that using a file or pumice stone is NOT an option.  Thankfully, I got my RevitaDERM today, and carefully applied some to each of the pads of her feet.  Then I covered her feet with infant socks to keep her from licking off the product.  Even though I know each ingredient is incredibly safe, it never was intended for internal consumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after one application, I see a noticeable difference.  Her hot, dry calluses really are smoother and not so hot.  Since I&#x27;m trying to get her back on her feet as quickly as possible, I&#x27;ll be reapplying RevitaDERM every 6 hours, which is what I saw recommended on the BlaineLabs website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again, BlaineLabs!  My little Border Collie girl and I are *both* so incredibly appreciative.  I know you don&#x27;t always hear back from your customers, but I have no doubt that you touch a lot of lives in the same way you touched ours.</li>
    <li> Make it easy.  I apply to feet and slip on my socks and head to the gym. It does soften the heels and foot.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle cream. You have to use a stone/grater to remove the dead skin.  I think this is a good product and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had tried all kinds of creams, oils, and ointments to get rid of my scaly, peeling elbows; with little success.  Then I tried the 40% urea cream and my elbows were healed in just a couple of days.  Found it also worKs great on my feet and hands as well.  I like that it comes in a jar  so that none gets wasted.  It is thicker than a lotion, so a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Worked to soften and remove dry skin on my feet.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my doctor and so far, its working well.  I would try other products if i needed to.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother who has been diabetic for 15+ years, she recently started having really bad dry spots on her hands which would not stop peeling no matter what we tried. This was honestly the last hope we had before spending massive money on expensive prescriptions. She&#x27;s been using it every night with gloves while she sleeps, her dry patches are almost completely gone and the cracks caused by the dryness have started closing (something that hasn&#x27;t happened in a long while).&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with something similar should give this a go, with the price it&#x27;s a wonderful product to give a try at.</li>
    <li> I like this but it didn&#x27;t help as much as I thought it would for callouses.</li>
    <li> really works, we got this at the dr office the first time, found it on here much cheaper.</li>
