    <li> I feel this cleans well and does not make me itchy!  I would reccomend to anyone with sensitive skin.  It also has a mild scent.  I was a little apprehensive with &amp;#34;blossom&amp;#34; in the name, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong floral smell at all.  Just fresh and light.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter where you put it (of course not the eyes). There is no stinging what so ever. I have been using it for a while and everything has gone smoothly. I have noticed and improvement and i definalty recommend it if you are looking for a product to clean up.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference or improvement after using this product.  I&#x27;m uncertain how the other reviewers had a different experience.</li>
    <li> Use for one year now never use soap again.  Take a long handle brush put small amount on brush and clean vag.&lt;br /&gt;No more fishy smell ever!

    <li> can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  I have no idea how I used to wash myself with just water!  This is very delicate and always leaves me feeling (and apparently smelling) fresh...and yummy, or so I&#x27;m told. ;)</li>
    <li> This is really nice feminine wash, I will buy it again. It keeps me clean all day. Thank you very much.</li>

BOOM! problem solved!</li>
    <li> Great product! It made me smile I liked it so much I think I cried when it arrived!! Simply AWESOME!</li>

    <li> Keeps things fresh and clean much better then ordinary body wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super sensitive and using regular soap is not an option for me unless I want to itch like crazy! I have tried other washes, but this works very well for me.
