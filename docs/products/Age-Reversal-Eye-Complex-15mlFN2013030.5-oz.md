      <li>Now I am able to use it every night</li>

      <li>My skin responds very well to Vitamin A -Retinol based products</li>
      <li>I keep searching for a really nourishing eye cream, but haven&#x27;t found it.</li>
      <li>They are made from high quality ingredients and this eye cream has retinol in it, which really helps with lines around the corners of my eyes.</li>
      <li>The puffiness and dark circles are so prominent.</li>
      <li>The product was highly recommended to me by salon staff</li>
      <li>and I was worried that I was having a reaction but after a few days the skin stopped peeling and looked better.  </li>

      <li>NON-IRRATING FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t a big fan of this eye cream- found it to absorb well but felt it was much too overpriced and therefore returned it.</li>
      <li>After just over a week of non-use and trying to rehydrate the eye area, I am still not back to normal</li>
      <li>I have used a few of the Dermalogica eye treatments -- total eye care, multivitamin age smart and this age reversal one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used a few of the Dermalogica eye treatments -- total eye care, multivitamin age smart and this age reversal one. they each have very different feels but i honestly feel this one working the best. the total eye care has a tint to it so it also lightens and brightens the area around your eyes. the multivitamin is thicker than the total eye care, about teh same consistency as the age reversal one and i honestly didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. this age reversal one has honestly been the best out of the three. i have not felt any burning or have not needed substantial time for my eyes to get used to it as others have said. i do feel like my eyes are smoother and this honestly does work. i do not have many wrinkles on my eyes but have started to use these eye creams more in a preventative manner. this eye cream although expensive does do a GREAT job. :)</li>
    <li> Tried for a few weeks, did not see any results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M IN MY SIXTIES BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A YEAR AND IT&#x27;S AMAZING. IT SMOOTHS OUT YOUR FINE LINES. NON-IRRATING FOR SENSITIVE SKIN. THE PRICE WAS GREAT CHEAPER THAN ANY STORE . ALSO, THE PRODUCT LINE OF DERMALOGICA  IS ALSO EXCELLENT.  EVERY TIME I GO FOR FACIALS THATS THE PRODUCT THEY USE.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it caused redness and pain under my eyes temporarilty.  More importantly it increased my wrinkles and aged me 20 years.  Most of that has improved as I&#x27;m told the product dehydrated my skin.  After just over a week of non-use and trying to rehydrate the eye area, I am still not back to normal but it is substantially better.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and it does not burn. I have noticed the lines around my eyes are smoother. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any discernable improved changes to the skin around my eyes.  I wanted to wait about 8 weeks before writing a review because over the counter products typically take about that long for users to notice any impact.  The product was highly recommended to me by salon staff but my take is that it may do wonders on some but not all users - it&#x27;s no different than Proactiv: it works on some but not all users.  I will use the remaining amount more as a night moisturizing cream rather than age reversal product but would not purchase it again.  My skin responds very well to Vitamin A -Retinol based products so I will fall back on my standard Roc eye creams.</li>
    <li> This was a extreme waste of money, it was burns and actually makes matters worse, please do not waste your money on this piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream noticeable skin texture change immediate after 1 week</li>
    <li> I really like this product and was able to purchase if from Amazon at a discounted price, which makes if affordable for me.  I love Dermalogica products. They are made from high quality ingredients and this eye cream has retinol in it, which really helps with lines around the corners of my eyes. I followed the instructions, using it every other night for a week or two. Now I am able to use it every night and I have had no adverse reaction to it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Will order again.</li>
    <li> The first couple of times I used this product the skin on my eyelids started to peel off.  Quite a bit at first and I was worried that I was having a reaction but after a few days the skin stopped peeling and looked better.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using this product a few days before some big event because the lids do become very flaky.  Before using this product my eyelids felt rough but after using it they don&#x27;t anymore.  I am hoping to see even better results as I continue to use the eye complex.</li>
    <li> I brought this item based on Health Magazine&#x27;s recommendation. Fortunately, I do not have any lines or wrinkles around my eyes, yet at age 40. I use this product to prevent or slow down the process. Therefore, I do not know if it works or not, yet. I received the product pretty quick from the company. It is much cheaper to buy this product through Amazon compared to buying this product at Ulta or with Dermalogica website. Dermalogica is a good brand.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a big fan of this eye cream- found it to absorb well but felt it was much too overpriced and therefore returned it.</li>
    <li> This really does help the fine lines without adding anything to make it puffy!  It is light and non-greasy and I highly recommend this product!  I really love the Dermalogica products!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product every day since I bought it and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin.  It has been a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I tried this but wasn&#x27;t sold on it.  I keep searching for a really nourishing eye cream, but haven&#x27;t found it.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to the letter, but this product did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small tube was expensive to purchase considering it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, because it might work for someone else, it just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. I have been able to see the difference around my eyes. The puffiness and dark circles are so prominent.</li>
