      <li>This eye mask covers my eyes completely and doesn&#x27;t allow any light in.</li>

    <li> Horrible the mask stars out nice and snug stays on with in a week or so It&#x27;s to loose falls of useless. the neck pillow never stays inflated so it&#x27;s useless ,&amp; the ear plugs don&#x27;t block any sound what&#x27;s so EVER .... the whole thing was a complete rip off I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with amazon product this bad before. Now I have to waste more money on trying another product out but not sure from amazon though .&lt;br /&gt;Katy</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  very useful,  And comfortable</li>
    <li> Love this set. Everything is durable. The sleep mask is comfortable and blocks light great. The earplugs fit great and are comfortable. The neck pillow is comfortable but a little hard to blow up. I love how it can be compacted back down to easily fit in my carry on. I hate having my pillow taking up so much of my space and now I do not have to worry about that with these. I received this to review and all opinions are my honest and unbiased ones.</li>
    <li> The Kingdom Travel kit is a super idea!! We used it on our recent travel journey and it did the job exactly as described. Starting from the eye mask, pillow, ear plugs. And best of all its all packed up in one small pouch easy to carry with. We are recommending this kit for every traveler. Make sure to get one for your next trip.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft and comfort.cheap price but good stuff.But maybe you need a pump instead of mouth...</li>
    <li> My husband and I take a weekend trip about once a month. He likes to drive and I usually end up taking a nap in the passenger&#x27;s seat. Napping in the car isn&#x27;t always an easy or comfortable task. I usually get a kink in my neck and it is hard to get comfortable most times. I was so excited to receive this product at a discount for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;The Kingdom Supplies&#x27; Travel Neck Pillow Set is great for the frequent traveler and is convenient to use on shorter car rides. The pillow fits around the neck comfortably and is velvety soft. It took me less than 2 minutes to blow up. For maximum comfort, I use the pillow and mask together. The eye mask is soft on the face and velcros to fit around the head snuggly and comfortably. It blocks out all light, which is essential to get a good nap while traveling. The eye mask comes with 2 ear plugs. They are great to use when I want to drown out my husband&#x27;s singing drink our car trips :) This is a great travel set and is a great price!!</li>
    <li> Blows up awesome and comfortable</li>
    <li> This is a great idea for a travel neck pillow. If you are looking for a travel neck pillow and eye mask, look no further. This kit is one of the most convenient pillows and eye mask that I have ever had. The pillow meets my requirements and it can be adjusted for different seat configurations or altitude pressures. I use it regularly, and I find it comfortable. I additional, the pillow is inflatable and therefore doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the carry-on once deflated. If I lose it for some reason, I would not hesitate in buying another pillow just like the Kingdom Supplies travel kit I now own.&lt;br /&gt;Sample product for review courtesy of Kingdom Supplies.</li>
    <li> Materials are good but for the first Time when I received the package pillow wasn&#x27;t holding air. It would deflate completely after 20 mins. Anyhow I asked for replacement and got it within 3 days.</li>
    <li> Very nice item. Even though I don&#x27;t use them, the eye mask and ear plugs are great additions. The pillow is comfortable and easily deflates so that I can carry it in a small pocket on my travel back. The drawstring storage bag is also a welcomed edition.</li>
    <li> extremely low quality, I have just trashed it.</li>
    <li> wanted one of these for a while,&lt;br /&gt;love it.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot for my job! Since my car accident I have found the long trips take a toll of my back and neck. In desperation one night I used my sons neck pillow coming back from a ten hour drive home through a snow storm. I have to say it saved the day but I really needed my own pillow. This was a great option for a discounted price because it is tiny tto transport. I can stick it anywhere even my pocket and then blow it up when I need to use it. Perfect for on the go and I can adjust the cushion by letting or filling it with air.</li>
    <li> Super convenient to get all of this in one package and the quality is fine. The pillow has a little texture to it but nothing too funky, it inflates in under a minute and deflates in short time as well. Eye mask is great and has a small flap on the bottom to block light from bleeding in around the tip of your nose, good design. Earplugs are cheap foam but they do holster in nicely to the strap of the eye mask. Everything can fold flat into the pouch provided and be carried in a purse or backpack no problem.</li>
    <li> Every once in a while normally once a year me, my husband, and my son take a road trip to Florida. It takes us about 19 hours if we drive straight without stopping to sleep. This came in handy on our last trip because it gets very uncomfortable sleeping in the car and although we take turns sometimes I will drive at night and him during the day meaning that the son bothers my eyes. This eye mask works great and blocks out a lot of the light and the neck pillow made it more comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions reflected in this review are of my own.</li>
    <li> the material is a bit uncomfortable</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and I think that this a great travel kit to be able to take with me. I usually end up falling asleep on the plane and I wake up with my neck at an awkward angle, so the neck pillow will come in handy. I like that I can blow it up because when it is not inflated, it&#x27;s small enough to fit in my bag. It does take some effort to blow up, but it&#x27;s not too bad. The material is nice and soft against the side of my face. The eye mask is great, since it is never totally dark on the plane. This eye mask covers my eyes completely and doesn&#x27;t allow any light in. The Velcro straps allowed me fit the mask securely to my face without it being too tight. I really like that there is a place to hold the ear plugs right in the strap, so the ear plugs won&#x27;t get lost. All of these things fit into a nice, small pouch that I can easily fit into my carry on bag. I was happy to be able to try this travel kit for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Mask fits well enough to block out most of the light. Ear plugs do not fit small ear canals very well.</li>
    <li> This set is wonderful. The mask is comfortable. The pillow is unexpectedly soft. I didn&#x27;t think it would be because it is a blow up pillow. I would recommend this set for all your travels.</li>
    <li> I plan to give this to a friend of mine that travels a lot. This is a great gift for the consistent traveler. It&#x27;s so convenient because it comes with a pouch that makes it easy to carry with you in your purse...if you&#x27;re a woman, or man purse. Of course, you have to blow up the neck rest, which is fine because it doesn&#x27;t take too long to blow up. Once inflated, it&#x27;s very comfortable with the velvet feel of the topside. The eye mask is of great quality with a satin finish. And it comes with ear plugs too. If you&#x27;re a travel, you know there are times when flying with small kid passengers around can be a little nerve-wrecking. The ear plugs will help drown that noise. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this promotional item I purchased. I missed giving it to my friend before she left for Europe, but I know she will be going on her next adventure in a month and this will definitely come in handy for her.</li>
    <li> For our anniversary in September, my husband and I are taking an 11-day roadtrip down the entire stretch of Route 66. Each day, we will be driving anywhere between six and 12 hours. This means we&#x27;ll probably take several naps in the car (especially on our trip back home when we plan to drive from Las Angeles to Michigan in two days). Although I have no problem falling asleep in the car, I often wake up with a stiff, aching head, neck and shoulders. When I was given the chance to try this eye mask, travel pillow and ear plugs set at a promotional price and share my thoughts, I was thinking this would be a great thing to bring along on our trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave these products a test run during a three-hour car ride to visit family. Even though it was during the day, I couldn&#x27;t tell with the eye mask on my face. That thing blocked out all signs of light and it was super comfy to wear since I was able to easily adjust it to fit my head. The ear plugs were able to block out the radio and the noise of the other three people in the car. I found the travel pillow to be too firm for me if it was inflated all the way, but after releasing some air, it allowed me to enjoy a nice and comfortable nap in the back seat. I felt so refreshed when I woke up, and best part is I didn&#x27;t experience any stiffness!! I&#x27;m excited to use these items on our trip later this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband snapped a photo of me while I was asleep and I didn&#x27;t even know (see attached). Lol.</li>
    <li> I occasionally travel and I like to have the eye mask and neck pillow for my flights. Some other brands out there leave your neck feeling stiff while taking a power nap during travel, but this set is my best friend during travel.  The eye mask is wonderful and comfortable, and I was very excited about the inflatable neck pillow because it would really save space in my carry-on when deflated. The texture is also absolutely wonderful and easy to clean. Good product. I received a sample of this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based upon my own experiences with the product.</li>
    <li> exactly as pictured and even includes ear plugs as well&lt;br /&gt;Everything fits neatly into the included carrying case! Pillow is very easy to inflate and very durable&lt;br /&gt;Eye mask is a high quality material</li>
