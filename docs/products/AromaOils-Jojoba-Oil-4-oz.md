<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I enjoy putting this gentle, moisturizing product on my hands and feet at night before going to bed. I live in a dry climate and spend a lot of time hiking and gardening; thus this product really comes in handy as I find it hard to sleep if my hands or feet feel dry or itchy. I truly appreciate the quality of this product. **I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this oil. I use it on my hands and it does not leave a greasy feel. I can use it in my shampoo a couple times a week for softer hair. A little goes a long way so please do not use a lot in your shampoo. It is also a nice carrier oil for my essential oils and makes a very nice moisturizing massage oil. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because even though it was very securely wrapped there was still a little oil that leaked out onto the outside of the bottle but not enough to even tell any was missing from inside.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It&#x27;s so easy to work with as I use it for my Massage Therapy clients. There&#x27;s no residue or smell after use. I would recommended this to everyone. It is very gentle on skin and worth every cent. When I run out, this is the oil I will definitely be getting again and again!!</li>
    <li> AWESOME! always wanted to try JoJoba, but it can be pricey, this deal was great for such a great product.  I will invest next time.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!!  It is slightly thicker than grapeseed oil, it works as a carrier for essential oils and it is great to infuse vanilla into for a great massage oil.  It is hydrating for the dry skin patches.  I have place vanilla oleorsin into the jojo oil and the oil takes on a wonderful aroma.  I have also used it to mix with cardamom and ginger essential oils for a warming type of oil.  The packaging is great and there were no issues with leakage in shipping.  The bottle comes plastic shrink wrapped with a foil and a solid piece over the neck of the bottle.  The bottle has a flip top opening for ease in use and getting it out of the bottle easily.  I have been using this on my upper neck for the dry skin and it has worked wonderfully,  it absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy like lotions do.  The jojoba oil itself really doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it so it is perfect for people who are scent sensitive or who what to add oils or scents to it. I will definitely purchase again.  I would like to see size options.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the packaging was very secure, there were no spills, I use some for my hair and skin, and I like that it&#x27;s lightweight.  It&#x27;s normally pretty expensive for this oil, so I mix it with other oils, but so far I love it!</li>
    <li> Great oil, love using it with a few drops of lavender or geranium.. my skin is getting so soft, thanks for this oil</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it for my massage oil blends as well as coating my measuring glasses when I&#x27;m making my homemade candles.</li>
    <li> I love Jojoba oil I put it in the freezer to cool it them beat it with my mixer and it makes whipped Jojoba butter a must try also great for summer time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve incorporated the AromaOils Jojoba Oil into my arsenal of carrier oils for essential oil blends and it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this oil.  Just a little on your skin will hydrate and make it feel soft and baby smooth.  I am looking forward to using this oil in my lotions and other cosmetics.  I would certainly buy this oil again</li>
    <li> This is a great oil at a great price!</li>
    <li> Silky smooth, great for what I needed.</li>
    <li> This worked just as well as my last bottle of Jojoba Oil!  Works great as a carrier oil for my essential oils</li>
    <li> I use jojoba oil in my skin care products and soaps. This is a great product. Came nicely packaged (no leaking!) and arrived quickly (a huge bonus). Seems like a very high quality product, with the skin loving properties I love in jojoba.</li>
    <li> I am trying it on my daughter she has eczema and her skin gets really try 2 night and her skin is soft a lil goes a long way</li>
    <li> I used this to make a mixture to spray on my dogs dry skin!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Good for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Good quality super fast shipping! Great item!</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly.  Wonder oil.  It has helped by daughter&#x27;s hair become more manageable.</li>
    <li> I have curly and thick hair, and live in a humid place, freeze is a big issue for me.  I got the oil yesterday, apply a bit as soon as I got it, and I could not believe it no freeze.&lt;br /&gt;Did it again this morning, my hair is shiny, no freeze, and no weighted down.  If you have straight hair might be different for you, but if you have curly hair you might want to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I been adding this in my body wash, n I got to say I love the result n it saves me a lot of times. I use to have to apply lotion after I shower, but by adding this jojoba oil into my body wash, after I shower my skin is soft n hydrated, so I don&#x27;t have to apply lotion after shower. I did also add a few drops for my dog when I bath them n their coat becomes soft n fluffy n their skin is also not as dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HOBEST REVIEW***</li>
    <li> Received this yesterday, Love it!  Excellent quality.  Used it for an after bath moisturizer.  My skin is so soft.  Would highly recommend it.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it with some of my oils.</li>
    <li> This jojoba oil is great. I use it for moisturizing as well as for my DIY health and beauty recipe&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> Jojoba Oil is WONDERFUL to keep my skin soft and also works great to manage my hair!  A little goes along way!</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a must have item. I recommend this product because of the way it made my skin feel and the pleasant aroma it has. I will be ordering more of it in the future.</li>
    <li> Smells like my first bottle of Jojoba oil, which I like, and has a nice golden color.  Mixes well with my essential oils as I need it and wanted it to.</li>
    <li> Received the bottle pretty quick and well packaged, I also received emails from Jojoba directly which is nice. However, after I opened the seal on the top, put the cap back on, the oil would not come out the way it should be. It leaks from the closing edge when I squeeze the bottle, the cap doesn&#x27;t work, that was a small disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is wonderful, I tried if on my hair today and it looks shinny, not oily at all. Pretty good products. Thanks for the great deal.</li>
    <li> smooth on the skin and smells like heaven!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Great for hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to jojoba oil. So far I like a lot. My skin feels smooth and silky after using. You don&#x27;t need much!!  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been only using the oil for a short time and already I notice that my skin is softer and less dry. The delivery was fast and prompt and the company sent me an e-mail with great recipes for using the oil! Love it</li>
    <li> I love this Jojoba Oil, it make my hair and skin so shining and silky. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this as a carrier with EO&#x27;s, working out perfectly.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite oils!  I love that I can mix a little of this in with all of my current creams and lotions to make them even more moisturizing or use it straight from the bottle on my skin or even my hair.  This  beautiful oil has a very, very soft nutty kind of scent, so will not interfere with anything you mix it with, or clash with your favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  I really like how quickly it is absorbed by the skin, and how long it moisturizes. I only used a few drops on my legs in the morning, and they still felt soft and smooth in the evening. The oil is a great carrier for essential oils, due to its neutral fragrance. I&#x27;m new to essential oils, but compared to other carrier oils I have used, I am enjoying the Jojoba the most. I also added a few drops to my shampoo, and my hair is softer and smoother, and has not been as unruly as it usually is. I would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Such a lovely product for this weather ! Jojoba oil is very close to how our skin is in it&#x27;s natural state (the sebum glands). Using this chemical free formula is lovely ! Use it on babies, under area, private parts that itch and so on. I have too many uses for this product. I have stopped using any types of chemicals on my body. My wife uses it on her complete body right after showering. She uses this jojoba oil and swaps it with argon oil twice a week. Her skin is radiant. Until something itches, I don&#x27;t reach for this. But jojoba oil any day over chemical creams.</li>
    <li> I used this oil to make a facial scrub. Loved it!!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil. Exactly what I needed. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my very dry feet. Well my feet loves this and then I used on my arms. I will buy this again</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipment.</li>
    <li> great product&#x3D;will buy again and super duper fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love it and how it mixes.</li>
    <li> I  pour some in my conditioner bottle and my leave hair is way shinier. I also add some to my leave in products and use it prior to bow drying my hair. Hair is not frizzy or oily afterwards.I like it!</li>
    <li> Great Moisturizer...love it</li>
    <li> Enjoying the oil. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Great oil. no smell.  Cold pressed.  Will work great in my essential oil blends.</li>
    <li> Great oil! I used as a carrier for essential oils and in homemade lotion and other skin/haircare. I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant scent and absorbs nicely.  Love the bottle and it dispenses the perfect amount. I put it on bare skin or add a drop or two to my regular moisturizer. The seller was wonderful in their communication which equals great customer service in my book.</li>
    <li> Quality product.  Works great for skin or hair.</li>
    <li> smells so nice and feels great on my skin</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product!  The first challenge was with the packaging, the bottle was leaking,the safety seal was broken and the black cap was blocked on the inside by what looked like another seal (I could not remove it from the cap to use the cap properly) this is a bad start especially  when it comes to a carrier oil for very expensive essential oils. Second I did not care for the smell, it smelled like a store bought vegetable cooking oil to me. Lastly I thought it was to heavy and &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; for a carrier oil, it left my skin feeling like it was greasy.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my Jojoba oil. It&#x27;s an amazing oil. Lightweight, non-greasy and easily absorbs into the skin with little effort. It also has a very natural and pleasant smell. I will be buying another bottle once this one is finished. I am using it for massage, in my bath and to moisturise my face. I alternate every now and then with Vit E oil which is my main facial oil.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am LOVING this oil I hacve been using Grapeseed Oil as my carrier for Essential Oil&#x27;s since Jan. ofthis year. I opened this up and used it on my face as soon as it got here and again that night and the past few nights it has left my face feeling wonderful. No complaints here will definitely be looking into ordering more in the future and will tell all my Essential oil using friends about this brand of Jojoba Oil! Shipping was very fasy and I was so excited how fast time came.</li>
    <li> Love all the uses and its helping my flakey nails so much</li>
    <li> I love this I use this on my face as a moisturizer and also mix it in with my face cream</li>
    <li> I used the oil on my hand to keep them from winder dryness. The quality is good. It is good for winter. Not sure for the summer since it is a bit of thick. Good quality.</li>
    <li> OMG I added this oil to my body wash and my skin is baby soft. I love this oil, and it great directly on the skin too, without skin feeling oily and slimy. Love this oil :)</li>
    <li> Great oil love how it makes my skin and hair so soft.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a 100% jojoba oil and I love it. I always put some on my hair after washing it and my hair is getting stronger and healthier. If you are the one who cares about your hair, you should try it and I believe you will love it too.</li>
    <li> It is just what it is described! I like to mix this oil with my other flavored oils! But you can also put it in your hair and on your face! There is a smell.. But nothing bad just kind of plain. *i received this with a promotional discount*</li>
    <li> Love it...great carrier oil for my Young living Essential Oils!  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I love this oil. The product is light and does not weight my hair down.</li>
    <li> It is a great product with multiple uses! I usually used it as hair products- to massage my scalp and hair tip before I washed my hair and it would make my hair smooth and stronger. I also add one drop into my foundation before I applied it on my face (I have very dry skin and I live in desert) and it would make my skin more moisturized. I also tried mix it with sugar and used the mixture as body scrub- and I love it. Definitely a must-have products you should have in your list!</li>
    <li> Will update my review after tried it</li>
    <li> I love this jojoba oil. make my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> HiI ordered this for my daughter and we are both very pleased with the jojoba oil.  We were both impressed that you followed up on the order personally and sent a list of all the things we could use it for.  A wonderful product and we will order other products from you as well as we need them.  I highly recommend your company.Sincerely,Joan</li>
    <li> The oil is fine, but the package has problem.  It leaked.</li>
    <li> I leave  this jojoba oil  on  my night stand  table , so it would come handy.  Love this jojoba oil, would buy it again...</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Wrapped very well,  super price for a review and even to purchase at regular price.  So happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It&#x27;s pure, clean, fresh. It mixes well as a carrier oil for my Essential oil blends. It works well as a skin care product. It arrived promptly and well packaged. I will definitely purchase from this company when I reorder.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have been given a deep discount on this product in exchange for my honest review. I am using this oil in my homemade body butter. It is a wonderful addition to it. 100% pure jojoba oil it has vitamin e in it do it is great for wrinkles and stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I just used this oil for the first time and WOW. It feels silky going on and my skin feels wonderful. I have VERY DRY skin and even after 1 hour stll no flakes. Every other product I have used I would get flakes after a hour or two. Will buy again and recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! It is a little thicker then some I have bought, but thats what I was looking for! Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a large bottle of 100% pure Jojoba Oil. It arrived quickly, and I have already added some to my favorite shampoo. It is scentfree, so it works wonderfully to soften and moisturize without changing the smell. I plan to use it on my dry skinned dog as soon as it gets warmer. This bottle will last a long time, and is well worth the order!</li>
    <li> Great product! Very good quality. Love using it with my essential  oils.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this product is extremely hydrating to your skin - I used this as a skin moisturizer directly on my arms and legs.  A little bit of this product goes a LONG way, so this bottle will last a long time!  I do like the fact that there is very little scent to this product, even though I wouldn&#x27;t mind it if there was a light scent. I also like the fact that this product is 100% natural with nothing else added to it.</li>
    <li> I only received this yesterday so I haven&#x27;t used it too much yet. When I opened it I accidentally spilled a little (more than a little) on my hands. I just rubbed it all in. I was not left greasy and I was super soft the rest of the day. Even after washing my hands several times. The odor is very neutral as well. I look forward to making a nice essential oil blend with it for my face.</li>
    <li> great product.  Not too oily.  Blends well with essential oils and does not contribute a strong odor.  I have not used other Jojoba oil, so I do not know how it compares.  I have very dry skin, and this helps matters significantly.</li>
    <li> packaging seem pretty good but it leaked anyway :( other than that.. it&#x27;s a good size and i love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great &amp;#34;carrier&amp;#34; oil and also a wonderful oil for massaging the scalp and eliminating dry, frizzy hair.  If you massage a small amount into your scalp and let it sit for a while before washing, your hair will be soft and frizz free.  The humidity won&#x27;t be so damaging to your hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I love jojoba oil, to me it works and smells better than some argon oil or rosehip seed oil that I have used. This one is not exception. It is such a great quality oil. My hair is so smooth and it fixes my dry end right away. My hair feels &amp;#34;hydrated&amp;#34; all day, or even the third day. I got it at a discount for a review, I definitely will recommend this oil to everyone. Love it.</li>
    <li> Good oil, I use it on my hair. after use it only once, my hair became smooth and shine</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil!  I use it at night with a mixture of a couple essential oils on my face and when I wake up in the morning my face feels so smooth!  I will definitely continue to purchase this and make sure I never run out..</li>
    <li> Great product, loves it!</li>
    <li> Love jojoba oil for everything on my body. This was a great value and product</li>
    <li> The ArmoaOils 100% pure Jojoba oil make my skin soft and my hair so smooth.  It feel so great! I will strong recommend to my friend.  But I think the packing need imporove.  When I received the bottle. the oil come out. make me spend time to clean it.</li>
    <li> Great package. Basically jojoba oil is good to be used in many ways. I just got the bottle and already put on my skin for moisture. I suggest the company to make it drip bottle instead of open &amp; pour design. Somehow it&#x27;s hard to control the amount and leak. Overall, I am pretty satisfied with the quality.</li>
    <li> I have partially dry and flaky skin on my face, and I applied few drops of this Jojoba oil on it, it immediately moist my skin and last all night long, still feels nice and soft. No irritation which is the best part! Love it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have been using the AromaOils for about two weeks.  I&#x27;ve used it on my skin and hair and have noticed significant difference on both.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair along with my usual conditioner, every other day.  My hair does feel soft and &#x27;bouncy&#x27;.  When I applied it on my back, which usually gets very dry, the skin feels soft and moist, and I don&#x27;t need to re-apply it for another 2 or 3 days.  This oil is very light, although I accidentally put too much on my hair once, it does weigh my hair down and it looks like I hadn&#x27;t shampoo my hair for a while (so don&#x27;t use too much of it at once or rinse well!).  :)</li>
    <li> Excellent item, speedy shipping, thanks.A+++</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Purchased to use with my essential oils as a carrier oil and it works perfectly for this use.</li>
    <li> I received a discount price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This oil smells very good. I used it for massage and it is easy to absorb by my skin. I felt my skin is smooth after using it. I love this jojoba oil. I think it is one of the best I ever had.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and well packaged. This oil is very light weight but moisturize skin well, when I rubbed a couple drops of them on my hair, it makes my frizzy hair smooth and shine, yet don&#x27;t look oily</li>
    <li> Tends to dry out my face around the mouth/chin area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought jojoba oil before. I got this for making lotions with my essential oils and using as a carrier oil. I like it, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Perfect for anyone who has dry skin, I used it as a body oil and it soften the skin and keep the moisture  in the skin</li>
    <li> Am very satisfied with this jojoba oil - I&#x27;ve used it mostly as a carrier for essential oils but also as a skin moisturizer and it works really well. Am anxious to try it on my hair as well.</li>
    <li> Works great in my hair! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad there is no strong scent to this oil. I add it to my conditioner for extra softness.</li>
    <li> Love the oil, we use it on the skin and hair and feel great and we love the scent! Definitely will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The smell is pretty good, some how I really like it, and I used it on my face and feel very good! like it!&lt;br /&gt;If it can be glass bottle would be better!</li>
    <li> This oil came packaged very securely! I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews that adding a small amount to your shampoo adds moisture to dry hair. So I decided to try that even though I originally purchased this as a mixing agent for some essential oils I also bought. It does work wonders! I can already tell a difference in my usually dry ends. I still plan to use this for the reason I originally sought it out-to use with the essential oils. So I&#x27;ll update my review once I do. I also appreciated the follow up by the seller. He seemed very eager to make sure I was pleased with the product, and that if I wasn&#x27;t, what he could do to fix any issues. I assured him, so far..so good and thanked him for his concern. I would recommend this product.</li>
