      <li>she gets it works good or not.</li>

      <li>Great product easy to use.</li>
      <li>This volumizing powder is by far the best styling product I have found for my hair, ever!</li>
      <li>Amazing volume for fine hair, I love it!</li>
      <li>I like it ok.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a \\&quot;grippy\\</li>
      <li>and it gives it a lot more texture and makes it look thicker.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It also makes my hair a bit more matte, but this is also acceptable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This powder is absolutely fantastic if you are trying to make a cheer poof!</li>
      <li>Perfect for when I don&#x27;t have enough time to shower before work.</li>
      <li>Like the Psssst powder better</li>
      <li>I just put some wearable conditioner or oil in the ends to deter the static.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s probably something better</li>
      <li>And I love it.</li>
      <li>It is not miraculous, but it sure helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But, it also creates static.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE me some volume.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>My hair is pretty fine and this stuff works great.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other hair volumizing powders to compare, but not your mother&#x27;s has been so awesome I haven&#x27;t needed to!</li>
      <li>It is easy to over-do it, so be light handed.</li>
      <li>It works fine</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s oomph, and there&#x27;s looking like you&#x27;ve stuck your finger in a light socket.</li>
      <li>So far so good, helps with bolume</li>
      <li>I first tried the sea salt spray from this brand and loved it so much that I thought I should give this a try!</li>
      <li>Perfect product for flat hair, makes it so much easier to tease</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this gives it body for special occasion styling.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight hair, and a pixie cut.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think that is actually true.</li>
      <li>This is great for adding body and a little hold for styling.</li>
      <li>the whole purpose of this product is that you do not have to do that, no damage right!</li>
      <li>It only requires a very light dusting to achieve increased volume.  </li>
      <li>Perfect of your hair goes flat when you don&#x27;t wan it to.</li>
      <li>It gives your hair more resistance so it doesn&#x27;t just slide back into place against your scalp.  </li>
      <li>but I had to use more for the same effect</li>
      <li>downside to this is that it makes your hair FEEL funny.  </li>
      <li>I never thought my hair could have so much volume (that lasts all day)!</li>
      <li>If you have the extra $$ buy Cake Satin Sugar Hair and Body refreshing powder.</li>
      <li>when I opened package, small amount spilled out, so that left me with even less, the product works great, and it doesn&#x27;t take much, holds great bunny bumps, up dos, and vintage hair styles.</li>
      <li>If I can remember to put extra on before I go to bed, the next morning my hair really looks pretty good for a non-shampoo day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>Anyway, I use this for pretty much all my updos</li>
      <li>Others left my hair looking a bit greasy looking somehow, and I don&#x27;t need any help in that department as my hair gets oily very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super fine and caused static and made my head itch, hair looked dull and old, unclean.</li>
      <li>It works really well for texturizing, scrunching, and volumizing.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Using a touch of this really provided lift without teasing or wasting a lot of time with a hair dryer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>you do NOT need much at all.</li>
      <li>Much nicer scent and doesn&#x27;t remove all your shine.</li>
      <li>Girl friend wants it.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that tends to go flat at the roots.</li>
      <li>I could barely get a brush through it, which I suppose was a good thing, since brushing made the static far worse.</li>
      <li>and you can put it in daily, gives every hair style that extra oomf I love it so much!</li>
      <li>I regularly use the Batiste and Algemarin dry shampoos on clean hair to give it a bit more volume and decided to give this a try to see if it would provide a little more oomph.</li>
      <li>Though if you  are wanting to not use all those chemicals usually found in regular hair products, this works great.</li>
      <li>the price is high so that means she wants it</li>
      <li>This powder does a decent job of lifting at the roots.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The sticky feeling some other reviewers mention, it&#x27;s a different kind of \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; than you would get with a wax, for example.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s terrific for my short fine straight hair to get some funky lift and texture.</li>
      <li>So, since most people do not go around feeling my hair, but only look at it, I decided that the strange texture was an acceptable tradeoff.  </li>
      <li>Though for those of you who just wanted this to be normal volumizing powder, this is not the powder for you most likely; it does give your hair a dry and sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>Eventually it&#x27;ll fall flat again but you can easily just tease the roots again for instant volume.</li>
      <li>My hair is very think and straight, but it lays completely flat against my head.  </li>
      <li>OK, so I did not love this powder.</li>
      <li>and so it works fine with the slight oils.</li>
      <li>I have very fine and thin hair, stick straight.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite volumizing powder, after trying several different (and more expensive) brands.  </li>
      <li>I will stick with my old volumizing routine from now on.</li>
      <li>like I said in the beginning, if you don&#x27;t use too much, your hair is definitely still malleable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve discovered that I cannot have both soft shiny hair, and lots of volume.  </li>
      <li>I have really fine, thin hair that I have never been able to do anything with (whether my hair is short or long).  </li>
      <li>I like to have a small &amp;#34;proof&amp;#34; on the top back part ow my hair</li>
      <li>this stuff really pumps it up...be careful to only apply to roots its very sticky and unbrushable..</li>
      <li>I got exactly as described, arrived before expected date.</li>

    <li> OK, so I did not love this powder. I love dry shampoos and wanted this to work, but it makes your hair feel so dry and stiff, it&#x27;s not worth the feeling in your hair for the volume.</li>
    <li> Hate how it feels, but love the volume.</li>
    <li> Girl friend wants it. she gets it works good or not. the price is high so that means she wants it</li>
    <li> Ugh!  I do not like this product at all.  Before using it, I watched a couple of &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; videos on YouTube so I believe I was using the product correctly.  However, I hated the sticky mess it left in my hair.  Fortunately, I only used the product on a small amount of hair so was able to comb it out once it dried.  Price so small that I&#x27;ll just toss it rather than send it back.</li>
    <li> Love all of their products! This one I just started using. So far so good, helps with bolume</li>
    <li> Like the Psssst powder better but I would get this one again.</li>
    <li> I have very fine and thin hair, stick straight.  This is my favorite volumizing powder, after trying several different (and more expensive) brands.  Others left my hair looking a bit greasy looking somehow, and I don&#x27;t need any help in that department as my hair gets oily very quickly.  A few sprinkles of this, mushed into my roots, and my hair has some volume and texture.  It is not miraculous, but it sure helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this is that it makes your hair FEEL funny.  Kinda coarse and gritty, and more difficult to brush.  But I&#x27;ve discovered that I cannot have both soft shiny hair, and lots of volume.  So, since most people do not go around feeling my hair, but only look at it, I decided that the strange texture was an acceptable tradeoff.  It also makes my hair a bit more matte, but this is also acceptable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other perk, is that this product helps me shampoo my hair less often.  I have been told by numerous stylists not to shampoo every day, but as my hair is so oily it is really hard for me to do that.  Using this product makes my hair seem less oily the next day.  If I can remember to put extra on before I go to bed, the next morning my hair really looks pretty good for a non-shampoo day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this gives it body for special occasion styling. However it also gives hair a sticky feel which I am not fond of, so I would definitely not use it for everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Perfect product for flat hair, makes it so much easier to tease and you can put it in daily, gives every hair style that extra oomf I love it so much!</li>
    <li> Works fine but do not use too much or it can make the texture of your hair feel weird. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it gave me lasting volume though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this did to my hair, but was definitely something pretty bad. My previously clean shiny hair became instantly dull, ratty, and horribly static-y — static like I&#x27;ve never experienced in my life, every tiny hair on my head sticking straight up and numerous strands of the long hair on my head actually floating out to the sides and back in mid-air, and it was giving off loud crackles and pops. I could barely get a brush through it, which I suppose was a good thing, since brushing made the static far worse. I regularly use the Batiste and Algemarin dry shampoos on clean hair to give it a bit more volume and decided to give this a try to see if it would provide a little more oomph. There&#x27;s oomph, and there&#x27;s looking like you&#x27;ve stuck your finger in a light socket. Just, no.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Wish Wal-Mart still sold it.  I like to have a small &amp;#34;proof&amp;#34; on the top back part ow my hair and this does the trick.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and fine...this stuff really pumps it up...be careful to only apply to roots its very sticky and unbrushable..also dull and whitish. I use a gloss spray over it. There&#x27;s probably something better I just hate experimenting though.</li>
    <li> Great product easy to use. Only downside is it makes my hair feel dirtier faster than when I don&#x27;t use it. But I appreciate that I can keep &amp;#34;refreshing &amp;#34; my volume all day</li>
    <li> This powder is not only messy but it also makes your hair feel chalky and gross. It&#x27;s not worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that tends to go flat at the roots. A few sprinkles of Girl Powder and my hair instantly has texture and lift! Before using this I had to wash my hair everyday (tough on the follicles) because my hair looked so limp but with Girl Powder I have found I can go a day or two with a few spritz of lavender water to freshen my hair up. Great product!</li>
    <li> Awful.... just awful. I&#x27;ll start by saying I have thick heavy blonde hair and I LOVE me some volume. I usually use baby powder to soak up oily roots (which is a common occurrence for me)This made it unbearable to touch my hair. It gave my hair a horrible gritty sticky texture and made it completely unmanageable. I shampooed my hair twice to try to get it out but I still had a coating on my roots. Terrible.. going straight in the trash.</li>
    <li> I do like this product, I gave it a 3, when I received the bottle I thought it was empty, so I did the math, 0.21 oz not even an 1full ounce, little less than 1/4 of ounce, of course when I opened package, small amount spilled out, so that left me with even less, the product works great, and it doesn&#x27;t take much, holds great bunny bumps, up dos, and vintage hair styles. After 3 weeks, it was gone, used total of 4 times. I was really disappointed with the amount. CONSUMER  BEWARE,  the price seems great, but make sure you look at the volume you are getting, do the math. I emailed the seller, they emailed me back, read side of box, everything I explained above. I got exactly as described, arrived before expected date. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This volumizing powder is by far the best styling product I have found for my hair, ever! I have very fine, straight hair, and a pixie cut. I have tried sprays, creams, waxes, texturizers, pomades, gels, and even anther powder, and nothing has worked as well as this! The sticky feeling some other reviewers mention, it&#x27;s a different kind of \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; than you would get with a wax, for example. It&#x27;s more of a \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; feeling, if that makes sense. It works really well for texturizing, scrunching, and volumizing. The grippy feeling fades away after a while, but it still leaves the texture, and you can still scrunch it and play with it to get your desired effect. Some reviewers said that the bottle was half empty when they purchased it. I don&#x27;t think that is actually true. It would be impossible to tell, as the powder is completely weightless and the packaging is opaque so there is no way to see or feel how full it is. A tiny bit goes a long way though. I use mine every day, and it still seems like there is plenty after two months.&lt;br /&gt;I was using osis dust it powder for a while, but compared with this, it is just not as good. That one has a strange cold feeling when applied, and it made me break out. I haven&#x27;t tried any other hair volumizing powders to compare, but not your mother&#x27;s has been so awesome I haven&#x27;t needed to!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive product that works as well as Aveda</li>
    <li> Perfect of your hair goes flat when you don&#x27;t wan it to. Just scrunch at the root and you&#x27;re good to go again. Perfect buy. Cannot find in stores</li>
    <li> Perfect for when I don&#x27;t have enough time to shower before work. Adds great volume. be careful though- you do NOT need much at all. Too much will give your hair a half can of hairspray feel</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair that will not keep volume no matter what I have tried, until this product!  I can get long lasting volume with this product year round!  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  When you sprinkle it directly on your roots, it provides instant volume and texture.  It lasts all day too.  It is easy to over-do it, so be light handed. This works just as good as the 25$ stuff I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;ve tried a few other cheaper versions of hair \\&quot;powder\\&quot; and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have relatively thin, very fine hair. This powder does a decent job of lifting at the roots. Eventually it&#x27;ll fall flat again but you can easily just tease the roots again for instant volume. However, a little goes a very long way so make sure not to be too heavy handed. Also it gives your hair this weird, sticky texture which I&#x27;m not too fond of.</li>
    <li> Was not overly impressed.</li>
    <li> The bottle came opened and powder was everywhere. Who knows if it works or not. I like their other products, so I thought I would try this. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this online since Walmart was out of the Got2b hair powder. It works fine but I had to use more for the same effect and I used the entire thing in no time. So I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> just use a little bit at the roots, and your flat hair will come to life! My hair is pretty fine and this stuff works great. So great that I gave some to my sister for a gift, who has even thinner hair than I do.</li>
    <li> I was using got2be Powder&#x27;ful, and I loved it, but I couldn&#x27;t verify that it was not tested on animals.  This is the same stuff, only slightly finer.  It&#x27;s terrific for my short fine straight hair to get some funky lift and texture. And it&#x27;s a cruelty-free company, yay!</li>
    <li> I can see how this volumizes being that once you put it in your hair you can&#x27;t run your fingers through it. It actually made my hair stick together as if it had been teased with tons of hairspray. I had to throw the bottle away since I could barely run a brush through it after applying. I will stick with my old volumizing routine from now on.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This powder is absolutely fantastic if you are trying to make a cheer poof! Though for those of you who just wanted this to be normal volumizing powder, this is not the powder for you most likely; it does give your hair a dry and sticky feeling. However, if you want to make a poof without a product such as a bump-it, then this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> My bottle came opened and was half empty, very disappointed I guess I just have to go to the beauty store and get my new unpacked bottle from there!</li>
    <li> Love the product! You really only need very little of the product in a few sections of your head- it does last all day and go to Wal-Mart- I paid only $4.24 for the same size bottle.  Like another reviewer said, the bottle came half empty, but I&#x27;m not sure if that is really the case; the product is so fine and light that I think it appears to be half-empty, when it really is not.</li>
    <li> Great hair product. Little does go a long way!!</li>
    <li> Awesome price and great shipping. Not Your Mothers&#x27;s Products are the best hair products you can buy.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery. Thank You!</li>
    <li> If you find this product is too sticky or makes it impossible to run fingers through your hair, you&#x27;ve probably used too much.  It only requires a very light dusting to achieve increased volume.  My hair is very think and straight, but it lays completely flat against my head.  Using a touch of this really provided lift without teasing or wasting a lot of time with a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You definitely feel like you have product in your hair, but that&#x27;s essentially how it works.  It gives your hair more resistance so it doesn&#x27;t just slide back into place against your scalp.  I have a habit of constantly running my fingers through my hair (which is why teasing isn&#x27;t an option for me), so I knew if this prevented that then I wouldn&#x27;t use it, but like I said in the beginning, if you don&#x27;t use too much, your hair is definitely still malleable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just use it at the roots!  I can&#x27;t imagine putting this all over your hair.  It would feel terrible, and you&#x27;d get insane tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those wondering about the appearance of powder, my hair is a dark auburn shade but the white powder completely disappears after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
    <li> But, it also creates static. Though if you  are wanting to not use all those chemicals usually found in regular hair products, this works great. I just put some wearable conditioner or oil in the ends to deter the static.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to describe, definitely not the normal powder. It&#x27;s super fine and caused static and made my head itch, hair looked dull and old, unclean. If you have the extra $$ buy Cake Satin Sugar Hair and Body refreshing powder. Much nicer scent and doesn&#x27;t remove all your shine.</li>
    <li> I have really fine, thin hair that I have never been able to do anything with (whether my hair is short or long).  I first tried the sea salt spray from this brand and loved it so much that I thought I should give this a try! It works great! I never thought my hair could have so much volume (that lasts all day)! A little goes a long way! Try it! You&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> Works well on my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Feels super tacky and the smell is a little annoying.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands profile, but as the wife, I&#x27;m the one who uses this stuff. And I love it. It doesn&#x27;t have any Aluminum, which would be a deal breaker for me. It does make your hair slightly static(y), but I usually use it on &amp;#34;not that clean&amp;#34; hair and so it works fine with the slight oils. Anyway, I use this for pretty much all my updos so my hair stays where I want it and it gives it a lot more texture and makes it look thicker.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is too bad that you do not see it in stores anymore.  This is great for adding body and a little hold for styling.</li>
    <li> I like it ok.  It does help pouf up my hair a bit.  You only need to use a tiny amount.  Use too much and your hair looks dull and feels icky.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It works like it says it will but be careful not to use too much of it or your hair will get sticky. I increases the volume, but the reason I gave it three stars is because you will have to wash your hair before the end of the day because it will be stuck together and flat. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single day or it will become too dry and this requires me to wash it after each use, but for a night out when I want more voluminous hair its a great go-to!</li>
    <li> This product is magic! Amazing volume for fine hair, I love it!</li>
    <li> This will lift your roots, give you volume, and/or aid in creating a messy, tousled look. But you will need to pair it with another product. It can make your hair color look dull, the more you use, so pair it with a wax or something similar, even shine mist. Also know that a little goes a long way and you may have to shampoo your hair twice the next morning to get it all out. Great price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - I use it almost ever day.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used one other powder volumizer, Aveda, so this product did not really stand up to Aveda. I know that these powders are sticky and that is part of their volumizing powder, but this one just sits there, being sticky and not really bumping. I know a lot of people said to backcomb but the whole purpose of this product is that you do not have to do that, no damage right! This powder added a little volume, but not much. My head mainly felt sticky and heavy all day.</li>
    <li> Such a strange concoction of substance.  It&#x27;s very hard to manipulate your hair and all I can say is... &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this at all.  No matter how little I use, it&#x27;s just to gummy in my hair.  Makes my hair look dull, and by the end of the day, it looks and feels like it has been weeks since I washed my hair.</li>
    <li> This hair powder makes your hair super sticky and there is no way to maneuver a comb through it which means you are left with uneven bumps all over your hair and if you try to comb it out, half of your hair will come out.  Not good at all.</li>
