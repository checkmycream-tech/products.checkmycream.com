<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This did moisturize my face but did not notice an improvement in lines or wrinkles</li>
    <li> I just want to know why I have never heard of this before! Within two weeks of using this, I can see a difference in my decades-old skin, and even more delightful in my wrinkled throat! My pores are getting smaller, and my skin seems to be tighter. I use this only at night, and am about to try it as a foundation for my makeup.  I use very little, as just one pump us enough for my face. Yes, it us expensive, but not ridiculously so--</li>
    <li> I like this product. BUT- too small a bottle for the price for me. I used way too much too quickly. My fault, not company. Definitely saw a difference in just a few days.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I had hoped. I have other creams that work better for less money.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not one of those women looking for the fountain of youth, I&#x27;m quite happy with and proud of nice, albeit aging skin. I tried this moisturizer to see if the claims about the contents as being ideal for aging skin were true. Having used the entire contents, my skin definitely feels and looks better. It&#x27;s brighter, clearer and cleaner looking. This moisturizer is quite nice, not oily, thick or sticky feeling. Compared to the super expensive stuff, this worked better for my skin and it&#x27;s my only moisturizer now. As for the anti-aging claim, I suppose it&#x27;s true...at least I don&#x27;t have any new wrinkles!</li>
    <li> It smells like menthol and pretty sticky (</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin in just a few weeks BUT the bottle broke the first time I used it. The pump never worked and so I have to scoop the cream out with a finger or a Q-tip (and the top of the bottle is narrow, so not ideal). I would love to buy again (and again and again) but the bottle issue is a problem for sure.</li>
    <li> No difference in my skin.  Going back to my organic oils. Too pricey!</li>
    <li> I work at a different cosmetic line, but my skin was in need of something we didn&#x27;t have. I didn&#x27;t know what I needed, but I wanted smooth, hydrated skin that didn&#x27;t look damaged and rough. So I tried this ONCE. And my skin was so soft I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it! It is not that expensive compare to others, It&#x27;s been a long time since something&#x27;s turned my head. There&#x27;s a price, but it can help slow the signs of aging. Can you really put a price on that?</li>
    <li> I dont know what everyone is baffled about but this doesnt do anything in terms of &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34;. Yes, it does make your face look fresh, brighter, moist, but I can get that from basically many otc products. I got this for anti aging and after using a while, it hasnt done any improvements on face(not even tiny wrinkles or lines). Im trying Olay anti aging right now and I&#x27;ll see if that does any good.</li>
    <li> As someone that is always on the look out for amazing skincare products that will keep my skin looking and feeling healthy, I was so excited to receive this Vernal Anti-Aging moisturizer in the mail!! After testing this moisturizer out for my self I have to say this moisturizer is way better then moisturizer I have tried in the past!!!This moisturizer made my skin feel amazing &amp; look healthy!!This moisturizer permanently eliminates appearance of fine lines and wrinkles., Increases skin tone and elasticity, Provides structural lift and reduction of wrinkles,Boosts oxygenation and metabolic performance,Brightens your skin to produce a glow. This moisturizer absorbs quickly with deep level hydration!! It diminishes the appearance of age spots on your skin leaving your skin looking and  feeling young and healthy!! This moisturizer also reduces the appearance of dark circles and puffiness around your eyes!! This is amazing to have in a moisturizer and highly beneficial to your skin!! This moisturizer is definitely my new favorite moisturizer and I definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
    <li> product arrived on time as promised with no shipping or quality issues. Cream is rich and luxurious - non greasy and absorbs quickly. So far it seems to be evening out my skin tone nicely and easing some of the lines around my eyes nicely....so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And - an update. This is a great product! Over the last 3 weeks of use, my skin had become much brighter, clearer and radiant. Tiny fine lines seem to be smoothing out and vanishing. Love this product!</li>
    <li> this does work ok i would buy again i love that it does not leave my skin feeling all weird and i use it at night so far so good thank you for a fast delivery and great transaction would def give this more then 5 stars....i received this product with a coupon code thank you</li>
    <li> Works well..will continue to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical but this is a great cream.  Leaves my almost 70 yr skin feeling smooth and soft.  Have just started using it but it seems to be a winner. No dramatic effect on wrinkles yet but will give it some time.  I don&#x27;t really expect any cream can take wrinkles away anyway!  So far works great</li>
    <li> Same comments as Vernal Hyaluronic acid lotion.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet, but I don&#x27;t want to start getting them either - so I thought it was about time I tried an anti-aging line. The cream smells great, has a great consistency (not too heavy, but not so light that it absorbs leaving skin wanting for moisture). I&#x27;ve mainly used it at night after washing my face, and it has kept my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritations - it does help with combination skin.</li>
    <li> Like the smell, very light and minty.  Too soon to tell about results.  Only had it a week.  Will update in a month.</li>
    <li> Although I am not that old, my skin is still oily/combination. I was convinced I needed to use only oil-free moisturisers. I did not expect to love this product at all and I was on the fence at first. But it is very light, totally non-greasy with a light and pleasant fragrance. I highly recommend to others who are dealing with combination or oily skin at my age. No product works miracles but so far this makes my skin look and feel better.</li>
    <li> I had been using this cream for several months and really like the results when I saw an advertisement for Isomers neck firming cream and thought I would try it to see if it did as it claimed.  When it arrived I still had about a quarter amount left of the Vernal Cream, so I used it in combination with the Isomers.  However, once I ran out of the Vernal Cream, I started using the Isomers alone.  I used the Isomers on my face and neck and I couldn&#x27;t believe it, within a matter of just a few days, my skin tone changed and I noticed my skin was losing a lot of firmness.  I started looking older overall.  I&#x27;m 62 but I don&#x27;t want to look like I&#x27;m 62.  Do not waste your time with Isomers, unless you just want to use it as an expensive hand cream.  I have stopped using the Isomers all together, went back to the Vernal and noticed immediately a huge difference in my face.  I have a much better skin tone and my skin has firmed up again.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS CREAM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using the Vernal Anti-Aging Cream and still loving it.  I&#x27;ve not found anything else, that does what this cream does, better.  I now have it on subscription, so I get it once a month automatically.  It gives me a lower price and I&#x27;m still getting free shipping.  If your interested in this cream, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought that I was getting a Boots product. This one is not as good as other ones. Its too dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m older and my skin is dry. This is the first cream, and I&#x27;ve tried many, that truly works. My dry patches are gone and my skin looks smoother. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This product actually works!  I&#x27;ll never look 30 again but it has made my senior citizen skin look and feel years younger than I am.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for less than month.  I can really tell a difference in my skin.  It was kinda pricey, but well worth every penny.  I just wish it came in a larger bottle, have to just use a tiny bit to make it last a full month.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product I have ever used. Second product I have purchased from this brand. When I originally purchased it, I thought, &amp;#34;how can something so light moisturize my skin&amp;#34;? I was amazed at how many compliments I immediately started to get within a week of usage. Great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am pretty picky when it comes to moisturizers. This one feels and smells great when you put it on. Feels like a hug on your face. I used to get pretty dry on my cheeks - little rough patches. Since I have used this - I am not nearly as dry as I used to be!</li>
    <li> Not that good. I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the serum. This moisturizer is extremely light but goes on super smooth. Love the silky texture. People ask about my skin care routine all the time! I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference since I started</li>
    <li> Seems to be working, but there is only so much that can be done.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant on the price at first but decided to take the plunge….and I am glad I did! This has become my new go to moisturizer. I tell all my friends to try it. The product is so rich in quality that you only need a small amount. Due to this I am on my second month with my first bottle. My skin looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> Not enough to last a month,so it is kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> Second product I&#x27;ve purchased from this skin care line. This is something that you can use &amp; see long term effects. I have been using this cream for 6 months &amp; I love it for my neck, chest &amp; hands. Very moisturizing. This product is soft and feels good on my skin. It plumps and lifts the eye area without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t think I will order it again while is so many other products to try and I didn&#x27;t see anything too impressive after going through 2 bottles..</li>
    <li> It has a nice minty scent and seems to feel cool when I put it on.  But that&#x27;s it.  No improvement.  I&#x27;d rather keep using the Oil of Olay product I was using before.</li>
    <li> I am usually SUPER PICKY when it comes to good moisturizers for dry skin. I have to say that VERNAL is perfect for my skin. You need a tiny, tiny amount - as the cream is quite thick, a small amount will cover the whole face. It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and hydrated- AND the skin tone appears even. I have been using this along with my Bobbi Brown tinted moisturizer and together they are the best combo. If I had the money, I&#x27;d buy this and use it all over my entire body!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and prior to that I tried just about every moisturizer on the market. I will never use anything else, this is great for day and night, can use right before putting any other skin treatment on with no issues of it being oily. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over a week now and I can definitely see a difference.  My skin is clearer, dark spots from previous acne scars around chin area have diminished and my skin looks even toned on my cheeks.  Main reason for the purchase is to tighten saggy jowls (I&#x27;m late 40s) and its working!  I also use a little bit under my chin and top of neck area.  My skin is fairly sensitive so I&#x27;m using only this product as moisturizer both morning and night after cleansing with gentle soap.  My skin doesn&#x27;t itch or tingle after application so I can tell that I&#x27;m not allergic to it.  The peppermint scent is nice, too.  At the rate I&#x27;m using it, looks like the bottle would last a month.  I&#x27;ve tried pricier department store anti-aging creams that doesn&#x27;t work as well as this one in such a short time.  Vernal&#x27;s is a keeper and definitely worth it.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed! At all!! Didn&#x27;t last long either! I didn&#x27;t use much at a time...not worth the money! No results, to expensive for the amount!</li>
    <li> works with the retinol night cream very well see that review</li>
    <li> My skin looks phenomenal--I notice a significant difference after one week of usage. I&#x27;m amazed!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 6 months and absolutely love it. I have noticed a vast improvement on how my skin looks on my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;The elasticity and the texture has shown a noticeable improvement. It does not leave a heavy greasy feel to my skin.  I love the light weight feel of this moisturizer to my skin.  I will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Did not go on smooth and it gave me a major breakout.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product - I&#x27;d never heard of it and all the Amazon.com reviews were super-positive.  But those reviews made me want to try it.  Three months on, perhaps it&#x27;s my imagination, but my skin certainly feels really good, and I believe it looks better - and my fine lines seem to recede - when I wear this. I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
    <li> I have a very hard time finding a face moisturizer that isn&#x27;t oily, but works on my dry skin. This one does the trick!! As I get older my skin has become dryer and more sensitive. This product have really helped me - my skin isn&#x27;t dry anymore nor does it break out as it did from other products. I have already recommended it to two of my friends!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Actually works on my brow lines....will definitely keep in my daily routine!</li>
    <li> I got to try a sample of this awhile back and I was hooked...very luxurious &amp; light yet very moisturizing. You only need a small amount and the skin really look amazing after about two weeks now. I use at night and a lesser costing product prior to make-up AM. Request a sample if your on the fence but in my opinion this moisturizer is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Moisturizes yet is smoothing out my skin. I have just started using it so we will see how it works. It does feel like silk</li>
    <li> Been using this for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed anything different. I won&#x27;t be buying this again, a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim..and SO glad I did! This serum really does work, made my skin glow and even toned in less than 2 weeks. Yes it is pricey, but it&#x27;s very light and watery so you only need one pump to cover your face AND neck.</li>
    <li> My second bottle!  Very light, very nice fragrance.  Made a big difference in my skin after a few weeks...gave it a nice &#x27;glow&#x27; and has softened my wrinkles...will continue to buy,.</li>
    <li> As a 43 years young female, I have sensitive/ oily skin that is also mature and have issues with most facial creams that I try. This cream makes my skin look radiant and hydrated all day without the usual afternoon oily shine and has not caused a single breakout. Even though this cream is a little pricier than I am used to buying, you don&#x27;t need much and the tube is huge. I know some of you asked but in my experience it lasted over a month. I doubt I will find another facial cream I like as well as this one anytime soon. Request a sample and try this stuff, you will love it.</li>
    <li> For the first time I feel that I can see a difference from an anti aging product.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 10 days but my complexion does seem brighter and I look less tired.  I definitely am going to stick with this one for a while.</li>
    <li> I just received this a few days ago so I have only been using it a short time but so far I&#x27;m very pleased with this moisturizer cream.  It goes on very smooth and absorbs very quickly.  There is no greasiness at all and I can apply my makeup almost immediately.  Only time will tell if it actually diminishes the look of fine lines and wrinkles but I&#x27;m hopeful for some good results!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I can tell my skin has improved even in the short time i have been using it. Definitely happy with this face cream. It&#x27;s lightweight and it smells minty and seems to be great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this produce, goes on great, feels great on, BUT, pricey for the produce you receive.  Won&#x27;t last long and over the course of a year would definitely put a kink in your pocketbook.  But do love this product!  Just wish someone would understand how much more they could sell if the price were more affordable.</li>
    <li> I know it says warm between your finger tips but i have found it best to just apply it directly and warm it on your face, that way you&#x27;ll save more product.</li>
    <li> I was able to test this cream as a free option. The package is very appealing. Very easy to used. As provided by the instructions I used it in face and neck. It&#x27;s a little sticky but as it dry it&#x27;s feel good and none sticky at all. After 1 week I was able to see the difference. Excellent performance for the price.</li>
    <li> Like it so far. Sometimes it&#x27;s a bit difficult to pump the cream out.</li>
    <li> I am in my seventies. I have always had good skin, but lately, it has been sagging a bit, especially under my cheek bones. when I use Vernal Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream, it not only moisturizes, but lifts and tightens the skin. I am very happy  to have found this product.</li>
    <li> I am using this creams, but I have not seen any difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> My skin felt so soft after using this product. No break outs, no rashes, nothing happened except smooth facial skin and it even helped brighten it. I love this product. I use it everyday for my skins dryness.  Excellent product. fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I liked it but it is a bit small. For about 42 dollers it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it,but I got a discount so it was a bit better. I used this on my face and at first it didn&#x27;t feel good,but the next day my face was soft. I like it,but wouldn&#x27;t but it again.</li>
    <li> Okay I have waited a month to send in this review just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining the great qualities of this new(to me) face cream!For the first time in years I have finally found a moisturizer that immediately works to hide lines and noticeably soften wrinkles.I also have skin that tends to breakout and Vernal does not bother my skin at all,as a matter of fact I have not had ANY outbreaks at all. My family Doctor even commented.&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to gush but this really is the first time since I started the aging process that a cream really made such a difference. Did&#x27;nt mean to be so long-winded but as you probably guessed this product is worth trying my friends!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this about a week ago.  Using it everyday. Love it.  Not too creamy. Perfect consistency. A tiny bit tingly which I like and has matrixol which is supposed to be a powerful moisturizer. I would order again</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I experienced noticeable improvement in under eye wrinkles. Will continue ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased online and have used for seven days. This cream is powerful for removing fine lines of the neck, chest, and hands. Skin is soft without feeling oily. Can see a difference already. Used after cleansing in A.M and P.M. Super product.</li>
    <li> I have dry, very sensitive skin and have allergic reactions to a lot of skin care products. This one moisturizes the skin without being too greasy and still lasts all day in a very dry climate. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past four months without any adverse reactions. I also tried another product from a different company with the exact same ingredients, but the Vernal cream did a much better job of moisturizing and lasted longer everyday. This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried, including many other more expensive products. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have only worn the Vernal Anti-Aging Moisturized Cream for a few days, since I have just received it .  I will give a update after I have been out with friends for lunch in the coming week.  The cream goes on smooth and easy,doesn&#x27;t seem to dry the skin out. I also thought the price was not outrageous. That&#x27;s one of the reasons I ordered this product it should replace 3 products I was using.</li>
    <li> OK - I know that everyone skin&#x27;s different but this is seriously the most effective product I have ever tried! I have combination skin and acne scars. I&#x27;m only 27 but I already had wrinkles on my forehead. After using this product, my wrinkles disappeared, dark spots vanished, my skin brightened, and has been clearer than ever! I apply this after cleansing my face both AM &amp; PM, then apply moisturizer after. If you are concerned about the price, know that a little goes a long way! Definitely worth it. I love Vernal! I just ordered their moisturizer again and cant wait to try it.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific face cream. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and I saw results. My skin is definitely smoother when I use is once a day. I liked it so much that I tried using it twice a day, but the cream is so strong that my skin got sensitive. Once a day is best for me</li>
    <li> Great feel, better than a  serum, but too early to see results yet.</li>
    <li> As a 43 year old woman, my skin can be very temperamental. Oily in some areas of the face, dry in others, sometimes sensitive. Overall I felt I felt I need age-defying care - Well you can see my frustration in trying to find something to fight the signs of aging, Well for me this product is simply heavenly! It not only hydrate very well, but it doesn&#x27;t break me out as I read from others experiences. When I first used it, I wondered if I would wake up to breakouts...but instead I woke up to the most beautiful skin ever! As far as the anti-wrinkle claim goes, I would say that it does work. The slight lines that were forming around my eyes have diminished and are less noticeable than before. Best of all, a little goes a long way...wonderful price, wonderful product....I am sold and will be only using this night cream from now on! I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This cream has taken place of three expensive products by other manufacturers in my daily routine. I have noticed a firming and smoothing effect around the mouth. It absorbs well and has a very light, pleasant fragrance. I definitely plan on continuing to use it for a few months to see if some of the benefits mentioned by others happen for me. I rarely see any difference when I try a new product, no matter how others rave about it. This product is an exception- I really do think it has made a difference.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  This is my second bottle.  Makes my skin soft and I can definitely tell a difference.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to review this product before I started noticing changes in my face, after 2 weeks of using it everyday I can say I noticed the smile lines on the side of my lips are diminishing already, I am happy for the changes that I can see. I hope my testimony help to new buyers.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It makes my face instantly softer, yet somehow the few wrinkles I have on my face are disappearing, or minimizing.  It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I have used in a long while, and it&#x27;s not that expensive!  I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using religiously for a little over 2 weeks now. I noticed the smile lines around my mouth were almost gone within a couple days! The crows feet are fading but still there. Even the uneven spots on my face seem to be more blended and soft. My package arrived in a timely  manner and I plan to continue using this product even at full price ( I purchased this on sale for 50% off)</li>
    <li> It has only been  10 days but I see a big difference in jowl lines and overall facial radiance!  I am 47 years old and have tried several different&lt;br /&gt;products over the years and this is the first one that I can say really does work.  I already ordered my 2nd bottle to ensure there is no time lapse once the first is done!  I also ordered the dark spot reducer.  I will be glad to post an update once I receive and have the chance to try it.  I have a very large sunspot under right eye and this is my last attempt to lighten before seeking out a dermatologist.  I will keep you posted!</li>
    <li> Maybe I expected more than I got.  Rea!ly didn&#x27;t see a lot of results.  Kinda disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week, and I admit that I am surprised at the results in such a short time.  I have mature skin and the issues that come with this, and I am very pleased with how my skin looks since staring with Vernal.  My skin is &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; and soft, with wrinkles much less visible.  My skin appears to be that of a younger woman.  It also feels smoother and softer...I am very pleased with this product.  I also purchased the Vernal product for &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; (N.E. Spot Protector) and after a week I can already see these areas fading.  I have tried many products, many far more expensive  through the years, and have been very conscientious with skin care all my life.  These Vernal products, without a doubt, are the best that I have used. I am very pleased. and will do another review in a month to report on them.  I highly recommend them.  NOTE...The products &amp;#34;go a long way&amp;#34; and the size of the product for the money spent is very generous.</li>
    <li> I received this lotion unsure what to expect as I have bought a ton of facial lotions on the market only to be unhappy. I have very dry skin in places and very oily skin in other places. I am VERY happy with the results of this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my face or clog up pores. I have always tried to care of my skin and am willing to pay the cost of this lotion for the results I have received. I found that a little bit goes a long ways so although a small bottle it will last awhile. I will update my review regarding the wrinkles and aging portion of the lotion. I&#x27;m watching for the results but trust I will see them.</li>
    <li> Tried it,  expecting  some change.  Didn&#x27;t work for me,  hopefully it will work for you</li>
    <li> I have been using this almost a month and while it does leave my skin looking and feeling good I think it is definitely over priced. I use the Aveeno Positively Radiant Cleanser and Moisturizer and I personally think they do just as good of a job as this product for half the price. I am in my 30&#x27;s so maybe if I had deeper lines and creases I would have noticed a bigger difference.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. My skin is firmer, tighter and less wrinkles. I will definitely buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this product - I have very sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb some types of moisturizers, but this one goes on easily and seems to penetrate my skin rather than sitting on top of it. Regarding skin sensitivity, I have been using the Vernal anti-aging moisturizing cream twice a day for one week and it definitely hasn&#x27;t caused any reactions, redness, bumps, etc. I  haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to comment on some of the longer term benefits (elimination of fine lines and wrinkles, reduction of dark circles and puffiness around eyes) but I do feel like my skin is a little more supple and quite possibly brighter and lighter. I also like that this product is multi-functional ... if I have to use a different product for everything, I will forget one or the other and won&#x27;t remember which one goes first and which one goes last. I travel frequently, and this is also a great TSA friendly product - I will definitely be bringing it on my next trip and leaving home the other moisturizers, eye cream, dark spot treatment, etc. It&#x27;s a little pricey for a small amount, so I am hoping to see further improvements - and, a little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> Throughout the harsh winter I started moisturizing my face. This product was just what I needed at the end of a long day with bitter temperatures. The cream is thick enough to work overnight and replenish with a subtle glow that is typically absent during cold season.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is one of my favorite products. I have a problem with a few wrinkles, and my skin is naturally succumbing to gravity.  For the price, this product is definitely worth using.  Plus, it contains natural ingredients that our skin needs!  I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product is heaven sent. It’s a life savior. Truly, it has revitalized my skin. I have a more youthful glow since using it and my skin looks refreshed. It hydrates really well and it feels like it absorbs fully into the skin. After years of trying different anti-aging moisturizers, I would have to say that this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this moisturizer cream.  I would definitely buy it again.  I especially love that on the directions for use, it tells you the best way to use it instead of just &amp;#34;apply to face&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this moisturizer to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> This cream is super lightweight, perfect for night or day time wear. I use it as my night cream but sometimes when I&#x27;m feeling dry, I&#x27;ll apply it as needed. Great cream.</li>
    <li> I was a loyal Pro-X Deep Set Wrinkle Repair Crème user for years and saw great results before trying Vernal. Although Vernal seems to have all the right stuff in it, I&#x27;m not sure I see any improvement and in fact I actually notice more fine lines around my eyes. And really, where&#x27;s the sunscreen Vernal??  If this anti aging crème is for daytime, the sunscreen is a must have ingredient. If I hadn&#x27;t used Pro-X for so long I would probably keep using Vernal, but when this runs out I will switch back.  EDIT: Changed my mind about switching back to Pro-X and I&#x27;m on my third bottle now and am going to stick with it.  I am loving this.  I still wish it had a sunscreen, but I do like the ingredients and the results I am seeing and I love how this feels.</li>
    <li> I think this is a hit or miss face cream depending on everybody&#x27;s skin. I used to wear it only every now and then and didnt see any results. As of lately I decided to routinely apply it every morning and every night for the past 2-3 weeks and I do notice a better even tone. It is not a miracle product but it does pretty good to what it states. Would probably buy again. :)\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Have seen a noticeable difference! Great product!</li>
    <li> An odorless and refreshing creamy lotion that obsorbs immediately into your skin.  I am very satisfied with the results of decreasing the depth of my facial stress lines.  I have already made recommendations to friends.</li>
    <li> Turned my face bright red.  I have pale skin but have used creams such as Vivite with no ill effects, so I sent this one back.  Probably needs some reviews by a range of dermatologists.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just okay, nothing to get excited about. almost feels like a peel off mask at first but it softens up after several minutes. probably won&#x27;t purchase again because of the price.</li>
    <li> Great cream, so far it feels like its helping with my dry skin, however base on the bottle I will run out cream before I can see some results</li>
    <li> I bought the Serum and Anti aging cream for the first time about a months ago.It feels good on my face,I cant tell you that I did not noticed any difference in my face,but I will stay with this product for some time.</li>
    <li> Been using twice daily since November.I don&#x27;t see any difference, however, I must admit my wife mentioned&lt;br /&gt;unsolicitedly, &amp;#34;you look better since using that stuff&amp;#34; Since she said so I keep using. The verdict is still out for me.</li>
    <li> Love the minty smell and it sinks right in so you don&#x27;t have a long wait to apply makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I have noticed an improvement on fine lines. I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in under chin but will continue using product for lines around the mouth area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in in my late 30&#x27;s.  I bought in hopes of giving my face a fresher look.  Since I&#x27;ve been using the product my skin has completely changed.  I didn&#x27;t really break out a lot, but I would every now and then.  I have not broken out once since using.  I will buy and buy again.  I love this lotion!!!!</li>
    <li> After using Vernal for less than one week, i can feel and see a difference in my 64 year old skin. If you don&#x27;t believe it, try it. I have nothing to gain by lying to you. I have tried many many items on the market, this is by far the best. Hope you will love it a much as i do.[[ASIN:B00CJ01QT8 Vernal Anti-aging Moisturizer, All in One with Tetrapeptide &amp; Vitamin C, Anti-wrinkle, Instant-lift Solution]]</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for me....total waste of money.</li>
    <li> It works wonders! Fine lines disappear!</li>
    <li> I live in a sunny climate and I love to swim so my skin needs all the help it can get.  When I was offered this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to accept.  The moisturizer cream comes in an easy to use pump bottle and it does not feel greasy at all on the skin.  One of my biggest problems with these kinds of products is that my skin tends to be on the oily side and moisturizer make it into an oil slick.  But the Vernal anti-aging moisturizer cream does not have that affect.  I use it every night before bed and I wake up with soft skin.  Do I look 10 years younger?  All I can say is that no one believes me when I tell them my 60th birthday is right around the corner -- and by right around the corner I mean in 3 months.  I am generally skeptical about these kinds of products so I will post a photo here, continue to use the product, and post an updated photo every couple of weeks or so, and let you decide.    * First photo added 7/28/15   * Updated photo added 8/10/15   * Updated photo added 11/18/15</li>
    <li> gives nice moisture to skin.  too early to tell if my skin is less dry or with less wrinkles on face</li>
    <li> Excited! Honest review coming soon</li>
    <li> I am happy with Vernal Anti Aging Moisturizer. It is lightweight and has a nice texture and feel. It is readily absorbed by the skin. I love the witch hazel extract component, it has a nice tingly feeling with application. I am using it daily and feel it is a great moisturizer to use prior to make-up application. It definitely boasts a nice ingredient profile with components including shea butter, peptides, and vitamin E to name a few. I did a receive a discount for this product by writing this review, but has not changed my opinion of this product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with Vernal. I actually saw positive results that my friends noticed. I definitely noticed a firming effect. At nearly 61 years of age, I don&#x27;t expect wrinkles to vanish but they do not seem as deep and this product certainly gives you a glow. Followed directions exactly. While it is a pleasant cream I did not experience any acne, although at my age did not expect to</li>
    <li> very nice product beautiful texture hydrating and improves the appearance of pores and tightens the skin I will recommend to others</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion A LOT ...it is too small though. They need to double the amount of product you get.</li>
    <li> good product.  goes on smooth and I&#x27;ve noticed some great changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion along with the serum and have been pleased with both after just one week. The lotion, like the serum, get soaked up quickly so I need to use more than I thought I would. The lotion has an invigorating smell and feel to it as it is being applied. The smell goes away quickly and my skin is left very smooth. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks after several weeks of these products</li>
    <li> I try a lot of products, and am often disappointed.  But, ended up quite liking this and will buy it again.  I like the slightly minty fragrance, the light yet rich texture, and the overall appearance and feel of my skin immediately after applying and throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product works or not.  The pump did not work and although it was sealed it did not appear full.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t necessary noticed any improvement on my skin luminescence or wrinkles... besides that it&#x27;s an okay moisturizer,  no adverse reactions , not leaving your skin oily either but planning to invest more and go with something that gives results like hydropeptide or so.</li>
    <li> Will take time to see the outcome, but have not had any side effects, I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a repurchase of this product.  I like it very much.  I feel it has smoothed my skin and lessened the wrinkling.  I&#x27;m 72 and take good care of my skin, and this product helps.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> havent noticed a big difference but dries on great</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ll never know!  I mean, this product took 10 years off my appearance, and I always get awesome compliments on how young I look.  I have a 20 year high school reunion coming up, and I am so excited to see everyone from my past.  With this product, I haven&#x27;t aged a day!</li>
    <li> Love this product and it works miracles</li>
    <li> Vernal worked really well for me. I received it as a gift from a friend and didn&#x27;t really expect any results because I rarely notice a difference with these types of creams. I am in my mid-twenties with very fair skin and I have some acne scars from adult acne that are noticeably lighter. After just  10  days of using this cream (only once per day at night before I go to bed), the results are very visible. I had a guy friend ask me if I had done something different to my face because I GLOWING. He said whatever i was doing was working and to not stop because he&#x27;d never seen my skin look like that before. I didn&#x27;t even think about it until later that I had just started using this cream.</li>
    <li> My sister has this and is super excited to have it and LOVES IT!!! i cant wait until mine comes in!</li>
    <li> I made a mistake by choosing this expensive product; it did none of the descriptions on the product.  I actually am worried that I may have damaged my skin by unknowingly trusting this product.</li>
    <li> This product actually does what it claims to do, particularly for fine lines.  I definitely plan to order again.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great product and one I will probably buy again!  However, it definitely takes more than one application for even the face alone.  It takes me 2-3 but it is winter and I do have a dry, air-duct heated house.  And I&#x27;m no spring chicken ;). I would have given it five stars, but considering how quickly I&#x27;m going through it I think it&#x27;s going to be pricier than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is now my go-to for winter (please don&#x27;t discontinue it!). I highly recommend giving it a try if your skin is anything like mine. Absorbs quickly and does not clog my pores. This is all I need in the morning after cleansing my face, it restores moisture and protect my skin with antioxidants.</li>
    <li> Other anti-aging products I&#x27;ve tried either sting, cause me to break out, or smell awful. This product actually diminish the few wrinkles I had, smells lovely, and never stung at all--you can even use it around the eye area! I received a free sample to try, and after just 4 days my skin was softer (and clearer), and the stress wrinkles around my forehead were less apparent. I just love the way it makes my skin feel. I&#x27;ve never found anything like it!</li>
    <li> I have read in several journals that the secret anti aging cure is Matrixyl...So I did a search and found this...I really love this- it has no scent- so refreshing so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Can&#x27;t tell if I see a difference yet, but I feel like I do...At least no new wrinkles are coming;)</li>
    <li> I am 39 years old with relatively large pores and combination oily skin. I switched to Vernal Moisturizer from Lifecell Skincare. I have creams that have cost well over $100 and this one beats them all. This moisturizer goes on light on the skin and in the few weeks I&#x27;ve used this I have seen a huge improvement in fighting wrinkles. The product also evens and corrects skin tone and plumps the skin to give a more youthful look. I sometimes get bored and go back to high end more expensive creams, then I notice they are not as effective as this line. I will always use Vernal now. I am 39 but my skin looks like it&#x27;s 31. Love, love, love, Vernal Moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I am in the process of reordering Vernal’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Anti-Aging Moisturizer.  I began using the products on March 7 and notice a significant difference in my 51 year old complexion. My skin feels tighter and wrinkles are diminishing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily and so far, have not noticed any difference between this one any other moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product to review for free. I recieved the item today and immediately wanted to try it so i washed off my makeup and put this product on. It smelled ok. It wasnt too thick and not runny. When i applied it to my face it burned. I had to wash my face immediately for it to stop burning. This product is not for me.</li>
    <li> I think some humans can tolerate this, but I cannot. I am sending it back for a refund. Unless they carry Retinol products, which I thought the product was. Also not a good moisturizer. Though skin is itchy, I feel no moisturizing effect. Maybe it&#x27;s just me! I wonder how to return it as we burned the original box in our fireplace for heat before the 100 degree days we are having and, of course, our fires.</li>
    <li> I discontinued using it. Maybe I did not give it enough time. It looked like it was drying my skin and opening my pores.  I just use vitamin E on my face and a sunscreen when I go walking on a sunny day.</li>
    <li> While I am still trying out this cream, so far it seems to reduce the fine lines around my eyes and does not leave my skin with a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Great on aging skin, gentle enough to use everyday!  My skin has improved significantly.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this cream, it&#x27;s also skin friendly. Time will tell about results.</li>
    <li> This product has put my other skin care to SHAME at a fraction of the cost! Have been using this for less than a month and I can already see a difference. Very hydrating and sinks in quickly. No stinky fragrance, it feels elegant and does well at evening up my complexion. I have also seen a definite improvement to wrinkles on the thin skin of my chest and forehead. This is a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this out based on all the great reviews and I definitely wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has its glow back and it helps hydrate your skin and the texture is a bit different but that&#x27;s what I like about it. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and I keep mine in the fridge so it feels cool when I put it on. Over time I started to notice that the texture of my skin began to even out and some problem spots became less pronounced. I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles but I have noticed some improvement on my fine lines. Very happy with this find and I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Almost coming up to 3 1/2 weeks of use, every time using it feels really good.  Skin is firming up, and while wrinkles aren&#x27;t nearly as less as I hoped, several people at work have complimented me on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t decide on one of the more expensive wrinkle creams.  This Vernal cream works just as well, IMO.  If they change their formula, I might have to look for a different cream.  But until then, this one&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> This product came recommended from a good friend who bought the cream last year. I have combination skin and all creams I have found previously made my skin dry within hours. This keeps my skin hydrated for longer than 24 hours to where I forget sometimes I need it. I have also noticed It balances and evens my skin tone. Only giving it four stars because of the price, but honestly, it&#x27;s worth it and it lasts a really long time since you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
    <li> Okay, it&#x27;s only been a few days but I swear I can already see a difference.  I was BORN with scowl marks, and believe it or not, they seem to be less severe already.  Love the smell, the feel, the way my face looks.  I hate makeup, or perfume, or anything but organic African Shea butter or coconut oil on my body.  I use it right after my shower daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing (so far).  You don&#x27;t need much of it.  It spreads very easily and evenly.  Looking forward to what another couple weeks does.  I&#x27;ll update in another couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/8:  My co-workers are now making comments about how amazing my skin looks. They&#x27;re asking me what I&#x27;m doing differently.  I use it once a day in the morning and only a tiny pea size and I STILL can&#x27;t believe how radiant my skin is now.  The dry psoriasis patches above my eyebrows are gone, and some chronic scaly areas are also gone...my scowl marks are MINIMAL now!!  and without BOTOX!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer.  Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell any difference since I have been using it. Maybe I didn&#x27;t need it to start with.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product and all so gave it to my daughter and we are both enjoying the wonderful effects on our skins.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product. My husband had purchased a very expensive line of face care products for me about a year ago. After I looked those up online and saw how much he had paid I nearly fainted! So, I was in pursuit of finding a good moisturizer to help with face wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I am 62, and this product appears to be doing a good job. I know I can&#x27;t be rid of wrinkles entirely, but this product seems to iron them out fine enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;I lightly moisten my face just before putting on this lotion. It seems to help seal in the moisture. I have used about one third of it so far, but believe I will re-order.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer on a daily basis . I like that it moisturizes my face and neck well. As far as making me look younger, it hasn&#x27;t happened yet, but I&#x27;ve only been using the cream for a two weeks. I like that is not greasy when you first put it on and after a few minutes it absorbs into your skin and makes the skin feel soft and hydrated. This is a good moisturizer that is easy to carry in your purse.</li>
    <li> I really liked this moisturizer since the first week I started using it, but now I LOVE IT! After continued use, for about 2 months now, my skin is simply very much improved! Smooth, soft and dare I say...radiant! I also saw line reduction and some wrinkles around my face fade away after a while. The overall healthy quality of my skin makes my face look equally young, so I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference as far as wrinkles but it has helprf my dry skin. I was not able to find anything to help my dry skin until vernal. Maybe I will try the eye cream to see if it works better for wrinkles</li>
    <li> This is a great product&amp;#62;  I do notice a definite difference in my skin.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews...but this cream is extraordinary and I cannot live without it!  Not only does it take care of wrinkles but it totally did away with a pesky rash area on my face that nothing else could cure-not even my dermatologist!</li>
    <li> This product is a wonderful product. By that I mean, it has delivered everything I hope it would. My skin is highly nourished from using this product and over the course of a month it seems as if my fine lines are slowly but surely fading. I feel as if my skin has a more youthful appearance than before where when I looked in the mirror my skin appeared rather dull and lifeless. I highly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but not as effective as the Hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion that adds a firming touch to aging face!</li>
    <li> This is a nice smoothing serum for your face. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue behind and it dries,absorbs fairly quick. I have not encountered any issues with it going against wearing make up. It absorbs quickly so no interfering with foundation. I also have not encountered my pores getting clogged from this. You dont need to waste this but using a large amount each time, a small dab goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I have for the past week been having dryness around my temples and those small fine dryness lines, they have reduced a great amount. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I got a discount on this item for my own honest feed back, the above is my own feed back from my own use and purchase.</li>
    <li> My beautiful wife applied this product and as the years disappeared, the frequency of sex became so often that I barely had time to rest between bouts. Once she hit 18.......oh my, as a 48 year old, it was like.....well I cannot say anymore. Buy it, and you will not be disappointed. I will order more of this to send my friends as a care package to hopefully improve their love life.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I was concerned when I first applied the moisturizer as it seemed a bit sticky at first and than dries smoothy. It really tones and feels like it is tightening your skin. I use it twice daily and am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for close to four weeks now and my skin is looking good. Frankly it hasn&#x27;t look this good in a long time. Dramatic difference in skin tone! My skin is thin and dry and this cream made me look like I had a skin resurfacing. Plumped up my skin and made it look dewy. It&#x27;s light and not greasy. It absorbs well and my skin feels so soft and smooth. I&#x27;m addicted. This cream makes me look years younger.</li>
    <li> After one week of usage, I see a positive difference in skin texture with less noticeable lines.  I am almost 65 and so far, I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Started usingt this product and not only did I notice but other people noticed.  I have had acne break outs as an adult, never had them as a teenager.  This somehow has decreased my breakouts.  especially the hormonal ones around my jaw line.  My pores are smaller and just an overall smoother skin look and tone.  Everyone is different. What has worked great on others didnt work on me.  I am fair skin, occasional tanner and smoker.  I am 35 years old live in a warm very dry climate.  Diet is pretty much on point as well as regular exercise.  hope this helps out with your choice.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in less that a week,my skin was more supple and the texture was luminous. This product makes your skin smoother and softer and at the end of your day you make up still looks amazing. Can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin feels, and I agree with the other reviewer who said her makeup looks great. My makeup actually looks more natural and fresh all day. I didn&#x27;t know my skin could be like this, and I can&#x27;t stop touching it. Needless to say, I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2-3 weeks morning and night. I have seen no difference in my fine lines, pores, complexion or anything else. I will continue to use only simply because I don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely great moisturizer! I have been using this product for about 4 months and I love, love, love it! People have been telling me I look years younger. I need less foundation and my skin is more supple. When I started using this I had deep forehead lines and creases. Now they are significantly reduced. I also have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate.</li>
    <li> It did nothing...I&#x27;ve been using it daily for some time. Definitely will not reorder this item.</li>
    <li> A true scientific breakthrough in the field of micro biology engineering of algae oils. The wizards at Solazyme are perfecting pure unadulterated oils....</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, not a lot needed, so, goes a long way on usage, but, haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes yet</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT AND DID NOT SEE ANY RESULTS OR DIFFERENCE ON MY FACE! NOT ONLY THAT YOU ONLY RECEIVE A HALF FULL BOTTLE THAT DID NOT LAST ME ANY TIME. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE AMOUNT IN THE BOTTLE! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!</li>
    <li> Well I only ordered this because of the advertisement about Ellen using this; The bottle will not pump as I have to open it daily so I think it would have been nice if it worked for the money.  It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and really I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> Through out the years I have used &amp; tried several dozens of anti aging creams, moisturizers and serums on the market. For me none have come relatively close to the immediate results I have had Vernal. Living in Canada, harsh cold winter weather dries my skin really badly. I&#x27;ve got combination skin too so finding good skin care is hard. Like the other posts, a little goes a long way. My skin has turned around with this product and is more hydrated. no breakouts even in the oilier areas. it is a bit silky texture-wise, but I use it only at night. It is also not heavily scented so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this product.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any better than any other less expensive cream I&#x27;ve used but it&#x27;s almost impossible to get out of the container.  The pump is not very good.  I&#x27;ve stored it upside down, shaken it, etc. but very little comes out.  Maybe it will last longer.</li>
    <li> It takes more than a dot of this on your finder to moisturize your face.  I used 1 dot for each quadrant.  It does not leave your skin feeling greasy but couldn&#x27;t see any great difference between this product and my other daily moisturizers that I spend way less money on.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product,  I&#x27;m sorry I did.  I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin after using it for nearly a month.</li>
    <li> After reading a magazine&#x27;s article on mytrixil products and how they take anywhere from 6-12 weeks to make a noticeable difference in your skin, I was skeptical - BOY WAS I WRONG. I decided to buy Vernal and seriously, after 3 days my skin has NEVER looked better. It&#x27;s bright, pores shrunk and it just looked healthy and glowing.  For those complaining that it did nothing for fine lines/wrinkles - Even prescription Retin or mytrixil-A takes about 6 weeks for a noticeable difference and NO topical product will get rid of DEEP lines - that&#x27;s what Botox is for folks.</li>
    <li> I  have been using Vernal for over 2 months and just purchased another bottle, so I won&#x27;t run out. This cream isn&#x27;t magically perfect, Vernal moisturizer REALLY does work. It may take a few weeks to notice any changes and a few months to notice more dramatic changes, but you will notice a gradual fading of dark spots. Several years ago I had a few laser treatments which provided very quick results. I believe that the results fom the Vernal are just as good, one just has to be patient. I have seen sun-related age spots, as well as old acne scars and curling iron burn marks fade dramatically. I&#x27;ve reviewed this product in the pa st and will contiue to recommend it. This stuff works!!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 6 weeks.  I like it, but have not noticed a dramatic difference yet.</li>
    <li> Just one of those moisture, you use it, and forget about it, no surprise impact on me, I would not purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I am very dissapointed. I thought that it would make my face smooth and hydrated. It didn&#x27;t work for me. As soon as i applied it to my skin, it opened my pores and left my face dry. It It made my wrinckles appear worst.</li>
    <li> I probably would have given this product a 4 star review but the pump broke off right away.  Terrible packaging.  I just pour out a few drops.  Feels good on your skin.  Good moisturizer but I still use it under my regular moisturizer.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the money actually.  Loreal&#x27;s Olay Regenerest serum is just as good and cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product twice a day for over two months, and I haven&#x27;t seen any lightening of age spots.</li>
    <li> I am 66 and I have used GM Collin for years.  There were so many bottles to keep track of what to put on when and it was getting too expensive.  Got this on a whim while looking for something else, and thrilled with it!  I had to go out of town and wanted something simple for skin routine.  Just took this and didn&#x27;t pay much attention.  After a week I got more compliments on my skin than I ever had.  Two people said I was beautiful (strangers).  I am using more of it because my skin is still dry with just a pea sized drop.  Now I want to use it on my chest area.  If it changes that, I&#x27;ll buy a case.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product and I do believe I have seen visible results.  My only complaint is that it is really hard to get out of the bottle and I think there will be a lot of wasted product because of that.</li>
    <li> I have very mature skin, this works very good, not sticky&lt;br /&gt;can put makeup on within minutes after I apply.</li>
    <li> It is the best anti aging I ever used. I saw in the first day improvement in my skin. It was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I expect more after 2 months but is still the same after the first time.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my Vernal anti aging moisturizer cream, I have been using it for less than a week and already my skin is tighter and the wrinkles less noticeable. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin is going to look like in a couple of weeks. Very Very pleased.</li>
    <li> WITHIN 1 MINUTE AFTER APPLING  I SAW AN D FELT THE DIFFERENT.&lt;br /&gt;AN WONDERFUL PRODUCT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY.</li>
    <li> I use this every night after washing my face. I like how it makes your skin feel soft and smooth! It is actually quite a bit of product for the price. In general my skin looks clearer and more even toned. Have had people comment on how nice my skin looks!</li>
    <li> Amazingly this really expensive product came in a defective pump bottle.  Inside there was no tube for the product to be delivered to the pump top..  Have sent it back, never really got to use the cream so cant judge it.  Was too thick to pour out of bottle to use that way, and it would have been very wasteful.  Also bottle was NOT full when received, maybe 2/3.  Was this already sent back to company once and re -sold???  Seems like a maybe.  also a dent in the cap (metal) ... smells like mint candies, not offensive, but would interfere with personal perfumes etc.</li>
    <li> I use at morning time so my skin has the most time to absorb all the moisture this amazing product gives. I have felt the difference since day one I started using the product a week and a half ago. My skin is so soft, smooth, clear, and visibly radiant. Also, now know the meaning of supple for the first time in years! What can I say my skin is so soft and my fine lines are disappearing. Even the deeper wrinkles are smoothing out after just one tube. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Cloged my pours. Stopped using it</li>
    <li> After a week of using the cream, the facial wrinkles/fine lines are less visible and the skin looks brighter.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s, having dry skin and some anti aging concerns. First things first, this moisturizer is great, it absorbs really quickly and did not leave any oily residuals. It glides on smooth and I massage it in my skin thoroughly. The deep lines around mouth, cheeks and on my forehead appear faded, much more subtle, and my skin is softer, clearer, and plumper. The lines on my neck are softening and not as deep, also. No irritation or redness that my fair, sensitive skin usually gets with botanical creams and plant based skin products. I still can&#x27;t believe my eyes. I am amazed at how my skin responded so quickly to this cream. Will definitely purchase more of this product.</li>
    <li> I see a difference in my skin.  Skin feels tighter and looks brighter.  It is not greasy.  Will order again</li>
    <li> I am on the fence with this product. It has a nice light minty smell; sort of refreshing. However, I bought it for the anti-aging part! I don&#x27;t see any changes so far and its been several weeks.</li>
    <li> Still too soon to make the call on whether this product will keep the lines at bay.  I&#x27;m 46 with sun damage (amongst other things).  I use Acure Organics to cleanse, then I use a Vitamin C serum, followed by Acure Organics Argan oil, then the Vernal moisturizer.  I top that off with Coola sunscreen before I head out to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars because it hasn&#x27;t reacted negatively to my skin, which is a great thing because my skin is really sensitive.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smooth and absorbs into your skin leaving it nicely moisturized. I have not had the time to test for the anti-aging properties but will review again once I have had time to  notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I got 2 bottles of this and used as said on the box it didn&#x27;t do anything not even a minimal fade on my spots If is so good shouldn&#x27;t work at least a little</li>
    <li> so far love it, my skin seems brighter, not sure if it&#x27;s really helping with the wrinkles but time will tell.  The smell is a little off to me, but I like the way this is perfomign</li>
    <li> I used almost full bottle and  noticed neither bad or good changes happened to my skin. This cream just does nothing, but at least no harm. For me  it doesn&#x27;t feel like moisturizer , I guess its just how cream feels on the skin. Will I buy it again? No. There are so many other products to explore.</li>
    <li> I love this whole Vernal Skincare line. I have mature skin and am very impressed with this moisturizer as it lives us to the company&#x27;s claims. It is the first product I use morning and night. It sinks in almost immediately, leaves tight, dry skin smooth and soft with near instant results. Pretty hard to find a product with anti-aging ingredients suitable for combo skin. Love the price too I&#x27;m hooked on their scrub and will try other products. An added plus is that this wonderful moisturizer is reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I received Vernal Anti-Aging Moisturize about a week ago. Immediately I  found that it smoothed my skin and made it softer. I really like this product!</li>
    <li> almost finished the bottle and have seen zero improvement - they should allow us to do before and after pix to prove</li>
    <li> Delivery time was good and company followed up about the product with me via email, which was great.  But unfortunately, product did not do anything on my skin including skin tone, wrinkles, dark spots, enlarged pores, etc..  One thing I liked about the product was its smell.  It smells minty.</li>
    <li> So at 53 and counting I&#x27;ve become a product junkie, looking for always new anti aging products and anything to help me fight the good fight. After spending literally thousands of dollars trying to find a product that actually makes a difference I can see, Vernal has delivered! In week 3 of using Vernal I could actually see the lessening of crease lines and the H between my brows. My skin looks noticeably younger and has a healthy glow. I balked at the price but I am so glad I took the plunge. My search has ended :)</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer after applying the Vernal Hyaluronic Acid, I love the way my skin feels afterward . It feels soft moisturized and not oily .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early for a product review..but I question if I may have received a full bottle of moisturizer..the pump did not work..I pulled off the top..and see that I have less than a half bottle of product..I poured that into an extra pump bottle I had on hand..so I don&#x27;t have the original for return.</li>
    <li> I love it, You will love it. it adapts to my skin.  love it better than any cream I have ever used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, but I&#x27;ve began to use anti-aging products. It&#x27;s never too early to start! I use this product at night, and in the morning. I feel as though it&#x27;s already tightened my neck and chin area! My neck is also soft and moisturized, and noticeably healthier looking. It almost has a soft glow to it. Let&#x27;s face it, only plastic surgery is really going to lift your skin but this cream does help with firmness and improves the overall look of your skin.</li>
    <li> Nice product, makes my skin look great.</li>
    <li> My Update - Kudos to Customer Service for replying to my email sent to them.  They did this right away.  They will refund/credit/replace( one of the three), now this is great Customer Service since I was having issues over and over with my bottle working. They said it was rare but did happen some times and they were fixing it! Will update soon!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used. I have very sensitive skin and this is great. This product has kept my skin in great shape for weeks now. The moisturizer absorbs immediately, never leaves skin greasy but work to keep skin hydrated amazingly well. My enlarged pores have virtually diminished. The texture of my skin is has improved dramatically . I will never go back to another moisturizer. BTW, I use it around my eyes as well and there is no irritation whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find a product less expensive than Lifecell, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. My face felt greasy and my make up was sliding off after a couple of hours. I am back to Lifecell and happy. I am finishing the rest of the Vernal on my hands. I haven&#x27;t notice any improvement yet.</li>
    <li> Was excited to try this product at such a discounted price!  Fights wrinkles and fine lines...leaving skin soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> I gave Vernal Anti Aging Cream four out of five stars because I do not know just how much better it will be. I love the feel of it on my skin and it has helped reduce the fine lines and has a positive effect on the overall look of my skin. At my age,I do not expect miracles but I am so pleased with the improvements that I would tell every one that it is worth what I paid and more. It is about one months supply. I am very glad that I took a chance after so many trials and failures. This is the real thing.</li>
    <li> I been looking for a anti aging moisturizer that I like for a few months now. The moisturizer needs to have good ingredients, good reviews and most of all do not irritate my skin. I came across Vernal after a friend have been using it for a few months and talked about it. This moisturizer IS everything I been looking for and then some. I purchased it back in April and been using it since. It does not irritate my skin. Wrinkles and fine lines are diminishing (no illusion there) and I like the scent it has. I been using it twice a day, AM and PM and I can&#x27;t get enough of it! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> One of my pet peeves is when there is not a spritzer tube to bring up the substance in a tube/jar.  I&#x27;m not sure of the correct name for the little plastic round thing that enables the substance to be brought to the top, but my Vernal Moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have one.  It makes me wonder if that is the way this company designed the product.  There is about 9/10&#x27;s of the moisturizer left and I can&#x27;t get it out!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 2 stars because the moisturizer appears to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Within an hour of posting the above review, I was contacted by the distributor for Vernal. He explained that this moisturizer does not have a pump, but rather a mechanism that pushes the substance up and out of the nozzle.  I received a defective unit.  I was given a new jar.  I am very impressed with the customer service and recommend this product.  If you don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;m sure the company will work with you.</li>
    <li> I got this first as a sample. Around three weeks I started to see a difference immediately in the texture of my skin. Some of the very fine lines around my forehead did a 360 degree turn for the better and they continue to improve. I&#x27;m in the entertainment industry and the health/look of my skin is very important. I have had oily skin my entire life and finding products that don&#x27;t make me break out or contribute to my problematic skin are hard to find. I love this cream in the summer and winter and it smells divine!</li>
    <li> On the first day, I could see a different aspect. On the fifth day, the fine line on my forehead almost disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with that product. Arrived on time and good packaging.Thanks to AMAZON and to the seller who&lt;br /&gt;delivered what was promised,</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different anti-aging products but none have performed as well as Vernal moisturizer. I was using Vichy before I started using Vernal and liked it, but this is even better. I am in my forties and have the usual age spots and duller complexion associated with the fourth decade of life. Within days of using Vernal I noticed a lifting and firming of my skin. I am using the cream with their Hylaronic Acid Serum at night and a strong sunscreen tinted moisterizer during the day. My skin is actually glowing like it did in my thirties. When I wake up in the morning the skin around my eyes (the eyelids in particular) is more taut. It doesn&#x27;t take hours to look awake. My husband keeps commenting how nice I look and people at work are asking me if I did something different with my hair (I haven&#x27;t). Feels good to to have found a product that works for me. I highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I received the product with high hopes.  The bottle is large with very little product in it and so thick it won&#x27;t come out of the bottle.  Quite dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in less that two weeks, my skin was more supple and the texture was more firm. I can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin feels, and I agree with the other reviewer who said her makeup looks great. My makeup actually looks more natural and fresh all day. I didn&#x27;t know my skin could be like this, and I can&#x27;t stop touching it. Overall very refreshing, lightweight, absorbs quickly and soothing,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched everywhere, looked up ratings and reviews and finally settled on trying Vernal moisturizer out. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.  Prior to starting this I was using Estee Lauder products and really liked how my skin looked however, I was spending a fortune!  The first week I noticed my skin looked good but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was still from the Estee Lauder products that I had used religiously for years before.  Now, I&#x27;m about a month into using only this product and I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.  When I apply the moisturizer my skin still feels dry and tight for about an hour...not sure why but after that it usually feels good. I will probably buy this product again but, I&#x27;m still looking for something affordable that is better.</li>
    <li> I saw results immediately, but haven&#x27;t used for enough time to evaluate yet. It does make your skin look and feel better.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer.  Not best under foundation so I use it at night.  But pleased overall and would order again.</li>
    <li> Great product i love it&lt;br /&gt;its has a very good quality</li>
    <li> Best skincare cream I&#x27;ve used yet! Within the first week of trying this cream I&#x27;ve notice noticeable improvements in my skin (especially in the fine lines due to age around my face) . I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! In my opinion it is truly a bargain at $40. I&#x27;ve told all my friends about it and recommended to anyone looking for a long-term skincare treatment regimen.</li>
    <li> As one who orders skin care products on line. Th choice, one of my poorest represents wasted effort and money. It is one that taught me the dangers and pitfalls of poor investigation.</li>
    <li> This cream, which got very good Amazon reviews, came quickly, and I&#x27;ve started using it.  It goes on smoothly, has a minty scent, and comes in a pump bottle.  I&#x27;m hoping for good results, but I do like the way the cream goes on and the scent.</li>
    <li> I ordered because of a lady saying it smoothed lines around her mouth from her smoking.  I too have the same lines and want them gone.  I was so excited to start using this product and so disappointed the first week because I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference...I have zero patience.  I am so thrilled I kept using it anyway because within the month I could really tell. The best part was when my little sister noticed, she&#x27;s eight years younger and had the same problem. Now she is using it too!</li>
    <li> It actually works, but the bottle is tiny and I used it way too quickly for the price.</li>
    <li> VERNAL CREAM  ALL IN ONE IS A DISAPPOINTMENT IN MY OPINION.  HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED MUCH IMPROVEMENT SINCE I&#x27;VE USED IT.  I EXPECTED MORE CONSIDERING THE PRICE.  I&#x27;LL USE IT UP BUT PROBABLY NOT PURCHASE IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I love the moisturizer, but it&#x27;s much too small for the price. The serums in this line are larger and cheaper,and that just doesn&#x27;t make sense. Such a price isn&#x27;t justified for half an ounce. It is nice because it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin and there are no parabens.</li>
    <li> I use this on top of the Face serum by the same company and the three 3 products ( eye, and face serum) plus this is a good combo</li>
    <li> We like it ok so far.  It seems to be helping.  Have only used it a couple of weeks.  Too soon to say for sure.</li>
    <li> I received my product very fast and I love it</li>
    <li> smells like peppermint. not sticky, pretty good</li>
    <li> Pretty good product, moisturizes like it says.</li>
    <li> It has a refreshing smell and feel to it. It&#x27;s like putting silk on your skin. My skin feels great.  I would use this product again.</li>
    <li> Mark Twain once said? What we eat has a great deal to do with our health and state of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same holds true with healthy skin. One needs to put good, nourishing food in one&#x27;s body to have good skin, silky hair, etc.. Bottom line, your overall health relies on the right nutrition, so does the health of your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a real necessity to put the correct moisturizer on your face based on one&#x27;s age and skin type. As you age, the \\&quot;usual&#x27; kind of moisturizer might not serve. I am in my mid-60&#x27;s and have used many face creams and moisturizers over the years. I used Creme de la Mer and love it, but can no longer afford it. So, I went on a search for the next best thing - a moisturizer that really does \\&quot;the job\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. I finally heard about Vernal Moisturizer for aging skin. My friends who are using this cream/gel think it is wonderful. So, I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have learned that at the heart of every formula is the use of active ingredients with proven efficacy. Innovative technology is also necessary to provide a successful result at every level. Now I never look for \\&quot;miracle creams.\\&quot; Anti Aging - Vernal Moisturizer, with Tetrapeptide &amp; Vitamin C, seems  to smooth out wrinkles - of course, since this product is not magic, you will still have wrinkles, but Vernal diminishes them. I have noticed in the three months I have been using Vernal, that my skin&#x27;s elasticity has improved. The O2 complex, potassium, and B vitamins seem to give my skin a healthy glow. Some of the ingredients include: (zinc, grapefruit seed extract), which do reduce puffiness - I can see this result when I wake up in the morning, cleanse my facial skin  and Vernal seems to do the job, as promised in advertisements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prescription Retin or mytrixil-A is an active ingredient here which is used to reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and mottled skin discoloration, and to make rough facial skin feel smoother. I used Retinol when I used Creme de la Mer and it helps defoliate skin and promote new cell growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vernal is not greasy so it idea for both night and day. No grease marks on your pillow. This rich moisturizer is very gentle and easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, help your skin fight environmental damage and the effects of aging. Your skin regenerates itself every 28 days, so you will see some immediate results, but long-term results will be evident after a few months of use. My skin feels and looks great. I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a good replacement for La Mer...but I did! For me, this is it! Very highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;JANAinol when I used Creme de la Mer and it helps defoliate skin and promote new cell growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vernal is not greasy so it idea for both night and day.

    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 4 WEEKS AND NOTICE NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL. IS THIS TOO SOON?</li>
    <li> Makes skin so smooth and lines seem to be shrinking.  Smell is great also.  I think this will be a permanent face cream.</li>
    <li> I used one bottle of this moisturizer cream and thought it was ok but wasn&#x27;t convinced. So, I tried something else and quickly found out how much I really liked the Vernal Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream. It does seem to cut down on the visibility of wrinkles. I think I&#x27;m hooked now.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My skin is definitely firmer.</li>
    <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **  Great moisturizer. My skin feels smooth after using it. It&#x27;s so good my mother-in-law swipes it whenever I leave it laying around. Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about a month as a replacement of lifecell which I used for 6 years. I took the consideration of recent reviews and decided to try another product if so many people did not see changes with using lifecell. I have used it for so long I am not sure if it was doing any good or not anymore, I do know one tube lasted me approx. 4 months with daily use and I am already needing to reorder vernal after 1 month. It is half the oz. qty of life cell but if I have to order it 3x as often the price is actually more expensive for this cream so that is why I am giving only three stars. The cream seems of good quality and I &#x27;think&#x27; I notice a difference in my forehead wrinkles, that may be because I want to see a difference, I hate those wrinkles the most and I am using a new cream! I don&#x27;t think I look older since I quit using lifecell, not much younger since I started using vernal, maybe vernal is helping me to &#x27;keep up&#x27; with time so for now I am going to reorder and give it a few months to prove it&#x27;s claim.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for this moisturizing cream. I am able to get my girl friend a variety of moisturizing creams to try then review by receiving discounts to honestly review the products. We being 55+ yrs young any help is appreciated keeping our youthful glow! She absolutely loves the Vernal anti aging concentrated cream as she needs so very little for great effect, honestly I do NOT feel she needs any help but she really loved this, not greasy, no odor, needs a small dab only and makes her face feel very soft if not silky. I assumed it was natural but apparently it is enhanced by the anti aging cream. I went to try it and was told unequivocally NO! She really does love this cream.&lt;br /&gt;So 5 stars from us and she says we ARE reordering when she starts to run out.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about ten days. It feels pleasant going on but I see no differences in my skin. It advises to avoid getting the cream in your eyes and yet also tells me it is excellent for the area around the eyes which makes for some confusion.</li>
    <li> Not working with me...waist the money!</li>
    <li> Does not feel greasy.  I have not used this for but a week but I&#x27;m interested to see effects after a few weeks.  I use this with the AH</li>
    <li> I think this is great, I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews unless personally it just didn&#x27;t jibe with their skin. This cream is great for my T-zone area in particular. I supplement with a sunscreen and eye cream and have found it to be lightweight enough to be used under sunscreen during the day. One complaint--the bottle&#x27;s pump is missing the inner plastic tube so the pump doesn&#x27;t work. Otherwise, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. Glides on skin smoothly.</li>
    <li> this was far too harsh on my skin.  retinol is clinically proven to reduce wrinkles.  this makes alot of claims but they are not backed up by research.  so, why spend the $$ if there is no science behind it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vernal for about 2 weeks. The main thing I will say is I notice improved texture in my skin. Since i started using this moisturizer my skin looks and feels smoother. I also have seen lines seem diminished and my skin seems brighter. It seems to have more notable effects than anything else I&#x27;ve been using (I have used perricone, sk2, you name it). That said, the response I&#x27;ve been getting from people have been positive that will have me back here purchasing the stuff when I run out.... I feel like an addict, but i can&#x27;t help myself. If you can afford it, I think you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this. I am well over 60 and look much younger. It doesn&#x27;t absorb to the point where my skin feels dry, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin shiny, either. I live in a dry climate, so this may be too fluid for someone in a humid zone. After three weeks of continuos use I&#x27;ve noticed some wrinkles around my jaw lines diminished and are less visible. All in all, the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This cream is hydrating and leaves my skin feeling very nice the next morning. It does not break out my acne prone skin. I have tried many night creams and this is the best, so far that I have found. It has also diminished my lines and wrinkles. My skin feels hydrated. You&#x27;ll notice your skin looks great in the morning.</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my skin. I&#x27;m 51, and I&#x27;ve been using Vernal for about 4-5 months now and I have noticed a drastic improvement in my skin. Usually my skin can get a little rough, red, and dry at times, but when I put this on under my moisturizer, these problems are reduced greatly. I use this along with a Clairsonic Mia, and these two things combined has given me my best skin ever, hands down.</li>
    <li> I realize that nothing can turn back the hands of time and all the crazy claims that the skin care industry makes about their products is probably mostly baloney. However, I *think* this moisturizer is making my skin look and feel nicer. What does make it superior to other products I&#x27;ve used is that is doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy or slimy; it stays on when I sweat; it doesn&#x27;t smell weird. I like it a lot and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great cream. Moisturizes very well. Smooth feeling. Lovely look to my skin after using it!</li>
    <li> So far so good! I love the product and the smell is great!</li>
    <li> I often have a hard time finding moisturizers that don&#x27;t make my combination skin feel greasy or didn&#x27;t help with the dry areas.  I was happy to discover that this one left my skin feeling smooth and not oily or dry. One bottle lasted a long time too which is a nice bonus. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is FANTASTIC! I noticed a remarkable improvement the very first time I used it. It has changed the texture and look of my skin, and I am clearly producing more collagen, which is a claimed affect of the product. . This product is moisturizing, anti-aging and not irritating to my hyper sensitive skin. All this improvement came within the first two weeks of trying this product by the time you are on your second bottle you will be transformed for the best!</li>
    <li> As a person who&#x27;s aging and having oily skin I highly recommend this cream. During the day our skin takes a beating and this the perfect end of the day moisturizers since it does not have any SPF. It feels heavy when you get some out but it goes on light. I absolutely love this product. It does not make me break out and I love the texture of the cream and how beautiful my skin looks. A+</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks in a month!</li>
    <li> I do see a difference in my skin. It seems clearer, less dry, and perhaps firmer. I will order more and see what happens after using for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I could feel and see the difference in my skin after only one week.  Believe this is going to become a regular in my cabinet.  Thanks for producing a product that actually holds true to its advertised description.</li>
    <li> I easily have several hundred dollars (or more) of facial moisturizers, pore minimizers, skin firming products...etc, in my bathroom right now.  I also see an aesthetician monthly for chemical peels, and have purchased products from their line as well.  Some, I like more than others.  But I have never, ever fallen in love with a product as I have with this one.  It has a texture unlike any other moisturizer.  It instantly lifts the skin, it tightens it....but it also gives a glow (not an oily one) that is so natural looking it&#x27;s almost not believable.  I use it every morning after I wash my face.  Give it a few minutes to set in, and then makeup goes on flawlessly.  If you count on things like makeup primers or base products....and can kiss them all goodbye.  This amazing product does it all.  And for only $40?  Almost too good to believe.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the good reviews. After about 4 weeks of using this product I truly feel it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Definitely saw results. I love the texture of this cream. It feels like a cushion on my skin. I have spent a lot of money on other products claiming the same with very few results. I used the cream and within 2 weeks I was getting compliments on my skin!! I highly recommend this product. I have discoloration, fine lines and wrinkles so I was very hesitant on trying this, however I have had no reaction other than improvements. This product is a must have!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product but a little too expensive on my budget</li>
    <li> This cream is hydrating and leaves my skin feels very nice the next morning. It does not break out my acne prone skin. I confess I am not the best at taking care of my skin in the evening. I get tired and often go to bed without even washing my face. Bad, I know. However, when I use this product, in the morning my skin is visibly better looking. I can only imagine how it would look if I used this every night! A goal to work toward. Yes, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Perhaps to early to judge real results but sofa just a nice cream.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin but am starting to get wrinkles, so I wanted a product that could moisturize my skin without making it feel greasy. This product is perfect for this! It is light and luxurious, so you only need a little bit of product for application. My skin is soft, smooth, and while nothing gets rid of the wrinkles and sags, I do feel my face is firmer. Makeup goes on smoothly and I don&#x27;t need heavy coverage to have an even look. If you&#x27;re unsure at least try the sample size. I think you&#x27;ll be sold.</li>
    <li> Im 54 yrs old have dry skin. I was using the la mer for about 6 months and just switched to Vernal. Within 1 week I have seem a softening on the lines around my mouth &amp; between my eyebrows. Not greasy, soaks right in and my skin is soft and smooth as could be. Expensive yes, but it works. The cream is thicker than la mer but doesn&#x27;t sink into lines. Of course at my age I dont worry too much about zits and it does not clog my pores. I even dab it around the eyes before bed. I highly recommend you try it. A little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product. It really did nothing at all except make me sweat the minute I put it on and when it got close to my eyes it was like having an allergy. I thought it would at least moisten and hydrate my face but it does not even do that. I will look into other products but not this one. It is not even good as a simple facial moisturizer or lotion.</li>
    <li> Okay results -- nothing miraculous. Has a bit of a tacky, greasy feel with an interesting scent.</li>
    <li> I like every thing about this item.</li>
    <li> crap for the $$ used it with vivexin...save your dollars!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve spent any money on anti-aging.... anything really. I have tried drugstore ones, but not really because I needed them, more like because I needed cleaning wipes and chose those over plain ones, that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I read the reviews and chose this one. I just turned 30 last month, so I only have some fine lines. I had a lot of skin imperfections, however, such as dark spots and overall uneven blotchiness. Acne isn&#x27;t normally an issue for me, but a new medication caused me to get a horrible break out that left me with dark marks that I couldn&#x27;t even cover up without being obvious. After I got rid of the acne, I decided to look for something to get rid of the marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week and a half, only 2 spots were still standing. I had some mild, fine lines around my eyes and mouth from being a smoker for 10 years, and these are gone now that a month has passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, even if the lines and spots were still there; I would continue to use this product because my skin is no longer blotchy, it&#x27;s firmer and I have a nice smooth complexion. People have been asking me what I&#x27;ve been doing - they can&#x27;t put their fingers on it, but they say I have a glow to me and that I look great. That&#x27;s definitely worth the money, in my book.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels so good on my skin and knowing that it is making my skin younger looking and feeling is even more reason to use it.</li>
    <li> This cream does not break me out, does not feel like I have a thick film on my face. Feels fresh and wonderful on. I definitely notice my skin looks better and firmer when I use this everyday. I use it twice a day a. Over time, I my skin looks more hydrated and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I ordered it by accident. I was looking for a famous brand but same type I product. But I do not bother to return it because it&#x27;s not expensive and it makes my skin feeling so good. It&#x27;s a surprise I plan to get the second bottle when it&#x27;s running out.</li>
    <li> Skin felt lifted &amp; tighter!  I loved the smooth appearance it gave to my face. I will be buying another!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as moisutizing as I expected.  I have to apply it twice just to get my makup not to clump,  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as advertised and would like to know if the company has a slightly higher and more moisturizing cream</li>
    <li> My mum seems to like it. It&#x27;s worth the money so yeah idk ask my mum ok yeah bye ok</li>
    <li> I saw results after three weeks of use and my skin continues to look better every day. With other creams the products felt sticky and sat like a thick layer on top of my skin. This product was completely opposite of that. It was smooth and absorbed immediately. With those other products sometimes they had an unpleasant odor, others had very strong scents. This product had a nice minty scents, which I find particularly nice as I don&#x27;t have to worry about mixing scents. I already noticed a remarkable difference in my skin - so much softer and glowing with a few wrinkle lines fading. I would recommend using it at night since it has no SPF. Overall, a great product</li>
    <li> I am in love with this moisturizer. It has noticeably brightened my complexion, faded some fine lines around my face and offered a lovely amount of moisture. The smell is great, and it has kind of a cooling/tingling sensation when you put it on. I have combo skin (dry on cheeks and chin, oily on forehead) - and this works great under my makeup. This is now a staple in my beauty routine. If you love a dewy glow,clear skin and hydrated face with anti aging benefits. Then,this is the moisturizer for you.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  It really works.  I noticed a difference after about a week&#x27;s usage.  I wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I am 38 years old and have sun spots, freckles and dry skin. Recently I noticed that the area around my mouth was sagging and the laugh lines seemed more pronounced. Although I use great products on my skin, I was not using an anti wrinkle cream. Can I just say that the sagging is gone and the laugh lines are significantly minimized! This product is really amazing! I did not give it five stars simply because I have not seen the dark spots lightened. However, I have only used it for about two weeks. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well, so far, it is odorless, which is good, doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or dirty feeling.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging it came in and I think it would make a great gift, whether giving or receiving it. I also liked that the pump dispensed a small amount which is all you need to cover your face. Some bottles dispense a lot at once and you have to be careful to pump half way or risk wasting moisturizer, which can be a hassle. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or sticky and it absorbs well and can be easily used under makeup. I haven&#x27;t had this product for very long so I can&#x27;t make judgements on anti aging but my skin does feel well moisturized and someone complimented my skin yesterday so I am feeling happy about this product.</li>
    <li> I used this for months and cant say that I noticed any difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product! It&#x27;s seems to give my skin a nice glow and its firming too! I can really tell a difference!</li>
    <li> I like this product and just ordered the serum.....I had Minor breakouts but I think that&#x27;s to be expected when you switch products.</li>
    <li> I have used Thai product as directed for 3 weeks and don&#x27;t see a bit of difference in my skin. I have to use 2-3 pumps cover my face, neck and décolleté.  I was hoping for some results by now. Disappointing so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this purchase.Im 42 and you need primer before you apply your foundation with this one. It feels sticky when you have primer&amp; foundation on.If you do not use primer it&#x27;s too dry and sits in your lines even when using an antiaging foundation.I tried to save some money and go with this one based on reviews but I&#x27;ll gladly pay a lot more money for another all in one product that seems to even have a primer in it. Your make up goes on like satin and all fine lines are blurred.Sometimes you get what you pay for! Don&#x27;t believe the hype or maybe I have weird skin that doesn&#x27;t agree with this product.</li>
    <li> A cream half the price is just as good.  I did not notice any difference.</li>
    <li> Very good working intense product.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at some of the reviews and seems like this is more for the mature skin type but I can tell you it does wonders for all ages.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is important to start early with anti-aging and this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth not sticky&lt;br /&gt;Will last more than a month&lt;br /&gt;No Parabens&lt;br /&gt;No Sulfates&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have notice a better texture to my skin and it is more bright. In two weeks I have noticed a difference and will continue to use and update.</li>
    <li> Noticed immediately results, and I mean within a week I started getting compliments on my skin again. My pores are smaller and my skin is smoother. I&#x27;ve noticed some new fine lines have also diminished . It goes on light and weightless with no problems. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause any breakouts. I highly recommend this product for anyone .Love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a little while. When it comes to skin care products, I like to use the whole bottle before making a decision about it. Let&#x27;s face it, some things take time and I want to give this product the opportunity to do what it says it will. First impressions so far; I like the texture, very smooth and glides on the skin.  I also like the  fresh smell. But as far as results....I&#x27;ll check in later on that.</li>
    <li> As a person who&#x27;s aging and having oily skin I highly recommend this anti aging cream. During the day our skin takes a beating and this the perfect end of the day moisturizer. It feels light when you get some out and it absorbs quickly. My skin feels hydrated. Overall my skin looks really good, glowing, and smaller pores. (I have medium pores, oily skin, and spend way too much on finding good products. This is it for me).</li>
    <li> fast shipping and good product..was better than i thought it would  be</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t do anything for me, except run out fast.  The texture is nice and it feels nice on my face, but it didn&#x27;t firm or tighten my skin in any way.</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered right on schedule.</li>
    <li> As a man its hard to shop around for any skin type moisturizer. This is now my new favorite! I was looking for a new line of skin care, and found Vernal. I been using this for a a few weeks and it does a great job hydrating my skin especially after shaving since it drys out my neck and face too much. This product is just as good for gents as it is for the ladies.</li>
    <li> There are warnings to not get this product near your eyes and to flush eyes if it does.  What?  A cream that&#x27;s dangerous?  Nonsense.  And it didn&#x27;t moisturize.  i returned it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used for a few days, so have not noticed any difference.  The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is some redness and itchiness in my face.  Don&#x27;t know if this is normal for everyone.  Will continue to use for at least 2 weeks to see if there is any improvement and/or the redness and itchiness stop.</li>
    <li> I have used peptide serums for several years now and have been very happy with the result. However, I need a hydrating lotion during the winter, too. This product does a decent job of hydrating my dry skin and the peptides minimally tighten my skin. So, I have to add my customary serum to this lotion to achieve the full effect.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a couple of weeks.  Not seeing the dramatic results yet that some stated.  Then again I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s so it may take longer to see results.  I have noticed that my face is clearer as I am prone to clogged pores and acne.  Not completely acne free but better.  Will update again after a month.  Product did arrive on time, no issues with packaging or bottle.&lt;br /&gt;*******&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I have been using this for over a month now.  Fantastic results.  I use two squirts every morning.  My skin is smooth, wrinkles have almost disappeared, skin tone is even, and my face is very clear.  I would get painful cyst like pimples on my chin and the dermatologist told me it would continue until menopause since it was hormonal. Proactiv did not work and antibiotics temporarily worked.  I have not had a single one since I started using this product.  My pores have reduced all over.  I had a spot they said was rosacea and it is gone.  I may even be able to go out this summer without foundation or powder.  I recommended my boyfriend use it since he is outside in the weather. I expect to see better results from him.  I am about to order my second bottle.  I have not had any issues with the pump or bottle but also don&#x27;t carry it around, it stays on the counter.  Best my skin has looked in a decade.</li>
    <li> Great product but very expensive for the size.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading the reviews and decided I would try it and see if I got the same results. I was truly amazed at how quickly my fine laugh lines completely disappeared ! I know, I see you rolling your eyes. I have very sensitive skin that is also extremely dry. I have been using this product for a few weeks and notice a huge difference in the way my skin looks immediately after I apply it. I also have gotten many people ask me how it is at my age I have no wrinkles ? I gave it four stars because the Vernal is pretty expensive. I will be interested to see how long it lasts and if I think it was worth enough to buy another bottle. Color me impressed !</li>
    <li> Love the minty fragrance and the feel of the cream on my skin.</li>
    <li> it is really nice, I feel my face smooth when I use it</li>
    <li> it did not have enough moistuer for my skin here in Arizona in the winter, but I would like to try it in the summer, i am 64</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally spend anything near to this on moisturizers, but wow. You get what you pay for. Never again will I use a cheap one. This stuff smells great, is lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to form new acne, like most other moisturizers did. I&#x27;m in love. A little goes a long way so even though its pricey, it&#x27;ll last! INVEST IN THIS!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT CREAM--after one night there was noticeable decrease in fine lines, amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Could feel moisture absorption in my skin. Creame is effective. Would recommend to others especially to decrease wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has saved my skin. It&#x27;s super moisturizing, smells amazing, soaks in well, and does not leave my skin greasy. It&#x27;s also nasty chemical free and a good value! A little goes a long way and there is quite a lot in this bottle compared to other products. Light weight but wears well even under makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the item for a few days, I haven&#x27;s seen a change yet, but I just started using it.  I have high hopes!  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I had REALLY deep lines around my t-line and neck. I love this product and I do think it has helped after using it for 1 month. It is not a quick fix. Feels good on, is thick enough and doesn&#x27;t have a shine and absorbs quickly. It feels fabulous on my skin and works for me. Would buy again</li>
    <li> To me this product is not even compare to a Aveeno lotion, I used this (vernal Anti aging) for a month I don&#x27;t see a thing changed on my skin, so it&#x27;s a wasted. It&#x27;s not cheap to try. I bought this (Vernal Anti Aging) because I go by those reviews in Amazon, I believed those people putted common in Amazon got by either by the Manufacture or Amazon. It&#x27;s $44 should help little bit, but it&#x27;s does not.</li>
    <li> I did not work for me.  When you have excessively dry skin you have to be very careful with your selection of face cream.  Be sure to check the ingredients in the product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is light and it absorbs upon application but it also has a minty fragrance. I do not mind having a mint, but not a minty fragrance that is applied to my face. This bottle is very small, one fl. Oz., as it states in the description, but for some reason I was surprised, that it is the same size as my facial serums. Face serum requires only a few drops, which is much less than an application for a moisturizer. I have been using it twice a day as recommended, and almost 3 weeks later I have very little cream left. I feel that the price, even on sale is expensive for this small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Skin Results:&lt;br /&gt;Vernal Anti-Aging Moisturizing Cream did keep my dry skin moisturized, but then again so will an inexpensive drug store moisturizer. Due to the very short time of usage, as I am almost finished with this product, I really was not able to determine any real difference regarding the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, nor any improvement of elasticity or structural lift. I cannot give a report about age spots because I do not have any, neither do I have a problem with dark circles, and any puffiness around my eyes stayed the same. Now, I do understand that any improvements require a more time and a lot more product to see any reaction, but I just cannot see the justification of spending about $44.00 a month (which is a solid 25% discount), on a product for a year or longer just to see if I may or may not receive any positive results. This is a shame because if the price was cut in half, or if the product was twice the amount I might have considered using it for a longer period.</li>
    <li> I noticed results immediately. Great for my sensitive skin! Doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn, and really provides a lot of hydration. Just what I was looking for, and best of all a little goes a long way! There has been a noticeable lessening of facial wrinkles since using this product line. I wish that I had known about this line many years ago.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a really nice &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; to it, making it easy to apply. Love Love Love the soft, luxurious, quickly, absorbing moisture restoring quality that this cream delivers instantly to my face and neck! It&#x27;s so scrumptious that I indulge my hands too! I have very dry and sensitive skin which drinks in this glorious light-weight, non-greasy winter wonder.While it feels lightweight, it provides serious moisture.</li>
    <li> This is the 1st moisturizer I truly see results with. Goes on light and non-greasy. Product absorbs immediately, never leaves skin greasy but works to keep skin hydrated amazingly well. Keeps my skin firm. I only use a little bit, and it&#x27;s good. I&#x27;m very satisfied. My face does not break out anymore, and I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> For those who are approaching their older years, it is great and effective. Very refreshing!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Have been using it for a couple of weeks now. Time will tell but satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> Amazing ..!!!! feels like an instantly lift  ..!!</li>
    <li> This version of a cream appears to be more concentrated but lightweight nonetheless. It goes on smoothly, though, in my case. The cream gets absorbed pretty quickly and makes my skin baby soft in the morning. The cream has a nice light mint scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face cream was the answer I was looking for!!! It&#x27;s light and blends easily into your skin while at the same time providing just the right amount of moisturizing impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all of you out there spending way too much on top shelf face creams, I highly recommend saving a bundle and switching to this product…you know who you are!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful face cream! It&#x27;s not greasy at all, yet manages to be truly moisturizing. I am almost 60 and have never found a moisturizer that really worked for me until now! I can see a dramatic change in the lines on my face and overall appearance of my face. This does not make my skin break out like so many other moisturizers I have tried. My skin feels really good. The product lasts a good amount of time for me. I am looking forward to trying their serum too. Pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is light to have on face. I do not see results on wrinkles yet. After a month or two I will give another review.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer absorbs very fast and leaves my skin soft! Great for night time. Maybe when the winter comes it would be perfect for day as well. I am a fan of the smell. It has a nice smell of a mint face wash that I&#x27;ve been using too.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet....this product seems to me making my face a bit dry. I will keep using and update my rating. Also a little does not go a long way, it seems I have to use a lot.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet, but I don&#x27;t want to start getting them either - so I thought it was about time I tried an anti-aging line. The cream smells great, has a great consistency (not too heavy, but not so light that it absorbs leaving skin wanting for moisture). I&#x27;ve mainly used it at night after washing my face, and it has kept my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritations - it does help with combination skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it for price. I have less expensive products that work just as well</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference from using this.</li>
    <li> More junk, doesn&#x27;t work and causes skin rash.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is the reason, but my wife sure looks good!</li>
    <li> I do not see results yet, but have not been using long</li>
    <li> Used for about three months and honestly didn&#x27;t see a change. I purchased based on the great reviews so it was a little disappointing. On to the next one!</li>
    <li> In the process of reviewing this product. I will post more info soon regarding product. I just received at a deeply discount price to review this product.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a sample, and was really excited to try it as I had heard good things about this brand. I was not disappointed! Even just overnight my skin felt softer and more radiant, and some lines were less visible. It feels fabulous on my skin, soaks in quickly, and works for me.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me but I am sure it is because I am a much older woman.</li>
    <li> Save your money.  Does not perform as stated.</li>
    <li> Best aging moisturizer I have ever used. My complexion is so much better!</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful hydrating lotion! I love it so much! It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out and it makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
    <li> This product feels good on your skin and smells great but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I love being able to say that this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used and really truly mean it. My skin is normally quite oily and prone to breakouts--while I&#x27;m on the east coast. This moisturizer not only moisturized PERFECTLY (not even a hint of grease remains after it absorbs), it cleared my skin and left the most wonderful glow. My skin is RADIANT and perfect, I wish I could bathe in this stuff. I have slathered this stuff all over my chin and nose, the worst place for my acne--and not a zit in sight.&lt;br /&gt;The most refreshing treat whenever your skin needs moisture. And as long as you apply it thinly and let it absorb, it doesn&#x27;t accumulate and pill like some moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff raises the bar for what a five-star product should be. Unreal.</li>
    <li> Seriously loving this product, it feels so nice and light weight on my skin but yet deeply hydrates. It&#x27;s fast absorbing, doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy residue or make your face feel oily. 5 stars ! :)</li>
    <li> I have spent probably around $1000 in the past two years in my search for the perfect products for my skin-- I have extreme combination skin, suck dry cheeks and hairline, super oily t zone, also very sensitive and prone to breakouts. Vernal is something I just kind of tried on a whim and it has been a game changer. Can not sing it&#x27;s praises enough. The products just sink into the skin and leave my super dry cheeks with plenty of moisture and my t zone not at all greasy or oily. How is this possible!!! I am in love. I will sing the praises of this line high and low.</li>
    <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about it &amp; I also am not raving over it !&lt;br /&gt;Its good but for that price I can buy something similar or better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product faithfully for almost 4 months I haven&#x27;t see a difference. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer along with their other product (the spot corrector) when my friend told me how happy she was with it. I been using the moisturizer in the at night before I got to bed because it does not have SPF however after 2 weeks of using this product my fine lines are far less noticeable. My skin texture is sooo silky and much smoother.  I never thought I would find a moisturizer that I loved better than Vernal but ladies and gets this is my new love. Hope others get the same results I&#x27;m getting!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Very nice stuff at a nice price. Nice moisturizer and seems to be working well on my 63 year old face. Ive only used it for about a week so I cant really say too much yet. My skin responds well to new products so time will tell if it coninues to work but so far, I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> really did not live up to it&#x27;s expectations.</li>
    <li> OK, as a public figure, I get a ton of products offered to me.... when it comes to skin care, I usually turn them down. My skin is soooo sensitive that I can&#x27;t even use the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; creams that are out there, so I resorted to using only coconut oil as a moisturizer for my face. But I decided to try Vernals anti-aging moisturizer because the ingredients in it are exceptional. I was totally surprised when I could actually tell the difference in my skin the same day I started using it. My skin is retaining moisture, instead of feeling dry... and there&#x27;s no greasy feeling afterwards... it all soaks into my skin. As a singer, I get my photos taken all the time and it&#x27;s important for me to look my best..... with Vernal, I can count on keeping my youthful skin for the rest of my life. I mean, why wait until you see signs of aging to start a healthy skin care program, when you can prevent it from happening in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WildFlower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;m even using it on my hands now and it&#x27;s stopped the red blotches that appear each winter from chapping. in it&#x27;s tracks. My hands love it too!</li>
    <li> Used the entire bottle following the directions but saw little to no improvements in wrinkle depth or skin texture.  Will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> amazing product ordered another bottle</li>
    <li> It has been effective but I thought it could be better looking at the price etc.</li>
    <li> I am 59 years old, have used this daily for almost 3 months now, and have NO facial wrinkles! This is my second product from this brand and even my 84 year old mother uses it every day faithfully, as well! I wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else. Overall this moisturizer compares to the most expensive ones at department stores minus the hefty price tag and greasiness! Easy to apply, light and visible moisture! Does not make my skin oilier during the day and I feel my skin is clean and light throughout the day, regardless if I cam wearing make up the rest of day or not.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product works as promised. My &amp;#34;over 60&amp;#34; skin really looks and feels better. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I can really see a difference. Even after the first 3 days. I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product so far. I&#x27;ve been looking for a moisturizer for years that helps with anti aging. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t use this product because it is making my skin very red.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give  5 stars because I really love this product. However, less than a month ago it ran out! I try to be frugal and do use it sparingly. I love that it is in pump form for health reasons, but I have read about pumps malfunctioning, resulting in much less product being delivered. Love  the product itself because it is natural and has a light scent: not happy with the mechanics of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this. You can totally tell a someones age by looking at her face, but this product really makes a difference. This is the 2nd brand of anti aging cream I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s definitely the better one. This one doesn&#x27;t make my face itch like the other one and, even though you get about the same amount, this one seems like it will last at least twice as long. It definitely does everything it says it will and makes my face look very smooth. I saw a picture of myself taken the other night at our company holiday party and the first thing I noticed was how smooth and young my 43-year-old face looked!!! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> There were some smells that I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for about a week so not sure yet what it can do. However, it does seem to tighten a bit and it sinks right in with no greasy feeling. So far I like it!.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as Life Cell, which I tried prior to this product.  I wanted it to, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love what this anti aging cream has done to my skin. Not only does it keep the hydration locked in, it has tightened up my skin! I feel like I am regaining my elasticity in my skin which is something that I thought I would never have again. I can’t get enough of this product!!!</li>
    <li> Not the best, my face broke out and got like leather:(</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I had ordered a peptide cream from a competing company.  This one goes on smoother, does not sting. Much less expensive also.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin and everything I have tried so fair only helped a little....until this cream!&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant scent, its thick and after 2 days of use, My skin is soft, smooth and already looking younger</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Will be reordering!</li>
    <li> I almost never post reviews because that is just not my thing.  I am making an exception for an exceptional product.  After just one week my mature skin looks smoother, is softer and my wrinkles are less noticeable.  The product has NO annoying scent--is easy to use--comes in a pump so you don&#x27;t have to stick your fingers in a jar and cause contamination.  It is the first product I have used in a long time that has made a visible difference and I should know because I have tried soooooo many and really even the most expensive products---- looking for the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Seeing is believing as to how well this product works!  I am getting ready to order my second bottle even though I have only have used half of the current one.  I do not want to be without even for a day.  I use it twice a day even under my makeup. My friends are complimenting me asking what I do to have such lovely skin.  I stumbled on this product by accident and figured I would give it a try as the cost was so much more reasonable then what I usually spend.  What a great surprise!  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product as I never would have come across it otherwise.</li>
    <li> did not like it it dried my skin</li>
    <li> this is a pricey moisturizer; started using it recently. feels nice on; not greasy; oily.. the scent is kind of minty; but other than that not bad.</li>
    <li> I am impressed and it takes a lot to impress me. My skin loves this cream and literally drinks it up. The texture isn&#x27;t heavy or sticky like Crème de la Mer.Vernal Cream is smooth . The scent is very light, almost mint like. My skin texture improved after using it a short time. I didn&#x27;t break out from this cream either which is a plus. This is one that I will definitely stay loyal to.</li>
    <li> Such a good moisturizer! I&#x27;ve had acne (the painful cystic type) since my early teens (now in my mid 20&#x27;s), and this has been the only moisturizer that hasn&#x27;t left my skin too dry or too greasy. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so and I love the way my skin is looking. Haven&#x27;t had a new breakout in a week (which is rare!). It does have a strong smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after you rub it in. And best part is you only need about one pump!</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day to get the best results. This product does what it claims it does. I have been using this product for over 2 months, and will continue using it..Worked great on neck and forehead area. I would recommend the product. Works great for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it two weeks so the jury is still out.  I think one of the ugly dark spots above my lip is beginning to lighten.  I&#x27;m giving it another week and do a before and during photo.  What I like is, the moisturizer and the dark spot remover are not greasy at all, nor is the dark spot remover harsh.  I think I&#x27;m going to like this product.  I am 66 so there&#x27;s only so much you can do, right?  Younger people out there, start early and TAKE CARE OF YOUR SKIN.  I&#x27;m a perfect example of a sun worshiper from back in the 60&#x27;s and was warned but never listened.  Now if I&#x27;m out in the sun long, I get even more brown spots :-(</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin, but I&#x27;ve only had it a week or so.</li>
    <li> Gross. This causes bad skin reactions.</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of this product with another purchase. It was so smooth and moisturizing that I will definitely be putting on my wish list!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice lotion. It has a cooling minty effect. I didn&#x27;t honestly see a huge difference in my skin though, but it may be something you have to use for a long time.  I&#x27;m only 23 so I use stuff to prevent aging rather than to rewind it. If you are older and looking for results I would go for something firming...because this does not lift or fill lines.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of various anti aging products through the years and this is by far the&lt;br /&gt;best anti aging moisturizer cream I have ever used!  I experienced results within 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful to find a product that actually does what it says it will do and for a reasonable&lt;br /&gt;price too!</li>
    <li> Found my new great product. After three kids and probably just getting older, I notice my face change from an oily to combination type to very dry, dull skin with fine lines forming, Got this as a sample in a VIP bag at an event and tried it in place of my BeautiControl moisturizing cream. I noticed a actual difference after one use, my face felt more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and moist. Purchased my on and am half way through, but can honestly say that for my skin, this really is amazing. The area around the eyes shows the most improvement. This does the trick for me and gives an overall firmness/brightness.</li>
    <li> I picked this moisturizer up a couple of weeks ago and I am absolutely in love! I use to have oily skin and for some reason this year my skin type changed to not dry but normal with texture issues. It has def made a difference. I use it as my day time and night time moisturizer and I love the smell. It smells exactly like mint to me. So fresh! This is the first Vernal product I have used and I am dying to try more!</li>
    <li> definitely not worth the money...very small amount and I see no difference, will never purchase again.....</li>
    <li> OK, but won&#x27;t buy again.  Too pricey, it&#x27;s all about skin care routine, and exercise.  Sweat cleans pores, minimize pores, less wrinkles.</li>
    <li> A little,pricey for such a small amount. Good product, but will not buy it again. Just too expensive.</li>
    <li> I like it. It does as well as other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Really like this as a moisturizer. It blends well over my Hyaluronic Acid Serum and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I was alternating with other face creams, but now just use this. Sometimes I use it as a night cream if I don&#x27;t want to use a heavier night cream. The only draw back is that it doesn&#x27;t give an instant lift nor does it have SPF, so I also use Obagi SPF over it during the day. If it did do an instant lift &amp; have SPF, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Good value for the price!</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift to my mom, she loves it! Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I didn&#x27;t see so many positive reviews.I have to say that the both I and my wife have excellent results and applying this once day.Not on that this skin is smoother but also dead dark circles under eyes filled up and almost disappeared. Excellent product and that good price since this little bottle will last for many months.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t  see the results others reported, and it is much more expensive than other moisturizers I have used.  So I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Initially, I was looking for a product for a few wrinkles around my face. I came across a Vernal ad and got my attention. Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for product but I was desperate to eliminate wrinkles and other signs of aging. After a few days I noticed my whole face seemed hydrated.. I use all it on most mornings &amp; evenings. The days I’m too tired or lazy to apply the products; my face looks dull :( I love that I can apply the products then a little concealer and my face glows. As for the anti aging I can see some results so far so I can&#x27;t wait to finish the bottle and see the difference.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff....Makes my skin feel super soft not greasy or heavy! Love the very soft scent. Will never stop using this moisturizer! Thank you so much! You wont go wrong purchasing this! :)</li>
    <li> A little to pricey and do not get near you eyes - but seems to work OK</li>
    <li> Would be so happy to get to try but I didn&#x27;t get it! Wow, that is something new:(</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream does moisturize my skin but I cant say that I have noticed any improvement in my skins texture. I am 51 yrs old and am starting to get fine lines around my mouth area that I was a bit concerned about. I used this product every night for a month &amp; like I said, didn&#x27;t see any improvement. I might have to try it for another month to give it a fair shot.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best moisturizers yet! I have sensitive skin and especially to anti-aging products but this leaves my face feeling smooth and looking airbrushed in the morning. All you need is a little bit and it goes a long way - not drying and not too greasy! ! Love it! Great product!</li>
    <li> Did not use...gifted to a friend</li>
    <li> Finally decided to post a review for others who may have the same reaction. This dried my skin. Read online that hyaluronic acid, which is one of the ingredients, can do that. Would have given it one star, but the comment is &#x27;I hate it&#x27; and I don&#x27;t feel hate is appropriate...never use that word.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say but there is no viseble change .</li>
    <li> Bad product. Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Most moisturizers are either good for the daytime or good for the night but never really for both. Since using this product I have not needed ‘special’ moisturizers for the time of day. I can apply this one both in the morning and night and never have that greased up feeling. IT’S GREAT</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin and have tried everything on the shelf to help me with my fine lines and texture. I&#x27;ve even tried lifecell, spending a lot of money on something that just was not working. I been using this product for close to a week now, I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have commented to me about the near total lack of wrinkles on my 64-year-old face! I talk to friends and relatives via Skype and when they see my complexion they tell me about how my cheeks are &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;, and smooth.</li>
    <li> I will always make sure to have this at hand! My skin has improved dramatically since using this product. Less breakouts, splotches, and hydration without feeling like I rubbed oil all over my face. Another thing that I LOVE about this product is I can use the smallest amount and still get the coverage and moisture I need.</li>
    <li> I dislike being nagged to give feedback, and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have any idea of whether it is like every other product like this I have tried or not.............</li>
    <li> Loving this moisturizer. Love the refeshing smell and feeling it leaves. Definitely can tell a defference in my skin. Highly recommend. I would have given it 5 stars if it had an SPF in it.</li>
    <li> Product did seem to work, my small wrinkles disappeared.  I did not however like the feel of it.  It made my skin very tight.  I have used aloe vera gel alone (an ingredient in this product) and it gives that tight feeling.  It also unfortunately made my face break out.  I tried the more expensive product, Hyaluronic Acid Serum Cream, which works, makes my skin feel wonderful, and doesn&#x27;t make it break out</li>
    <li> The date shipping was. It seems to be effective in order to improve the facial wrinkles to in use. It is not possible to be sure that you are using, but the effect will appear. Let&#x27;s re-leave a review later</li>
    <li> I rated this product a 5 because he sent me the product in an envelope and the item broke.  He refunded my money and gave me a new bottle in a box.  As far as the product, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference on my face.  I thought it would have more moisturizer in it.  It has good ingredients in it though, so I&#x27;m going to continue using it.  Great seller.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, tends to lighten and tighten the skin.  Adds moisture and makes face feel smooth while not oily. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my new favorite moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks, and even after the first few days&#x27; use, I noticed that it was really toning down the redness in my face! I am so grateful to this moisturizer. It absorbs super quickly and leaves my skin very soft and supple without any grease.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used. It works well with the Vernal serum. Together these products have made my skin look younger. I have been using them for 6 months.</li>
    <li> No change on my skin????????  Don&#x27;t get the hype.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this on behalf of my best friend who is getting a little older and saw that she had a few wrinkles.  She&#x27;s all about beauty and keeping herself in the best shape and look possible, so I bought this (offsite) as a birthday present.  She&#x27;s been using it a while, and we have talked extensively about how it&#x27;s been working for her.  Here is a mix of my impression along with her feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is very creamy, which makes application straightforward.  She has combination skin, so it&#x27;s also important that it glide on evenly, which it does.  The result is that it gives just enough moisture.  In time, we have both noticed that she&#x27;s needed less primer than in the past.  It&#x27;s likely because of how well the cream does at smoothing the skin.  It should go without saying that the cream smells great, too.  It&#x27;s been a few months, and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell she had any wrinkles before.  Her face looks great.  (The guys she&#x27;s gone out with since then would agree, too, I bet!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, based on the importance to my friend, I did extensive research on anti-wrinkle creams, and Vernal kept coming up with overall great reviews.  I should have checked here first on Amazon, because the reviews left here are more expansive than those on other sites.  After just checking them, they all mirror what everyone else was saying.  The product works, and I know my best friend will purchase it again--this time out of her own pocket, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definite recommend for anyone looking to do way with the wrinkles</li>
    <li> Great product. It works.</li>
    <li> works great. it leaves my face and neck so soft the next morning. the scent is just perfect and not too strong. there are no stings to my face when i use this cream.</li>
    <li> It smells great, but it is not a really good moisturizer. It was a let down after using Vernal spot corrector. The spot corrector is amazing.</li>
    <li> Not really sure it has moisturizing properties.  Using it a few days now,and finding I am still using an OTC moisturizer to feel any difference.  Let you know after a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> Too small for the price</li>
    <li> Normally I try to keep my beauty regimen on a tight budget. However, every now and then I believe that you should splurge on a higher end product to really get the trick done. This moisturizer is heaven! You really do get the bang for the buck out of it because you only need a little drop for full coverage. I’ve been noticing some results of my fine lines fading but I have only been using it for around two weeks. I am looking forward to what my skin will look like in a month!</li>
    <li> Have not seen a difference in my skin yet.. Not sure I would spend the money and buy this cream again:)</li>
    <li> Love it! It was hard to belief that you could see a difference in two or three days.  Well, it is true! Skin feels smoother and firm :)</li>
    <li> I have tried many different skin-care products.  Many have been outstanding, including this product.  However, I recommend Vernal Skincare not only because of its apparent effectiveness, but also, because of its price.  Outstanding product . . . Outstanding results.</li>
    <li> GREAT ORODUCT , It works !!!!!.</li>
    <li> I ordered Skinlastin wrinkle cream from the Skinlastin web site. It is very expensive and is the worst cream ever! Don&#x27;t buy that. I read all kings of reviews that were fantastic so I just had to have it.  I am going to give this 3 stars because it is made by the same company. horrible product. Dry the skin so much and causes wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product. I use it in combination with another set that was promoted on Facebook as &amp;#34;Ellen&#x27;s&amp;#34; secret anti-aging products, so I gave it a try. So far I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My face is softer, pores are smaller, wrinkles are less noticible. I am 38 &amp; mostly just have smile lines and a few crows feet. I have always used face products in my adult life &amp; always been diligent about using twice daily. I have also spent lots of money on designer type products. This in combination with the other set was around $100.</li>
    <li> This is pretty great stuff!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin, but I do love this product.  It is thick but absorbs quickly and without leaving a residue and it keeps my skin well moisturized.</li>
    <li> I saw no results and will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product! I think really helped my skin out!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for someone. They loved it and will be looking for more. It was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in a padded envelope by itself. No box, no instructions. The bottle was sealed, but it just didn&#x27;t look official. After a few weeks of use, I see absolutely no change. I will not be reordering but not even sure the product I have is official.</li>
    <li> My skin felt dry, tight, was flakey and it actually hurt it felt so tight and un-moisturized. Yuck.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, she said it feels like it tightens her skin, she uses it before we go out at night.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for me wife secretly because I saw her debating whether or not to get it. Knowing exactly what kind of product she wanted put the funniest look on her face! Anyways, she has been using the Vernal Moisturizer for a while now and is very happy with the results. Even I can tell that her skin appears more smooth, her eyes really look younger. We are both happy that I decided to surprise her with Vernal, and can only recommend this to any woman (or men trying to make up something to their wives )!</li>
    <li> i first found this cream because i googled  what would be the best face cream, and this product came up.  I found the positive reviews to be informative and helpful and convincing and the few poor reviews irrelevant to the product.  I have repurchased the product 3 or 4 times now.  I like the way it feels, i like the smell a lot, and I like the fact they state all their ingredients right on the label of the (bottle)  I am 59 yrs old, and this seems to be a good product for me.  It does not last a long time, but thats OK  it is quite a bit less expensive than anything at La Prairie, or many of the others.  The company is very good to work with, and their head of Customer Service, Adam Hertz is the best.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  It&#x27;s a little greay feeling but I&#x27;m satisfied and just ordered another bottle.  I told my daughter about it and she just purchased also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 36 with mild rosacea. This crem is the only one I have ever tried that did not irritate or cause breakouts for my combination to dry skin. I just started noticing slight signs of aging: very small start of wrinkles and the texture of my skin was getting a little rough. My skin is SO SOFT and smooth again I feel like I have teenage skin again!!! It is WORTH every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product for daytime use. I have very dry, sensitive skin and this goes on great under make up. I use prescription retinoids at night so my skin really needs this in the a.m.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as good and there wasn&#x27;t a tube as to be to use as a pump.</li>
    <li> I first ordered this about 8 months ago and I have to say I saw almost immediate results.  I kept thinking it couldn&#x27;t be this moisturizer working so fast, but it was!  I bought it mainly for firming up the skin above my eyes and overall keeping my skin tighter and younger looking.  After reading all the mostly positive reviews I figured I should try it and I am so glad I did.  I have since also added the serum to my face care routine, which is amazing also.  Things I have really noticed using these products include tighter, smoother skin, fine lines and wrinkles are diminished.  I love using these products on my face, they smell good and are not oily at all, the products absorb right into my skin, I have never used anything like it before...you can feel the difference almost immediately.  This has also helped my self image and confidence too, which is a major plus!</li>
    <li> I received a discount for my review. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and I can aleady see and feel a difference.  My skin definitely feels softer. I live in Vegas so it&#x27;s very dry. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I have been useing your product along with the moisterizer and eyejel. I have total thrilled with the results. I am 67 years old and many of my friends have asked  me how at my age or any age (some friends are over 10 years younger that me), my face has vertially no wrinkles and is smooth and beautiful. Even at my age they have called me beautiful. Seems to be a wonderful statement at my age. I use the syrum. I should say my wife uses your products. I am really happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t say noticed any huge change in skin, but feels good.</li>
    <li> I am 54 years old and have very dehydrated skin and a lot of fine and deep lines. The product appeared to hydrate my skin and minimize the appearance of lines. I think it was a great value for the money. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight moisturizer that works great alone for me, during the colder months I get so dry that my skin need a little more hydration and this takes care of that. . This moisturizer is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, it doesn&#x27;t burn, and it moisturizers perfectly without being greasy. It is better than more expensive products I have tried. I hope they never stop making this. The entire line is awesome.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 1/2 weeks now. At first, I did not think I was going to like it, it seemed to leave me a bit shiny, upon application. However, after a few minutes the absorption is awesome. I have also noticed improvements in my fine line. I come from a family where the women as they age become marionette mouths. I have worried about this, but I have noticed remarkable improvement there too.</li>
    <li> No miracles here...just ok</li>
    <li> I saw results soon and I will continue to use to the product.It seems to have brightened my complexion noticeably.</li>
    <li> i had tried the lifecell and wasnt happy with what i was seeing or feeling. My face felt dry and it just didnt seem to delivery what it promised for the price well it should have.  so id more research came up with vernal and im so happy i did.  my skin is soft and even though ive only been using it for 2 weeks i can see a difference lines are softer skins seems firmer. not sure how long a bottle will last but the price is reasonable.  cant wait to see the results in another two weeks.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great!  However, the pump applicator broke within a few uses, which I replaced with another pump.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend its use</li>
    <li> So far So good.  No complaints. Only started using it a couple days so far and seems to agree with my skin which is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> My wife is using it and likes it</li>
    <li> So far .. So good, I always use vitamin c cream on my face but when Dr. Oz suggested peptides for aging skin to plump it up ..I got online and ordered this and I like the way it feels as soon as I am applying ,  just one pump is all you need to apply to your face .. So don&#x27;t waste it !</li>
    <li> What a difference this product has made in my skin! A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m glad to have discoved it.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product I have ever used.  It says you can use it around your eyes also and OMG the product makes my eyes look instantly less puffy and much brighter.  Everyone has been saying how great I look (no one has told me that in a long time).  I am 53 and I have good skin but this has brought it to the next level.  Please please don&#x27;t ever stop making this.  I will NEVER use anything again.  All you need is this for your entire face (including eyes and neck).  My skin is so soft and not at all greasy.  I cannot say enough good things about this.  I can&#x27;t believe it isn&#x27;t more advertised!!  Guess that&#x27;s how they keep the cost down.</li>
    <li> this cream is lightweight and not greasy at all. Comfortable and easy to wear. Diminishes wrinkles from the first use and improves skin tone and texture almost immediately. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think about it, just buy it! It&#x27;s great product! Unless you have oily and young skin then I don&#x27;t really see the point in purchasing this? I have tried many products in the past, but this, I think is the best for one who has super dry skin. It is very lightweight and absorbs quickly. No icky feeling at all. As for the anti aging benefits - I started to notice an immediate difference with my wrinkles after 3 weeks. Now, this isn&#x27;t botox (or what I would imagine botox to be), but it does the trick for me right now! I will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Product seems to work; it does  not leave skin shiny; and leave skin with smooth clean texture, I am returning a product because of broken pump; I&#x27;ll see how transaction goes</li>
    <li> I have combination skin so I have to be careful what creams I use. I have to say, this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I can feel the difference in my skin after its applied - nice and soft and even better upon waking up. I&#x27;m 50 with combination skin this a must have! I have that 20 something glow again that I thought I had lost forever!</li>
    <li> The tube broke when I opened it, therefore I couldn&#x27;t dispense the cream and it was finished before I knew it. I barely saw any results as well. I would not recommend this product nor would I ever buy it again!</li>
    <li> This product helps improve your skin, nothing harsh just subtle changes that improves your look.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Feels good on your skin. I need to use it for a longer period of time to give a better review.</li>
    <li> Very good, I like it ...</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have been using it once a day for a little over a month with noticeable results, particularly around the mouth and eyes.  Would recommend it to anyone.  Goes on light and the bottle lasts a long while.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this and I still love it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been struggling lately with dryness, dullness, redness and new breakouts - something which I haven&#x27;t dealt with yet. I began using this moisturizer a few days ago and have noticed a significant improvement. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone. I struggle with dry, sensitive skin and have not noticed any negative reaction one week in.</li>
    <li> This cream is very light weight, feels great on your skin and I&#x27;m not sure if its helped my skin look younger but it&#x27;s not greasy at all and works very well under my makeup.  I just wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING. I have very unmanageable combination skin the same time around my t-zone and at times uneven skin complexion - nothing has worked until this. I have been using it for three weeks, my skin finally feels soft, hydrated, and balanced. Fine lines are becoming less visible. I cannot say enough good things about this cream.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels good and smells good. It is light on your skin; not greasy or too heavy. Every woman needs a moisturizer, so make your choice. I have only been using this for about 3 weeks but I am sold.</li>
    <li> Takes off 5 years every time I put it on.</li>
    <li> I have been using the this product morning and night after I cleanse my face. It works as advertised for me, great stuff. This really makes my skin appear years younger after only a short period of time. Within two weeks, I saw visible results in the elasticity of my skin. One thing that is a huge plus for me is that this moisturizer sinks right in to the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. I am going to be using this one for a while. This is a fabulous product!</li>
    <li> I think that I have finally found something that works! Hooray for Vernal. I started using the facial products about 1-1/2 weeks ago and a&lt;br /&gt;cannot believe the change - this comes from a skeptic. Throughout the years I have tried moisturizers and had given up and was just using body lotion. Well, now I have found a product line that does what it is supposed to do...moisturize. I have been using the eye gel and hyaluronic acid serum along with this product once-a-day, after showering each morning and by the following morning my face still fells moist and supple. My skin is sensitive, so I am hesitant to use the micro-abrasion product, so once or twice a week I use a facial cleanser with salt and warm water to &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; clean my face, sometimes following up with Witch Hazel. This regime seems to work for me. I will continue to use the Vernal products and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Unfortunatelly when we received the product, we couldn&#x27;t get the little pump working and it has been like that since. Now I have to &amp;#34;shake&amp;#34; the cream out. For the PRICE I would think that the pump would work so that I don&#x27;t have to use other ways to get the lotion out of the tiny, narrow bottle!</li>
    <li> In return for a review. I paid a discounted price for this product. I received it five days ago. I&#x27;ve been applying it to my face and neck twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer comes in a small bottle with a pump. The directions suggest using a pea-sized application. I needed to use one for my face, and one for my neck.  Already I have been able to cover both areas with just one application.&lt;br /&gt;The skin on my face has been especially dry recently due to 2 different surgeries and a lack of time spent outdoors. This product is actually the only thing that I am using on my face at this time. In just a few days, my skin has lost the dry, crep-y feeling. I&#x27;m looking forward to my skin becoming soft and moist again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Very pleased with this item, it works</li>
    <li> What a massive disappointment. This product does not moisturize. My skin felt drier after I applied it and only got drier as the day wore on. My foundation did not go on smoothly after application. It says the product improves the appearance around the eyes, yet it also says don&#x27;t get the product near or in your eyes. The instructions say if it gets in your eyes to flush them out for 15 minutes. That sound like something you&#x27;d do if you got bleach or lye in your eyes IMO. I wonder if this product has passed or would pass any safety product test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and label looks like something put together in someone&#x27;s garage. I feel totally ripped off.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works well.A must have for any age. Saw improvement after one week. Leaves skin glowing, brighter, and moisturized. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I have used which has absorbed into my skin so well. When i wash in the morning, I don&#x27;t feel greasy from the cream. My face just feels soft and supple. I think the scent is just right- not overwhelming yet refreshing. I look forward to my new night routine because of this product. If you are thinking about trying this, I would give it a shot. Your skin will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have started Vernal skincare products, I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to anything else!</li>
    <li> It smells like mint. It does leave my face looking supple. I have noticed a difference with consistent usage. I would recommend. I will reorder.</li>
    <li> This product have made a huge difference in my skin.My issues are sun damage, dryness especially in winter, redness, and lack of elasticity. This cream have significantly improved my skin in all these areas as well as lessened the appearance of deep wrinkles. Since I started using these products about 2 months ago perfect strangers tell me I have beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a change on my face and pores.  Wasn&#x27;t any different than over the counter creams.  Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase</li>
    <li> THE BEST MOISTURIZER THUS FAR AND IVE TRIED THEM ALL IT GOES REALLY WELL WITH THE WRINKLE  H SERUM I USE BEFOR THEN THE MOISTURIZER  PERFECTO!!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen the lines between eyebrows disappear even after using for 4 months.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a week and a half I am so excited to see the fine lines on my forehead and laugh lines almost disappear. Would greatly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a good face moisturizer that will minimize wrinkles and help with signs of aging that are starting to show up now that I&#x27;m in my 50s. I think my wrinkles are beyond what any product can really *cure* but I have seen much improvement for my cheek area, thin/papery neck. The skin under my neck doesn&#x27;t feel as fragile and tissue papery (not sure if I&#x27;m describing it right) This product has also helped with the bag under eyes since it has really gone down and the little bit of purplish color I have under my eyes has improved. It&#x27;s such a nice texture to apply and it absorbs quickly. My concealer goes on smooth over it as well. I have bought many products and saw no results - from expensive to drugstore, but this one I did. I will continue to use!!</li>
    <li> I have delayed writing my review in order to use the product for a period of time, since they don&#x27;t always work immediately.  This product works fine as a moisturizer.  I felt that it was a bit sticky when applied, and stayed tacky for a while, which I didn&#x27;t care for.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance as far as prevention or improvement of aging.  Overall, I don&#x27;t mind using it, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it for myself, unfortunately.  Again, I think if I were to continue to use this for a few more weeks, I may see more of the benefits listed under the product and may have written a different review.</li>
    <li> This product has put my other skin care products to shame at a fraction of the cost! There was a definite improvement to wrinkles on the thin skin of my chest. I also I use it on my neck and chest area and it has helped ease that &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; look. Excellent line of products.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that this is an ALL-IN-ONE! It doesn&#x27;t bother my eye area - which is extremely sensitive - and I use this with the Vernal Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Skin feels sensational! I&#x27;m HOOKED! And no breakouts - which I&#x27;ve encountered from THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS! Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all. From the Internet &amp;#34;Scams&amp;#34;, to the High End Dept. Stores. Finally found Vernal Skincare - AND I&#x27;VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER WITH A PRODUCT LINE IN MY LIFE! Been using it for about 4 months now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for months. I see a noticeable difference in my appearance. It is a bit expensive, but worth it. It&#x27;s the first cream I&#x27;ve used that has noticeable results. I am 46.</li>
    <li> my rating really should not even be one star - I feel it is false advertising.  As a moisturizer it was creamy and smooth but for getting rid of wrinkles it did not do the job, not even close!  I do NOT want my name used in your posted reviews.</li>
    <li> It smoothes out my skin tone and has a luminous effect to make my skin bright and fresh. My dry skin now feels hydrated and vibrant. I apply this moisturizer after cleansing with the face wash. I will probably use it again. I can recommend it finding good products is not always easy</li>
    <li> I have tried every kind of product there is to try out there. This is the answer to all your worries!! No joke! :) I had fine lines on my forehead and was getting Botox every few months and spending extra money those months. This has now taken the place of Botox! Wow I can&#x27;t even explain how much I love this miracle. My skin is even, soft, and the best it&#x27;s ever looked!!! Their all very good as well and would def recommend them to anyone that&#x27;s contemplating fillers, Botox or anything else. You will change your mind :)</li>
    <li> Used this and XFACIO and didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I like the feel of it on my skin. It has a silkiness to it that glides right on and soaks into your skin instantly. I have noticed a lessening in my deep wrinkles around my eyes, and between my eye brows. The texture of my skin even feels smoother, not so rough a texture. After two weeks of use it my skin feels so smooth and holds the moisture on it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin so I have to be careful what creams I use. I have to say, this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about three weeks and love it. It&#x27;s light weight but substantial enough to moisturize this area thoroughly. I mainly used it at night after washing my face, and it has kept my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritations. As far as the anti-aging properties, I&#x27;ve seen wrinkles around my crease and in between my brows fade dramatically. My skin is overall more balanced now. I recommend trying it only on wrinkles, trouble spots, and the most delicate areas in the morning and at night. Hope everyone gets the same great results I did. Cheers!</li>
    <li> As most people reviewed, and what the seller says it stands to the expectations. My only concern is the cost. 1 bottle per month for $45 is a lil expensive. We have purchased 2 bottles last month teh second bottle has an issue with the pump, 1 quarter of the moisturizer is still in the bottle and refuse to pump out . Im planning on removing the cap and scoop it out with a tooth pick. so giving it 4 stars as I might have a defective bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW many reviewers mentioned that they didnt have a tube inside the bottle, but its the way the bottle is designed. My first bottle worked perfectly without an issue and it didnt have a tube inside. I should have saved the pump from that bottle and used it on my second to solve my issue :)</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It does a great job of tightening your skin! Not a fan of the bottle it&#x27;s in but, I still managed to use all the product. Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Hi! I bought this product line because a good friend of mine saw improvements on his skin. But then again, he never used anything on his skin before! I am always up for anything preventive and can help our aging skin. I have a skin product line I already use but I wanted to try the Vernal line out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have found a neutral effect on my skin with this product - I bought the anti aging moisturizer, repair care eye gel and Hyalruronic acid serum. I applied these on my face 2x a day (am and pm) after thorough face wash. I haven&#x27;t been blown away with this product. It&#x27;s ok, that&#x27;s why I rate it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this product will work for others (like my friend), but it didn&#x27;t help me nor did it make it worse.</li>
    <li> I love Vernal products because they are gentle on my sensitive skin. I own all of their face creams. In my opinion, this is the best formula for everyday use. It provides a perfect amount of moisture and absorbs quickly, without leaving my skin greasy or shiny.</li>
    <li> This hands down is a great all around cream. well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Save your money.  This is just a sweet smelling lotion, and that&#x27;s all.  It will make your skin softer, but there is no miracle here.  ROC products are much less expensive, and they are probably the best on the market.</li>
    <li> As soon as I put it on my face looked 4 times smoother and more radiant. I am glad I gave it a try and saved money in the process. Try it!</li>
    <li> After using it for around two weeks, I saw a great improvement in my skin texture. I think I would continue using this product....</li>
    <li> Used this for 3 days and love it but pump already doesn&#x27;t work. Too expensive to use for only 3 days need to send back for one that works. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My skin has always been very temperamental and over the years I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different moisturizers. . I&#x27;ve heard great things about Vernal, so I decided to give this product a try. I think my search is finally over. The smell is amazing, its light weight, non greasy and it does not make me break out. My fine lines are far less noticeable.My skin texture is sooo silky and much smoother. My skin is actually glowing like it did in my thirties. Even my laugh lines are less noticeable. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have very fair, very sun damaged skin and it helps.  I even think my Old wrinkles have improved.  The only problem is that I may not be able to afford it soon!</li>
    <li> I am a 67 yr old female looking for a good moisturizer. The day I got this product the pump broke that night and I could not even find it in the bottle. There also was no way to return the bottle. I used the product and liked it but I am hesitant buying it again because of the pump issue.</li>
    <li> My first compliment came after using vernal anti aging for 7 days. I am 65, and seeing my face get older is hard to do, any make up appears to just intensify wrinkles and dry areas. My face looks creamy&amp;#34;, said the stranger at the bar, and asked what do I use?  THAT is what I wanted to hear. I can say this product feels refreshing and my face feels smoother. Nothing will make me look like I used to, but being presentable and getting compliments LIKE THAT, makes my day a little better.  p.s. i didn&#x27;t have to use a primer for liquid make up with this product either and it makes my face feel moist but not oily.  I am giving this 4 stars, as I am thinking there will be better results further into using vernal anti aging moisturizer. it has been only 10 days since I received it. also there is no perfume smell!</li>
    <li> My face is not greasy at all, feels softer, and notice some wrinkles less obvious.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  Plus, no breakouts, that&#x27;s always a good thing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now, and it&#x27;s definitely exceeded my expectations! It&#x27;s now a daily essential for me, as my skin looks so much better since I&#x27;ve started using it. It works really well, the texture is not too light, now too heavy, and very smooth. I will keep using it, it&#x27;s really become a staple in my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> had been dying to try this moisturizer since it first came out, but was scared off by the price tag. It seems so little for how much it costs! However, when I finally bit the bullet and bought it, I found out that a little bit goes a long, long way! I just dab a tiny bit on my face, and my skin feels amazingly moisturized! Not tight or dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, so I have a hard time finding the right balance. In the winter I also get these dry spots on my face that look kind of flaky, while other parts are oily. It has been a challenge to find something that works. No more dry spots, or overly oily spots. My face is smooth and soft, and miraculously even. My makeup goes on like a dream!</li>
    <li> Just like many products; you have to wonder about the reviews.  Would not order again.</li>
    <li> I am 54 yrs. old with mature skin and this cream is doing a great job on my skin. It absorbs nicely, gives skin luminosity, and the consistency is substantial. My skin which is naturally dry since I work outside in the elements every day seems to be well-nourished and certainly not as dry. I have tried many products in the past, but this, I think is the best for one who has super dry skin. It has also diminished some fine lines I had around my cheeks and forehead. I will not be without this lovely moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This feel very nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> I had a skincare routine I was happy enough with, and got this as a sample. I noticed an actual difference after one use. I bought one and am half way through, but can honestly say that for my skin, this really is amazing. I had fine lines showing up under my eyes and could never seem to hydrate them enough. This does the trick for me and gives an overall firmness that I thought was lost to time.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference in appearance and feels like very thin glue</li>
    <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t live without this moisturizer! I am well over 60 and look much younger. It doesn&#x27;t absorb to the point where my skin feels dry, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin shiny, either. I live in a dry climate, so this may be too fluid for someone in a humid zone. All in all, the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I LOVE Vernal products and use many of them.</li>
    <li> This is a very good anti aging moisturizer cream. Other creams are slimy or smell bad when applied to the skin. This one is not like those at all. I will be sure to buy these again for myself and others as these would make a great gift at Christmas!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels wonderful! Not too thick but not too light. Love how it makes my face feel. I&#x27;ve used Youth Surge for a while and loved it but this one is even better! My skin is super soft, smoother and hydrated. I also noticed that my skin is more clear, glowing, and has diminished redness, I use this day and night. I will say that I would like a bigger jar at a better value. I love this stuff. I highly recommend.I will continue to use this since I am having great results.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is abnormally dry. I used to have to apply face lotion three times a day - not anymore!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it on the bags under my eyes now for 4 weeks and no change -I&#x27;ll update after three months but not seeing any improvement 😰&lt;br /&gt;And I get plenty of sleep!</li>
    <li> I been using this moisturizer for two weeks. Got it as a sample with another purchase. I find it super hydrating, non greasy. Leaves my skin super soft and glowing! I use this as a follow up to my NUDE face wash- the best combo! I&#x27;ve received ton&#x27;s of compliments from you looked totally rested to your skin is radiant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every single product that Vernal has made! I normally use the HA serum, but now I use this at night! My skin is very dry but this has changed that and my face is now never dry, period! I&#x27;m not sure how Vernal keeps on putting out such great products, but they don&#x27;t disappoint! This made my skin different from the first use and it just keeps getting better with time. This will change the texture and softness of your skin, this also goes great with there new serum! Around my eyes has always been dry even with eye cream, but no longer! Thanks Vernal! Perfect once again!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!  Leaves a very smooth feel all day long.  I use it with Vernal serum.  I can really see a difference - my face looks lifted and brighter!</li>
    <li> I am not happy at all with the Vernal cream or Vernal eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;It does not penetrate the skin and see no difference in skin.&lt;br /&gt;Would like to return for a refund.</li>
    <li> Usually, I don&#x27;t mess around with &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; products, because a lot of them do-not work, but, since this was only $44, I decided to just do it. I am quite glad I did, for the results I got, I could have spent $200 elsewhere. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my mother by way of a discount and she loves it! Says it is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> Vernal anti-aging moisturizer cream makes my beauty routine so much more streamlined!  It works hard to de-puff, moisturize and helps keep my face feeling fresh all day.  The ingredients in the cream are anti-aging and are proven to help to fend off fine lines and wrinkles.  I have tried many different anti-aging serums and this one is by far the best I have found.  I have only been using it a short time and have already noticed a lot of my fine lines have become less noticeable.  Many of my friends and co-workers have also commented on how fresh my skin looks and have asked if I had botox.  Vernal Anti-aging Moisturizer Cream is definitely a game changer that will not disappoint!</li>
    <li> This is definitely my new favorite moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks, and even after the first few days&#x27; use, I noticed that it was really toning down the redness in my face! I am so grateful to this moisturizer. It absorbs super quickly and leaves my skin very soft and supple without any grease.</li>
    <li> I have once tried this and this is my second bottle but second one i got for free which is really awesome. This product is really moiturizing and super hydrating. It also brighten my complexion a bit. My skin feels smooth and soft. Love this product and will keep repurchasing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a moisturizer with the right consistency for a while now. Some of the other creams on the market are thick and irritate my skin. This Vernal moisturizer is light yet it hydrates my skin beautifully with no adverse reaction. It has a pleasant scent that I really enjoy. Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I have been on the looking for a good moisturizer for some time -- so excited to have found this! The moisturizer goes on beautifully smooth and has a fantastic light scent. My skin feels hydrated and soft. Perfect price point and perfect for winter skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! And soooo recommend it! I have been using it under my eyes primarily due to really bad bags in that area and it has been like magic in a bottle. Huge difference. Nice minty feel to it and so worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a scam product</li>
    <li> Im sure this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your hard earned money.  See a certified dermatologist and check the new obagi products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 and have tried several products that address aging skin issues. This is my favorite so far. I use it twice a day, and after applying, my skin feels firmer and toned and looks younger and refreshed. I really love it. Has a nice light feel and scent. I don&#x27;t know if it has actually &amp;#34;permanently changed&amp;#34; my lines as the ad copy claims, but I look forward to using it. It makes me feel prettier and that might be worth it right there. People have complimented me on my appearance recently. Is this because of the cream? Have no idea but I do like it well enough to keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer since it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily and sticky.  I use right after I put on some anti-wrinkle cream and I love how it makes my face and skin feeling so soft and healthy.  There&#x27;s a bit of shine that I see on my skin after the moisturizer dries out, but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over three weeks and I am very pleased with the results. My skin feels very smooth and silky and fine lines have almost disappeared and wrinkles have smoothed. It is smooth &amp; glides right onto the skin! Absorbs quickly! My skin is soft and a lot firmer! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works great!  I love it!  I am ordering another one today.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know I just started using the product</li>
    <li> I have fine lines underneath my eyes and few wrinkle on my forehead and around my eyes. All these makes me look way older than my age. I really wanted to get rid of these fine lines which get more prominent when I apply makeup. I am using this anti aging moisturizer cream  over 10 days now and it started showing the result. My fine lines are fading away. My skin is more firm and youthful. My hubby has noticed the change in my skin. I am so glad this Anti aging cream is working so well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it in the morning just a bit of it because a little goes long way. It keeps my skin moisturize whole day.&lt;br /&gt;This Anti aging Moisturizer cream has Vitamin C which improves the skin texture. It Increases the skin tone and elasticity within few weeks. I am impressed with this product. I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this Anti Aging Moisturizer cream in exchange of an unbiased opinion however it did not affect my thought about it.</li>
    <li> This product works while you wear it, but I did not see long term results. And in the meantime, they contacted me several times about feedback. If they were confident in their product maybe they wouldn&#x27;t be so dependent upon the reviews. I found it annoying since I had responded once and told them that I would write a review when I had enough time to experience the product.</li>
    <li> I have received this product without charge or at discounted price to give my honest opinion on it these that are expressed are my own. My mom loves this and how it makes her skin feel!! She puts on morning and night and hasn&#x27;t said one bad thing about it!!</li>
    <li> I love vitamin c serums. I usually use the body shop vitamin c serum, but I was looking for a cream once I discovered they use parabens and some other questionable ingredients. I love the ingredients Vernal uses. It goes on so smooth and dries nicely. I can tell a huge difference after only using it a few weeks! It had a nice consistency so it really easy to apply. I did receive a discount when I bought it.</li>
    <li> I love using Vernal Anti Aging Cream! It goes on so easy, makes your skin feel tight and firm, but yet feel soft too. I have only been using it a couple of months, but do see some improvement in reducing the appearance of wrinkles. I also put a drop on my hands, mixed with my Aveda hand cream, to make my aging skin look better there too.</li>
    <li> Wife only just started to use so not enough time  to tell yet.she&#x27;s very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know for sure.  But it feels good going on.  Sort of tingly, which I like.</li>
    <li> The product works great.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I have received many compliments about my skin. A little expensive but worth a try if anyone is looking for a facial improvement.</li>
    <li> This took a while to show improvement, but I believe it has helped with lines around my mouth and eyes.  I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It is a lotion but after reading the reviews I thought I would try it cause they sounded good.  I am not sure I really see any difference and for the price I do not thing I would repurchase it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year, and it&#x27;s amazing. I love that it&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly. My skin has NEVER looked this good! I had fine lines showing up around my T-zone and could never seem to hydrate them enough. This does the trick for me and gives an overall firmness that I thought was lost to time. Daily usage of this has slowed down signs aging for me. This is the second product I have from this line and I&#x27;m happy so far with both. highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have never experienced such an amazing product. I have notice that the redness in my face a diminished and not a blemish in site. This moisturizer has changed my skin for the better. Hands down this is the best moisturizer I have ever used! The smell is wonderful, like mint and a very soft scent!</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel softer after about a week of use I could see a big difference in my skin.  I would recommeded this to everyone!  so worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I use it religiously, every day and every night. Very nice results. I got this as a sample &amp; thought it would be greasy but it wasn&#x27;t. It absorbs right into the skin &amp; leaves no residue. I love this stuff &amp; will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Still using it....Not sure much of a change!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. My skin soaks it up and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily. I have seen an improvement in my skin over the past month. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used and trust me, I&#x27;ve used plenty.  My skin is more lifted, brighter and tighter. I&#x27;ve finally stopped trying just about every moisturizer on the market since I&#x27;ve been using Vernal.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the Vernal eye cream, so was looking forward to trying the moisturizer.  I&#x27;m not as pleased.  It&#x27;s fine, but I definitely don&#x27;t see the great results that I do with the eye cream.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! My 55 year old face absorbs it very quickly and the results are amazing! I am a product junkie and have tried the best. The results from this very reasonably priced product are far better than those costing hundreds of dollars. I live in Florida and my skin is normal to slightly dry with not many wrinkles but starting to age more and this product has really made my skin glow and has improved the texture and tone. I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Very helpful serum. I can see the results of tighter skin already. Great product</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t yet noticed any improvements in my skin (e.g. in brown spots, laugh lines, wrinkles or texture) but I do like how this cream feels &amp; goes on &amp; that it has no or only a faint smell.  Its high price level made me decide to at the same time also buy the refund-guaranteed &amp;#34;Resurrect Anti-Aging Moisturizer&amp;#34; by Indefinite Beauty which costs 16% less &amp; is also highly rated so I could compare the 2 products.  As I liked them both equally, I last night decided to compare their ingredients &amp; was shocked to find their ingredient list is identical which likely explains why their dispensers are also identical except for the label &amp; name on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVEN AT THE LOWER PRICE OF $36.95 FOR ITS SEEMINGLY IDENTICAL ALTERNATIVE by Indefinite Beauty, I&#x27;M NOT YET SURE IT&#x27;S WORTH EVEN THAT COST LEVEL UNLESS I START SEEING SOME NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENTS SOON but I will give the cheaper product a try for longer to make sure I gave it a fair chance before switching to other alternatives.  However, I wanted to without delay alert other potential buyers that they can get what looks like the identical product in every way for 16% less cost.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 months and not only do I notice a visual difference when I run out of it, but 6 weeks after I started using it people were asking me if I had work done. Pricey but WORTH IT. I am 34 and have dry skin.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this cream for me because he knows I am always looking for something to tackle my wrinkles.  I only started using this cream a week or so ago, and have not noticed the wrinkles looking less noticeable, but the skin on my face looks healthier and it glows.  Also, I love the way it feels on my skin and you just need to use a little dot.  I moisturize my face first thing in the morning and then I work out at the gym every day for a couple of hours.  When I take my shower at night and wash my face, it is still moist from this cream.  I can feel it as I am washing it off.  So, whether it does anything to my wrinkles (I am  58), it doesn&#x27;t matter.  It feels great and I don&#x27;t need much on my face and it lasts throughout the day.  PLUS I&#x27;m glowing.</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERYTHING out there for dry skin, high end to low end. This is the holy grail. It absorbs quickly, but deeply and is nourishing and intensive. I will never go back to another moisturizer again. I&#x27;m sold. Thank you so much for offering this. Now if you could just get it into all the stores!!</li>
    <li> I would give it less than one star if it was possible.  I feel like I received something different from those raving about this product.  This made my skin drier and look older.</li>
    <li> I’m happy with my purchase of this face cream. It has helped my skin look flawless. I’ve been told that my pores look smaller and my skin looks youthful. I have noticed that my skin never feels sticky after applying this cream which is great because the other cream I’ve tried in the past never felt like they truly absorbed. I will for sure be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is awful for me.I want to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Anzhela.</li>
    <li> This product is OK. I guess it depends on the condition of your skin but I personally have dry skin (thanks to the winter) and this product made it worse.  I tried it for a month to see it my skin needed to adjust and nope...small pieces of skin began to flake off.  I stopped using it and regret purchasing.</li>
    <li> Really small bottle....worked ok.  I will try something else next time.  No magic.</li>
    <li> Terrific cream! I have tried several other Vernal products and love the quality and results so when I purchased this product I was not disappointed. Has become my new favorite cream and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Only used it a couple times so far niceeeee!!! I have several jars of very pricey creams and they work but not as fast and as I seem to notice this. I will post up-date later on oh and fast delivery that is a major plus for me.</li>
    <li> Bought it on a whim through their website a few months ago, been using it every day non stop for close to three weeks now and I&#x27;ve seen remarkable changes my fine lines. This cream provides great hydration as well - the tube is small enough to travel with which is a plus for me. Highly recommend this product. This is the second product from this skincare l use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. But thought it would do more than it does. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am 53 and have been alternating between Obaji  and Skin Medica  for 3 years now.&lt;br /&gt;I was so tired of spending so much money on myself! Yes I liked the products and would recommend Only if they tried Vernal first.&lt;br /&gt;The reason being, after 6 months of using Vernal Anti Aging Moisturizer I truly saw a difference without breaking the bank! In fact, I went in to have a touch up of Botox from my dermatologist and she said that my skin was beautiful, flawless! I did not tell her that I was no longer using Obagi that she had me using.&lt;br /&gt;I have started using it on my neck and chest, I hope to have the same fantastic results that I have for my faces.&lt;br /&gt;I have now ordered the whole line of Vernal and am so excited to get it!</li>
    <li> I am a Aesthetic RN...I have tried many many creams for myself and for my clients.  i am 55 years old. I have to say this is the BEST cream I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels soft as a childs, firm as it was in my 30&#x27;s, my pores are minimized and it looks more even toned.  What more can you ask for right??&lt;br /&gt;Within a week all of this occurred.  I now am thinking I should order it by the case for my whole body!!&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed Vernal Skincare!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth. The shipping was quick and packaging was professional.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard that this was an amazing moisturizer, and BOY were they right!! My skin is not super dry, however, this winter I experienced drier skin than in the past. This moisturizer was really wonderful. My skin is in LOVE with this cream! I will continue to purchase this product!!!</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have noticed the signs of aging. I have fine lines and wrinkles on my forehead and under eye area. I have acne scars and melasma. I&#x27;ve tried every gimmick and cream out there and nothing has really worked to diminish the look of any of these problems. I jumped at the chance to get a complimentary bottle of this Vernal Anti Aging Moisturizing Cream and be able to share my honest and unbiased opinion with it here with you. My skin is oily and acne prone so I have to be careful with what I use on my face to decrease break outs. So far this product has not caused any break out areas. I use this product after I wash my face with my regular cleansing foam. What I like about the bottle itself is that it looks really luxurious like you spent a fortune on the product and that it has a pump! The cream itself is really creamy and has a minty type of scent to it. It is very calming in a way, just the smell of it. I rub this all over my face and it rubs in really good leaving my skin feeling fresh. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 days and it might just be my imagination but I have a dark spot on my upper lip that hasn&#x27;t diminished in months and to me it seems like it has faded a little after using this product. Which brings me to another pro, with this product you really don&#x27;t need to use any others as it works to not only moisturize your face but it works to diminish fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots, brighten your skin and reduce dark spots and puffiness around your eyes, basically its an all in one product! Overall I think that this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Had to use my other moisturizer, this didn&#x27;t moisturize at all. Awful!!</li>
    <li> Vernal is a great skinline! Have the moisturizer and wrinkle serum! Love both!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45 and have been using the Equate (Walmart) version of the Olay micro sculpting cream for years and am quite happy with it, but these reviews stating this cream helped plump deep set eyebrow creases, minimize under eye bags, shrink pores and clear chin acne had me wanting to spend the money and give it a try. It&#x27;s been three weeks and this product hasn&#x27;t helped any of these things. Also, it&#x27;s not near as hydrating as what I use, nor is the scent as pleasant. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 46 yrs old and have tried most moisturizers out there and have spent up to $80 for a small jar or bottle.  I thought I would give this one a try since it had such great reviews and is a little less expensive.  Wasn&#x27;t impressed out of the gate- it has an odd smell, and I felt like it goes on slightly tacky/sticky.  Also, I don&#x27;t know if I can say &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;, because for full facial coverage I need to use about 4-5 small dabs of it.  However, I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I definitely see an improvement in my skin!  It has helped with clarity, moisture, and it also plumps and firms, and gives me a nice glow....without causing breakouts which many creams do to me.  It is not often that I buy a second bottle of moisturizer- I usually go on to try the next best thing hoping its better.  The only other brand I have bought more than once is Clinique&#x27;s laser focus serum.  But at 1/2 the price,  I will definitely buy Vernal again.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it some time and didn&#x27;t go with my initial impression.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I got this cream for my wife.She said this cream is amazing.She is 40 and  she used Elizabeth Arden for years.When  she  seen so many positive reviews.She thought she would  give a try and she is glad she did.This cream reduce wrinkles and leaves a glow.This cream really works .I will definitely purchase more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Vernal</li>
