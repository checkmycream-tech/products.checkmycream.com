      <li>Very happy with my purchase.</li>

      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It was sent very promptly and perfect condition!</li>
      <li>It is strong however it is a good price for the strength when comparing to Renova or Refissa..</li>
      <li>Product is very strong, have been using retinol .5for</li>
      <li>It might be a very good product and I might have applied too much</li>
      <li>I am 45 years old and have used many products containing Retinol and this is the best one yet.</li>
      <li>The price is too good to be true.</li>
      <li>It is a great alternative to pure retin a.</li>
      <li>Save yourself the headache and buy from a store or reputable seller.</li>
      <li>Amazon price so much better.</li>
      <li>I am not saying that I look 20, I&#x27;m saying the condition of my skin is better than it has ever been.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did not give up on this cream and finished the bottle</li>
      <li>, I have no reason to doubt that this is an authentic product.</li>
      <li>like it better</li>
      <li>This site was very informative and the product was as described - great ebayer!!&lt;br /&gt;A+++</li>
      <li>This product is ok, but I already use a retinol called tretinoin and this does not compare to it.</li>
      <li>so I can look better twenty years from now.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product as it really does work and is a great price.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product many, many times.  </li>
      <li>However, I am completely pleased with results of SkinMedica after about 3 weeks of use.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>If like me you have used retinol products before and have gradually gotten to the higher strengths, this is a good product for you and will save you money.</li>
      <li>I have used many  products &amp; none of them have been really great, but Skin Medica has far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>It does cause some peeling but so far it is a great deal.</li>
      <li>It may be fine for some but too strong for me.  </li>
      <li>It is very strong so be sure to use it very sparingly.</li>
      <li>A total of 1.10% retinoids is an impressive concentration of Vit A. I have to say that this stuff is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>Great company thanks very much.  </li>
      <li>My skin texture has improved, fine lines gone.</li>
      <li>Very effective retinol product that leaves your skin looking new and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I work out alot to keep fit now</li>
      <li>so I also use a light cream during the day.</li>
      <li>I just wish Amazon had this product available under Prime for faster shipping.    </li>
      <li>Light degrades retinol so to avoid wasting your money, don&#x27;t try to use during the day.  </li>
      <li>I originally read reviews on this product that it \\</li>
      <li>I bought my original bottle of this at my dermatologist&#x27;s office for $75.</li>
      <li>The fading is commensurate with the original color.  </li>
      <li>The results from Skinmedica products are phenomenal , would recommend their whole skin brightening line to women of all ages.</li>
      <li>it is full.</li>
      <li>My first purchase of retinol was fine.  </li>
      <li>You will also notice that very fine lines almost disappear and that those with a little more presence diminish to the fine line category.  </li>
      <li>This is hands down the best treatment I&#x27;ve tried to treat adult acne - also reduces the appearance of scars.</li>
      <li>He has been using this cream for two weeks now and he could not believe how fast it started fading his scars and plumped up his fine lines.  </li>
      <li>It contains 1.10% total retinoids, and does a great job of keeping my post-facelift skin soft and wrinkle-free!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that this serum works - it lightens dark spots, evens out skin tone, plumps up skin by replenishing collagen levels and makes skin look younger and more</li>
      <li>If you are sensitive to strong retinols, use graduaally.</li>
      <li>This product really made a difference in my skin!</li>
      <li>Love this product and buy it all the time, especially with some of the products recommended to use with it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products, but this one actually made a difference.</li>
      <li>Yes, at first it will burn and it will feel like your skin is on fire</li>
      <li>I suggest when you receive the product, you open it up and make sure there</li>
      <li>The pump gives you exactly the recommended amount to use per night time.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s only getting better.  </li>
      <li>When purchasing beauty products make sure your actually getting &amp; paying for what&#x27;s being advertised.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two years, got the first bottle from the aesthetitian at the dermatologist where i was peeling.</li>
      <li>If you are new to retinol, you will notice mild redness and flaking.</li>
      <li>It works better on my fine lines than much more expensive products.</li>
      <li>I believe some vendors on Amazaon are taking advantage of the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t buy big-ticket skin products but make an exception for this product as it is far superior to any other non-prescription skin-care product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>In 2011 when I first purchased this product it was definitely the genuine thing.</li>
      <li>There are rare moments after bravely exfoliating the dead skin that it looks decent, but it&#x27;s short lived.</li>
      <li>i spoke to Nadia which is very nice and promised to take care of the problem right away and send me a different product that i have used in the past</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t create the redness that straight retin a creates.  </li>
      <li>A bit pricey, but I have not broken out with this gel either.  </li>
      <li>I have used a number of others from drugstore chains and department stores but this product really outperforms them all.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>works very well.</li>
      <li>It firmed up the lines around my eyes and made my dingy skin much clearer.</li>
      <li>After one week of starting the Retinol again it looked fantastic.</li>
      <li>Thought this would be a cheaper alternative, but it was too much for my skin.</li>
      <li>Again, this one was the real stuff.</li>
      <li>If you have deep wrinkles, sagging skins, or significant sun damage, this product won&#x27;t offer the benefits you seek.</li>
      <li>This product has faded it more than any other product over the counter.  </li>
      <li>I have a small bit of very light caramel colored melasma from BCPs on my right cheek.  </li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s face it, older skin is older skin.</li>
      <li>I may have to give up and find another anti-aging strategy that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have a highly contagious illness.</li>
      <li>but it does not mean no irritation.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought the product labeled, \\&quot;SkinMedica Tri-retinol Complex Es, 1-ounce\\&quot;.  Turns out, it&#x27;s the normal tri-retinol, not the ES. False advertising &amp; unethical.</li>
    <li> Product is very strong, have been using retinol .5for at least a year and it truly peeled my skin off. Took about 5 days for it to heal. Will stick with .5 retinol</li>
    <li> I think it does what it claims. It has reduced my wrinkles and is eliminating hyperpigmentation. It gives me less irritation to my skin but it does not mean no irritation.</li>
    <li> i bought the redness relief complex because it was recommended for my rosacea and it made it so much worse  just awful  the worse of it is that i mailed the product 3/4 full to SKINMEDICA in NY and the customer service is horrendous-i didn&#x27;t ask for a refund- i simply asked for another product which i have used before or just any moisturizer-not much to ask, considering i could sue them for how much worse my face is now because of the product  i spoke to Nadia which is very nice and promised to take care of the problem right away and send me a different product that i have used in the past but then i got several calls from a Muriel that refuses to handle this matter in a proper way  So, not only am i out 75 dollrs, i&#x27;m also out the shipping costs etc  AWFUL and disconcerting AWFUL customer service  I DO NOT RECOMMEND OR ENDORSE THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY-</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, quick service!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent company with great products, this is by far my favorite and I like it better then Retin A. It is a strong exfoliates which makes your skin look like new, and the price is half that do the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful who you purchase this product from. This seller has the \\&quot;real\\&quot; thing, while another couple all conterfeits with fake tops. I suggest when you receive the product, you open it up and make sure there it is full. There are fakes out there with no tube, so they tell you you have to turn the product over and hit the bottom of the jar...really?? For $150 I need to force the product out?!? I don&#x27;t think so...those are fakes. Again, this one was the real stuff. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I never leave a review for beauty creams because they never do what they advertise.....I change my my mind because this hands down works and I myself could not believe the results!!! I&#x27;ve been using this cream for six weeks now and I look like a different person. My skin is so soft and younger looking. I will be 41 next month and I look like I am 31. I am so happy with my results that I will not stop using this product. I cannot believe I finally found a product that does exactly what it describes. Yes, at first it will burn and it will feel like your skin is on fire but it will go away as your skin grows use to it. I am use to the burn because I&#x27;ve used 10% glycolic acid and that stuff gives your skin no mercy.    I am so glad I did not give up on this cream and finished the bottle now I&#x27;m on my second order. I work out alot to keep fit now I feel and look younger from head to toe. I wash my face twice a day evening and morning also exfoliate twice a week to speed up the process which helps remove the dead skin. No more hyperpigmentation, frown lines are gone, my face has plump up. I put this on every night before I go to bed and can&#x27;t wait to run to the mirror and look at my face in the morning. I just stand there in the mirror with a big smile on my face....and say to myself, \\&quot;unbelieveable\\&quot;. Also it will dry your face out alot so I also use a light cream during the day. All I can say is I found a product that actually works for me.    Update:Feburary 18, 2012    I purchased a bottle for my husband after he saw my results and he never puts creams on his face he wanted to get rid of the hyperpigmention he received from shaving.  He has been using this cream for two weeks now and he could not believe how fast it started fading his scars and plumped up his fine lines.  He has been using it evey night before bed and even he has stated how refreshed he looks.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and it&#x27;s only getting better.  This is now my husbands and my permenant cream. I just wish Amazon had this product available under Prime for faster shipping.    Update:November 5, 2014    FYI:  I no longer purchase this product from Amazon due to last 3 bottles were not the real thing.  I only purchase this product directly from SkinMedica which sales the 1.0 percent cream which is the highest version according to the manufactures website. SkinMedica no longer has the Tri-retinol Complex Es available on their website. When purchasing beauty products make sure your actually getting &amp; paying for what&#x27;s being advertised. In 2011 when I first purchased this product it was definitely the genuine thing. I believe some vendors on Amazaon are taking advantage of the positive reviews. The manufactor website quotes \\&quot;We cannot guarantee the product quality or authenticity of products purchased through any other outlet.\\&quot; Hope this update helps.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I had plastic surgery and couldn&#x27;t wash my face for a week or so, and it looked a wreck. After one week of starting the Retinol again it looked fantastic. It firmed up the lines around my eyes and made my dingy skin much clearer. I&#x27;ve used a lot of products over the years, and this is as close to the Fountain of Youth as I&#x27;ve come.</li>
    <li> The results from Skinmedica products are phenomenal , would recommend their whole skin brightening line to women of all ages.</li>
    <li> Got this cream for my mom. initially she said her skin was peeling, however, she continues to use it on a regular basis and says that her skin has improved.</li>
    <li> The product caused my skin to burn, peel, itch, swell, and turn red, about 3 days after using it. Took me awhile to figure out what was causing this, because of the delayed reaction. Took almost a week to heal. Very odd, since I&#x27;ve slathered on prescription strength retinol before and never had a problem. (except the expense!) Thought this would be a cheaper alternative, but it was too much for my skin. (And I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin) Can&#x27;t tell you if it works because I obviously had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to take the time to write a review because this is an awesome product that works.  It is strong however it is a good price for the strength when comparing to Renova or Refissa..If you are sensitive to strong retinols, use graduaally. If like me you have used retinol products before and have gradually gotten to the higher strengths, this is a good product for you and will save you money. The pump gives you exactly the recommended amount to use per night time. This goes on and sinks in and is not only not greasy but it sort of gives a drying affect which for me is perfect since I am acne prone.  Since this product is not greasy it has cleared up blackheads around my nose. I did experience some peeling but no reddness.  I would recommend this product as it really does work and is a great price.  My dermatologist recommended this product to me and even sells this in their offices.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best treatment I&#x27;ve tried to treat adult acne - also reduces the appearance of scars.</li>
    <li> I had trouble tolerating tretinoin and my esthetician recommended this product. No matter what I do--moisturizer before, using less of the product, using every 3rd or 4th day--my face is a peeling, irritated, dried out mess. There are rare moments after bravely exfoliating the dead skin that it looks decent, but it&#x27;s short lived. And this is after 6 months of use. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it to look this bad in my forties so I can look better twenty years from now. I may have to give up and find another anti-aging strategy that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have a highly contagious illness.</li>
    <li> I originally read reviews on this product that it \\&quot; peeled my skin off\\&quot; as one individual worded it. This product is ok, but I already use a retinol called tretinoin and this does not compare to it. But if if you are not already using a retinol  this would be wonderful..probably</li>
    <li> This product has helped my skin stay healthy, by exfoliating without the excessive dryness. I have recommended to my family members.</li>
    <li> This person is not selling what is advertised. The price is too good to be true. I opened my supposedly &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; box and found the regular Tri-retinol Complex bottle inside, which is a considerably cheaper product than the ES. I am attempting to return this item, but it cannot be returned through Amazon&#x27;s regular return method - we will see what happens. Save yourself the headache and buy from a store or reputable seller.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time, all the way from America.  Great company thanks very much.  Will definitely use again and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does cause some peeling but so far it is a great deal. I have used it for about a year and the results are great.</li>
    <li> Definitly stronger than the regular tri-ret complex.  I can only use it once a week still, and then use the regular complex the rest of the days.  I&#x27;m hopeing to slowly work in to this one, as I think I have topped out my results with the regular complex.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen tighter and smoother skin. It is drying so use moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for two years, got the first bottle from the aesthetitian at the dermatologist where i was peeling. Amazon price so much better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have been using 7 months with wonderful results.  Most of my dark spots have faded and wrinkles do not seem as deep as they were.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  Fast shipping. Will buy again.  This cream is the only thing that has worked on my skin</li>
    <li> Item arrived in timely manner and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> recommended by my dermatologist. works very well. did not dry out my skin. I use it every other day followed by a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My first purchase of retinol was fine.  The second retinol I bought was retinol es - after using it for a week my face started burning and became red.  I stopped using it but three days later, my face still has burn spots.  It may be fine for some but too strong for me.  I am going back to regular retinol once my face clears up.</li>
    <li> I consider this a MUST for skin care. I am 45 years old and have used many products containing Retinol and this is the best one yet. The \\&quot;ES\\&quot; complex is the stronger strength and there is no tingling or burning and the results are fantastic. In the past year since I started using this product, I no longer wear foundation. My skin tone and complexion look healthier than in my 20\\&quot;s. I am not saying that I look 20, I&#x27;m saying the condition of my skin is better than it has ever been. I do use other SkinMedica products but if I could only afford one, this would be it. It is best to use as a night treatment but I have used it day and night when I have had a rare blemish and it helped to shorten the duration of those annoying little problems.</li>
    <li> Skin medica tri retinol e.s. is a skin care must for everyone&#x27;s age/ beauty routine. Very effective retinol product that leaves your skin looking new and fresh.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and very satisfied with the results.  Amazon&#x27;s pricing is great.</li>
    <li> A total of 1.10% retinoids is an impressive concentration of Vit A. I have to say that this stuff is pretty strong. If you are new to retinol, I suggest you ease into a slow, gradual regime with this, probably every third day initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that this serum works - it lightens dark spots, evens out skin tone, plumps up skin by replenishing collagen levels and makes skin look younger and more alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have no reason to doubt that this is an authentic product. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used many  products &amp; none of them have been really great, but Skin Medica has far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Love these products</li>
    <li> This product really made a difference in my skin! I&#x27;ve tried many products, but this one actually made a difference. Used it as directed so had no problems with redness. Now I use it 5 out of 7 nights at bedtime and I love it! My skin texture has improved, fine lines gone. It&#x27;s great! Let&#x27;s face it, older skin is older skin. Nothing is going to make me (63) look 25 again. However, I am completely pleased with results of SkinMedica after about 3 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I am a 43 year old Caucasian.  Light but not fair skin.  No skin conditions of note.  Non-smoker.  Not a sun worshiper.  I have been very happy with this Tri-retinol product.  I have used a number of others from drugstore chains and department stores but this product really outperforms them all.  I use it before bed after cleansing my face with a non-soap product.  Light degrades retinol so to avoid wasting your money, don&#x27;t try to use during the day.  If you are new to retinol, you will notice mild redness and flaking. Over about a month or two (not much sooner), you will begin to notice fading of dark spots.  They will not disappear, they will fade.  The lighter they are to begin with the lighter they will be.  They will not all fade to the same lightness.  The fading is commensurate with the original color.  You will also notice that very fine lines almost disappear and that those with a little more presence diminish to the fine line category.  I have a small bit of very light caramel colored melasma from BCPs on my right cheek.  This product has faded it more than any other product over the counter.  It is not gone, but it is much less noticeable. If you have deep wrinkles, sagging skins, or significant sun damage, this product won&#x27;t offer the benefits you seek.</li>
    <li> It is a great alternative to pure retin a. It doesn&#x27;t create the redness that straight retin a creates.  Like a lot!!</li>
    <li> Love this product and buy it all the time, especially with some of the products recommended to use with it.  I don&#x27;t buy big-ticket skin products but make an exception for this product as it is far superior to any other non-prescription skin-care product I&#x27;ve tried.  Gotta be careful with it, though, since it acts on my skin just exactly like Retin A does.  It can leave your skin raw and you need to work your way up to it.  Use it every 3 days, then 2 days, etc.</li>
    <li> It is very strong so be sure to use it very sparingly. I developed a rash and my skin started to&lt;br /&gt;burn and peel. It might be a very good product and I might have applied too much but it is not&lt;br /&gt;for sensitive or older skin.</li>
    <li> I think that the experience was great! This site was very informative and the product was as described - great ebayer!!&lt;br /&gt;A+++</li>
    <li> I bought my original bottle of this at my dermatologist&#x27;s office for $75. When i ordered this I compared the bottles and they were exactly the same, right down to the color and consistency of the cream inside. Too soo to tell if it words the same.</li>
    <li> This stuff may be expensive, but it is worth it. It works better on my fine lines than much more expensive products. I recommend it to you!</li>
    <li> I have used this product many, many times.  A bit pricey, but I have not broken out with this gel either.  A very good product.</li>
    <li> I ordered and paid for the ES version of the Tri-retinol.  However, what I received was just the \\&quot;Complex\\&quot; without the ES.  I have noticed no changes after a month of use.  Wondering if the ES would make a difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This was purchased from Livewater.  I note that there are several different vendors selling the Tri-Retinol. At least one other person complained about the same problem, but didn&#x27;t say who the vendor was.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  It contains 1.10% total retinoids, and does a great job of keeping my post-facelift skin soft and wrinkle-free!  The price I paid from Amazon was great!  It was sent very promptly and perfect condition!</li>
