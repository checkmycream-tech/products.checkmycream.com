      <li>It is a really nice product that blends well, causes no irritation, and provides great coverage.  </li>
      <li>Good coverage,</li>

      <li>I bought this, thinking it would be good makeup, and then kept it to use as a sunscreen.</li>

      <li>Light/Medium is a good match for me</li>
      <li>Nice feel, great coverage</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and I love it!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS MAKEUP!</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>Does not look nice on the skin, settles into pores and creases around nose.</li>
      <li>Nice consistency.</li>
      <li>Honestly, it goes on just like a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; foundation in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I think it is very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I am fair (always one of the lightest colors available in foundation/concealer) and this works on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Used it for the first time today and after wearing it for 8 hours it still looks great</li>
      <li>Great product, highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really happy that I&#x27;ve found quick and easy makeup that stays on all day in this 100</li>
      <li>but it feels very light on your skin and blends</li>
      <li>Best of all, it is not too dark for my fair skin.</li>
      <li>I love this CC cream: the formula is very light and not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Would like a bit more color and stay power but would buy again.  </li>
      <li>But the tinted moisturizer has more color options, which I am hopeful they will someday add to this product.  </li>
      <li>Most things either break me out or burn my skin.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product!</li>
      <li>the color looked more and more orange on me.</li>
      <li>The coverage is lighter, but it matches my skin tone better.</li>
      <li>(I wish Physicians Formula made this in more shades for everyone.)</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not horrible.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this foundation.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
      <li>there are no nasty ingredients in it.  </li>
      <li>This is a product I absolutely love.  </li>
      <li>Hope this is helpful to someone. :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE that it&#x27;s not greasy or oily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a matte finish.</li>
      <li>Will not be able to use this product.</li>
      <li>Purchased with the intent of switching over to more healthy makeup products.</li>
      <li>This CC Cream matches my skin tone pretty well, and the coverage is good (I would say medium).</li>
      <li>It does not sit in fine lines or wrinkles and does not sit on top of my skin.</li>
      <li>This is a great natural foundation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s 100% natural.</li>
      <li>If you do not mind kind of the odd but not to strong smell, it is a very good makeup.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a little more coverage than a tinted moisturizer, and this was perfect!</li>
      <li>and this is one makeup product clearly labeled gluten free which is great.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply</li>
      <li>but it comes out too pinkish and warm for my skin tone (I&#x27;m fair with yellow under tones).</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell that I can tell.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t always have to wear it with a powder or another product, but also equally works great with those other products if you are looking for 100% flawless.</li>
      <li>I ordered light color, it is really for very light skin, be attentive choosing color!</li>
      <li>so I tried out the Organic wear cc cream in light.</li>
      <li>I am using the Light shade as an undereye and spot concealer underneath the Light/Medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Id say it has light to  medium coverage.</li>
      <li>I read all of the reviews before choosing the Light color.</li>
      <li>It goes on evenly and smoothly with a sponge wedge applicator.</li>
      <li>This is a light coverage...</li>
      <li>Also the light shade worked well for us</li>
      <li>I have both the LIGHT and the LIGHT/MEDIUM shades.</li>
      <li>Moisturize first :)</li>
      <li>I use this on top or their Argon oil and love the natural, radiant look I get with it.  </li>
      <li>It blends easily and provides the right amount of coverage so that you can use this as makeup.</li>
      <li>Definitely a great price given some of the other competitors out on the market.</li>
      <li>To me it smells something like wheat, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and dissipates quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have found a new &#x27;foundation&#x27; after years of searching for one that does not contain all the toxic ingredients most foundations do.</li>
      <li>I actually prefer the texture and feel of PF&#x27;s BB Cream better, but their lightest shade is still too dark for my (very fair) skin.</li>
      <li>this won&#x27;t fit the fairest skin (aka me) or those who are much darker than me.</li>
      <li>This CC cream has great medium coverage without feeling heavy.</li>
      <li>Love the coverage, but the light is a little too light for me</li>
      <li>I ended up going back to Physician&#x27;s Formula Organic Wear 100% Natural Origin Tinted Moisturizer in ivory to fair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty lightweight</li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s a natural product is just fantastic, because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It covers my rosacea pretty well.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about  the color since there was only two to choose from but it works for my skin tone..........</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>This was my first time trying this product.  </li>
      <li>I love trying out new natural face makeups</li>
      <li>(I am 45 with light / fair skin and a low thyroid that loves to mess with my complexion.)</li>
      <li>Very oily on my very, very oily skin.</li>
      <li>At first it does have a strong smell, but later it fades.</li>
      <li>It is relatively light coverage, but with a good concealer over the worst blemishes it looks great.</li>
      <li>I also wish that it had a more dewy finish, and it has a strange scent that eventually dissipates.</li>
      <li>I usually get another week or two out of the opened tube, so it lasts a good while forme.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and customer service!  I recommend!  (I wish Physicians Formula made this in more shades for everyone.)</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time today and after wearing it for 8 hours it still looks great and it was 92 degrees here in Phoenix and I was outdoors today.&lt;br /&gt;It covers the redness well and I like the finish. Wasn&#x27;t sure about  the color since there was only two to choose from but it works for my skin tone..........</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It feels natural on my skin and it helps maintain under control the oil. At first it does have a strong smell, but later it fades.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a little more coverage than a tinted moisturizer, and this was perfect! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> good texture, good coverage...excellent product</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MAKEUP! I have been running the gamut on makeup that does not irritate my sensitive skin. (I am 45 with light / fair skin and a low thyroid that loves to mess with my complexion.) The consistency of this makeup is thick but it only takes a little and it has &amp;#34;buildable&amp;#34; coverage! I think it is very easy to apply. (I have also tried PF&#x27;s Organic Wear BB Cream, their regular BB Cream and CC cream but their Organic Wear CC Cream is the best in my opinion!) The Organic Wear CC Cream covers redness and evens out my skintone and conceals the occasional blemish. It does not sit in fine lines or wrinkles and does not sit on top of my skin. It is not drying or overly dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is mainly titanium dioxide (sunscreen) so it takes a few minutes to absorb and settle. I give it a few minutes after I apply it before I set it with just a touch of NYX Finishing Powder (which is 100% silica and does not dry my skin.)  I apply my makeup early in the morning before work and this CC cream lasts all day -- into the evening -- and I do not touch it up. The ingredients seem to agree with my skin very well and I&#x27;m really happy that I&#x27;ve found quick and easy makeup that stays on all day in this 100+ degree Georgia heat and humidity. (Even when we are outside all day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers say this makeup smells like play-doh and other odors but to me it just has a VERY FAINT, quickly dissipating oatmeal smell to it that is gone just as fast as I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing the Light shade for several months but the Light/Medium shade is too yellow-orange for my complexion. The Light shade is very difficult to find locally (though the Light/Medium shade seems to always be in stock!) so I am very happy to have found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the tube seems to be out of makeup, I snip the bottom of the tube off and us a Q-Tip to use all of the makeup. I usually get another week or two out of the opened tube, so it lasts a good while forme. (I stick it in an air-tight container to store it once I cut the tube end off.)</li>
    <li> I have celiac gluten allergy and this is one makeup product clearly labeled gluten free which is great.  Would like a bit more color and stay power but would buy again.  I buy organic as much as possible.  Nice consistency.</li>
    <li> This goes on quite thickly in my opinion.  I actually cut it with other non-tinted facial cream to lighten it a bit.  I&#x27;m not a huge makeup person and like to use foundation as a quick moisturizer and color toner and be off.... this takes a little patience to rub in.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s 100% natural. I do tend to have to use a lot of it, which is disappointing...but it feels very light on your skin and blends well. I sweat a lot, it does sweat off a little, but I&#x27;ve had much better luck with this than other products. I don&#x27;t always have to wear it with a powder or another product, but also equally works great with those other products if you are looking for 100% flawless. I like the natural look to it and the coverage it provide in itself. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like it! I have both the LIGHT and the LIGHT/MEDIUM shades. My winter skin is paler than my summer skin, but I still need the Light/Medium shade for my face in winter.&lt;br /&gt;The Light/Medium is a good match for me and I use it as a foundation. I am using the Light shade as an undereye and spot concealer underneath the Light/Medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can look dry/flaky on dry areas of my skin. Moisturize first :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is very good! I use one application and it lasts a long time. I heard about it from a youtuber who recommended it as a foundation for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> the only complaint i have about this product is the poor color selection. this won&#x27;t fit the fairest skin (aka me) or those who are much darker than me. i can kind of get away with it because i blend it down my neck but i don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll repurchase, solely for the color. it stinks because i actually really love the product! it&#x27;s a light/medium coverage and natural satin finish. great applied with a damp sponge.</li>
    <li> Too cakey for me. I use a BB cream and I really like the coverage, it blends well and doesnt cake or look like im wearing make up. This one is very obvious and I dont like it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this foundation.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. Love it.</li>
    <li> Does not look nice on the skin, settles into pores and creases around nose.</li>
    <li> Since other reviews had said this and the BB were darker then expected I went with the light/medium, but it&#x27;s more light. Slightly too pale for me. The coverage is not as layer-able as I&#x27;d hoped. I was really hoping for a foundation that had more beneficial, less toxic, ingredients and and SPF, which it does; but also had thicker coverage if needed, which it doesn&#x27;t. The plus side, the ingredients are helping my skin. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it a fourth star.</li>
    <li> This is way too dark for natural redheads.  However, it&#x27;s a very comfortable sunscreen, which doesn&#x27;t irritate, or burn sensitive skin, even with regular use.  I bought this, thinking it would be good makeup, and then kept it to use as a sunscreen. It&#x27;s very soothing, and it stays on well in winter weather. It won&#x27;t disappear in dry winds. As a sunscreen, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very oily on my very, very oily skin. Felt gritty and had a chemical, tea like smell to it. Uncomfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Waaaay too light, and I am extremely pale</li>
    <li> Too dry for my skin type. Accentuated every skin flaw i.e. enlarge pores, wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this CC cream.  It feels pretty thick and almost sticky when I apply it, and I don&#x27;t feel that the coverage is natural looking.</li>
    <li> I have found a new &#x27;foundation&#x27; after years of searching for one that does not contain all the toxic ingredients most foundations do. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, will buy it again</li>
    <li> Great ingredient list, but poor foundation. It feels rather heavy on the skin and gets shiny easily. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people who have normal to oily skin. However, product has GREAT coverage, but oxidizes A LOT darker than it looks.</li>
    <li> I used  before few types of corean BB creams and was really interested in CC. This type of cream have minimal covering option, it is light and personally for me its better to use it with concealer and powder. I ordered light color, it is really for very light skin, be attentive choosing color!</li>
    <li> it is very lighter than my skin</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s my only problem with Organic Wear products -- they tend to be introduced and then disappear rather quickly.  This is a product I absolutely love.  I had been paying more than twice as much for another natural brand&#x27;s CC cream, but all that brand&#x27;s foundations were too yellow for me, even the &amp;#34;pink undertone&amp;#34; ones.  I found this CC cream in a grocery store, of all places, and decided to try it.  It matches my skin tone much better than the expensive CC creams and is just as long-wearing, with full coverage.  And I like that there are no nasty ingredients in it.  As long as they keep making it, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I initially didn&#x27;t buy this because I was concerned it would be too dark or look orange on me since I&#x27;m consistently the lightest shade in any makeup. After buying an organic cc cream that was 4 times the price and being disappointed, I went ahead and bought this. I&#x27;m glad that I did. It blends easily and provides the right amount of coverage so that you can use this as makeup. Best of all, it is not too dark for my fair skin.</li>
    <li> the price point is great considering I usually pay double if I purchase it directly from a pharmacy. But the color was lighter than I expected even though I already use the regular Physicians CC Cream. Easy to apply but it left a lot of streaks even after going over it with a brush. Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I got the lightest shade that they offer, and it is too dark for my pale skin tone. Other than that, it is a decent CC cream. It acts like a foundation, covering my blemishes (and even my dark circles). I would not repurchase due to the lack of variety in colors — anyone very dark or very light-skinned would not want to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Nice feel, great coverage, I only need to apply 1x a day, and true to color. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> This is a great natural foundation. I had tried this brand&#x27;s tinted moisturizing cream but found it didn&#x27;t offer enough coverage for imperfections and was a bit shiny for my combination skin. This CC cream has great medium coverage without feeling heavy. In fact I feel like it gives my skin a nice glow without being too shiny (as long as i don&#x27;t moisturize just prior to putting it on. My moisturizer is jojoba oil so this foundation with the oil does make my skin too shiny/oily-looking so be mindful of that if you have oily skin.) Honestly, it goes on just like a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; foundation in my opinion. I was lucky enough to find this in my local grocery store for about the same price as listed here on Amazon (but I save on shipping cost of course.) Overall, I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I wish that I could wear this but it comes out too pinkish and warm for my skin tone (I&#x27;m fair with yellow under tones). However, I like the coverage and it isn&#x27;t too drying. I also wish that it had a more dewy finish, and it has a strange scent that eventually dissipates.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this CC cream is the only foundation type product that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin. Most things either break me out or burn my skin. It is relatively light coverage, but with a good concealer over the worst blemishes it looks great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months and I absolutely love it! It gives you just enough coverage to use under powder. It hasn&#x27;t caused any blemishes and overall seems to keep my skin more even and clear. It&#x27;s a tinted moisturizer and not a concealer. Great product, highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Love the coverage, but the light is a little too light for me</li>
    <li> I really like the coverage and color of this product. I actually prefer the texture and feel of PF&#x27;s BB Cream better, but their lightest shade is still too dark for my (very fair) skin. This CC Cream matches my skin tone pretty well, and the coverage is good (I would say medium). However, I also definitely noticed the smell that other reviewers have written about. It&#x27;s not downright awful, but it is strong and kind of smells to me like a bottle of old sunscreen gone bad. It was strong enough that I dabbed a drop of body splash under my nose so I wouldn&#x27;t notice it. My friends didn&#x27;t notice the smell on me, but they could definitely smell it coming out of the bottle, and without the perfume, I could smell it for awhile after applying. I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of this bottle, but I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying it again just because the smell bothers me.</li>
    <li> Greasy and orangey. An unfortunate purchase. Not good for my fairly pale skin.</li>
    <li> This product is very thick and mask like, but it covers and evens the skin nicely. After a couple hours though, it seems to soak into the pores which bothers me. And it is definitely is not matte, and makes my t zone shinier. Good coverage, but overall I wont buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I like the coverage of this and the fact that it&#x27;s lightweight. It is however, quite orange and rather dark for being the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  Even though it is a CC cream and not a foundation, it provides just as much coverage as a foundation.  It is a really nice product that blends well, causes no irritation, and provides great coverage.  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is sooooo gentle on my skin.  I use this on top or their Argon oil and love the natural, radiant look I get with it.  This is a light coverage...so sometimes something a little thicker is needed if you have brown spots or something else you are wanting to cover.</li>
    <li> I love trying out new natural face makeups so I tried out the Organic wear cc cream in light.Well the colors a little too dark for my fair skin but with some translucent powder you cant tell.The texture is kinda runny and in the winter its a little too dry for me but for summer I think it will be great.It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell that I can tell.It does a pretty decent  job of covering redness Id say it has light to  medium coverage.Also its cruelty free!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide 3.9%, Zinc Oxide 1% Inactive Ingredients: Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Water, Dodecane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Silica, Glycerin+, Lecithin, Water, Magnesium Sulfate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Beeswax, Porphyra Umbilicalis Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Cyamopsis Tetragonoloba (Guar) Gum, Lauroyl Lysine, Leuconostoc / Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Leuconostoc Ferment Filtrate.

    <li> I love this CC cream: the formula is very light and not greasy at all. The coverage is light, therefore I do not recommend it to people who have blemishes to cover or dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;It covers my rosacea pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t melt during the day, but I still recommend using a translucent powder to fix it. The fact that it&#x27;s a natural product is just fantastic, because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and doesn&#x27;t break me out. I can use it repetitively during the week and my skin won&#x27;t suffer. Highly recommended, especially for the price point!</li>
    <li> If you do not mind kind of the odd but not to strong smell, it is a very good makeup. I think we get used to all the pretty smelling chemicals that are bad for our skin.</li>
    <li> Organic is best cc cream for my complexion thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Although lighter than expected, it works for the winter months when I&#x27;m indoors more often. Good quality coverage.</li>
    <li> Coverage good - takes some getting used to.  unhappy about some of the ingredients - will be looking for a cleaner formulation or use their BB cream which passes EWG test.  Google &amp;#34;Skin Deep&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this CC cream for well over a month now and I love it!  Check out my demo &amp; review here:  [...]</li>
    <li> This cover cream is gritty.  There isn&#x27;t any coverage.  I use it as a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I really like the coverage of this CC cream.  I am fair (always one of the lightest colors available in foundation/concealer) and this works on my skin.  It does have a slight orange tint at first, but as I rub it in, that fades.  It lasts me all day.  I&#x27;ve used Physician Formula Organic tinted moisturizer in the past, and as a comparison, this has more coverage and lasts longer.  But the tinted moisturizer has more color options, which I am hopeful they will someday add to this product.  Also, this does have an odd scent.  To me it smells something like wheat, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and dissipates quickly.  I&#x27;ll buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: As I got paler in the fall and winter the color looked more and more orange on me. I ended up going back to Physician&#x27;s Formula Organic Wear 100% Natural Origin Tinted Moisturizer in ivory to fair. The coverage is lighter, but it matches my skin tone better.</li>
    <li> Gave it a 4 star rating because it felt a little caky/dry being put on. I did like the coverage. Sadly though it irritates my skin.</li>
    <li> Finally, I have found an all in one foundation/moisturizer/concealer that does not make my skin breakout.  Other drug stores brands would wreak havoc on my skin, and I was only wearing them about 2-3 days a week...then have to deal with the breakouts for weeks after.  I use other physician&#x27;s formula products and love them so I thought I would give this a try.  Covers imperfections without settling into fine lines and does not leave a greasy mess by the end of the work day.  I apply a small amount of physicians formula loose powder on top of the CC. I am into natural products that don&#x27;t have parabens and other toxic chemicals to sludge up my liver, and this CC fits the bill.  The smell is a little strange, but doesn&#x27;t last long.  Perfumes are totally unnecessary in cosmetics and are just another chemical for the liver to metabolize. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Covers well and doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this product.  It is a tad darker than I had expected but it&#x27;s not horrible.  I think it goes one more shade down so I may try to order it next time.  Definitely a great price given some of the other competitors out on the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving this organic cc! So is my daughter who is using mine up! ;) I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me, I had oily combination skin with large pores but now with perimenopause it&#x27;s dry as the desert with large pores, yuk! So I thought it might sit in the pores &amp; look terrible like lots of tinted moisturizers &amp; foundations I&#x27;ve tried. But it doesn&#x27;t, it looks fresh &amp; natural. Now my daughter has acne prone skin &amp; tiny pores &amp; it looks really lovely &amp; natural on her. We both had been using the popular mineral makeup for years, but now eerie of it with the whole nano particle debate wanted something different. We&#x27;ve been eliminating chemicals from our products the past few years &amp; also making many of our own. Anyways, the best way we found to apply this is to moisturize first of course, then shake the cc tube, squeeze a small amount on a little sponge &amp; dab around, then blend QUICKLY as it tends to dry fast! Also the light shade worked well for us we are fairly close in color with neutral undertones. Hope this is helpful to someone. :)</li>
    <li> I really like this. I read all of the reviews before choosing the Light color. I&#x27;m glad I did. It matches perfectly. It goes on evenly and smoothly with a sponge wedge applicator. I would say the only complaint would be if my skin is dry, it tends to show the color more in my pores. I still really like it though. I just put powder over it anyway. It&#x27;s pretty lightweight and I LOVE that it&#x27;s not greasy or oily. It&#x27;s more of a matte finish. I have VERY VERY sensitive skin and I have never had any breakouts with this product. I&#x27;m on my 2nd tube and plan to keep using it. This is probably the longest I&#x27;ve stuck to using any sort of &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Do not like it-causes redness and itching.  Will not be able to use this product.</li>
    <li> Amaze. Purchased with the intent of switching over to more healthy makeup products. Was shocked to find that my skin looks visibly better in three days :)</li>
