      <li>it&#x27;s all natural and feels amazing.</li>
      <li>I love this whole line...</li>
      <li>] when the weather is hot, Simple Vital Night Cream does a great job for the winter version of my skin!</li>
      <li>I have been happy with this product as it is neither to heavy or light.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and somehow seems to respond negatively to most pharmacy moisturizers or acne products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not bad if you&#x27;re looking for something reasonably priced, available on Amazon or your local drug store, and easy on your skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other Simple products (eye cream, cleaning cloths) and have found that they are very good in a pinch.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Might be too rich for summer, but the day cream is rich enough to work day and night in warmer weather.</li>
      <li>But I didn&#x27;t see or feel any remarkable difference in my skin after using it for a couple of weeks, as opposed to using more expensive and reliable products from Shiseido.  </li>
      <li>I love this night cream, especially for the cooler weather.</li>
      <li>This cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive, acne prone skin!</li>
      <li>The product was not the best, it feels a little heavy on my skin.</li>
      <li>I really like this night cream.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>This night cream is wonderful and moisturizes deeply without irritating your skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is on the sensitive side, so I stick to Simple, Aveeno and Neutrogena products mostly.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have to worry about crying in pain from the burning tingly sensation I had gotten from other moisturizers, I was saved and life was good!</li>
      <li>Finding a good moisturizer that didn&#x27;t contain alcohol and wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores (leading to more acne) has been very difficult.</li>
      <li>I stopped using this cream mainly because I was trying to &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; my skin care routine and also I found that jojoba oil or grapeseed oil (used by katy perry</li>
      <li>Simple is super.</li>
      <li>The one positive is that it did leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>then I will rinse my face of any excess oil, and pat dry with a clean</li>
      <li>Must\\&quot; for sensitive skin because it is gentle and for the first time it took away the blotches and uneveness attributed to more complex creams.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, so when I find something I can use, I stick with it.  </li>
      <li>- wow!</li>
      <li>I have normal to oily skin and have slightly sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I use other Simple products for my sensitive skin and have not had too many problems with them.  </li>
      <li>Simple diminishes lines and closes large pores.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased Simple&#x27;s &amp;#34;replenishing : rich moisturizer&amp;#34; and in comparison it&#x27;s no good, not for what I need anyway, primarily because it has a lil bit of alcohol in it and</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin and</li>
      <li>This night cream caused my sensitive skin to burn and even though I did not put it around my eyes, just having it on my cheek bones and forehead caused my eyes to burn and feel gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but if you have ULTRA sensitive skin...dont use it.</li>
      <li>I wake up with my skin feeling soft and hydrated, not oily.  </li>
      <li>I have REALLY sensitive skin</li>
      <li>There are no harsh chemicals and the proof is in my face.  </li>
      <li>This cream was far too greasy for me.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive combination skin</li>
      <li>, I went through 1.7 oz fairly quickly, but I will take what I can get, as long as I can get, Simple Vital Vitamin Night</li>
      <li>Slight discoloration has been minimized and my I use less products because my skin is absorbing products better.</li>
      <li>As far as night creams go though, it is not very heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>skin gets painfully dry , when it is not the weather, it&#x27;s most certainly the combination of dermatologist prescribed topical medications which do wonders at sucking my acne dry but also leave the rest of my face dry in the process.</li>
      <li>and I was willing to try it based on other reviews.  </li>
      <li>I have tried almost every product out there and the only thing that doesn&#x27;t break me out is olay sensitive skin wipes and vitamin E oil</li>
      <li>So far I have only found one skin care product to work for me my entire life which was an oil of olay cream cleanser for sensitive skin...</li>
      <li>When I can&#x27;t afford the Aveda Tourmaline Hydrating Creme, I use Simple vital night cream....</li>
      <li>I bought Simple&#x27;s vital vitamin night face cream on a whim when I saw it on the clearance rack at Walmart</li>
      <li>During such times I need Simple Vital Vitamin Night Cream!</li>

<li> I was hoping that maybe I could find something less expensive that would give me the same excellent results, but unfortunately that was not the case</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is that I wish they sold it in a bigger jar--I have to buy a new jar about every three weeks.  </li>
<li> I would recommend using this cream as a day cream as well instead of using the other Simple moisturizers.</li>
<li> You can still find this cream online, but it won&#x27;t be around long as it is no longer being made - so get it while you can!</li>
<li> I helps with her dry skin.</li>
<li> Even the next morning, I felt like my face had not absorbed any of it, and I was breaking out all over.</li>
<li> so I am really really careful about what I can put on it.</li>
<li> I usually have to switch products sometimes and recently discovered i need to start using a night cream.</li>
<li> NOT a fun thing to explain at work.  </li>
<li> and it took me a little over a week to get rid of the itchy rashy wreck that my face had become.  </li>
<li> It left my skin feeling dirty and gritty after putting it on.</li>
<li> thought it would go away after a few days of use</li>
<li> Needless to say if you have mildy sensitive skin this may work for you</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have sensitive combination skin and I have a hard time finding moisturizers that work well.&lt;br /&gt;This makes my skin feel supple without making it feel oily. Works great, no strong smell, great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for face prep at night</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  There are no harsh chemicals and the proof is in my face.  This is \\&quot;A Must\\&quot; for sensitive skin because it is gentle and for the first time it took away the blotches and uneveness attributed to more complex creams.</li>
    <li> Simple diminishes lines and closes large pores.  It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.  I have very sensitive skin, so when I find something I can use, I stick with it.  Simple is super.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I bought if for my daughter and she loves it. I helps with her dry skin.</li>
    <li> I still wish I knew why it was discontinued in the U.S. This night cream is wonderful and moisturizes deeply without irritating your skin. It seems that everything that works well gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> (Update) This is still a very good cream, especially for the overly zealous when it comes to layering drying acne products. I stopped using this cream mainly because I was trying to &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; my skin care routine and also I found that jojoba oil or grapeseed oil (used by katy perry so must be good) are excellent SINGLE INGREDIENT products that hydrate well and don&#x27;t burn.... I&#x27;ll massage the oil onto damp skin, (if you continue to massage you&#x27;ll find small blackheads will come up from skin!) then I will rinse my face of any excess oil, and pat dry with a clean towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin gets painfully dry , when it is not the weather, it&#x27;s most certainly the combination of dermatologist prescribed topical medications which do wonders at sucking my acne dry but also leave the rest of my face dry in the process. Finding a good moisturizer that didn&#x27;t contain alcohol and wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores (leading to more acne) has been very difficult. I bought Simple&#x27;s vital vitamin night face cream on a whim when I saw it on the clearance rack at Walmart and it was a great decision! Calmed my chemically irritated skin and made it look and feel good! I didn&#x27;t have to worry about crying in pain from the burning tingly sensation I had gotten from other moisturizers, I was saved and life was good! That was until I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore, and now I&#x27;m freaking out!!!! I&#x27;ve purchased Simple&#x27;s &amp;#34;replenishing : rich moisturizer&amp;#34; and in comparison it&#x27;s no good, not for what I need anyway, primarily because it has a lil bit of alcohol in it and it hurts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I am not always kind to my skin. I get stressed by my acne and sometimes at my weakest I pick , over wash and over medicate my skin resulting in painful dryness. During such times I need Simple Vital Vitamin Night Cream! I neeeeeeed it. I need something that will make up for the bad things I do to my skin. I also need it to be about 3x the size of the current jar, I went through 1.7 oz fairly quickly, but I will take what I can get, as long as I can get, Simple Vital Vitamin Night cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Katie</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthitician, trained through Aveda. When I can&#x27;t afford the Aveda Tourmaline Hydrating Creme, I use Simple vital night cream....it&#x27;s all natural and feels amazing. I have dehydrated skin and it hydrates wonderfully!! I can&#x27;t understand why the company had discontinued producing it!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and somehow seems to respond negatively to most pharmacy moisturizers or acne products. I first starting using the night cream as a day moisturizer too, and my skin responded great. My makeup went on so well, it didn&#x27;t look caky at all. My skin felt and looked so even and amazing. I would recommend using this cream as a day cream as well instead of using the other Simple moisturizers. They simply do not moisturize as well; I tried using the Simple Replenishing Day cream and my skin didn&#x27;t respond as well as it did to this one.</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream. It causes no irritation, feels light yet leaves my skin feeling well hydrated. Wonderful line of products but for whatever reason they are becoming harder to find in the stores and the price has jumped pretty high when I can find them.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream, especially for the cooler weather. It absorbs nicely, makes my skin feel soft and smooth and my skin feels great when I wake up in the morning. I feel like this cream works best with combination skin. For super oily skin, it may not be the best product. As far as night creams go though, it is not very heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I still love using [[ASIN:B0039QD1U8 H2O Plus Face Oasis Hydrating Treatment 50ml/1.7oz]] when the weather is hot, Simple Vital Night Cream does a great job for the winter version of my skin!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 night creams.  One was brand new and the second had previously been opened.  I had expected NEW.</li>
    <li> Five stars for no strong scent or chemicals.  I have been happy with this product as it is neither to heavy or light.  I use it daily and have had no skin irritation.</li>
    <li> You can still find this cream online, but it won&#x27;t be around long as it is no longer being made - so get it while you can! It is wonderful stuff: light and creamy moisturizer without being greasy or heavy - wow! That is hard to find in my experience.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother and she has used it for awhile now and in all honesty this one night cream she thinks is better than oild of Olay and believe that is a compliment. The item arrived well before the dates that the vendor had on the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that says a lot about the vendor and the aspect of customer service. I will indeed order this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Simple products (eye cream, cleaning cloths) and have found that they are very good in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this cream is soothing and non-irritating when applied.  But I didn&#x27;t see or feel any remarkable difference in my skin after using it for a couple of weeks, as opposed to using more expensive and reliable products from Shiseido.  I was hoping that maybe I could find something less expensive that would give me the same excellent results, but unfortunately that was not the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad if you&#x27;re looking for something reasonably priced, available on Amazon or your local drug store, and easy on your skin. Maybe for someone else the results will be spectacular - but not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product and pissed that it was discontinued. It is non greasy and felt amazing on the skin! Very light too!</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived when they said it would.</li>
    <li> I love this whole line...I had oily problematic skin that was so horrible before I started using this. My bad acne prone skin took a toll on my self confidence and no dermatologist could help me. As a last resort I tried this line and I am so happy to report that my skin is no longer full of acne and the marks are clearing up with the help of some Ambi. This was a great investment and i am happy with my results.</li>
    <li> reordered for my wife. even though some places were out of stock.amazon had it</li>
    <li> I have experienced breakouts since grade school and my skin has gotten better over the years. In order to properly take care of it, I have to follow a skincare regimen. I usually have to switch products sometimes and recently discovered i need to start using a night cream. I wash with Avalon, using my Mia and use Simple at night. It makes my skin feel so smooth. Slight discoloration has been minimized and my I use less products because my skin is absorbing products better. I have normal to oily skin and have slightly sensitive skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> I use other Simple products for my sensitive skin and have not had too many problems with them.  This product, however, is one I will not be using again.  This night cream caused my sensitive skin to burn and even though I did not put it around my eyes, just having it on my cheek bones and forehead caused my eyes to burn and feel gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would go away after a few days of use but it did not.  I will have to find another night cream product that does not cause a reaction. The one positive is that it did leave my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Shipping was timely, came in the original packaging. The product was not the best, it feels a little heavy on my skin. I have been wearing it for about a month, and it does the job for a good price but I will not be switching to it any time soon.</li>
    <li> seems to work well, not greasy and keeps face feeling moist, always difficult to see you things are working but I like it</li>
    <li> I have REALLY sensitive skin so I am really really careful about what I can put on it. I have tried almost every product out there and the only thing that doesn&#x27;t break me out is olay sensitive skin wipes and vitamin E oil BUT that just doesn&#x27;t do my skin justice.  So far I have only found one skin care product to work for me my entire life which was an oil of olay cream cleanser for sensitive skin...well they dont make it anymore so I have been searching for something that wont react badly on my skin.  This line seemed like the perfect fit and I was willing to try it based on other reviews.  It turns out I had a horrible reaction to it and it took me a little over a week to get rid of the itchy rashy wreck that my face had become.  NOT a fun thing to explain at work.  Needless to say if you have mildy sensitive skin this may work for you but if you have ULTRA sensitive skin...dont use it.</li>
    <li> nice texture; NO perfume, NO dyes!</li>
    <li> This night cream is rich without being oily - excellent for dry, chapped winter skin. Might be too rich for summer, but the day cream is rich enough to work day and night in warmer weather. Quite pleased with the results AND the price.</li>
    <li> This cream was far too greasy for me. It left my skin feeling dirty and gritty after putting it on. Even the next morning, I felt like my face had not absorbed any of it, and I was breaking out all over. I have combination skin. I guess this must only be for people with really, really dry skin. But I absolutely hated the way this felt on my face. Gross. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three months.  My skin is on the sensitive side, so I stick to Simple, Aveeno and Neutrogena products mostly.  I apply a generous amount at night and my skin sucks it up.  I wake up with my skin feeling soft and hydrated, not oily.  I also apply a very thin layer in the mornings before my moisturizer, since my skin tends to be on the dry side.  The only complaint I have is that I wish they sold it in a bigger jar--I have to buy a new jar about every three weeks.  Overall I like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Does moisturize skin, especially during the winter months, but has a weird petroleum / industrial chemical smell.</li>
    <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive, acne prone skin! Also, it took care of the inevitable winter dry-skin peeling.</li>
