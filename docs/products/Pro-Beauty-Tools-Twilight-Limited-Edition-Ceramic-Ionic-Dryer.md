      <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>love that its purple my favorite color.</li>
      <li>The Twilight purple thing was more for my daughter</li>
      <li>anyway; great dryer, i highly recommend!</li>
      <li>but I love this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I use the diffusing attachment and it takes a while, but my hair just looks to be in much better condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had co-workers notice my hair looked in better condition.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>I love this dryer; it has every feature that i wanted.  </li>
      <li>I am Very happy with this so far, it is light yet very powerful and nicely designed.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to everyone.</li>
      <li>I like the beautiful shiny finish along with the soft rubber grip.</li>
      <li>The cord also has one of those velcro straps on it so that you can easily wind up and secure the cord and not trip over it.</li>
      <li>Huge Twilight fan.</li>
      <li>Diffuser is huge and makes my curls bounce.  </li>
      <li>for the important part for me - maintaining my frizz.</li>
      <li>but I now fight her for this hair dryer because it does such a great job on my hair.</li>
      <li>I knew I didn&#x27;t want a cheap hair dryer</li>
      <li>When I straighten my hair, it turns out shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>Gripping this hair dryer is also extremely comfortable and it is very lightweight which makes handling it easy.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this hair dryer for my daughter.  </li>
      <li>I like how the filter cover comes off so you can clean the filter</li>
      <li>Never really used the concentrator  attachment but the diffuser is great.</li>
      <li>, I love it so much.</li>
      <li>It has 3 speed and heat options and a cool shot.  </li>
      <li>and it holds true to the advertisement.</li>
      <li>In short - it&#x27;s a good dryer.</li>
      <li>I guess if you order one be sure to really look close at it before you use it so you can return it if it was damaged in shipping.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and the dark purple color is unique and distinquished.</li>
      <li>I shopped and investigated so many hair dryers looking for a lighter, more quiet hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, soft hair, but a lot of it.</li>
      <li>i bought it at the same time i bought the steam setter, and i love it!  </li>
      <li>love that the back comes off for easy cleaning.... not to mention that it&#x27;s sparkly purple with the twilight logo.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but curly hair, so when my bedhead blowdryer bit the dust I wanted a reasonably priced replacement.  </li>
      <li>After only one use of this dryer, I am able to tell a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and seems to do a great job without frying my hair.  </li>
      <li>to help straighten out those curls without causing too much damage, and with the price, this fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>The dryer itself is actually built quite nicely.</li>
      <li>aside from it being a Twilight edition product, i love that its not heavy</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s nice and quiet, doesn&#x27;t make my ears ring!</li>
      <li>I was used to a loud hair dryer, this one has lots of power, I only have to use it on medium speed, it has 3 speeds and 3 heat settings, works great.  </li>
      <li>I have used it a few times now and love it!!</li>
      <li>but the crack is right at the on/off switch.</li>
      <li>but this is just the right weight for styling.  </li>
      <li>The diffuser is a nice size, enough to take in a large section of hair, and seems to spread heat evenly.</li>
      <li>It was just about 5 dollars more and well worth the extra.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d put it up against a $100 professional dryer, easily.</li>
      <li>Four stars instead of five because it doesn&#x27;t feel super powerful, but it works well, is lightweight and easy to manage, and the attachments similarly do their jobs.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The shipping cost was very reasonable and delivery came as stated.</li>
      <li>also appreciate the different temperature settings of Hot, Warm, Cool and the Cool shot button, since I was hoping to use cooler air so as not to defeat the purpose of the no-heat Curlformers, and to avoid too much heat in general.</li>
      <li>my favorite features are the multi temperature and different speeds.  </li>
      <li>and i have the most uncontrollable hair possible</li>
      <li>, thanks!</li>
      <li>of all - it&#x27;s really a pretty hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I have read the books, yes, and I&#x27;ve seen the first movie.</li>
      <li>and i love the heat controls, where as my last hair dryer would over heat my hair and burn my hair.</li>
      <li>I was greatly surprised when I used this one and found it to be super light, easy to manage, and more quiet than any other dryer I have used.  </li>
      <li>various speeds and temperatures, including cool plus the cool shot button.  </li>
      <li>(and to be honest the dark purple is pretty)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this for my Granddaughter for her B-day.  She told that she loves it and it holds true to the advertisement.</li>
    <li> Let me be frank - I am not a TwiHard or whatever those crazy kids are calling themselves. I have read the books, yes, and I&#x27;ve seen the first movie. That is about as far as my expertise goes. The reason I bought this dryer is because I really needed one with a diffuser (per my bossy hairdresser), and this was the only one with a diffuser at the store, and was priced right. So, I figured I&#x27;d give it a chance. I have to admit, I tried to hide the box when I got it home, because I would never hear the end of it from my husband. I failed, however, and he&#x27;s still making fun of me.  Now that I have that out of the way, on to my review:  The dryer itself is actually built quite nicely. The handle is comfortable, has an easy grip and the barrel is a good length so that I don&#x27;t have to hold my arm out at an awkward angle to get the back of my hair/nape of my neck. The cord also has one of those velcro straps on it so that you can easily wind up and secure the cord and not trip over it. There are adjustable speeds, high and low, and adjustable temps - cold, low, and high. As a plus, it&#x27;s a nice shade of purple, my favorite color.  The diffuser is a nice size, enough to take in a large section of hair, and seems to spread heat evenly. The \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; also feel really good on my scalp. I&#x27;m mostly impressed by the drying speed. I am growing out a perm, but still do \\&quot;lazy girl curls\\&quot; (where you twist/wind your hair and then pin it while it dries to create an easy, loose curl). Usually I blow dry my bangs, and drive to work with clips still in my hair, and then shake them out before I go inside, and then it air-dries. I lose quite a bit of volume doing this, and my hair sort of wilts by the end of the day and looks messy and disheveled. Now, I use the concentrator to dry my bangs and roots around the clips, and let my hair sit in the clips while I get dressed, feed the dogs, do makeup, etc. I then shake my hair out, and diffuse on low speed/high heat until it&#x27;s dry - which only takes about 5 minutes for my entire head of hair. With my regular ionizing dryer, it takes about 15 minutes and I end up with frizz, no matter what. This dryer leaves my hair soft and non-frizztastic.   As for product, I use Bedhead Curl Up shampoo and conditioner, and a tiny bit of Artec Kiwi color reflector smoothing creme before combing my hair out and then twisting/clipping it. I have very fine, soft hair, but a lot of it. I originally got a perm because I wanted curly hair, but could not get curls to stay, no matter how hard I tried. Even when I could get my hair to curl as I wanted, the curl would fall out within a matter of hours, and my hair would be flat again. I would ALWAYS have to air dry, because using the blow dryer would cause an Einstein hairdo. Using this blow dryer seems to encourage the curls to stay in all day, and I am able to get a long lasting boost at the roots so my hair stays lively, but with the low speed I can keep myself from looking cracky.  In short - it&#x27;s a good dryer. Yeah, it&#x27;s gimmicky with the whole \\&quot;Twilight\\&quot; thing, but for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve been 100% happy with the results, and would recommend it to anyone with... well, hair. It works on mine, straight or curly. Once I figure out how to scrape off the Twilight logo, I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> It started on fire when I used it</li>
    <li> I got this hair-dryer for Christmas.  I needed a new one as my old one was on its last legs.and being a twilight fan it was great that they brought this out this Christmas.  I saw this in a local catalogue  and went straight home to look up the product online as i hadn&#x27;t seen or heard of it.  turns out they&#x27;ve also made twilight straighteners, curlers and hair brushes.  The products are made by the the company PRO beauty tools, which to be honest i had never heard of, but they are apparently good makers of celebrity hairstyling products. The hair dryer and other tools were made specifically for twilight breaking dawn and were used on the set of the movie. They are released by summit entertainment. which it makes it a must have for any twilight saga fan.  now on to the hair dryer itself.  The hair dryer comes nicely boxed with a picture of the hair dryer on the front (and bella and edward.) with details of the item, it also says that it was used on the set and is limited edition (so get in now folks!!!) the side of the box has information on what sparkle ceramic technology and sparkle ionic technology does.  The hair dryer comes with a slim concentrator nozzle and a diffuser.  The hair dryer is a lovely glittery purple with twilight written on, i was quite surprised when i picked it up how light it was, my last hair dryer was quite heavy compared to this one and often made my arm ache but this is just the right weight for styling.  It has 3 speed and heat options and a cool shot.  The speed options are great, they can be used on all types of hair, the slowest option is most likely better for fine thin hair, the medium is better for layered thick hair and the strongest is better for thick long hair that takes longer to dry. i would say the same with the 3 heat options. It also has a hang-up loop for when not in use.  it also comes with instructions and a styling guide. i was expecting a little booklet of styling tips but all it is, is a piece of cardboard with bella and edward on the front and styling tips on the back but on the box there is a smartphone square that loads an app with more tips, though i have yet to do this.  I have used it a few times now and love it!! it drys my hair wonders! and keeps it shiny. It really isn&#x27;t just for twilight fans, even my mum likes it so if your just looking for a new decent hair dryer don&#x27;t let the twilight name put you off.  I would definitely recommend this product. I am now thinking about buying the straighteners to go with it.  so what ya waiting for buy it now before they sell out!!! :)</li>
    <li> aside from it being a Twilight edition product, i love that its not heavy and i love the heat controls, where as my last hair dryer would over heat my hair and burn my hair. i have not had that issue with this hair dryer. love that its purple my favorite color. couldnt be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice and quiet dryer and it has a super long cord.  I also like how it has two speed settings, three heat settings, and a diffuser.  A major drawback, though, is that my medium, long&#x27;ish hair gets painfully sucked up through the back and tangled up in the motor every time I use it unless I hold all my hair away from it as I&#x27;m drying it.  It is impossible to get it untangled even after immediately turning it off, so I have to either pull the stuck strands of hair out of my head or cut them off.  I cringe to think of all the stuck strands of hair building up around the motor over time.  Also, the dryer itself is so long that my arms are too short to use the tapered attachment.  I really wish I did buy this, but I wasn&#x27;t thi and threw away the box, so now I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> This product is a good blow dryer, love the color, accessories, and several choices of high, low, med, hot, or cold.</li>
    <li> Even though it says Twilight it is one of the best hair dryers that I have ever used. I wanted a chi but didn&#x27;t have the money. I can honestly say this is the best one to get if you can&#x27;t afford the chi hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. Great options and performs great&lt;br /&gt;Love the different attachments that are offered. Huge Twilight fan., thanks!</li>
    <li> hey there, it&#x27;s me again with another review! lol.  i bought it at the same time i bought the steam setter, and i love it!  it dries my hair way faster and is easier to use than my old hair dryer.  plus it doesn&#x27;t hurt my arm as much as the old one did.  it&#x27;s got great features. my favorite features are the multi temperature and different speeds.  i really like the color purple it came in too.  the concentrator included is really awesome too.  i&#x27;m not sure about the diffuser yet.  i&#x27;m not too big of a fan of  diffusers.  the fact that it&#x27;s got the velcro to keep the cord wound up is a very good thing.  it&#x27;s a really nice product for the price i paid for it.  i also give this a 5 stars rating too.</li>
    <li> This product works very well, I love it so much. I&#x27;m a twihard so to me this product worked very well with my hair</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is gracefully shaped, with isn&#x27;t shown in the product pictures. It&#x27;s lightweight, and quiet. It gives a lot of hair-drying. My very thick hair was dry in five minutes. It takes 20 minutes with my usual hair-dryer. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a really deep purple. The Twilight logo is subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric cord has a velcro wrap attachment, so that it stays neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron works really well with the Bella and Rosalie hair brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much nicer than a typical $20 hair-dryer. I&#x27;d put it up against a $100 professional dryer, easily.</li>
    <li> I was used to a loud hair dryer, this one has lots of power, I only have to use it on medium speed, it has 3 speeds and 3 heat settings, works great.  Dries my hair in half the time my old one did.  And it&#x27;s nice and quiet, doesn&#x27;t make my ears ring!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. Never really used the concentrator  attachment but the diffuser is great. I have owned 2 of these hair dryers-- they both lasted around 2 years. I&#x27;m not sure how that holds up in hair dryer years but I would buy it again.. if I could find it in stock anywhere now!</li>
    <li> I shopped and investigated so many hair dryers looking for a lighter, more quiet hair dryer.  I was greatly surprised when I used this one and found it to be super light, easy to manage, and more quiet than any other dryer I have used.  Plus, for me, bonus was the color...not that it helps with drying your hair, but it is a great machine.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer that I have ever had.  The cord is so long that I can walk around my bathroom while blow drying my hair</li>
    <li> I was looking for something light, since I have back and neck problems.  It&#x27;s light but not made well,  within the first week the base cracked.  I would not buy another one.</li>
    <li> I am Very happy with this so far, it is light yet very powerful and nicely designed.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> oh my gosh i love this - its kinda small but makes up for in the styling. it makes my hair soft and straight and i have the most uncontrollable hair possible</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly, dry hair.  I use the diffuser for curly days &amp; the other attachment for straighter days.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and seems to do a great job without frying my hair.  My last dryer was similar, but this does seem to do a better job.  The &amp;#34;other attachment&amp;#34; rotates so that you can direct the air flow without twisting your arm.  The only downside is that my fingers often hit the button and switch settings.  A tad annoying but I can live with it.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer; it has every feature that i wanted.  various speeds and temperatures, including cool plus the cool shot button.  nice diffuser and concentrator... love that the back comes off for easy cleaning.... not to mention that it&#x27;s sparkly purple with the twilight logo.  only bad thing was that right after i bought it, it went down a couple dollars!!  that&#x27;s always my luck!  anyway; great dryer, i highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer unaware that it refered to \\&quot;Twilight\\&quot; the movie. In any event, it is a great dryer, the 3 heat settings and cool blast button really create great looking hair. For the price, I wouldnt buy any other drier. The only thing is that sometimes it can get really hot if you have it on the high heat setting for a prolonged period (but i think this is normal/not unreasonable); on two occassions I have had to manually turn the electrical breakers back ON after the lights went out in my bathroom--but this could just be an issue in my apartment.  Nonetheless, I would recommend this dryer for someone who dries long hair every day or every 2 days.</li>
    <li> It is really good. powerful and relatively quiet. I did not notice about the Twilight Limited Edition at all when I ordered it. lol</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this hair dryer for my daughter.  She loves twilight.  Now, I use it more than she does!  The diffuser works wonderfully on my naturally wavy hair.  I can get great volume, spirals and waves without hardly any frizz or fuss!  This is a great product and the dark purple color is unique and distinquished.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer.  Makes my hair smooth and the cold blast gives it that extra shine without the static.  Diffuser is huge and makes my curls bounce.  Fast hair flow makes drying my thick hair less work.  This is my second one, only because I dropped the first one and couldn&#x27;t wait for the replacement!  I was so lost without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a blow dryer fanatic and don&#x27;t use them often, but wanted something that I could use for the occasional blowout and for my new Curlformers. I&#x27;ve also not had this item for long, so I can&#x27;t speak for its longevity or durability. However, I do love how light it is, along with ergonomical handle, making it great to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the different temperature settings of Hot, Warm, Cool and the Cool shot button, since I was hoping to use cooler air so as not to defeat the purpose of the no-heat Curlformers, and to avoid too much heat in general. Unfortunately, there is only a High/Low switch, with no Medium to be had, but I&#x27;ll survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if I could do without the Twilight aspect, I admit I partly got it for the color and wasn&#x27;t disappointed there--though I did snicker at seeing Twi&#x27;ers on the box when I got mine delivered. I have a feeling that the Revlon Rvdr5029 is the same thing (don&#x27;t quote me on that), so I may go for that if I decide to go for a back up since it&#x27;s less expensive at the moment. I&#x27;m not sure if the Revlon comes with a diffuser though, so that may be something for people to consider if they&#x27;re after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it says nowhere on the box or Amazon&#x27;s description, it&#x27;s 1875W in case anyone&#x27;s wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: Still was loving my blow dryer, and even my Mom fancied it while using it on vacation. Sadly, I decided to leave it at my brother&#x27;s in another state so I didn&#x27;t have to hog up my suitcase on other visits (something I now regret). So I&#x27;m back to getting a new one, only I&#x27;m seeing it&#x27;s marked way up. Just wanted to add that I paid around $23 for mine when I initially wrote this review. Looks like I&#x27;ll be getting the Revlon version, but definitely recommend this unit otherwise.</li>
    <li> My daughter and wife assure me that it works like it should and the dryer will not turn you into a vampire, despite the name.</li>
    <li> I really like how this blow dryer works, however it quit on me not to long after I had it&lt;br /&gt;The company said they should replace it if I sent it back, why should I have to pack it up&lt;br /&gt;and pay for shipping when their product quit on me. Very dissapointing</li>
    <li> I love that this hair dryer combines ceramic and ionic technology.  I get the best of both worlds at a very reasonable cost.  I am by no means a raging fan of the Twilight series and would prefer that the hair dryer wasn&#x27;t movie themed, but it is a very small price to pay for such a good performing product.  I immediately noticed that my hair was drying faster, with less frizz, and a healthy sheen.  I have very long, wavy hair that gets hit with the blow dryer and straightener on almost a daily basis.  My old hair dryer was taking a noticeable toll on my hair.  After only one use of this dryer, I am able to tell a huge difference.  I also like that it&#x27;s lightweight.  I am extremely please with my purchase and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love it! I wish they made a travel sized one....... I love the color, the price was good too. I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but curly hair, so when my bedhead blowdryer bit the dust I wanted a reasonably priced replacement.  I needed one with both attachments - the diffuser, for when I&#x27;m feeling curls, and the (other piece? what&#x27;s that called?) to help straighten out those curls without causing too much damage, and with the price, this fit the bill.  The &amp;#34;Twilight&amp;#34; theme played no part and while I would have preferred not to have a blowdryer that marketed a teen movie, I got over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blowdryer itself does its job.  Four stars instead of five because it doesn&#x27;t feel super powerful, but it works well, is lightweight and easy to manage, and the attachments similarly do their jobs.  The diffuser is a little smaller than the one I&#x27;d been using, so that is an adjustment, but overall, good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The dryer works like it&#x27;s supposed to but the handle was cracked when I got it and after the 3rd use it cracked more from the heat of the dryer :( It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad but the crack is right at the on/off switch. I guess if you order one be sure to really look close at it before you use it so you can return it if it was damaged in shipping.</li>
    <li> Spouse so far has no complaints and is a nice style and price, Thanks for providing her a nice hair drier to replace the old one that was a dangerous one.</li>
    <li> I had a gift card to Amazon and used it on this item,thinking if&#x27;s it&#x27;s not good-I&#x27;m not losing any money.Well,it is very good.My hair drys in less time and doesn&#x27;t look dried out.It come with 2 attachments to use with it.The heat had different levels,but I only use high,also has different speeds,once again I use high.I have had it about a month and use every other day.I am well pleased with it.Yes I would buy again if needed.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping cost was very reasonable and delivery came as stated.</li>
    <li> I needed a new hair dryer. Badly. I don&#x27;t use straighteners and I had lost the filter cover for my hair dryer. Every time I turned it on, it smelled like dust. When I straightened my hair, it smelled fried. When I dried it wavy, there was no definition in the curls/waves. I am picky about hair dryers - they have to have both the heat concentrating and diffusing attachments. My hair is very frizzy and really hard to control most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;So I searched on Amazon. I knew I didn&#x27;t want a cheap hair dryer but I also didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on one. I found this hair dryer and the attachments are what made me keep reading on it. I like Twilight, though I&#x27;m not a die-hard go-all-out fan. I&#x27;m more of a \\&quot;Twi-half\\&quot; than a \\&quot;Twi-hard.\\&quot; I added this to my wish list and ordered about a month later.&lt;br /&gt;First of all - it&#x27;s really a pretty hair dryer. I like the beautiful shiny finish along with the soft rubber grip. I like how the attachments are matte black and match the soft rubber. The heat is very hot, the cool is very cool and the warm is perfectly in between. I like how the filter cover comes off so you can clean the filter completely.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the important part for me - maintaining my frizz. The last time I straightened my hair with my old hair dryer, it made it more like straw than anything else. The frizz wouldn&#x27;t stay down and my hair kept waving throughout the day, along with the fact that it kept getting stringy. When I dried my hair more wavy, there was no curl definition (as mentioned above) and it was just kinda messy-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer has completely turned that around. I no longer feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair when I blow-dry it (after using frizz serum and heat-protectant spray as always.) When I straighten my hair, it turns out shiny and smooth. I&#x27;ve had co-workers notice my hair looked in better condition.&lt;br /&gt;When I dry my hair wavy/curly with this dryer, there is much more curl definition and much less frizz. I use the diffusing attachment and it takes a while, but my hair just looks to be in much better condition.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this hair-dryer to people who want professional-looking results, to people who are tired of damaging their hair when drying it, and just for anyone who uses a hair dryer vs a straightening iron. It&#x27;s definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product, and returned it for the silver and black Pro one, I think they call it the professional model. It was just about 5 dollars more and well worth the extra. The silver and black one is much quieter which is a very important feature to me in a product that we hold next to our ears.  I recommend going for the other one.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to noticing frizzy hair &amp; being reduced to air drying my hair.  This drys my hair without frizzing it up and has lots of power too.  I use it on the lower settings to further protect my hair.  A great dryer at a good price too</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!! I don&#x27;t know if my old hair dryer was just that bad or if this one is just that awesome but I love this hair dryer. It dries my hair really fast with less frizz and the heat settings are perfect! Gripping this hair dryer is also extremely comfortable and it is very lightweight which makes handling it easy. The Twilight purple thing was more for my daughter but I now fight her for this hair dryer because it does such a great job on my hair. I am now wishing we had purchased two!! (and to be honest the dark purple is pretty)</li>
