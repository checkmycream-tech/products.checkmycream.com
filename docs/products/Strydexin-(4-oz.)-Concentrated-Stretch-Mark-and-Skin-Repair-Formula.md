      <li>Very impressed with the product and the price!</li>
      <li>Will continue to use and hope for the best!</li>
      <li>so I was happy about that.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not too happy to see it for this price</li>
      <li>I too have read these great reviews and so I went ahead and bought myself a bottle.</li>
      <li>but I hope to have good results in the weeks indicating that effect will make me.</li>
      <li>I tried this cream after reading the good reviews and used it on my stretch marks post</li>
      <li>I came across this product after doing some research online and all seemed good with it.</li>
      <li>but i loved the product ......</li>
      <li>I didnt notice a difference, however this does smell very lovely &amp;</li>
      <li>and I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>I honestly lost hope with my stretch marks before this.</li>
      <li>I was kind of a skeptic</li>
      <li>Smells nice, gimmick though.</li>
      <li>But, to be perfectly honest, I don&#x27;t think ANY of these creams work to remove stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Did a great job of significantly improving the texture of my skin so that it feels smooth and supple.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products for my stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Ok so for quite a while now I have been trying to find a cream that would solve my stretch mark issue</li>
      <li>Most did not do anything.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a product designed for everyone&#x27;s condition</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this will indeed help someone else.</li>
      <li>Love this.goes on silky smooth and seeing improvements already</li>
      <li>Exercise, a reasonable diet, and this product are a good combination.</li>
      <li>Super excited!</li>
      <li>Its so great to know that something is actually working for me for once!</li>
      <li>Hoping it lives up to its promises because it wasn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
      <li>Mine were very fresh and pinkish/reddish which might be why it worked well.</li>
      <li>Anyone know if that is true?</li>
      <li>Ere is a very noticeable difference in the area now and my hubby even tells me how much better it looks.</li>
      <li>Amazon u r failing on one of the reasons I used to love you so much...</li>
      <li>I started using it at 5 months pregnant to try to prevent stretch marks on my stomach and now I am 35 weeks and have not gotten any stretch marks on my stomach.</li>
      <li>Especially since it is safe to use DURING pregnancy and nursing!</li>
      <li>It looks to have some pretty good ingredients, as long as you are not oily or acne prone.</li>
      <li>To the person that asked if they could use this on their face, I believe it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product a couple of months after finding out I was pregnant (with my first child).  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice flat shape again.</li>
      <li>I had gained a lot of weight with my first pregnancy.</li>
      <li>I have some stretch marks from weight loss that are pretty unsightly</li>
      <li>my stretch marks tell the only review this product needs :)</li>
      <li>By the end of the first month</li>
      <li>This product started working within the first week.</li>
      <li>I applied it about three times a day for about two weeks and saw remarkable improvement on not only new stretch marks but old ones as well.  </li>
      <li>I have some stretch marks from child birth and have tried most remedies to eliminate them with little success.</li>
      <li>I have been kicking up our workouts to get ready for the summer.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think anything can really do that.</li>
      <li>The marks were so much lighter than before she said.</li>
      <li>This did absolutely nothing for my post pregnancy stretch marks.</li>
      <li>this product is really good....i&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and have noticed a difference in my skin....</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in a long time and am still fine.</li>
      <li>I was sceptical at first but pleasantly surprised in the end.</li>
      <li>I am not on my 21st day and the color is beginning to fade so needless to say I am very happy with this.</li>
      <li>Some are newer and some are older.  </li>
      <li>I have pretty much tried them all over the last six months or so to no avail.</li>
      <li>They are light enough though that I stopped using the bottle before it was done because I was satisfied enough to be lazy about it, haha.</li>
      <li>just when you want to get rid of stretch marks you have to make sure you rub some moisture like oil or cream in everyday &amp; drink alot of water !</li>
      <li>As far as both my fiancé and I are concerned Strydexin is \\&quot;photoshop in a bottle\\&quot;!</li>
      <li>I did not have very high expectations as I think that once stretch marks happen they cannot be eradicated but it did contribute to improving their appearance  with regular use.</li>
      <li>This product did not help with the prevention nor aftermath of my wife&#x27;s stretch marks so far... 5 weeks in</li>
      <li>I think this product works really well to prevent stretch marks and definitely reduces the appearance of stretch marks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a skin care professional and work in a doctors office</li>
      <li>After a year of continuos use, still marked up.</li>
      <li>but if something is good ill pay anything.</li>
      <li>All the working out in the world wasn&#x27;t helping with getting my tummy back to its tight, stretch mark free condition.</li>
      <li>When I was pregnant three years ago I gained so much weight in the last seven weeks that both of my thighs were completely taken over by deep, long, wide purple stretch marks.</li>
      <li>a teen my skin is still young??</li>
      <li>To the person on here that thought these reviews are fake, I try to make my reviews as honest as possible</li>
      <li>the ones that are older, white or gray in color are a lot harder to get rid of.</li>

<li> exactly how it says, my stretch marks are SO bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product helped to manage and reduce stretch marks on my belly and a small cut scar on my face. The results aren&#x27;t instantaneous but nevertheless obvious. I was sceptical at first but pleasantly surprised in the end.</li>
    <li> I too am skeptical of over counter products that claim to be miracles but a friend of mine told me they had some success with strydexin so I bought myself a bottle. I have some stretch marks from weight loss that are pretty unsightly so I applied this cream daily just like it said. The cream dried fast and evenly and did not leave a nasty residue or smell bad so I was happy about that. By the 14th day I started to notice a little lightening of the marks. By the 30th day the marks were still fading. I just recently showed the results to my friend and she said she saw a big difference in the area. The marks were so much lighter than before she said. Its so great to know that something is actually working for me for once!</li>
    <li> I tried this for a few months on my stretch marks from weight lifting. IT DOESN&#x27;T work at all. But, to be perfectly honest, I don&#x27;t think ANY of these creams work to remove stretch marks. I have pretty much tried them all over the last six months or so to no avail.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for my stretch marks. When I was pregnant three years ago I gained so much weight in the last seven weeks that both of my thighs were completely taken over by deep, long, wide purple stretch marks. My OB was kind enough to tell me I had the worst stretch marks she had ever seen in her 20years of practice. I have been using Strydexin for about a month now and my stretch marks are hardly visible! I can actually wear shorts again. I honestly lost hope with my stretch marks before this. I will be referring women to Strydexin all the time. Especially since it is safe to use DURING pregnancy and nursing! I can&#x27;t say enough...my stretch marks tell the only review this product needs :)</li>
    <li> Figured I&#x27;d give it a shot to help with some stretch marks I had from gaining weight, but after two months of use I saw no visible differences.</li>
    <li> Im giving this 3 stars, because I only fully completed 1 bottle,  I didnt notice a difference, however this does smell very lovely &amp; i like how this does need ti be worked in some</li>
    <li> Smells nice, gimmick though. After a year of continuos use, still marked up.</li>
    <li> After just a week of using I noticed a big difference with lighter marks.  Definitely will continue to use this product and recommend to others!</li>
    <li> this product is really good....i&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and have noticed a difference in my skin....it is lighter and the stretch marks appear smaller...will continue to use this product.....wonder what will happen if i use on my face....</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me and I applied it twice a day faithfully for two months.... I didn&#x27;t see any difference, not in the texture or color, nothing!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still testing the product but I hope to have good results in the weeks indicating that effect will make me. thanks</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this product but felt the need to leave a review due to the obviously fake reviews with high ratings. Please be careful when reading reviews. If they seem overly gushy, vague in how the product worked or was used then its most likely a paid reviewer (in-house or freelance).</li>
    <li> I tried this cream after reading the good reviews and used it on my stretch marks post breast aug. I was kind of a skeptic but I actually did notice a big difference after a month or two! The marks aren&#x27;t 100% gone but I don&#x27;t think anything can really do that. They are light enough though that I stopped using the bottle before it was done because I was satisfied enough to be lazy about it, haha. To the person on here that thought these reviews are fake, I try to make my reviews as honest as possible so no one thinks that so I&#x27;ll add a disclaimer....I&#x27;m a skin care professional and work in a doctors office so I do know a few things about stretch marks...the ones that are older, white or gray in color are a lot harder to get rid of. Mine were very fresh and pinkish/reddish which might be why it worked well. I can&#x27;t say if it works on the other kinds because I don&#x27;t know. For stretch marks that are brown, there are tons of products to lighten brown discoloration so if this didn&#x27;t work there is hope in other products.  To the person that asked if they stop using it will the marks come back and darker, I don&#x27;t believe so. I haven&#x27;t used it in a long time and am still fine. To the person that asked if they could use this on their face, I believe it&#x27;s worth a try. It looks to have some pretty good ingredients, as long as you are not oily or acne prone.</li>
    <li> Didnt notice a difference at all, granted I was only applying it once a day.</li>
    <li> Ok so for quite a while now I have been trying to find a cream that would solve my stretch mark issue and I must say FINALLYYYY!!!! I found it! People complain about the price and all that other nonsense but they fail to talk about what the product has done for them.. I took a big risk purchasing this product because none of the reviews proved satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, for anyone considering this product: IT WORKS!! But, of course, it does take time! I have dark purple stretch marks and nothing, I mean nothing, worked... I&#x27;m finally seeing results and I can&#x27;t wait for summer to show off my legs again w/o those ugly lines.</li>
    <li> If you are researching products for stretch marks then this is what you are looking for. This product started working within the first week.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait to use this product for a little bit before writing a review. This product lasted me for about 3 months using it 2 to 3 times a day. I started using it at 5 months pregnant to try to prevent stretch marks on my stomach and now I am 35 weeks and have not gotten any stretch marks on my stomach. I started getting small stretch marks on my thigh and when I started using the cream on them they have almost disappeared and it&#x27;s just been a few days. I think this product works really well to prevent stretch marks and definitely reduces the appearance of stretch marks. I noticed several one star reviews from people who didn&#x27;t even buy the product. But i actually bought it and i just ordered my second bottle because this stuff actually works at least for me.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do a thing. A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference as yet.  Hoping it lives up to its promises because it wasn&#x27;t cheap.  will continue to use.  It rubs in well though and does not stain clothes.</li>
    <li> This product did not help with the prevention nor aftermath of my wife&#x27;s stretch marks so far... 5 weeks in we&#x27;ll see if they improve but I think it&#x27;s a lost cause!</li>
    <li> seems to help reduce marks!</li>
    <li> Directions says apply as needed. No results for the past three weeks, or no sign of improvement! A big waste of money!</li>
    <li> I too have read these great reviews and so I went ahead and bought myself a bottle. I paid $44 so I&#x27;m not too happy to see it for this price but if something is good ill pay anything. I have stretch marks on my waist from the child bearing days and I have tried a lot of remedies to get rid of them but nothing helped. Strydexin was applied to the problems areas twice per day as directed. It took about 2 weeks but I started to see some lighter areas in works and I was thrilled. I keep using for another few weeks and the marks just kept getting lighter. Ere is a very noticeable difference in the area now and my hubby even tells me how much better it looks. I&#x27;m worried if I stop using the cream that the mark will get darker. Anyone know if that is true?</li>
    <li> After doing alot of research I decided to try this out.  I myself was very skeptical of these products.  First off, no stretch mark product is designed to remove the stretch marks which is a common misconception or miscommunication on the part of some.  Strydexin works to fade the stretch marks.  I have all degrees of stretch marks from weight loss. Some are newer and some are older.  The strydexin actually started to work within three days or so.  I applied it about three times a day for about two weeks and saw remarkable improvement on not only new stretch marks but old ones as well.  I decided to stop using the product so I dont waste it while I am continuing to lose weight.  I have never taken the time to review a product before, but this one actually does work.  Very impressed with the product and the price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a couple of months after finding out I was pregnant (with my first child).  I started out with two tiny stretch marks, and after using this product exactly how it says, my stretch marks are SO bad.  This product is making me think that it&#x27;s actually making my strecth marks worse.  I would have never purchased this if I knew then what I know now.  I read the reviews on this product (as I do on everything I order), so I thought it could work for me... NO!</li>
    <li> Strydexin is photoshop in a bottle!  Both my fiancé and I have been kicking up our workouts to get ready for the summer.  Both her and I had noticed a few stretch marks from working out and getting \\&quot;ripped &amp; shredded\\&quot;.  We 1st went to a dermatologist and then a plastic surgeon to discuss what our opinions were to have the stretch marks removed.  Both told us it would cost thousands of dollars.  Since times are tough and money is not growing on trees we decided to try Styrdexin.  We could not believe the results.  Both of our stretch marks vanished.  We were both amazed.  We did not need to spend thousands of dollars.  Not even hundreds.  For well less than a hundred dollars we both were able to erase our nasty stretch marks.  As far as both my fiancé and I are concerned Strydexin is \\&quot;photoshop in a bottle\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Love this.goes on silky smooth and seeing improvements already</li>
    <li> Did a great job of significantly improving the texture of my skin so that it feels smooth and supple. I did not have very high expectations as I think that once stretch marks happen they cannot be eradicated but it did contribute to improving their appearance  with regular use. Exercise, a reasonable diet, and this product are a good combination.</li>
    <li> All these reviews look fake, look at the other products they have also reviewed, a lot of similar adult toys and what not... just seems suspicious. Getting very tired of reading fake reviews... non of them are purchase verified either... Amazon u r failing on one of the reasons I used to love you so much...</li>
    <li> i bought this a couple  months ago wen i said 60 pounds from medicine ! and of course i got stretch marks all on my stomach and breast butt ,legs, thighs everywhere you could get stretch marks at !! i was 115 before i gained weight my tummy was FLAT so i got deep red marks ..well anyways i rubbed this product in twice a day with bio oil also &amp; within 2 months they faded away......... but idk if its cause im a teen my skin is still young?? or cause my family don&#x27;t have stretch marks maybe that plays a roll?? but i loved the product ...... i&#x27;m actually here buying another bottle of it... just when you want to get rid of stretch marks you have to make sure you rub some moisture like oil or cream in everyday &amp; drink alot of water !</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing for my post pregnancy stretch marks. Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have had a few small stretch marks on my stomach ever since I had kids and I have tried everything to get rid of them. Mederma, Mustela, Palmers, Mama Mio, etc. None of them ever provided any lasting results. Most did not do anything. I came across Strydexin in a magazine and figured why not try it. I applied the cream on my stretch marks twice daily just like the directions said. By the end of the second week I thought the color of the marks looked lighter but it was hard to tell since I stared at them everyday. By the end of the first month I def noticed a difference and even my hubby commented. Super excited! Gonna continue to use and see how it goes!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and am starting to see a difference in my stretch marks. I had gained a lot of weight with my first pregnancy. All the working out in the world wasn&#x27;t helping with getting my tummy back to its tight, stretch mark free condition. I tried a few other brands and they just didn&#x27;t work. I am also using the 3D Shaper All over Body Firming and Tightening Cream. After 3 weeks of use, I am starting to see a difference. My stretch marks are definitely lighter and because of the tightening cream, (combined with working out and proper diet) my stomach is starting to get back to it&#x27;s nice flat shape again.</li>
    <li> I have some stretch marks from child birth and have tried most remedies to eliminate them with little success. I came across this product after doing some research online and all seemed good with it. I applied the cream to my stretch marks religiously as the directions said. I went away on vacation and forgot the bottle so I had a week without but I used it for 10 days, stopped for 6 days and than started again. I am not on my 21st day and the color is beginning to fade so needless to say I am very happy with this. Will continue to use and hope for the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a product designed for everyone&#x27;s condition but this wasn&#x27;t for me. It didn&#x27;t improve my stretchmarks at all. but my quest to find something that will, shall continue. I&#x27;m sure this will indeed help someone else.</li>
