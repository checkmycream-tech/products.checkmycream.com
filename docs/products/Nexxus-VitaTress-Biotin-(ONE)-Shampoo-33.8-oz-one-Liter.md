<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If your hair is falling out or thinning then this shampoo along with the vitamin Biotin will really help. I will not use anything but&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo, it&#x27;s great.!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I&#x27;m taking it in combination with a daily Biotin supplement (10,000mcg), which you can find for very cheap on Amazon (around 7 bucks for a bottle of 100). After two weeks of this shampoo and pills, I&#x27;m already growing new hair! This stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> I get this product for my mother and she loves it!</li>
    <li> NEXXUS VITATRESS BIOTIN SHAMPOO IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. I WAS A NIOXIN USER FOR MANY YEARS, THEN THE COMPANY CHANGED IT&#x27;S FORMULA; NO LONGER WORKED FOR ME (DHT BLOCKING COMPOUNDS WERE EVIDENTLY REMOVED OR ALTERED). THEN I FOUND VITATRESS. MY HAIR IS MUCH THICKER, AND MY HAIR REGREW MORE QUICKLY THAN ANTICIPATED. MY ONLY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO CONDITION AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK, BECAUSE THE SHAMPOO AT TIMES CAN BE DRYING.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair really short in November 2010 and it became thinner. I have had this shampoo but hadn&#x27;t used it much. So I decided to give it a long-term try and after about 2 weeks of consistent use, I saw a huge difference in my hair. It was softer, shinier, easier to manage, and noticeably thicker. It has also helped my hair grow a lot (which is what the biotin is for---helps metabolism [hair growth included]) Since November, my hair has grown about 4 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip I would recommend for anyone using this product is to lather it for 30 seconds to a minute, leave it in for 3-5 mins, wash with any temp water. Then apply any general brand of conditioner (i use garnier fructis) only to the tips of your hair (if you apply to the roots, it can clog your pores and defeat the purpose of the shampoo) then wash out the conditioner with cold (not warm or luke warm---COLD) water. It makes your hair so much softer and gradually eliminates and mends split ends (hot/warm water only make split ends worse due to the heat)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never grown so much in such a short period of time nor has it felt so soft or looked so shiny. I am exceptionally pleased with this product and recommend it to anyone who wants healthier, stronger, and longer hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product for years to come! Definitely worth the price considering it last 4-6 months or even more.</li>
    <li> It was packaged good and arrived on time.  The shampoo is very good.  I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Did not grow any hair with this product or any other product I have tried. It is a nice shampoo but did not make a difference. I was mainly interested in trying something with Biotin based on all the good reviews about it. I have also tried these products.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y6NVFM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_81&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Nioxin-System-Cleanser-Scalp-Therapy/dp/B000TMM2PU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1419374838&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;Nioxin+Cleanser%2C+System+2&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VLZHLI/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;I am going to get the Bosley product again. It was the one that I liked the most. I feel they did keep my hair from falling out but did I did not noticed any hair growth. I did a lot of research. I only have a receding hairline with thick hair. I am 32 and have good hair. My brother, 2 years older them me, and my dad are both bald. I am terrified. lol.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo, leave my hair more manageable, but not weighted down.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo, it&#x27;s smell and my hair does fluff up more when I style it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and credit it with keeping my hair.  The 33.8oz bottle is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before so this was a \\&quot;refill\\&quot;. Love the large size with pump! Packaged well and shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and continue to be pleased with results.  It is natural and leaves scalp clean while providing body and manageability to hair.</li>
    <li> My wife has really long hair that was badly damaged due to coloring and heating. I have thinning hair. We bought this, but I must mention that we use the humectress conditioner with it. Hair looks thicker and shinier in two weeks of use. I bought from Amazon and came in good shape. Will buy again. Will also update my hair falling/improvement process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses the Nexus polymeric reconstructor, this shampoo, and humectress conditioner. She styles her hair using Chi thermal protector spray, and now after chronic dead, limp hair, she has gorgeous thick hair. We are also taking vitamins, all the B ones (extra), eating better quality organic home made food and Biosil orthosilic acid. Will report in a couple of months about our progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s hair has recovered due to all these steps. We are in our 30&#x27;s FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair every 2 days, and she does every week. Her hair is to her waist.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to write a thorough review, but I&#x27;ll write what i know. I think my hair is doing better. I&#x27;ve noticed less hair in my brush. Only thing I have to complain about so far is that it doesn&#x27;t lather... which is frustrating. I have to use quite a bit more than I would with a normal shampoo, because it doesn&#x27;t spread well.</li>
    <li> I am a 31 year old, male with thinning hair and some hair loss. I used this product 19 times over the course of 2 1/2 months (11 weeks). My results from use of this product don&#x27;t seem to be typical as in accord with the reviews and the 90% (Amazon Verified) rating. During use I noticed that this product was quite effective at controlling dandruff when used at least twice a week. After using it about a month I started to see that my hair had become a little darker with more &#x27;bounce&#x27; the days following treatment, however, I also noticed the day of treatment that my hair was dried out and a little discolored. Wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal if the hair loss stabilized, however, at two months I observed not less but more hair loss. After analyzing my hair loss before and after treat I confirmed that I actually lost 85% more hair by use of this product! I don&#x27;t know if this is just an initial effect, as I understand sometimes hair products need to be used for 30-90 days to function effectively and a shedding period might take place. However, after 2 1/2 months I couldn&#x27;t do it anymore. I understand that this might not be typical. Maybe this will reverse, if so I will update this in the future. However,  as for me I more than plan to keep searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Expensive for a product that leaves your hair clean but nothing better than less expensive products on the market.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> nothing compares to MillCreek - Biotin Shampoo for the feel. its ok I bet it works i use it then use mill creek right after because it makes my scalp feel rejuvenated</li>
    <li> Have bought this from other places for smaller product and higher price. Itam as described and seems to be working.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and give it a five</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Biotin shampoo for almost a year now and I found it to provide a thorough, gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp and, when used as directed, hair feels stronger, thicker and, of course, clean. I don&#x27;t believe I will be getting back to my my previous brand (Nexxus Therape). While more expensive, the Biotin shampoo appears to be the best for my hair so far - for some background, I have a full head of hair but it&#x27;s in the process of thinning and maybe my forehead advanced by half an inch in the past 10 years :) so I&#x27;m a lot more conscious of what washes my hair now than I was 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotin is part of the VitaTress line of products, designed for those whose hair is in the process of thinning. It is claimed that Biotin eliminates excess sebum, strengthens hair and adds thickness and body to it. I concur with these claims. When use as directed - massage into hair and scalp and let it stay there for THREE MINUTES before rinsing - the hair comes out literally &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27;. It really squeaks if you rub your hand on your wet hair, or it does so for me. There is absolutely no feeling of discomfort while using the shampoo. Once the hair dries, it feels significantly stronger and thicker and it looks healthier and more alive than before the Biotin treatment. The other claim, that this shampoo slows or reverses hair loss I can&#x27;t verify. Maybe I&#x27;ll come back in a year or 2 and discuss share my findings but, as of now, all I can say is that my hair looks and feels better after I wash it with Biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional facts worth sharing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A bottle this size is likely to last for many months so, while the price is high, it&#x27;s not THAT high when spread over 4 to 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;- While it&#x27;s not stated anywhere, it seems to act as a conditioner. I would not use use a conditioner after Biotin myself.&lt;br /&gt;- The &#x27;pump&#x27; bottle is very convenient because it helps you get the proper amount without waste and it prevents water from the shower from diluting the contents.&lt;br /&gt;- For what is worth, the ingredients include: Jojoba oil, Biotin, Cysteine, Inositol and Methionine plus DHT inhibitors.&lt;br /&gt;- Other ingredients include: Ginseng root extract, Ginkgo Bilboa extract, Swertia Japonica extract, Palmaria Palmata extract and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Biotin until I am made aware of a superior product. Until then, I am happy with it.- For what is worth, the ingredients include: Jojoba oil, Biotin, Cysteine, Inositol and Methionine plus DHT inhibitors.  - Other ingredients include: Ginseng root extract, Ginkgo Bilboa extract, Swertia Japonica extract, Palmaria Palmata extract and so forth.

    <li> This is truly an excellent product I have used it for maybe 5 or more years, I was shedding and thinning and it within 2 weeks completely halted any shedding, I have recommended it to my younger brother our friends and everyone is thrilled with it my hair is midway down my back, thick again and I buy this in liters for my house. My husband also loves the shampoo</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo for over a week now and it is everything the description says it is.  Please do yourself a favor and buy this shampoo!!</li>
    <li> Uses often for my thin fragile hair. Definitely has seen a difference in the density since using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I had one cosmetologist tell me that if anything was alive up there (on the top of my head) this would make it grow.  While using Nexxus Vitatress Biotin shampoo, I had another cosmetologist tell me that it would keep what I have from falling out.  I may not have a full head of thick hair on top, but I do have some very fine, thin hair where there was none before. It works for me.</li>
    <li> Daughter felt her hair would be greasy and still falling out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom.  Went home last year and noticed her hair was thinning.  Picked her up two bottles and she swears by it.  Her hair looks much better.  A lot fuller and not falling out as much.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo to help with extreme hair loss going on.  Unfortunately,  my hair loss is from medication for my kidney transplant, and it does not seem to help with that type of hair loss.  I think strong hair growth supplements and vitamins may help better, but I cannot take them.  What I did not like about this shampoo is that it left my hair frizzy, and washed out all my hair color pretty quickly, leaving me with gray hairs all over.  So I just wasted my money, but hopefully this review will help someone else not make the same mistake.  Medication-caused hair loss does not respond so well to some products.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Works well.</li>
    <li> There is a design flaw so you will loose about 10% of the content of the bottle as it slowly drips out after you pump it out. This is an excellent value and despite this downside I still buy the product and use it to cure my paranoia of loosing my hair ....whether it works or not in that regard is anyone&#x27;s guess but it smells excellent so that&#x27;s good enough to be my favorite shampoo.</li>
    <li> have been using Nexus products for many years, just another good one, Hair is thinning&lt;br /&gt;hoping this will help it thicken up</li>
    <li> good product&lt;br /&gt;excellent, healthy&lt;br /&gt;washes well&lt;br /&gt;however, i need to use  a lot of it or wash many times, once is not enough</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and it has been falling out more now that I am 35. This shampoo did nothing for that. My hair still fell out. I feel like it fell out more while I was using it. It also made my hair very dry and ugly. I switched to OGX Biotin &amp; Colagen shampoo and I have less hair in the shower drain now.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo as I was seeing a lot of hair falling out in the shower and whenever I combed/brushed my hair.  I have pretty fine and straight, long hair and always have problems finding products that actually clean my hair and scalp and leave me hair soft with volume.  It has a very pleasant and clean smell and leaves your hair very clean with lots of body, shine and managibility. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because you have to use quite a bit to get a good lather going.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good product that doesn&#x27;t leave buildup on the scalp and does what it says it will, I have seen less hair fall out since using this product.</li>
    <li> I have only used it one month so far and I am also taking Bioting vitamins to help... lots of new hairs coming out so I guess it is working, you do have to use a lot of product to get it going but has not been bad.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, it cleans without leaving a lot of residue but your hair still has moisture to it.  I recommend giving it a try especially if you have dry hair.</li>
    <li> Very happy! Much improvement in shedding locks! One month and amazed!</li>
    <li> this product works great.  My hair stylist recommended it.  This is a great product!  I would recommend.  It should last 1 year!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over 6 months now and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s made much (if any) difference in texture, thickness or in preventing any hair loss. It cleans my hair and it&#x27;s not drying so I guess as far as a shampoo is concerned it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but the effects of using this shampoo was worth talking about. It hasn&#x27;t made my hair greasy and I have already noticed a difference in the fullness of my hair after only a handful of washes. It doesn&#x27;t have an awful smell and I would recommend this shampoo to anyone who is experiencing hair loss or wants to improve the fullness of their hair. My hair is so soft and shiny... I love it!</li>
    <li> Tried for an hour but could not get the pump on this product to work. We bought it because of the pump!  Just another disappointment.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo to do what this shampoo does---not just what it says it can do.  My hair has been color treated for many years and, to me, it did appear to start thinning somewhat down the part line.  I began using this shampoo in conjunction with the Nexxus Biotin scalp cream.  These two products work very well together.  To me, it appears that my part line has been filling in and the hair appears thicker.  I would highly recommend this product and have just purchased 2 more liters.</li>
    <li> Smells is not too obvious, I cannot remember what it smells like, It does its job to clean. I&#x27;m also taking Biotin Gold pills and iron, all combined seem to be working fine together. I have a million new baby hairs.</li>
    <li> Excellent this product is amazing</li>
    <li> Great shampoo . Clean feeling and hair feels so much thicker after a couple of uses. Would recommend to those needing a little life into hair -good for oily to combo hair</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells.  Even my hair stylist has noticed a difference my hair.  She recommends it for her clients.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. My feels and looks thicker. I will continue to use this product. It dries my hair so I use a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Made hair dry, it does the job though.</li>
    <li> its just a regular shampoo no real effects on hair loss after the whole bottle. Revita is still the best.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo paired with Mill Creek Biotin conditioner for the past month or so and there has been a visible difference. My friends and family are commenting that my hair looks thicker and fuller. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the shampoo is the smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is said to be for fine hair. And to leave it on for 3 minutes.  I don&#x27;t have 3 minutes to stand in the shower and count the seconds to 3 minutes.  Once or twice I did and thought this was stupid.  So now I use it alternately with another shampoo which I love and certainly won&#x27;t throw this one away.  How many shampoos do we really need?</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I love it, it really helps my hair!</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo. It lathers well. I like it</li>
    <li> Works very well.  It has delayed any hair thinning.</li>
    <li> Expensive shampoo, and contains sulfates- supposed to aide in hair growth (why it contains biotin) but makes hair straw like and contains sulfates which are bad for the hair.  Supplier shipped promptly and packaged appropriately.  Would not waste your money on this product though. Look for other biotin containing shampoos.</li>
    <li> I loooove this shampoo. It has a gel like consistency that rally leaves my hair and scalp feeling &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34; I also like that it leaves my hair so full of volume. 1 bottle last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair really shiny.  I have been using it for almost a year and my hair is thicker.  Would recommend this for people with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Good product and. Great price</li>
    <li> When I hit my mid to late forties, I began noticing that my hair was thinning a bit and seemed to be losing it&#x27;s softness. I wasn&#x27;t balding, but my hair just didn&#x27;t seem right. I had never really given much thought to the particular shampoos I used (price usually drove my decision), so I decided to try using a number of the \\&quot;more expensive\\&quot; shampoos. Unfortunately, none seemed to really help. I then tried the VitaTress Biotin Shampoo by Nexxus. Wow, what a difference. Within a few weeks, my hair seemed softer again and it felt much thicker. My barber even commented about how thick my hair was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying that this stuff is some miracle cure, or anything, but it really seemed to work for me and for my particular problem. I have been using this for probably 15 years now, and I continue to be very pleased with the results. Two or three times over the years I tried other shampoos, but the brittleness and thinning problem started to return. As soon as I went back to the VitaTress Biotin, though, I saw a significant improvement. I&#x27;m sold and I now buy in large sizes and quantities to make sure I don&#x27;t ever run out. Even take a small bottle with me when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, the stuff can be relatively expensive. In recent years, I&#x27;ve been buying it online and I look for sales before I run too low.</li>
    <li> Love it and this is a great shampoo for thinning hair, doesn&#x27;t have fragrance in it, but worth a product</li>
    <li> Washed my hair with this and it dried it out so bad that when I tried to brush my hair it was ripping my hair out. I had to go to the store and get conditioner and let it soak in. I will never  buy this again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help retain hair, at least not noticeably so. It&#x27;s a good shampoo though. Little drying though</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, went from a bald spot to a not real noticeable thin spot.</li>
    <li> My hair feels thicker and cleaner. Be sure sure that you leave it in your hair for three minutes before rinsing.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fragile hair due to thyroid disease. I have used thus product now for 2 months and I can tell a difference. My hair is softer, and thicker!  This product does not dry out my hair and scalp like other shampoos. If you can get past the smell it really works!! The only bad thing was that the dispenser was broke when I received it. But who cares.</li>
    <li> The product is good, it thikens the hair, but i didn&#x27;t notice any new growing hairs. Fast shipping, good package.</li>
    <li> The product was what I wanted.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about thirty years.  I can&#x27;t see paying salon prices.  It arrived quickly, onetime.  I&#x27;m perfectly happy with the experience.</li>
    <li> I purchased Nexxus Vita Tress Biotin Shampoo because the reviews I saw said it would help with hair loss.  The medication I am taking does cause hair loss and I was hoping this would help with that.  I can&#x27;t see that it has, but it is doing a pretty good job as a shampoo. I will reorder and see if more time will make a difference.</li>
    <li> After my fist hair was my hair felt stronger and i noticed much more body, the breakage STOPPED and it has been a few weeks and my hair has proved to be healthy and I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;I use Nexxus Vita Tress Biotin on my children hair, their hair has less  breakage and a more healthier appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend it for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> awesome shampoo really makes your hair thicker and stronger.</li>
    <li> I really love the shampoo. It works great on my hairs . After the wash , my  hairs feel so soft . Though I feel it&#x27;s a little expensive but worth the price .</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s shampoo. what else can I say?</li>
    <li> Great shampoo it helps to remove sebum and DHT also lasts a long time and is a great value.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I am 30 years old and my hair suddenly started shedding a lot! Way more than normal. I tried pretty much everything I could find. I started searching the web for something and I came across this product. I always liked nexxus products so I gave it a try. It helped almost immediately and my hair looked great? Another plus, the bottle lasts a very long time. Nexxus is amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  After six weeks of using it every time I shampooed my hair quit falling out.  That is all I wanted and that is what I got.  Now I only use it once a week instead of every time I shampoo and it is still keeping the hair on my head and not on the floor.  Just be sure to rinse well and if you have longer hair to use a conditioner afterwards.  It does tend to take the coloring out sooner than my other shampoo, but that is a small price to pay to keep my hair.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love. Prevents breakage and makes hair strong. I would never buy another brand again.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feels squeaky clean.  I would not recommend this shampoo.  It&#x27;s too expensive for what it does; not worth it.</li>
    <li> Stopped using Biotin several years ago for another  brand because of the cost.  But believe me Biotin is worth the cost.  My thinning hair looks fuller.  This is something that I was not able to have with the other shampoos I used.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel great and looks shiny but it&#x27;s too early to tell if it does anything for hair growth.  My doctor told me that you have to take biotin and folic acid for at least 6 months before you will see any change in your hair, skin or nails so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything within a month.  I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I had bought the 10 oz bottle maybe 4 months ago and since I liked it so much, I knew I would have a good investment if I went to the liter size bottle.  My hair is fine and thin on the top for a female in her early 30&#x27;s which makes me self conscious sometimes.  I think this shampoo has helped with making my hair fuller, but not necessarily making new growth or feel thicker.  I leave the shampoo in for 3 minutes, wash out, then follow with Nexxus Thickening Leave-In Conditioner.  I think the combination helps not to leave my hair too heavy compared to a regular &#x27;wash out&#x27; conditioner.</li>
    <li> Paired with the scalp creme, I&#x27;ve seen my receding hairline slow (maybe for good!?). I like the smell and a little bit works up a good lather. I tried a few other shampoos before settling on this one, and don&#x27;t foresee any reason I might switch.</li>
    <li> My son loves this shampoo and will never use another product&lt;br /&gt;he feels his hair is stronger and getting thicker using this item</li>
    <li> Honestly i thought it wouldn&#x27;t work but i still tried it, and after about the 5th time i used it i coud feel the big difference, my scalp felt refreshed, and my hair started growing real fast. I am so obsessed with this shampoo and i am on my third bottle already and it has made a big difference. I would recommend it. But make sure you use conditioner after or your hair may feel dry, other than that loved it!</li>
    <li> I am on medicine for a brain tumor that causes hair loss.  Depakote is the medicine and this product helped with the hair loss. Your hair and scalp feel cleen and nourished.  I will always use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> It doesnt lather well but reduces hair fall</li>
    <li> Great smelling and good shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t necessarily help with hair growth however.</li>
    <li> I believe this shampoo does what it says it does. I feel my hair thicker and stronger by using this shampoo</li>
    <li> Coupled with Bioten tabs, was able to get hair back after botched surgery and complications for anesthesia.</li>
    <li> seems to work well...hair appears to have gotten thicker, my roots are still kind of thin though :\</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a few days now... but it seems to be working fairly well. My hair does seem thicker, and the smell it provides is FANTASTIC. Love it.</li>
    <li> I think the shampoo is good for my hair, but I have a problem with the fact that it takes a lot of shampoo to create a lather.  This means I&#x27;m using more shampoo than other shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Comes out gelatinous so that when you go to lather it just slips out of your hand. It is incredibly drying which isn&#x27;t too suprising since it does contain sulfates. I also find that I have to wash my hair twice when using this product because it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove build-up. I know that there are no miracle thickening shampoos out there and I haven&#x27;t given it the time to judge it on that point but I really just hate the composition of this shampoo. I will probably go back to using Pura D&#x27;or which also didn&#x27;t miraculously thicken my hair but it didn&#x27;t dry it out and I was able to get the shampoo from the bottle to my head.</li>
    <li> I have super fine, wavy, long hair that tangles really easy. I was hoping to find a 2-in-1 shampoo that would help with my hair type. This shampoo cleans well. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it does what it claims, but I personally don&#x27;t feel like it conditions my hair at all. In fact, my hair is even more tangled when I get out of the shower after I use this, so I have been using a leave-in conditioner- which is fine, but I&#x27;m really one of those wash, brush, and go people- the less I have to do in my morning routine, the better. Also, I find that conditioner really weighs down my hair and makes it feel greasy. If you have fine hair that tangles really easily and you don&#x27;t want to have to condition your hair, then this might not be for you.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this shampoo.  It works great for problem thinning hair.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good product, works great, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the purchase, I recommend it to everyone I hope that works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and I can see less hair falling out. I also use the conditioner . I also take viviscal vitamin and it has all worked together for my hair that was falling out, i believe due to menopause or stress one.</li>
    <li> It was a good shampoo but I just didn&#x27;t notice  a difference from other reg shampoos.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair really tangled so if it does improve hair growth you can not tell because you pull it out trying to untangle it !!!!</li>
    <li> Other reviews about the smell are absolutely spot on.  Terrible, unendurable!!  It is so bad that instead of shampooing with it again I just had my hair cut short.  Nothing is worth having that smell in my hair.  I have since tried Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi wild ginger shampoo which smells absolutely devine imo.&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensitive to smells at all, I wouldn&#x27;t try this... save yourself the time, money, and frustration when you realize they were right all along.  :)</li>
    <li> I have never had dandruff in my adult life...this shampoo totally dried out my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 23 years and and have been diagnosed with hypothyroid and have been losing my hair by the handfuls. My hair has been thinning up to a point my scalp is visible! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now and all I can say is wow! My hair feels amazing when running my hands through it as before it felt like straw. Now it feels light and fluffy like feathers! I&#x27;ve been running my hands through it non stop since using this shampoo (I can&#x27;t help it) and noticed a decrease in the amount falling out. Some still do but much much less! I have so much volume you can&#x27;t see my scalp! Definitely a great confidence boost since a girls hair is precious to her!</li>
    <li> this made my hair feel very thick.  i liked it.  the only drawback is that it not last very long, like i don&#x27;t know if it was old shampoo and it just didn&#x27;t make my hair that thick anymore.</li>
    <li> I am rather impressed with this shampoo.  It cleans well, smells good and leaves my hair feeling fuller and bouncier.  It seems to have slowed down the amount of hair loss that I was experiencing.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 is because the pump was broken whenever I received it in the mail and shampoo had leaked out into the package causing a mess.  Other than that, I am well pleased with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> The VitaTress Biotin line of products is the best that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Using this shampoo with Nexxus&#x27; ProMend conditioner has vastly improved the quality and condition of my hair. I&#x27;d recommend following the directions on the bottle and leaving this set after a good scrub for no less than three minutes. I lost a bit of weight quite rapidly so my hair started thinning out just a bit. This has stopped that completely and makes my hair look full, smell great, and feel clean all the time. The amount of shampoo in each bottle is most definitely worth the price (buying this from a drugstore or place like Target/Walmart is going to cost you around $5 - $10 more). I&#x27;d say my only complaint was a very minimal amount of leakage from the bottle upon receipt. However, it was wrapped in its own individual plastic bag so it didn&#x27;t leak on other products it was shipped with. I think I&#x27;ll continue buying this particular shampoo for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Local salon told me it was a salon only product----and charged me  accordingly.  This is great shampoo; highly recommend this product for fine, thinning hair.  Even makes your face fell like  you used an expensive  facial wash. Shipped on time.  I had a better price in my cart, but waited too long and the seller rescinded the offer----(Sold Out?)  So, when you get a real good deal,  go ahead and Buy it Now!  Learned my lesson.  This  deal was OK and cheaper than the salon.  Try the shampoo-----best ever for me.</li>
    <li> I am in love with shampoo my hair feels great after use I been using it for 4 days now and I have no complaints about it and I love the smell as well I strongly recmomded buying this shampoo it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
    <li> Shampoo seems nice. I can&#x27;t really tell that the shampoo works great. I purchased this along with Humectress and that product works very well. I do appreciated the pump dispenser. It&#x27; s user friendly.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo for about  1 1/2 months and gave seen very little change in my hair and you need to add conditioner to your hair because it gets tangled after shampooing</li>
    <li> i purchased this shampoo about a week and a half ago and been using it every other day and every time i put it on i can already feel the good quality, if you have thin hair like me, your hair will feel silky, and well after your hair drys you will be able to tell the difference. I feel my hair bouncy and I am very happy about my purchase i cant wait until it grows :D</li>
    <li> My hair is full of body and healthy. Along with taking the Biotin supplement from Wow, I am very pleased. Will reorder this product!</li>
    <li> Dont trust in that PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL LOSE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for strengthening hair. Great price</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after reading all good reviews. I usually don&#x27;t use shampoos with Sulfate, but this has other good ingredients too so I bought it. It&#x27;s a big size bottle at a good price. I have thinning hair and wanted something that will help in growing some new hair. I have been using it only for month and half and can&#x27;t see any growht yet. It&#x27;s too early to tell. I&#x27;ll give it six months and see what happens. It does dry my otherwise somewhat oily hair. I&#x27;ll write another review if I see any new growth in my hair. I wash my hair twice a week.</li>
    <li> First time I used a product that does what it says!</li>
    <li> Both bottles I bought leaked</li>
    <li> Super item for the money.</li>
    <li> this shampoo really cleans your hair. Not just clean but CLEAN. I can&#x27;t explain it, you have to feel it. It removed all the gel and built up dander on my husbands hair and works great on all hair types. I use it and have straight hair and my husband has curly. The bottle is large so i think the price is well worth it for its quality. The top is easy to come out, and sprays a good amount. Only a small amount is needed. we showere everyday and over half of the bottle is left after two months.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works to help improve hair growth.  I hope this product never comes off the market.  So are it is still easy to get.</li>
    <li> Great product,highly recommend . Great for my hair</li>
    <li> My hair use to fall out like crazy after styling it every morning. A wad would go to the floor and I&#x27;d clean it up. After using Vitatress for about 2 or 3 weeks, I noticed I see very few strands on the floor after styling.  I started adding Biotin vitamin to my daily routine (but I think the shampoo alone is fine). My coworker recommended the vitamin and said it has made her hair grow longer than it usually would. I&#x27;m taking 2300 mcg. She&#x27;s taking 1000 mcg because she said the higher the dosage may cause headaches. A guy on YouTube said he used 5000 mcg and noticed hair growth back in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of Vitatress is awful at first (smells like cough syrup), but once you wash it in your hair, it starts to smell nice. I am getting used to the smell now. You&#x27;ll definitely need a conditioner afterwards to bring back the silky feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dandruff issue and was on Head &amp; Shoulders for life. I also wash my hair daily as it tends to get oily at the top, but very dry at the bottom. Using Vitatress hasn&#x27;t brought back my dandruff. I do try to use Head and Shoulders at least once a week just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Nioxin before and it worked for awhile, then stopped working. It&#x27;s also very expensive. I would recommend Vitatress more.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for my hair.  I usually wet my hair before getting in the shower and massage this shampoo in and let it sit on my head for 10 to 15 minutes before I jump in the shower. So far my hair is fuller and thicker after a month of using.  I have not had any negative affects using this product at this point.  I recommend.  My hair is also shiny.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product before but only had a sample pack of it which I ran out of.  I could not find it to buy it.  I would recommend this to anyone who has thin hair strands or missing hair.  It works!!  It conditions the hair everytime you use it.  Your hair feels fuller.</li>
    <li> This biotin shampoo cleans my hair AND reduces scalp itch from seborrhea.</li>
    <li> This really is amazing shampoo.  My hair always feels healthier and fuller when using it.  Some suggest that you don&#x27;t need conditioner with this product.  This might be true with soft water or for occasional use, but for the most part, conditioner is still necessary in my opinion. I only wish they made a conditioner in this product line however.</li>
    <li> I was noticing a lot more hair in the drain.  Having already fine hair (a fair bit of it, but it&#x27;s been fine ever since I lost a lot of it and it grew back fine after a major surgery 7 years ago), I freaked out a bit.  I was already taking a lot of biotin, and I ruled out other causes (thyroid, iron, protein) in labs, and finally decided to buy this stuff and give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this - within a week it slowed the hair loss considerably.  I no longer had the drain filling with hair after every shower.  This bottle is huge and lasted me a long time.  I finally just ran out, and sure enough, ~2 weeks later, and I&#x27;m noticing more hair loss - not a terribly concerning amount this time, but more nonetheless, so I guess I&#x27;m going to have to bite the bullet and go back to using this stuff again!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind this as a regular shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t give me the results it claimed to. My hair is thinning in the front, I used the entire bottle and haven&#x27;t seen any difference. The bottle is huge and lasted me a good few months; I have long thicker hair. The consistency is different from regular shampoos; it seems thinner and doesn&#x27;t really lather unless you massage the heck out of your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for the results it claims to give.</li>
    <li> so  far so good I like how my hair feels and looks after I used it, my hair looks fuller, and healtier.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair good body and gets it really clean without stripping it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Product....will buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is really slowing my hair loss, or not, but I do really like what it does for my hair. Some people tried this product, and didn&#x27;t like it for their hair, though. I think everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and you have to find what works best for yours. I had previously used Nioxin System 6 shampoo and is seemed to work to reduce my hair loss, but then it stopped working, so I tried this. I really like the texture and strength of my hair with this product. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a year now, and the longer I use it, the better the strength and texture of my hair. The only problem is that my hair loss has gotten worse in the past couple of months. I decided to try the Nioxin again, and my hair hates it. with just one washing, my hair is like straw. I&#x27;m going to have to get the Nexxux Vitatress again. I got some Rogaine to see if that help slow the hair loss, and regrow my hair. My hair likes this, so I&#x27;m going to stick with it. I do have to say that I like the Nioxin conditioner, though.</li>
    <li> Good delivery time works well with my hair</li>
    <li> Original, very good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but it does make my hair appear thicker. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, really works well and does what it claims to do.  A large bottle will last for months so its really not much more than the less expensive common brands which often come in smaller bottles.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find ! Excellint price !</li>
    <li> I purchased a couple of these because it was a great deal. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost 2 months and I love it! I have very thin, flat hair and I have purchased many other &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; shampoos or shampoos for fine/thinning hair from various brands (Bumble &amp; Bumble, Carol&#x27;s Daughter, etc.) and this shampoo has been a miracle. Since I started using it I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less fall out during showers (I used to have an alarming amount fall out), and it gives my hair natural volume without any other product. It does take a little effort to get a good lather, but it works great! Will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> This shampoo will restore your hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo</li>
    <li> This is my second order. It is a remarkable product at a reasonable price. This size lasts 6 months and I shampoo every other day. I appreciate a good value and this saves adding small size plastic bottles to landfills. I wish shampoo mfg offered refill pouches like laundry products.</li>
    <li> my hair was falling out and since I stared using this shampoo I feel its not falling out and it has volume, growth and shine. I highly recommemd this product its great also its not overpriced</li>
    <li> I have 3b/c Hair it is extremely kinky and shrinks. Now i know the ingredients in this shampoo do contain sulfate but I am going natural but believe that dryness can be combated with your follow up conditioning steps for afro-textured hair. Some may disagree but I loved this product in the past and it gave me growth and cuticle strength I was able to retain my waist length hair for years. The bottle will last forever and shipping was fast and efficient. I do not use this product for its intended hair loss use, mainly for the biotin and strengthening. I will use on my whole hair or just lather my scalp only with this shampoo daily for cleansing my hair. Dont be afriad to try it out and alter to what may work for you its great and smells yummy. The liquid is clear it kinda adds to clean fresh feeling. Also be careful when rinsing out this product because of its strenthening and nutrients enriched it will leave the hair hard feeling, you can feel the strength once it was coated. Follow up immediately with moustirizing conditioner and I lit mine sit for easy detangling later on.</li>
    <li> After using it twice i have noticed my hair not falling as much and i also use the #2 scalp creme, it feels minty and softens your hair.</li>
