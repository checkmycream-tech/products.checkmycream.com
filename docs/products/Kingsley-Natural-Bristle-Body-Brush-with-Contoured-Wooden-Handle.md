<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Feels great on the skin</li>
    <li> Great brush for Dry Brushing</li>
    <li> Love this natural brush and it feels great! I have noticed an improvement of cellulite... I just need to remember to use it daily!</li>
    <li> The bristles are not too soft and not to hard for dry brushing. The angle of the handle is great for hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of stiffness to the bristles. Soft enough to use on one&#x27;s face but stiff enough to give a good scrub. I have been buying these for years.</li>
    <li> This said it was made of natural bristles but it seemed very synthetic.  Other than that, it worked out, but the bristles felt a little harsh.  I would probably find a different brand and pay a little more for a higher quality next time.</li>
    <li> Great price..well made but too harsh for my skin. Instead use it on feet - wonderful!</li>
    <li> Much nicer and larger than expected. completely changed my skin health! I will never look back after this. There is no cream or anything ive ever used that improved my skin this much!</li>
    <li> This makes your massage experience that much better.  So awesome. I was at a spa recently and the gal used this on me.  I have been to probably 15 different Spas and this was the first time I had been brushed.  I asked what on earth she was doing as it felt so amazing.  She started my massage with about 10 min. of Brushing.  Some might think that is a waste of time but it was HEAVEN.  She said it wakes up the body and helps it receive the massage better. Boy was she right!  I ended up coming home and ordering one the same day so that when hubby gives me a massage he can do the same thing prior to his massages on me.  you just simply brush the limbs and back...all starting furthest from the heart and go towards the heart.....each limb probably 50 times.......she did it fairly fast.....and about 50 times on my back.....she might have done each limb in sections.  You will love it.  Do it when the skin is dry and free of oil.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are much harder than I expected - really scratchy and borderline painful.  I was replacing one that I had for years that finally broke.  They look the same, but this one is inferior in every way.  I won&#x27;t be using it and no do not recommend it for dry brushing.</li>
    <li> does what its supposed to.</li>
    <li> Works well as a body brush not too rough.  Only downside made in China.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot.  But handle a little shorter than I would have liked so I can easily do my entire back. That&#x27;s on me, though, for not paying attention to exact measurement.</li>
    <li> Great for dry brushing pre-shower</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, and I like the one that I purchased from you.  I love the product, and will reorder when this one wears out</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for to dry brush my skin.  It is rough but not too rough.  Just the right feel for dry brushing.</li>
    <li> decent brush for the price</li>
    <li> The is a nice bath brush.  The bristles are holding up well.  The bristles though are a bit soft but still nice,</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the body brush, other than I feel awkward with the handle. However, the brush works well, I just have to get used to it. I am pleased by the manufacturing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for use to aid in washing my back while showering. At first it was good, not overly stiff and the handle just adequate for my needs. It&#x27;s worth noting that while the handle is wood, the bristles are attached to a plastic oval which is then attached to the wood. After a few weeks the plastic began to crack along the edges. Initially I thought it was just bristles stuck under the plastic but realized it was actually cracks. They eventually got worse and the plastic broke off. I&#x27;d suggest looking for a brush where the bristles are attached directly to the wood.</li>
    <li> This s*** hurts. It isn&#x27;t good for dry brushing my skin like I hoped, it just scratches the crap out of it. It would probably be a good cleaning brush for shower walls.</li>
    <li> Great brush, love the handle. It makes it easier to use. Have not experienced any bristles falling out at all.</li>
    <li> For dry skin-brushing, this is my favorite. The curved, short handle makes it easier to wield than the long, straight handles of brushes sold locally. The bristles are the perfect median between overly soft and over-rigid. They are perfect for gentle, adequate skin brushing. It has a solid construction. The wood feels good quality: really smooth and plenty hefty.    To clean it, I always run a wide-toothed comb through it after use. Sometimes I spray it with Thieves Oil and leave it in the open air. It can be washed with soap and water, then left to dry in the sun. Someone else wrote that she discards hers every 3 months. They last so well, it seems like a shame but I can see her point.    This is my second one. I have had my first one several years. It&#x27;s in very good shape.    P.S. I wonder if left-handed people would dislike the curved handle.</li>
    <li> this brush is for &#x27;dry brushing&#x27; your body before...before, showers. Someone complained that it didn&#x27;t hold up in the shower. Well, it&#x27;s a DRY BODY Brush. I love it, and mine is holding up terrific. Love it</li>
    <li> I would say that I have sensitive skin, not so much to like creams and other topical products but more to touch and the sun, and this brush feels great. I was a little worried that it would be too harsh. I use it for dry brushing before the shower and it feels great! Not too harsh at all.</li>
    <li> i like it. it reaches my upper back which is why i got the one with the handle. my problem is that i brush too hard but that&#x27;s not the brush&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> ergonomical-handle is wood solid smooth. Bristles are hard perfect for dry skin brushing!</li>
    <li> Terrible brush.  Bristles are very short.  When scrubbing, it feels like you are using the wood with short bristles.  Not happy with this product.  Tried the Kent Body Brush.  Much better!</li>
    <li> I needed a good dry brush to get my skin vacation ready and after reading the reviews and the great price chose this one. Perfect size and shape and the bristles are just the right amount of firmness and did not irritate my skin. Would definetly buy again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long but it seems to be holding up better than my last sisal brush.  Not too harsh on the skin, angle is nice to reach places on the back.</li>
    <li> This brush would not be a bad product if more attention would have been paid to its quality. The finish on the wood is rapidly disappearing and the bristles are looking old and tired. The edges of the wood could have received a more generous radius to fit the hand more comfortably. While I know it&#x27;s just a brush, but it could have been executed better. There must be better brushes out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this much softer version of a dry body brush. The one I ordered prior to this was just too painful for me. If you have sensitive skin, this is the brush for you.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, exactly what I wanted! Good length for getting those difficult areas without going to a full sized back brush. Quality seems good so far, but we&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> These bristles were strong enough to get a nice glow from the dry skin brushing but not so harsh as to be uncomfortable as I have experienced with other vegetable brush style skin brushes.  I use it every day as a part of my morning routine.  I feel as though it helps my circulation and my lymphatics.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and great price.</li>
    <li> Good quality body brush. Doesn&#x27;t seem to fall apart like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The paddle is largely curved and contours nicely in my grip. The bummer was that Amazon took forever to ship. I waited over two weeks to get this item.</li>
    <li> Purchased this on the recommendation from our doctor to use a natural boar brush and hibiclense to help with my 6-year-old&#x27;s severe follicultis.  She had sores on her bottom for months. After using the antibiotic cream prescribed by her doc, we began using the brush on her trouble areas. The folliculitis has not returned! I am very pleased with the quality. She complains that it is too rough, however, when I used it it was fine, not painful at all. She is able to tolerate it, though. I was having problems with skin infections as well, and since using the brush I haven&#x27;t had any issues. I highly recommend this for people with folliculitis!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for dry brushing my legs. The bristles are very soft, maybe too soft. I did not see any noticeable difference after using. It isn&#x27;t worth returning in the trash it went.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever body brush.  It actually seems a bit &amp;#34;sharper&amp;#34; than I expected and some of the other reviews say the opposite.  The bristles are all pushed to one side (not sure if that was intended or a packing glitch), but if I move it the opposite way, it hurts certain areas of my body!!!  The handle is nice for the back!</li>
    <li> This is the first dry brush I&#x27;ve purchased, and it was exactly what I was looking for!  The contoured handle makes the process very comfortable, and the stiffness of the bristles is perfect.  Not too tough on my skin, but still very invigorating.  I&#x27;ve had no trouble with shedding bristles at all.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, had one for many years before. This one has been upgraded from the old model from years gone by. Holds soap very well &amp; rinses clean without much effort. Try One or Two!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. It is the perfect size for her.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  The bristles stand up through dry and wet body brushing.</li>
    <li> I just got this and it seems like a good, sturdy brush with a wide surface.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet so will keep you posted on the longevity.  My teen son and husband wash their feet a lot in the tub during the summer months, so they will give it a good test!</li>
    <li> This is my first body brush so I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re supposed to feel, but brushing my skin with this is very painful and not pleasant at all. It has become a toy for my kids because none of us like it on our skin.</li>
    <li> I like this brush, it handles very well and I prefer it to larger longer brushes. However, the bristles are not as firm as I&#x27;d like them to be.</li>
    <li> If you are consistent with dry brushing you will see results.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for it&#x27;s handle. It&#x27;s gentle and works well, but I find myself using another one I have that has longer bristles.</li>
    <li> I mostly like this brush, the curved handle is nice and the bristles a good strength. I did notice tho that initially quite a few bristles fell out and pulled out easily.</li>
    <li> The bristles are firm enough to be effective but not painful.</li>
    <li> Holding this while using it to wash someone else is unpleasant.  It hurts my hand.</li>
    <li> Bristles didn&#x27;t hold up very well, became matted down and lost effectiveness. Don&#x27;t recommend it for bathing or any actual scrubbing, but I can see how it would work for dry brushing.</li>
    <li> this product smells like it&#x27;s been dipped in formaldehyde what the hell? disgusting disgusting disgusting when people are going to put stuff on there body you don&#x27;t dip it in chemicals get a clue!</li>
    <li> Based upon the description, this sounds like an excellent natural brush for dry brushing your skin. However, when it arrived, I felt the bristles and they are nowhere near firm enough for proper dry brushing. This might work great if you need a shower scrubber or something like that but DO NOT buy this as a skin dry brush!!! It costs almost as much to ship it back as it originally cost me, so I guess I&#x27;ll just be the proud owner of a plastic bag-covered, smooshy-bristled brush. Oh well!</li>
    <li> The brush design is great, however, the brush itself isn&#x27;t very good. After a few uses the brush became hard on the tip ( feels like the brissels are tangled).</li>
    <li> This is a great, basic brush for dry brushing.  The handle is long enough to get hard-to-reach places on your back, yet not too long to be cumbersome.  Perfect little brush!</li>
    <li> It is very sturdy. The shape makes it very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush and I tried to use it wet and scrub my arm. I got allergy and it feels itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will just use this brush to brush the dust on my clothes.</li>
    <li> This a great brush for dry brushing the skin. My skin was softer just after three days. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> easy to hold with nice firm bristles. feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> The brush part is fine. It&#x27;s clear that the designer has not used one of his products, because the thin, flat wooden handle is NOT ergonomic. It&#x27;s so thin it&#x27;s very difficult to hold on to with soapy hands - almost unusable.  The handle needs to be much thicker, say one inch, with a texture to prevent it from slipping. I&#x27;m going to build-up the thickness and shape it as it should have been. It&#x27;s not worth sending it back for a refund. Good brush; very bad execution.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for dry brushing and the handle makes it easy to reach those spots and to use.</li>
    <li> fell apart within two months - poorly made</li>
    <li> I bought this for dry skin brushing and it works well. I keep it hanging in the shower so sometimes it gets a little wet, and I&#x27;ve noticed an odd smell given off by the bristles.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush, though it sheds some.  Seriously hoping it doesn&#x27;t lose too many too quickly.</li>
    <li> I remodeled my bathroom and decided to replace everything in the process. It is wonderful to have everything new in the room.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple brush for dry skin brushing, and this one is excellent. The bristles are sturdy but not too harsh, and the handle is designed comfortably for brushing hard-to-reach places. Love it!</li>
    <li> Got one of these for myself and the boyfriend. We both love it. The bristles are just rigid enough and the grip is just the right size.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for dry brushing before showers and it seems to be doing a great job. The brush construction is simple, the natural bristles are anchored into a plastic bed which is attached to the wooden body with nails.  If you&#x27;re hypersensitive to aesthetics, I suppose the visible nails could bother you, but they don&#x27;t affect the use of the brush at all and you certainly can&#x27;t feel them.  The curve of the sturdy handle is nice and it&#x27;s just long enough for me to reach everywhere I need without having to bend in crazy positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles (what I think is the most important part) are a little firmer than I expected, but I had never dry brushed before.  I&#x27;m used to the super soft facial brushes that are made for delicate skin. This brush is definitely not that, but it&#x27;s not supposed to be.  These bristles are firm and do a great job of loosening dry skin and getting circulation started.  My legs are painfully white and typically very dry, moisturized or not, but since I&#x27;ve been dry brushing for the last few weeks they&#x27;ve smoothed out quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in a visible place (because I have a terrible memory) and dry brush pretty much everything, sans face and neck of course, in long strokes towards my heart/stomach before every shower with deliberate, but not crazy harsh, strokes.  After the shower, I make sure to moisturize my legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a miracle cure for bumps, cellulite, and unevenness? Not for me, but it has been an excellent tool to make my moisturizer far more effective and that has been well worth.  My skin is smoother and my moisturizer actually does it&#x27;s job now that it&#x27;s not competing with a (excuse the grossness) layer of dead skin.</li>
    <li> The brush feels good on my skin. I brush my entire body after my shower. It help with my cellulite.</li>
    <li> Kingsley natural bristle body brush works great &amp; is a 100% natural brush which I love. I dry brush my skin.</li>
    <li> I am JUST starting to dry brush and this brush is working very well. It isn&#x27;t too soft nor too stiff and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> It shed quite a few bristles the first couple of uses but now it&#x27;s fine.  I use it for dry brushing and it feels great on the skin. I also love the shape and size of the handle; the brush is very manageable.</li>
    <li> Nice size and shape also, the bristle are neither too soft or too hard.  I am old and tender and need to work up to torturous hard bristles for dry brushing.  Good pricing</li>
    <li> The bristles are softer than any other boar&#x27;s hair brush I&#x27;ve gotten but they will definitely do the job of dry skin brushing or using the brush in the shower. The contour handle provides ease with use. Very nice brush.</li>
    <li> The brush works good.</li>
    <li> Short, firm bristles take a little getting used to on sensitive areas like my torso, but its great to be able to scrub my entire back and feel clean all over :)  The brush is holding up good enough in the shower, but will need to be replaced before too long.</li>
    <li> I like the size and and the ergonomic handle but the bristles feel like they are made of stainless steel on the skin. I use it very gingerly and slowly….</li>
    <li> Has helped transform my skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Had one of these for many years till I finally wore the bristles off.  Love the perfect curve for back scrubbing.  Beautifully made!</li>
    <li> Too soft and the bristles come out from the first use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. It&#x27;s small enough to handle and get to those spots that need extra brushing. I kinda wish the bristles were a little harder, but it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> I stopped looking for any other bath brush when I found this one. Its fits perfectly in my hand and is easy to use. And I love the way it takes off the old skin cells. It leaves me feeling really clean.</li>
    <li> Loved the brush, but returned it as it had defect and bristles fell out within a week! So I bought the same brush again, and it lasted a while, but again bristles fell out.</li>
    <li> wanted a longer handle to reach my back bursh is ok</li>
    <li> I read all the wonderful reviews on this brush but the one I ordered which I have used 4 times I just noticed all the bristles are flat</li>
    <li> I originally purchased to try as a dry brush, but ended up using it the shower on my body then face (it takes a few minutes to soften up enough to be comfortable on the face). I really enjoy it. The bristles are invigorating and have made a huge improvement in smoothness and even makes my face look younger. Exfoliation is one of the best beauty secrets. The handle is also comfortable.</li>
    <li> I honestly expected this brush to be a bit smaller. It fits perfectly in my hand and covers large areas, like the legs and arms, very well. I have yet to dry brush with this product, as my skin is very sensitive. I&#x27;ve tried it in the shower though, and it leaves my skin feeling great! I feel energized whenever I use this brush. The bristles are neither too soft or too rough. It&#x27;s the best body brush I&#x27;ve owned yet!</li>
    <li> I got this because I read how beneficial body brushing can be in one of Marilu Henner&#x27;s books. It really is nice and the brush is a great quality, sturdy item.</li>
    <li> After hearing much about how body brushing promotes general health and contributes to skin toning during weight loss, I purchased this brush and have been very happy with it. It has had positive effects on my skin, and has indeed helped with toning. I would recommend this brush to anyone looking for a quality natural-bristle product!</li>
    <li> I wanted a relatively small and easy to hold body brush. This fits the bill perfectly. The angle of the handle makes maintaining long strokes on arms and legs very easy. The bristles are a bit too stiff at first but softened very quickly after just a couple of uses. The brush has held up well over time and even to the abuse of the three year old using for everything expo it&#x27;s intended purpose 😉</li>
    <li> awesome feel and size - perfect for face and neck cleaning</li>
    <li> The brush end is good and I like the curved angle of the head but only if the handle was a leetle beet longer it&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of indifferent. It is a body brush. It is a little rough so I would only recommend that you use it for the lower part of your body.</li>
    <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This brush is great!! It is soft enough that I can use it everywhere but tough enough to really get my dry skin off. I like the handle, it allows me to hold the head of the brush while I brush my legs, but then use the handle when I need to get my back. I use this in conjunction with a sea wool sponge and my skin is glowing. I love it, and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this daily after a year.  Easier to use than one with a long handle.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush that is not too hard or too soft.  Just right.  Great quality and the shape makes it easy to use all over.</li>
    <li> The soft bristles feel wonderful, and I&#x27;ve been careful to bring the shower brush out of the moist air in order to keep the mildew action from happening. Loving this so far!</li>
    <li> Now a quick warning is that it is a bit rough, however if you can get past that it&#x27;s great! My back and chest have cleared up substantially since using this! I didn&#x27;t realize that clothes and scrubbies just weren&#x27;t getting all the stuff off but this brush definitely did the job!</li>
    <li> Good body brush for &#x27;dry body brushing&#x27;. Firm bristles but not too hard that it leaves terrible red marks. I decided to purchase this brush because I had read about dry body brushing and wanted to try it. I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush and I know it will last a long time, it appears to be very well made.</li>
    <li> its a ok brush, for the money but really meant for right handed people. Also the handle could be a little longer, to reach the middle back and bush itself could be a little more stiff,</li>
    <li> Great brush..hard at first but it&#x27;ll soften when in the shower</li>
    <li> One of my girlfriends raving about how much dry brushing her legs has impacted her life. Going on about the health benefits of proper circulation, how she can fit into her jeans easier, etc.  After months of hearing about her changes I finally got a dry brush for myself. This is a great beginner brush and would recommend this handled brush rather than a hand-sized brush. The bristles are soft enough not to damage your skin and yet stiff enough for dry brushing.  Now, I&#x27;ve been dry brushing my thighs for about a week now and there&#x27;s a huge difference is the texture of my skin.  I can only imagine that more dry brushing will lead to better results- I think I&#x27;ll graduate to a firmer brush eventually.</li>
    <li> Love it! Cant wait to see the results</li>
    <li> My brush cane in on time &amp; in a pretty little wrapping with a ribbon. Once I started using it, it worked pretty well on my skin, except the bristles occasionally fall off.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love dry brushing with this brush!! I do wish I had also purchased a long handled one as well.</li>
    <li> Just like the one it replaced</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush because I thought the curved handle would be easier to use than the Dr. Jensen brush that I have (straight detachable handle). The opposite is true. The handle does not fit well in my hand. It would help if it were round instead of flat. It is hard to hang on to and I drop it at least two times with each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft compared to the Dr. Jensen brush. It would be good for the young, elderly and those with very sensitive skin. Dr. Jensen&#x27;s brush has longer, bigger and stiffer bristles. If you plan to use this for dry skin brushing and your skin is not overly sensitive, Dr. Jensen&#x27;s brush is better to promote lymphatic drainage.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush if you&#x27;re into dry brushing.  The handle is angled and makes it comfortable to use.  The bristles are soft - - but not too soft and really do a great job of getting rid of dry skin.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, the bristles are not too hard, and not too soft, I use it to scrub my feet in the shower. The bristles are embodied in a base of plastic so there should be no rot of the wood, as that what happened to another I had. I couldn&#x27;t wish for a better brush.</li>
    <li> perfect for dry brushing ... or for the shower</li>
    <li> After a few uses it became limp and distorted.</li>
    <li> Some years ago I had bought this exact brush at The Body Shop. I loved it. Just recently I decided it needed to be replaced. I  was hoping this brand would meet my expectations. I love this brush as much as the one I had. I also bought one for my daughter trying to convert her to using these brushes. Please continue to carry these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> Nice sturdy brush with curved handle makes it comfortable to use.  Bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff or too soft.  Just right, as Goldie Locks said.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about its weird shape. I still have no idea what use it is to have it slightly askew like that, especially since I switch it from one hand to another. However, it&#x27;s exactly the right size for my shower use; long enough to reach the middle of my back, but short enough to use elsewhere without an awkward handle getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was even small enough to travel with! Since I pretty much need to scrub with bristles to feel clean, I finally had a hotel shower without feeling grimy afterward.</li>
    <li> After the very first use, I noticed a difference in my skin. I am using it to get rid of cellulite, but my skin just felt so soft! It took a bit long to get here, but otherwise I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that you need to keep the handle dry and away from water in the shower.</li>
    <li> A replacement for a well-worn brush with just the right contours. And this one fits the bill in terms of quality and handling. Very nice and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> High quality construction, and the angle in this brush makes is very easy to maneuver while I use it to brush the bottoms of my feet.  I prefer to designate a body brush in my shower specifically for the purpose of washing my feet because they are so effective and help to remove dead skin cells as well as dirt.</li>
    <li> I tried the Yerba Prima brush that&#x27;s still so popular on Amazon, years ago. It was so rough! I could never bring myself to actually brush my skin with that abrasive thing. Also the handle fell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some people complain that this brush is too soft, so I decided to give dry brushing another shot. Love it. I&#x27;ve done it once or twice a day for a couple weeks now. I&#x27;m not sure I buy into the whole lymphatic system/cellulite perks, but I&#x27;m sure it exfoliates, and it feels really great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush. The angled handle makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve used this at least six times.  The size works well, that with handle provides more control.  I love using this in the morning with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint castile liquid soap.  Makes the toe to head scrubbing more invigorating.</li>
    <li> I love my new dry, body brush.  It feels very exfoliating and like it gets your blood circulating.  The product came in new condition and was shipped and received very quickly.  I would recommend this seller.  I got a great deal.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the bath!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, softish body brush and I like the curved handle</li>
    <li> I know you get what you pay for, but I expected more despite this being &amp;#34;value priced.&amp;#34; After only a few days, the bristles started collapsing and matting, and now half the bristles are all squashed down. When I read &amp;#34;cleanses,&amp;#34; I assumed that meant it could get wet. If the bristles don&#x27;t get wet, they might hold up better than I experienced. If you plan on using this as a bath brush, choose another option. On the plus side, the wood is nicely treated and won&#x27;t warp or swell when it gets wet. Whatever they used to attach the bristles works really well and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the bristles coming out.</li>
    <li> This brush was waaayyyy to soft. This brush couldn&#x27;t scratch the surface of air! Not a good body brush at all. And my bristles keep coming out every time I move it.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time. Bigger than expected but that&#x27;s good!  Great brush the bristles aren&#x27;t too soft are too stiff. I would give 5 stars but the only down side to this brush is the very awkward shaped handle... I knew before buying it that the handle was going to be awkward but I didn&#x27;t mind. not sure the purpose of the curved handle just makes holding it a bit awkward. But it still works good and does what I want it to do...</li>
    <li> I have tried different body brushes before. So far this is the best. It is firm but soft enough not to scratch my skin. It is easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I use it before every shower, brushing upwards towards the heart. Works like a charm - and my skin is so soft!</li>
    <li> The perfect amount of soft and hard bristles. Shower gel lathers great on it and is made really well! Great price, great product!</li>
    <li> good brush that works well. clients love the feel and that it exfoliates well. can be used wet or dry.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for the face and neck because of the wooden top and handle.  I can use it without my hair getting tangles in it, and the angle of the handle is a plus.</li>
    <li> Feels so good for dry brushing; not too rough or too soft. The shorter handle does make reaching your back a little challenging, but nothing that can&#x27;t be overcome. Can&#x27;t tell if the dry brushing is helping like the miracle stories I&#x27;ve heard, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting anything. So if I get the yummy feeling of an all over &amp;#34;back scratch&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> so soft. I absolutely love this brush! highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower and it is awesome.</li>
    <li> Feels great but start slow....I had bad headaches at first! Get the 10 day skin brushing detox book too. A lot more info than the internet alone.</li>
    <li> Great for dry brushing!  Very invigorating. And in the shower you can really give yourself a good scrubbing with this thing--the handle won&#x27;t beak. (well, within reason)</li>
    <li> Ease of Handling: (1-10 scale) 8&lt;br /&gt;Roughness: (1-10 scale) 4&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance: (1-10 scale) 1&lt;br /&gt;Length of brush: shorter end (but long enough for facial brushing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received it, I ruffled it a bit to get some of loose strands out.&lt;br /&gt;I use this particularly for the face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Then I started using this for second body dry brushing after Aquasentials Natural Body Smoothing Brush (current price went up after I purchased this one in Amazon.com).&lt;br /&gt;A great result; Reduced shower time in half and still feel so good, silky skin hence less lotion usage, no need to use separate exfoliator.</li>
    <li> all they said it would be!!!</li>
    <li> The bristles are comfortable and I like the length of the handle... Reaches hard to reach areas w/out the long, awkward handle that can get in the way... Very please w/ the purchase.</li>
    <li> The seller delivered the product promptly.  ( within 3 days)  The brush is nicely designed, I like the angled handle.  At first the bristles were rather hard, I simply used the brush gently until they softened up a bit, which only took a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Love using this in the morning before showering to slough dry skin. Nice, natural bristles, and the handle makes it easy to reach your back, etc.</li>
    <li> This is a great skin brush. It&#x27;s durable, perfectly shaped, and has the right amount of scratchiness to address Nordic winter skin.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, good size.  If you buy the two part one with the longer handle (which I have) you usually end up using just the head anyway because they tend not to stay together.  This is better, having a slightly longer handle that is not going to separate.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I can do my dry brushing without harming my skin with scratchy bristles.</li>
    <li> I use this brush everyday. It really gets all the dead skin off your body.</li>
    <li> Complete piece of junk.  Poor quality, don&#x27;t even buy this at all!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality brush which has now lasted for several months with minimal bristle loss. It is a great value for the price and the angle of the head is more comfortable for the back and shoulders.</li>
    <li> The bristles are just the right feel.</li>
    <li> Using this brush on a regular basis has done wonders for my skin.  For years, I used to get red bumps on my arms and the doctor&#x27;s solution was to write me a prescription for some ointment to use, which I didn&#x27;t want to do.  Then my wellness coach Paula Lacobara (skinbeautywellness.com) suggested this brush and I was amazed by the results.  Wish I had known about it years ago!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent little bath brush. The handle length and angle make it so much easier to use than long, straight brushes.</li>
    <li> I find this a little difficult to use becasue of the angled handle, but I&#x27;ve not tried a straight handled brush either. This works so well as and exfoliator especially in the winter months with your skin is dry and looks less them healthy. I prefer this for dry skin brushing instead of any in the shower body scrubs or loofah style products.</li>
    <li> This is a nice thing to have but I&#x27;m not sure that body brushing really does very much.  It&#x27;s a nice feeling though every now and then.</li>
    <li> I really love it and it was much cheaper than what I could find locally. It feels so good. Hope it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Good for adults and kids to shower lather up and clean away.  Super great buy and good quality!</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush to use for your body. Gets rid of dry dead skin cells to help keep your skin looking glowing and soft. Also good for lymph function therapy. I just wish the handle was more comfortable. Is kind of hard on the hand, I have arthritis and is harsh for me to hold.</li>
    <li> Dry brushing feels good and this brush is easy to hold.  If you want to try dry brushing, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t use this as a dry brush - I use it as a exfoliating brush in the shower which is why I have the slippery problem. I tried to rectify the problem by wrapping rubber bands around the handle to add traction but its just not working. I wish the grip was better so that it could be more useful in the shower.</li>
    <li> Nice brush and is soft and yet firm and is great for my wife when bathing, As a short hair person I use it to scrub my head when showering and works well there to</li>
    <li> Nice little body brush.  Was a little rough when I got it, but has softened and its become really nice to use when I have time to take a bath, not as nice to  use if you&#x27;re in a rush and taking a quick shower.</li>
    <li> Great body brush that fits the description for item. Very happy to own this item and has a pleasant look and feel.</li>
    <li> high quality brush, does a good job</li>
    <li> Really soft and the handle makes it easy to use. I would recommend to anyone, as well as purchase another if need be.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price. I like the curved handle a lot.</li>
    <li> This product came opened with simply a torn piece of cellophane and the tag. Returned it easily enough for a refund.</li>
    <li> These bristles have the right amount of firmness. My skin feels soft after I have applied my liquid soap to the brush and exfoliated my skin. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Stimulating!  When I first got into the shower it was a little still, but by the time I was done with my shower, it felt pretty good.  This brush will help with exfoliating my body as well as circulating blood flow.</li>
    <li> This brush is smaller than I thought it was, guess I should of looked harder at the description.  Other than that I love it,  Saves money on soap, and exfoliates better than a loofah.  This brush is also great at getting grime from automotive work out of the grooves in your hands and from under your nails.</li>
    <li> The bristles are much rougher than I thought .</li>
    <li> Very useful, handy, and I like it is not too hurt to my skin.</li>
    <li> Well made and perfect for scrubbing and leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality and price.  I mistakenly bought the much more expensive version of this brush, and bought this one to compare. This brush is fully as good as its more expensive competitor.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This works very well for dry brushing. The bristles don&#x27;t shed, and are firm without being scratchy or hard. The shape of the handle makes this a pretty comfortable brush to use.</li>
    <li> Bristles are not too hard, not too soft.  The handle is a bit short, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> I had tried the plastic bristle brushes and they were either too gentle or felt like a wire brush.  This one is perfect with the right amount of resistance. I use it in the shower and he contoured handle allows me to reach my back.</li>
    <li> Great skin brush!  I love the shape of the handle.</li>
    <li> Good Quality Item, highly recommend. Can&#x27;t really go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> was recommended by thermographer. i like it.</li>
    <li> I do dry brushing with this brush every morning and the bristles are just the right firmness! Not too soft, not too hard! Don&#x27;t lose a lot of bristles either.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I&#x27;ve been dry brushing my body with this brush for just about 2 weeks, and it works beautifully! I love my skin now! I definitely see how people say dry brushing is addictive, as it does amazing things, and feels great! It also helps with ingrown hairs. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brush to any dry brusher. ☺</li>
    <li> We have a hard as nails Sisal brush which gives you a healthy scrub down. This brush soothes and cleanses. It is a great brush. Sturdy, neat ergo shape, and very lovely. Love it! Splurge and get the stiff Sisal and this soft Natural Bristle brush, both.The wood is elegant and looks great in our bath. You will like it.</li>
    <li> I keep giving these to family and friends.  It&#x27;s perfect for dry brushing.  The handle makes it easy to hold and give the perfect pressure.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this for dry body brushing</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this brush. The bristles leave your skin smooth and they get rid of dead skin.If you hate the &amp;#34;strawberry&amp;#34; looking skin (black dots) you should definitely get this brush.  I use it about 3 -4 times a week. The brush will also prevent ingrown hairs in different areas of the body. No more bumps including those areas where you wax. I recommend using baby oil gel after using the brush. The baby oil gel will hydrate your skin making it look very healthy. Ladies, if you want your legs to look amazing try this brush and the baby oil gel you will love it.</li>
    <li> Nice sturdy brush for detox body brushing.  Bristles are stiff, but not too coarse.  I like the shape of the handle for body brushing.  Very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> This does the job well. I have small hands to it&#x27;s kind of hard to grip but I really like it.  Thanks for having nice brushes to choose from Amazon.</li>
    <li> bought them for whole family! Their great!</li>
    <li> I have used a body brush in the shower forever. I usually buy mine right off the shelf at Whole Foods. They were out so I thought I&#x27;d take a chance and order online.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of weeks now and I am a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The material used for the base (handle) gets so slippery when wet, it makes it a chore to use.&lt;br /&gt;I lose several bristles each time I use it and the bristles are so soft that you don;t really get good exfoliation..&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not buy another when this wears out. I&#x27;m hoping to find my regular body brush and retire this one as soon as I can.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush and works great for dry brushing.  I have not used it yet in the shower.  I dry brush then take a luke warm shower and use a rough washcloth and rinse in cool water.  My skin feels and looks great and it definitely helps with circulation.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s made in China.  I also bought the Sublime Beauty Skin brush and I also like that brush too.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it. Skin brushing is my new obsession! It&#x27;s only been a week and my skin looks and feels better. Hoping to see significant improvement in a month. The only thing is that it does have an odor right out of the box. I washed it in Hydrogen peroxide and then again with body wash until the scent was gone. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect except the packaging around the brush was already open...I&#x27;d have preferred it sealed...</li>
    <li> Excellent skin brush!!!</li>
    <li> Just used my new brush and it is terrific! The bristles are just right to give great stimulation so I am looking forward to great results.</li>
    <li> comfortable to hold for the most part, a bit awkward for a back. it takes up a bit of space though if you don&#x27;t have a hanger. the angle does help reach other spots. the brush is a bit soft for me, though i think it varies from brush to brush.</li>
    <li> Great bristles. Easy to grip.  Very solidly built.  However the handle is too short and I am unable to reach well on upper back between shoulder blades.  Seems like the angle should be the other way for a right handed person.  It&#x27;s held up perfectly for 5 months now, but I just bought a longer handled brush so I could more easily reach my back, which was my main reason for getting a bath brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife.  She has lymphedema in her arm due to breast cancer treatment.  The intent was to use it to do a dry brush technique as part of her lymphedema management routine.  This is a quality brush and it has worked very well for lymphedema treatment.  You can find videos on brushing technique on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lymphedema affects her entire arm from the upper arm all of the way down to her hand.  At the end of the day it is easy to look at her hand to see if she is having a good lymphedema day or a bad one.  I&#x27;ve watched her use the brush for ~10mins on her arm (and watersheds) and you can see an immediate reduction in swelling in her hand.  It is important to mention that my wife also sees a therapist, wears compression and does other things to manage her lymphedema!  This brush is not a replacement for other treatments/therapies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this inexpensive brush does give her something that she can do quickly on a regular basis to help manage daily lymphedema fluctuations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone reading this is planning to use this brush for lymphedema, please use good judgement if you have any broken/damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this actually detoxifies the body, as I&#x27;ve heard it does.  What I do know, is that it feels fabulous!  I had patches of rough skin that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get rid of, but after using this a few times, they are smooth again.  :)</li>
    <li> skin brushing is a new thing. It may help boost circulation, stimulate the lymphatic system, eliminate toxins. I have Lymphedema and have had blood clots and  have chosen Kingsley Natural Bristle Body Brush. I have tried other brushes but none can compare their either too soft or real stiff the Kingsley brush for me is just right!</li>
    <li> Nice little  brush.  Really great is one like to use body wash as I do. It is a reasonably priced and worthwhile ;ittle bit of shjower luxury.</li>
    <li> This brush is a really great value. The bristles are the perfect degree of stiffness, and the handle is comfortable to hold. Works great as a pre-shower exfoliator.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this one!</li>
