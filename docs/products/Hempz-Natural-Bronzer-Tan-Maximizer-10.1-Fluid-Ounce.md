      <li>As long as you are not trying to get a tan in day, it is perfect.</li>

      <li>I burn easy</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which I like.  </li>
      <li>It also gives me a good tan fast and burn free, plus the tan holds for a while.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and this smells amazing!</li>
      <li>The lotion works fine.</li>
      <li>This product seems to be working just fine.</li>
      <li>Thanks for an honest sell.</li>
      <li>however, I love hemp oil and how it instantly absorbed into the skin, so I gave this one a try.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well to give nice color</li>
      <li>It would be great for a beginners who is just starting out in a tanning bed.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin naturally and tend to burn.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the Hempz Natural Bronzer Tan Maximizer.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance does smell lightly like peaches, but isn&#x27;t too sweet or too fruity.</li>
      <li>Your skin just smells fresh and clean after use.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t see results quickly.</li>
      <li>Received quickly.  </li>
      <li>Then I put it on in the tanning salon and quickly discovered that about 2 seconds after application the apple smell disappears.  </li>
      <li>Even if you tan in a high heat bed you still don&#x27;t smell burnt like most lotions.</li>
      <li>love the smell, doesn&#x27;t stain my skin, simple spout and easy clean up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair toned and sensitive skinned, so finding the right tanner is crucial.</li>
      <li>Love it, smells good, thick (not runny)</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the smell.</li>
      <li>I broke out in a full body rash the first time I used this stuff</li>
      <li>whatever that smell is, I wasn&#x27;t really excited about my skin absorbing it.</li>
      <li>The lotion is good quality too, its thick and a light brown color.</li>
      <li>Just be aware of that.</li>
      <li>My first impression was mmmmm...</li>
      <li>and I will most likely do that again.</li>
      <li>this is by far my favorite one I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
      <li>It smells great going on, and a little really goes a long way, so you feel like you are getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>as I feel like the lotions they sell at the tanning salon are so very overpriced.  </li>
      <li>therefore you don&#x27;t use all that much to cover even your whole body.</li>
      <li>And I haven&#x27;t really noticed that I&#x27;m getting any darker.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in other stores which is why I ordered it online</li>
      <li>Smells ok in the bottle, kind of like pomegranate, but once applied it smells like chemicals and bug spray, which only gets worse after you tan.  </li>
      <li>The smell is different, but not a bad smell like a lot of tanning lotions have.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half, and my tan is deeper and more brown</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing this product more in the future.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>This appeared to be a great deal but not when the wrong product is received.</li>
      <li>Did come a tad smaller than expectee but still worth the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really disappointed, I love Hempz regular body lotions, they are great.</li>
      <li>Gave a decent amount of color for being a natural lotion with no bronzer.  </li>
      <li>This is my 2nd time purchasing this tanning lotion from Amazon, so much cheaper than in the salon.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin really soft.</li>
      <li>It gives my skin the most natural above anything else I&#x27;ve tried in the past</li>
      <li>The lotion is very thick, but spreads very easily</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past (a few years ago) and since then have used countless other tanning lotions, but always think of this one as the best.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it runs out very quickly!  </li>
      <li>and I shouldn&#x27;t be so tough on this innocent dog....</li>
      <li>It smells like pomegranate, much like other Hempz products.</li>
      <li>I have been using the green bottle for the past 4 months and have received many compliments on my natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>, little did i know it wouldnt  give me much of a bronze look, so i give it three stars only because i realized i still wanted to get darker</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for all other Tanners!</li>

<li> Will definitely use and buy again as long as I&#x27;m going tanning.</li>
<li> i have fair skin, i had already had a base tan</li>
<li> The only slight downside is that it&#x27;s pretty thick, almost like a body butter, so it does take a few minutes to rub in but its not greasy or watery at all!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not as dark in color as I wanted it was a cream colored lotion the darker the lotion the better</li>
    <li> Received quickly.  Product is pretty good.  Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which I like.  Not greasy.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> I broke out in a full body rash the first time I used this stuff</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time purchasing this tanning lotion from Amazon, so much cheaper than in the salon. Love it, smells good, thick (not runny) and I like that it is a natural bronzer and not loaded with dark bronzer (I want my tan to come from the tanning bed, not the lotion) I&#x27;ve used cheaper over the counter tanning lotions and have burned but this one seems to help with not burning. Will definitely use and buy again as long as I&#x27;m going tanning.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well to give nice color</li>
    <li> Green bottle &amp;#34;natural bronzer&amp;#34; pictured but purple bottle &amp;#34;ultra dark&amp;#34;  received.  I have been using the green bottle for the past 4 months and have received many compliments on my natural looking tan. I don&#x27;t care for bronzer lotions and have not tried the ultra dark. I had hoped to receive what I thought I was ordering since I pay $35/bottle at my tanning salon. This appeared to be a great deal but not when the wrong product is received.</li>
    <li> LOVE hempz brand tanning lotions and this is by far my favorite one I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell. When I was in the tanning bed I smelt like burning plastic. I like how it makes my skin feel but it lacks bronzer so you don&#x27;t see results quickly. But for the price, not too bad of a product. I have added a photo of the ingredients for those of you asking.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING i will give it that. i have fair skin, i had already had a base tan so i thought id just get a maximmizer with bronzer, little did i know it wouldnt  give me much of a bronze look, so i give it three stars only because i realized i still wanted to get darker so i shouldnt of got this. but i  would recommend it if your happy with your tan already, it smells soooooooooooooooo good like peaches :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell, still haven&#x27;t been tanning yet though lol!</li>
    <li> Perfect tanning lotion goes on well and smells great</li>
    <li> It smells really wonderful. Even if you tan in a high heat bed you still don&#x27;t smell burnt like most lotions. The only slight downside is that it&#x27;s pretty thick, almost like a body butter, so it does take a few minutes to rub in but its not greasy or watery at all!</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working just fine. I&#x27;m still not finished using it but a friend recommended it to me so I got it. It has a nice peach smell and it does not stain your hands.</li>
    <li> The lotion itself isn&#x27;t bad. Makes my skin really soft. Not crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and this smells amazing! Works great too!</li>
    <li> The lotion works fine. However, the smell is seriously offensive. I tan a lot, and I&#x27;m not too picky about smell, but I was honestly concerned this had gone bad when I put it on. It smells like car polish, or something similar. The chemical smell is out of control, and completely ruins the lotion for me.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing! There&#x27;s no doubt about that. However, the lotion is a bit thick for me. And I haven&#x27;t really noticed that I&#x27;m getting any darker. That is not at fault of the product, I think I may need to get something that has more of a bronzer in it. The only con I have with this is the thickness of the lotion. It would be great for a beginners who is just starting out in a tanning bed. I need something with more strength.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!! I&#x27;m so happy with it, it smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth! Did come a tad smaller than expectee but still worth the price. Will def keep ordering !</li>
    <li> Kinda greasy after I get out of the bed, smells wondeful! Natural color looks good! I&#x27;d buy it again I think.</li>
    <li> This company makes my favorite moisturizer, so I decided to try their tanning lotion. This product is now my favorite tanning lotion. The smell is different, but not a bad smell like a lot of tanning lotions have. Now I just wish this company would make a tanning lotion specifically for the face.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite, but better ingredients than my favorite and works almost as well. Thick and smell not wonderful, but I can live with it.</li>
    <li> As I put this on it smells great! The lotion is good quality too, its thick and a light brown color. While I was putting it on I was pleased. However for the past few days I feel like the smell is lingering. After using this in the tanning bed I didn&#x27;t smell awful, but I smell strange. I was unsure if I was what smelled or if the cockerspaniel I&#x27;m dog-sitting smelled and I later decided maybe it was me and I shouldn&#x27;t be so tough on this innocent dog....Like I said I don&#x27;t smell awful just not good. I used to use Mood Indigo and people would tell me I smelled amazing after I tanned. Ohhh how I long for those days....and even after I shower the lotion has sunken so deep into my pores that every time I sweat the tiniest amount that weird smell still seeps out of me. I&#x27;m upset that I spent my money on it and its a hassle to return... had I known what it would be like I would&#x27;ve chosen a different lotion, maybe I would&#x27;ve splurged for a bottle of Cypher. I feel shame.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair toned and sensitive skinned, so finding the right tanner is crucial. I burn easy so I tend to stick with hemp based products to prevent that. This lotion is thick in consistency but it does the job well. It smells like pomegranate, much like other Hempz products. It gives my skin the most natural above anything else I&#x27;ve tried in the past so I do intend to use it again.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this in a tanning bed. Here is her review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff! It smells great going on, and a little really goes a long way, so you feel like you are getting your money&#x27;s worth. It also gives me a good tan fast and burn free, plus the tan holds for a while. And, it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. My tanning salon charges over $40 for this bottle. Can not beat the price!! I will order it again!</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells so good!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion. I have tried others this exceeded my expectations!!</li>
    <li> Smells terrific and results are terrific! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Has a weird smell to it but we&#x27;ll see if it works</li>
    <li> Smells good, OK tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> BEST tanning lotion EVER!!! love the smell, doesn&#x27;t stain my skin, simple spout and easy clean up. buy now!!!!</li>
    <li> this product is fantastic! I was very skeptical buying a lotion 4 using in tanning beds, as I feel like the lotions they sell at the tanning salon are so very overpriced.  however, I love hemp oil and how it instantly absorbed into the skin, so I gave this one a try. The fragrance does smell lightly like peaches, but isn&#x27;t too sweet or too fruity. Unlike other sunless tanners, there isn&#x27;t that weird, burnt smell after a while. Your skin just smells fresh and clean after use. The lotion is very thick, but spreads very easily therefore you don&#x27;t use all that much to cover even your whole body. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half, and my tan is deeper and more brown then I have ever gotten. I have fair skin naturally and tend to burn. Also, sunless tanners tend to make me too yellow. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This appears to be a sunless tanning product online. It is a tan enhancer. Just be aware of that. I will add it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; every self tanner has.. Which is nice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past (a few years ago) and since then have used countless other tanning lotions, but always think of this one as the best.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like so many other tanning lotions do and since I have very fair skin, this product doesn&#x27;t just help me get tan, it also seems to moisturize and keep me from getting really red and my skin doesn&#x27;t peel.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in other stores which is why I ordered it online and I will most likely do that again.</li>
    <li> Now that I know I don&#x27;t have to pay those stupid prices at the salons,  I&#x27;ll always order online.  It&#x27;s the same product.</li>
    <li> I thought it was for a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I have used Hempz products including the regular lotions for any years, their line of products are excellent. Would recommend these products for all.</li>
    <li> Initially when I received this product I opened it and took a sniff.  My first impression was mmmmm...yummy, smelled like apples.  Then I put it on in the tanning salon and quickly discovered that about 2 seconds after application the apple smell disappears.  I&#x27;m not entirely sure what it is, but the chemical scent instinctively made me wonder if I should be using this one my skin, whatever that smell is, I wasn&#x27;t really excited about my skin absorbing it. No more apple, just...yuck.  I immediately went home and took a shower to get the weird smell off of me.  I&#x27;m really disappointed, I love Hempz regular body lotions, they are great.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and works super well!  My only complaint is that it runs out very quickly!  I will definitely be purchasing this product more in the future.</li>
    <li> This was cheaper here, but even inside of the packaging, it leaked all over. Works well, keeping skin moisturized. Smell is not as pleasing as some others.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the Hempz Natural Bronzer Tan Maximizer.  I have used this product before and definitely will continue to do so.  Highly recommend for all other Tanners!</li>
    <li> I love hempz and use it all the time but this smelled good until about an hour after I tanned and It made me smell so weird and idk if it was the way my body reacted to the lotion or what but I only use it if I have time to shower after I can&#x27;t stand the after smell</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s the smell when I use it at the tanning salo. It is a good product.</li>
    <li> Gave a decent amount of color for being a natural lotion with no bronzer.  No streaking since there isn&#x27;t a bronzer but this stuff smells TERRIBLE.  Smells ok in the bottle, kind of like pomegranate, but once applied it smells like chemicals and bug spray, which only gets worse after you tan.  Don&#x27;t use it unless you plan on showering immediately after tanning because you will STINK.</li>
    <li> Very good, smooth natural color.  As long as you are not trying to get a tan in day, it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected.  Thanks for an honest sell.</li>
    <li> Gave me a dark tan. No orange tint, easily the best tan I&#x27;ve gotten from a tanning bed. Definitely would recommend.</li>
