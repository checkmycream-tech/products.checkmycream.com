### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>very good exfoliator for sunless tanner</li>
      <li>Wife looks great tanned in summer fashions, but can&#x27;t do it in booths or sun, this was the best she has found.</li>
      <li>Does a good job.  </li>
      <li>Brazilian by Tarte works much better!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best tanning lotion on the market!!</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>Better than any I have used.</li>
      <li>I purchased these three items, Tan Physics True Color Balance Pre-Tan Exfoliator 8 Oz., Tan Physics True Color Sunless Tanner 8 Oz.</li>
      <li>and Tan Physics True Color Ultra-Hydrating Tan Extender 8 Oz., on Amazon.com</li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure I followed the instructions to get a long lasting tan.</li>
      <li>Oh well live and learn.</li>
      <li>It was good, but for the cost,  next time I&#x27;ll go with a less expensive brand that is just as good such as  $10 for the airbrush spray Neutrogena.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe how natural it looks.</li>
      <li>and I would not waste my money on them if I had it to do all over again.  </li>
      <li>Not completely convinced how much exfoliating was actually achieved.</li>

    <li> It was good, but for the cost,  next time I&#x27;ll go with a less expensive brand that is just as good such as  $10 for the airbrush spray Neutrogena.  Same color, same lasting factor, same odor, same amount of streaking if one isn&#x27;t VERY careful.</li>
    <li> Purchased this with the sunless tanning lotion. I wanted to make sure I followed the instructions to get a long lasting tan. Was hoping for something that wouldn&#x27;t look orange. Didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> Did not care for this product. Did not hold on to the self tanner. Maybe the problem was the self tanner?</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how natural it looks. Best tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Not a good color.  Has that weird smell too.  I Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it. Waste of my hard-earned money $$$</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion on the market!!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product at all, it does not do what has been promised. It comes off on your clothes and it flakes totally unhappy.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Does a good job.  Better than any I have used.</li>
    <li> Did not like it.  Dries out your skin and streaks! Ugly color.  Brazilian by Tarte works much better!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
    <li> I purchased these three items, Tan Physics True Color Balance Pre-Tan Exfoliator 8 Oz., Tan Physics True Color Sunless Tanner 8 Oz. and Tan Physics True Color Ultra-Hydrating Tan Extender 8 Oz., on Amazon.com and I would not waste my money on them if I had it to do all over again.  They did darken my skin, but anytime I would sweat, they would turn my clothing and bed sheets orange.  I ended up throwing them away after using them a couple of weeks.  Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> very good exfoliator for sunless tanner</li>
    <li> Wife looks great tanned in summer fashions, but can&#x27;t do it in booths or sun, this was the best she has found.</li>
    <li> The ordering process was very confusing. I ended up ordering two of the exfoliator. I thought I was ordering the tan builder and an exfoliater. So I&#x27;m very disgusted I have no tanner to use.</li>
    <li> I think a basic exfoliator would have done  the job equally as well--especially for the price. Oh well live and learn.</li>
    <li> Not completely convinced how much exfoliating was actually achieved.</li>
