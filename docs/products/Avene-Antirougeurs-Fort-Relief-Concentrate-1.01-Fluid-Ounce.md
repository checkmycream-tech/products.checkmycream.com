<li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and didn&#x27;t really notice the results.  </li>
<li> Ive been using avene products for a long time.</li>
<li> My rosacea is more the painful bumps and some redness.  </li>

<li> I also don&#x27;t know if after time I can use perhaps every other day.</li>
<li> Even some of the other stuff from the AVene Antirougeurs line doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin but this one does.&lt;br</li>
<li> Red spots actually disappeared and the broken capillaries are not as noticeable.  </li>
<li> This brand is also marketed as a sensitive skin line but it seems to make my skin worse.  </li>
<li> This product calms the redness, the bumps go down in a day or two</li>
<li> Will have to test that down the line.</li>
<li> but I have not had it long enough to know if it will also help now that winter is here which can make the condition a little worse.</li>
<li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago because I have Rosaecea.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months now and notice very little difference.</li>
<li> While some have said it&#x27;s expensive, a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> It got really bad.  </li>
<li> so therefore they are no longer painful.  </li>
<li> My skin feels horrible after using.  </li>

    <li> good product and good shipping.  highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and didn&#x27;t really notice the results.  Now, after using it again after a break of several months, I can honestly say I saw a big difference.  Red spots actually disappeared and the broken capillaries are not as noticeable.  I do recommend this product. I have very fair skin and Avene works wonders.</li>
    <li> It was recommened by my dermatologist for use for the redness of my sensitive skin. It helps calm the redness and I look better, but I taking  other medications, my skin looks better.</li>

    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist for my rosacea.  It performs beautifully.  My rosacea is more the painful bumps and some redness.  This product calms the redness, the bumps go down in a day or two so therefore they are no longer painful.  This is also a very moisturizing product.  Other products I had been using were very drying and just did nothing to help my skin.  I highly recommend this product once you check with your dermatologist that it is appropriate for your conditions.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product.  Avene products are wonderful.</li>
    <li> this product was recommended by my dermatologist, and I have been using it for about 6 months. it is a good product. but prepare to wait well over 6 weeks for delivery. so if you want it, order early.</li>
    <li> This product was recommened by my dermatologist for use for the redness of my sensitive skin.  It helps calm the redness and I look better.</li>
    <li> Ive been using avene products for a long time. They are good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> does help with rosacea, have been using it of 3 years.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, effective product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago because I have Rosaecea. Even though I take medication I still have - sometimes more than others - the &#x27;rosy cheek&#x27; look. I have seen an improvement almost right away. While my level of Rosaecea may be less than others, this works better than some of the cosmetic products I&#x27;ve tried. Biggest test--renewing my drivers license which is taken under harsh, bright lights! I&#x27;ve never been able to really tone down the rose look, but this time it was much better. While some have said it&#x27;s expensive, a little goes a long way. I did have to wait almost 2 weeks (note for re-order) and I also contacted the company for exact use help. I&#x27;d have given this a 5 star but I have not had it long enough to know if it will also help now that winter is here which can make the condition a little worse. I also don&#x27;t know if after time I can use perhaps every other day. Will have to test that down the line.</li>
    <li> Maybe Good but Not for Rosacea !</li>
    <li> I just loved...is perfect for redness relief ♥daily for my sensitive skin its very smooth texture skin on my face thank me every day for awesome filling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months now and notice very little difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff really isn&#x27;t for me.  I have extremely sensitive rosacean skin.  It&#x27;s basically red all the time.  I have used several items from the La Roche Posay line with great results.  This brand is also marketed as a sensitive skin line but it seems to make my skin worse.  It doesn&#x27;t hydrate and doesn&#x27;t even rub in very good.  My skin feels horrible after using.  I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase again and will be giving it away!</li>
    <li> I do not have normal skin. I&#x27;m guessing if you&#x27;re looking at this you don&#x27;t either. Fort Relief is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works on my ultra-sensitive skin without causing breakouts or redness while still remaining non greasy. Even some of the other stuff from the AVene Antirougeurs line doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin but this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on beautifully under makeup. Insanely expensive but ultimately worth it.</li>
    <li> I am using. I don&#x27;t know it good or not</li>
    <li> I have rosacea .  It got really bad.  We had tried all the topical treatments along with oral meds and nothing seemed to work.  took me off of my topical treatments and gave me a sample of this.  I loved it.  this was the best price that I found.</li>
