    <li> I bought it for my father who fell down a week ago and needed some support. Both of us loved it. It has a classy look, shipping was fast, packaging was safe. I am very happy to see my father loving his first cane. Thanks</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Feels good in my hand, and works well when I need to use it.</li>
    <li> The cane ordered was not the size I asked for when it arrived. Would not recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and supportive.</li>
    <li> The cane is nice. My mother loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Thuc</li>
    <li> I purchased this cane for my \\&quot;House, MD\\&quot; costume in 2007. It was much less expensive than the replicas from the set. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because I just needed it for part of my costume. I have no disability whatsoever, but I still used it while in costume. It looks nice, appears well built and worked very well.</li>
    <li> I love the cane, but it loses one star because it is far lighter than the photo.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a richer look.&lt;br /&gt;But darker and you will be happy.</li>
    <li> This cane weighs 3 pounds but it feels like Balsa wood.  We are all different; some folks like it.  For me, this can gives no support.  Its base is too narrow.  The wood is very light.  It wobbles unless you hold it tight to your hip.  There is no help for me at all.</li>
    <li> What can go wrong with a cane?</li>
    <li> This product is very nicely done.  The finish is beautiful and the cane works very well.  It is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> A well designed cane.  Just the right height for me.  It looks good and it is easy to use.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Cane is nicely made, very plain, but functional.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great quality but a little shorter than I expected.</li>
    <li> My cane was delivered sooner than expected, and was a very good quality product.</li>
    <li> My husband is waiting for knee replacement surgery and needs a cane to support him. This cane is sturdy and handsome and he doesn&#x27;t feel he looks like \\&quot;an old man\\&quot; while using it. It came in time and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> I am a 62 year old gentleman and am disabled. I weigh approx 215lbs and stand 5&#x27;11\\&quot;. This Alex wood cane is well made and is a perfect support for my walking disabilities.  I received this product on time and is was packaged well so as not to sustain damage.  It was as it was shown and a good price.  I am well pleased with the product and seller.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed - I broke my original one and this is just right.  I give it a great rating!</li>
    <li> This is a very stylish cane and my son feels better about using it since it doesn&#x27;t look like a &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; device.</li>
    <li> My brother loves it and I will buy another soon for him..prompt shipping.  Very nice cane.  Thank you</li>
    <li> over all a good solid cane. Shipping was on time. Ordering was simple and easy. The only thing I saw not to standard was the difference in color. My cane was lighter in color than what was pictured.</li>
    <li> I wish you could adust the cane to be taller,possibily 1-2 ins.taller. If you know of any other companies,let me know.THe cane could be taller.</li>
    <li> I got this for my father in-law and he loved it. Pick your style and it comes to you instead of settling for what you find at your third stop.</li>
