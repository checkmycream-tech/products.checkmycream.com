      <li>My hair gets dry very quickly, but ends up frizzy.</li>

      <li>The first one broke in half.  </li>
      <li>(more than normal hair dryer loud) with a particularly annoying pitch, and it did not get sufficiently hot.  </li>
      <li>But no, they had redesigned slightly and just enough that we had to remove the first mounting and replace it.  </li>
      <li>If you want a hair dryer that is powerful and small</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like the size and ease of using. There are only 2 settings a 1 and 2. The 1 is like a medium and the 2 is high. I had another wall mounted hair dryer that lasted forever it seemed and I couldn&#x27;t replace it so I decided to go with the Andis. It would be nice to have a low setting for finer styling. The medium setting is too strong for this.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted.  The dryer is just like the ones you find in your hotel room.  It is quick and powerful for drying your hair. Hangs nicely on the wall. I have also used it without it hanging on the wall. Much nicer to use when it is hung on the wall.  If you want a hair dryer that is powerful and small this is the one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these.  The first one only lasted about a year or so and then suddenly burned up one day and stopped.  I thought It might be one of those things and ordered another to replace it.  That one only lasted 4 months.  I only use it for 5-7 minutes at a time about 5 times a week, so I don&#x27;t think that was excessive.  So now I&#x27;m ordering another hanging hair dryer, but will choose a different brand this time.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> No night light on this model - just what I wanted.  It is smaller, so the power is a little lower, but it fits in my small bathroom</li>
    <li> I have wanted one of these hairdryers for years.  the hotels have them...it is so convenient to have the hairdryer mounted on the wall. This dryer is small and lightweight... easy to use.  It is powerful enough to dry long hair too... it has two speeds.</li>
    <li> This is my second dryer. The first one broke in half.  I used duct tape to make it useable until I received the new one. The motor continued to work well.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the same model hoping I could use the same wall mounting.  But no, they had redesigned slightly and just enough that we had to remove the first mounting and replace it.  I like the convenience, but I would really like to see them redesign it with a few more features:  keep it compact, wall-mounted, but add a cool function and make it quieter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is very loud, even though they advertise differently.  I would recommend it as is, but would love those additional features.</li>
    <li> Great buy.  Works just as advertised</li>
    <li> I really like it for a couple of reasons. The size and also the blower, it is the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;One problem, I had one before this order and it only lasted a year.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve purchased.  The 1st one lasted several years.  I like the compact, light size.  I first used one at a hotel.  When I ordered it for home I just removed it from the wall mount.  Love that the cord is VERY LONG.</li>
    <li> Bought the first one at an RV store and it lasted for several years of daily use. When it finally wore out, bought another one (same model). After about 6 months of use, the wires in the handle had been pinched and shorted out and damaged the unit. Bought another one. My wife has been using it for the last several months and this morning there was a pop and the low speed quit. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because is  a really nice unit that we have liked, but wondering now about the quality control on recently produced units.</li>
    <li> Used this dryer in hotel and liked it so much that I searched online and found it at great price on Amazon.  Dryer is compact, dries hair fast and heat setting is not too hot.  You have option of mounting on wall bracket or not.  I use as home dryer and also take with me for travel.  Great little dryer and prefer over many other name brand hair dryers I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> We have purchased several of these over the years for our own bathrooms and as gifts and we are never disappointed in their quality.</li>
    <li> It is light weight, easy to hold, and it&#x27;s two levels of power make it perfect for all hair styling.</li>
    <li> I have a broken shoulder and a large blow dryer that is heavy is difficult for me to use.  This works great.</li>
    <li> Decided to try a different brand when my 4th Jerdon in about 6 years burned up.  I ended up returning this to Amazon.  It was VERY loud (more than normal hair dryer loud) with a particularly annoying pitch, and it did not get sufficiently hot.  Was just sort of warm.  The noise and lack of heat combined made the decision easy.  Otherwise, it is a nice looking unit, easy to mount on wall, and light enough.  I wish it had worked.</li>
    <li> In 1999 we bought our Andis HD-3L which is now the 30135.  It died today (16 years of daily use.)  We are ordering another today.</li>
    <li> The unit works well. Is small and light weight.the compact size makes it great for those on the go or in a travel trailer.</li>
    <li> I really do like it! It is so handy and drys my hair very good. I would recommend it to anyone that needs a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering Andis Wall dryers for a while. This one was smaller than the one I had before, which is good in a small bathroom. I&#x27;m very pleased with the temperature and ease of using.</li>
    <li> Not Enough Heat!  The dryer does not get hot enough! I don&#x27;t know if it is defective or by design that the air flowing from the dryer is not Hot enough and in not what I am used to compared to other dryers.  The original box was taped up, it might have been a return item.  Too late to return!</li>
    <li> only one speed HOT Burnt my ends Had to get rid of it</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these which quit working after a few months.  Andis replace it under warranty.  The warranty replacement lasted 3 months with use 4 - 5 times per week.  I cannot recommend this product and will avoid Andis products from this point on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer in August 2013. February 14th the heater element burnt out. Very short life but great when it worked. Wondering how to return or replace?</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer because I used one in a hotel I was staying at and liked it.  I also took into consideration that I have limited space in which to hang it and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> This is so neat, small, yet VERY POWERFUL!  It is so handy to have mounted on the wall.  It makes it so much easier to use and replace after finished.  I have wanted one of these for years....FINALLY ORDERED ONE!!  So glad that I did!  Thanks, Gala Tharp</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for my mother. She is a hair stylist and swears by it. She says it takes up no space and very convenient when mounted on the wall. Works just as good as any other blow dryer she&#x27;s used. Great space saver.</li>
    <li> USED AT THE BEACH IN THE HOTEL, LOVED IT, AM GOING TO BUY ONE SOON. THANK YOU BARB. DONT HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> I had one before and it broke, I wouldn&#x27;t have replaced it with anything else. It was like one in a hotel we used before.</li>
    <li> Very convenient mounted on our bathroom wall next to the mirror over the sink.</li>
    <li> Love these wall mounted dryers.  Have bought them for many years for both bathrooms.</li>
    <li> Compact, fits in a small space. Has enough power if you have short hair. Long or very full hair may require a full sized hair dryer. Great for smaller bathroom, with little counter space.</li>
    <li> This is the third one that I have bought over several years! The first time I used one was in a Hotel where I was staying and I liked it, so I looked up the name of the company (ANDIS) and I ordered one. It&#x27;s very compact and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The cord is connected to the base. I like another brand I bought much better because the cord is only connected to the dryer. The dryer functions as well as my other dryer.</li>
    <li> Very functional when it comes to keeping the clutter off the bathroom counter.  However I was disappointed that speed and temperature aren&#x27;t controlled separately.  My hair gets dry very quickly, but ends up frizzy.</li>
    <li> This is a very powerful hair dryer. The wall mount and coiled cord is nice and keeps it out of the way. We&#x27;ve only had it for a few months so i can&#x27;t speak for longevity.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer - compact and powerful!</li>
    <li> We have used this  for 7 years . We have four and have only replaced 2.  Visitor dropping it, slipped out of hand. Like the ease of use. Speed and form.</li>
