      <li>It works perfectly as an eyebrow pencil</li>
      <li>It is great!</li>
      <li>The pencils are a great darling brown color and glide on like a gel pencil.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about a year the color goes great with my skin color and hair.</li>
      <li>I use this to fill in my brows and it works great.</li>
      <li>Cover Girl eyeliner if a great product.  </li>
      <li>They work great to fill in my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Good smooth formula, goes on wonderfully.</li>
      <li>but the way you put it on and how you use it is good.</li>
      <li>The price is exceptional.</li>
      <li>I love this brow pencil!</li>
      <li>the color is amazing.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this pencil for my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Love this for my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>I love the price and how easy it is to apply.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the other brands this one is the best for the price.</li>
      <li>They sharpen easily.</li>
      <li>And the other is great, but the tip breaks off very easily.</li>
      <li>The color works well with my hair color, which is light brown.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s light</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am naturally blonde but lighten my  hair to platinum; my daughter has red hair and this shade works perfectly for both of us because we both like a darker brow.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I have also used them on my eyelids when I am going for a more natural look and do not have time to apply my liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Better than the old MAC brow pencil I used to buy which is overpriced</li>
      <li>I love these cover girl dark brown brow pencils  my favorite</li>
      <li>It doesnt look cake, it looks light and  natural!</li>
      <li>I buy atleast 10 packages each or more on Amazon for my daily use.</li>
      <li>Most pencils have too much red in them.  </li>
      <li>Color was exactly what I was expecting and wanting.</li>
      <li>This is the only&lt;br /&gt;eyebrow pencil that has lasted through so many tests - including multiple motorcycle helmet putting on and taking offs, hiking through tropical rain forests and running and cycling through pouring rain.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of this brown pencil (midnight brown) since it first came out.</li>
      <li>I am shopping around for a replacement for these and as soon as I find something decent and in the right price range I am jumping ship and will no longer be buying these rotten things.</li>
      <li>my best friend that has dirty blonde hair would benefit more.</li>
      <li>Plus, the liner can easily be removed without  losing tiny eyebrow hairs.</li>
      <li>The trick is to lightly apply a pat of translucent face powder after applying the brow liner to make them last all day in pretty much all conditions.</li>
      <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge or run too much.  </li>
      <li>know these are inexpensive pencils, but I still don&#x27;t think they should break so much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely real, and it came at a reasonable time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried MAC, Urban Decay, NYX, Estee Lauder, Lancome, but none compare to the old drugstore favorite CG Brow &amp; Eye Makers in midnight brown.  </li>
      <li>My hair is brown, and I thought midnight, meant more dark.</li>
      <li>They immediately sent a whole new package in the mail within the week.  </li>
      <li>Love the little sharpener that came with it.</li>
      <li>The color is natural (some of the others look either to ashy or to warm to be believable), and the pencil leaves a matte line so you don&#x27;t have that big shiny &#x27;eyebrow&#x27; that your friend&#x27;s scary old aunties used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Colors in their line are so much better than all the others, expensive or cheap.</li>
      <li>I have tried other, more expensive pencils but they do not lay as nice as these.</li>
      <li>They came very quick but package was damaged and one pencil was missing.</li>
      <li>Many others I have used are either chalky or are too dark even though the shade looks similar to these.</li>
      <li>I have typically had very good experiences with Covergirl products and it seems like these pencils were not so easily or often broken in the past.</li>
      <li>but I took a chance and emailed the company and they couldn&#x27;t have been nicer and so professional.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not harsh or smudgy when put on and</li>
      <li>Upon opening the first one of the pencils is a little more dried out.</li>
      <li>and I have to toss it and try to get the pencil sharp enough to get my eyebrows looking decent and not all wild and NOT have that early 80&#x27;s Brooke Shields thing going on.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If the is a half star i will see it too much for this pen</li>

<li> &lt;br /&gt;Not dark brown</li>

<li> ......when I try to sharpen these things with the sharpener provided in the package half the time the colored point breaks off flush with the wood outer casing</li>
<li> The only problem I have is that the pencil tip seems to get very hard</li>
<li> It looks very natural and doesn&#x27;t look fake or too harsh.  </li>
<li> I get lazy sometimes to go to store and buy it</li>
<li> I purchased these because they are hard to find in stores anymore.</li>
<li> and I have a hard time using it as an eyeliner since it is too difficult to even apply under my eyes.  </li>
<li> nope I was wrong.</li>
<li> Being frustrated almost to tears while putting on my makeup does nothing for my look or my day</li>

    <li> Perfect shade for me, just what I was lookin for.</li>
    <li> I can use this in the morning when getting ready and not have to touch up until evening(before a late dinner or night out). Color was exactly what I was expecting and wanting. Good smooth formula, goes on wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Love this for my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve tried all the other brands this one is the best for the price.</li>
    <li> I get lazy sometimes to go to store and buy it I want them from Amazon I love these cover girl dark brown brow pencils  my favorite</li>
    <li> Cover Girl eyeliner if a great product.  I love the price and how easy it is to apply.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge or run too much.  This does not create any problem with my allergies.  The only problem is that I didn&#x27;t like the color.  The color was a lot darker than I expected.  In the future, I will not take any chance with the color.  I recommend this product if this is the color that one needs.  The price is exceptional.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product (midnight brown and midnight black) for years and years.  This is the only&lt;br /&gt;eyebrow pencil that has lasted through so many tests - including multiple motorcycle helmet putting on and taking offs, hiking through tropical rain forests and running and cycling through pouring rain.  I&#x27;m not even kidding.  There have never been any smudges and my brows always look neat  and defined!  Plus, the liner can easily be removed without  losing tiny eyebrow hairs. The trick is to lightly apply a pat of translucent face powder after applying the brow liner to make them last all day in pretty much all conditions.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this pencil for my eyebrows. It is great! It allows plenty of control. It doesnt look cake, it looks light and  natural!</li>
    <li> I have been using these pencils for about two years now and I love them. I use them to fill in my eyebrows as well as shape them. They are simple to use and come with a sharpener which I use typically every few weeks. The product is simple, but it works. I have tried other, more expensive pencils but they do not lay as nice as these. Many others I have used are either chalky or are too dark even though the shade looks similar to these. The color works well with my hair color, which is light brown. I have also used them on my eyelids when I am going for a more natural look and do not have time to apply my liquid eyeliner. I would definitely recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> My natural brows are an ashy brown and this pencil is just a little bit darker to make them look like a chestnut shade.  It looks very natural and doesn&#x27;t look fake or too harsh.  The only problem I have is that the pencil tip seems to get very hard and I have a hard time using it as an eyeliner since it is too difficult to even apply under my eyes.  It works perfectly as an eyebrow pencil but it just pinches and pulls when I use it on my eyes.</li>
    <li> My hair is brown, and I thought midnight, meant more dark. nope I was wrong. my best friend that has dirty blonde hair would benefit more. but the way you put it on and how you use it is good. just not my color if you are dark brown.</li>
    <li> Been my fav brand and color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. They are the closest matching color for me. They sharpen easily. They seem to last me quite a while too. Sometimes they do come off streaky though.</li>
    <li> Excellent Transaction--Great Product--Fast Shipping--A+A+A+</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Smaller then what I thought they should be but that&#x27;s my fault for not paying attention. They work great to fill in my eyebrows. Love the little sharpener that came with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased these because they are hard to find in stores anymore. They came very quick but package was damaged and one pencil was missing. I didn&#x27;t think I was going to get a replacement but I took a chance and emailed the company and they couldn&#x27;t have been nicer and so professional. They immediately sent a whole new package in the mail within the week.  The pencils are a great darling brown color and glide on like a gel pencil. Will definitely shop with this company again!</li>
    <li> ......when I try to sharpen these things with the sharpener provided in the package half the time the colored point breaks off flush with the wood outer casing and I wind up using maybe half of each pencil while the other half is wasted due to this breakage problem. I&#x27;m not sure if the issue is with the pencils themselves or with the cheap-o sharpeners sold in the package with them, I only know I am tired of constant sharpening and constant feeling like I am getting ripped off every time a point breaks off and I have to toss it and try to get the pencil sharp enough to get my eyebrows looking decent and not all wild and NOT have that early 80&#x27;s Brooke Shields thing going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know these are inexpensive pencils, but I still don&#x27;t think they should break so much. I have typically had very good experiences with Covergirl products and it seems like these pencils were not so easily or often broken in the past. Get it together, Covergirl. I am shopping around for a replacement for these and as soon as I find something decent and in the right price range I am jumping ship and will no longer be buying these rotten things. Being frustrated almost to tears while putting on my makeup does nothing for my look or my day and I will not continue to buy a product if the manufacturer of that product does nothing to preserve its quality.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time!</li>
    <li> If the is a half star i will see it too much for this pen&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too dray&lt;br /&gt;And i didn&#x27;t like the color, it&#x27;s light&lt;br /&gt;Not dark brown</li>
    <li> I love this brow pencil! It&#x27;s the best one that I have found yet!</li>
    <li> This is the truest color to my brown eyebrows.  Most pencils have too much red in them.  This doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I use this to fill in my brows and it works great. I have used other brands and nothing works as well as this brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year the color goes great with my skin color and hair. Better than the old MAC brow pencil I used to buy which is overpriced</li>
    <li> This product is my go to eyebrow pencil. It&#x27;s not harsh or smudgy when put on and the color is amazing. I&#x27;ve been a fan of this brown pencil (midnight brown) since it first came out. I have a hard time finding it in the stores so THANKS TO AMAZON I buy atleast 10 packages each or more on Amazon for my daily use. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
    <li> Love Cover Girl eyebrow pencils - -goes on smoothly, stays on, not so thin that they look fake and you can feather them out.  Colors in their line are so much better than all the others, expensive or cheap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely real, and it came at a reasonable time. I ordered two packs. Upon opening the first one of the pencils is a little more dried out. It doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly. And the other is great, but the tip breaks off very easily. It&#x27;s also a little more expensive online than it was at the store.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this color at ANY Store by me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried MAC, Urban Decay, NYX, Estee Lauder, Lancome, but none compare to the old drugstore favorite CG Brow &amp; Eye Makers in midnight brown.  The color is natural (some of the others look either to ashy or to warm to be believable), and the pencil leaves a matte line so you don&#x27;t have that big shiny &#x27;eyebrow&#x27; that your friend&#x27;s scary old aunties used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am naturally blonde but lighten my  hair to platinum; my daughter has red hair and this shade works perfectly for both of us because we both like a darker brow.</li>
