### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Sulfur seems to work the best on my skin.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
      <li>This product is a great value.</li>
      <li>it works great as a SPOT treatment for problem pimples.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had good results, and the lotion/cream does work-</li>
      <li>Twist on cap seems like a good way to keep product contained</li>
      <li>It leaves a kind of greasy film on my skin so</li>
      <li>but maybe I can create my own.</li>
      <li>It is just as effective however, just a noticeably cheaper brand.</li>
      <li>This is more of a lotion (hence my 4-stars).  </li>
      <li>It worked better than my prescription acne cream.</li>
      <li>I have been able to leave it on for about 20 minutes without any dryness of irritation.</li>
      <li>Its okay, I doubt its 10% sulfur.</li>
      <li>but of course, it depends on every person, it may work for some but not for everyone :)</li>
      <li>(OK, I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>This works amazingly well and quickly for breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I even bought one for a friend because I liked it so much.</li>
      <li>This stuff is junk, through it out and ordered a Proactiv Refining Mask 3.5oz on Ebay for $6.25 w/ free shipping.....</li>
      <li>Adult Acne has 8% and is more effective than this.</li>
      <li>After 2 weeks, the condition improved significantly.</li>
      <li>I say if you really want it to work put a bandaid over it to keep it on.. but to be honest I think with all the oiliness it may be counter productive because I noticed more acne appear in the same areas I put the ointment on.</li>
      <li>Also this is really greasy and wipes off easily.</li>
      <li>and after I wash it off in the morning it leaves my skin very smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>skin actually feels nice and moist in the morning.  </li>
      <li>LOVE the other version:).</li>
      <li>Just be sure not to leave it on too long because it is very powerful.</li>
      <li>in pretty well</li>
      <li>So not a bad product, I just like the other version better</li>
      <li>The reason I&#x27;m not giving this a higher review is because this ointment really burns my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Caused large blackheads, which she has never had before.</li>
      <li>I do have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>Very slimy product.</li>
      <li>I really do like this product.</li>
      <li>There are other better products out there.</li>
      <li>When I think of an ointment, I think of an oily product that stays on top of the skin, absorbing a little, but providing a barrier (like diaper ointment).  </li>
      <li>I bought a sulfur animal and in the shower I rubbed it on the spot under my right knee which had eczyma for several years.</li>
      <li>Works very well with scratches, however, it is a bit gritty and really does smell of Sulfur.</li>
      <li>In a few more weeks, the skin should be back to normal.</li>
      <li>And this is despite the fact that I did not use this stuff anywhere near my eyes.</li>
      <li>I suffer from adult acne and this ointment works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is natural and reminds me of a product the dermatologist ordered for me.  </li>
      <li>I use it for facial redness, and found that the other version works much better for me because the shea butter and cocoa butter eliminate the issue of dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Was hoping this would help because I&#x27;ve had some success in the past with the DDF sulfur mask.  </li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m using other products with this simultaneously, I think this is really helping me dry out my zits.</li>

<li> Will last me a long time.</li>
<li> I am a big fan of sulfur ointment for acne, however this brand is very watery and messy compared to other brands I have purchased.</li>
<li> Initially feels oily but works to dry blemishes without over-drying like salicylic acid and Benzoyl Peroxide.  </li>
<li> Dries up my cystic acne spots, but can also cause extreme drying if left on too long.</li>
<li> This product seems to work-into the skin - it&#x27;s actually the outcome I desired, but I had to read the other reviews to understand</li>
<li> When it arrived, I applied it on the dry flaky spot twice a day for 2 weeks.</li>
<li> This product made things worse, so i sent it back and got a complete refund.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Be careful!</li>
<li> No more dry skin though there is still slight itching.</li>
<li> I will use the 10 % less often and see how it goes.</li>
<li> After reading the reviews here, I visited an active volcano in Java where the miners collected sulfur in the crater and sold raw pieces or molded sulfur souvenirs to tourists.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m in my mid thirties and either have really bad hormonal acne or adult acne, regardless, this stuff works!</li>
<li> I used this for a few months but noticed no change</li>
<li> Made my daughter&#x27;s face break out into dozens of small bumps/pimples.</li>
<li> However this is much less expensive and seems to do the job.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.  </li>
<li> This product will make your skin flake and it STINKS like rotten eggs</li>
<li> Wish it came in a 5 % base -</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The reason I&#x27;m not giving this a higher review is because this ointment really burns my eyes.  And this is despite the fact that I did not use this stuff anywhere near my eyes.</li>
    <li> I find this works well for acne.</li>
    <li> Works great! I put it on before bed and after I wash it off in the morning it leaves my skin very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much actually didn&#x27;t do anything in a week of use, but of course, it depends on every person, it may work for some but not for everyone :)</li>
    <li> Dries up my cystic acne spots, but can also cause extreme drying if left on too long. Be careful!</li>
    <li> This works amazingly well and quickly for breakouts.  I even bought one for a friend because I liked it so much.</li>
    <li> I suffer from adult acne and this ointment works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my face, neck and back at night and rinse it off&lt;br /&gt;in the morning.  It leaves a kind of greasy film on my skin so&lt;br /&gt;my skin actually feels nice and moist in the morning.  I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;mind the smell of sulfur but I do avoid putting it too close to my&lt;br /&gt;nose.  Will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work  on my skin</li>
    <li> This product did not seem to help at all. In fact my wife reported having increased breakouts when using this product.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m using other products with this simultaneously, I think this is really helping me dry out my zits.</li>
    <li> This stuff is junk, through it out and ordered a Proactiv Refining Mask 3.5oz on Ebay for $6.25 w/ free shipping.....it works great as a SPOT treatment for problem pimples.</li>
    <li> Very slimy product. Feels gross and even used on a regular basis has not helped to dry up the occassional pimple.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. There are other better products out there.</li>
    <li> product disappears when applied.  makes healing go faster.</li>
    <li> This product is a great value. It worked better than my prescription acne cream. Just be sure not to leave it on too long because it is very powerful.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews here, I visited an active volcano in Java where the miners collected sulfur in the crater and sold raw pieces or molded sulfur souvenirs to tourists. I bought a sulfur animal and in the shower I rubbed it on the spot under my right knee which had eczyma for several years. After 2 weeks, the condition improved significantly. Meanwhile, I ordered this ointment. When it arrived, I applied it on the dry flaky spot twice a day for 2 weeks. After a month, the eczyma is gone! No more dry skin though there is still slight itching. In a few more weeks, the skin should be back to normal. If I had only known about this earlier.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Period. I&#x27;m in my mid thirties and either have really bad hormonal acne or adult acne, regardless, this stuff works! I can use this up to 3 times a day when I have flare ups, but use it regularly morning and night.  I have been able to leave it on for about 20 minutes without any dryness of irritation. I do have very oily skin. I plan using it overnight as a spot treatment too, just not all over.</li>
    <li> This product will make your skin flake and it STINKS like rotten eggs..I had to wash all my bedding...You can&#x27;t get the odor off..If I had known this I would not have ordered the product.Don&#x27;t go out of the house unless you don&#x27;t mind smelling like a fart.</li>
    <li> this same company makes a similar product that also has Shea butter in it.  I use it for facial redness, and found that the other version works much better for me because the shea butter and cocoa butter eliminate the issue of dry skin.  So not a bad product, I just like the other version better (OK, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the other version:).</li>
    <li> I really do like this product. It is natural and reminds me of a product the dermatologist ordered for me.  However this is much less expensive and seems to do the job. Sulfur seems to work the best on my skin. Wish it came in a 5 % base - but maybe I can create my own. I will use the 10 % less often and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Works on my daughter&#x27;s acne by reducing the swelling and redness.</li>
    <li> Only thing that works in my acne. I don&#x27;t experience drying. I use it at night before bed and wash it off in the morning. Will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Initially feels oily but works to dry blemishes without over-drying like salicylic acid and Benzoyl Peroxide.  Twist on cap seems like a good way to keep product contained but it doesn&#x27;t.  Keep item upright to prevent leaking. Shake on occasion to keep mixture dispersed evenly.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Its okay, I doubt its 10% sulfur. Adult Acne has 8% and is more effective than this. Also this is really greasy and wipes off easily. I say if you really want it to work put a bandaid over it to keep it on.. but to be honest I think with all the oiliness it may be counter productive because I noticed more acne appear in the same areas I put the ointment on.</li>
    <li> Made my daughter&#x27;s face break out into dozens of small bumps/pimples. Caused large blackheads, which she has never had before.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of sulfur ointment for acne, however this brand is very watery and messy compared to other brands I have purchased. It is just as effective however, just a noticeably cheaper brand.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything...</li>
    <li> This is more of a lotion (hence my 4-stars).

This product seems to work-into the skin - it&#x27;s actually the outcome I desired, but I had to read the other reviews to understand this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve had good results, and the lotion/cream does work-in pretty well</li>
    <li> Too gritty to wear makeup over it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.  I have hormonal acne.  Was hoping this would help because I&#x27;ve had some success in the past with the DDF sulfur mask.  I used this for a few months but noticed no change</li>
    <li> Works very well with scratches, however, it is a bit gritty and really does smell of Sulfur. Keeping this in my emergency kit.</li>
    <li> This product made things worse, so i sent it back and got a complete refund.</li>
