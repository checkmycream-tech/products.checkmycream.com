      <li>I have been using it for almost a year now, and this is by far the best shampoo I have ever used (ranging from my use of many salon grade shampoos to drugstore brands).</li>
      <li>would never say that either the shampoo or the soap are lovely products, but I was looking for something that works, and</li>
      <li>It extends the effect of the shampoo and prevents itching and redness for about 1-2 more days.</li>

      <li>I now find it to be awakening and refreshing.</li>
      <li>I had suffered for more than 5 years with folliculitis and acne-like bumps on my scalp, which started after an overnight hospital stay.  </li>
      <li>and then I switched to this shampoo because I thought if it was specifically formulated for Demodex infestation, it must do a better job.  </li>
      <li>Works wonderfully for initial treatment.</li>
      <li>I now find it to be awakening and refreshing.</li>
      <li>The dandruff  is under control and his face looks much better.  </li>

      <li>However, yesterday was much better.  </li>
      <li>I do love it, works for dandruff and itchy scalp.  </li>
      <li>I just want to say, most of my \\&quot;pimples\\&quot; on my head have gone away (except 1).</li>
      <li>I do know this for sure, my friend has had these mites for 2 years</li>
      <li>I was even more excited to find this product with amazing reviews.  </li>
      <li>Nice, clean feeling.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!!</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say enough great things about this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say enough great things about this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I was using many products for almost two years without significant results</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, but this shampoo is foaming now, and my hair feels clean and more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, but this shampoo is foaming now, and my hair feels clean and more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It may work fine for what it was intended for, but did not work for me.</li>
      <li>The added bonus was my hair was silky and tangle free after using the shampoo with the Demodex  conditioner.</li>
      <li>My primary doctor and dermatologist could not figure out the severe itching I was experiencing with my scalp.</li>
      <li>I truly hope Amazon continues to offer this shampoo with free Prime shipping.</li>
      <li>works great with regular use</li>
      <li>I truly hope Amazon continues to offer this shampoo with free Prime shipping.</li>
      <li>so I would not recommend using it when you have an important engagement.</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>Leaves scalp feeling clean, stops itching</li>
      <li>I would expect my hair to get greasy after two days, and my head just never seemed to get REALLY clean despite shampooing it twice all the time.</li>
      <li>To be fair when I use it I just use enough to coat my scalp</li>
      <li>So I will continue to smell like sulfur (which he doesnt care for) instead of  sweet flowers.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s true that the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s true that the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also does a great job at removing product build-up leftover from other products.</li>
      <li>It also does a great job at removing product build-up leftover from other products.</li>
      <li>Give it a try, it may work for you too!z-free for days after a quick flat-iron.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for having something available that actually works and smells good.</li>
      <li>Super highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>love this shampoo makes my hair shiny clean soft with body and helps lots with itching .What</li>
      <li>this is very helpful product I strongly recommend to use it for itchy scalp</li>
      <li>The first instinctual diagnosis was dandruff, but none of those familiar dandruff shampoos worked.</li>
      <li>CURED chronic scalp inflammation &amp; itchiness with first use!  </li>
      <li>The entire top layer of my skin scuffed off of my face and neck!  </li>
      <li>and I HIGHLY recomend it!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gentle shampoo, which works well on my baby fine, thinning hair, and doesn&#x27;t over-dry it.  </li>
      <li>I had tried EVERYTHING before, including multiple rounds of antibiotics and every kind of scalp treatment, shampoo, etc.</li>
      <li>After blow-drying my hair is shiny, easy to manage, and stays super soft and frizz-free for days after a quick flat-iron.</li>
      <li>I honestly could not believe the difference it was starting to make.</li>
      <li>I felt relief right after first wash!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy that any negatives pale in comparison to the effectiveness.  </li>

      <li>how comfortable my scalp feels has been remarkable, especially in such a short time.  </li>
      <li>It must have some mighty strong essential oils in order to cause more hair loss, or I&#x27;m just extremely sensitive to the product.  </li>
      <li>I am a 37-year old woman, so losing my hair has been a huge issue for me and has affected me tremendously.  </li>
      <li>I notice my hair feels cleaner, a different kind of clean that seems to stay cleaner longer as I now am able to skip a few days between washes.</li>
      <li>After the first use the rash went away.</li>
      <li>After all these years, these are the first products I&#x27;ve tried that have made any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, my hair just isn&#x27;t as soft and manageable when I skip using this, so now I primarily use this as it NEVER builds up, and NEVER disappoints me.</li>
      <li>I would encourage people to first try tea tree oil shampoo and conditioner, before they purchase this.  </li>
      <li>I was pretty hopeless until some internet research led me to believe demodex might be the culprit.</li>
      <li>so now I use another shampoo first, then  it will lather well</li>
      <li>After all these years, these are the first products I&#x27;ve tried that have made any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now for about 2 weeks I consistently lose about 10 hairs in the shower.  </li>
      <li>I married a stubborn Italian/German man.</li>
      <li>However, my hair just isn&#x27;t as soft and manageable when I skip using this, so now I primarily use this as it NEVER builds up, and NEVER disappoints me.</li>
      <li>but you need to make sure you get deep to the scalp and your ears.</li>
      <li>After years of flaking skin and tireless itching on scalp and beard all gone after first two days and with continued use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A must by if u have been falsely diagnosed for scalp ring worms or scabies ! A must buy!</li>
    <li> This product has been largely ineffective, they don&#x27;t make it quite strong enough on purpose because all they care about is taking your money</li>
    <li> Demodex Control™ Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;I used this shampo and it killed off the mites on my face, scalp and body with in 24 hours after use. I highly recommend using  Demodex Control™ products!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With in 72 hours after use-zero inching, zero symptoms, skin is clearing up!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is good when your not itching to death :)</li>
    <li> save your money I need to get a refund</li>
    <li> My scalp is cleared up and does not itch anymore.  Very good product</li>
    <li> Good product, strong odor, but  stops itching and lasts a while</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo makes my hair shiny clean soft with body and helps lots with itching .What ever is causing it?  A little costly so now I use another shampoo first, then  it will lather well and I leave it on while I shower I&#x27;m ordering it again</li>
    <li> Did not stop my scalp itch at all.  Neither a good or bad shampoo, but I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product. Great results</li>
    <li> make my scalp hurt like crazy</li>
    <li> Like so many other people who have commented on this product, I have also had an extraordinarily itchy head with extreme hair loss for months.  I am a 37-year old woman, so losing my hair has been a huge issue for me and has affected me tremendously.  I used to have super thick hair, and it has decreased by at least 50%.  After extensive research, I found out about demodex mites.  Since I have had a red face for about a year now, I was 100% convinced I found the issue.  I was even more excited to find this product with amazing reviews.  Even though it was quite expensive, I figured it would be worth every penny if it stopped all my problems.  So, I used it for the first time last night, so perhaps it hasn&#x27;t been long enough, but most positive reviewers said they felt immediate results - well not me.  I put it on and it began to itch like crazy, so I figured it was working and the mites were going bonkers.  It itched a little before I went to sleep, but the main issue is ALWAYS during the day.  Well, it&#x27;s the next day and my head feels exactly the same.  The same itch and the same creepy crawly sensation.  I hope hope HOPE that with more use it all begins to go away and my hair begins to grow back, but for now....no relief.  The ONLY plus is that my hair looks very pretty today, it just smells awful.</li>
    <li> I did not see any beneficial or negative result.</li>
    <li> weeks of using this product as described has not changed my situation.  Every 10 day or so I get another outbreak.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is so dry and raw from whatever &amp;#34;agent&amp;#34; is used to kill them, that I am nervous about harming my hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;Going to doctor to see what they say</li>
    <li> This shampoo is helping me -- a lo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had an itchy scalp for years, and rosacea, too.  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried has helped; it just kept getting worse and worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day, I read an article (http://jonbarron.org/article/mites-and-rosacea#.VTlRj5MapOY) that talked about studies that have shown that many rosacea sufferers have an overgrowth of the microscopic skin mites that nearly all of us have on our skin.  The article recommended trying this soap: (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VTZZUA/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and mentioned shampoo, too, for the overgrowth of mites on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit hesitant, since so many other products had failed to help me.  But the article was written by Jon Barron, an alternative health researcher whose work I trust, so I decide to go forward.  I ordered two bars of the soap, one for in the shower and one for my bathroom sink.  I also ordered this shampoo, which claims to control these microscopic skin mites on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using both of these these products for three days now.  This is day four. I use the soap twice a day, once in the morning when I shower, and again when I wash my face just before I go to bed.  I use the shampoo every day, when I shower.  I&#x27;m following all directions as closely as I can, leaving the products on for a few minutes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference immediately.  Within a day or two, my scalp had stopped itching and had lost whatever those little bumps were that were making it itch!  The soap is working too:  The rosacea on my face is at least 33% improved.  I still can&#x27;t believe my eyes, when I look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never say that either the shampoo or the soap are lovely products, but I was looking for something that works, and they do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t get discouraged!  The first day or two, the shampoo hardly foamed up at all and left my hair feeling dry and heavy, like there was still soap in my hair.  However, yesterday was much better.  Perhaps the shampoo was removing residue from my previous hair-care products?  I don&#x27;t know, but this shampoo is foaming now, and my hair feels clean and more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, a little of this shampoo goes a long way, so I&#x27;m feeling more comfortable about the high price tag. But then, I&#x27;d have paid most anything for a product that worked, considering all the money I&#x27;ve wasted on products that don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers have noted, the shampoo has a weird fragrance, kind of earthy and medicinal, but the scent is not all that strong or all that bad.  And it&#x27;s true that the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m trying to be very careful about recontamination, so I&#x27;m changing my pillowcase every evening, before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The improvement in how comfortable my scalp feels has been remarkable, especially in such a short time.  The soap is working wonders on the rosacea, too.  After all these years, these are the first products I&#x27;ve tried that have made any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy that any negatives pale in comparison to the effectiveness.  I was looking for products that work, and these are working great-- so five stars it is!my hair.  However, yesterday was much better.

    <li> I bought this because I have been having relatively minor but annoying demodex symptoms on my face, neck/shoulders (blackheads and pimples) and also, my scalp (dandruff and itching, and my hair seemed to get thinner). I would expect my hair to get greasy after two days, and my head just never seemed to get REALLY clean despite shampooing it twice all the time. I thought it had to be the iron content of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was in for a new experience when I used this shampoo. WOW!!!! I cannot even tell you - words will not suffice to convey how amazing my head has felt since I have used this! And yes, I followed the instructions meticulously.&lt;br /&gt;My head felt cleaner than EVER - or since I remember! After the first application - no dandruff!!!! My hair is so voluminous and shiny, what kind of magic is this stuff??? It is the fourth day now after I washed my hair and it is still clean, fluffy, not greasy at all, and the skin on my head feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely thank the makers of the best shampoo I have ever had. It is important to me to look great, and my hair finally looks wonderful again. THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like how it keeps my hair soft, clean and manageable.</li>
    <li> Again could not tolerate the smell,  out it goes.</li>
    <li> Do you have D. folliculorum or plain old itchy scalp? I had rosacea in 2001. Amoxicillin makes it go away and it comes right back. I&#x27;d already been wearing a hat. There is now way that I&#x27;m going to take a 28 day course of amoxicillin every other month; my gut is sensitive enough already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began washing my face with Dove for sensitive skin for half a minute (timed) twice a day. After the whole summer went by with no recurrence I felt that I was onto something. I already read enough to suspect that the demodex mite could be a vector for the bacteria. A dermatologist suggested that the facial washing (I had changed to 45 seconds once a day (a really long time)) might be improving the condition of my skin. Keep in mind that their was nothing in medical literature connecting rosacea with demodex at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I drove the demodex mite from my face to my scalp and ears; perhaps not. It is surely worth washing with this shampoo until the bottle is empty to see if it reduces my scalp and ear itchiness. For a ling time after getting the rosscea under control I felt compelled to touch my face much too often. That went away by itself. I&#x27;ll update this when the bottle is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned that it was not particularly strong since some dandruff shampoos cause burning, and you surely don&#x27;t want them running down your neck, etc. while sitting in the bathtub. I found that wasn&#x27;t a problem. I washed everything else while waiting for this stuff to work, then rinsed completely before a nice long soak.</li>
    <li> It takes allot of shampoos to work but i still have the itching and the Demodex.I guess it loosens it up .The only thing is the price is to high for this product.</li>
    <li> It works!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I do love it, works for dandruff and itchy scalp.  But I believe demodex mites can develop defense to this.  Works wonderfully for initial treatment.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner did not cure the problem for me. It was a waste of money, maybe it works for others</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from constant scalp itching for many years, the type of itch that it does not matter how often or how clean I wash my hair, it still itches like crazy. It got to a point where my hair would still itch during and after shampooing. I thought maybe it was the shampoo, but switching brands did not make a difference. At night it would get worse. I also have oily scalp with sebum plugs and some hair loss. Scalp was red too. Tried anti-dandruffs and anti-fungals, did not work. I was pretty hopeless until some internet research led me to believe demodex might be the culprit. I bought this shampoo after reading good reviews and am happy to say this shampoo really does work! The itch went away after a few washes and hasn&#x27;t come back ever since. My scalp is no longer red and it felt cleaner even though it does not contain the usual SLS. On top of it, my hair loss has reduced dramatically, half the amount I usually lose. I highly recommend this shampoo to people who experience scalp itching and could not find a clear cause for it. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Thank god, this product stopped my scalp from constant itching (particularly my crown). I tried anti-fungals and none worked. This worked. I guess it was Demodex then. Thank you so much, this is the first time my scalp has not been constantly bothering me.&lt;br /&gt;Edit... Ive been using it now for a few more weeks. I just want to say, most of my \\&quot;pimples\\&quot; on my head have gone away (except 1). I had 5 of them. I was also losing about 50 hairs on my hands when in the shower and shampooing, I was counting them because I was balding. I was trying to figure out why all of the sudden I was losing so much. Now for about 2 weeks I consistently lose about 10 hairs in the shower.  The itching has nearly stopped. I am so relieved, and grateful for this product! I will keep using it just because its such a relief. Im also allergic to dust mites, cats and dogs, so I dunno if that means I also have an allergy to demodex. I just want to say thank you so much for (nearly) stopping my itching, itching, itching. Now the only thing that itches is my eye brows and eye lashes. I don&#x27;t know if I can put it there...</li>
    <li> I had a breakout on my scalp of some sort and this was reccomended.  It was quite pricey between pthe product cost an shipping and did not do a thing for my problem.  It may work fine for what it was intended for, but did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Very soothing. Doesn&#x27;t dry out hair.</li>
    <li> I just ordered second bottle of demodex control shampoo and added hair conditioner. Right away (few weeks ago) when I first ordered the shampoo I was very surprised as to how fast the itchiness stopped. I felt relief right after first wash! I have very itchy scalp due to the demodex mites and it got to the point that I started noticing lots of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo really helped- in just one wash to stop the itching and I am starting to notice that my hair loss problem stopped as well.  I also use their demodex face cream and have to tell you that it is a lifesaver if you straggling with demodex on the face. The cream is a killer; it destroys the mites fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these product to all with demodex.</li>
    <li> I tell you, those demedex mites are a b****. Me and a friend both have them. Using the shampoo creates relief when I use it. But to be honest, I also put hand sanitizer and kleen green spray on my hair as well. So......Im not sure how good it is, but I do know this for sure, my friend has had these mites for 2 years and I shared some of my shampoo with them. They are going to buy another bottle for themselves. So, they are a better to answer the question on how good it is. For me, tonite before I go to bed, I will shower and use the shampoo.....it does work.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical how well this would work, after using Nizoral with minimal results. After the first use, the irritating, crawly feeling stopped. Within 3 days, the redness/acne had cleared about 75%. Very effective and useful.</li>
    <li> I was using many products for almost two years without significant results this is very helpful product I strongly recommend to use it for itchy scalp</li>
    <li> The use of Demodex Shampoo has stopped my hair from falling out in chunks very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Felt good on scalp. Dried out my hair. Was not effective for me. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Sooo happy... Suffered so long with crazy non stop itching... Literally worked after one washing-(follow directions) had a slight itch a week later and got nervous it was coming back so I reused ... Feel totally back to normal ... Super highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> One application stopped the mysterious itching. The added bonus was my hair was silky and tangle free after using the shampoo with the Demodex  conditioner. There was a residual odor for 24 hours so I would not recommend using it when you have an important engagement. I had been suffering with hair loss and a painfully itchy scalp. My doctors could not see mites or inflammation. A change in diet nor homeopathic treatments worked for me in stopping or easing the itching. Demodex did not stop my hair loss but I have not had a re-occurrence of the itching since the initial use several months ago. My itching was not only annoying but painful in the crown of my head. I am keeping Demodex on hand just in case. This product worked for me when nothing else OTC did. I have bra length wavy hair that is color treated but not processed with other chemicals. My hair is fragile. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Cleans scalp well.  I couldn&#x27;t tell if I had the mite problem or not, so I used this anyway.  Nice, clean feeling.</li>
    <li> CURED chronic scalp inflammation &amp; itchiness with first use!  Nothing else ever worked.  This stuff is simply amazing!  If you&#x27;ve suffered with an itchy/painful scalp that never goes away, then you owe it to yourself to at least try this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, but it killed whatever plagued my scalp for years.  It&#x27;s not cheap at $25 for 6 oz...But it&#x27;s cheaper than another worthless trip to another Dermatologist.</li>
    <li> doctor recommended and worked well</li>
    <li> For year I tried every product out there to fight what I thought was dandruff.  I knew I was allergic to house dust and its mites. Dispute vacuuming daily I still needed claratiine-D. This stopped the sneezing but not the rash. I decided to try this to rid the rash on my arms. After the first use the rash went away. Then one day while watering the 40+ plants my husband insists on fill our home with, I noticed little red spiders on the heavier foliage plants. I looked this bug up and found it was a mite. Turns out that every time I touched these plants the mites attracted themselves to me. I would wipe my face or rub my arms and them are to tiny to see let alone kill since I couldn&#x27;t see them without my reading glasses.  Like dust mites they eat our dead skin and burrow into broken skin from scratching.  After 33 days I had relief. After 2 weeks I had no scaling.  I use it 1 a week to keep it under control but you need to make sure you get deep to the scalp and your ears. The back base of my head was the worst.  I told my husband not to bring anymore plants home but that just flush over his head. So I will continue to smell like sulfur (which he doesnt care for) instead of  sweet flowers. He has dandruff so bad he scrapes his scalp with a butter knife.  I&#x27;ve tried to get him to.try this product be he says he would rather itch them smell like a rest station. I married a stubborn Italian/German man. Some day I pray he sees the thru that. stubborn streak.  I recommend you give it a try. You won&#x27;t waist it. It&#x27;s. good fi r psor</li>
    <li> I bought for my daughter she  like , help her to stoppet  scraping.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  My son has severe seborrheic dermatitis, which causes embarrassing dandruff, and dry skin on his face.  He has had it for 2 years.  I have repeatedly taken him to the dermatologist and he has been given several rounds of steroids and many different shampoos and creams.  Most of the shampoos smell terrible and they don&#x27;t work.  While researching his problem online I came to the conclusion that the demodex mite was causing the problem.  I purchased  the Demodex shampoo and lotion.  I have been using them for 2 months now.  The dandruff  is under control and his face looks much better.  Thank you so much for having something available that actually works and smells good.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for almost a year now, and this is by far the best shampoo I have ever used (ranging from my use of many salon grade shampoos to drugstore brands). My primary doctor and dermatologist could not figure out the severe itching I was experiencing with my scalp. The first instinctual diagnosis was dandruff, but none of those familiar dandruff shampoos worked. They actually dried out my hair and made the itching worse. I then tried salon grade tea tree oil shampoos and that did not help either and made the itching worse as well. For years in my mid-twenties, I could not for the life of me figure out what was going on, and the itching was enough to disrupt my daily life. After years of trying different remedies and products, I came across an article about demodex mites and itchy scalp. I immediately began looking up solutions for itchiness caused by demodex mites and came across this shampoo. The idea of mites sounded crazy, but I figured of all the things I have already tried, why not one more? After the first wash I noticed an immediate difference and after a few washes my itching had subsided significantly. I honestly could not believe the difference it was starting to make. After a couple weeks of daily use, the itching had completely stopped. It has been almost a year now, and this shampoo has been absolutely great. I notice my hair feels cleaner, a different kind of clean that seems to stay cleaner longer as I now am able to skip a few days between washes. Before using this, I would not have dared going more than 24 hours without washing my hair due to the constant itch. Now my long locks definitely stay cleaner longer with no issues of residue, build-up, or itching, and I actually feel normal again. I cannot say how much this product has changed my life (which sounds ridiculous), but it truly has. One bottle lasts me about a month, but I also have long, thick hair. After blow-drying my hair is shiny, easy to manage, and stays super soft and frizz-free for days after a quick flat-iron. The only thing I had to get used to is the smell. I can best describe it as an \\&quot;organic\\&quot; smell. Considering the nourishing and natural ingredients, the smell is expected. Upon my first time opening the bottle (which is double-sealed for freshness) I was weary of the smell, but I have actually grown to really like it. I now find it to be awakening and refreshing. Now that the itch is gone, I have tried going back to salon-grade shampoos and using this once a week. However, my hair just isn&#x27;t as soft and manageable when I skip using this, so now I primarily use this as it NEVER builds up, and NEVER disappoints me. It also does a great job at removing product build-up leftover from other products. I honestly can&#x27;t say enough great things about this shampoo. I truly hope Amazon continues to offer this shampoo with free Prime shipping. Give it a try, it may work for you too!z-free for days after a quick flat-iron.

    <li> My eye Dr.  Said it was helping.</li>
    <li> Demodex Mites Shampoo for Humans worked for me and I have allergy to dust mites.  My scalp does not itch and is not flaky; other regular shampoo did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have an itchy scalp and rosacea, both signs of demodex.  I was surprised that the bottle of shampoo was so small but a little goes a long way. I have used it every couple of days for the last three months and I have seen a reduction in my scalp itchiness so I think it is working. I just bought another bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bee using this over a month now, bottle is half way gone and I have shoulder length hair.  To be fair when I use it I just use enough to coat my scalp and I don&#x27;t work it through the rest of the hair.  It rinses out clean and my hair is soft, shiny and bouncy.  I use this in conjunction with the other products from this line.  I bought it because I have rosacea and I had read that when you treat demodex on the face they may migrate to the hair, and I didn&#x27;t want to take the chance, so it&#x27;s preventative really.  I&#x27;ve never really had scalp problems so I can&#x27;t comment on whether this really works or not.  So far so good and my face is clear, for the first time in at least 4 years.</li>
    <li> I purchase this shampoo because I had scabies. I never had scabies before and searched the internet for solutions on how to get rid of them. Figured if this gets rid of demodex mites in hair it might help with scabies on skin. IT DID HELP!! I used it with a very soft brush all over, also used sulfur soap. No scabies left but I do keep it in the shower just in case. Be sure to use a moisturizer after using a few times, can be drying.  Be very careful not to get it in your eyes. There is a slight smell to the shampoo. I would recommend it. Worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Leaves scalp feeling clean, stops itching and I bought this treatment shampoo because I believe I had what you call spider mites that make your scalp itch and your hair fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mites live in the hair folicals and litterally eat your hair........this shampoo STOPPED IT and I HIGHLY recomend it!!!</li>
    <li> More effective than the shampoo. It extends the effect of the shampoo and prevents itching and redness for about 1-2 more days. Stinks like sulfur to a repulsive degree. But it helps. It wasn&#x27;t a cure for me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo caused major burning and irritation from the first use!  After a couple uses I noticed a crazy amount of hair loss and visible thinning in my hairline.  I lost about 50% of my bangs!  I never had a problem like this before using this shampoo.  I instantly returned the product.  I&#x27;m a 32 year old woman and now i have to worry about how to fix my hair to hide my noticeably bald, thinning hair!  I also bought the face wash and it tore my face up!  My face and neck was raw for a week after using it.  The entire top layer of my skin scuffed off of my face and neck!  Warning people!  This has majorly strong essential oils and it is just way too strong for some sensitive scalps and skin.  Now I&#x27;m just praying my hair grows back fast!</li>
    <li> Lathers well, Gives hair body</li>
    <li> After years of flaking skin and tireless itching on scalp and beard all gone after first two days and with continued use.</li>
    <li> As  advertised and takes away scalp itchiness.</li>
    <li> Good for managing symptoms but does not kill demodex.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wast your time ot money on this....did nothin....</li>
    <li> Went to Thailand and my hair started feeling out like crazy. Thought it was the hardness of the water. WRONG!!! My sister had the same problem. Half our our hair fell out and we couldnt figure out what was going on.&lt;br /&gt;This product fixed both of our hair- falling out and shine in the first two uses. Sort of expensive but overly worth it!!! If you have been to south east Asia and have hair problems GET THIS!!</li>
    <li> works great with regular use</li>
    <li> I was using Trader Joes Tea Tree Tingle shampoo and conditioner for about $4 each, which was recommended for Demodex mites.  I found the hair loss slowed and then I switched to this shampoo because I thought if it was specifically formulated for Demodex infestation, it must do a better job.  That was totally wrong.  The first time I used it, I had a little more hair loss and some mild face and eye irritation, and by the forth time, major hair loss once again.  I am extremely unhappy with this product, and felt it was necessary to write this review (my very first).  I would encourage people to first try tea tree oil shampoo and conditioner, before they purchase this.  It must have some mighty strong essential oils in order to cause more hair loss, or I&#x27;m just extremely sensitive to the product.  I&#x27;ll be going back to using 50 percent tea tree oil diluted in 50 percent macadamia oil for my face and body and Trader Joes hair products which lather well and the shampoo can double as a body wash.  What do you have to lose at $4 a bottle?  I think it&#x27;s a little more through Amazon.  I&#x27;m going back to all things Tea Tree.</li>
    <li> I had suffered for more than 5 years with folliculitis and acne-like bumps on my scalp, which started after an overnight hospital stay.  I had tried EVERYTHING before, including multiple rounds of antibiotics and every kind of scalp treatment, shampoo, etc. I could find.  This is the only product that actually worked.  I don&#x27;t know if I had mites or what, but using this daily for three months has completely cleared my scalp.  It&#x27;s a gentle shampoo, which works well on my baby fine, thinning hair, and doesn&#x27;t over-dry it.  It smells a bit medicinal, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.  You only need a small amount, so the bottle lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve been using the face wash, too, which also seems to help.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to get past the smell.  BUT, it hasn&#x27;t hurt my hair.  It does drain the color, but it takes care of the problem.  If you have dry hair, I think you should get the conditioner.</li>
    <li> worked but made hair, tangled and knotted due to extreme dryness!</li>
    <li> TOO EARLY TO COMMENT!</li>
    <li> The Dermodex Shampoo used with Dermadex conditioner was effective as a treatment for dermatophytosis. Itchy scalp with dandruff did not resolve obviously with the first treatment, but improved dramatically by the second week.</li>
