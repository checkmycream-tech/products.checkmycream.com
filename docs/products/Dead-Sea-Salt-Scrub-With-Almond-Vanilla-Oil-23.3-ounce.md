      <li>This is a great product, just the right combination of oil and scrub.</li>
      <li>The grains of salt seem to dissolve too quickly so you don&#x27;t get a good scrub.  </li>
      <li>I like the salt scrubs better than the sugar scrubs.  </li>
      <li>I cannot say for sure if this product was a contributing factor, but I will not purchase again.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>

      <li>I will buy it again, but only because the best one out there was discontinued by Upper Canada.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what a salt scrub should be!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t return it because it wasn&#x27;t worth the fuss, oh well.</li>
      <li>Scrub works well, especially on feet, but very strong scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, I just expected a better scrub before the salt dissolved.</li>
      <li>Wanted to try something more budget friendly, but this was not a success.</li>
      <li>When I used it in the shower, the floor was very slippery</li>
      <li>but it is VERY oily.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely worth a try and the price is great compared to other brands of dead sea salt...</li>
      <li>I tried this scrub because I couldn&#x27;t find a particular brand of gingerbread</li>
      <li>This product has a high salt content which I like</li>
      <li>fragrance of this salt scrub was very mild and the scrub worked wonders on my back using a back brush.  </li>
      <li>and I needed to clean it afterwards to avoid slipping.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels very soft and pampered.</li>
      <li>The Almond oil is a little slick after bathing on the skin but the smell is great and it makes your skin soft.</li>
      <li>Not nearly as good as another sea salt scrub that I love.  </li>

<li> The smell is subtle and not very over powering in the way certain almond scents tend to be.</li>
<li> I add a little bit of foaming soap with it before I scrub my hands, otherwise it does not spread out evenly and is too rough on some areas and misses other areas completely.</li>
<li> I could feel the difference and see the dead skin on my back.</li>
<li> A lot of people in their reviews of Dead Sea scrub products mentioned that packaging ruined their product for them and the bottles arrived with cracks and leaks and no oil left.</li>
<li> However, the lid arrived cracked, which made it problematic because I can&#x27;t close it properly, and while they haven&#x27;t dried out, I expect they will over time without the lid closing tightly.</li>
<li> The oil with it is thick, the salt granules coarse enough to scrub but not too hard on the skin.</li>

    <li> This is a great product, it makes your skin feel super soft and silky. It is definitely worth a try and the price is great compared to other brands of dead sea salt...</li>
    <li> Great scent, lots of mineral moisture, good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  I&#x27;ve never used one of these salt scrubs on my body, I&#x27;ve always tried them in rest rooms in restaurants and have only used on my hands.  The grains of salt seem to dissolve too quickly so you don&#x27;t get a good scrub.  It&#x27;s not bad, I just expected a better scrub before the salt dissolved.</li>
    <li> Been using this once a week all summer and I love it.  My skin looks healthier and much younger.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very good value. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Aroma is wonderful and very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I tried this scrub because I couldn&#x27;t find a particular brand of gingerbread scrub.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of this salt scrub was very mild and the scrub worked wonders on my back using a back brush.  I could feel the difference and see the dead skin on my back. I may purchase again.</li>

    <li> Not nearly as good as another sea salt scrub that I love.  Wanted to try something more budget friendly, but this was not a success.</li>
    <li> It works well, but not by itself. I add a little bit of foaming soap with it before I scrub my hands, otherwise it does not spread out evenly and is too rough on some areas and misses other areas completely. I will buy it again, but only because the best one out there was discontinued by Upper Canada.</li>
    <li> Just what we ordered.My wife is ecstatic</li>
    <li> Great product  and great for sensitive skin also.  Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Nice a little drying of skin but nice</li>
    <li> Tried it today, the aroma is delicio9us, and the salt and oils pampered my skin.</li>
    <li> The bath salts themselves are absolutely wonderful. However, the lid arrived cracked, which made it problematic because I can&#x27;t close it properly, and while they haven&#x27;t dried out, I expect they will over time without the lid closing tightly.

    <li> A lot of people in their reviews of Dead Sea scrub products mentioned that packaging ruined their product for them and the bottles arrived with cracks and leaks and no oil left. I had no such experience! My package arrived with so much protective air pouches that I honestly wondered if they forgot to put the bottle in! The product is fantastic. It is exactly what a salt scrub should be! The oil with it is thick, the salt granules coarse enough to scrub but not too hard on the skin. The effects after rinsing are beautiful. My skin feels very soft and pampered. The smell is subtle and not very over powering in the way certain almond scents tend to be. The cent doesn&#x27;t stay in too long though. But that&#x27;s great because you can effectively layer your other lotions/moisturizers after a good scrub. All in all a wonderful product experience.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft, smells good, would buy again</li>
    <li> not the vanilla smell I was looking for</li>
    <li> Great product, has the right amount of scrub and oil.  My skin felt wonderful after use, I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Smells nice. Not too abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;works great. After one week my skin feels great.&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to wash your hair and face and well you know. Then I turn shore off and use the salt scrub. Then turn shower back on to rinse. Pat dry so not to wipe oil off.</li>
