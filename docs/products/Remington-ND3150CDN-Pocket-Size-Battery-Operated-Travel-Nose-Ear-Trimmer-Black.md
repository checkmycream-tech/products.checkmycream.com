      <li>Good afternoon, I received, thank you very much for the product.</li>
      <li>It was cheap and it works OK.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The two pieces come apart to easily.</li>
      <li>I actually ordered these for a professional barber who says they are the best for her kind of work.</li>
      <li>Doesent get the fine hairs, still need a tweezers to get those</li>
      <li>The trimmer works fine.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an eyebrow trimmer or quick clean-up, can&#x27;t go worng with this one!</li>
      <li>Oh well, it was cheap.</li>
      <li>These are common items and the family has tried many, but this one holds up and works great!  </li>
      <li>Early is good.</li>
      <li>Works just as expected, good!</li>
      <li>This one works as well as my original.</li>
      <li>Unless you aim perfectly would not work and the head is very small.</li>
      <li>It does NOT trim nose hair adequately.  </li>
      <li>He uses it often and it gets rid of the pesky nose hairs quickly.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t think I would find another one exactly like it until I saw it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Have purchased similar product costing more and now I see why.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>2011,  Some time after reviewing the first time, some plastic parts broke (had to tape the battery \\&quot;lid\\&quot; on.</li>
      <li>Not that good place to cut hair is 3 mm wide not able to really cut many.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the on off technique as much as more positive switches on other trimmers.</li>
      <li>I really like this trimmer.  </li>
      <li>Thanks and let&#x27;s see.  </li>
      <li>The price is quite reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer this type of trimmer rather than the rotary type.</li>
      <li>It is battery operated, so no fussing with cords, and it does not take up much space.  </li>
      <li>EVEN WHEN IT RAN, IT DID NOT CUT VERY WELL.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not all that wild about the twisting on/off switch and would have preferred a more traditional switch.</li>
      <li>Does not work as my last one that is about 10 years old and still works better than this one.</li>
      <li>Decent item but</li>
      <li>This was supposed to be smaller than most but is approx the same.</li>
      <li>My Barber highly recommends this product.</li>
      <li>The side action of this trimmer doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned a few nose/ear trimmers over the years and found most rotary style trimmers to be noisy Machiavellian torture tools that ripped my nose hairs out by the roots, leaving my ears ringing and my eyes gushing water.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll order a new one.</li>
      <li>so I have to find a new one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m at this site writing because I plan to buy a new one.</li>
      <li>They are very cheaply made and only last a short time, before #1 just stopped working and #2</li>
      <li>You are better off using a small scissor instead.</li>
      <li>price was right, works well and battery life lasts for a long time.  </li>
      <li>that my previous trimmer and is pleasantly light to hold.  </li>
      <li>I finally got smart and bought this; it works so well.</li>
      <li>Low price, yet works very well.</li>
      <li>I used my last one so much</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember if my old one was a Remington or not.</li>
      <li>So for convenience sake, we ordered 3 when his old one (about 10 yrs old) stopped working.</li>
      <li>My old one broke</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at this inexpensive nose/ ear trimmer.  </li>
      <li>It works better than other more expensive rotaries that I have used.</li>
      <li>Not a big deal and not really a complaint.  </li>
      <li>I have gone through 2 of them already with very light usage, a black narrow one and a silver one just like this one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are common items and the family has tried many, but this one holds up and works great!  Only has the small straight-edge trimmer, but works well and consistently.  If you&#x27;re looking for an eyebrow trimmer or quick clean-up, can&#x27;t go worng with this one!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT SELLER AND PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> It is not the instrument&#x27;s fault, but I wish I had one with wider blades.</li>
    <li> Product works well enough.  My only complaint is that when I twist the bottom to turn off, I usually end up twisting too far and the battery falls out.</li>
    <li> ITEM FAILED TO WORK OUT OF BOX AFTER BATTERY INSTALLMENT. I HAD TO REMOVE HEAD TO GET MOTOR TO RUN. EVEN WHEN IT RAN, IT DID NOT CUT VERY WELL.</li>
    <li> This model is designed for linear cutting, similar to those linear (sideburn/nech) cutters found on electric shavers, but much smaller.  For nose and ear use, it&#x27;s very difficult to use. You cant just rotate it around, but cut against the hairs. And it does it badly. Have even cut my self a couple of times.  The only thing it can do without to much trouble, is trimming eyebrows and other tiny flat surfaces.  EDIT October 8. 2011,  Some time after reviewing the first time, some plastic parts broke (had to tape the battery \\&quot;lid\\&quot; on. Now, the cutting blades has come loose and partially don&#x27;t work. I no longer dear using it. Horrible build quality. I added this edit because of if anyone should hurt them self using it.</li>
    <li> Decent item but doesn&#x27;t work as good as I hoped. I was trying to replace a similar item that I had that no longer worked.</li>
    <li> Worst Amazon purchase to date.  Takes forever to trim.  Gave up and purchased a better design.</li>
    <li> Good afternoon, I received, thank you very much for the product. arrived in excellent condition</li>
    <li> Perfect, price is wow!</li>
    <li> Not that good place to cut hair is 3 mm wide not able to really cut many.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful.  For years I&#x27;ve thought about buying this type of products, but one always thinks it is a thing for men.  I finally got sick of trimming nose hair with scissors, and now and then nicking myself.  I finally got smart and bought this; it works so well.</li>
    <li> Works just as expected, good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few nose/ear trimmers over the years and found most rotary style trimmers to be noisy Machiavellian torture tools that ripped my nose hairs out by the roots, leaving my ears ringing and my eyes gushing water. So when I saw the Remington with its back and forth trimmer head, I decided to try it. I&#x27;ve had mine for a bunch of years now, and it recently quit working. I&#x27;m at this site writing because I plan to buy a new one. The trimmer has never pulled a single hair, and is quieter than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used. Also, it seems to be totally safe. I can use it without worry of it cutting my skin. It just cuts the hairs. I&#x27;ve had a very good experience with mine. I think I&#x27;ll order a new one.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. The round tips work, but I wanted one like this. To me it does a better job and you get a closer cut.</li>
    <li> gets closer to the skin than the other trimmers. Gets the ears and nose hairs. One AA battery (not included) lasts forever.</li>
    <li> It is the best I have ever had!</li>
    <li> Just wanted to warn you all, DO NOT buy a Remington nose hair trimmer. You will be sorry. I have gone through 2 of them already with very light usage, a black narrow one and a silver one just like this one. Each one cost me about $20 at the pharmacy. They are very cheaply made and only last a short time, before #1 just stopped working and #2: cheap plastic switch broke off (it will not reattach back on to the unit) making it useless. Only 1 year warranty &amp; they break shortly after that. I only used them once or twice a month, handled them very gently, never dropped them.</li>
    <li> Shipper sent product on time. This was supposed to be smaller than most but is approx the same. The side action of this trimmer doesn&#x27;t work very well. It takes repeated tries to actually do the job. A rotarry trimmer works a lot better and faster. My old one broke so I have to find a new one.</li>
    <li> As the saying goes you get what you pay for. It was cheap and it works OK. Have purchased similar product costing more and now I see why.</li>
    <li> Just what i wanted good service</li>
    <li> This trimmer works for me. I got a Remington years ago and tried to find another when it died. I ended up with a different brand that I did not like so I was happy when I found this one. This one works as well as my original.</li>
    <li> Thank You Amazon.com LLC! What a surprise to open the door and seeing the package outside. The package wasn&#x27;t due til,around the 10th and it arrived on the 4th instead. Early is good. Thanks and let&#x27;s see.  . . .it didn&#x27;t arrive with batteries. . . .I was prepared, I have a couple.&lt;br /&gt;Hey,! Hey,! Hey,! it works good. Snip buzz clip snip buzz lol.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again. My hearing went up 1/3rd at least. I can heear better. lol&lt;br /&gt;Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;Mark</li>
    <li> I purchased this Remington Nose hair trimmer for my husband. It does work well, however it stops and malfunctions a bit too often. Almost like a bad hair clipper set. It stops with out warning some times before it has even reached the nose! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, it is really not worth the money. When it is in working order it does a good job.</li>
    <li> Works very well and is an excellent buy. I much prefer this type of trimmer rather than the rotary type.</li>
    <li> Low price, yet works very well.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews prior to buying this but figured for 5 bucks I can handle the disappointment. One of the reviews mentioned the blade on this trimmer was so small as to render it relatively useless. Its not altogether useless ... I can cut about one nose or ear hair at a time. I bought this because I had a Remington trimmer that was great and lasted years and hoped this would be a good replacement despite what I read.  At least it hasn&#x27;t made me bleed ... like scissors. For THAT it gets 2 Stars.</li>
    <li> It is a nose hair trimmer, which is what I bought it for, and it does the job, well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick, and the trimmer arrived in perfect condition. Install one AA battery and it functions as advertised.</li>
    <li> Tried changing batteries and turning the switch to on and off several times. Oh well, it was cheap. Will try to find a better quality device.</li>
    <li> Great product for my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Doesent get the fine hairs, still need a tweezers to get those</li>
    <li> Does not work as my last one that is about 10 years old and still works better than this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased at my husband&#x27;s request and he loves it. He uses it often and it gets rid of the pesky nose hairs quickly. It&#x27;s a good quality trimmer at a good price.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works fine. I don&#x27;t like the on off technique as much as more positive switches on other trimmers.</li>
    <li> Does its job, in removing ear hair.</li>
    <li> price was right, works well and battery life lasts for a long time.  The only con is that sometimes when you twist to turn on, you accidently twist open the unit.  Not a big deal and not really a complaint.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product works well ..... I would have given it 5 stars but I&#x27;m not all that wild about the twisting on/off switch and would have preferred a more traditional switch.</li>
    <li> There is so much extra room inside my nose now.</li>
    <li> Husband had one of these trimmer and used it ALL the time.  Infact, he travels and would take it with him.  Also he takes it to the camper and also uses it at home.  So for convenience sake, we ordered 3 when his old one (about 10 yrs old) stopped working.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at this inexpensive nose/ ear trimmer.  It does a good job for a light duty, inexpensive trimmer.  The best one that I have ever used is a &amp;#34;Conair Rotary Trimmer&#x27;.  That has the power of a jet engine and produces close to the same decibel level as well!  This trimmer, although not as effective as the Conair, gets the job done with some patience and time. It works better than other more expensive rotaries that I have used.</li>
    <li> I have used one of these for many years and find that it does a great job of trimming ear and nose hair, without creating any cuts.  It is battery operated, so no fussing with cords, and it does not take up much space.  The battery lasts for a year or more of use.  The price is quite reasonable.  I bought this one for my wife so she would not be tempted to use mine.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Takes too long to do a simple job. Unless you aim perfectly would not work and the head is very small.</li>
    <li> Better than rotary trimmers. Service and shipping were good.</li>
    <li> This shaver does the job, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close to the skin as the one I previously had.  I can&#x27;t remember if my old one was a Remington or not.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does not work!&lt;br /&gt;Not enough power to take out nose hairs without holding it on each hair.&lt;br /&gt;On/ off switch is poorly designed as you turn it off you also loosen battery door.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It cut 10 times worst than the older model that I have, so don&#x27;t buy this product.  The two pieces come apart to easily.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Remington Travel Trimmer.  It is quite effective, has a lower vibration level that my previous trimmer and is pleasantly light to hold.  I would recommend this item and I would purchase Remington products again, in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a excellent machine</li>
    <li> I suggest you avoid this one.  It does NOT trim nose hair adequately.  You are better off using a small scissor instead.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered these for a professional barber who says they are the best for her kind of work. I guess that&#x27;s the best recommendation there is for this product.  Although the order was shipped in three different shipments they all arrived in a timely manner and there were no complaints. My Barber highly recommends this product.</li>
    <li> The battery cover is also the on-off switch, so eveytime you turn it off the battery cover comes off too and the battery fall out, unless you&#x27;re very careful.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve discovered that other nose hair trimmers just do not work as well as this one.  When we were unable to find this Remington model we stepped up in price to one with a round head that never worked as well as our less expensive old one.  Now we have a new less expensive &#x27;what we wanted&#x27; one!  LOL  We like it.  ~~ deb</li>
    <li> Very happy that I could locate an ear and nose trimmer for my husband sold by itself, since most department and drug stores only include this item in a grooming set.</li>
    <li> very cheap product, but it does work</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer.  I used my last one so much I burned it out so I didn&#x27;t think I would find another one exactly like it until I saw it on Amazon.  Thank goodness.</li>
    <li> a very nice product for the traveler , works very well and i am looking for another one soon . rick</li>
    <li> I have 3 types from Remmington like this and this one will not stand on its own and falls off the shelf all the time.</li>
    <li> I like this machine.  I use it every other week.  It keeps my nose hair trimmed and me looking good.  Great nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Does not PULL the hair out of your nose like the rotary ones.  Easy to use.  Great gift for the men and women.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer for my son who have a goatee.  He loves it, it&#x27;s easy to use and works great.</li>
    <li> Works really good for the price!!!</li>
