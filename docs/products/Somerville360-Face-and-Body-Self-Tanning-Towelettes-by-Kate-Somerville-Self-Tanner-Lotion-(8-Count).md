      <li>Split the package with a friend - we both love it.</li>

      <li>- I save them for summer outings and special occasions.  </li>

      <li>Amazing, streak free, when used properly this is the ticket!!!</li>
      <li>I will now go back to a department store, where I can return the product more easily.</li>
      <li>Says they are the only kind that don&#x27;t leave streaks or come off on her clothes.  </li>
      <li>I suggest you pat the towel on your feet and ankles fo a more natural look.</li>
      <li>I need them right now type of thing.</li>
      <li>I have bought sooo many different things to achieve the perfect sunless tan and who would of thought that the solution was in a little towelette!!!</li>
      <li>was good, would recommended these to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;a little pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t permanent (nothing is), so she has to reapply every few weeks, but are great when she wants to look tan.</li>
      <li>, THIS SELF TANNER LOOKS 100% NATURAL, NO WEIRD ORDERS AND SO EASY TO USE.  </li>
      <li>would search elsewhere for a similar product that will give you more for your money.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENS!!</li>
      <li>Be sure to exfoliate first, especially your feet.</li>
      <li>and I get two more applications from the same piece.</li>
      <li>I have used these tanning towelettes for a few years and have loved them.</li>
      <li>(Large chest and bottom size.)</li>
      <li>Really go on your body well.</li>
      <li>OR THAT GIVE YOU A VERY UNNATURAL COLOR</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very competitive.</li>
      <li>Very even with no streaks.</li>
      <li>no streaks, no mess, no problems!!!</li>
      <li>BUT make sure you wear rubber gloves when putting this on - it does put an odd color on your hands if you don&#x27;t !</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t turn orange and looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply and as long as you have used a loofah prior and apply with a circular motion there are no streaks.</li>
      <li>Of course, these are more expensive (double the price), but they do a better job.  </li>
      <li>, the color is glorious and natural, and it doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes.</li>
      <li>I have told everyone I know about this product - save yourself from spending extra money at the tanning salons - this product really works.</li>
      <li>No mess.</li>
      <li>Great quality but very expensive.</li>
      <li>It looks very natural, and I especially use the towels on my white legs.  </li>

    <li> I NEED THESE, ESPECIALLY WHEN PLANNING A CRUISE OR WARM-WEATHER TRIP.    NO NEED TO &#x27;BURN&#x27; AND SIT OUT IN THE DANGEROUS SUN AGAIN!    YOUR DERMATOLOGIST WILL LOVE THESE AND YOU FOR USING  TANNING SHEETS</li>
    <li> Great, handy, self tanning towels. Be careful to apply in a circular motion!</li>
    <li> I have tried several products....to name one is Tan Towelettes sold by QVC.  They are pretty good, but they do not compare to Kate Somerville&#x27;s tan towels.  Of course, these are more expensive (double the price), but they do a better job.  It looks very natural, and I especially use the towels on my white legs.  Makes all the difference in the world.  Try them; you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have bought sooo many different things to achieve the perfect sunless tan and who would of thought that the solution was in a little towelette!!! love it!!! no streaks, no mess, no problems!!!</li>
    <li> The very BEST in self tanning!  I have tried them all and none other compares. I am fair and my legs just do not ever get dark, but these tan towels help a great deal. Very even with no streaks. I suggest you pat the towel on your feet and ankles fo a more natural look.</li>
    <li> i used 8 towelettes over 2 weeks and only noticed a slite coloring of my skin.  I was very disappointed.  I had recieved a towelette in my beauty bar monthly sample and I was impressed by just one use of this product, so I oredered a box.  I don&#x27;t know if it was a bad batch or what, but I was not happy.  I feel it was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> These towelettes are so easy to use and did not turn me orange  I had no streaking and the odor is pleasant. Be sure to exfoliate first, especially your feet.</li>
    <li> Amazing…i FREAKING LOVE these towelettes</li>
    <li> I am not the least bit tan after using this product. I have used products that were a lot cheaper and worked much better than this one! So disappointed.</li>

    <li> I purchased these towelettes last year.  Overall the product works great.  However, there were 12 to a box @ $48.00.  Now this company is trying to sell you 1/3 less for the same price--I call that a rip off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would search elsewhere for a similar product that will give you more for your money.</li>
    <li> she has me order these every few months, they are not cheap, but she swears by them.  Says they are the only kind that don&#x27;t leave streaks or come off on her clothes.  They aren&#x27;t permanent (nothing is), so she has to reapply every few weeks, but are great when she wants to look tan.</li>
    <li> Amazing, streak free, when used properly this is the ticket!!!</li>
    <li> Best product of its kind, ever!  No orange, no scent, the color is glorious and natural, and it doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes. This is what we&#x27;ve all been looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought these at the beginning of the summer.  They work superbly!  Just follow the directions and you&#x27;re golden.  :-)  Because of cost, I don&#x27;t use them all the time - I save them for summer outings and special occasions.  I have recommended them to many of my family and friends who do not want to worry about skin damage.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of this product.  Very clean and easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> these are great.  Really go on your body well.</li>
    <li> I had streaks using this</li>
    <li> I have used these tanning towelettes for a few years and have loved them. However, upon receiving my last order from Amazon, 2 of the 8 towelettes were completely dried out, the first time this has ever happened. I will now go back to a department store, where I can return the product more easily.</li>
    <li> These are the best!!!</li>
    <li> Was pleasantly surprised, good coverage for my legs,&lt;br /&gt;Im olive skinned so I was worried about the color,&lt;br /&gt;color was good, would recommended these to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;a little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Great quality but very expensive.</li>
    <li> Works in 4 hours. Lasts about a week. Great!</li>
    <li> Always amazed at your services.  Sometimes my orders are here the next day.  Again you never cease to amaze me.</li>
    <li> Want to buy medium tan</li>
    <li> EVEN TAN BETTER THAN SPRAY.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED SO MANY SELF TANNERS THAT DON&#x27;T WORK OR THAT GIVE YOU A VERY UNNATURAL COLOR, THIS SELF TANNER LOOKS 100% NATURAL, NO WEIRD ORDERS AND SO EASY TO USE.  HIGHLY RECOMMENS!!</li>
    <li> Five stars for the product itself! *HOWEVER, Some of my wipes came dried out. This time it slid because it was an I need them right now type of thing. Next time, I won&#x27;t order online though.* One towel is enough for my body 5&#x27;5, 142 pounds. (Large chest and bottom size.) no streaks, no stains, NO ORANGE! &#x27;Tan&#x27; lasts me 3 days bold color with nighty sweating from workout and nightly shower after.</li>
    <li> With out a doubt this product offers the best tanning solution available. Is it expensive? Yes! But compared to a tanning salon or spray tan it&#x27;s very competitive. I wish it was a bit more affordable, but the product truly works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a golfer and have never been a &amp;#34;suntanning goddess&amp;#34; so I need color mostly on my legs. This product definitely does the trick and adds a nice brown color; not orange-y at all, in just two applications!  Here&#x27;s a helpful hint:  since I only need it for my legs I cut off a third of the towelette and put the rest back in the pouch with a firm clip so it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  I found this works out nicely and I get two more applications from the same piece.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend got these as a gift at an Oscar party in Los Angeles.  She let me use one and since I&#x27;ve been hooked.  WELL worth the money!  You don&#x27;t turn orange and looks very natural.  BUT make sure you wear rubber gloves when putting this on - it does put an odd color on your hands if you don&#x27;t !</li>
    <li> Kate Somerville 360 Tanning Towelettes are the best self tanning product I have ever tried!  Very easy to use - just unfold the towelette and wipe on.  Non streaking and very pleasant smell - not like others I&#x27;ve tried before.  I have told everyone I know about this product - save yourself from spending extra money at the tanning salons - this product really works.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Streak free. No mess. Beautiful color.</li>
