      <li>This product is really great,smells wonderful all over the body,love the fragrance that stays with you....</li>
      <li>The smell is perfect for me, and the lotion is very silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and in good order</li>
      <li>I love this lotion, and the body wash, also.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>i LOVE IT ON HER..</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I am quite pleased with this body lotion.</li>
      <li>It is my girl friends favorite and mine.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance I have the body wash lotion and perfume.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this lotion!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it is ok...</li>
      <li>Smells so fresh!!</li>
      <li>diminish the sweet smell of Cashmere Glow by mixing it with Crabtree and Evelyn&#x27;s Goatmilk lotion, a lovely fresh-scented lotion</li>
      <li>Light feeling not oily feeling.</li>
      <li>Great price for the big size!</li>
      <li>It has a soft smell- feels good on skin.</li>
      <li>a rich, fresh-scented combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Never too strong and always fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>A very alluring and captivating fragrance.</li>
      <li>to get a better result and am happy to report that it&#x27;s been highly successful: At almost 70, my skin is not crepey or dry and does not exhibit any of the usual aging-skin</li>
      <li>I love the new BBW Cashmere Glow.</li>
      <li>The amount in the bottle is adequate and the packaging is pretty.</li>
      <li>I think the scent is just right in terms of sweetness/strength, not too overpowering or cloying.</li>
      <li>I got this as a gift about 3 years ago and liked it so much I order it regularly.</li>
      <li>.. love this product and it last forever!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aquaphor Healing Ointment mixed with Cashmere Glow Body lotion is another winning combination.</li>
      <li>the scent tends to fade away relatively fast!</li>
      <li>I have withheld the fifth star because the fragrance is just a tad on the sweet side but still is fresh, the latter of which I always prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>/&gt;Delivery is always fast &amp; ya can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
      <li>I use that on my lower back, especially, after showering to eliminate itching while adding a nice scent.</li>
      <li>Four stars from me for this rich lotion that actually softens my skin.</li>
      <li>: For added richness to your favorite body lotion, you might want to try mixing it with Aquaphor (which is unscented) or Cetaphil moisturizing cream (slightly scented); I prefer Aquaphor.</li>
      <li>I will enjoy it this winter when one&#x27;s skin gets so  dry.</li>
      <li>I received a small bottle for Christmas and immediately ordered a larger bottle because I liked it so well.</li>
      <li>The smell n satin soft it leaves your skin.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s not exactly what I thought &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; to smell like (based on a few cashmere perfumes I&#x27;ve sampled), but the brown sugar/ vanilla type smell it has to it is rather nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had the opportunity to smell this scent as apparently it&#x27;s discontinued, so I took a gamble on purchasing it online.</li>

<li> Non irritating.</li>
<li> Do not make the error in purchasing the triple moisture cream though, it&#x27;s really weird in its fragrance.</li>

    <li> Beautiful fragrance! Never too strong and always fresh smelling. I don&#x27;t have to drive 100 miles to a Bath and Body Works store.</li>
    <li> as described by the recipient</li>
    <li> Love it. Came quickly and in good order</li>
    <li> My roommate had this and immediately I smelt it from across the room and had to purchase it. She&#x27;s almost done with her second bottle! Smells so fresh!! With a kick of flintiness, all the guys on campus were friends with come in our room and can&#x27;t put that bottle of lotion down !! great for using after you shave and shower as well.. love this product and it last forever!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! The smell n satin soft it leaves your skin. Light feeling not oily feeling. One of the best</li>
    <li> Item was received as expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> It is my girl friends favorite and mine. Lites her eyes up when I give it to here.</li>
    <li> excellent aroma, happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, and the body wash, also. I use it in the place of perfume because it seems to last a long time on me. The smell is perfect for me, and the lotion is very silky and smooth. I got it for Christmas as a gift and am on my second bottle of lotion. I always run out of the body wash, but still have the lotion.</li>
    <li> I received a small bottle for Christmas and immediately ordered a larger bottle because I liked it so well. Even ordered the body spray.</li>
    <li> SHE LIKES IT.. i LOVE IT ON HER.. WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY. BATH AND BODY WORKS HAVE THE BEST LOTIONS.. PERIOD</li>
    <li> i bought the whole line based on another purchase which ahppened to be the wrong item... for what this is worth it is ok... the scent tends to fade away relatively fast!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance I have the body wash lotion and perfume.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion!&lt;br /&gt;I use the shower and the lotion and always get compliments on how good I smell</li>
    <li> Great price for the big size! Really happy with purchase!</li>

Although it&#x27;s not exactly what I thought &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; to smell like (based on a few cashmere perfumes I&#x27;ve sampled), but the brown sugar/ vanilla type smell it has to it is rather nice. It&#x27;s a perfect fall scent!</li>
    <li> I love the new BBW Cashmere Glow. It has a soft smell- feels good on skin. Non irritating. Arrived head of schedule.</li>
    <li> This product is really great,smells wonderful all over the body,love the fragrance that stays with you....</li>
    <li> Four stars from me for this rich lotion that actually softens my skin. I have withheld the fifth star because the fragrance is just a tad on the sweet side but still is fresh, the latter of which I always prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I diminish the sweet smell of Cashmere Glow by mixing it with Crabtree and Evelyn&#x27;s Goatmilk lotion, a lovely fresh-scented lotion that&#x27;s, unfortunately, not as rich as the Cashmere Glow lotion. Together the two make what I believe to be a rich, fresh-scented combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor Healing Ointment mixed with Cashmere Glow Body lotion is another winning combination. I use that on my lower back, especially, after showering to eliminate itching while adding a nice scent. I use it all over but concentrate on my lower back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to buy Cashmere Glow Body lotion because of its richness and how well it softens my skin...even without mixing it with something else (but, again, to eliminate ITCHING, mix it with Aquaphor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: For added richness to your favorite body lotion, you might want to try mixing it with Aquaphor (which is unscented) or Cetaphil moisturizing cream (slightly scented); I prefer Aquaphor. I&#x27;m always mixing lotions, haircare products, etc. to get a better result and am happy to report that it&#x27;s been highly successful: At almost 70, my skin is not crepey or dry and does not exhibit any of the usual aging-skin symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Buy the Cashmere Glow lotion.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift about 3 years ago and liked it so much I order it regularly. I love the scent.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this! I earned bonus points for getting it for her.&lt;br /&gt;If your wife loves lotion and loves this scent, you too can earn bonus points!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery is always fast &amp; ya can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I adore this fragrance in both body mist and lotion forms. A very alluring and captivating fragrance. Do not make the error in purchasing the triple moisture cream though, it&#x27;s really weird in its fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with this body lotion. I will enjoy it this winter when one&#x27;s skin gets so  dry. I think the scent is just right in terms of sweetness/strength, not too overpowering or cloying. The amount in the bottle is adequate and the packaging is pretty. I am very pleased with this product- I prefer the scent a lotion provides rather than a spray. It was nice to get a BBW product here at a good price.</li>
