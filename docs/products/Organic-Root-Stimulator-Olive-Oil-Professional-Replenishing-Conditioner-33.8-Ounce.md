      <li>and I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>this is one of my favorite conditioners...</li>
      <li>So I was willing to pay the $17/bottle for this conditioner, thinking it would be really moisturizing and perfect for her hair.  </li>
      <li>love this huge bottle.</li>
      <li>It has a thinner consistency than I thought - which might be fine for some.</li>

      <li>i will definitely be ordering more because this saves me from having to go to the store more often</li>
      <li>This deep conditioner is simply the best de tangling conditioner I have come across.</li>

      <li>This product is definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite deep conditioner, it smells amazing and my hair is so soft and manageable after its use.</li>
      <li>after searching high and low i realized my natural hair liked the same conditioner my relaxed hair liked!</li>
      <li>keep my hair soft and strong.</li>
      <li>Very fast.</li>

      <li>It leaves my hair \\&quot;slick\\&quot; and super soft.</li>
      <li>Product arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
      <li>fact that I got enough of it to last more than a year is icing on the cake.</li>

      <li>My hair is shinny and soft.  </li>
      <li>I really like the smell, but it did not work on my hair type as a deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>and it always leaves my hair soft and managable</li>
      <li>Every time I stray from this conditioner for a more expensive one, I end up coming right back.</li>
      <li>many hair care products on here, this is overpriced, but as of late I can&#x27;t find it anywhere!</li>
      <li>The reason I bought the big pack was because I had a great first use; but every use (as a DC) after that has left me disappointed.</li>
      <li>It has silicone in it for those following the curly girl method, but it leaves my hair so soft and manageable and makes shower detangling a dream.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s possibly too oily for White, Latino, Asian or somewhat straight Black/African hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

    <li> its the best deep conditioner ever, ,my hair love it, my hair is softer and stronger in just one use</li>
    <li> Thank you, Amazon for having this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many hair care products on here, this is overpriced, but as of late I can&#x27;t find it anywhere! (I usually get it at Sally Beauty Supply for around $11).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best deep conditioner ever! I&#x27;ve been using this for 10 years or so and it makes my hair happy. I just wash, apply liberally and throw a shower cap on for 30 minutes to overnight mm hmmm. So happy I found it on here. I hope Sally&#x27;s gets it back though lol.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes the hair feel like silk.  It&#x27;s possibly too oily for White, Latino, Asian or somewhat straight Black/African hair.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I got enough of it to last more than a year is icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. Part of my hair staple product that I use on my wash days. I have relaxed and transitioning hair and I love this stuff. has great slip. keep my hair soft and strong. I always buy this product. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair as well as Seborrheic Dermatitis which causes me to have to wash my hair at least 2x a week. I use this after every wash and it has done wonders with helping me keep moisture</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year I use it as a deep conditioner and it always leaves my hair soft and managable</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair feels after I&#x27;ve applied the organic root stimulator...this is one of my favorite conditioners...my hair was quite dry before...but now it feels as though the root stimulator has revived it...it feels and looks healthier...I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> A staple product for me. I&#x27;ve used it when I was relaxed and when natural and it worked like a charm each time!</li>
    <li> i recently cut off all my relaxer. went on a product binge to find new products for my natural hair. after searching high and low i realized my natural hair liked the same conditioner my relaxed hair liked!</li>
    <li> I have use the ORS single replenishing packs before to deep condition my hair. So I decided Amazon had this for a good price, I would buy the big bottle. My hair is pretty damaged so I plan on using this once a week and co-washing in between. I bought from Noonie&#x27;s and they were great. Very fast. Attentive and prompt emails from seller. Will purchase this product again and definitely re-purchase from Noonies if they&#x27;re still selling on here.</li>
    <li> This deep conditioner is simply the best de tangling conditioner I have come across. I am transitioning to natural hair from relaxed hair and I am challenged with 2 different textures. I have used conditioners from prestige brands and nothing comes close to the results I get from this. It leaves my hair \\&quot;slick\\&quot; and super soft. I can comb through my hair with my fingers while it&#x27;s wet, damp and dry. I usually place a plastic bag on my hair and sit under the dryer for 15-20 minutes and then rinse.</li>
    <li> This product works well. I would recommend it without reservation. It moisturizes well, leaves my hair feeling wonderful. Product arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> I love organic root stimulator replenishing conditioner! I get amazing slip from it (have been looking for a silicone free alternative and nothing compares). It has silicone in it for those following the curly girl method, but it leaves my hair so soft and manageable and makes shower detangling a dream.</li>
    <li> love this huge bottle. i will definitely be ordering more because this saves me from having to go to the store more often but I love it</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received the order. I thought I was getting The root stimulator as advertised, but instead received replenishing conditioner. These are two VERY different formulas. The root stimulator is VERY thick and only takes a very small amount to do the trick. What I received was regular conditioner. I bought 6 bottles @ 33.8 oz each. The shipping was rediculas  @ 22.12. So the shipping cost me what the conditioner did! This item is not root stimulator, but regular conditioner with a small amount of olive oil in it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE ORS! It&#x27;s the only conditioner that truly works! I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years along with the relaxer and a mix of other products but this conditiiner is the beat I&#x27;m so glad it comes in this size</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing, I have been using it for many years. Every time I stray from this conditioner for a more expensive one, I end up coming right back. There is nothing that moisturizes my natural hair better than this conditioner, and I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> I have no idea where I got my curly hair but it has been a struggle all of my life.  Just recently I learned that the reason it frizzes is because it is so dry.  I have tried many many products and non of them seemed to work.  I found the answer to my problem with this Olive Oil Root Stimulator.  I apply this Olive Oil and it moisturizes my hair for two weeks.  I continue to use a coconut oil cream rinse after each wash, even when I use the Olive Oil.  What a difference it has made.  My hair is shinny and soft.  It will still frizz some when I am outside and work to the point of sweating.  However, it is not as bad as it used to be.  This product is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> BEST CONDITIONER ON THE MARKET!!!!!  YOUR HAIR WILL BE LIKE BUTTER!!  WONDERFUL SCENT AND EXCELLENT FOR NATURAL HAIR.  NOT A STRAND OF HAIR IN MY COMB AFTER I CONDITION.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell, but it did not work on my hair type as a deep conditioner. There was no difference in my hair when I co-washed and when I deep conditioned (and I left it in my hair for an hour). It has a thinner consistency than I thought - which might be fine for some. The reason I bought the big pack was because I had a great first use; but every use (as a DC) after that has left me disappointed. I couldn&#x27;t throw out the whole bottle, so I decided to start using it for my co-wash and that has worked out better for me.</li>
    <li> I really loved the Olive Oil Shampoo for my daughters mixed hair, it seemed to bring the curls out so well.  So I was willing to pay the $17/bottle for this conditioner, thinking it would be really moisturizing and perfect for her hair.  I was so disappointed!  I had to use like three handfuls of conditioner and a lot of tugging and pulling to get the tangles out of her hair, plus her hair just didn&#x27;t seem to be moisturized.  I will be switching back to what I had used before, which is the Herbal Essence Hello Hydration conditioner unless I find something even better.  At $6/bottle it is far superior in quality as well as price. Only takes one handful of conditioner and detangles easily leaving her (and my) hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
