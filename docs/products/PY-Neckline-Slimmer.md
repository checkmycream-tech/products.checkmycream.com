      <li>It&#x27;s a good idea though.</li>

      <li>I love it, in 3 days ,my neck look great ,you can see the diferrence</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work!</li>
      <li>I have the great genetic gift of turkey neck, and got this to help smooth that area (and improve strength in my jaw too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I noticed there was a difference in my neck, and under my chin, although my neck became kind of ropey.</li>
      <li>It really is effective.  </li>
      <li>I have to be honest and tell you I didn&#x27;t think this was going to work.</li>
      <li>like that it comes with it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>Otherwise I think it would have been effective for me.</li>
      <li>liked the design, and started out at the lowest level spring.</li>
      <li>I suggest trying something like the yoga or some kind of exercise and see if that helps.</li>
      <li>THIS has become my new best friend.</li>
      <li>but it was actually very easy to do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>however, taken moderately, very strong exerciser.</li>
      <li>Works great, easy to use, easy to make time to do it.</li>
      <li>After four or five days, I increased the pressure needed to compress the device in order to get a more effective use each time.  </li>
      <li>It was worth the money and we are happy with the item and price of it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had a positive and good experience buying anything from Amazon and their vendors, The quailty of their products is good and shipping and delivery has always been as promised on time.</li>
      <li>Springs need more resistance to be able to work more effectively.</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made and didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for me.</li>
      <li>and you II love it</li>
      <li>Someone must have been colorblind :)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>better to exercise and eat better.</li>
      <li>I have bought probly 20 of them and gifted my kids and close friends...</li>
      <li>month.&lt;br /&gt;I would still love to try it.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t seem to be my miracle cure:)</li>
      <li>I feel that I look better.</li>
      <li>,, i returned to purchase two more for my friends.</li>
      <li>I love the neckline slimmer.  </li>
      <li>, my neck and jowl line looks better.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pleased that I feel that it&#x27;s getting to the muscles already.</li>
      <li>and that helped more than this item.</li>
      <li>But, for that price point, I will probably buy another and hope for better results.</li>
      <li>I got so many compliments when I went to visit friends.</li>
      <li>However, I wish to see more improvement so I will continue using it, this time, with more resistance and more repetitions in order to get better results.</li>
      <li>I believe the NS may have contributed to the disorder, though I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
      <li>Watch the video online to make sure you are using it correctly.</li>
      <li>but sure not for giving to somebody.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I love my neckline slimmer.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t pay a lot.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it was more about strengthening the muscles in hopes that it would help defend against my sleep apnea, and also add health to my thyroid gland.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>On some days I have done more reps when I felt like it.</li>
      <li>Bottom line is it actually did something, and with tempered expectations, I am impressed.</li>
      <li>I Love it.</li>
      <li>need to use more often</li>
      <li>But for this price its really pretty good.</li>
      <li>, I could see it was working, but we moved and I lost it in the move, so I am really happy to have a new one.  </li>
      <li>It works great and the price from this seller is amazing for same quality elsewhere.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s less bulky for storage,is even practical to bring with you if you travel a lot,  plus it fights nicely in my hand and fits perfectly between my chin and chest and is comfortable.</li>
      <li>You look goofy doing the exercises and it is just cheap.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, a wonderful product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it daily, as I probably should.  So I really can&#x27;t say much about this product.  It&#x27;s a good idea though.</li>
    <li> This works great I had to use the firmest spring the other two were not really giving my neckline a work out. If you do this consistently it will work.</li>
    <li> was broken when I got it and chucked it straight out. very open and squashed box should have listened to other reviews and not bought it. wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> I have to be honest and tell you I didn&#x27;t think this was going to work. It&#x27;s not expensive so, I gave it a try. It does work. You have to do it everyday. I would do it before I went to bed. I wasn&#x27;t sore or anything. I recommend that if you purchase it use the strongest coil. I think it&#x27;s purple. I got so many compliments when I went to visit friends. They kept asking me, \\&quot;have you lost weight? We can see it in your face.\\&quot; I knew good and well that I hadn&#x27;t lost any weight. LOL!!!!</li>
    <li> Silly purchase, tossed behind my printer after a 12 second effort. I&#x27;ve decided my chins are rather attractive as is.</li>
    <li> For years, I have struggled with my floppy turkey neck.  I have tried everything- keggles, neck yoga, rubber cement, even cosmetic tape.  Alas, my neck remained loose and saggy.  Then I saw this product on television, and my life changed.  I used it for only sixty minutes, three times a day for a year- and I started to see results.  They were small at that point, but I sure noticed them.  Several years later I have had people comment on my firm neck line, and increased definition in my neck muscles.  I went from looking sixty-six, to looking not a day over sixty-four.  Men in my retirement home constantly gawk at my neck, and I have experienced a rejuvenated love life.  Even the geriatric nurse boys give me the eye every now and then.  So if you want to look younger and more \\&quot;hip,\\&quot; then experience this product for yourself.</li>
    <li> need to use more often</li>
    <li> They sent me some cheap plastic toy with three springs and some weird direction papers.&lt;br /&gt;I tried out the directions but it just doesn&#x27;t feel right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy, and in my man&#x27;s point of view, this is a crappy product and I regret every dime I wasted on this product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly.  I opened and proceeded to put the first spring in the product.  Our 2 yr. old grandson was here and picked up the remaining two springs and left the room.  I went to see where he had gone and to retrieve my springs.  I hadn&#x27;t had the product 10 minutes yet.  I couldn&#x27;t find them.  When I showed him the remaining one and asked what he did with them, he went to the kitchen trash can and opened it.  My husband had already removed the full bag and all that was there was an empty bag.  So I had to go to the curb and sort through icky garbage, but I found them.  He was right, he had put them in the trash!!!!!  Now I take care of my springs!    So far I am very satisfied with the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> Trash broke first day of using it</li>
    <li> this little thing is really good&lt;br /&gt;fast and easy to throw into a daily routing in under 1 min&lt;br /&gt;i do 3 sets of 8, real fast and get it done&lt;br /&gt;nice bag to carry it&lt;br /&gt;3 springs to choose from&lt;br /&gt;a high-end gadget, makes a great gift!&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I like this product. It works out and tones your face. I know a lot of people buy it just for now until they can afford plastic surgery but I use it just to work out my jawline and lose some of my \\&quot;baby fat\\&quot; thats been annoying me for awhile. I recommend it for anyone who personally wants a slimmer face.</li>
    <li> I got the product in perfect timing and in good condition however the product its self just seems to be false advertisement. In fact, the more I used the product, the more back pains I was beginning to get. It seemed to affect my back and jaw far more than my double chin lol. With all that being said I&#x27;d say the product its self is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> For some reason it works I use it pretty much everyday I could see the difference I do look younger</li>
    <li> I like it so far.  Only time will say if it works  It is too soon to say anything yet</li>
    <li> I have been using the Neckline Slimmer for about a week since it was delivered.  After four or five days, I increased the pressure needed to compress the device in order to get a more effective use each time.  Definitely an improvement in the neck silhouette by a tightening of those muscles.</li>
    <li> This items work fine for me, I think that it may take long time to see results.The should make stronger springs available for anyone who wants to purchase then to use with the same item or make sets available to increase the resistance for people who can use more power to exercise according to their capacity that&#x27;s the reason I give four stars.</li>
    <li> I use it for about 6 months, 10-20 minutes everyday. nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother. better to exercise and eat better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little premature in my review, but my intent is to continue to update as I use the product. Immediately, after using the product for my first day I am feeling effects of using the product. This is encouraging and I am excited to see how things go. Just like you, I read the reviews and saw the Debbie downers, obviously, I could just do this myself with my own hand. But there&#x27;s just something about a consistent, controlled exercise that intrigued me about this product. I will update in 30 days from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update - 5/15/2014*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, some time has passed and I have failed in my 30-day obligation. For that I apologize. However, with that being said I am very happy with this product. Although I cannot cut glass with my jaw line, it has mad a noticeable improvement in my appearance. My wife has even noticed that it has slimmed up my *chineck*. For the price I paid it has become an invaluable product in my efforts to improve my cosmetic appearance and boost my confidence. What I have been doing for the past few months in terms of routine is using it every morning on the drive in to work. 10 min or less each morning, then another session on the way home. I wish I could say I have been 100% consistent, but nevertheless, I did it \\&quot;almost\\&quot; everyday. One tiny tidbit that I noticed within the first month of use, I had slight headaches which I attributed to using the product. It was a very small annoyance but stopped after I built a solid routine. It wasn&#x27;t enough to take meds, I compare it to pains normally gained from working out any other part of your body. Bottom line is it actually did something, and with tempered expectations, I am impressed. Give it a try (especially at this price point) and you shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I feel my neck muscles burn after using about 2 min. I slightly turn my head to the left and then to the right to work side muscles as well. I love it. Started seeing a difference after 2 weeks 3 to 4 min a day.</li>
    <li> didnt do what it claim</li>
    <li> If you use it everyday 2x a day it does really work.</li>
    <li> With constant use I noticed no difference and it hurt the back of my neck.</li>
    <li> We can&#x27;t even get this device to open, so we can&#x27;t assemble it and therefore have no idea if it works or not.</li>
    <li> My aunt got one of these and I must admit the rest of us were suspicious.  She has actually been seeing improvement!  Basically you just hold the apparatus under your chin and push the plunger down with your chin.  You start with the weakest spring and move up in resistance.  Neck muscles are really hard to tone (aka tightening skin on the neck as well).  Great for if you want to tone that area or need to nod vigorously.</li>
    <li> This was a total waste of my money.  I only purchased it because of the cost and I thought I would get it a try.  Sorry I wasted my money. Should had bought a Subway sandwich.</li>
    <li> I have not seen results as yet. So, i do not wish to rate the product as yet.  Will definite report.</li>
    <li> This puppy does work.  I&#x27;ve noticed my  neck firming up after using it for about a month, off and on.  Am sure I&#x27;ll have better results once I get a routine down and stick to it.</li>
    <li> I love the neckline slimmer.  It really works and I will contnue to use it until I can afford a face lift!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t figured this one out yet. It&#x27;s a little hard for me to use. It could be that my spring is too tight.</li>
    <li> I have only used this Slimmer for a week and already my neck feels better.  I don&#x27;t see where I have lost any of my double chin, but I hope that will come with time.</li>
    <li> I used the Neckline Slimmer over a period of at least a year, and perhaps longer. I noticed there was a difference in my neck, and under my chin, although my neck became kind of ropey. I used the highest setting eventually, but noticed pain in my jaw and so stopped. Later, on I did develop a TMJ disorder- pain and clicking, popping sounds in the jawline area. I believe the NS may have contributed to the disorder, though I can&#x27;t be sure. I think use with caution. I believe the NS put a lot of extra pressure on those muscles in that area.&lt;br /&gt;There are other exercises to improve your neck and jawline area without putting too much stress on it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Easy to use and it does help firm up the neck area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31. I gained some weight in the past few months and it really shows up in my face. I had a double chin, and I wasn&#x27;t a fan of that look. So I ordered this, and felt embarrassed. It&#x27;s just a gizmo, right? Wrong. I noticed a difference within a week. Now people comment on how I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;lost weight&amp;#34; when I really haven&#x27;t. I notice my jawline MUCH more, and my double chin has gone away with the wind.&lt;br /&gt;I use it, as directed, 30 reps of each exercise per day, held for 2 seconds each. On some days I have done more reps when I felt like it. I can really feel this working, especially in my jaw muscles. I use the highest resistance spring.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are: that it is squeaky like a bad mattress, and sometimes won&#x27;t lock in the all the way down position, but these are minor complaints, and don&#x27;t affect the function of the device.&lt;br /&gt;The bag it comes with is handy, and fits the device well.&lt;br /&gt;If it wears out I will buy another, and another, and another, until I die. That&#x27;s how much I believe in it.</li>
    <li> Have used before and it works..Got this one for a friend.  It really is effective.  Don&#x27;t over do the exercises at first.</li>
    <li> This thing is broken when I receive it. So I just put it away. quality and material are  very poor!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This little baby will definitely give the muscles in your neck a total workout.  I am too busy to use it a lot, but whenever I do use it, I know my neck has been &#x27;put through its paces&#x27;--and so will you!  There is no doubt that exercising the neck area would be of more benefit than mere dieting. It&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> I have the great genetic gift of turkey neck, and got this to help smooth that area (and improve strength in my jaw too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the design, and started out at the lowest level spring. It was pretty easy to use. I can&#x27;t say I noticed a big difference right away, but I was in it for the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it broke with routine use after about 3 weeks--the pad where your chin goes snapped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that said, for about $5 it was a pretty cheap investment and you pay for what you get. But, for that price point, I will probably buy another and hope for better results.</li>
    <li> I saw the advertisement on TV and decided that I would try this item.  It took longer to be delivered, which surprised me, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
    <li> It never arrived. It&#x27;s been nearly a month and I never got so much as even an email notification as to where or what happened to it. I wasted money for nothing, literally.</li>
    <li> Nice product if you are avoiding chemical and want a more natural approach.  I felt there was some improvement, but not a lot.  Easy to use while reading or watching tv.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a great device but it is fun and interesting. If you want your head/neck to feel like it gets a workout then use this and the tightest spring. This can do wonders but it isn&#x27;t just this that will do it for you.</li>
    <li> It works!,, i returned to purchase two more for my friends. But you really have to follow thru and do it</li>
    <li> I have been using it pretty regularly and I do notice some improvement. I feel that I look better. I &#x27;m going to keep at it.</li>
    <li> I used it a few times , it was ok but the next day i would feel light headed .</li>
    <li> I have not even opened it.....I would like to return .  When it arrived...I looked at it and thought it was the stupidest thing I ever saw. Can you tell me how to return (via my email...which you should have</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this works! I haven&#x27;t seen no difference. Great price for testing it out though.</li>
    <li> Knew for the price that it wouldn&#x27;t be much. But this is so cheaply made it&#x27;s ghastly.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  You look goofy doing the exercises and it is just cheap.  Hard to stick to using it everyday or to think that it will really do anything other than making you look silly :)</li>
    <li> This is a simple little gadget. As long as you use it as directed and consistently, you should see some results. I know I have.</li>
    <li> Hopefully, over time it will provide me with the results I&#x27;m looking for. I think that it takes a lot of dedication.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty low quality device and a bit silly, in my opinion.  I do not think there is any real exercise occurring from using this device, but perhaps if used for extensive periods of time, there would be.  I gave it three stars because it did fulfill my expectations, which were very low. As to the product itself, I will say that the device comes with multiple springs for different tensions, but even the firmest one does not provide enough pressure to feel effective.</li>
    <li> This equipment is a very good exercise for the sag under the jaw.  I actually observe some results within 2 weeks of using the neckline slimmer even though I did not use it everyday.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Got a pair of these but haven&#x27;t used them regularly. When I go to the gym, I try to exercise under my chin.  Combined with this simple machine, the results should be better.</li>
    <li> I tried it for 6 straight weeks and took weekly profile pictures and absolutely no change.  I was disappointed and wasted $.</li>
    <li> This would not open for you to put the tension springs in....so  I asked them to send a new one and that one won&#x27;t open either!!  Threw them both in the trash!</li>
    <li> I bought TWO because my first one broke, and then the second one broke as well. They don&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love my neckline slimmer. It is so easy to stick to the exercise routine.  It is on my nightstand and every morning and night I do the neck exercise.  I think I am now addicted to it.</li>
    <li> I saw no starting results after 2 wks.  It may work for others but there must be a long time frame involved.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this lousy item - It doesn&#x27;t work - made out of cheap material that will not even last for a week ---</li>
    <li> I ordered this neckline slimmer on December 25, 2012. For awhile I did use it constantly for about a month. After developing jaw pain, I have to stop using it. I did feel pain on my jaw even talking. I don&#x27;t recommend people to purchase this product. I don&#x27;t have a big issue of double chin. But I do have a small double chin.&lt;br /&gt;Glad this product only cost about 5 bucks; otherwise it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not real impressed, but I&#x27;ll keep working on it.  I just need something to exercise that stubborn neck area.  This product doesn&#x27;t seem to be my miracle cure:)</li>
    <li> Will work if you will</li>
    <li> I never thought i would get one used and broken. Whatever money I spent was a waste. Couldn&#x27;t even put the pieces together</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily for the last two weeks and just graduated to the strongest spring. That tells me that it is strengthening some muscles. I got it for two reasons. A recent cervical spinal fusion and wanting a visibly tighter jaw and neck area. The judgement is still out on the total success, but I will keep working on it.</li>
    <li> Just very awkward to use,seems very gimmicky to me!!</li>
    <li> Simple to use and it helps strengthen the neckline.</li>
    <li> It never worked and I asked for a replacement which has not come even though it has been at least a month.&lt;br /&gt;I would still love to try it.</li>
    <li> Just when I had given up it arrived from Asia and came by mail which I did not realize when I bought it.  I have no idea if it will yield good results but I will give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is a very a very flimsy plastic device that does absolutely nothing but make you look foolish for spending your money on such a ridiculous product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times only but I&#x27;m still not sure as to how to use it properly even though it came with instructions. I guess you just have to be consistent with it and it only takes like 5 minutes of your time to use this product each day. There&#x27;s no good or bad review to this product. I&#x27;m just neutral.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to think of this contraption. It does seem to make the muscles burn when using it so it does the job of toning the neck and jaw line muscles but my jaw joints pop and crack alot when using it. So yes I suppose it does work in theory and practice, but even on the lowest spring tension, if you have TMJ or other joint disorder it may cause some irritation so prepare to be sore after use.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money even though it didn&#x27;t cost that much, don&#x27;t buy it, it does not work, I threw it in the garbage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very into facial exercises and this thing works great I could feel after the first day at a tightening attending in my face I am 52 years old and this going to help me look a lot younger at least 10 years your muscles in your face can be tightened just like the muscles of your body so great product I&#x27;m a certified massage therapist and I plan on letting folks know about this in my business.</li>
    <li> My order came with only two sizes of springs. Received three springs, two&lt;br /&gt; are the same. If I would remember do use it I&#x27;m sure it would work!</li>
    <li> Since I have gotten older I have started noticing my chin and neck area sagging. As long as I use this at least once a day it stays firmer, but when I don&#x27;t use it the sag comes right back so the product works as long as you use it. This is also much cheaper here than at Wal-Greens which is the only other place I have seen it.</li>
    <li> Not enough resistance.  Springs need more resistance to be able to work more effectively. The pros are that it at least gets you exercising those neglected muscles.</li>
    <li> Received approximately 5 days ago.  Have not been able to open to insert springs.  Afraid to turn or pull too hard as not the best made item and instructions are negligible.  So, don&#x27;t know how it works!</li>
    <li> I would have very bad neck pain that caused headaches for years.  Went for acupuncture which helped but at $100.00 a session, well that did not last long.  Also did physical therapy but that was useless for me. I found that stretching exercises made matters  worse.  Bought this for another reason (to tone neck muscle) and found it works the back of the neck also and at first it hurt but VERY quickly my headaches and neck pain vanished.  This was a miracle products for me.  Hope it does the same if you have this issue.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have time to use it yet but have tried it and seams good. Everything is as described. Looks a good purchase the only thing now is to start using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and used it on a daily basis.  I saw subtle changes after weeks, but not any great miracle.</li>
    <li> Is important to work on the neck muscles like any other kind of muscle exercise which is so good for neck muscles also!</li>
    <li> This was junk and I waited over a month to receive.  I wanted to return but was not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> When it came I threw it in the trash.  I should have read the reviews BEFORE my purchase instead of AFTER.  My mistake.&lt;br /&gt;This device could seriously hurt your neck and give you long term problems.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference, also my plastic surgeon told me I should not do this, it will make my wrinkles worse</li>
    <li> Please do not waste your money on this devise . I bought it on E-bay cheap and thought it might help my sagging neck. I&#x27;m 54 and really want to change the appearance of my neck. anyway I started out using it on the spring they say to use so you don&#x27;t have too much tension at first. After a couple of weeks I went up to the next size and that created a little more tension in the devise and I had hopes ,no results after two weeks. Then, I used the third and last spring for 4 months to be sure I used it long enough to see some kind of result. There was never any result that was noticeable to the naked eye . I was really disappoint and down about it. I think it&#x27;s awful that they get people&#x27;s hopes up with gadgets they say work. Don&#x27;t fall for it. I thought it would work because you exercise the muscles and that would tighten the skin . So, I&#x27;m trying the book \\&quot;Face Yoga\\&quot;, it&#x27;s yoga exercises for the facial muscles . I got the book from the library and if it works I&#x27;ll buy it . I suggest trying something like the yoga or some kind of exercise and see if that helps. Just don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Still using this - because it works.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I see results. Been using it for almost 2mo. But I&#x27;m not giving up. Still have hope!</li>
    <li> Love it. I do not have to bend my head just open my mouth. So easy to use and you II love it</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend this product but not through this company. This seemed like a crude copy product. not same package as picture showing in this page and product itself is poorly crafted.&lt;br /&gt;I have same product that I love. It works great  and very good quality. I use all the time and my face and neck looks way tightened. So I wanted to give my friend this for trial. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t remember where I ordered my first one but I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t pay a lot.&lt;br /&gt;By the way this shippment was very cheesy and especially the rubber part ( that directly touches skin ) is irritating and made of low quality material.  Well ..it&#x27;s 4dollars....it can be bearable ....but sure not for giving to somebody.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll keep this for me and give mine to my friend. I&#x27;ll cover rubber parts with clothes while using it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I would not order if knew this was not original product.  I rather pay more and get the original product next time.</li>
    <li> My neck is too sore to even try this and I was silly to even try.  I am saving it for my daughter when she comes down in December.  Maybe she can use it.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Great product! Shipped on time</li>
    <li> Helps posture in upper back and head is held in more upright position.  Takes about 2 weeks to grow the new muscles to support the new comfortable and desirable posture.  However, used the DMAE (topical) to get neck less saggy.</li>
    <li> Ordered this as a replacement for one I&#x27;ve had for 4 years that broke. I love this product and believe it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to! My one complaint is each time I get a new one, I have to WD-40 the springs so they don&#x27;t squeak. Other than that, a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> First let me say that I have been using this product in conjunction with some other neck and face exercises for a couple of weeks. It does appear to be helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only gave it 2 stars is because I didn&#x27;t receive the one pictured and described, which was a big disappointment. The one I received doesn&#x27;t have the interchangeable springs and the different springs is the reason I chose this model. I blame the vendor for being misleading. It only has 1 spring that you adjust. I started at the highest tension and now have no way to move up. Bummer. I hate it when you purchase one thing and then get something different!</li>
    <li> Item is not well made. You can tell mass production of this item used a cheap plastic and method of throwing it together. However, if you are careful put the item together using one of the 3 springs (adjust tension) and tone your neck with exercises shown in a diagram. I felt the affects of the exercise the following day, but have yet to see results. The item is not built for long lasting, but it should work long enough to provide a benefit and maybe give you desired result. One consideration I wonder if can get results without the gadget, but by doing the exercises and using my fist for resistance.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got this so cheap and it works!  I am sure I look silly doing these exercises, but my face and neck are much much more tone!</li>
    <li> This slimmer replaces a previous PY NECKLINE SLIMMER I had for many years. I really do like it and it really does work.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use, easy to make time to do it.</li>
    <li> Not sure what&#x27;s going on with this thing. It&#x27;s not made well at all , very breakable and not sure about it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
    <li> it works in just days...i felt it working the first time i used it and i am positive it will firm my chin</li>
    <li> It works great. I have no problems with it.  We hav only used one of the springs, but hopely they will all work good.</li>
    <li> Using it is quite simple.  I find that I can leave it on my desktop and easily pick it up anytime I feel like it.  I can honestly say that it has not yet made a big difference in the old saggy neck.  But, I have only had it a short time and, unfortunately, I am not a super disciplined kind of guy who uses it religiously every day.  But, like any muscle related condition, the old maxim of use it or lose it applies here.  It has to tone the muscles if used consistently.  All-in-all I believe it is a well-designed muscle toner and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I took a chance, tho&#x27;s not an expensive one, and bought this thinking the idea behind it was sound.  I was so correct, my jawline has improved significantly since I started using this 6 months ago.  It works</li>
    <li> I recieved this order in a timley, manner. I did not expect to recieved the case, with it so it was an added bonus.  I had one before, and loved it, I could see it was working, but we moved and I lost it in the move, so I am really happy to have a new one.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Instruction are confusing.</li>
    <li> This has been working perfectly. I started to see results within the first week or two, and it was exactly what I expected. Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> To be clear, Amazon is my favorite place to shop, in part because in the rare times I have had trouble with a product, it is easy to resolve.  Well that depends on the manufacturer having integrity.  This one does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used their product twice, attempted to change the spring as instructed, and the device is permanently stuck.  The manufacturer&#x27;s response to me was, &amp;#34;To be frank with you, we don&#x27;t know what happened when you used it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not trust them with a dime of your money.  Find a different manufacturer if you want this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product not really sure what to expect. But after using it even just the first time I could notice results already! I definitely recommend this to anyone with that pesky double chin.</li>
    <li> Hoping to see results in a couple of months. Watch the video online to make sure you are using it correctly.</li>
    <li> There are conflicting reviews so I debated for a while before buying this.  To my surprise, it is constructed very well and I expect it will last a while.  It is a bargain for the price.  It makes little noise.  It works well.  I have used it 3 days so don&#x27;t see a change but I expect I will as it makes sense.  I used the weakest spring the first time and went to medium after that with no problems.  It has a decent pad so there&#x27;s zero pain either under my chin or on my sternum.  If I don&#x27;t see any difference in a few weeks, I&#x27;ll repost and rate it lower.</li>
    <li> I Love it. It&#x27;s Easy to use and I can already feel the difference!  Plus it&#x27;s convenient to carry and travel with.</li>
    <li> At first I thought the lowest-level spring would be too weak, but then I realized how strong the middle one was.  Definitely work your way up with this to avoid any strain on your neck and jaw.  Use it consistently and you will notice the difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using regularly as my neck&#x27;s fused from 4-7th vertebrates, and hope this inexpensive product will strengthen my muscles. Seems to work and it&#x27;s inexpensive, too!</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made and didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for me.</li>
    <li> I find this has really helped tone my once terrible and embarrassing fat neck and flab under my chin.  It got delivered way faster than they predicted and I&#x27;m very pleased with this company and the product.</li>
    <li> Received it today!  Looks good and I am  trying it tonight!</li>
    <li> Its a nifty little exerciser and seems to be helping with my double chin.  But it does bind up on itself sometimes and doesn&#x27;t always operate smoothly.  But for this price its really pretty good.</li>
    <li> I received this on Monday.  It is now Thursday, and the thing already broke! I have no idea if the product works because I did not get a chance to find out.  I understand that you get what you pay for, but it is pretty ridiculous that it couldn&#x27;t even last a week!  I would highly recommend paying a little more for a different product.</li>
    <li> im 64 and can use all the help i can get .it seems to help its not a miracle but i think with daily use it will make a difference.i received it very quickly</li>
    <li> I have been using the neck slimmer for 3 years...I have no extra skin under my chin at this time and I am 75.  I purchase them for gifts for my friends.</li>
    <li> Noticed results in 3 days.  I could see the muscles tightening up.  The first 2 days I stayed on lightest spring, then I got the medium spring.  I followed the directions exactly.  This little gadget has motivated me to lose weight.  If you are expecting miracles that&#x27;s not going to happen but if you expect results that are realistic you&#x27;ll be pleased.  Sorry kids but nothing can turn back the hands of time.  I like the way I look in the mirror now, my neck and jowl line looks better.</li>
    <li> It came broken.  I would like a new one.  Is that possible? Can you please tell me if I can do that.  Thank. You. JULIE PEDDY</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of them. One to  use in the car while I have to wait for a reason and one to have at home, and it helps your face conture to keep in good shape and young.</li>
    <li> So far so good....no results yet but it&#x27;s only day two, we shall see further down the road. If your wondering if it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use, it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> I have only just received your product but I&#x27;m pleased that I feel that it&#x27;s getting to the muscles already. I don&#x27;t have a lot to firm up but hope to see a clear difference, &amp; I like what I&#x27;m feeling.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be easier to use than it is...It sticks a little bit when pushing it down, so I find myself not using it...My cousin had great results with her&#x27;s and so I need to get motivated to use it.</li>
    <li> I am unable to get the top off. It also did not have the neckline cream in the packet. Poor product representation.</li>
    <li> It does have some effect when I use the strongest spring. Get the one with PY and not the cheap Chinese version. They are very squeeky.</li>
    <li> Gave me jaw problems within a week of using it.  My teeth hurt, too.  Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, already noticing a tightness in my neck area, after only a few weeks of using it</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE ITEM!!  WHAT A JOKE!  Seriously, I followed the instructions precisely and NO RESULTS at all!  No idea how any positive reviews were posted.  I am 120 pounds, 5&#x27;6, and just needed a little lift...NOTHING.</li>
    <li> It works great, not seeing showing results yet, but I know it will show after a while of using it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even tell if this works or not because the item was defective. It&#x27;s made vey cheaply and I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see much difference in the few months I&#x27;ve used it.  I have to wonder if lying on one&#x27;s bed with head over the edge and lifting and lowering head would do as much or maybe more.</li>
    <li> I received mine from hong kong and it was used. It even had mold on the inside..the outside was also disgusting like someone used it and packed it up like it was new and its broken...what a shame....i thought this was supposed yo be BRAND SPANKING NEW... never buy again</li>
    <li> I love it, in 3 days ,my neck look great ,you can see the diferrence,increible, I do 2 seccion of the exersise ,1 in the morning and 1 at night, and the resuls shows.</li>
    <li> It really works. I use neck exercisers for 15 years, this particular one probably for seven or eight years.&lt;br /&gt;At 55 I don&#x27;t have double chin, Much cheaper and safer than surgery.</li>
    <li> First, I will say that the product is very cheaply made and you must use care when inserting the springs to avoid breakage. The first week of use, I though I must be gaining a benefit as my neck was a bit sore. By week 2 the soreness was gone. By week 3 I started to notice some new neck sag, and by week 4 decided that it simply wasn&#x27;t providing the expected benefits. I felt that using the product was actually hurting not helping improve my neckline.  I actually believe chewing gum for 30 minutes a day likely tones more facial, chin and neck muscles that the Neckline Slimmer. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Used for months saw no results! Should have known than to buy a &amp;#34;seen on TV&amp;#34; product</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few years ago abd recently started using it. You can feel the new muscles being worked which is proof that it is doing what&#x27;s expected. The instructions say the spring colors are&lt;br /&gt;Low:Pink&lt;br /&gt;Medium:Green&lt;br /&gt;High:Purple&lt;br /&gt;Yet my spring colors are red, green and blue lol. Someone must have been colorblind :)&lt;br /&gt;Still a great product for the price</li>
    <li> The neckline slimmer was just what I expect to receive. It is very useful and easy to use, you can see the result in a short period of time. I can recommend it!</li>
    <li> this item didnt really help at all i started doing sit ups and that helped more than this item. It seems like a great idea but the actual result rate of the product is low</li>
    <li> Great!  Everyone should get this product if they want to improve neckline.  I can really feel it working.</li>
    <li> This is a well working ite. It was worth the money and we are happy with the item and price of it.</li>
    <li> some times i think its working but it helps if you ar doing it in addition to facial exercises and facial massage as well as dieting. other wise i havent seen much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time holding it in place. So far I don&#x27;t notice a difference but will continue using it as it will probably take a whie.</li>
    <li> Turns out that it aggravates my TMJ. Otherwise I think it would have been effective for me. Not expensive, but a little tricky to put together.</li>
    <li> definitely noticeable difference in my neck muscles.  i don&#x27;t know that i can see it but i can definitely feel it.  sounds crazy, but i think that if someone were to follow the directions and take it easy, that person may find their neck area growing stronger?  its not just appearance that was important to me, it was more about strengthening the muscles in hopes that it would help defend against my sleep apnea, and also add health to my thyroid gland.  the only reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the machine could use a little lube.  however, taken moderately, very strong exerciser.</li>
    <li> This really works...I learned that a year ago. I liked what this neckline slimmer did for my neck and profile so much, that I purchased this one for my 50 year old daughter, for Christmas! Great invention, at a wonderful anyone can afford price! Easy to use, easy to travel with, Use it everyday to stay young looking!  If used right...it helps the skin on your neck tighten too, as well as get rid of your double chin. At age 72, I look years younger, and would not want to be without it. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This definitely does the job. You have to use it and be consistent with it. After the first week or so there were results.</li>
    <li> I have to say it does work. It is cheap and yet it works. When I am bored and watching TV at night I will use it. You can feel it and it is nice to loose a little bit of that double chin. I mean come on. I recommend it for my lazy people out there like me.</li>
    <li> Just a silly gadget.  Does nothing for flabby jowls or chin.  One could facial exercises and get the same results.</li>
    <li> THIS has become my new best friend. It works great and the price from this seller is amazing for same quality elsewhere. It works you feel it working and stick with a routine or use it daily. it is quick easy to use and compact it is something you can stick in a purse even. Love it.</li>
    <li> Lame, but great white elephant gift.  Just hope you don&#x27;t offend the wrong person!!  Sorry mom!! Told you not to pick that bag, haha!</li>
    <li> Worthless piece of crap (to put it nicely).</li>
    <li> Anyone looking to slim and firm their neck and chin line will love this product.  I have been using it for three weeks now and I&#x27;m already seeing positive results.  I use it twice a day, once in the morning and evening.  I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with it so far.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this too long to really see results although it does feel like exercise.  Difficult to rate something I haven&#x27;t used that long.</li>
    <li> Its to hard, doesn&#x27;t stay in place. I thought it was something else. Its not wat I wanted. And I&#x27;ve been using since I order and I haven&#x27;t seen a change yet. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Had my doubts, but this really works.  You have to be diligent about using it, but used correctly it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really notice results</li>
    <li> When i bought this itrm i eas skepital that this eould do anything  for my sagging nevk. But  aftet using it now for 3 wrrks, i have had to change my first impression. What a great change to my neck. What a big difference. It is so remarkable. I will give another update aftet the 2nd month. But this is a great buy .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m bad at putting things together lol so I was concerned putting the various springs in it but it was actually very easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;My first time using it and continuing now daily I went right to the most resistant, strongest spring. I don&#x27;t use the two lesser springs.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it comes with it&#x27;s own little carrying purse w/ zipper too for storage.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s slightly smaller than I imagined it would be so it&#x27;s less bulky for storage,is even practical to bring with you if you travel a lot,  plus it fights nicely in my hand and fits perfectly between my chin and chest and is comfortable. It comes with instructions and suggestions for the exercises and how many to do for best results too. I plan to continue using this daily ongoing.</li>
    <li> I like the neckline slimmer. The result you achieve really depends on how consitent you are in using it, The neckline slimmer is simple and easy to use, but like any other exercise it takes time to achieve your goal. I would recommend this to anyone, its very affordable in price and worth trying. I&#x27;ve always had a positive and good experience buying anything from Amazon and their vendors, The quailty of their products is good and shipping and delivery has always been as promised on time. I use the neckline slimmer several times a day when I&#x27;m watching TV.</li>
    <li> Is doesn&#x27;t glide very well. Iam not impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> Many times, I&#x27;ve actually held this item in my hands at CVS pharmacy where they carry many \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; items but was so skeptical even though I wanted to purchase something that will help my now forming double chin, guess it&#x27;s due to age, oh well.  Anyway, before purchasing this item, I did some research and came across many positive reviews and that&#x27;s why I bought it here, at Amazon.com, this vendor has it at a very low price compared to others selling the exact item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the resistance is very good, I can feel it working. I even had my husband try it and he agreed with me and now wants to purchase one. I&#x27;ve had this item for only 2 days so it&#x27;s really too early to give a full review on this product but will be back guess after a month or so. Hopefully I will have good news in the future &#x27;cause I&#x27;m trying to avoid having some time of surgery to fix my double chin problem, wish me luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Aug. 11, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neckline Slimmer seems to be working gradually. Family and friends have noticed my neck and jaw line a little slimmer than it was before. However, I wish to see more improvement so I will continue using it, this time, with more resistance and more repetitions in order to get better results. I will be back with a final review of this product, hopefully I more progress.</li>
    <li> I bought this product like a moron thinking it would actually do something.  It does not.  If you want to lose that unsightly double chin, try chewing gum or simply losing weight.</li>
    <li> I use this as I am in my car, especially at red lights. It is amazing how fast it gets rid of &amp;#34;Neck Gobbel&amp;#34;...I have bought probly 20 of them and gifted my kids and close friends...your neck is like any other muscle, boy can it be toned up. I use the strongest spring.</li>
    <li> I have a very wobbly chin always effected myself esteam so I decided to try this product. I have been using it for 4 days now still no change but my chin muscles feels sore somewhat and I feel them toned a little bit, I relay hope this will work because I want to see my neckline defined at least once in my life&lt;br /&gt;Will come to you with updates soon</li>
    <li> received this on time and in perfect condition. I have not had much success with it so far but I have only made it to the second spring so far, hopefully the third one will give more results.</li>
