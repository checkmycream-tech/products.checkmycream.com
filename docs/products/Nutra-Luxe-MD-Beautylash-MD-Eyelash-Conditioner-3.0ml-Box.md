      <li>Citilash works much better.  </li>
      <li>Sure, but in the case of Nutra Luxe within 8 weeks</li>
      <li>does not look like an authentic product...</li>
      <li>so you do not get a counterfeit bottle like many people have.</li>
      <li>Make sure you buy from Nutra Luxe</li>
      <li>I used it every night and saw some results within two weeks and more noticeable results in a month.</li>
      <li>but these made my eyes stand out even more.</li>
      <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t put a lot on your eyelash line.</li>
      <li>and they all love it too.</li>
      <li>All three love it.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I purchased 3 more tubes as Christmas gifts for my daughters and a neighbor.  </li>
      <li>Since then I have been putting it on once every night and just love my lashes.</li>
      <li>You will see a difference in 3-4 weeks for sure.</li>
      <li>THAT COST MORE THAN THE PRODUCT,  </li>
      <li>Great product, fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>The result was so good, not even worth mentioning..</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I use it three times a week now, and my lashes look beautiful and so natural.</li>
      <li>I have seen a significant increase in my eyelashes and my eyebrows!  </li>
      <li>It really does a good job of growing the lashes.</li>
      <li>: make sure you get the original bottle with the MD on it.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply (like a liquid eye liner) every evening</li>
      <li>Her lashes grew so long, it is stunning and beautiful.</li>
      <li>It easy to use and no side affects for me.  </li>
      <li>, well, they were beautiful, but a couple weeks later, they fell off.  </li>
      <li>I tried Rapidlash first, and it didn&#x27;t work for me, although most people seem to like it better than Beautylash.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t risk trying this before an important event.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m kind of freaked out by people who say their husbands, friends and co-workers all noticed and spontaneously commented on their amazingly long lashes!)</li>
      <li>Although I have not used Beautylash as consistently as I used Rapidlash (every night), I have had better results.  </li>
      <li>and when you do wear mascara that&#x27;s where you noticed your lashes grew most because it changes the look of your eyes so much.  </li>
      <li>I would say it took about 3 months to reach the full results.  </li>
      <li>It is true that it takes 4 to 6 weeks</li>
      <li>I had heard such good things about this product from my optometrist.  </li>
      <li>The only good thing about the product was that 1 bottle lasted almost a year.</li>
      <li>Only good news is that with mascara</li>
      <li>On the first 3 nights I felt very mild tingling that lasted 30 seconds and nothing since then.  </li>
      <li>I should have have known I&#x27;d never be that lucky.</li>
      <li>My lashes grew tremendously</li>
      <li>The first one was cheap from the drug store and it didn&#x27;t bother my eyes, but didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  </li>
      <li>By the end of the first day, my eyes were so swollen and sore!  </li>
      <li>It really works!!</li>
      <li>With fast shipping makes it available faster...</li>
      <li>Overall, this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>start from where your own lashes start and a couple of mm short on both sides of each eye.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth reading.</li>
      <li>This product was received quickly and was exactly as advertised.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. I noticed a definite lengthening of my lashes. Lately I&#x27;ve forgotten to use it every night but I noticed a difference within about two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product from Drugstore.com for 2years. But couldn&#x27;t afford it. I decide to see if Amazon.com had it cheaper. I saw it on Your Zone. When I received it, and opened it I noticed that the liquid inside had a perfume smell to it. I compared it to the one I have from Drugstore.com and it is not the same product. I decided to tested it on my hand and it burned. The one that I ordered form Your Zone is fake.I e-mailed Your Zone 3 times for a refund and they never responded. I will be going back to Drugstore.com.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product if used correctly. Make sure you don&#x27;t put a lot on your eyelash line. It should not \\&quot;run\\&quot; into your eye. Putting more doesn&#x27;t mean it will work better or faster. start from where your own lashes start and a couple of mm short on both sides of each eye.  You will see a difference in 3-4 weeks for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16 years old, and I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to mascara. I didn&#x27;t want to spend 100+ dollars on an eyelash enhancer, and Nutra Luxe MD seemed the best. When I read the directions I was a little bit disappointed by it saying that it is not to be used under the age of 18. Regardless, I spent the money and wanted to try it out.  Pros:   - VERY easy to apply   - Not messy at all   - See results in a couple of days or weeks   - Quick, simple   - Longer/thicker eyelashes (I think I grew a few more!)   - If you skip a night or two, it won&#x27;t diminish the results  Cons:   - Try not to get it in your eye, it stings a little (but it&#x27;s not harmful)   - Not so effective on eyebrows  Overall, this product is amazing. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars just simply because of the eyebrow part. This might be because sometimes the area gets waxed.</li>
    <li> My friend has been using this product with results. Her lashes grew so long, it is stunning and beautiful. I immediately ordered this product and now 4 weeks later, I see results already. My lashes grew and were noticeable longer.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue with purchasing this product. It really works!!</li>
    <li> This stuff has so much salt in it that it makes my face have spots in the morning and no it doesn&#x27;t work at all people are not tell the truth about these produces they don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are very short and thin.  I would say probably 4mm max.  My sister in law is the person who introduced this product to me.  At first, I was a bit skeptical, but I gave it a try anyway.  The side effects I saw were eyelids darkening, but my eyelid had a darkening in a shade of pink so people thought I wore pink eye shadow everyday, which isn&#x27;t a very bad side effect to me.  I did use the serum on my upper and lower lids, but when I applied it on my lower lids, I ended up with \\&quot;raccoon\\&quot; eyes and I stopped applying on the lower lid.  I would say it took about 3 months to reach the full results.  My eyelashes grew from 4mm to 8mm.  It pretty much doubled in length and grew so much thicker!  I am happy with the product.    I didn&#x27;t give this review a 5 star because there are side effects, which is expected from ALL eyelash serum.  My side effect wasn&#x27;t horrible, but I&#x27;ve had friends and cousins who couldn&#x27;t use it.  Their eyes were red and swollen the next day.  So this product will be a hit or miss for everyone.  It does not work for 100% of the population.  I know some who can use it and some who can&#x27;t, so far it&#x27;s 50/50.  You can try it out at your own risk, but don&#x27;t expect it to work for you.  This product isn&#x27;t 100% guarantee.</li>
    <li> I had been advised to use this lash conditioner from a woman that does lash extensions.  I was told that my lashes were in bad shape.  I didn&#x27;t really think that this product would work but decided to try it.  I was amazed that my lashes have just about doubled in volume!  I was told, however, that to get the best results that I should use every night.  I would say that I use product about 80% of the time and really love the results!!!    My brows are also thin so I find that if I use on brows that they fill in as well in areas that have thin areas!</li>
    <li> I Don&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product. I tried 2-3 different kinds of eyelash enhancers before.   But, this one is totally unacceptable. I was so excited to try it when i read good comments.   However, I applied it at night. The following morning i woke up, my eyes were terrible red, kind of swollen, and itchy. It was terrible. I was glad that i had a very good eye drop to release the itchniess and redness so my eyes can recover within 3 days.     And, I requested your zone to get a refund, they reponded NONE.   Also, the one i received is unseal.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 months now and have had great results.  It takes about 2 weeks until you begin to see results.  It easy to use and no side affects for me.  I&#x27;ve had numerous people ask me if I have on false eyelashes or just tell me how beautiful my eyes are.  Several of my friends have now ordered it after seeing my results.</li>
    <li> When I bought this same exact product in August 2011 on Amazon, I purchased it for $23.00.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me how the price has doubled in only 4 months!</li>
    <li> Magical! Eyelashes growing in strong, silky and getting longer! haven&#x27;t had it long enough to report on long term use!  No burning of eyes or eye skin, no smell, bottle is full inside unlike other products much more expensive.  I will be a repeat visitor and user.  Thanks to the sender, very short waiting time to receive product. Thank you</li>
    <li> No horrible allergic reactions, even though I&#x27;m prone to those. It does make eyes a bit more red around and puffy initially, but not very noticeable. Results - there are some, I started getting compliments on my eyelashes from random people, but it takes almost 3 - 4 months to see any difference. The 3 ml  (or 4.5) tube lasted me for about 10 months, so can&#x27;t complain about the price that much, but you need patience to keep using this product religiously. And when you stop - well, as with most products like this - expect your lashes to start falling out, breaking, and going back to how they were before.  Update: I came back and updated from 3-stars to 4 stars. Why? For the past month and a half I&#x27;ve been using different lash enhancement product and during this time my lashes became thin and short again. I ll give it another month, but looks like I ll have to go back to beauty lash.</li>
    <li> I know this Is a long review but it&#x27;s worth reading. I ordered this product about 6month ago because I had my eyelash extension taking of and my eyelashes got very short in the process and it came faster than expected. When I first applied it I didn&#x27;t realize that I was using way to much until a few minutes later my eyes inside were all red(it didn&#x27;t hurt or anything just looked like a zombie) I took a few eye drops and it was fine after. When I take out the brush I wipe off a bit on the bottle and it works great. After using it for about 2 weeks twice a day I saw a big difference. My lashes grew a lot and stArted to get the natural curl. Since then I have been putting it on once every night and just love my lashes. I hadn&#x27;t seen my friend in 5 month and she thought I had fake eyelashes on. I just finished my first bottle and ordered a new one but from GNC.com it&#x27;s much cheaper and they usually have 30% off so I only paid 27$incl. Shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Ps: make sure you get the original bottle with the MD on it.</li>
    <li> I applied it every night for a month straight and now my eyelashes are so long they hit my glasses when I wear them. However, I woke up with temporary red eyes the first week I started using this, but it went away afterwards. My eyelashes are branches now.</li>
    <li> When I bought this same exact product in June 2011 on Amazon, I purchased it for $23.00.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me how the price has doubled in only 4 months!  I have used this product for 6 months, it takes a very long time to actually see the results.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  I use it every morning before putting on my makeup.  I usually give it a couple minutes to dry, then finish my makeup.  I have seen a significant increase in my eyelashes and my eyebrows!  As we age, they both tend to break off or quit growing.  My lashes look much better than they ever have in my entire life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile and have been happy with it. My lashes seem to go dormant for a while and then they start growing again. Will buy it as long as I can afford to.</li>
    <li> I dont have sensitive eyes (as far as make-ups and cosmetic products) yet this stuff bloodshot my eyes so bad people were asking me what was wrong with my eyes. I have used it for going on four days now-with NO improvement so i will have to stop using it. money down the drain...I would tell women to just not buy this product-its not worth wasting your money. im so disappointed that i even wasted the money when a little voice in the back of my head told me not to lol...</li>
    <li> I purchased Nutra-Luxe and after the first day of usage, my eyes became very red and irritated. By the end of the first day, my eyes were so swollen and sore!  I caution anyone using this product!!  I will never try one of these \\&quot;Eye Lash\\&quot; enhancements again!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Within 30 days my lashes are long!!  Have already reordered twice!!</li>
    <li> Excellenge, fast shipping....</li>
    <li> My Doctor told me about this eyelash conditioner &amp; said his sister-in-law used it. It works!! The price is a lot less than the other one. I have used it for over three weeks and can see a difference. My eyelashes are a lot longer &amp; fuller. This is one item that will make you happy.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED. MY EYES IMMEDIATELY BECAME RED AND SWOLLEN. I CONTACTED THE DISTRIBUTOR (HBA SALES, NORTH BURSWICK,NJ) AFTER HAVING TO BUY EYE DROPS AND EYE OINTMENT THAT COST MORE THAN THE PRODUCT,  AND THEY REPLIED THAT NO REFUND WOULD BE ISSUED. I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT. MY EYES ARE STILL RED AND FEEL AWFUL AFTER 3 WKS OF USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I had heard such good things about this product from my optometrist.  Her lashes looked great.  Unfortunately after giving the product a gallant try, I ended up with a really bad eye infection.  So, I do not use it around my eye line any longer.  Instead, I have been using the product on my eye brows.  I don&#x27;t use the product at night in fear that the product will somehow get into my eyes while sleeping. So I apply it immediately after I wash my face in the morning.  Results are pending.....</li>
    <li> I had used Latisse in the past and loved it but at the $120 price tag, felt that it was pricey.  At a party, I was introduced to a lady that had been using Nutra Luxe MD and had paid $75 from a permanent makeup artist for this product.  I immediately searched Amazon and found this same product for $25.  I bought a tube and within about 2 weeks noticed that I had had the same results as I did with Latisse.  I purchased 3 more tubes as Christmas gifts for my daughters and a neighbor.  All three love it.  As I am running low on my current tube, I will be repurchasing.  I constantly get comments on how long my lashes are and I can tell a difference as well.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I had lost some eyelashes due to some bad mascara, and once I started using this product my eyelashes were growing back. I noticed within the first week. I just applied at night after washing my face. Now I have long dark lashes. Hard to believe but I actually can get away without using mascara at all.</li>
    <li> I started using Nutra Luxe Lash MD on August. 2, 2011.    My eyes were red and stinging the first 10 days of use.   After 4 weeks of using it nightly my lashes started falling out in large clumps.   I ceased using the product immediately    At present (9 days later), 40% of my lashes are remaining, and sadly they are still coming out.     I have no history of any drug allergies or sensitivities.</li>
    <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, it makes your lashes fuller and they grow in length. Not as expensive as latisse.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product works, it is easy to use and only takes about 5 weeks to get results.  GREAT PRIDUCT</li>
    <li> I have been using this product regularly for over 6 weeks now and I have not noticed any changes in the appearance of my lashes. During the 6th week, I started to apply it twice a day with no luck. I would not recommend this product for anyone who is trying to grow their lashes.</li>
    <li> This works but my eyelids got red and my skin was slightly burning for a few days. Because of this, I was using this every 3 days and I could see it was working. My eyelashes were longer!! Since it clearly works well, I would recommend this product if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a month ago and I use it religiously in my lashes every night. I have noticed an improvement in the length of my eyelashes and I like to think they are getting a bit stronger too. At my age I can not expect miracles, but I&#x27;ll keep using this product and probably reorder it ones I finish this one I have now.</li>
    <li> WOW! This really works! I was very skeptical. I have used the more expensive brands that cost more than $100 with no results. However, after reading the reviews I decided it was worth a try, especially for the price. I used it every night and saw some results within two weeks and more noticeable results in a month. After two months my lashes where double in length! I did not experience any irritation but am very careful not to get it in my eyes. Make sure you buy from Nutra Luxe so you do not get a counterfeit bottle like many people have. This stuff goes a long way too. I bought the 3ml bottle back in August and I still have not needed to get a new one yet. After the first two months I use every couple of nights instead of daily because my lashes are so long :)</li>
    <li> Love this product...and it worked!!  Haven&#x27;t a clue why my lashes thinned out so much but this product really got them not only growing, but darkened them as well...I love it!!  And they&#x27;re longer than my lashes were in the first place.  Yes, Yes, Yes...Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I tried for 2 weeks so far and my eyelash seems to get grown as it seemed longer than before when I applied mascara.</li>
    <li> Citilash works much better.  This is not worth the money when other products perform better.  Nice packaging, smooth application but that&#x27;s not what I was putting first when shopping for this type of item.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 months. My eyelashes look phenomenol. I am constantly asked if I am wearing fake eyelashes. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Beautylash is my new must have!  This is my 2nd tube and my lashes have literally doubled in length.  Easy to apply (like a liquid eye liner) every evening and in a few weeks you will notice your lashes growing.  On the first 3 nights I felt very mild tingling that lasted 30 seconds and nothing since then.  I tried this assuming it wouldn&#x27;t really work and have been beyond excited at the results.  Other people are now noticing my once invisible lashes and asking me what magic mascara I have started using.  My lashes are longer, fuller and I haven&#x27;t used my eye lash curler in a few weeks.  I can&#x27;t stop staring at my eyes in the mirror!</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash enhancer, it has made a world of difference in my eyelashes. I have been asked many times what I did to my eyelashes and if they were false. many of my friends have started using it and love it too. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used revitalash when it first came out. I did experience redness and discomfort in beginning, probably from applying too much. I forgot to mention it was expensive when it first came out. I did get longer lashes but not that long where you&#x27;d see it with the naked eye or even in profile. My lashes only looked longer with mascara, which was disappointing because i wanted real longer lashes, not the appearance of them only with mascara. I didn&#x27;t get thicker or darker lashes. The thing that was bad with revitalash was that the cycle of my lashes falling out leaving bald spots that lasted at least 2weeks.  The only good thing about the product was that 1 bottle lasted almost a year. Then i tried latisse since it was prescription only so i hoped it would work without the bald spot side effect.  I really hated the separate brushes that came with the squeeze bottle so i always trimmed the thick bristle amount to thinner so i could control where i applied it, at the lash line. Again i did see some length but not that noticeable, same as revitalash, which is only evident with mascara. My lashes were not darker or thicker. And the bottle does not last long, maybe 3 months with a period of time only using it every other day. It was expensive too. I had decided to give up my dream of longer, thicker,darker lashes without make up, but looked around to see if there was any other ones (obviously a tiny kernal of the dream was alive for me to browse) and since I saw good reviews for nutralux Md on Amazon,along with the decent price compared to the other two, I decided to give it a shot.  At first I was happy that after a month I didn&#x27;t see bald spots and the lashes looked like they were getting longer, but alas, at almost 10 weeks now I do see my lashes longer but not thicker or darker and I also need mascara to see the noticeable length growth. Bad news I have bald spot on left eye that I&#x27;ve been waiting anxiously for it to fill back up. Only good news is that with mascara I cankind of mask the bald spot (which i couldn&#x27;t with revitalash). I&#x27;m nervously waiting to see if bald spot will occur in right eye (it happened in both eyes with revitalash). So out of the three--revitalash, latisse, and nutralux md--only latisse didn&#x27;t cause bald spots with my lashes during the cycle of lashes loss and growth.  I was so hoping that eyelash growth enhancers would balance very well the cycle of lashes falling out and growing so that you would always have long thick lashes as long as you use them.  I should have have known I&#x27;d never be that lucky. So with a heavy heart full of disappointment that my dream of longer thicker lashes without make up will be forever unrealized.</li>
    <li> This product does work, although my results are not as dramatic as those reported by others who use Beautylash and similar products. (I&#x27;m kind of freaked out by people who say their husbands, friends and co-workers all noticed and spontaneously commented on their amazingly long lashes!) I tried Rapidlash first, and it didn&#x27;t work for me, although most people seem to like it better than Beautylash.  A couple of months after finishing the entire tube of Rapidlash, I decided to try again.  Although I have not used Beautylash as consistently as I used Rapidlash (every night), I have had better results.  After eight weeks, my lashes are slightly longer and thicker, using it about every other night. I&#x27;m hoping my results will continue to improve. The price has increased since I bought it, but it is still less expensive than most.  I will probably order it again.  Amazon also offers it in a larger size tube.</li>
    <li> Great results! I have tried many different brands and this one actually works for me and I am over 60 years old! It is also less expensive than many brands. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got one for me and one for my sister &#x3D; we both saw eyebrow and lash growth in the couple months we used it. I stopped becuz growth was so much and now plan to start using again. We are 63 and 61 so loss of brows and eyelashes happens. Im also sensitive and was concerned about eyes watering. Like my sister said &amp;#34;just use one line of it - don&#x27;t over apply&amp;#34; and no watery eyes</li>
    <li> This product was received quickly and was exactly as advertised. My lashes look longer and thicker than ever. I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> It is true that it takes 4 to 6 weeks you really see the result but then you will have an amazing result. So much that you will have a hard to stop it afterward!</li>
    <li> Have been applying this product for over two weeks and have seen no improvement . I am applying according to instructions.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT recommend using this product.  This was the second lash growth product that I tried.  The first one was cheap from the drug store and it didn&#x27;t bother my eyes, but didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  I was excited to order this because the ingredients looked good without many chemicals.  The first time I tried it, my eyes burned and itched.  The next morning they were devil red and the redness lasted all day.  People at work asked what was wrong.  I thought I would try it a couple more times (a few weeks apart) and had the exact same experience.  I don&#x27;t know which ingredient is responsible for this, but whatever it is; I don&#x27;t recommend trying it.  I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but felt I should help others avoid my experience.</li>
    <li> After 4-5 weeks I noticed that my lashes were growing very long, almost too long so I  laid off for a while. I have sparse lower lashes at the edges so continue with the areas that need it the most, to maintain. It hasn&#x27;t made my lashes darker, though. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I also used it in conjunction with a mascara that promotes eyelash growth.</li>
    <li> Faire attention peut causer des allergies, c&#x27;est mon cas...</li>
    <li> Bought product used it faithfully every night as package said for 1 month, I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable results!!! The only thing I DID get was very blood shot eyes the entire month I used it!! I have used eyelash serums for the last 3 years no other serum has every had that effect on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy it again! I personally think it&#x27;s not the REAL NUTRA LUXE MD but that&#x27;s my opinion.</li>
    <li> My naturally blonde, thin and short lashes grew so long and much darker.  I wore only my natural lashes with mascara for my wedding.  No falsies required!  However, it DOES make my eyelids quite red, so much that it requires daily application of concealer.  My husband asked me to stop using the product because it made my eyelids red, but now I miss these lashes so much I will probably start it up again.  Impressively effective for an over the counter product.</li>
    <li> I am a senior citizen.  My lashes became very thin and short.  I started using Nutralash  MD. In 3 weeks noticed change, In 6 weeks I was thrilled. People were asking  me where I was getting my lash extensions put on.  It was great to tell them, \\&quot;they are my real lashes.\\&quot; Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this works, but it DOES!  My eyelashes are unbelievable.  Just put on once a day and in about 3 months--eyelashes!!</li>
    <li> One of my client told me to use it because the result on her were amazing I could really see the difference. With fast shipping makes it available faster...</li>
    <li> Within 2 weeks of using this product on both my eyelashes and eyebrows, I have already seen a difference. It works very well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about six months. The product does irritate your eyes, but the irritation lasts only a week or two. Please be patient when using it, the product really works! I use it three times a week now, and my lashes look beautiful and so natural. People ask me constantly if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes or if they&#x27;re mine. If you are patient, your eyebrows and lashes will definitely grow. Try it and be consistent, don&#x27;t stop it just because it irritated your eyes the first week. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have to stop using it from time to time because my eye lashes get so long they hit my sunglasses. I wish they would make them fuller, but I will take whatever I can get. It took a couple weeks for me to notice and like others have said, you can have red eyes in the morning, but eye drops would usually clear that up for me. I chose this because I was afraid to use latisse because it said that it could spot light eyes and you can&#x27;t use on the bottom lash. the 4.5 ml tube lasts me 4 - 5 months. I got all my friends using it and they all love it too.</li>
    <li> There is no color.  It is a clear liquid that lengthens lash growth and it works</li>
    <li> Seems to be working although it has not been long enough to truly say.  Eyelashes that are already there are getting longer.  Just waiting on those that have broken and out to come back. All in all, a good product with no side effects.</li>
    <li> It was way too expensive and did not help at all. I wish I could get my money back for it. I have been using it as it is specified and I am not seeing any results at all.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes have thickened and seem longer. I Have told several people about Nutra Luxe will reorder again and again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I have very short eyelashes and have wanted to try something for a long time but I didnt want to sped a ton of money on it. After 5 weeks of using it once a day (prior to going to bed) I have noticed a significant growth to them. My eyelashes are not only longer but also thicker. And I have not used half the bottle yet only a thin line is required. It took about a month for me to actually notice the growth but when I finally did I was very happy. Its worth the extra 4sec its takes to put on before going to bed. Its just takes a litle time for you to see it actually work.</li>
    <li> It takes about a month to see the effects.  It does sting if you put on too much but otherwise I had minimal side effects. It made my lashes grow longer but not fuller.  highly recommend</li>
    <li> If your eyes are the least bit sensitive I would look elsewhere.  I used this product for about 3 weeks, and my eyes were literally red and bloodshot all the time.  My co-workers were commenting!  Finally it started to make my eyes itch, and I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I keep thinking I&#x27;m seeing results, but I&#x27;m not really sure. So I just keep using it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve really been using it long enough. I&#x27;ve read excellent reviews and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;m just expecting too much too soon.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 2 years and it&#x27;s the only product that consistently works for me! I will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> I really like it.  I didn&#x27;t get any redness in my eyes like the other raters.  I am of Asian decent and my eyelashes are really growing longer! ;)  I also dab a little on my eyebrows and it also works.  Good stuff and i will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works fast and does exactly what it claims. Your lashes GROW LONG FAST.  It really is amazing.  I Love and adore this product and I could not beat the price (39.00).&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret trying it.</li>
    <li> I have always had short unnoticeable eyelashes so for Christmas this year I decided to try extensions, well, they were beautiful, but a couple weeks later, they fell off.  Along with my fake lashes went my real lashes.  I had maybe 4 or 5 individual eyelashes per eye, I couldn&#x27;t even wear mascara because I didn&#x27;t want to draw attention to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything else on the market for eyelash growth in the past and has there been some improvement? Sure, but in the case of Nutra Luxe within 8 weeks my eyelashes were back and they were longer and thicker than they have ever been.  I don&#x27;t even have to wear mascara anymore when running errands or leaving the house.  My friends have noticed, they are in awe and have bought their own supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply once in the morning and once before bed, never double dipping the brush and always alternating which eye to start with.  Truthfully I didn&#x27;t want to write this review for fear that this brand will become so popular the price skyrockets, but I was scared that if I didn&#x27;t they discontinue it, and that fear was much worse.  Moral of the story, try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed, but if you are...mail me your bottle!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product at first, for I simply bought it with a &amp;#34;why not/YOLO&amp;#34; attitude... Fast forward 4 weeks and my lashes a ridiculously longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I had to invest in redness relief eye drops for right after using it, I noticed that my eyes were very red and dry. So I recommend to those who might experience red eyes, simply put 2 drops in your eyes right after using the Nutra Luxe. Eventually, the redness will decrease considerably as your eyes will get used to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was honestly not waiting for results but this product sure is delivering.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know others feeling, but To be honest, it dosen&#x27;t work well for me. Waste money to buy it.</li>
    <li> I do NOT recommend this product.  My eyelids and the corners of my eyes  became inflamed and irritated after one use.  I have five co-workers who have also bought this product and have had the same adverse reaction to the product.  It was a waste of money.  It is unsafe to use if you have allergies or sensitive skin/eyes.</li>
    <li> works just as well as more expensive stuff!!  does everything it claims to do, great product! couldn&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
    <li> This product worked perfectly for me. After 2 months, I have curling, much longer and thicker eyelashes. It was making my eyes a little bit itchy, but, please... The result was so good, not even worth mentioning..&lt;br /&gt;This is of course what I was thinking until I realized that I had some never seen before facial hair! Not very discernible by other people, but they are right on my cheek bone, just as if extension of my eyebrows. So, I have to stop usingit, otherwise dealing with the facial hair will be more expensive and painful.</li>
    <li> This really does work....2 my surprise!!! Something that works and does what it says. You don&#x27;t find that 2 often! Will buy more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes or allergies. Have used 2 bottles of Revitalash with nothing but good results in the past. I put NutraLuxe Lash MD on the night before a large, two-day religious assembly I was to attend with over a thousand people present. I was aware of rubbing my eyes during the night because they felt itchy. When I got up in the morning, my eyes were completely bloodshot and swollen. I&#x27;ve never seen them look like that. I was shocked! I used Visine and it didn&#x27;t take the redness away. I also took Benedryl because I figured it was an allergic reaction. My eyes looked terrible for two days. Needless to say, it was very embarrassing to have to see old friends and look them in the eye. People kept asking me if there was something wrong with my eyes. I avoided talking to people because they looked so bad. I wouldn&#x27;t risk trying this before an important event. I am VERY disappointed!!! Won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
    <li> does not look like an authentic product...</li>
    <li> After using faithfully for several weeks don&#x27;t see any difference in length or thickness of my lashes.  Disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> Je trouve que le produit est de très bonne qualité et qu&#x27;il fonctionne. De plus, la livraison est rapide. C&#x27;est un produit à conseiller.</li>
    <li> My lashes grew tremendously it took about a 3 months to see results but this tube will last you about 5 months. I did put on my brows which didn&#x27;t see any difference but my lashes grew esp the end corners my lashes curls up. You&#x27;re not going to get fake falsies look so be realistic of the goal of this product. It does help grow lashes longer but not thicker or fuller and when you do wear mascara that&#x27;s where you noticed your lashes grew most because it changes the look of your eyes so much.  I&#x27;ve had long pages already but these made my eyes stand out even more. I love it.</li>
    <li> You have to consistently apply it though. Tried others before and they don&#x27;t work as well. Great value for the price as well. You don&#x27;t need to purchase the more expensive ones!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes really grew! It&#x27;s amazing. Once I had a problem on my eye but because I touched it while wearing the product,.</li>
    <li> I saw the effect in the friend´s eyelash, she told we have to wait 1 month to see the benefit</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  The only down fall is that the last 2 times I&#x27;ve ordered it, the inside plastic piece comes out which causes the product to leak out all over the place which makes me mad because I miss out on a lot of the serum.  It also irritated my eyes, burns them a little &amp; they where really red for the first week or 2 of using it (looks like you have pink eye).  That will go away once your eyes get use to it, so hang in there if this happens.  It really does a good job of growing the lashes.</li>
