      <li>but I found better sale here</li>
      <li>If you enter \\&quot;price history alert\\&quot; in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, a lot of it, and at a decent price.</li>

      <li>Keep it trimmed on the sides and maybe up to 2 inches on the top, and this shampoo keeps it clean feeling.</li>
      <li>It leaves me with a clean, refreshing feeling after I wash my hair.</li>

      <li>Surprisingly found the light smell and soft texture after the use.</li>
      <li>It generates a nice leather and you don&#x27;t have to use much each time.</li>
      <li>My husband was impressed how little he had to squeeze out for a rich lather of soap.  </li>
      <li>I love the shampoo so much, the packaging, the smell, the foam it creates, the environmental friendly bottle &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been loving it for years and found this particular formula hold moisture longer.</li>
      <li>I like the smell and my hair feels clean and silky after I rinse.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, has a light pleasant fragrance, and a clear consistency.</li>
      <li>I do love Pantene Pro-V hair cleansing products in general but my favorite is the Nature Fusion line.</li>
      <li>Helps dry hair regain strength and look nice and shiny also!</li>
      <li>Hair still blow dries quickly, too.  </li>
      <li>This Nature Fusion Moisture Balance literally saved my frazzled hair and made it smooth and shiny in the first use (I&#x27;ve now been using it for over 5 months</li>
      <li>It also gives a lot of bubbles and cleans your hair very very well!</li>
      <li>Even after using a good conditioner, the hair looked dry and dull.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So the current price of $13.70 is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I use the Moisture Balance shampoo and conditioner, and it really helps my fine, wavy hair behave.  </li>
      <li>I have used Suave most of my adult life.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this due to good reviews on this page.</li>
      <li>and they are right.</li>
      <li>I wish it left the hair smelling of a little more clean fragrance, but its still good.</li>
      <li>Finally I found a product that makes my hair bounce &amp; has transformed my lifeless hair into shiny , bouncy &amp; healthy hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon, we now have two of these jugs in our shower!</li>
      <li>Very rich lather, pretty basic shampoo.  </li>
      <li>my family uses a lot of shampoo and they only like a few brands one being pantene so this was a great price and nice big bottles.</li>
      <li>I live in NE Florida where it gets very hot and humid.  </li>
      <li>Feels very light and has alot of body after I blow dry after the wash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners and they all seem about the same, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much.</li>
      <li>It is kind of odd</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I am very displeased with this product...</li>
      <li>It also really helps detangle, saving me from split ends.  </li>
      <li>saves me so much money too.</li>
      <li>I find this tool to be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s much cheaper than retail store, ie walmart, target, etc.</li>
      <li>I could like to buy more other goods .</li>
      <li>This shampoo is a standard shampoo that keeps your hair clean.</li>
      <li>This is my new shampoo and conditioner!</li>
      <li>Decent smell.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Pantene products, but lately their prices have been too high.  </li>
      <li>The moisture balance shampoo really leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo has a nice scent. Its not overpowering at all. I like how it cleans my hair and its very soft and manageable. Feels very light and has alot of body after I blow dry after the wash. This shampoo is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Several months ago I switched to using Pantene shampoo and my hair feels softer and easier to manage.  I like the smell of the shampoo as well. It generates a nice leather and you don&#x27;t have to use much each time. One bottle goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the last year the price varied from 15.48 to 13.29. So the current price of $13.70 is pretty good.  I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter \\&quot;price history alert\\&quot; in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool to be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Pantene Pro-v Nature Fusion shampoo and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used to use Dove but then wanted to try out this product because I heard so many good reviews on this. However after a few washes, I realized how this shampoo was totally drying out my hair and overtime created dry, brittle strands. I am very displeased with this product... I switched back to Dove (:</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a standard shampoo that keeps your hair clean. Not much more to say about it than that.</li>
    <li> I have been trying products for a long time to find a haircare product that suits my hair.Finally I found a product that makes my hair bounce &amp; has transformed my lifeless hair into shiny , bouncy &amp; healthy hair.I&#x27;m soo in love with the way my hair feels after using this. U shud give it a try.</li>
    <li> Pantene is the ONLY shampoo I use now! I have dry hair because I am always curling and dying, etc, etc. The moisture balance shampoo really leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable. And I love the scent! I swear it is just as good as the expensive salon brand shampoos. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I do love Pantene Pro-V hair cleansing products in general but my favorite is the Nature Fusion line. It leaves me with a clean, refreshing feeling after I wash my hair. I don&#x27;t have any sort of major scalp problems. I use this because it really does my make hair less dry and a bit smoother and shinier.</li>
    <li> this produce leaves my fine hair soft without weighing it down. i have hard well water, and this works in spite of that.</li>
    <li> I used gym shampoo after swimming for convenience. Cannot believe how terrible it was. It helps me to appreciate Pantene more. I&#x27;ve been loving it for years and found this particular formula hold moisture longer.</li>
    <li> This makes my scalp feel so clean and smells so nice, it&#x27;s a very fresh and light scent. It really is a great product. I like the 2 pack as well saves me so much money too. And I get the conditioner as well. I haven&#x27;t had to buy shampoo or conditioner in months and I still have half a bottle left (still on the first bottle). You really only need a tiny bit it goes a long way and same for the conditioner. This is true for long hair too. Now my hair is short so I can use even less and it lasts longer now!</li>
    <li> I ordered it since I ran out of shampoo. Surprisingly found the light smell and soft texture after the use. Like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price, i cannot expect for more.</li>
    <li> Purchased this due to good reviews on this page. Just like the below customer, it really dried out my hair. When I lathered it, it tangles my hair. This shampoo is also in gel so I would recommend going for creamy if you have dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to do with this shampoo? I&#x27;m not too sure :(</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo so much, the packaging, the smell, the foam it creates, the environmental friendly bottle &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This was recently on sale at my local grocery store so I decided to try it. I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners and they all seem about the same, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much. I love the Nature Fusion shampoo and conditioner! My hair is so soft now! This is my new shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, the best shampoo on the market right now! It has everything I look for in a shampoo. It&#x27;s gentle, has a light pleasant fragrance, and a clear consistency. It&#x27;s also Paraben-free and contains aloe vera which is so beneficial to hair and scalp. Creamy shampoos often weigh my hair down which is why I switched to this shampoo. I was afraid it would be too drying since most clear shampoos are but to my surprise, it left my hair looking and feeling healthy and youthful. Hair hasn&#x27;t felt this full in a long time. I&#x27;ve tried over 40 shampoos (from salon ones to sulfate-free ones) and none compare to this product. The product is infused with Panthenol which does thicken hair over time and this is Pantene&#x27;s gentlest shampoo in terms of formula/ingredients. I get consistently good results with this shampoo and have no plans to switch shampoos. Thank you, Pantene, for producing such a terrific product. A real joy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, a lot of it, and at a decent price. I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> GREAT HAIR COMES OUT CLEAN</li>
    <li> I have used Suave most of my adult life.  Someone told me this is a great product and they are right. My hair is soft and silky after I use this conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and large size bottles. Helps dry hair regain strength and look nice and shiny also! Def buy this product</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is the best pantene pro-v product on the market!  I would definately buy again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great.  I have just enough curl in my hair that it tends to frizz a little.  Just used this shampoo for the 1st time and no frizz!    [[ASIN:B001JQLNRS Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion Shampoo, Moisture Balance, 25.4-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> Am a guy with thick hair that can get oily if not regularly washed. Keep it trimmed on the sides and maybe up to 2 inches on the top, and this shampoo keeps it clean feeling. Play volleyball and tennis and really have the need to shower well after matches (else my wife will kick me back outside to do yard-work or something until I have time to clean up!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is how a little bit goes a very long way... a small squirt in my hand that is about the size of a quarter gives me really good suds, so this size bottle lasts a very long time -- even when doing a quick wash at least 5 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went through the gamut of designer shampoos, and those with green tea and mint, only to come back to this Pantene product. Some of the others felt just about as nice as this one does, but they ended up irritating my scalp sometimes whereas Pantene never does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price, Can&#x27;t wait to try the procuct. I know Im going to love it !! !</li>
    <li> Very rich lather, pretty basic shampoo.  Decent smell.  Cleanses well.  Nothing much more to it.  Not overly drying.  I use this to get styling products off my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is very good, this is a wonderful experience online. I will buy this item again online. It&#x27;s new.~~~~</li>
    <li> my family uses a lot of shampoo and they only like a few brands one being pantene so this was a great price and nice big bottles.</li>
    <li> smells very good and a lot of foam when in use</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. It made my hair extremely dry and staticky. I stopped using this product and tried another one. My hair, then, improved drastically. Stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> For the money it is good. It is kind of odd that the price used to be 6 dollars and now it is 25, no idea what happened. Will start to use next week</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m not gonna buy this anymore. Pantene is too dry for the hair. I think I have to find something else.</li>
    <li> Has a wonderful fragrance in a big bottle.  Bought the conditioner to complement the shampoo.  I&#x27;ve always liked Pantene products, but lately their prices have been too high.  Thanks to Amazon, we now have two of these jugs in our shower!</li>
    <li> Can always count on Pantene Pro-V to make a good product.  This one delivers a nice shampoo experience and my hair is easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Great product and cleans well. I wish it left the hair smelling of a little more clean fragrance, but its still good. Shampoos/Conditioner seem so over priced, i would only recommend if you find a deal on it. If you&#x27;re happy with the price, you&#x27;ll be happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and have ordered it from Amazon before, but the latest batch is a different kind!  Instead of just NatureFusion, it is the one with Melon Essence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon please fix your product description / photo and send me the correct product.</li>
    <li> This product is great and two for the bargain price really makes it a very good bargain for everyone out there.</li>
    <li> Nice and moisturizing, if used along with a conditioner.  It&#x27;s a good idea to change your shampoo once in a while.</li>
    <li> I love it because the price is the cheapest I could find. I could like to buy more other goods .</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo the ending of last month, because I got the news the price was 2 for $3.5. I just recieved this morning, it is great!!!!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this brand for a while but it&#x27;s nice to resume.  The sense is good and hair feels very smooth after using it.  We got it when there is a deal so it&#x27;s much cheaper than retail store, ie walmart, target, etc.</li>
    <li> I live in NE Florida where it gets very hot and humid.  I use the Moisture Balance shampoo and conditioner, and it really helps my fine, wavy hair behave.  It also really helps detangle, saving me from split ends.  Hair still blow dries quickly, too.  This is an excellent product; I hope Pantene continues this variety.</li>
    <li> great price and good product too.</li>
    <li> Have not use it yet. I think it is a very good deal compared with that I get in the local grocery store.</li>
    <li> Good price, good size. Saved a lot of money by subscribing.&lt;br /&gt;Amazons convenience is great.&lt;br /&gt;Product Cleans well and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I got this purchase for a great price and for no shipping cost.  So if you can get this deal.....almost 25.4 ounces for  around $1.50.  Better deal than buying Suave at Walmart....and it&#x27;s a Pantene product.  Cleans hair well and leaves it soft even without conditioner.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the Pantene Pro-V NatureFusion Shampoo.  My husband was impressed how little he had to squeeze out for a rich lather of soap.  I like the smell and my hair feels clean and silky after I rinse.  I certainly will buy Pantene Pro-V NatureFusion Shampoo again and will be happy to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for less than 5dollars I think.&lt;br /&gt;But I heard pantene has some effect on hair loss (not proofed).&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if my hair loss (not a lot but more than before) was caused by this product or I was just overwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use conditioner though. Maybe that&#x27;s the reason?&lt;br /&gt;overall, it&#x27;s a good deal</li>
    <li> It is one of the worst shampoos to use, as it makes your hair very dry and dull. Even after using a good conditioner, the hair looked dry and dull.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t achieve the same results even with store brand bodywash.</li>
    <li> Pantene is the only thing I swear by.. Well specifically their Nature Fusion line. As a swimmer and daily surfer, my hair is always such a frizzy mess that needs a lot of special chlorine-cleansing shampoos and leave-in conditioners to tame. This Nature Fusion Moisture Balance literally saved my frazzled hair and made it smooth and shiny in the first use (I&#x27;ve now been using it for over 5 months and it still gives me great results). I use this shampoo along with Pantene&#x27;s Smooth conditoner and my thick chestnut brown wavy hair always gets compliments. When I get asked what shampoo I use, I am proud to say its Pantene!</li>
    <li> I had to give it away to my roommate because it was making my hair and scalp really dry. I&#x27;ve been using Pantene Shampoo and Conditioner for over 6 years and none of their products ever gave me such bad results. My roommate also said she got really bad dandruff after using it for a week (2 washes). I&#x27;d stick with their other shampoos that are maybe slightly easier on the scalp and the dryness. Personally, I&#x27;m going to try Head &amp; Shoulders for a little.</li>
    <li> I used to buy Pantene shampoo from Costco when it goes on sale but I found better sale here and it&#x27;s moisture balance! Score! It also gives a lot of bubbles and cleans your hair very very well! I love Pantene, do more discount!</li>
    <li> Works great.  What&#x27;s there to say about shampoo.  I have short hair so tangles are not an issue.  This shampoo leaves my hair as clean and smelling as nice as any I have tried.  I will buy it again.</li>
