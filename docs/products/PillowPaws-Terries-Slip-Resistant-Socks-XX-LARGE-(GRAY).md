      <li>more words are now required)</li>
      <li>great product, fast shipping</li>
      <li>that barely fit my size 11 feet!</li>
      <li>The fit nicely and don&#x27;t bag.  </li>
      <li>These Terries are the most comfortable and long-wearing slipper socks that I have come across for my feet.  </li>
      <li>But I ended up giving them to my wife ( she&#x27;s a 9.5) and they fit her</li>
      <li>These have really helped with be more sure of walking knowing that the bottoms are slip free.</li>
      <li>The socks ARE probably worth the $7.98 with the free shipping...</li>
      <li>Really good for walking around the house, especially with winter onthe way.</li>
      <li>Fit is good as they really are men&#x27;s extra-large and fit well on an American size 12 foot.</li>
      <li>BUT these XXL socks barely fit my feet, stretching EXACTLY to the maximum toe tips of my feet.</li>
      <li>They fit good and last much longer than those issued from the hospital.</li>
      <li>Good socks, high quality and still going strong a year later</li>

      <li>I always have trouble finding large enough slip free socks and these fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>Based on other posts, we bought a larger size - an XX-Large, which fits his size 10 foot perfectly.</li>
      <li>We were first introduced to them in the hospital</li>
      <li>I may order several more.</li>
      <li>these socks claim to be double tread,which everyone knows means tread on top and bottom of sock(double)BUT</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s where she first encountered these socks.  </li>
      <li>The price was right and they are really durable.</li>
      <li>They fit ok and don&#x27;t seem to be too tight once he&#x27;s wearing them, though.</li>
      <li>Spend a little more and get yourself a legitimatepair of heavier, better made non-slip actual &amp;#34;Terri cloth&amp;#34; socks.</li>
      <li>These are very well made and have withstood lots of washing.  </li>
      <li>She really like them.</li>
      <li>Very durable item...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ll be able to get them on then, but unless that becomes a more regular occurrence, I&#x27;ll probably order this size again.</li>
      <li>Bought for a relative to have as extras need several more.</li>
      <li>When I enquired about returning these cheap, knock-offs, NOT Tiger Paws brand socks, the seller, called Treasure Zone wanted a restocking fee and to charge me 2 dollars for the &amp;#34;free shipping&amp;#34; I got when i ordered, but now they want to charge me 2 dollars for returning the socks...effectively making it a total loss of my money to return these cheap socks I purchased thinking they were Tiger Paws, DOUBLE treaded, &amp;#34;Terries&amp;#34; AND extra extra Large,</li>
      <li>My husband has wide feet and these XX Large sox are exactly like what he had in the hospital.  </li>
      <li>First of all, I received a gray pair of XXL - (extra extra large socks) that were NOT &amp;</li>
      <li>on top and bottom of sock is great in case the socks are put on in the dark..there will be tread on the&lt;br /&gt;bottom of the foot no matter how twisted the sock is put on!!!  </li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
      <li>If you are a guy with 11.5 feet, or 11 size feet that are WIDE, then absolutely FORGET ABOUT THESE SOCKS!</li>
      <li>Treasure Zone &amp;#60;--- more like the Rip-Off Zone.</li>
      <li>Finally, I have size 11 feet and my feet are pretty narrow, and the size chart actually printed on the package the socks come in says: XXL &#x3D;  12-13 men&#x27;s shoe size.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband first discovered these in the hospital and found them to be perfect for scooting around the house. The price was right and they are really durable. Wash , dry wear.. A good deal..  If you want, I think they will put a name on them for you. but we didn&#x27;t need that..</li>
    <li> The non-slip socks have been a life-safer to me.  I suffer from Muscular Dystrophy and have a problem trying to walk.  Several times I would have slipped and fallen had it not been for the slip resistant socks.</li>
    <li> I ordered these in XXL for my father, who wears a size 11 regular men&#x27;s shoe, and we find them a little tough to get on. They fit ok and don&#x27;t seem to be too tight once he&#x27;s wearing them, though. His feet occasionally swell and I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ll be able to get them on then, but unless that becomes a more regular occurrence, I&#x27;ll probably order this size again.</li>
    <li> Even though the plastic bag says XXL, anyone by looking at the package could tell that these socks are no more than a medium or large.&lt;br /&gt;I have a  pair from a local hospital and I wear a size 9 ladies shoe.  I am returning the product.  From that company, the yellow ones are XXL.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> They are tube socks, and as such have a lousy fit.&lt;br /&gt;Try something else.&lt;br /&gt;(Six more words are now required)</li>
    <li> For physical reasons, I cannot walk around the house in shoes.  These Terries are the most comfortable and long-wearing slipper socks that I have come across for my feet.  I recommend them to anyone looking for a good slipper sock.</li>
    <li> these socks claim to be double tread,which everyone knows means tread on top and bottom of sock(double)BUT&lt;br /&gt;they are single tread.. on one side only..the second set of  tread goes up  the ankle(where it is not needed).&lt;br /&gt;tread on top and bottom of sock is great in case the socks are put on in the dark..there will be tread on the&lt;br /&gt;bottom of the foot no matter how twisted the sock is put on!!!  NOT GONNA HAPPEN WITH THESE SOCKS!!</li>
    <li> My husband had surgery and needed to wear &amp;#34;sticky socks&amp;#34; to prevent him from falling.  The socks from the hospital were horrible.  These are very well made and have withstood lots of washing.  The fit nicely and don&#x27;t bag.  Based on other posts, we bought a larger size - an XX-Large, which fits his size 10 foot perfectly.</li>
    <li> Recipient likes th non-skid sole. Fit is good as they really are men&#x27;s extra-large and fit well on an American size 12 foot.</li>
    <li> I worry about my elderly mom slipping and falling on the wood flooring.  These help a great deal with that... We were first introduced to them in the hospital and I ordered her some for home..Very durable item...</li>
    <li> Way too expensive for one pair of socks. I thought I was getting 3 pair, not one</li>
    <li> great ty these fit just right love them plus are safe due to the rubbery things on the bottom and they are warm</li>
    <li> Bought these for a friend in BE.  She really like them.</li>
    <li> Good socks, high quality and still going strong a year later</li>
    <li> We were in an accident and my wife had to be hospitalized and then in rehab for a couple of weeks.  That&#x27;s where she first encountered these socks.  We purchased these for her to  wear around the house.  She has since recovered and she still wears them.</li>
    <li> Double sided skid resistant socks are difficult to find,  What I received fit well over athletic socks so I can use them as inside shoes.</li>
    <li> Just not as big as expected. Because they are double sided they didn&#x27;t stretch as well as needed.Quality is very good though.</li>
    <li> i got it but with different design</li>
    <li> Bought for a relative to have as extras need several more. Warm and comfy.</li>
    <li> As advertised and expected. Good product.</li>
    <li> These are really good &amp;#34;socky feet,&amp;#34; much better than others advertised. I may order several more. Really good for walking around the house, especially with winter onthe way.</li>
    <li> I always have trouble finding large enough slip free socks and these fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> These socks were just as advertised and then some.  They fit good and last much longer than those issued from the hospital.</li>
    <li> These socks were purchased for my elderly father.  He suffers from diabetes and cannot feel his feet.  These have really helped with be more sure of walking knowing that the bottoms are slip free.</li>
    <li> My husband has wide feet and these XX Large sox are exactly like what he had in the hospital.  Perfect for him.</li>
    <li> First of all, I received a gray pair of XXL - (extra extra large socks) that were NOT &amp;#34;Tiger Paws&amp;#34; as pictured in the Amazon ad. There is no &amp;#34;happy face,&amp;#34; icon on my socks, and the tread pattern is NOT anything like the &amp;#34;arrow&amp;#34; pattern shown on the &amp;#34;Tiger Paws.&amp;#34; In fact, these ARE NOT Tiger Paws at all! So why the false advertisement?  Why is this allowed?  Secondly, the tread is ONLY on the soles of the socks, so they&#x27;re NOT &amp;#34;Double&amp;#34; tread -- as stated in the Amazon ad.  Finally, I have size 11 feet and my feet are pretty narrow, and the size chart actually printed on the package the socks come in says: XXL &#x3D;  12-13 men&#x27;s shoe size. BUT these XXL socks barely fit my feet, stretching EXACTLY to the maximum toe tips of my feet. If you are a guy with 11.5 feet, or 11 size feet that are WIDE, then absolutely FORGET ABOUT THESE SOCKS! They are way TOO small for any guy with larger than 11 size feet (or 10.5 - 11 WIDE feet) -- PERIOD.  I&#x27;m going to contact Amazon about these sellers showing &#x27;Tiger Paws&#x27; brand photo, describing the socks as being DOUBLE treaded, and then baiting and switching you with some other socks!  The socks ARE probably worth the $7.98 with the free shipping...BUT they aren&#x27;t what is being advertised in this ad at all.  PS:  These socks are also NOT &amp;#34;terries&amp;#34;... they are slick, very thin, polyester, that offer zero warmth for cold weather. When I enquired about returning these cheap, knock-offs, NOT Tiger Paws brand socks, the seller, called Treasure Zone wanted a restocking fee and to charge me 2 dollars for the &amp;#34;free shipping&amp;#34; I got when i ordered, but now they want to charge me 2 dollars for returning the socks...effectively making it a total loss of my money to return these cheap socks I purchased thinking they were Tiger Paws, DOUBLE treaded, &amp;#34;Terries&amp;#34; AND extra extra Large, that barely fit my size 11 feet! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Spend a little more and get yourself a legitimatepair of heavier, better made non-slip actual &amp;#34;Terri cloth&amp;#34; socks. This seller is a crook...Treasure Zone &amp;#60;--- more like the Rip-Off Zone.</li>
    <li> If one needs these hospital-type socks.  I recommend this vendor.  They provide a good value for the price.  Check out others &amp; you&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I have size 12 feet and one of them swells 2-3 times that. I used to be able to wear x-large so I figured xx would work. But I ended up giving them to my wife ( she&#x27;s a 9.5) and they fit her</li>
