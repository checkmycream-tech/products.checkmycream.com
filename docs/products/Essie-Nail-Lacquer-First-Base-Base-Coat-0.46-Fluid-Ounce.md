### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>LOL!</li>
      <li>Excellent products!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s probably not the best either.</li>
      <li>I did not get the best wear time out of this however, my nails where chipping on the tips and even the sides of my nails in 2-3 days.</li>
      <li>Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
      <li>Very impressive, indeed!</li>
      <li>Works great for any brand of polish, too!</li>
      <li>Keeps the color on and bright!</li>
      <li>Like all Essie products, this performs great.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Use with top coat too!</li>
      <li>I just used it and the Essie Good to Go top coat  </li>
      <li>When I found it here I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m on day 6 and they still look great.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my nail polish on longer and it dries very quickly!</li>
      <li>I love it works great and dries fast!</li>
      <li>i do think it is worthwhile for bonding and perhaps staining, but still not so sure.  </li>
      <li>I love Essie polish</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the top coat</li>
      <li>I love this brand and your nails don&#x27;t turn yellowish</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a good price on here too ;)</li>
      <li>I can say I am not disappointed at all!</li>
      <li>There just isn&#x27;t anything so super amazing about this that made it deserve 5 stars.</li>
      <li>edges still fade on nails easily.</li>
      <li>and it made my polish look super shiny even before my top coat this will be bought again.</li>
      <li>It has made a huge difference in the polishes appearance.</li>
      <li>thought it would make the polish last longer, can&#x27;t say that i&#x27;ve noticed great change.  </li>
      <li>The prices are fairly cheap and tempting, but save yourself the hardache.</li>
      <li>Well, with the higher ratings, it seems that some people had way better luck than me</li>
      <li>Drying fast is very important to me because I&#x27;m always on the run.</li>
      <li>The only good thing...</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s true</li>
      <li>dries really quick</li>
      <li>Great product at less than retail price.</li>
      <li>I love Essie polishes because of their consistency and their perfectly sized brushes (not to big, not to small).</li>
      <li>My nails look like there fresh out of the salon</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product if you are one that does your own nails.</li>
      <li>It makes home pedicures easier and more professional looking.</li>
      <li>but this REALLY helps!</li>
      <li>much lighter than the bottle I bought at the salon when my manicure chipped off after just 1 day!</li>
      <li>I am really liking Essie&#x27;s nail treatments!</li>
      <li>Thanks guys!</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less than amazing.</li>
      <li>Pros:  keeps my nails from staining when using deep colors; applies easily; dries quickly&lt;</li>
      <li>It dried very quickly and had a good slightly rough consistency so that the color nail polish can stick to it well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even hard to get it off because this is so good.</li>
      <li>: none really.</li>
      <li>really smooths out the ridges in nails.  </li>
      <li>This stuff helps so much.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to prevent or keep my nails from chipping.  </li>
      <li>i do my own manicures and recently noticed my nails turning yellow from the colors i have been using.</li>
      <li>However, excuse the impending brags, this was on vacation, so I wasn&#x27;t doing many dishes or chores, though I was frequently swimming in the sandy ocean...</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m a nurse) and all those other daily activities that typically ruin my perfect mani within 24 hours.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using this for the first time and so far it seems to deliver.</li>
      <li>Essie is my favorite nail polish hands down.</li>
      <li>I have used only with other Essie nail colors and top coat, but the system together looks nice and lasts longer than other topcoat/polish combos I have used.</li>
      <li>I could never get regular polish to last more than a day or two without chipping.  </li>
      <li>Creates a very nice smooth first base, shiny if just used by itself too.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice base coat, goes on smoothly and can be used with or without a nail polish...</li>
      <li>I decided to try this base coat after falling for Essie&#x27;s Good to Go top coat, and the base coat is great too!</li>
      <li>I have yet to have the time to apply nail polish now that I&#x27;m back to real life (not brag) with chores and VERY frequent hand hygiene</li>
      <li>The shipping was a little slow but the great quality of the polish made up for that.</li>
      <li>yes yes&lt;br /&gt;Works very well and leaves your manicure lasting longer.</li>
      <li>Manicure will last five days and it dries fast.</li>
      <li>This base coat is awesome!</li>
      <li>this is the best base coat i have ever found.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other brand names on a regular basis but i always go back to Essie.</li>
      <li>It dries pretty fast and protects my nails from chipping for about 2 weeks or even a little longer.</li>
      <li>The first step of a few that I was missing when giving myself a manicure, so glad it was recommended to me.</li>
      <li>Goes on nicely and gives a strong base.</li>
      <li>I needed a good base coat, and this one does the trick, although I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than any other one I have tried, as far as staying power goes.</li>
      <li>This is a really good nail base to give your nails that first layer of protecton against cracks, splitting, etc.</li>
      <li>The base was lovely though and complemented the already exceedingly easy application of Essie polishes.</li>
      <li>This basecoat keeps the polish on my nails much longer then any other I have tried.</li>

<li> If you are looking for a fast drying base coat that helps you get your nails done quickly, and you don&#x27;t care that they last for a whole week</li>
<li> This base is amazing!  </li>
<li> They got really dry with white spots all over the nails.</li>
<li> I have VERY thin nails, so my nailpolish tends to chip within 24 hours (huge bummer), but so far, this appears to have staying power, though there has been some slight chipping at the tips.</li>

<li> Overall, it&#x27;s not a horrible base coat</li>
<li> This base coat is magical</li>
<li> I even bought and applied the Essie nail polish and top coat with the base.</li>
<li> i love this base coat</li>
<li> This seems watered down.</li>
<li> The First Base I buy at the salon is a nice thicker base coat.</li>
<li> Not very pleased.</li>
<li> What a waste of my money.</li>
<li> I was looking for a good base coat that wasn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
<li> Dries quickly, and haven&#x27;t noticed any staining yet from the polishes I&#x27;ve been using over the base.</li>
<li> I saw that the vendor also had First Base, and for much less than I pay at the salon.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m expecting too much from a base coat, but I am rather disappointed especially since I am usually such a fan of Essie products.</li>
<li> and I can&#x27;t say that this was the best base coat, but it also wasn&#x27;t the worst.</li>
<li> I have used several different base coats before</li>
<li> but this is my first experience with the base coat</li>
<li> After using this base coat I noticed my manicure lasts much longer than it use to.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference between when I use this base coat and when I use none.</li>

    <li> Like all Essie products, this performs great.  It makes home pedicures easier and more professional looking.</li>
    <li> This is a really good nail base to give your nails that first layer of protecton against cracks, splitting, etc.</li>
    <li> Helps my nail polish stick longer. I don&#x27;t know what else I can ask for in a base coat. yup</li>
    <li> I needed a good base coat, and this one does the trick, although I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than any other one I have tried, as far as staying power goes. But I do like Essie, so I stuck with this brand.</li>
    <li> Excellent products! I have tried many other brand names on a regular basis but i always go back to Essie.</li>
    <li> I do my nails myself all the time, so  when I use this oil, it makes my nails look like I went to get them done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for the first time and so far it seems to deliver. I have VERY thin nails, so my nailpolish tends to chip within 24 hours (huge bummer), but so far, this appears to have staying power, though there has been some slight chipping at the tips. Overall, it appears to grip the color well and Essie is a reliable brand.</li>
    <li> This basecoat keeps the polish on my nails much longer then any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> i love this base coat</li>
    <li> I love this brand and your nails don&#x27;t turn yellowish</li>
    <li> This base coat is magical I just used it and the Essie Good to Go top coat  I&#x27;ve been using the top coat but this is my first experience with the base coat and it made my polish look super shiny even before my top coat this will be bought again. My nails look like there fresh out of the salon</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift.  She loves it!  I would definitely buy this product again.  It is the best base coat I have found!</li>
    <li> Keeps the color on and bright! Use with top coat too! Manicure will last five days and it dries fast. Essie is my favorite nail polish hands down. Except for the metallic colors, but that&#x27;s another review.</li>
    <li> Another nail product that promised to keep my polish on longer, but it lasted 3 days. I even bought and applied the Essie nail polish and top coat with the base. Still only 3 days. This is way too expensive for that. I am moving on to try something else. What a waste of my money. Well, with the higher ratings, it seems that some people had way better luck than me LOL!</li>
    <li> Not very pleased. I&#x27;ve purchased this base coat from the nail salon for a few years. I was looking for a specific color polish that I could find in stores or the salon... When I found it here I was thrilled. I saw that the vendor also had First Base, and for much less than I pay at the salon. I was almost out, so I figured I would give it a whirl. I guess it&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for. The First Base I buy at the salon is a nice thicker base coat. This seems watered down. Even the color is wrong... much lighter than the bottle I bought at the salon when my manicure chipped off after just 1 day! The only good thing... I didn&#x27;t waste much money.</li>
    <li> I bought this becuase i do my own manicures and recently noticed my nails turning yellow from the colors i have been using. And so i bought this in the hopes that it would prevent my nails from turning yellow in the future. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Pros:  keeps my nails from staining when using deep colors; applies easily; dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none really. There just isn&#x27;t anything so super amazing about this that made it deserve 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference between when I use this base coat and when I use none. It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my nail polish last any longer or prevent chips. Sometimes the entire coat of polish will peel off my nail a day or two after applying this beneath my color coat. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m expecting too much from a base coat, but I am rather disappointed especially since I am usually such a fan of Essie products.</li>
    <li> I put this on before applying Essie nail polish and my polish lasted almost unscathed for a week! Very impressive, indeed! However, excuse the impending brags, this was on vacation, so I wasn&#x27;t doing many dishes or chores, though I was frequently swimming in the sandy ocean... so, maybe the chipping forces balance out? I have yet to have the time to apply nail polish now that I&#x27;m back to real life (not brag) with chores and VERY frequent hand hygiene (I&#x27;m a nurse) and all those other daily activities that typically ruin my perfect mani within 24 hours. The base was lovely though and complemented the already exceedingly easy application of Essie polishes. I would definitely this recommend product.</li>
    <li> I am really liking Essie&#x27;s nail treatments! I decided to try this base coat after falling for Essie&#x27;s Good to Go top coat, and the base coat is great too! Dries quickly, and haven&#x27;t noticed any staining yet from the polishes I&#x27;ve been using over the base. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice base coat, goes on smoothly and can be used with or without a nail polish...</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading the reviews. I can say I am not disappointed at all! After using this base coat I noticed my manicure lasts much longer than it use to. I was using OPI for Sephora all in one. It started to get really thick and made my nails look horrible. This base coat is awesome! I would definitely recommend this product if you are one that does your own nails.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem to prevent or keep my nails from chipping.  I have the same results with it as I do without using it.</li>
    <li> Great product at less than retail price. Get it!!</li>
    <li> Product should have been in box, it came without one.  Box shown in picture.  If I got a box it would have instructions of use, and would show ingredients.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  The first step of a few that I was missing when giving myself a manicure, so glad it was recommended to me. It has made a huge difference in the polishes appearance. A must for anyone who does their nails.</li>
    <li> Best base coat ever! It&#x27;s even hard to get it off because this is so good. Some people think base coat maybe isn&#x27;t needed but this REALLY helps! And it&#x27;s a good price on here too ;)</li>
    <li> Does the job just like any other base coat out there! Works great for any brand of polish, too!</li>
    <li> this is the best base coat i have ever found.</li>
    <li> This base is amazing!  I could never get regular polish to last more than a day or two without chipping.  Right now I&#x27;m on day 6 and they still look great.  I would heartily recommend!</li>
    <li> thought it would make the polish last longer, can&#x27;t say that i&#x27;ve noticed great change.  i do think it is worthwhile for bonding and perhaps staining, but still not so sure.  edges still fade on nails easily.</li>
    <li> Yes yes yes yes yes yes&lt;br /&gt;Works very well and leaves your manicure lasting longer. I recommend this product (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a base coat before and just did a clear nail polish. Well, it ruined my nails. They got really dry with white spots all over the nails. I&#x27;ve been using the essie base coat for a couple of weeks now and already seeing the improvement. Will never put a nail polish without a base coat ever again!</li>
    <li> really smooths out the ridges in nails.  great base coat i wont put polish on without it.  dries really quick so its a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I love it works great and dries fast! Drying fast is very important to me because I&#x27;m always on the run.</li>
    <li> The shipping was a little slow but the great quality of the polish made up for that. I love Essie polish so I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less than amazing. It dries pretty fast and protects my nails from chipping for about 2 weeks or even a little longer. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> I love Essie polishes because of their consistency and their perfectly sized brushes (not to big, not to small). Because I liked their nail polishes so much I decided to try their base coat. I have used several different base coats before and I can&#x27;t say that this was the best base coat, but it also wasn&#x27;t the worst. It dried very quickly and had a good slightly rough consistency so that the color nail polish can stick to it well. I did not get the best wear time out of this however, my nails where chipping on the tips and even the sides of my nails in 2-3 days. Overall, it&#x27;s not a horrible base coat but it&#x27;s probably not the best either. If you are looking for a fast drying base coat that helps you get your nails done quickly, and you don&#x27;t care that they last for a whole week, this is base coat for you. If you are looking for a long wearing base coat, I would try something else.</li>
    <li> Either it&#x27;s my nail beds, or, this product.  Nail polish would peel off within a few days even with this base coat.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I have an issue with nail polish chipping off like 2 or 3 days after I paint them. This stuff helps so much. Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good base coat that wasn&#x27;t too expensive. This does the job. It keeps my nail polish on longer and it dries very quickly! Love it</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely and gives a strong base.</li>
    <li> Creates a very nice smooth first base, shiny if just used by itself too. I have used only with other Essie nail colors and top coat, but the system together looks nice and lasts longer than other topcoat/polish combos I have used.</li>
    <li> I just received it not to long ago. The only thing that worries me is that this might be a knockoff and I would advise anybody whos buying nail polish on amazon. DON&#x27;T ! The prices are fairly cheap and tempting, but save yourself the hardache.</li>
