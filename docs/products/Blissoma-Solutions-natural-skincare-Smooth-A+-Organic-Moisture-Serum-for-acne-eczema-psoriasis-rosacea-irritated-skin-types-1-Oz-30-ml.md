      <li>and I just love it.  </li>

      <li>This said it was ok for that  </li>
      <li>THIS HAS WORKED WONDERFULLY FOR ME.I HAVE REALLY RED CHEEKS</li>
      <li>What I like most about it is that it&#x27;s organic and not too pricey.</li>
      <li>SO I COULD BUY IT MORE.</li>
      <li>Lovely, huh?  </li>

      <li>but the more I used it</li>
      <li>This product is fabulous!</li>
      <li>Def buying more.</li>
      <li>I love this serum.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s effective, affordable, and most importantly, totally free of harmful ingredients.</li>
      <li>It is liquid magic in a bottle.  </li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>As a 45 y/o menopausal woman this is the best facial product on the market.  </li>
      <li>One more thing I&#x27;ve noticed is my fine wrinkles started disappearing.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Smooth.</li>
      <li>It may be a fine product, but not for roseacea.  </li>
      <li>And the niacinamide is a great ingredient that not only helps with breakouts, but also can help prevent and lessen wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>Transaction went smoothly as well, would buy again.</li>
      <li>This is such a great product.</li>
      <li>I use it as an all over treatment and as a spot treatment as Blissoma suggests and I find that it truly helps my skin look and as the name suggests SMOOTH.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews, I decided to try Smooth A+.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it goes on smoothly and smells like the stuff that&#x27;s used for facials at botanical spas.</li>
      <li>cause I have never used it before I just want a free sample.</li>
      <li>I thought that a natural product would be good.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>Wow.. amazing product.</li>
      <li>I am in my mid forties and have fair, oily/combination, acneic skin.</li>
      <li>yea its cool.</li>
      <li>cool product.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a trial sample, and I will be purchasing the full size.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
      <li>Well let&#x27;s count all the 2 line reviews posted on December 19, 2011 by reviewers who all think it&#x27;s great how organic the product is and who don&#x27;t have any other reviews.</li>
      <li>It provides just the perfect amount of moisture for my combination skin, it&#x27;s a great base layer for mineral makeup, and it soothes redness and irritation.</li>
      <li>I love the texture of it (it has a nice slip to it), and how truly moisturizing it is, how it sinks into my skin.</li>
      <li>It made my face itchy and caused mild rashes.</li>
      <li>I love all the natural ingredients too - no weird chemicals!</li>
      <li>Its not too greasy or heavy and has a great smell.</li>
      <li>It is light and has a good exfoliation acid in so that my skin is not irritated but still allows it to slough off the dead layer of cells.</li>
      <li>but I wanted something more natural.</li>
      <li>THEN I got my BUST magazine in the mail and saw a very positive review of the Blissoma face mask.  </li>
      <li>Great product even for dry skin, all natural and works well!</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>I can put my make up on right away after using this Serum since it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue.</li>
      <li>I tested it out by using it on the right side of my face twice a day for two weeks.</li>
      <li>My right side still looked like a battleground, even though I was using Blissoma twice as often for three times as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Some acne products often give me that kind of reaction and I am still willing to use them to prevent&amp;clear my occasional acne</li>
      <li>As icing on the cake, their products are very reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s natural is a huge plus for me.</li>
      <li>I really love this moisturizer for several reasons; 1) It moisturizes without being tacky, sticky or greasy.</li>
      <li>but it was making red bumps to spread even more on my face.</li>
      <li>and the packaging is done very well in a timely matter, i ordered it and it was here in time for the holidays!</li>
      <li>Blissoma Solutions natural skincare Smooth A+ Organic Moisture Serum for eczema.  </li>
      <li>it helped me a lot and really does work!</li>
      <li>Humanely produced and the originator of the product is super friendly; we&#x27;ve had several emails between us.</li>
      <li>Love this product and going to use it probably for a long time.</li>
      <li>I have roseacea skin that is super sensitive.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I  bought this item for my son.  I thought that a natural product would be good.  But when my son tried it he said it just worked so so.</li>
    <li> Praise for this product; as well as the whole line of Blissoma skin creams.   They all smell wonderful; absorb purely and cleanly.   Humanely produced and the originator of the product is super friendly; we&#x27;ve had several emails between us. Great customer service.   I wonder how adding sunscreen would be? Just a thought.   But for now, great praise to Blissoma. : )</li>
    <li> Blissoma Solutions natural skincare Smooth A+ Organic Moisture Serum for eczema.  This is a great product worked on my Eczema</li>
    <li> I have rosacea but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this product. Why you ask? Well let&#x27;s count all the 2 line reviews posted on December 19, 2011 by reviewers who all think it&#x27;s great how organic the product is and who don&#x27;t have any other reviews. This is a clear sign this company hired a marketing/promotion company to pump up the reviews of this product. Even if the other reviews are true that alone is enough to make me steer clear of this product and this company.</li>
    <li> About 5 weeks prior to my wedding I got the most horrendous breakout completely out of nowhere...I spent $88 on dermatological products and watched as the skin situation got worse and worse.  THEN I got my BUST magazine in the mail and saw a very positive review of the Blissoma face mask.  Completely desperate, I ordered it and watched in amazement as my face cleared up within a week.  I ordered this A+ serum to continue to keep my skin in check.  It is liquid magic in a bottle.  My skin looks ridiculously even and clear.  Even the scars from the breakout a few weeks ago are GONE.  And usually they take months to disappear! I will never use another skin line again-- Blissoma is my one and only!! Seriously, I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and everything else she makes.  A+++</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0036YTW2E Blissoma Solutions skincare Smooth A+ Moisture Serum for acne and irritated skin, 1 Oz, 30 ml]]  Finally! Organic skin care that smells great and works wonderful too. I absolutely love Smooth. I have combination skin but I am getting older and drier in places. I still have the occasional painful breakout acne, and Smooth has remedied this injustice for me. I use it as an all over treatment and as a spot treatment as Blissoma suggests and I find that it truly helps my skin look and as the name suggests SMOOTH.</li>
    <li> i tried the serum and my skin cleared up so fast and also got softer.love this product.i have to have this product in my home at all times now.</li>
    <li> This seems perfect for me! I have redness/sensitive skin and the occasional breakout. The reviews are very helpful. The fact that it&#x27;s natural is a huge plus for me. Can&#x27;t wait!!</li>
    <li> Tried this product from my friend. What I like most about it is that it&#x27;s organic and not too pricey. Works great too.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. and the packaging is done very well in a timely matter, i ordered it and it was here in time for the holidays!</li>
    <li> I have used Blissoma&#x27;s Smooth A+ Moisture Serum all winter while battling dry skin and acne flare-ups, and it has really done wonders. I love the texture of it (it has a nice slip to it), and how truly moisturizing it is, how it sinks into my skin. I use it every morning after cleaning my face with water, applying toner, then a light application of jojoba oil over extra dry spots, then this product all over my face. It creates a great smooth layer before applying mineral makeup. I find the scent soothing (it smells like the natural ingredients it&#x27;s made of, rather than added fragrance). I found it a bit heavy for my combination skin during the summer, but in the cooler drier months, I wouldn&#x27;t be without this. Of the 5 Blissoma products I&#x27;ve used, this is the one I will be repurchasing many times more.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid forties and have fair, oily/combination, acneic skin. I really love this moisturizer for several reasons; 1) It moisturizes without being tacky, sticky or greasy. 2) The ingredients seem to agree with my skin in that it does not cause breakouts and actually seems to keep pimples to a minimum. 3) It leaves my skin feeling velvety and dewing looking. 4) It smells quite nice to me. My only actual gripe is the price per ounce. I think this product should sell at 2oz for the same price (so one star off for price). I have been using this in conjunction with Artisan Naturals Aloe &amp; Zinc Acne Serum (as a spot treatment).</li>
    <li> Ever since switching to Blissoma skincare products my skin has been clear of acne finally! After researching ingredients in skincare and cosmetics and trying to find a line with the best natural and organic ingredients, I came across Blissoma. This moisturizer smells great and is the perfect texture and consistency, and I feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin everytime I put it on.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything close to what it claims. Actually it did the opposite for my skin.  It made my face itchy and caused mild rashes. Some acne products often give me that kind of reaction and I am still willing to use them to prevent&amp;clear my occasional acne so I used this product almost the half of it hoping maybe it would get better but the more I used it the crappier my skin became.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! My only complaint is the smell. It&#x27;s pretty strong. I couldn&#x27;t handle it all over my face, so I spot use over blemishes. My regular acne treatment leaves my blemishes red and dry, a touch of serum and the redness and dryness and blemishes are gone!</li>
    <li> My face has NEVER looked better!!. My skin tone is amazing. I haven&#x27;t had any problem with breakouts and over drying. As a 45 y/o menopausal woman this is the best facial product on the market.  The fact that it&#x27;s good for you and is environmental friendly is a plus. I use this with the Rice Cleaner and Adaptive Energy Tonique.</li>
    <li> I just received yesterday and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out last night! I got many acne on my face and they are so irritating! This product smells like herbs and natural ingredient. After I put this on after toning my face, it amazingly absurd within like 3-4 seconds! And it is not greasy at all!&lt;br /&gt;I wake up the other day and my acne are not red anymore! It shirked the size and my skin feel great!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND I WILL PURCHASE IT AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I have eczema and skin feels amazing!! I haven&#x27;t had any problem with having dry skin after putting it on.I would recommend this to anybody with eczema and who feels like they cant find any product to help them!!</li>
    <li> cool product. yea its cool. I dont really know cause I have never used it before I just want a free sample.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I can&#x27;t wait to put it on my skin every day.  I think it smells delicious and herbal, though my boyfriend says I smell like a hippie.  Either way it has improved my skin issues in less than a week.</li>
    <li> I try to choose products that do not test on animals and contain mostly natural products. Blissoma not only meets my criteria, but actually works on my older, troubled skin and I just love it.  As icing on the cake, their products are very reasonably priced.  Who can ask for more?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural beauty blogger, so I test lots and lots of products - many of which either aren&#x27;t natural/healthy enough for my standards, or are sky-high in price. But Blissoma - and specifically this product, the Smooth A+ Moisture Serum - is definitely a keeper. It&#x27;s effective, affordable, and most importantly, totally free of harmful ingredients. It provides just the perfect amount of moisture for my combination skin, it&#x27;s a great base layer for mineral makeup, and it soothes redness and irritation. Plus, a little bit goes a long way, so it lasts a long time - SO worth the $17.99 price!</li>
    <li> I have roseacea skin that is super sensitive.  This said it was ok for that  I put it on once and my face swelled up and I got acne all over within an hour  It may be a fine product, but not for roseacea.  On the up side the seller decided to take it back from me, even after use, minus a processing fee.  I sent it back on Tuesday, so we will see what my refund is.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to skincare product in the summer. Keeps my skin clear!</li>
    <li> THis is a great product!!!!  It is light and has a good exfoliation acid in so that my skin is not irritated but still allows it to slough off the dead layer of cells. It smells good too, so all day I have that, just stepped out of a facial smell!!!</li>
    <li> Great product even for dry skin, all natural and works well! I have less redness in the mornings now.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers have stated, Blissoma products are scrupulously free of questionable ingredients.  And the A+ Moisture Serum is wonderful stuff.  My skin is getting drier, but I&#x27;ve been battling inflammatory, cystic acne due to hormone imbalances.  Lovely, huh?  This serum is not drying, unlike most products for acne, yet it is effective.  Especially because this product is designed to counteract inflammation; it reduces the swelling and allows my skin to clear and heal.  And the niacinamide is a great ingredient that not only helps with breakouts, but also can help prevent and lessen wrinkles.  Since I&#x27;m starting to get those unwelcome fine little lines, quite a plus!    I&#x27;ve used three bottles of this stuff and am ordering more today.  Not everything works for everyone I know, but really, if you have inflammation problems (eczema, etc.) or acne, I would give this stuff a try.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely great stuff!! I&#x27;ve suffered from rosacea for over 15 years and this is the ONLY moisturizer that has worked on a consistent basis in all that time.  It adds moisture in the areas that need it but doesn&#x27;t leave my oiler areas (Hello, T-Zone!)shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly and will continue to purchase on a regular basis-hope to never run out!!</li>
    <li> A great, lightweight moisturizer for oily or blemished skin. Works wonderfully for me. A little bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Wow.. amazing product. Used this solution for my eczema and works great. Transaction went smoothly as well, would buy again. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after reading all of the other reviews and decided to try it out. At the age of 31, I&#x27;ve been battling with adult acne for over 7 years! I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, AcneFree, and other systems and they just irritated my skin. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks now since I&#x27;ve been using your products and i LOVE it!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> very happy with this product. works great, completley organic. i&#x27;m totally satisfied. will continue to use and recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> this product is really good. it helped me a lot and really does work! i would recommend it to anybody who is looking</li>
    <li> This moisturizer just makes my skin happy.  It has the right balance of moisturizers to deeply nourish my face and the right mix of botanicals to keep it from being sensitive and acne prone.  I live in a dry climate and have struggled with finding a moisturizer that could keep my skin from being thirsty without being greasy or oily.  Since I&#x27;ve started using it, I&#x27;ve had almost no breakouts and no eczema (which I&#x27;d sometimes get before). I love the eco-footprint of the line, and for a nice moisturizer the price is affordable. I love all the natural ingredients too - no weird chemicals!</li>
    <li> Blissoma Solutions natural skincare Smooth A+ Organic Moisture Serum keeps my face feeling softly moisturized with the added benefit of reducing my once monthly breakouts.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I have always had skin problems and this has worked wonders for me! I highly recommend anyone with skin issues to try this out</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, and she is not happy with the product. it&#x27;s not working at all. in the end, she still have so many acne.</li>
    <li> I had issues with Rosacea and nothing would help me for the last two years. I tried a lot of different stuff for sensitive skin but it was making red bumps to spread even more on my face. I almost gave up. Decided to give it a try to this one because after reading a review of a client with Rosacea. It was miracle, after using it for the first week immediately noticed improvement and now no more red bumps, my skin is glowing like nothing ever happened before. I can put my make up on right away after using this Serum since it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue. One more thing I&#x27;ve noticed is my fine wrinkles started disappearing. Love this product and going to use it probably for a long time.</li>
    <li> I live outside US so I purchase when I travel. Product do wonders to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;And thanks for sending me a small simple. Loved it.</li>
    <li> After stopping the Pill, my face went CRAZY! So oily and acne everywhere. I never had a skin issue until now. Tried a few things but I wanted something more natural. After reading the reviews, I decided to try Smooth A+. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks and my face is 90% back to normal. Sooooooo very happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a trial sample, and I will be purchasing the full size. Recently, I was told I have rosacea, and I began using this product. My skin is smoother, my red bumps have decreased, and my redness has gone down. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> This product is horrible for rosacea prone skin and really irritates the sensitive skin. It is not even a good moisturizer, it cakes up and stays as a horrible grey film on your skin.</li>
    <li> I have combination acneic skin with eczema. Killer combo, right? Thought this would be the perfect product after reading the description and reviews. I tested it out by using it on the right side of my face twice a day for two weeks. It was just a tad less red than the left side, but no reduction in bumps. I finally went to a dermatologist and she prescribed adapalene cream ($10 after insurance), which I used on the left side once a night for one week. After one week, my left side was flat and smooth (still a little red). My right side still looked like a battleground, even though I was using Blissoma twice as often for three times as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for ease of use, it&#x27;s hard to get less than a pump out for spot-treating. Otherwise, it goes on smoothly and smells like the stuff that&#x27;s used for facials at botanical spas. Just looking at the ingredients, I highly doubt this will make your skin worse, and it&#x27;s certainly possible it will improve your skin. Then again, it&#x27;s also possible it will do nothing at all.</li>
    <li> Pretty much every single review on here claims that this is a miracle product but it has not improved my skin in any way. I still break out and my skin doesnt look any brighter or smoother. I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I bought it along with the Restore Deep moisture serum and I use this during the day as well as at night. During the day I mix it in with my moisturizer. Its not too greasy or heavy and has a great smell. Im addicted! Def buying more.</li>
    <li> THIS HAS WORKED WONDERFULLY FOR ME.I HAVE REALLY RED CHEEKS DUE TO ROSACEA AND I USE THIS EVERY DAY AND IT  DRAMATICALLY REDUCES THE REDNESS.I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I JUST WISH IT COST LESS SO I COULD BUY IT MORE.</li>
