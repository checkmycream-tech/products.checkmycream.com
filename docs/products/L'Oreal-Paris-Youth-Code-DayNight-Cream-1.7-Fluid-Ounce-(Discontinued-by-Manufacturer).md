<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite facial moisturizer. It is very light weight &amp; totally non greasy feeling. Goes on very smoothly and has nice clean smell, also has no SPF which can irritate your eyes. Makes your skin silky smooth. It&#x27;s like a big drink of water for your face. It&#x27;s getting almost impossible to find now, that&#x27;s why I ordered on Amazon. L&#x27;Oreal has either discontinued the product or changed the packaging to the point where I don&#x27;t recognize it anymore. The small containers offered by this vendor are a perfect size for travelling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28, and even though I&#x27;ve got good genes, I was starting to recognize more pronounced crow&#x27;s feet, diminished glow and faint laugh lines. I saw the Youth Code bundle at a local retailer, and thought it might be worth the shot. Holy smokes. I literally saw overnight changes. After using the products for a day, my skin seemed softer, more resilient and had a noticeable glow. My laugh lines disappeared, and my crow&#x27;s feet are way less noticeable. I feel like I stepped into a time machine that transported my skin back to its pre-children status. I love this stuff! And I love ordering it on Amazon instead of purchasing at the store – it&#x27;s a couple bucks cheaper online!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I&#x27;m 44, no wrinkles but some clear definition of parentheses around my mouth and thinning of fatty tissue under my eyes, i have typically oily skin but it can easily switch to dry with a lack of moisture in the air. (Fall into winter). I am caucasion with fair skin. I am also prone to hormonal and dry skin breakouts mainly around my chin &amp; jawline. All that said, this cream has all but eliminated the parentheses  around my mouth and has even plumped up my tear tracks without causing swelling or puffiness. My skin broke out the first week but since cleared up and is glowing without being oily. My skin is tighter, firmer and  younger looking. The first week my husband &amp; i  joked that its \\&quot;youth code\\&quot; claims worked too well, bringing me back to puberty with the breakouts but happly that phase is over.  My mom noticed the difference in my parentheses  and asked what i was using, she notices everything (critically) but this time in a great way. I would absolutely recommend this cream. The fragrance is light and pleasant as is the texture and spreadability. I would love to try the eye cream but it&#x27;s hard enough affording this cream. (Maybe for Christmas!)</li>
    <li> I am finding all of the L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code products to be quite nice including the day/night cream.  This cream has a nice consistency, neither heavy nor light, and is just right for my combination/dry skin. I&#x27;m using it only at night since I use a cream with an SPF factor for daytime.  I use this cream over the regenerating youth care serum.  My skin feels soft and looks great when I wake up in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for few days and I have started having breakouts all over my face.It has not given me any results as it claims.Do not buy this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a great product. I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s with very sensitive skin that&#x27;s combination that still breaks out from time to time. I have noticed a significant difference in the overall tone and texture of my skin from using this line. The lotion is very light but does a great job moisturizing right where I need it. It&#x27;s not greasy and my skin never feels tight afterwards which means it&#x27;s doing its job. I purchased the whole product line and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and I just love it!</li>
    <li> It is a thicker cream (which I like).  It does&#x27;t irritate my skin and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  Better than some of the expensive products I use.</li>
    <li> I rarely have any pimples but this cream made me break out.I assume because it clogs pores.It also stings a little, right after you apply it.</li>
    <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Day/ Night Cream is fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Youth Code for about 3 years in the past. I was &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; diagnosed with PCOS and stopped using a lot of cosmetic items in an attempt to detox my entire body, skin included, with hopes to restore my body&#x27;s natural balance (I was extremely oily and was not sure if anything I was using was contributing to the excess oils). Eventually the PCOS diagnosis was wrong so I went back to using Youth Code and although the product and package in terms of size seemed to have shrunk since the last time I used it, its just as amazing as it was the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using it my face was pretty dry and dull, after using it again, my skin is soft, moist and overall healthier looking. Some age spots are starting to lighten too. I apply it to my face and neck twice daily after showering and thoroughly cleaning my face. Youth Code does not have a strong odor and is not greasy. I have included the ingredients below for those who are curious:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients  Water; Glycerin; Isohexadecane; Cyclohexasiloxane; Dimethicone; Alcohol Denat.; Dipropylene Glycol; Synthetic Wax; PEG-10 Dimethicone; Dimethicone/PEG-10/15 Crosspolymer; Dimethicone/Polyglycerin-3 Crosspolymer; Caffeine; Sodium Acrylates Copolymer; Sodium Hydroxide; Bifida Ferment Lysate; Adenosine; Ascorbyl Glucoside; Nylon-12; Limonene; Disodium EDTA; Propylene Carbonate; Hydroxyethylpiperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid; Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride; Disteardimonium Hectorite; Ethylhexyl Glycerin; Polysilicone-8; Tocopheryl Acetate; Methylparaben; Phenoxyethanol; Fragrance; Sodium Benzoate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results, keep in mind everyone is different:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately: Skin is smoother, deeply hydrated. Wrinkle reduction begins.&lt;br /&gt;After 1 Week: Signs of stress and fatigue are visibly diminished. Skin looks rested.&lt;br /&gt;After 1 Month: Lines and wrinkles are visibly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Youth Code is what you need if you are looking for a light, smooth and velvety soft finish on your skin with less visible signs of aging.d if you are looking for a light, smooth and velvety soft finish on your skin with less visible signs of aging.</li>
    <li> I received a deluxe sample of  L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code for free as a member of Smiley360. It is a great cream, light and silky with a pleasant scent that is not overpowering. It is a day and night cream in one so no need for extra product purchases.  I did not give it 5 stars because of the price, however, taking into consideration the dual use (day/night cream) of the product as well as the brand being a drug store brand (you&#x27;d be able to bargain shop with coupons), I must say that I would recommend this product and buy it for myself.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the Loreal Youth Code from Smiley 360.  As instructed, I started using the product morning and evening and after about three days I could feel my skin was softer, sleeker and my face looked brighter.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested in renewing natural beauty of the face.  I am a 45 y/o who is just now getting concerned about all the damage sun and tanning has done to my skin.  This product really makes a difference quickly.</li>
    <li> I had received a free sample from Smiley360 and this product is the bomb (in a good way).  I love how it absorbed into my skin with no greasy feeling.  The Youth Code is light and creamy.  All pro&#x27;s and no con&#x27;s.  You should give this product a try, I know you will love it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code(tm) Day/Night Cream from Smiley360, &amp; It works pretty good. Makes my skin feel smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. I noticed my skin looked &amp; felt silky after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample (a jar)of loreal youth code day/night cream from smiley360. I had never tried it before, but Im hooked now. Its very creamy and thick. But absorbs quickly and keeps your skin feeling moisturzed and soft. I ve been using it for a few days now, and love it. I definatly reccommend it to anyone whos looking for a new day/night cream.</li>
    <li> Loreal Paris Youth Code Day/Night Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So my latest Smiley360 mission is for the Loreal Paris Youth Code Day/Night Cream.  I&#x27;ve always been a little bit sceptical when it comes to products that say they can improve my skin in just one application but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try anyway.  After one week all I can say is that I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial thoughts upon receiving my sample product were that I don&#x27;t really care much for the smell and I was really worried when I applied it because it is pretty thick.  I could just picture my face breaking out like crazy from the heavy product clogging my pores when the weather just turned warm enough here to make me sweat on a regular basis.  But I did it anyway...seven days, seven applications (I know it says to apply it twice a day but I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t have enough to do the whole week applying twice a day).  Lo and behold there is enough here for atleast another week so I will continue to use it and see if I get any other results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thickness was also a concern for me because I can&#x27;t stand to feel anything on my face.  I was amazed that the Loreal Youth Code absorbed very quickly and the only time I noticed it was if I actually put my hand on my face and then I could feel it then but it wasn&#x27;t a greasy feeling it was just a slightly tacky feeling.  After an hour or so I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had applied it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so now on to my results:  Day 2 of my experience I looked at the area right below my eyes.  I have some very fine lines (quite a few of them) that make my skin appear a little bit darker there and give me the whole bags under the eyes look.  I didn&#x27;t see a difference in the lines themselves but I did notice that the bags under my eyes look had pretty much disappeared.  My whole face already looked more refreshed.  I also liked how smooth my face felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5 was when I really noticed that the fine lines were getting less noticeable to me.  I mean they were still there but they weren&#x27;t the first thing I noticed when I looked at my face anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 7 is today and I must say that I am very happy with the fact that my fine lines under my eyes are improving (not gone, but who knows after another week).  I am still impressed that I haven&#x27;t had issues with greasy skin or breakouts after applying this all week (this alone almost makes it worth buying).  My face overall is more fresh and more revived looking.  But I still don&#x27;t really care for the smell.  Now if it could just get rid of those expression lines on my forehead....that would be a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I recieved this trial size product for free from Smiley360 but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am a member of Smiley360, an online community of consumers who love trying new brands for free and sharing their authentic opinions and feedback with friends.

Some of the fine lines are less visible too after just a couple of weeks using it!!</li>
    <li> After hearing amazing things about youth code products i had an opportunity to try this cream for free from a smiley360.com offer. Overall i really like it.  It has a pleasant smell and it tingles upon application which made me feel like it was working. It was a little thick so i felt like i had to use a lot, but it wasn&#x27;t overly greasy. I&#x27;d definitely try it again in the future.</li>
    <li> good moisturizer. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading just about everywhere that it&#x27;s a dupe for Lancome&#x27;s Genifique (which I normally use). I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to actually BE on par with Genifique, but because of the rave reviews it has received, I was very curious and willing to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was that since using this product I became prone to breakouts (I wash every morning and night, religiously, and have made no changes in my skincare routine or diet, with the exception of changing my Genifique for THIS product). Prior to its use, I was not an acne-prone person, so this side-effect was frustrating, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, upon first use, I felt a tingling sensation on my skin which progressed to a burning sensation after about a week of use, at which time I chose to stop using it altogether (and for the record, I always applied it AFTER cleansing with a Clairsonic brush and using a toner). I am also NOT prone to skin sensitivity, and yet this product irritated my skin from mild to OUCH, pretty darn quickly. So, I&#x27;m officially going back to my Genifique products and throwing Youth Code in the garbage.</li>
    <li> This is a very light cream, not greasy and has a very pleasant and  soft fragrance.  I have normal to oil skin so it is good enough for me.  I use it under make up in the morning and also at night before bed.  Since I am also using the Hyaluronic Acid, I can&#x27;t tell if it would work just as good on it&#x27;s own.  I also ordered the night cream and will give it a try after this.  I like Youth code brand products.</li>
    <li> Love this product very good price too</li>
    <li> I liked this product very well. Excellent product, I will suggest to my friends strongly. After using this cream, most of patches got vanished on my face.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well on my skin because I have sensitive skin.  My face will turn red after applied.  The lotion is not enough moisturize especially at night time.</li>
    <li> Drenches my skin with moisture without leaving me greasy looking, and plumps any tightness and fine lines right up!</li>
    <li> I really love this effective product and it helps me with my skincare routine.  Along with this, I use the Serum Intense, Day Lotion and Eye Cream in addition to exfoliating three times a week.  This product is expensive, but a lot less when purchased from Amazon.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone wishing to improve and maintain their appearance.</li>
    <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal products for years. I&#x27;m the kind of person who will spring for a few high-end skin care products if I like them and will stick with them unless they change formulas or stop producing them. That said, I have found that most moisturizers are pretty much the same whether you spend big $$ or not. This is one of the lower-priced moisturizers I&#x27;ve found that works really well for my skin and I LOVE IT. I think they&#x27;ve changed formulations, but I STILL love it. I don&#x27;t have overly-sensitive skin, nor am I prone to break-outs. In fact, I tend to be more dry. That said, this soaks into my skin quickly (sometimes too quickly) and I have to use a bit more in the wintertime. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. It moisturizes without overdoing it. I can&#x27;t ask for anything more than that. It has a strong, yet very pleasant scent (imo). I will use this until it&#x27;s no longer suitable for my skin, and then move on to the next one, for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin ;O)</li>
    <li> This stuff works! skin glows and is soft after using it. Not sticky at all. Very smooth and even your finger tips gets soft. Very nice. Been using this for 1 year.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0047F71SS L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Day/Night Cream, 1.6-Fluid Ounce]]love this product. wish i could find it even cheaper! shipped fast, as always.  arrived very fresh and new.</li>
    <li> I am a 31 year old mother of 4 and need a good day/night cream especially since I know my skin looks tired after running raged all day. I am prone to break outs and have kind of sensitive skin. And this worked great my skin had less fine wrinkles and looked rejuvinated and younger looking and not tired. I recommend trying this product it works just like it says it does. I did receive a free sample bottle of this to try and all opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> I received a free deluxe sample from smiley360.com and wow! I am impressed.  I am 34 and have sensitive skin... I am picky on my skincare products... I want it to soak deep into my skin but not irritate and not feeling like I am wearing a thick layer over my skin.  This is it!  quickly absorbs into your skin and it literally feels as soft as baby skin!  I am in the sun a lot and have already been seeing slight improvement.  My skin just looks healthy and the wonderful thing is I don&#x27;t worry if I go out to the store without makeup! (seriously!) I know it can be pricey... but it is a go staple that will replace some more expensive brands that I buy online!  Try it for yourself!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I use it for the bags under my eyes and after only using it for a short time I can already see a difference! I received a free sample of this product from smiley360.com. I recommend that everyone check them out! Again, I really like this product. The scent is very pleasant and it does not leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this one but I decided to try it and it is really amazing.My skin is smooth and you can see the difference.So happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> I recieved a free sample of the product and have been impressed with the initial results. With the first two applications (overnight and the following morning) I did notice my skin seemed softer and a little smoother. I&#x27;m pleased that it feels light enough on my face to use as a daily mostiurizer before I put my makeup on and does have spf protection (a must in my opinion for any face product). I&#x27;m excited to see the results after a week or more of use.</li>
    <li> I have always used Olay products and have had great experiences with them. I recently was offered a free sample of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code from Smiley360.com, so of course I was willing to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was pleasant and not overwhelming, and I loved the feel of it on my skin. It was soft and went on smoothly, being quickly absorbed, but not leaving my skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for less than a week, but already can tell that my skin just looks brighter and healthier.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product.I really loved this product. It make my face feel great and the skin feel soft. I noticed and improvement in the look of my skin.</li>
    <li> i LOVED THIS PRODUCT. IT LEFT MY SKIN FEELING SMOOTH AND SILKY. I WAS VERY SUPRISED IT WORKED THE WAY IT DID. i WOULD DEFINATLEY PURCHASE MORE, IT IS A LITTLE ON THE HIGH SIDE PRICE WISE, BUT IT&#x27;S WELL WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> I received a Free sample of this from Smiley360 and I have been using it for about a week.  It goes on thick and gives the impression it absorbs right into your skin.  I wish it had some sunscreen as I then have to add the addition of my other moisturizer to get some protection, especially in the summer months.  I plan on using this up and buying another jar!!  Great product and lok forward to getting younger skin</li>
    <li> I got very lucky that Smiley360 sent me a free sample of L&#x27;Oreal Youth code Day/ Night Cream.A little dab is all you need to make your skin look young and healthy. I put a small amount of the cream on my forehead, my cheeks and one on my chin.With upward strokes I  let it penetrate my skin.I put a little bit on my neck too  and let the skin absorb it by rubbing it in with again gentle upwards strokes. Within couple days only I could see the difference only in couple days in how my skin looked and how it felt. Not only my skin had a soft and supple feeling but it was glowing too(Stress was making my skin look dull). This cream has an extremely mild fragrance , nothing overpowering and it is non greasy too .Try it because you are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Smiley360 for my free test product sample of awesome L&#x27;oreal Youth code day/night cream that was shipped to my door.I would definitely recommend this product to my friends/family to try it.</li>
    <li> I recieved a free sample of this day/night cream and I really liked it. It hydrated my skin, but didn&#x27;t make it oily. I would definitely buy it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from Smiley360 and after a week of trying it, I can honestly say I&#x27;m very impressed! After just the first 7 days I&#x27;ve noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t feel so tight after washing, feels softer and my skin just looks hydrated and lovely! I will definitely switch to Youth Code from my usual day and night creams when my sample runs out!</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;* This is a great moisturizer that makes my face feel fresh!&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t make my skin look oily which is great as I have a mixed type skin and it&#x27;s hard to find a balance and avoid creams that make my skin dry or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neutral:&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;m not sure if the cream works.. My face hasn&#x27;t changed one bit after using the cream for 6 months. Which is good on one side - I haven&#x27;t aged, but bad because existing wrinkels haven&#x27;t changed either. In contrast, RevitaLift cream showed significant improvements on my face right away although it&#x27;s recommended for much older woment than me, in my 20s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will likely to buy again!</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old and couple of years ago I started to get fine lines on my forehead. I wasted a lot of money on famous brands anti-wrinkles and they gave me an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; result. I tried this cream and it&#x27;s result was better than my expensive creams(I can say it reduced my forehead lines by 70% while my expensive creams could reduce them by 50%) . I don&#x27;t say it was perfect, but considering that it gave me better result for much less money I really like it and give it 5stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I used Lancomb renerge for years and this makes them look like idiots! It is soooo much cheaper and works a thousand times better! I am suggesting this to all my friends and family!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this from Smiley360! I am all about keeping my skin moisturized, and always enjoy the chance to try a new product.  I absolutely loved L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Youth Code.  It hydrates well without making my skin feel oily or heavy.  I can tell a difference in my skin, it&#x27;s firmer, and more youthful looking.</li>
    <li> I am a 37 year old woman with combination skin that tends to breakout. Finding lotions and creams that work for my skin without causing blemishes is a nightmare. I received a full size bottle from L&#x27;Oreal through their marketing campaign on Smiley360.com. I wasn&#x27;t sure about it but figured I&#x27;d try it for free.  By day 2, I was already in love. This lotion makes my skin feel smooth and energized. It&#x27;s delicate and hasn&#x27;t caused any negative effects. I&#x27;m even going without any makeup because my skin just looks so much healthier!</li>
    <li> I received this product free to test out and review. I have been using it for a week and really haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin tone. I do have to say that it does not go on greasy and does have a good fragrance to it. I will continue using the product and if anything changes, I will come back and update my review!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code from Smiley360.  I&#x27;ve used this product for about a week and am very impressed with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always worried about skin irritation - not with this product - and the best part is, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this product!</li>
    <li> I used the product and it made my skin look and feel great. I&#x27;m  going to keep using this to keep my skin looking younger</li>
    <li> So I received a sample of this from Smiley360 for free and was super excited. I haven&#x27;t used many night creams, but with my age creeping up on me I decided its better late than never. I used this both day and night, paired with sunscreen for day use. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is much smoother and looks brighter. It has a great smell so I didn&#x27;t gag when I put it on. There are some creams that just reek so this was a welcomed surprise. I think the best thing for me is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like a chore putting it on. Its super rich, creamy, and it goes on so smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy either which is a huge plus! I know its on the more expensive end, but I totally recommend splurging on this, your skin will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: Per FTC requirements I am stating that I received a sample to review. I received no further compensation and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I am horribly picky about anything that goes on my face. I don&#x27;t like sticky, heavy, or greasy products on my face. So I was reluctant to try this out, but I am a big girl and I need all of the help I can get with my aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time that I applied this cream I was impressed. It was not heavy or greasy and it only required a teeny amount of product to cover my face. That made me happy since the jar is not very big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of use, I did not notice any miracles happen with my wrinkles or dark spots, but I did notice a significant change in the moisture of my skin. My face was not dry and flaky in the T-zone like normal, and I had a light glow. My face was not oily, but it was definitely getting a little healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a miracle worker, this is not going to be the right product. If you are looking for a light moisturizer that will \\&quot;reduce\\&quot; the look of your wrinkles, then this may be the right product for you. It is working for me so far, and I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a free full size jar of this product from Smiley360 but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> When I first applied it, there was no greasy feeling and it instantly absorbed, and it made my skin tighter and more brighter.</li>
    <li> My face looked and felt like there was something sticky on my skin. It seemed to make each pore larger, and just felt like Goo had been applied. Didn&#x27;t have the feeling that it had sunk in or had been absorbed. In the future I will stick with Clinique products.</li>
    <li> I very much like the feel of this cream.  I have used it for about 5 weeks and can&#x27;t say I see any less wrinkles but I&#x27;ll keep trying.  The price was right on Amazon -- more money in the store.</li>
    <li> This is the only face cream that leaves my face feeling young, glowing and most important NOT greasy. Love it! My face CRAVES it!</li>
    <li> Cannot change my review to THREE stars. After a month I&#x27;m not that impressed. Another reviewer aptly pointed out that Lancome owns L&#x27;Oreal, and they often put out similar products. That said the serum in combination with the day/night cream IS NOT as effective as Genefique. The one advantage Genefique has is that it is as light as a feather and can be used on enlarged pores and sensitive skin but the price (98.00) is simply out of reach for most.    Youth Code is NOT as effective as Resolution refill either which I have found to literally erase wrinkles. Granted I&#x27;m over 30, nearly wrinkle free as it is and have always worn sunscreen so I have minimal signs of any ageing. My forehead and frown line is the one concern and Lancome resolution smooths it 100%. L&#x27;oreal now discontinued decease/collagen refill was a great, cheaper version, almost as effective and youth code now takes it&#x27;s place but is not as effective.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this and loved it so I bought the full-size jar. It is very moisturizing, which I need for my dry skin. For the first 2 weeks or so I loved it but I started getting dry circles on my jawline. I&#x27;m not sure what happened because it felt really moisturizing but when I switched back to my regular cream, the circles disappeared, so I can only blame that on this product. I wish it hadn&#x27;t happened because I loved the texture and light scent!</li>
    <li> I love this item. works great. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice moisturizer with a great price.</li>
    <li> I will be returning this product.  It is highly perfumed.  I can not believe it is dermatologist tested with such a heavy fragrance.  I am allergic to heavy perfumes and I had to wash several times to remove the perfume smell.  Why the need to perfume it?????</li>
    <li> Didnt work as expected</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old and am showing signs of aging. Something I am not looking forward to and will fight all the way. I tried L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Day/Night Cream and have been using it for a while now. I have noticed that my face feels softer, tighter and alive. People are starting to think I look younger than my age and want to know what I am using. I am very happy with it. Its very easy to apply and makes your skin feel like its pampered.  I received the sample for FREE from SMILEY</li>
    <li> I received a FREE sample from Smiley360, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Just after once use of this product my skin felt soft, less red, and more bright. I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product, a little went a long ways, which I loved. I have used the whole container since I received the product and have since bought a jar of the product. After a week of using the product I have seen a huge improvement since day one. My skin is healthy looking, it&#x27;s less puffy, and it almost glows. I have even got my husband using the product for his skin problems. His skin is soft to the touch and his skin looks younger.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try this product for free by smiley360.  Having said that, I LOVE this cream.  I have very sensitive skin yet if something is too heavy my pores just sweat it off.  Well I use a small amount on my finger tips and dot over my face and blend upwards.  The repeat for my neck.  This goes on so easily and instantly you feel your skin become revitalized, much like a plant that is wilting and gets water and suddenly springs back.  I have not used this long enough to comment on how it works on fine lines, but I will say when I use it my skin instantly feels better.  I love sea glass hunt and no matter how well I moisturized before, when I get home my face needs a little re hydration, and this is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely pay full price when my jar runs out.</li>
    <li> I received this product in the mail for a free trial through smiley360. I&#x27;m using this to help keep my skin young and fresh. So far I&#x27;ve not gotten any wrinkles since using Youth Code. It does leave my face feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. I have some acne scaring and dark spots as well, so far I&#x27;m not seeing any results but I&#x27;m going to give to more time.</li>
    <li> First, I have to laugh at the reviews of \\&quot;heavy perfumed\\&quot; and \\&quot;I had breakouts\\&quot;  let&#x27;s be real - you are very sensitive to smells, obviously, because this is no way perfumey!  And anyone can have a breakout from trying a new product.  So, if this made you break out, then yes, this is not a product for your sensitive skin.  I think people w/sensitive skin should be buying \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; products only.  Makes sense, yes?  For us normal skin people - this cream is awesome!  It does what it says.  Regenerates.  I noticed a difference in two weeks.  Glowing, smooth, moist skin.  I use a little in the AM with my SPF and of course at bedtime - bedtime is the best for using your face creams as it gets to set all night.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, so it lasts a long time.  (Hint: for women to decrease wrinkles - use satin pillow cases only - also the satin does not absorb all your face creams like cotton cases.;)  I worked for a plastic surgeon and know all the prescription creams and treatments out there and you don&#x27;t have to drop hundreds of dollars.  Perfect price for a great cream.</li>
    <li> This cream feels hydrating, without being greasy. I have T-Zone oiliness and eye/cheek dryness and it does well in both areas.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I picked this up at a duty free store on a whim.  I&#x27;m 39 and have combination skin prone to clogged pores, breakouts, and blackheads.  I can honestly say that my skin has never looked or felt better since using this product.  Hope in a Jar from Philosophy is the only other product that came close, and this stuff is much more economical.  All I have to use on my skin is this, Neutrogena sensitive skin astringent, and Shiseido eye cream (don&#x27;t skimp on the eyes!).</li>
    <li> I tried this product since offered by Groupon with discounted price (around $5 less). The impression was the cool &amp; relieved feelings that I have never experienced with any other cream before. It also leaves a smooth and non-greasy touch on my skin as I expected. Its effect is also up to my desire: my skin stays bright and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product in Amazon with reasonable price and already purchased the 5th jar now. I will continue using this product when my last jar running out.</li>
    <li> First off let me start by saying I have tried numerous different facial moisturizers and tend to be a little obsessive when it comes to skin care.  I have been using this moisturizer for over a year now off and on.  It has been off and on because I like to try new and different products, and I always come back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very light and creamy.  It has not caused any oily feelings or break outs, and provides ample moisture for the day.  I tend to have very dry skin but can also get the monstrous zit here and there.  This keeps my face moisturized all day and feels wonderful on my skin.  When I use it consistently I can notice a difference as far as the fine lines around my eyes, \\&quot;crow&#x27;s feet\\&quot;, and most mornings I can notice an immediate difference in the texture of my skin.  It isn&#x27;t too heavily scented and has become my go to daily moisturizer.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially at this price on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This cream is exactly that just a cream. doesn&#x27;t do anything different to your skin. Doesn&#x27;t stay with you. As soon as you dry your face from a shower it is back to dry skin. Loreals product is nothing special and as to making your skin feel and look younger (doesn&#x27;t do it). You get the same results from any other face cream.</li>
    <li> I received a FREE sample of L&#x27;oreal youth code from smiley360 I started using it right away and what I noticed right away...&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt softer&lt;br /&gt;I looks smoother&lt;br /&gt;After a few days my skin felt tighter&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;This is my last year and my twenties and I am hoping to look great in my 30&#x27;s!!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample from Smiley360 last week. I was thrilled and used it right away before going to bed that night. It is very light and non-greasy, nearly odorless and feels quite nice! My Skin is a combination of dry and oily. My face looks smoother and fresher and feels softer after 3 days of using it.The few little lines I have are fading slightly too.Can&#x27;t wait to see what a month will do :) My routine is much easier now! I think the price is quite affordable and you can get alot from the little jar.Highly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free through Smiley360. I am a 33 year old female. My skin started to look not as youthful anymore. I tried Loreal Youth code and I have to say my skin looks much better now. I love how my skin feels after I use it. I also like the smell a lot. This lives up to the hype. It is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t need much at all. The only thing, I wish it would have SPF.</li>
    <li> I recieved a free sample and boy am I glad. The product is smooth and makes your skin feel nice and silky. I have only been using it for a short time so I dont know how it will be long term but for now I think its a winner,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fast approaching 30, and when looking in the mirror I&#x27;ve noticed the little wrinkles by my eyes and the corner of my lips. Needless to say I started freaking out! My mom who is 55 has beautiful skin and she owes it to L&#x27;Oreal. She&#x27;s used it for years. I remember her telling me to always use a good face cream in the morning before putting make up on and at night before bed. With 3 little kids and a hectic life, it&#x27;s a little hard to maintain such a strict regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks ago I received a free sample of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code thanks to Smiley360.com. The mission was simple: Try it, use it, talk about it. Well I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks, only two weeks and already I see the difference! My skin is much much smoother and not so dry anymore. I expect to see even better results in the coming weeks and months. If you have not tried this product yet, I definitely recommend that you do! It&#x27;s truly amazing how a little dab can make such a huge difference. It definitely brings to mind, \\&quot;less is more\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, as I mentioned above it is hard to maintain such a strict regimen, I knew that in order to give an honest opinion of the product I would have to make an effort to use it everyday. Using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code has definitely become a part of my daily routine. I could not have asked for a better cream or for better results! Thank you L&#x27;Oreal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure: I received one or more of the above mentioned product to facilitate my review. No other compensation has been received. All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Now that I am hitting my 30&#x27;s I have been worried about finding me something that would help keep my skin young and beautiful looking and am glad to have tried Youth Code. Ever since I have been using it which is a week after putting it on my face feels so much better,hasn&#x27;t been greasy and I have had a few friends ask what I was doing different because my face looked so much better. I was thinking it was looking and feeling better,but to hear it from others tells me this really works.&lt;br /&gt;A little about my skin:&lt;br /&gt;My skin is hard to please I can say. I have combination skin and in the dry areas it gets so dry that my skin just gets so flaky.Like I mentioned I have been using it a little over a week and I can see a change for the better especially in my dry areas of my face. Also in the oily parts my face doesn&#x27;t get really oily like it does when using other products and I have actually seen a decrease in oily and my face doesn&#x27;t get as oily as fast as it use to. After putting it on it makes my face feel so much better and younger. If you can relate to me you should really try this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Day/Night Cream and even if not you should give it a try. No need to wait until your in desperate need of a miracle for your skin and I only wish I had this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Day/Night Cream and all claims are from my own personal experience with the product. I am also a member of Smiley360</li>

Everyone head over to SMILEY360!!! and then come back here to purchase some more!! :)</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Loreal Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Day/Night cream from Smiley360.com. I applied the cream for the last 3 days. I have noticed some softening of my skin. I am a little hesitant about trying new products because my skin is very sensitive. I really love the feel of the cream, it&#x27;s a very nice feeling on my face. My skin has a light dewy look to it. I am really impressed with the quality of this product. Way to go Loreal!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample to try and have feel in love with this cream. I have switched to this and replaced my old. It does not feel heavy and greasy on my skin nor caused any reactions with my sensitive sking.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from Smiley 360 and I absolutley loved it and will be buying it soon.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product, and I used it every night for a week.  I can definitely see a difference in the smoothness of my skin!</li>
    <li> OMG I got this and used it and I absolutely love this stuff. Leaves skin feeling smooth and hydrated not greasy and love the overall appearance ya get and It does reduce the fine lines and wrinkles. Love the soft scent. Buy this product you wont be let down! Move over Olay.... Loreal youth cream has got ya beat on this! LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> This is just OK, it&#x27;s too thick for me.</li>
    <li> I have difficult skin, always have. I have tried so.. many products over the years and they either dry me out or make my face oily or make it break out. I bought this when I saw a girlfriend put it on and it instantly transformed her tired face. I use this in combination with Dermadoctor porefection serum, but when that runs out I figure I&#x27;ll try the L&#x27;Oreal Serum. I&#x27;m 30, with red hair and pale skin and I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, but this works great for me. Remember to just dab it on each cheek and forehead, then blend into skin in small circles. Do not lather it on!! Even with combination skin, my t zone has absorbed this well and my skin feels refreshed and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and I have really dry skin. I was looking for a long time for a cream that hydrates my skin and it stays for a long time like that. I think that I found my ideal cream. When I apply it on my face it really feels like doing the job and my face feels soft and tight! Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the product</li>
    <li> very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations so well that I was really very happy thank you</li>
    <li> I am a 48 year old female, and I have being using this product line for 6 months now, I have noticed my age spots much lighter, it is not even noticible,  and fine lines all have being smoothed out. I have use many other products before, this is the one I am going to continue to use. The eye cream is the only one I have found to be effective to take out dark circles and puffiness. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for. This works like a charm! It keeps my face moisturized and skin very soft. Although next time I will try the Darkspot corrector within the same line.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. For one thing it leaves your skin feeling smooth and not sticky like a lot of creams. I like the fact that it&#x27;s easy to wipe off in the morning and ready to apply a fresh coat instantly giving an all day protection, Highly recommend to lighten those wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I got this clearanced out somewhere, I like creams without spf in them and I loved this one. I have a lot of red in my cheeks and this seems to calm my skin down and leaves it moist without being greasy. I have tried many creams this has been my favorite. ..im only 28 so I cant comment too much if its good for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is great for sensitive skin as well as combination oily dry skin. I use it every day. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received a free jar of this Loreal Youth Code cream to test at home. I just love it. It has a smooth creamy texture that isn&#x27;t heavy. My skin felt softer and plumped after use. It doesn&#x27;t have a noticable scent which is really nice.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Loreal Youth Code Day/Night Cream from Smiley 360 and I am so glad that I did!  I have noticed a marked improvement already and I have only used the product for a few days.  I have oily skin so I am very cautious about what type of moisturizers that I use on my face.  This cream did not make my skin feel greasy at all.  It absorbed quickly and has made my skin feel much smoother.  I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I received this thru smiley 360 and i Love it!! after using it for a week now my skin feel so smooth and bright... it is very light not like those greasy thing :( it glided easily to your face smells so good.. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just ok. I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s not that oily although it&#x27;s cream. the only problem is that it often leaves some small white &amp;#34;residuals&amp;#34; on my face after applying, and I dont&#x27; know why.</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth the money. Not any different than using a regular moisturizer. I still have not found anything to beat Oil of Olay Regenerist.</li>
    <li> Bought this a week ago and so far so good. It doesn&#x27;t seem to break me out like other moisturizers. Will report back if something changes.</li>
    <li> Has a nice light fragrance, good absorption. Noticeably improves moisture level on skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and is currently my favorite facial moisturizer. I&#x27;m 61 and people always think I&#x27;m in my 40s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that it always bothers me to see deceptive packaging being used to try and trick us into thinking we&#x27;re getting more product than what is container, but that seems to be a standard marketing practice among manufacturers.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid forties and since using this product my skin has been tighter and there is a glow of radiance. It takes away the dull look and you come out with a fresher younger looking skin, I recommend this product very highly.</li>
    <li> I needed a fantastic day cream, something light to moisturize my face with upon awakening. This product provides light, rich moisture. I don&#x27;t feel any greasy residue after I use it. I don&#x27;t believe it has any sunscreen though so you will need to use your own or a foundation with adequate SPF coverage. My skin takes on a healthier, livelier look after I use this. There is a floral odor. It&#x27;s marketed as a day/night cream, but I feel it&#x27;s best for day. My skin needs something a little more potent while I sleep. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Received this product in packaging that looked like it was on the shelf for quite a spell, hummmm.  Tried cream on face and immediately the fragrance became unbearable, reeked so bad had to wash it off.  Could even taste it on my tongue as I breathed it in.  Couldn&#x27;t find an expiration date but believe its been around awhile.  Threw it away.  Better luck for future buyers.</li>
    <li> This is one of my absolute favorite products. I first tried it in Europe - received it as a gift set from a friend there. The set included this Youth Code 50 ml Day/Night cream and a smaller jar of Youth Code 15ml Rejuvenating Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream (I will review that one separately).  I have sensitive normal/combination skin with some areas of dryness on my cheeks, for me it is a priority to moisturize each time I wash my face and I cannot stand greasy or heavy creams. I also apply it on my face and neck before putting on makeup and I noticed that foundation goes on more smoothly as well, however, I don&#x27;t wear foundation every day and my skin still looks smooth with just the moisturizing cream. This cream is so light it absorbs easily without leaving any residue on my face or/and my pillow if used at night.  Overall I believe it could be too light for someone with very dry skin but for me it is perfect! I am now about to finish the jar and I&#x27;m getting a new one in the US - pleased to see I don&#x27;t have to go back to Europe to get this product, otherwise, I would stock up next time I&#x27;m there!</li>
    <li> I liked the product - very moisturizing - but caused bad breakouts. Grumpy that Amazon won&#x27;t take it back because it is classified as &amp;#34;flamable materials&amp;#34;. Interesting since I have returned other similar facial products that did not work...Be cautious about purchasing.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for day or night.  Just the right amount of tackiness left on the skin.  Love It.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This helped get rid of some scars on my face. I also notice dark spots fading. It works better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. Plus it smells really good.</li>
    <li> this is not realy the cream I was looking for. It feel just like a cheap cream.  but i  have been using it just for 10 days.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the product, non greasy works great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Lovely product. I primarily use it for the daily sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I got this because I like the L&#x27;oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream but it smells so bad my husband complains when I come to bed (like old lady perfume). This Youth Code cream is also called Day/Night cream, so I thought maybe it would work as well but have a better scent (reviews seemed to indicate it would smell better).  Well it does smell lots better but the cream is light and fluffy, not the rich thick cream that is Perfect Intense Nutrition. That stuff really feels like it&#x27;s doing something!  So thick I rarely put it on except just before bed (see above for how that went over with my husband). So I like this cream but it&#x27;s not ultra moisturizing. It&#x27;s only .01 ounce less than the other cream but will get used up quicker because it&#x27;s not nearly as thick, you have to use more. It works for both day and night easily. Absorbs into my skin no problem. Smells nice. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Lovely product - first time I have used it - didn&#x27;t disappoint.  Nice and smooth and not greasy. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> NOT BAD BUT DIDN&#x27;T LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t delivery as dramatic results as I had hoped, but I really like how well it moisturizes.  I&#x27;ll still continue to purchase and use, but will likely add an additional product such as retinol to help attach stubborn lines.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream, my wife loves it, I have been getting it for her for the last year and a half.</li>
    <li> My eyes and face are swollen the next morning after using it the previous night. I just used it for only once!  I have no idea what is wrong but have to stop using it and return the product back to Amazon. Of course, I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not good for my skin, i tried it for a week and broke out so badly my Dr. had to actually call the company and ask what was inside it. Results may very, but for me it was a very bad idea to try this product.</li>
    <li> Product works for me and I am very satisfied with it. Time to  re-order. I  highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 66 and so far I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, mostly under the eyes. I have been using this for a couple of years now - never used anything before - and I do notice the difference if I forget for a few days. Excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> I grew up using oil of olay &amp; used this because of price difference &amp; I must say I&#x27;m impressed..its smooth &amp; lite feeling yet has great coverage and lasts all day.  I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This has sunscreen in it.  Nice skin care crème.  Has improved softness.  The wrinkle part remains to&lt;br /&gt;been seen.</li>
    <li> Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
    <li> I have been using Youth Code for a year. I like it so much I now have my husband using it too!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code in my InStyle magazine when I was about 30.  I&#x27;ve never had clear skin; I&#x27;ve always had problems with break-outs, my whole life, no matter what products I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until that little sample came into my hands.  I used it for two days and all my skin problems cleared up.  As soon as it was gone, they were back.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years now and I get so many compliments on my complexion.  And then a few months ago, I complimented my friend on her make-up, and she said she was using the same make-up as always, but had just started using Youth Code.  When I told her that&#x27;s what I use, we both laughed.  We&#x27;ve both tried products that cost upwards of $100 and have never found anything close to as good as this.  I&#x27;m never, ever switching.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Day Cream I was a bit hesistant. It was $25 dollars and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just great marketing that made me want to buy this product, or if it actually worked. I am so glad that I did. I have had a few people say how pretty my skin looks. I have never really  been complimented on my skin and the Day Cream makes my skin look and feel younger. I am 25 years old and because of too much tanning I started having small lines on my forehead which are visibly reduced now. I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> very little of the product in the container</li>
    <li> this makes my skin so smooth and hydrated I have received compliments on how young I look! WoW!! Love It!</li>
    <li> I first used a trial kit and I have been hooked ever since, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if I ran out. My face is so smooth, I love all the YouthCode set.</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfectly moisturizing and balancing - my face always feels soft. I haven&#x27;t had a spot on since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend it to anyone and everyone</li>
    <li> I wish the jar was larger as I am going to use this daily maybe a couple times day/night. After using a variety of other brands I just think this is what my face has been looking for, the last thing to put on before going to sleep and perhaps first thing in the morning.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that I am a 29 year old female with dry skin, prone to breakouts. I have been using Oil of Olay products for a while but thought I would give this a try.    I have had at least two people say my skin has a marked improvement, without me even asking or bringing it up. I can also tell the difference. My skin looks tighter and has a healthy shine and glow to it.    As an added feature, my lips also appear to be fuller. I don&#x27;t really put much of the product on my lips, as I simply rub my hand across my mouth when applying the product. I can tell a big difference there.    I will continue to use the product and probably alternative with Oil of Olay.     I know this product might work great for me but not others. You just have to try it. We are all different.</li>
    <li> I am 74, soon to be 75 and have always tried to take care of my skin. Never been a sun worshiper either so my skin was in pretty good condition, but looking a little faded. I bought some Youth Code serum and cream on a whim in a drugstore and have been using it faithfully for about a month. Today I went to a new beautician and she remarked, twice, on my \\&quot;beautiful\\&quot; skin. :) She said it just has a glow about it. That was a pretty nice thing to hear at my age.</li>
    <li> Firstly, this is not a cheap cream. It&#x27;s expensive by most standards... especially if bought at supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;The cream feels nice going on and yes there is a degree of moisturising. But it does none of what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick and highly perfumed. It made my skin break out, which I have never had happen from anything and never had any skin problems or acne even in teens. It clogged my pores so badly that I have little lumps under the skin on my cheeks, that I&#x27;m still trying to get fixed 2 months later. It has cost me a lot in exfoliating products, facials and new creams to repair the damage that this expensive cream caused. Horrible disappointment.</li>
    <li> not the best for oily skin types. i wish loreal would make this cream for oily skin types. i use the one for night and eyes, i cannot wear this one during the day since it would leave my skin very oily.</li>
    <li> I use this one together with the Youth code serum, it make skin looks healthy shine and glow,  I will continue using it and see the wonderful change on my skin</li>
    <li> I was really excited about a cream for day and for night in one convenient product. Within a week, I noticed fewer really fine lines around my eyes. I also noticed an overall smoothness that I didn&#x27;t have before using Youth Code. It helps to keep a youthful appearance, and that&#x27;s really important as I am in my mid 30s. I also like that this product is affordable, as it&#x27;s really hard for most people to spend $100 on the fancy mall store creams. This one works just as well, and I look forward to continued skin improvements as I keep using Youth Code.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I am a member of Smiley360, an online community of consumers who love trying new brands for free and sharing their authentic opinions and feedback with friends.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free in exchange for my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this product for 2 days but I have to say \\&quot; I Love It\\&quot;. It is a thick face moisturizer. And I like that. I have not noticed any difference in the appearance of my face but I&#x27;m sure I will notice after using it a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream!!!! First time that I try this product and I love the way it leaves my skin!!!</li>
    <li> I receive this through a sample program and I loved it. It really made my face look younger. It was noticably softer in a week and fine lines are nearly none existent.</li>
    <li> I had received this as a free sample from Smiley360 and decided to buy it. It is light and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy but works like no one&#x27;s business. I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on those high dollar facial creams so this not only works great but, it doesn&#x27;t kill my wallet. I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received this as a  FREE sample through Smiley360.  I am in love!  The youth code moisturizer is lightweight and easy to apply. It is immediately absorbed into your skin. It has a light scent and very creamy.  After I use it my skin feels moist and youthful.  I have been using it daily and can notice a difference.  A little goes a long way too!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Day/Night Cream has a lot of good things going for it.  I really like that it can be used for the day, and the night.  No need to switch products!  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.  The texture is thick and it goes on well.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky or greasy residue.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and haven&#x27;t really noticed any reduction of fine lines (which is why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5).  However, I would purchase this product as it is a great all around face cream.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to try out.  I have been using it nightly for the past few weeks, and overall I am pleased with it.  It is very creamy, and applies easily.  It feels like it moisturizes my skin nicely, without being too much for the warm summer months.  I do think it is a bit too intense for me to use as a morning moisturizer (plus I want one with SPF).  I have not noticed major changes in my skin since I started using it, but do feel that it is a quality product.</li>
    <li> Cream feels bit heavy n oily.&lt;br /&gt;Used it for 3 months but no changes in my skin.Skin still feels dull n lifeless.</li>
    <li> great product.  I have used it for some time.  I have sensitive skin and it works well for me</li>
    <li> Moisture skin very well</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. It is the third time I purchased it for her. Expensive for a cream but it seems for a good reason.</li>
    <li> I used this mainly as a night cream, even though the directions indicate that it can be used for both day and night. I used it after toner, for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Moisturizing, light fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Oily, Not the best for sensitive skin (I broke out while using this), Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will try another product next time. While I did want a moisturizing cream, this cream felt oily on my sensitive skin, and I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in terms of &#x27;rejuvenation&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I ran out weeks ago and thought I could make do with other moisturizer I had on hand.  After using this wonderful product again for only one week, I can see a distinct difference in my skin.  It is hydrated and supple, I have a glow, and my skin looks younger.  Honest!  This is a product that works magic!</li>
    <li> As I approach 30 next year I realized my skin is looking less youthful. So I decided it was time to go past face wash and sunscreen and try out a &#x27;real&#x27; face cream.    I am crazy glad I tried this. i&#x27;d seen it in a half dozen magazines and a girlfriend of mine got a sample. The rave reviews were everywhere. Since I had an amazon giftcard to significantly lower the price I bit the bullet and purchased it. Even if I hated it my money was less than a quarter of what I&#x27;d spend in store (and the price on Amazon beats everywhere else by at least 30%)    This lives up to the hype. The best part would be you literally need no more than a finger tips worth to cover your entire face. The immediate results of a nice, smooth face were terrific. Not too oily and not too dry (I have very combo skin with an oily forehead and dry cheeks). It goes on easily. I used it for both day and night and by nighttime your face still feels smooth and like you don&#x27;t need anymore.    Since starting to use it I&#x27;ve been surprised to notice the evening in skin tone especially. And the oomph back to my face. No, I don&#x27;t look like an 18 year old kid again. But my skin does feel remarkable and it does look more full of life.    I will have no problem paying full price when I run out of this (which, at this rate? will be a very. long. time.) It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot for anyone looking to start a facial care routine to bring back a bit of youth that time, kids, lack of sleep, and poor face care did to your face. (And, hey, if I weren&#x27;t so minimalistic I&#x27;d try the whole line because if this ONE product makes this much of a difference? I bet the rest would be amazing.)</li>
    <li> This is a great mositurizer! I&#x27;ve used plenty of expensive department store moisturizers and this is as good, if not better. Soaks in right away, doesnt leave skin greasy. Love the way my skin feels when I wake up in the morning, its soooo soft. I dont know how much it really does for fine lines because I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and don&#x27;t really have lines yet. As far as moisturizing goes its great!</li>
    <li> it does leave your face feeling nice and smooth</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!  I usually have no skin problems whatsoever, but after only two or three days of usage, my face erupted.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen ever before!</li>
    <li> I love Hope in a Jar- but I needed something a little more affordable, and also a little more hydrating.  Enter Youth Code.  I&#x27;m skeptical about all moisturizers because my skin tends to break out easily.  So when I tried Youth Code, I was worried that I would be dealing with some blemishes again.  WRONG!  My face felt hydrated, and my skin stayed clear.  I&#x27;ve just finished a 2nd container and will be purchasing a 3rd.</li>
    <li> Love this product, after first week of use can tell the difference lines are diminished just love it. Delivery excellent</li>
    <li> I like very much Loreal as a brand quality presentation results and price. I add now the serum and the results are more than  I expected.</li>
    <li> I like this.  It&#x27;s great for the winter because it&#x27;s a nice think moisturizer.  I like the way my skin looks and feels while using this.  It does have a fragrance.  It&#x27;s  a nice fragrance, and it does wear off after a little bit, not overpowering.  I am chemically sensitive to smells, and it bothers me on some days but not everyday.  I only gave it 4 stars because I wish it had a fragrance free option.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Day/Night Cream packagings had been opened, no manual.and I do not know whether the product is reduced.</li>
    <li> I had wanted to try Youth Code for a long time and I am sure glad I did.  It is a great product which I will buy again.</li>
    <li> first i have to say that i got this as a free sample from smiley 360. but i love what this day/night cream does for my face. i had some signs of age showing on my face. after i used this cream i didn&#x27;t have anymore. i use this all the time. it&#x27;s the best that i have found and i really like what it does for my face.</li>
    <li> I received a sample jar of this product for free from Smiley360, and I have been so impressed with the results that I have seen in just a few days.  I am a BUSY mom of three children -- never giving my skin the time and attention that it deserves.  This neglect has aged my face a lot over the past few years, and I thought that the possibility of reversing it had passed.  Within a few days of regularly applying the Youth Code cream to my face, I began to notice a softness and firmness to my skin -- especially the heavily wrinkled areas (around my mouth, my forehead, and my eyes).  My skin seems to have more radiance, instead of looking flat and dull.  I cannot believe that I&#x27;ve seen such positive results within such a short amount of time.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it can do after long-term use! We are on a tight budget, so knowing that I can maintain this new miracle skin regimen makes it a win/win situation...for my skin and my wallet!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. I rarely gush about beauty products. In fact they usually just make me blotchy or make my face break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a freebie or I probably would not have even tried it. When I got it in the mail, I patch tested it on my arm and was reassured it would be fine. It is greaseless, nearly odorless and feels quite nice. The first night I put it on my face I was still a little nervous but in the morning they had a fan. My face was smoother! My occasional redness was not present and my pores seemed smaller. A little red bump I had on the chin was less noticable too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wear full coverage makeup every day, usually just a bit of tinted sunscreen and a tinted lip balm. On the third day I did wear some real makeup to go out that evening. It went on smoother, I needed less coverage. Once I was done with it, it looked almost airbrushed. It seemed to cover my freckles (I hope those are still all freckles) up completely for once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine is simple now, a bit of Cetaphil cleanser for sensitive skin, some Youth Code, sunscreen, lip balm and out the door. After a week I have had people ask me if I lost weight, a couple people told me I look so great and one woman at work actually pulled me aside to ask me what I was using. I happily told her about Youth Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got carded. Seriously, carded for real. I actually had to dig for my license in my purse afraid I would not get my cocktail. I am forty years old this past October. Impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried lots of products in the past, everything from drugstore to La Mer (trust me that was a gift, I can&#x27;t afford that in reality). I was using Clinique&#x27;s rosacea and dark spot correctors more recently. No more. This works better and is so much cheaper. No gloppiness, no odd scents, no irritation. I am sold!</li>
    <li> Recieved my free sample from smiley360 i really like the product. I started noticing a difference within a few days!</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with the results after just a few days of using this product. I not only saw a difference in my fine lines settling in my face but it felt softer and more radiant as time went on. The product works wonders and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had to throw it away because I developed zits after using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Day/Night Cream.</li>
    <li> not a fan made my pores look huge</li>
    <li> So glad I found this cream!  I&#x27;ve tried the other, more expensive creams and didn&#x27;t like them or really couldn&#x27;t justify the obscenely high cost for the tiny amount.  This cream has the same ingredients as those high cost creams/moisturizers for just under $20!  My skin is super sensitive so I was hesitant at first but I had no reaction and it really does deliver.  I&#x27;ve used it in the morning under makeup and at night before bed for over a year and my skin shows it.  It moisturizes, has evened out my skin tone and has definitely diminished the wrinkles and fine lines that were appearing.  It&#x27;s lightweight, let&#x27;s your skin breathe and I think, has improved the overall appearance of my skin.  Not giving this up anytime soon!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from smiley 360 to test and its a must have product of mine! Leaves skin soft and regenerated like no other skin care product!</li>
    <li> First off let my say I received a FREE sample of this from Smiley360 to try out. I was a little skeptical at first but once I started using it, I fell in love with it. I love that it&#x27;s not greasy or oily, it didn&#x27;t clog my pores and it made my skin feel so moisturize and youthful. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and I love it, so I&#x27;m going to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This has great texture and smells amazing! just tried a sample and I already want to purchase it after I use it up. It is very soft and mosturizes really well</li>
    <li> I received a FREE sample of loreal youth code day/night cream.  I tried it, and I LOVED IT.  My skin instantly felt hydrated, and smoothed.  After about a week I started to notice that my skin felt more plump and supple.  This is a great product for us 30 something&#x27;s who are just starting to notice the signs of aging.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of L&#x27;Oreal youth Code last week, June 7. I like the fact that I can apply it morning and night. I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s working cause I have only been using it for a short time. I do like the scent not to strong and it&#x27;s not a heavy cream. It&#x27;s a light cream. I love L&#x27;Oreal products so I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed using this.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code from Smiley 360.  I usually use Clinique facial products.  I was a little hesitant since any sort of change to my skincare regimen causes breakouts.  Well I used this and it made my skin so soft. It went on and was almost weightless.  And YES no breakouts as of yet, it&#x27;s been about a week so far.  I would definitely recommend this to friends and family. Thanks L&#x27;Oreal for a great product.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be able to receive a free sample of L&#x27;oreal Youth Code from smiley360.com. I have been using it day and night for 2 weeks now and honestly I am not looking any younger! Like most products though they can take months to start noticing a difference.&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed about this product and the reason I give it 4 stars is for its moisturizing benefit. Using very little of this cream morning and night has really helped soften and make my skin feel so soft! The scent to me is also pleasant. Not over bearing, very light crisp clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Also my skin tends to be sensitive at times and so far I have not noticed any type of rash,irritance,etc accompying my use of it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall..I would buy this to use as my face moisturizer but as far as looking younger (less wrinkles, etc.) I&#x27;m still waiting on someone finding that fountain of youth!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the cream and my skin is softer and feels great when I use this cream. Very gentle cream as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the various Oil of Olays and other L&#x27;Oreal facial lotions but this one makes my face so soft without being oily. It feels light on the face, smooths my wrinkles around my eyes and lips and works well with my make up. I will definitely be purchasing this lotion for now on.</li>
    <li> This is really soft. Makes your skin baby smooth. Just remember to wash your face and use a pore cleanser then this to make it even more effective. Beware of friends that may pet you after using this.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer! It makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.  I have so many lotions and moisturizers but this is the best.  Spend the extra money.  It&#x27;s worth it and the jar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It has a strong smell but has been great on my skin.  I would definately buy it again. Recommended for light wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light cream that seems to work very well (I have normal skin) and, like all of the L&#x27;Oreal products, it is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This was a first for face cream ..I actually have never used cream ..I am 38 now so I figured why not.. Maybe it will retain some youth right? Although it feels great I don&#x27;t see a visible difference. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer! It leaves my skin feeling soft without breaking out. I am prone to acne,but not with this product. I have tried many others, but I keep coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> This cream is great.  I noticed my fine lines looked smoother and my skin brighter after using it twice a day for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I use this for day moisturizer - feels lighter but still great coverage, light fragrance but doesn&#x27;t bother me and I do have allergies and reactions to some products.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews and they are right. it works. I&#x27;ve noticed my wrinkles are less noticeable. I will def. buy this again! Love it</li>
    <li> This is wonderful even for the most sensitive skin. It absorbs quickly, and is not greasy or heavy. word word</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the good reviews on this.. Its like any other face lotion that I could purchase at 1/3 of the price. Way over priced here marked at 19.99. Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 19, and extremely fussy about what goes on my face. I hate anything too liquid or too greasy, and my skin reacts badly to anything with SPF in it (almost every day cream!) For years I&#x27;ve had too much pride to try any cream for wrinkles, but a month ago I finally surrendered and I&#x27;m glad I did! This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used! It has the perfect consistancy - it almost feels like primer as you put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin in the same way. As for getting rid of wrinkles and age spots, I can&#x27;t testify but maybe I&#x27;ll update this in 20 years...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and I used this product for three days, small amounts morning and night.  On the first day, I loved it!  Then on the second day I noticed a weird pimple on my neck and forehead.  And on the third my face had broken out in a rash.  I have sensitive skin and can break out in a rash if I stay at a hotel or sometimes in the spring, but this was a lot more widespread than that.  I know it was from the cream because I&#x27;ve never had issues with my neck before and the rash was on my neck.  I normally break out with 1 pimple during my period or sometimes if I don&#x27;t wash my face after working out, but I immediately received pimples in odd places after using this cream that were painful!  But strangest of all, I had a pimple on my cheek about a week ago and it was all but disappeared.  After three days of using this cream, that area is now a red blotch!  It wasn&#x27;t red before either.  I guess my skin has rejected the &#x27;youth code&#x27; and I&#x27;m meant to be old.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to product need tefunds</li>
    <li> buen articulo llego a la fecha sin ningún problema 100% confiable el vendedor,operacion realizada sin ningun tipo de incoveniente el producto llena mi perspectiva</li>
    <li> silky and rich on the face. will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really love the feel of this cream on my skin and the aroma is wonderful.. I will continue to use</li>
    <li> Too expensive! may be one can see the difference in skin if has been used for more than a year, but this is mt 2nd container in a row and I do not find much change.</li>
    <li> I used to use Neutrogena, but my skin&#x27;s become sensitive to retinol, so I looked through the drugstore moisturizes for something without retinol and found this. My skin seems better with it than without it, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It&#x27;s cheaper on a big sale at the drugstore but a hassle to get at the cheapest drugstore price. The Amazon.com price is almost as good and buying it through Amazon is easy and quick. I&#x27;ll do it again.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s pretty amazing. I&#x27;ve paid 3x as much for other creams and they didn&#x27;t work as well and were much greasier for my skin.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter.  She loves how it makes her skin look.</li>
    <li> WOW! I did tons of research, read tons of reviews, and finally settled on this one. So glad that I did. I used to have these tiny pimples around my hairline. I honestly don&#x27;t know the last time they weren&#x27;t there. I just chalked it up to aging. Within a week of using this, I noticed a difference. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and those little bumps are completely gone and my skin feels SOOOO soft! It&#x27;s amazing what a good moisturizer can do! I am officially never buying dirt cheap moisturizers again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion, my mom had purchased some a while back on sale and I just had to buy more. It is perfect for the day time but also perfect for putting a bit more on at night. My skin gets very dry especially in the winter so this is a must for me!</li>
    <li> Really love this cream.  I apply it at night along with my vitamin C serum and it leaves my face feeling smooth and very moisturized.</li>
    <li> My face and neck are no longer dry and rough... very soft and no dry spots anymore!</li>
    <li> My sister is using this product and she likes it a lot... So, I bought one for me but sorry to say that did&#x27;t work well on my skin...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
