<li> When I finally got a pair to separate and that I could use they were okay, but hard to remove.  </li>
<li> First, instructions were not really clear nor in English.  </li>
<li> The shaper was worn less than 3 hours and the skin was ripped up and took 2 days to get back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Sadly, the membrane, or the glue, was not tough enough.</li>
<li> The instructions are written in some foreign language.  </li>
<li> I would say its not worth the 8$ and it takes forever to ship.</li>
<li> when removed several hours later, there was a nasty rash on top of both breasts which lasted at least 24 hours.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it was not strong enough to support me.  </li>
<li> you want unless you are a small cup size.  </li>
<li> Also, they irritated my skin so badly that I had red marks for days after I took them off, and it felt like ripping skin off when they come off.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s not good to sweat while wearing it</li>
<li> These were a little difficult to apply and difficult to take off.  </li>
<li> BUT EVEN WORSE -</li>
<li> It came with no instructions on how to remove them and it was so hard to remove and it tore my skin in several places, it was very painful.</li>
<li> Then they were difficult to get on correctly</li>
<li> This is completely useless for me.  </li>
<li> It is almost impossible to use,</li>
<li> They are painful to remove and if it ever sticks to itself you can forget it.  </li>
<li> The shaper and the \\&quot;cutting\\&quot; directions were pathetic and did not work well.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>

    <li> They don&#x27;t work as well as described. i am not someone with saggy boobs, but i wanted more support when i go bra less. didn&#x27;t really get that.</li>
    <li> It came with no instructions on how to remove them and it was so hard to remove and it tore my skin in several places, it was very painful.</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of this product when I saw how it worked.  Unfortunately, it was not strong enough to support me.  Sadly, the membrane, or the glue, was not tough enough.</li>
    <li> 1.  The shapers were all stuck together in the package.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The shaper and the \\&quot;cutting\\&quot; directions were pathetic and did not work well.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The shaper was worn less than 3 hours and the skin was ripped up and took 2 days to get back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help flatter my shape and go braless. Being a breast cancer survivor, I have one silicone breast and one gravity affected breast.&lt;br /&gt;This shaper lifts my real breast up equally to my silicone one. And I get a more appealing look without having to wear a bra. Will be buying this product regularly.</li>
    <li> bought for my girlfriend she wasn&#x27;t happy that i did but her boobs are saggy and she wears a lot of revealing clothing so she needed this. it&#x27;s not good to sweat while wearing it</li>
    <li> Glad I can finally wear tops without a bra!  They lift well and the stickers stayed in place all day.</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t support large breast women.  Also, don&#x27;t wear in the sun under your swimsuit...burnt the girls.  Great product if it fit.</li>
    <li> These were a little difficult to apply and difficult to take off.  They did work, but not as dramatically as the picture shows.</li>
    <li> Not worth the purchase for those of you who are a full C-cup. Keep your money and invest in a strapless bra</li>
    <li> Yes, they do stick very well, too well in fact!  They don&#x27;t really give you the lifted look you want unless you are a small cup size.  I am a D cup size and they didn&#x27;t really hold up to the weight of the breast.  Also, they irritated my skin so badly that I had red marks for days after I took them off, and it felt like ripping skin off when they come off.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> i dont know if its the brand or all these types of things but i had no problem when i put it on. it gave me a beautiful lift but when i was finished and ready to remove it it tore my skin in several place and my skin dont tear if i wax i wax all the time.</li>
    <li> you cant wear these with low cut shirts it basically folds your boob. i really didnt like this product. i wont be buying it again</li>
    <li> Great while on our cruise with certain clothing. Would purchase again. Was able to wear with formal dress and tube tops.</li>
    <li> I normally get the Commando low beams product but decided to give this one a try.  The first couple pairs I tried ripped before I could get them off the backing.  When I finally got a pair to separate and that I could use they were okay, but hard to remove.  Commando&#x27;s product is muuuuch better.</li>
    <li> This is completely useless for me.  The instructions are written in some foreign language.  It is almost impossible to use, especially when you&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t have instructions.  They are painful to remove and if it ever sticks to itself you can forget it.  I tried to use one and ended up with&lt;br /&gt;a rolled up ball.  I couldn&#x27;t send it back because it was opened.....  Don&#x27;t know how you would know you didn&#x27;t like it if you didn&#x27;t open it.&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy this product again.  It is in a drawer in my bedroom.</li>
    <li> First, instructions were not really clear nor in English.  Then they were difficult to get on correctly so I had to use part of another set. BUT EVEN WORSE - when removed several hours later, there was a nasty rash on top of both breasts which lasted at least 24 hours.  Returned them straight away.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> First of all I have to say I was really excited to try this product- I got them before I went to Vegas. I only wore them for a few hours and when I took them off I was literally scarred for life. This product ripped my skin off and left scrapes and scars all over my boobs. I was highly dissatisfied with this product and can&#x27;t believe I paid money to get scars that would be left forever. I would say its not worth the 8$ and it takes forever to ship. Save yourself and do not purchase these !</li>
    <li> I am a DD. I knew these were not going to work for me, but I had a plan for making them work. I used these with my strapless to get a bit of extra lift. It worked swimmingly. If you have ample breasts these will not give you any lift and will will make your breasts look funny. But under a atrapless bra it gave a little more lift which was what I was looking for.</li>
