    <li> Gives you many options.</li>
    <li> This item is ok, but not one that I&#x27;d reorder. Looks easy to use, but actually it was quite difficult keeping the stencil in place while filling in color. Maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>

    <li> I needed help drawing and this did the job.</li>
    <li> I got this because my eyebrows are lighter and thinning as I get a little older. I am a beautician, and thought this would be Great! Held it up, positioned it, used my eyebrow pencil, looked in the mirror and saw Joan Crawford&#x27;s twin! Wiped my eyes, and got it right!</li>

    <li> Great stencil, but it takes time and practice to get them just right.</li>
    <li> Shot! You can&#x27;t line it up on your face and mark in at the same time!</li>
    <li> These are actually pretty good. Not like I had before but diffently more space to hold to fill in brow. That&#x27;s a plus!!</li>
    <li> Got to me extremely fast.</li>
    <li> Great when shaping the eyebrow.</li>
    <li> HARD TO USE WITH ONE HAND AND TRY TO USE LINER WITH THE OTHER</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my mom and she didn&#x27;t like them at all. She said it was too hard to hold and difficult for her to put her brows.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are uneven every time i draw on it. So glad I purchased these easy to used and it came with different shape. I can tell my eyebrows now are even!</li>
    <li> good to use. swift delivery.</li>
    <li> Needed English instructions.</li>
    <li> Stupid..maybe works on a doll really dumb</li>
    <li> I am mostly blind in one eye, so I&#x27;ve had difficulty with my eyebrows. Usually one will look fine while the other is somewhat out of whack.

I like these stencils because they allow me to maintain symmetry and fill my current eyebrow shape (and tweeze rogue hairs) without as much difficulty.</li>
    <li> This was for someone else</li>
    <li> wow fun to use just wish it had more variety of shapes</li>
    <li> Thank a lot this help me so much because I&#x27;m sick at doing my eyebrows but after I order this I&#x27;m super at it and I love it</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Want to achieve the perfect brows. This is for you. You will look like you had them professionally done.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using the stencil as a guide</li>
    <li> They are nice you get different shapes and sizes</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste the $2.00. Stencils are too small, clumsy and the shapes were so similar, you couldn&#x27;t tell that much difference...</li>
    <li> These were ok. None of them were really shaped to my face or eyebrows and the shapes were not particular shapes I wanted. Overall, it does it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Ehh these aren&#x27;t bad but they help some what.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and very pleased.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, does not fit the shape of my brows.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Have not used it much. Wish there was a brush/powder that came with it. The brushes I&#x27;ve been using doesn&#x27;t completely fill in so it looks thinner than the actual stencil. I always have to fill in.</li>
    <li> Was pleasantly surprised by the product. Gave my brows a great shape and im look forward to using in the future</li>
    <li> Stencils were entirely too large for my face.  If I used them my eyebrows would have met up with my hairline.</li>
    <li> this works very well. But be careful where you place it before outlining...that&#x27;s the trick.</li>
