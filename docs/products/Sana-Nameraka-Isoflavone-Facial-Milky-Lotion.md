      <li>good product.</li>
      <li>However, it does absorb fairly well anyways</li>
      <li>It works good.</li>
      <li>No color, no smell, feel like very healthy.</li>
      <li>That is what we need in America the most!    </li>
      <li>This lotion is very light; it&#x27;s good for oily skin type and during the summer.  </li>

      <li>I really love its feeling on face or body.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay product.</li>

      <li>This lotion does a good job on your skin, it was absorbed quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably not the best product for a super dry skin.</li>

      <li>Soy - as a drink, in the shape of tofu and as cosmetics - flippin&#x27; fantastic.</li>
      <li>It worked well, and absorbed by my skin very quick.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Little to no scent and absorbs quickly.</li>

      <li>This whole line of cosmetics is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Its very very watery/milky and smells very funny.</li>

      <li>my skin is very sentitive and oily on T-zone .this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not lotion, it&#x27;s milky lotion, so it is really liquidity.</li>

    <li> This lotion is very light; it&#x27;s good for oily skin type and during the summer.  I like that it is fragrance-free.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s heavier than I thought. After all, it is milky lotion, not a toner. But I bought it to use as a toner, and during spring &amp; summer, this may be a tad heavy on application. However, it does absorb fairly well anyways and you may not mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me however, I&#x27;d stick to Kiehl&#x27;s cucumber toner for the warmer months and use this on top as lotion b4 sleep. For winter, this one is my toner and it works well on my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little to no scent and absorbs quickly. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I brought a seris products of this brand.  Because my japanese friends told me that, this is the cheapest beauty product. And no Alchol in it.    I like it a lot. It&#x27;s different from American beauty product.   Because I&#x27;m asian. So I dont like to use western product here a lot. I prefer something from Asian. because it&#x27;s desgin for our skin^^ even though sometimes they also have it here in USA.    And it keeps you very Moisture a lot! That is what we need in America the most!    So the product is really good!</li>
    <li> Not recommended for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I really love its feeling on face or body. Very rich but light weight and easy to spread and be absorbed. No color, no smell, feel like very healthy. I used up the whole bottle from the very beginning. And the price is reasonable. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of much more expensive moisture, but not feel as good as this one.</li>
    <li> It worked well, and absorbed by my skin very quick. It&#x27;s not lotion, it&#x27;s milky lotion, so it is really liquidity. And I think it work well on my face!</li>

    <li> very helpful for asian skin.</li>
    <li> It works good. It&#x27;s probably not the best product for a super dry skin. But it&#x27;s pretty good for this price range. Its texture is very smooth, and not super oily. Also since it&#x27;s made in Japan, you don&#x27;t have to worry about GMO soys.</li>
    <li> This Japanese lotion is not the average lotion. Its very very watery/milky and smells very funny. Not what i expected from a Japanese brand but not for me.</li>
    <li> This lotion does a good job on your skin, it was absorbed quickly. I heard this product from a tv show and bought it for a try, i have been using it for 2 weeks and my skin was not dry like before. And the price was not too high, recommend for teenage.</li>
