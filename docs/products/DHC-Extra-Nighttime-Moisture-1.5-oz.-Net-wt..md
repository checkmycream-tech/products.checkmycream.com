<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received a free sample of this lotion in the mail, liked it, and ordered it on Amazon after I read the great reviews. I am on my second jar of it now, and I really like the lotion.  I put it on each night, and my skin feels softer and moister in the morning.</li>
    <li> Love all DHC products!! Great price, fast delivery!! This night cream is wonderful! Thanks</li>
    <li> I like it, but would have preferred extra moisture without fruit acids. Otherwise, very good. I just can&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> So far best nighttime moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t clog but works.</li>
    <li> Let me just be clear, the typical American beauty routine of cleanse-tone-moisturize DOES NOT WORK with Japanese or even Korean products. You need to incorporate more beauty steps in order to attain perfectly moisturized skin. Aside from Japanese and Koreans having cleaner diets, how else do you think they maintain such beautiful and youthful skin well into their fifties? My night time routine is as follows: cleansing oil, collagen cleansing balm, cleansing milk, korean moisturizing toner (different from japanese), face mask, ceramidin liquid, ceramidin cream,  serum, DHC NIGHT CREAM, skin perfecting revitalizer cream and moisturizing Q10 oil to seal everything in. That&#x27;s 11 steps. Which mind you, is bare minimum in comparison to Japanese and Korean women use in their beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because my skin went a little haywire for a few days but the little acne have disappeared. 5 stars for helping get rid of facial eczema around my lips. I&#x27;m saving more money now because I don&#x27;t have to spend crazy amounts of money buying lip balms when I&#x27;m already paying crazy amounts for my skin routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind if you have eczema on your face, what worked for me, might not work for you because eczema is different for everyone who has it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has done this but when I got my samples in the mail I got the Makeup Primer the Cleansing Oil and the Extra Night Time Moisture product. I tried all before and liked them but the oil was frankly too oily and the cream felt nice but I wanted a different consistency.&lt;br /&gt;I happen to have very wrinkled old looking hands. I decided to mix the Night Time Moisture with the cleansing oil and put it on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I am telling you it felt amazing and more than that the difference in my hands was like night and day!&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend mentioned my hands the next morning!&lt;br /&gt;Try it. I am just floored.</li>
    <li> Used nightly, after a few weeks, I notice a positive change!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it!  It does a great job as a moisturizer for night.  Light, yet very concentrated and soothing.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites that I can&#x27;t do without.  I never knew you could order DHC products on Amazon, but love that I now can.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> surprisingly very good for night &amp; day moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is in one word, Fantastic.  It does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Take this from someone who has sold Avon for over 20 years and been through the numerous product changes.  I get quite frustrated when an item I love is discontinued, so I tried DHC and have to say that this is a product that I would recommend to anyone. It feels great on the skin and in the morning there is no dryness.  I even use it on my elbows!</li>
    <li> I had used a sample of this moisturizer prior to purchasing. Of course, the sample only had about 2 nights worth of moisturizer but I was impressed with it&#x27;s results. After purchasing it and using it for a month I find that while it does deliver great moisture, it also seems to be clogging my pores. My face has been breaking out and I&#x27;m 39 years old. I&#x27;m not 100% sure if the breakout is due to the moisturizer, a reaction to the extreme heat we&#x27;re having in Texas this summer or a combination of both. I plan to try using it again once the weather is a bit cooler to see if the breakouts continue. So bottom line, great moisturizer for those that need a heavy moisturizer but beware of the pore clogging possibilities. If your skin is prone to breakouts, you should probably opt for something lighter.</li>
    <li> Purchased directly from DHC. Disappointing - instead of moisturizing my skin it dries it out. Very small jar for the money, almost sample size. Found an inexpensive and working moisture treatment for aging, dry skin - pure coconut oil. It&#x27;s natural and it works.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My face is so dry that I can use this night cream during the day and it is not too greasy.</li>
    <li> Best night cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Keeps my skin soft even through the harsh winter months.  Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts (and I have acne prone skin).</li>
    <li> Face feels wonderful and looks wonderful in the mornings</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference and tends to break me out more than usual. While the product is not too horrible I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Only product that works for my dry skin in winter and trust me I tried the very expensive ones. See I reordered</li>
    <li> Love the way my skins looks in the morning</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it basically....the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t disappear yet doesn&#x27;t break me out :)</li>
    <li> very nice product. i wish it melted in better - but it&#x27;s high quality and i think most people would love it. i&#x27;m just picky and looking for perfection.</li>
    <li> I am not loving this moisturizer, but it could be worse, it could be winter.  I don&#x27;t think it actually moisturizes enough.  I waited to write this review until I had used it for a few a weeks. I definitely will NOT be purchasing again, seems like you either love it or it you don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m disappointed I wasted the money on it instead of purchasing something else. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> My wife has changed her complete cosmetic products to DHC. She has sensitive skin and cannot use many of the name brand cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;The DHC line of products including this product are compatible with her sensitive skin. She all the DHC products she has purchased to date.&lt;br /&gt;This company (Olive Care) offered this product at a competitive price with fast delivery.</li>
    <li> again, with this product, I used it a couple of times and because I have sensitive skin it started to burn my skin, so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> So far I am quite happy with the DHC brand.  While this nighttime cream tends to be a tad on the greasy side I have not had problems with it clogging pores.  My skin feels comfortable and soft in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Love it. It my skin so soft and not dryer out.</li>
    <li> After cleansing and toning your skin put on this terrific moisturizer before bedtime. Your skin won&#x27;t feel tight and dried out as can happen if you reside in a dry climate, which I do. Your face and neck (put it on your neck too) will stay soft even if you&#x27;re in a hurry in the A.M.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I live in a very dry climate (high desert).  I&amp;#34;ve tried other , less expensive creams.  They don&#x27;t do the job.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over 20 years.  It&#x27;s the on ly one that works for me.</li>
    <li> I love it. Use it every night.</li>
    <li> the best night cream that I ever used</li>
    <li> i have used this many times and love it. It has a very nice consistency and feels good on the face.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything on my face and this cream is the best cream for moisture I have ever used. I highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference in how moist my skin is in the morning.  Its not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love the DHC products. I just started using this. It seems great for the dry climate we live in.</li>
    <li> Wonderful comforting nighttime cream, sinks right into your skin! Smooth, not at all greasy, creamy and satisfying.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else now that I&#x27;ve discovered it.</li>
    <li> Love all DHC products. All are quality.  Made in Japan, uses olive oil and is a great night time&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer. I use a lot of their products.</li>
    <li> Great product, and I love the fact that I can get the product thru Amazon.  Thank you for giving me the option of buying it on my favorite website.</li>
    <li> Best winter moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin.  Does a great job.</li>
    <li> Wonderful night time cream. It does the job moisturizing and I feel my skin looks the better for it. It is a heavier cream so it&#x27;s definitely for use at night. I can sometimes breakout from cream use and this one does not cause acne nor irritate my skin in anyway.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I use the DHC Nightime Moisture as a day cream under my make up. So far so good with the cold dry weather we are experiencing here in Wisconsin.</li>
    <li> this product was advertised in consumer ratings as equivalent to the much more expensive La Mer.  it is not equivalent.  I have to use this as a daytime product as well because my skin requires extra moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! None greasy and really improves my skin. I use it day and night. Will purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am 62 and have fine, fair skin.  I use this moisturizer everynight and it has really helped keep my skin plump &amp; hydrated.  It is very creamy and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a decade. No other product comes close to this. It feels so great on your skin. I am on a very fixed income now and have tried to find less expensive ones to use, even plain coconut oil. I have decided this is one of 3 items i will never go without. Also love being able to get amazon prime shipping with it now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying from dhc for a few years. Happy to get the extra nightime moisture at a lower price from Amazon</li>
    <li> a little greaseie, when put on , but sink in, I like it, skin is soft</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer. As good as any I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to trying this and it just wasn&#x27;t for me. It was really thick which I liked but it never seemed to fully absorb into my skin. I gave it to my mom to try.</li>
    <li> DHC makes quality products. I have sensitive skin and can only use DHC or Clinique. I also have end stage rosacea. This product is excellent for use at night. I use Clinique&#x27;s Redness solution daily cream during the day. Clinique combats the redness and DHC night moisturizer helps keep extra cells slough&#x27;d off, especially when you have rosacea. Opal</li>
    <li> After using DHC Concentrated Eye Cream I tried this Nighttime Moisture. This is an amazing product! It delivers: lines less noticeable, dryness gone, gentle. I have very sensitive skin and have been challenged to find a night moisturizer after many caused rashes. This product just feels so good, and the morning after only one use I had noticeably softer, smoother, moisturized skin. This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this night and day. At night I clean my face with DHC&#x27;s deep cleansing oil, then put this on, and hold in the moisture around my eyes with dabs of vasoline. During the day, I use this and then the velvet skin coat followed by foundation for a great-looking, moist skin tone. I&#x27;m becoming a big fan of DHC&#x27;s skin care products.</li>
    <li> great product for extra-dry skin</li>
    <li> Love (and I do mean LOVE) this moisturizer. I wear it day and night for very dry skin. It&#x27;s heaven. It does not irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> i use the night time cream for the day, i have very dry skin, this is prettie good stuff. a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> The nighttime moisture was good, as I had expected.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of products on my skin to rehydrate given the amount of traveling via airplane for work and this has absolutely changed my skin tone and texture in a very short few weeks!  On days I&#x27;m traveling, I actually wear this in the daytime under makeup for improved hydration but may try the daytime version.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great  product !! Love it !!</li>
    <li> I love DHC products and have used a lot of them over the past 10 years. I just started using this a month ago because my skin is in need of something creamier and thicker at night and this stuff is really good. I notice my skin feels healthier and softer and suppler during the day. And a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t be put off by the price. I use just a dab on my fingertips each night and it&#x27;s plenty.</li>
    <li> Extra Nighttime Moisture is a great product day or night.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Feels nice and has a pleasant scent. Time will tell if it works</li>
    <li> Even though I can&#x27;t live without DHC Concentrated Eye Cream, this Extra Nighttime Moisture Cream did nothing for my dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite moisturizer.  I use this every time I get out of the shower.  It says &amp;#34;nighttime&amp;#34; but I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Still have wrinkles !</li>
    <li> night cream is good.  should have ordered a daytime moisturizer too and  something to help the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great nighttime cream for normal aging skin. (I&#x27;m 65.)</li>
    <li> Love it. Will order again.</li>
    <li> It has the best moisture than anything I have tried. It is best on mature skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is fabulous.  It&#x27;s not greasy and does a nice job of keeping my face moisturized.</li>
    <li> Mother in law loves this product and asks for it every Christmas</li>
