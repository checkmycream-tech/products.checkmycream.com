      <li>Love the color!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve ordered this a couple of times and we love the color!</li>
      <li>I purchased this along with the Turbo Tan Deluxe T65 which worked perfectly giving me a very even tan with no splotches or spots!</li>
      <li>But it does peel off after a week or 2, it does not fade nicely.  </li>
      <li>Basically, what I wanted was a spray tan in the convenience of my own home.  </li>
      <li>Liked this product but didn&#x27;t like the ocean power booster drops.</li>
      <li>If you want a light coat with just a hint of color, it&#x27;s perfect, but I have done two coats, a day apart, and it looked as if I had spent two weeks on the beach working on a perfect tan.  </li>
      <li>The after odor is very strong though.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best sunless tanner I have used.  </li>
      <li>Also, the clear solution is great for fair skin.</li>
      <li>The color is so believable.</li>
      <li>The current smell isnt&#x27; the  greatest, and it will linger with you even after you shower.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that I can do it myself, on my time.  </li>
      <li>Having the spray system at home we can do this ourselves and we get much better results.</li>
      <li>It makes a great color and us very forgiving if your a novice.  </li>
      <li>so I can continue to spray more on to get a deeper color.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and i love it</li>
      <li>, I would suggest making it smell better.</li>
      <li>I get many compliments on my \\&quot;tan.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>At the end of the day, regardless of my personal experience with a product I gotta keep my clients happy!</li>
      <li>Apply moisturizer twice a day, and you&#x27;ll look fantastic, any time of year!  </li>
      <li>Works best if you build up a tan instead of trying to create a deep tan in one session.  </li>
      <li>Ok but like Ntaural Self Tanner from Thermalabs  better</li>
      <li>Seller is reputable and worked with me on a damaged shipment.</li>
      <li>It feels good and smells good and makes your skin baby soft.</li>
      <li>If anyone has any suggestions feel free to comment!</li>
      <li>I use to love to lay in the sun till I had to get 1 spot on my nose tested and it was Basil Cell.</li>
      <li>Most preferred the Norvell solution to this one.  </li>
      <li>It faded on me nicely... not too quick and it faded pretty evenly; however, that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m more fair skinned</li>
      <li>the solution looks good the first day or so</li>
      <li>I am very fair skinned but have built up a nice dark tan and have received many compliments.  </li>
      <li>I get the mixture for light skin and it turns out to be the most beautiful and natural tan I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
      <li>I love that the first day you use it, it has a reddish tint so that it kind of looks like a tan with a bit of a sunburn</li>
      <li>Great color and natural look with application.  </li>
      <li>I am still not the best with the airbrush gun,so I have to be careful when applying the product.</li>
      <li>This product doesnt stink and leaves a really nice golden bronze color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and hard to tan, so the sun isn&#x27;t a good idea for me.</li>
      <li>Easy to see where you&#x27;re spraying.</li>
      <li>I am a believable tan color and the results are very consistent across my body.</li>
      <li>and i even used a little rolling brush, seeing as though i had to wash it all off the best i could get it off</li>
      <li>so there isn&#x27;t a huge overspray on the fan or the clients.  </li>
      <li>and I got free shipping.</li>
      <li>i havent tried but a few others and best results esp in winter with the med 8.5 solution from ocean.</li>
      <li>The color is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>then it turns to a deep tan and looks great.  </li>
      <li>I loved the color and it looks so natural.</li>
      <li>This was shipped SOOOO fast!!!  </li>

      <li>I look like I&#x27;ve had just enough sun to give some good color.</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend this product to others, even fair skinned like myself.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quick and did as promised.</li>
      <li>just leaves a nice golden natural color.</li>
      <li>The product does seem to last pretty good on the skin, up to 7 days.</li>
      <li>Actually smells pretty good.  </li>
      <li>The color is very natural and looks fantastic!  </li>
      <li>Looks so much more natural than the rub on stuff!  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite amazon purchase by far!</li>
      <li>With a little practice you can get great results.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wow!! This was shipped SOOOO fast!!!  I am very impressed!  The product is great, loved it.  I have been going to spray tan salons for years.  Love the fact that I can do it myself, on my time.  I bought the airbrush and the solution.  Great.  The solution is awesome.  The medium leaves a slight red look, like you tanned, but got a little too much sun.  Looks so much more natural than the rub on stuff!  If you are looking for a solution, you have found it.  I search for the best deal, and the price from TCP Global Corp is the BEST!!!   Very happy!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite amazon purchase by far! I&#x27;m officially addicted to spray tan because of this product! The color is perfect. Ive been tan my whole life until I moved to SF and rarely see the sun. This color looks so natural no matter how thick I layer it on! Its awesome!!</li>
    <li> I like this product but only for the summer-time.  Right after application until the next day I had a red undertone-like I had really been out in the sun.  When I showered the next day the color looked more bronzed tan then sun-kissed.  I would recommend only using in the summer months.</li>
    <li> I read review, after review, after review on sunless tanners for months before deciding on this one.  The Ocean Sunless Airbrush Tanning 8.5% Solution is the one I decided on after all of the research.  Basically, what I wanted was a spray tan in the convenience of my own home.  After reading the reviews, some people noted they purchased the GlowFusion Air Glow Air Gun to spray this product on their bodies, so I ordered that too.  It was a mess.  That gun sputtered out the Ocean solution all over, and I had to still rub it in.  So, I decided to just get a small 2 oz spray bottle to spray this solution on my body, then rub it in (always wearing gloves).  If I&#x27;ve got to rub it in anyway, I may as well use a spray bottle that is easier to control than the Air Glow Air Gun.  I am happy with the color the product gives me.  And it does not have a bad odor at all.  But it does peel off after a week or 2, it does not fade nicely.  What I need for this solution is something to mist it on my body, so I do not have to rub it in.  If anyone has any suggestions feel free to comment!</li>
    <li> I think this product delivers what it says. I am still not the best with the airbrush gun,so I have to be careful when applying the product. The product does seem to last pretty good on the skin, up to 7 days.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I loved the color and it looks so natural. When you first put it on you look really red! I was worried at first but after you shower it looks like really nice tan and smells good !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and i love it, when you first get sprayed with this you look crazy dark but i leave it on for about 45mins and then rinse it off ..when i wake up im tan its not to dark or to light it just leaves a nice golden natural color. Washes away after about 4 days.</li>
    <li> Works best if you build up a tan instead of trying to create a deep tan in one session.  I am very fair skinned but have built up a nice dark tan and have received many compliments.  Does not look like a spray tan at all!</li>
    <li> After going to a salon and coming out looking so unnatural, I decide to try this product at home.  One of my husbands many skills is spraying things evenly (he is a fabrication specialist for a company that makes products for private aircraft), that along with my dad&#x27;s air compressor and away we went.  It takes some practice, but this is a great product for fair skin.  If you miss an area, it is not that noticable.  The stuff the salon used was so dark that I did not go anywhere until the second day, and as it faded, it looked horrible, that is why I love this solution and am ordering my second batch!</li>
    <li> Great color and natural look with application.  I get many compliments on my \\&quot;tan.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Liked this product but didn&#x27;t like the ocean power booster drops.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all of the positive reviews.  I want to purchase an airbrush system next, but wanted to try the product first.  I applied using spray bottle and gloved hand.  The results were AMAZING!  I am looking forward to looking tanned all summer and letting my friends try it.  I exfoliated first, applied at 8pm at night and showered at 7am the next day.  No streaks, the color is bronzed not orange and I hardly used any of my supply.  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Product arrived quick and did as promised. Gives you a \\&quot;in from the beach\\&quot; glow. Would definitely purchase again. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for well over 12 tans and it&#x27;s great.  It goes on smoothly with the HVLP spray gun and it has a very pleasant smell.  The color is very natural and looks fantastic!  After 10 hours or so, I shower and a bit of the bronzer comes off, but what is left is a very natural looking tan that slowly fades in 7-10 days.  I then exfoliate and start all over.  If you want a light coat with just a hint of color, it&#x27;s perfect, but I have done two coats, a day apart, and it looked as if I had spent two weeks on the beach working on a perfect tan.  It&#x27;s truly the only way to go these days and it has some great natural aloe and other ingredients that help keep the skin looking youthful.  Apply moisturizer twice a day, and you&#x27;ll look fantastic, any time of year!  I live in a rainy climate, so it&#x27;s great when the sun doesn&#x27;t shine for months at a time!</li>
    <li> Seller is reputable and worked with me on a damaged shipment. Also, the clear solution is great for fair skin. I just put it in a mister bottle. It does stain your finger/toe nails, so keep them covered. You make take a couple tries to get good at blending, but the color is very natural. Not sure about the bronzer versions though.</li>
    <li> I have used this on several loyal clients and myself recently and it is a very nice even tan.  There isn&#x27;t a lot of bronzer in it so there isn&#x27;t a huge overspray on the fan or the clients.  I got the 8.5 DHA.  I believe the COQ10 &amp; Hylauronic acid it contains makes my skin and the clients very soft and supple. And it lasts with your regular moisturizing routine.  The price is really good and I got free shipping.</li>
    <li> The color is so natural and has no orange tones - it looks like a natural tan.  I will definitely order this again when my bottle runs out</li>
    <li> I was worried that buying the medium colored tan solution would make me look unnaturally tan, but it works great! I am a believable tan color and the results are very consistent across my body. There are definitely areas of your body that will take the color better than others, so beware of places that are exfoliated less frequently, ex your feet or parts of your hands. The dead skin soaks up the color too well. So after you spray yourself, be sure to give a little scrub to the areas that you would naturally be less tan. Overall, I really like this product, however if I was going to make one recommendation to the company, I would suggest making it smell better. Perhaps something like banana or coconut, something that reminds you of tanning? The current smell isnt&#x27; the  greatest, and it will linger with you even after you shower. If you are tan with this product, you are going to smell a little unusual.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I started using the airbrush system for my tan. I use to love to lay in the sun till I had to get 1 spot on my nose tested and it was Basil Cell. In addition I&#x27;ve had my leg tested twice and it was basil cell too, So now I&#x27;ve got the scar on my leg.I get the mixture for light skin and it turns out to be the most beautiful and natural tan I&#x27;ve ever seen. I get lots of comments about my tan, but nobody knew it was a spray on tan.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this particular brand of spray but I decided to try something a lil different. .. the plus about this is it shows up immediately.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what my review is as yet.  I believe this is the same tanning solution offered with the reputable tanning guns.  But I am having problems getting the color that I am striving for.  Just can&#x27;t seem to get a tanned look after several applications.  However in all fairness, I have not as yet had the opportunity to apply several applications in a row and I am going to keep on trying as I have hopes.</li>
    <li> Great price and leaves a great looking tan!</li>
    <li> Was a bit nervous when I spray tested it on a paper towel because it was RED.  But once on the skin it looked natural and went on smoothly. Would definitely recommend this product to others, even fair skinned like myself.</li>
    <li> I did not receive very good feedback from my clients regarding this solution.  Most preferred the Norvell solution to this one.  Several reported  that this product gave them an orange&#x27;ish look and faded quickly.  I personally didn&#x27;t mind the solution.  It faded on me nicely... not too quick and it faded pretty evenly; however, that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m more fair skinned and this isn&#x27;t a very dark solution.  The after odor is very strong though.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to take a shower!  At the end of the day, regardless of my personal experience with a product I gotta keep my clients happy!</li>
    <li> I have used EVERY tanning solution on the market and I have to say that this is the best!  This product doesnt stink and leaves a really nice golden bronze color.  I will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I bought this tanning liquid with the Paasche TA-SET Airbrush, and I could not be happier with both products.  The color is perfect--like a golden brown and no orange at all.  The medium tanning solution should be fine for every skin tone, and it really gets dark if you do two coats.  You could do three coats if you are already very tan and want to even it out, but I would not recommend it as the two coats I applied to a friend&#x27;s face turned out very dark.  Even with the two coats, it was still realistic looking.  The solution has a pleasant smell, and it does still gets a little darker even after a day.      Be sure to exfoliate well before using and be careful around feet and hands as everyone who has used self-tanner knows.  I did not use a barrier cream on the hands or feet and nothing on the hair, but I was careful around those areas and did only a brief spray in those areas with no problems.  With the Paasche airbrush, you really can control the spray.  I didn&#x27;t cover my hair, and the gray hair above my ears did not turn brown.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is the solution or the airbrush.</li>
    <li> This tanning solution is the most natural looking i&#x27;ve ever used. The first day really does look almost like a sunburn and deep tan. The color is so believable. It feels good and smells good and makes your skin baby soft. This is by far my favorite solution, i&#x27;m done searching.</li>
    <li> Ok but like Ntaural Self Tanner from Thermalabs  better</li>
    <li> The colour is so natural looking I love it. I use it year round. It can be sprayed or painted on. I suggest a foam paint brush</li>
    <li> Great color no bad smell best I have used.  I am blonde with blue eyes and fairly light skin.  Best color for me.</li>
    <li> Love the color! I am super white and this color came out really nice on me! It even makes you look skinnier! My mom loves the color too! I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve ordered this a couple of times and we love the color! it&#x27;s not too orange or goopy so it looks really natural. Will definitely order this again when we run out :)</li>
    <li> the solution looks good the first day or so but after that it definetly has an orange tint. Think I will try another brand next time</li>
    <li> My wife cannot tan due to sun poison so I use this to tan her with a HLVP sprayer.  This products is my favorite because after spraying it just looks as if you were just out of the sun and not like other products we used that look like tan paint.  It makes a great color and us very forgiving if your a novice.  I&#x27;ve been using this about 3 years and she loves it.  With a little practice you can get great results.  Wife looks great so I&#x27;m happy too.</li>
    <li> Tried this solution in a spray tan kit I bought. This is NOT the same solution and has obviously changed for the worse :(.  Sprayed on a weird unnatural looking color and very streaky. I ended up returning it and bought the Norvell brand I had used originally (same solution my mystic tan salon used).  I do not recommend this Ocean solution at all.</li>
    <li> Going to the Salon would cost anywhere from $25-$35 for one spray Tan. The professional tans would always drip and streak because the so called professionals would apply too much solution. As my daughter is a model we need to have this done and the photographers usually are trying to even out the streaks. Having the spray system at home we can do this ourselves and we get much better results. I have her stand in the shower, I have extra lighting, and I spray a even light mist. Each tan uses about 1.5 oz and cost about $2.00 per tan. Don&#x27;t forget to buy the cleaner for your spray unit, it takes about 1 tsp per cleaning for the small unit. Does anyone know what the difference between the 8.5 and the 12.5 medium is?</li>
    <li> Looks natural, isn&#x27;t sticky, really like it</li>
    <li> Love this color, just the right natural color look.  Not too dark so I can continue to spray more on to get a deeper color.</li>
    <li> No weird smell, sprays evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts awhile... Repeat user.</li>
    <li> Been buying and using this for over a year, works good and goes on good. Last about 4 days then needs reapplied.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and I achieved an even natural looking tan.  There is absolutely NO orange color to this product!!! The scent of the product is the best I have ever worked with.  You will not be disappointed.  I purchased this along with the Turbo Tan Deluxe T65 which worked perfectly giving me a very even tan with no splotches or spots!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because i thought the price was fair, i also always look at the reviews and everyone seemed to like it. I think it is awful it is so thin it splats on and i even used a little rolling brush, seeing as though i had to wash it all off the best i could get it off i would not give it one star if i didnt have to,[[ASIN:B001BPRXK8 Ocean Sunless AIRBRUSH TANNING 8.5 DHA Medium Tan SOLUTION QT]] i guess what they all say is true \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and hard to tan, so the sun isn&#x27;t a good idea for me. I tried the sprayer, but it seems like it takes forever to me, so I, like others, used a cotton cloth to apply it. Works great! I look like I&#x27;ve had just enough sun to give some good color. If you&#x27;re looking for a deep tan, you&#x27;ll need to buy the higher DHA product, which I plan on using in the summer.</li>
    <li> I put it on with an airbrush and it still streaked.</li>
    <li> i havent tried but a few others and best results esp in winter with the med 8.5 solution from ocean.</li>
    <li> I love this solution it works very well although it does have a red tint to it which is fine because it looks like you digest got off the beach. The end result is a brown color even on fair skin.</li>
    <li> I like this one it seems to dry faster and not stickey like others that I have tried.  Also the color is good not orange.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell near as bad as all of the others.  Actually smells pretty good.  The color is fantastic.  No orange-ness whatsoever!</li>
    <li> I did not consider this to be a good spray as it is to watery. I do like the color at first but when you take you first shower your skin is streaky and the color has faded.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best sunless tanner I have used.  It looks great.  I am super pale so I was afraid of looking orange but this made me look tan.  I love that the first day you use it, it has a reddish tint so that it kind of looks like a tan with a bit of a sunburn then it turns to a deep tan and looks great.  It has a little smell but not as bad as most products out there.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and the color guide is nice and dark. Easy to see where you&#x27;re spraying. Pretty color right away. Does have that reddish tint like you&#x27;ve just come in out of the sun. The fade is not the best. Do end up looking a little scaley about the 5th day. But the color lasts and the price is great. That dha smell is a little strong on some people. Some don&#x27;t have a problem at all. Must depend on your body chemistry. Great product. I&#x27;ll keep it in stock for my customers.</li>
