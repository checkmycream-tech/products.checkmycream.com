      <li>One With Nature offers plenty of options.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lather is soft and fragrant.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love all the One With Nature soaps, but the rose petal is my favorite scent.  I use One With Nature soaps on a regular basis.  It feels good on my skin and is not drying at all.  I will never use another brand of soap!  Costs a bit more than grocery store soaps, but is well worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I love rose anything, and rose things seem hard to find, so when I found this soap, I wanted to try it.  Rose is my all-time favorite scent.  Most people don&#x27;t like rose scent, so I&#x27;m in the minority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rose scent is not very strong - just enough to be able to slightly smell it.  I think non-rose lovers would like this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is natural, and smells clean and comfortable.  I am a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; person and a \\&quot;soap\\&quot; person and a \\&quot;rose\\&quot; person.  This soap lathers up richly and nicely.  It is pure clean heaven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is soft and gentle on the skin, and does not make my skin itch.  I have very sensitive skin, and lots of soaps cause itching.  This soap has some wonderful natural ingredients that sound soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soothing and comfortable.  Wonderful smell.  Rich, soft lather.  All natural.  Cozy.  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Accurate description. Good communication. Fast delivery. Tried the other scents. This by far smells the best.</li>
    <li> I love this  Rose scented soap.  .this soap lasts a long time and just putting it in my soap dish makes my bathroom smell  lovely.  Purchasing  it from Amazon  was less costly for me, too.</li>
    <li> I love One with Nature Soap and Rose Petal is definitely one of my favorites! Lathers up perfectly and smells good too!</li>
    <li> Excellent job all around- fair price, shipped quickly and packages well. Keep up the good work. Will definitely be buying again for myself and to share as gifts.</li>
    <li> I first found this soap at Whole Foods, tried it , loved it, then looked for it on Amazon. Amazon had the best price by far so I ordered the set of six bars. I am normally not a fan of rose scent as it can be too cloying. This has a wonderful light scent, which, unlike other bars, does not lose it&#x27;s strength like other scented soaps. I repeat, this is a LIGHT scent, you will not walk around smelling like your grandmothers Avon Potpourri! The lather is wonderful and not drying . I live in Albuquerque, so a soap that moisturizes and lathers beautifully is a true find. I will probably use this soap for the rest of my life. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this soap at my local Whole Foods last night.  It smelled so delicious sitting there in the crate, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy one and try it out.  Especially since I&#x27;ve really been trying to stay \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lately.  The ONE bar of soap I bought literally made my entire car smell like soft rose petals.  It was magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I tried the soap out and it works wonderfully.  It suds up well, it lathers well, and smells even more delicious when mixed with my natural oils.  The only problem is, and it may even be my county&#x27;s water, my skin feels like rubber while the soap is washing off my body.  This feeling goes away once I dry off, but while I was in the shower, it literally gave a \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feeling.  I wasn&#x27;t fond of it - or maybe I&#x27;ve been using Victoria&#x27;s Secret body wash for far too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I would suggest this to anyone.  And I can&#x27;t wait to go back to Whole Foods so I can pick up a few of the other scents as well!</li>
    <li> Great soap. The soap came on time, and was packaged well. I will buy this soap again.</li>
    <li> My skin reacts easily to various things including soap.  Several years ago I came across this particular soap and tried it.  It has worked well for me but because we now live in a very rural area, the only place to find it was through Amazon.  Sooooooooooo, now I have this particular soap and all is well.</li>
    <li> Upon opening my package, I was immediately welcomed with the lovely rose petal scent, it filled the room. The soap was also pink, not as displayed in the picture. I liked that fact even better though. I was so excited, I couldn&#x27;t wait to jump into the shower and put it to the test. It gives such a warming feeling, and yet it&#x27;s so fresh.... 6 luxurious soaps for under 23 dollars? You simply can&#x27;t get the quality for that price anywhere else. I will continue to buy this soap for years to come! ♡</li>
    <li> After 17 years of marriage my husband finally asked--&amp;#34;what is that smell--it is great?&amp;#34;  It was this soap!! I will use it forever.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Our soaps combine nourishing dead sea minerals with moisturizing shea butter and argan oil to provide a truly luxurious cleansing experience.\\&quot; ~ One With Nature ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Rose Petal Dead Sea Mineral bar soap at Whole Foods and the makers, One With Nature, truly deliver what they claim about their products. They are \\&quot;therapeutic, luxurious and affordable.\\&quot; These bars of soap are made in Jordan and also available in other scents such as Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Hibiscus, Vanilla Oatmeal, Shea Butter and Lilac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Petal exfoliates, moisturizes and gives the skin extra glow with a smoothness like the petals of a rose. It smells good and lathers well. I have also tried Lavender, Hibiscus and Lilac but my favorite is still the rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients on these bars of soap include saponified palm, shea butter, palm kernel oils, argan oil, vegetable glycerin, dead sea salt, citric acid. Some bars include essential oils, lavender petals, rose petals, plant and mineral pigments, natural fragrance and goat&#x27;s milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with One With Nature bars of soap most specifically Rose Petal. I&#x27;m a satisfied user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wholeheartedly recommended.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both love this soap.  Really makes a difference - leaves your skin soft and clean. I&#x27;m a bit of a soap snob - and this is my favorite. Best price anywhere.</li>
    <li> the soap I received is not the soap described on the website, the color and smell are not the same as the soap I purchased from the same manufacture which you have displayed in the picture and in the description.  The one I received is Rose Petal Triple Milled Soap Argan Oil + Shea Butter.  The most disappointing fact is that it hardly has any rose smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand&#x27;s rose and lemon verbena.  Both are nice big, lather rich soaps at a reasonable price.  The ingredients seem healthy and natural.  I am very satisfied with these soaps, but find the rose petal variety doesn&#x27;t smell much like roses and the scent is a bit too strong for my liking.  Someone else might like this strong scent but I prefer a milder scent that doesn&#x27;t settle on my skin for an extended period as this one does.  That said this is very, very good bar soap.  Scent is a matter of preference.  One With Nature offers plenty of options.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and i think it&#x27;s going to be a hit. Smells real good. Would buy again</li>
    <li> One With Nature Dead Sea Mineral Rose Petal Soap is my most favorite of all soaps! And I have tried them all. The fragrance is a soft  light rose . I would not love it for that reason alone, however. I am comforted to know that it does not contain harmful ingredients. It&#x27;s lather is soft and fragrant. I first discovered it at  the Fairway market on the Upper West Side in Manhattan and when I moved away I located it thankfully on amazon.  Just love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the soaps from one with nature!!! They smell delicious and feel really good on the skin. I Definitely recommend&lt;br /&gt;them. Lavander and Rose are my favorite!!!</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing.  I can&#x27;t use 90 %of the soaps on the market due to sensitive skin.  It works great</li>
    <li> I totally recomend it. Is has a rich lather and smells wonderful. I like so much the aroma, that I put the bits of leftover soap inside my drawers and shelves to perfume my clothing. Since I started doing so, I have not had my cashmere sweaters and cotton shirts eaten away by fabric eating creatures.</li>
    <li> smooth on skin. smells right.&lt;br /&gt;Used 2 of them. no complain.&lt;br /&gt;price is better than purchasing one from stores (like bed bath )</li>
    <li> Love this soap....super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This soap lathers well and makes you feel very clean.  The slightest smell it emits is a pleasant one, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells like roses.</li>
    <li> Natural ingredients, nice lather, just a little bit of exfoliation and a scent to die for! This soap is not overly \\&quot;rosey\\&quot;, it just smells incredibly clean and fresh, it&#x27;s my absolute favorite and I hope they never stop making it!!</li>
    <li> these have great lather. quality soaps for sure</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the One With Nature soap, but we had never tried this fragrance before. I was worried that the fragrance would be too overpowering, but it&#x27;s quite subtle and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this soap.  I shower twice a day and find this soap very moisturizing.  The scent is very appealing.  I store it in my linen cabinet to lightly scent my linens.  Also, the design of the soap with the divot on one side makes it easier to handle when new.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful soap.  The bars are a bit on the larger size but  the rose scent is very nice and it lathers really well.</li>
