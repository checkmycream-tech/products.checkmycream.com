      <li>its been awhile since we used it because of the price, but finding the 2-pack is an awesome deal.</li>
      <li>Great stuff!  </li>
      <li>These drops are awesome  !</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>It smells and tastes great.</li>
      <li>the smell is somewhat pleasant.</li>
      <li>5 stars bit paid good money for drops that just don&#x27;t do the trick..</li>
      <li>good product&lt;</li>
      <li>a nice warming with a great numbing tingle..plus</li>
      <li>My husband and I are very pleased.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34;I have had a lot of sexual experiences throughout my life, but never have I had a woman apply ON to herself in the front seat of my car!  </li>
      <li>sure, why not!?  </li>
      <li>So glad I bought the 2 pak.</li>
      <li>I love that it does not have menthol.</li>
      <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t use too many drops.</li>
      <li>that all I can say just don&#x27;t go more than couple drops at each session.</li>
      <li>it Is good, I started with 2 drops the first time....</li>
      <li>first time I have tried this kind of product.</li>
      <li>Best stuff ever made by human hands to extend the use and magic of human hands.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only did it work very well as a stimulant, but it also has a great, cinnamony smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The mood quickly spread and the rest of the women in the car wanted to get it ON.</li>
      <li>The tingle you feel when you put it on is very intense!</li>
      <li>but when I used it the second time I added 3 and, its even better!</li>
      <li>they do not tell you that they have a higher strength  !</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
      <li>Use only two or three drops, very strong.</li>
      <li>Effects seem to wear off quick, but this isn&#x27;t much concern for me.</li>
      <li>It definitely makes you more sensitive in a good way, definitely improved my sex life!</li>
      <li>Used for first time.</li>
      <li>I want a whole bottle!</li>
      <li>My wife loves this stuff, really works</li>
      <li>Does not wprk very well.</li>
      <li>They really are..</li>
      <li>and I was immediately ready to get to it.  </li>
      <li>My wife is going thru metapause and this stuff really gets her going</li>
      <li>It can be too intense for some women</li>
      <li>Worked well and gave a nice little extra spice to the night.</li>
      <li>It left a very desirable smell in the car, my mouth started to water</li>
      <li>...and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>this product doesn&#x27;t use that menthol crap that most of these enhancer has.&lt;br /&gt;For a woman that like a natural product that make the climax 3 times better.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; for many years.</li>
      <li>Brought a quick orgasm when we only had a few minutes (busy house)!</li>
      <li>Her arousal was apparent.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> She loves it. I wish they sold bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> My gynecologist told me to get Zestra but I decided after researching the different products to get this one instead. So glad I bought the 2 pak. A warming, tingling lasting effect! This product is the best!!</li>
    <li> My biggest complaint about this item is that while I was supposed to receive 2 of this item, I did not and I only received 1 of this item.</li>
    <li> ON is on!  It does what it says! that all I can say just don&#x27;t go more than couple drops at each session.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff, really works and it is HALF the price as in stores.  TRY THIS you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I found On in a random shop on vacation - I figured... sure, why not!?  ...and was pleasantly surprised.  The only other product to work well for me was Zestra, which is amazing, but has a bit of a weird smell [kindof beany? hard to describe].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it work very well as a stimulant, but it also has a great, cinnamony smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  My husband and I are very pleased.  Pun intended.</li>
    <li> Great product! The tingle you feel when you put it on is very intense! Make sure you don&#x27;t use too many drops. It can be too intense for some women but once you &amp; your partner get it on it stops. I only bought a few sample packs at the store &amp; now that I&#x27;ve tried it twice I want a whole bottle!</li>
    <li> first time I have tried this kind of product. it Is good, I started with 2 drops the first time.... but when I used it the second time I added 3 and, its even better!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have had a lot of sexual experiences throughout my life, but never have I had a woman apply ON to herself in the front seat of my car!  It left a very desirable smell in the car, my mouth started to water and I was immediately ready to get to it.  Her arousal was apparent.  The mood quickly spread and the rest of the women in the car wanted to get it ON. The bottle was passed around like a joint.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  I have one in my glove compartment at all times.&amp;#34;  Mario The Stud</li>
    <li> We have used a cream and oil in the past, this did nothing for my wife don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This item produced very little result.  Disappointing when compared to the advertised claims. Not worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever made by human hands to extend the use and magic of human hands. Once you have tried it once ,,,,, it&#x27;s tickets......</li>
    <li> this product doesn&#x27;t use that menthol crap that most of these enhancer has.&lt;br /&gt;For a woman that like a natural product that make the climax 3 times better.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; for many years.</li>
    <li> It definitely makes you more sensitive in a good way, definitely improved my sex life! Use only two or three drops, very strong. Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> good product&lt;br /&gt;it works well but in time&lt;br /&gt;you need patience to massage it in slowly  and patiently&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t do miracles</li>
    <li> Does not wprk very well.</li>
    <li> These drops are awesome  ! They really are.. But not the strength you see here..they do not tell you that they have a higher strength  ! And those are the ones to buy..would have given 5 stars bit paid good money for drops that just don&#x27;t do the trick..But everyone is different..</li>
    <li> My wife loves the feeling of this stuff. its been awhile since we used it because of the price, but finding the 2-pack is an awesome deal. as soon as i put it on the feeling kicks in. a nice warming with a great numbing tingle..plus the smell is somewhat pleasant.</li>
    <li> It definitely creates a tingling feeling! It smells and tastes great. I love that it does not have menthol. It didn&#x27;t help with orgasm for me.</li>
    <li> It doesnt do what it says it does. It makes warmth no tingling! I used three times thinking I needed to get used to it...I wont use it again its a waste!</li>
    <li> My wife is going thru metapause and this stuff really gets her going and the smell is like an aphrodeisiac to me</li>
    <li> Used for first time. Brought a quick orgasm when we only had a few minutes (busy house)! Effects seem to wear off quick, but this isn&#x27;t much concern for me. It gets the party started, and that&#x27;s the hardest step covered.</li>
    <li> Save your money please,this stuff does not work.</li>
    <li> Details are not necessary.  I&#x27;m usually quite skeptical of these products, but the short answer is it works.  every time!  If I could buy stock in this company I would.  online is about half what you would pay in the store, if you can find it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Worked well and gave a nice little extra spice to the night.</li>
