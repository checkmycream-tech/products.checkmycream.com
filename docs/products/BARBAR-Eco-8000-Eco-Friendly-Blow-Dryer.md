### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best blow dryer EVER!</li>
      <li>Works GREAT!</li>
      <li>Plenty of power, heat, and best of all: no radiation!</li>
      <li>In my experience, the heavier dryers also tend to be the best ones.</li>
      <li>So happy I chose this one after searching for the perfect dryer.</li>
      <li>Purchased this for my mom and she loved it!</li>
      <li>this hair dryer worked GREAT for awhile.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all.</li>
      <li>I did not find that fair.</li>
      <li>My Conair dryer still works perfectly so this costly dryer is being picked up by UPS for a free return and refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>know the Trifield meter is good because I&#x27;ve tested it.</li>
      <li>After a weekend of good times, I looked up Barbar and debated which model I wanted.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
      <li>Now I can do my own thing in my room while my mom blow dries her hair without having to worry about the lights going off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The heat is great and the air flow is powerful.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Other than that, the hair dryer works exactly as it should, great heat and air pressure.  </li>
      <li>The electric field is measured using the Electric range on the top scale.  </li>
      <li>Love this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>After reviewing many hairdryers I went with this based on the product description and the reviews.</li>
      <li>, I ordered it on a Tuesday and received it the next day, which was awesome.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m using the 0-100mG range and reading the top scale for the electromagnetic field measurement.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>When calling barbar they started out very friendly.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know if this one does quite as good a job as the red one, but I&#x27;ve been happy with it in that it does a professional-level job of drying my hair in a reasonable period of time (though I don&#x27;t know if it would be quite as good without the included funnel attachment).</li>
      <li>This works fine, and I sure hope it is Eco-friendly as advertised.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good item; a little noisy and it takes a while to warm up, but that&#x27;s probably the nature of the ceramic dryer.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice, solid build and feels like a good quality piece of machinery.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fine for me, but I would not like to hold it for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not too noisy, and that is important to me.  </li>
      <li>It was compact and did a great job of drying my hair quickly without causing any apparent damage.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;The ECO8000 blows clean heat, which is heat without radiation.  </li>
      <li>Luckily the client was uninjured or else that would of been a huge liability.</li>
      <li>This one is pure ceramic ugh love it.</li>
      <li>It weighs as much as our older foldable drier and is actually a good weight for its size.</li>
      <li>The Barbar ECO8000 beats the T3 by at least a country mile as the best dryer ever.</li>
      <li>Most people do not realize how much electromagnetic radiation</li>
      <li>(my husband timed me :-P)  to dry my hair</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a YouTube video on this dryer that proves it&#x27;s eco friendly.  </li>
      <li>By itself, it&#x27;s a 4 star dryer; however, I dropped my rating down to 3 stars because I have experienced issues with product</li>
      <li>For us its an improvement over the previous and we&#x27;re happy about that.</li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s less radiation alone makes it great.</li>
      <li>Worse customer service I ever experienced!</li>
      <li>When my daughter had enough hair to need to use a hair-dryer I could not in good conscience allow her to be exposed to that much radiation, which is why I went online to see if there were alternatives.</li>
      <li>with the old blow drier our electricity would turn off if the kitchen light and room light were on simultaneously, with the Barbar ECO</li>
      <li>When I first turned it on, it emitted a mild odor</li>
      <li>I got my hair cut right before I got it and have not had it cut since</li>
      <li>Most important is energy efficiency, and as long as it delivers that I will put up with the weight and color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good dryer, but to experience two different defects on two brand new units within 90 days is a concern for me.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t repeat all the great things about it other than what I have already written about the aspects of radiation, but it does indeed live up to the hype.</li>
      <li>You may have just spenT a lot more money for dryer that is no different EMF wise than a traditional hair dryer.nT a lot more money for dryer that is no different EMF wise than a traditional hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Thanks Hubby! &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>The hair dryer I received is the exact model advertised.  </li>
      <li>and I never feel like it got hot</li>
      <li>would go with a babyliss - very realiable and worth the money</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the lack of deadly radiation, but my Barbar also gives me the best blow dry</li>
      <li>It caused the meter to peg, so I can&#x27;t tell you how strong the EMF&#x27;s actually are.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fold up so it is too large for me to store in my bathroom.</li>
      <li>Very high quality product.  </li>
      <li>I love this dryer because it dries quickly and isn&#x27;t as loud as a lot of other dryers.</li>
      <li>Better than I expected.</li>
      <li>The Barbar is one of those rare products that completely met my expectations.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While it does the job and is relatively quick drying my hair, a couple of initial items I noticed: it&#x27;s somewhat heavy, doesn&#x27;t get super hot (which is probably a good thing) and the buttons to control the intensity/heat are on the side of the handle in the form of flat toggles.</li>
      <li>Spend the extra money, this blow dryer tops all of them and is completely worth it!</li>
      <li>then the previous one and makes a clean sound of wind passing through than our old one which sounded like a vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is also a green indicator light that shines right in my eyes as I use it.</li>
      <li>price too high.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item because I appreciate the environmentally friendly aspect of this blow-dryer, and I hope it lasts me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think many people would stand with their head right next to a microwave oven while it was operating, but the amount of radiation you are exposed to from a typical hair-dryer is quite comparable.</li>
      <li>It blows well, gets nice and hot and it takes me less time to dry than my Conair...</li>
      <li>it does not which proves it is actually energy efficient.</li>
      <li>My new dryer was fully functioning, but after about 3 months of use the buttons on the fuse in the plug broke; nothing happens when the test/reset buttons are pressed, but the dryer itself still works.</li>
      <li>I realize this is seen in the photo, but I didn&#x27;t realize until I actually used it that if you are right handed, your thumb/fingers/hand essentially has to lay over the controls, which is pretty uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This hairdryer&#x27;s levels were almost twice as high as my 8 year old hair dryer....</li>
      <li>I had never heard of Barbar until I was staying at a newly built resort with friends and fell in love with the little red Barbar dryer in our suite.</li>
      <li>This really is the only &amp;#34;natural one&amp;#34; the others are just the metal but coated in ceramic.</li>
      <li>The supervisor John then proceeded to get loud with me and hung up on me.</li>
      <li>My cousin received a call from the supervisor  advising that it was normal wear and tear and the only compensation would be a new hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I would not purchase this model again, but would still give Barbar one last chance (3rd time&#x27;s the charm, right?).</li>
      <li>When it worked, you could feel the cool air mixed in with the hot air, so just the center was warm and surrounded by cold.</li>
      <li>With 1,100 watts of power, equivalent in heat and blowing power to a standard 1,800 watt blow dryer, you can be health conscious without sacrificing performance.</li>
      <li>My first one lasted about 2.5 years with average use.</li>
      <li>The one I replaced was small, light-weight, folded in half, and was very easy to handle and operate.</li>

<li> Because it was less than 30 days old, I wanted to exchange it rather than pursue a warranty replacement through the manufacturer.</li>
<li> The smell went away almost instantly and I started to blow dry my hair.</li>
<li> cord is unnecessarily long.  </li>
<li> She says it actually does generate the same amount of heat as her previous blow drier with a spiral heating system and that it does not burn her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If I use the cooler setting it takes a long time to dry my hair.</li>
<li> , my hair is very long and medium thickness.</li>
<li> a typical hair-dryer puts out, and to make matters worse, this radiation is usually right next to your head.</li>
<li> This hair dryer is large, heavy and difficult for me to hold far enough from my head to avoid burning my scalp.</li>
<li> Then a few days later, lights would come on but no air.</li>
<li> Recommend for anyone with wet soggy hair..</li>
<li> So even though I had just dropped $150 on this dryer, I was forced to pay an extra 20 bucks a month later because the product was defective.</li>
<li> I first received my ECO8000, the heating element died (accompanied by a burning smell) within 30 days and it would only blow cold air (regardless of what setting it was at).</li>
<li> /&gt;It has a long cable about 5 or 6 ft which gives it plenty of length to be operated around a person and is not THATT heavy.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not bully like other reviews have mentioned.</li>
<li> compared it to my other hair dryer, the Conair IonShine 1875 model which puts out 1875 Watts.  </li>
<li> This blow drier is also much less noisy</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The hair dryer I received is the exact model advertised.  However, it is putting out well over the 100mG  according to the Trifield Meter 100XE EMF Meter I bough at Amazon.com.  It caused the meter to peg, so I can&#x27;t tell you how strong the EMF&#x27;s actually are.  The meter  scale doesn&#x27;t go that high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is contrary to what is advertised: &amp;#34;The ECO8000 emits 4.1 mG of EMF.&amp;#34;  100mG of EMF&#x27;s is what my head would be receiving if I used this dryer.  In addition, even 3 feet away from the dryer emits about 38mG.  And using the Trifield meter to measure the electric field, there is also an electric field 60-70 volts A/C  in the air 3 feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the Trifield meter is good because I&#x27;ve tested it. And I&#x27;m using the 0-100mG range and reading the top scale for the electromagnetic field measurement.  There is no mistake in the reading.  The electric field is measured using the Electric range on the top scale.  Again,  no mistakie in the reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared it to my other hair dryer, the Conair IonShine 1875 model which puts out 1875 Watts.  The readings are virtually identical, again conrtrary to the advertisement:.  &amp;#34;The ECO8000 blows clean heat, which is heat without radiation.  With 1,100 watts of power, equivalent in heat and blowing power to a standard 1,800 watt blow dryer, you can be health conscious without sacrificing performance. &amp;#34;  Not True.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the hair dryer works exactly as it should, great heat and air pressure.  But I bought this  hair dryer because of the advertised low EMF&#x27;s.  My Conair dryer still works perfectly so this costly dryer is being picked up by UPS for a free return and refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is for you if you are thinking of buying this hair dryer because of the advertised low EMF&#x27;s,  If you cannot measure the dryer, and you are not electrically hypersensitive so cannot feel the EMF&#x27;s your hair dryer generates,  you won&#x27;t know difference.  You may have just spenT a lot more money for dryer that is no different EMF wise than a traditional hair dryer.nT a lot more money for dryer that is no different EMF wise than a traditional hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Failed early on, but Barbar replaced without hassle. Works GREAT!</li>
    <li> The Barbar ECO8000 beats the T3 by at least a country mile as the best dryer ever. My T3 began to lose power one day then literally sparked in my hand and almost caught fire, about a month or so after the warranty expired. Maybe it&#x27;s the lack of deadly radiation, but my Barbar also gives me the best blow dry I have ever had. I wish my stylist would use a Barbar. The Barbar is one of those rare products that completely met my expectations.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a YouTube video on this dryer that proves it&#x27;s eco friendly.  The heat is great and the air flow is powerful.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I appreciate the environmentally friendly aspect of this blow-dryer, and I hope it lasts me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does the job and is relatively quick drying my hair, a couple of initial items I noticed: it&#x27;s somewhat heavy, doesn&#x27;t get super hot (which is probably a good thing) and the buttons to control the intensity/heat are on the side of the handle in the form of flat toggles.

    <li> It is the weakest hair dryer I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> controls are in an awkward position that interfers with hand grip position and are hard to read.  cord is unnecessarily long.  price too high.</li>
    <li> My cousin purchased a barbar hair dryer. While working on a client the blow dryer sparked and caught fire leave my cousin with a nasty permanent burn. Luckily the client was uninjured or else that would of been a huge liability. When calling barbar they started out very friendly. They requested the blow dryer be shipped to them for review (we had to pay for the shipping). My cousin received a call from the supervisor  advising that it was normal wear and tear and the only compensation would be a new hair dryer. However, we would have to pay the shipping and handling. I did not find that fair. The supervisor John then proceeded to get loud with me and hung up on me. Worse customer service I ever experienced!</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A LOW EMF hairdryer. This hairdryer&#x27;s levels were almost twice as high as my 8 year old hair dryer....Also smelled pretty bad when turned on</li>
    <li> I had never heard of Barbar until I was staying at a newly built resort with friends and fell in love with the little red Barbar dryer in our suite. It was compact and did a great job of drying my hair quickly without causing any apparent damage. After a weekend of good times, I looked up Barbar and debated which model I wanted. I settled on the Eco model because it had a ceramic heating element and it claims to have lower radiation levels than a standard dryer (I have not researched this or otherwise put it to the test).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this one does quite as good a job as the red one, but I&#x27;ve been happy with it in that it does a professional-level job of drying my hair in a reasonable period of time (though I don&#x27;t know if it would be quite as good without the included funnel attachment). I agree with some other reviewers in that the controls are a little awkwardly placed and the unit is a little on the heavy side, but I&#x27;ve found you get used to the switch placement as well as the weight. In my experience, the heavier dryers also tend to be the best ones. By itself, it&#x27;s a 4 star dryer; however, I dropped my rating down to 3 stars because I have experienced issues with product quality.&lt;br /&gt;When I first received my ECO8000, the heating element died (accompanied by a burning smell) within 30 days and it would only blow cold air (regardless of what setting it was at). Because it was less than 30 days old, I wanted to exchange it rather than pursue a warranty replacement through the manufacturer. I had ordered it through Amazon but, because it had been fulfilled by Folica, the return had to be done through them. I had to contact them twice before they replied, and they made me pay for shipping on the return. So even though I had just dropped $150 on this dryer, I was forced to pay an extra 20 bucks a month later because the product was defective. I sucked it up and paid the money because I didn&#x27;t have the time to dispute it with them, but I feel like that&#x27;s a bad way to do business. My new dryer was fully functioning, but after about 3 months of use the buttons on the fuse in the plug broke; nothing happens when the test/reset buttons are pressed, but the dryer itself still works. It&#x27;s been working for about a year and a half, but I&#x27;m concerned that the thermal fuse is not functional (because the test/reset buttons are broken) and as a result it may, at some point, present a safety hazard. Because of this, I never leave the dryer plugged in when I&#x27;m done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good dryer, but to experience two different defects on two brand new units within 90 days is a concern for me. I would not purchase this model again, but would still give Barbar one last chance (3rd time&#x27;s the charm, right?). Unless something else catches my eye, I think the next dryer will probably be a Barbar Italy 3800. I would rate Folica as one or two stars, but this is not the forum for that.</li>
    <li> After reviewing many hairdryers I went with this based on the product description and the reviews. After 4 months it has now stopped working and only blows cold air out so I just wasted basically $120. Also, it is really heavy and I never feel like it got hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;I would go with a babyliss - very realiable and worth the money</li>
    <li> For a hair dryer that cost $120+ it should not stop working properly after just over 4 months.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer. The fact that it&#x27;s less radiation alone makes it great. It isn&#x27;t hard to hold and it&#x27;s not bully like other reviews have mentioned. It is such a quality product and works greaaaat. So happy I chose this one after searching for the perfect dryer. This really is the only &amp;#34;natural one&amp;#34; the others are just the metal but coated in ceramic. This one is pure ceramic ugh love it. Buy it!</li>
    <li> When it worked, you could feel the cool air mixed in with the hot air, so just the center was warm and surrounded by cold. Then a few days later, lights would come on but no air. Wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all. Amazon refunded money before we even shipped it back. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with the design of this hair dryer. The one I replaced was small, light-weight, folded in half, and was very easy to handle and operate. This hair dryer is large, heavy and difficult for me to hold far enough from my head to avoid burning my scalp. If I use the cooler setting it takes a long time to dry my hair. There is also a green indicator light that shines right in my eyes as I use it. It doesn&#x27;t fold up so it is too large for me to store in my bathroom. The only thing I like about this hair dryer is that I know it is healthier for me and the environment.</li>
    <li> Every time I go out of town and use someone else&#x27;s dryer I&#x27;m late for my events because I&#x27;m used to it taking so little time to dry my hair at home with this thing and the dryers I use at whoever&#x27;s house take FOREVER. I&#x27;ve been spoiled by my Barbar Eco!</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. Wish I had bought it sooner. Plenty of power, heat, and best of all: no radiation!</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer EVER! My husband bought this for me for christmas, I&#x27;ve had it now for almost 4months. I didn&#x27;t want to do a review until I had used it for a few months. &#x27;t does the job without leaving my hair dried out and brittle and I have noticed less of my hair in the sink when I am done blow drying. I got my hair cut right before I got it and have not had it cut since, I have hardly any split ends. My husband loves it because it uses less electricity. Spend the extra money, this blow dryer tops all of them and is completely worth it! I use it on low heat and low air, it takes me about 8 minutes (my husband timed me :-P)  to dry my hair, my hair is very long and medium thickness. Thanks Hubby! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mom and she loved it! She says it actually does generate the same amount of heat as her previous blow drier with a spiral heating system and that it does not burn her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older spiral blow dryer produced a nasty smell every-time it was being used and this one has no smell. This blow drier is also much less noisy then the previous one and makes a clean sound of wind passing through than our old one which sounded like a vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also with the old blow drier our electricity would turn off if the kitchen light and room light were on simultaneously, with the Barbar ECO it does not which proves it is actually energy efficient. Now I can do my own thing in my room while my mom blow dries her hair without having to worry about the lights going off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a long cable about 5 or 6 ft which gives it plenty of length to be operated around a person and is not THATT heavy. It weighs as much as our older foldable drier and is actually a good weight for its size. For us its an improvement over the previous and we&#x27;re happy about that.</li>
    <li> This works fine, and I sure hope it is Eco-friendly as advertised. Sort of an ugly color.  I have really short hair so it&#x27;s fine for me, but I would not like to hold it for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too noisy, and that is important to me.  Most important is energy efficiency, and as long as it delivers that I will put up with the weight and color.</li>
    <li> this hair dryer worked GREAT for awhile. After 18 uses, it only blows out cold air. I bought this through &amp;#34;e-wholesaler&amp;#34; via Amazon, and go figure, they can&#x27;t help me because they are just an overstock wholesaler and they have a 30 day return policy. Never buy this product.</li>
    <li> Like everything about it.  Very high quality product.  Dries faster, leave hair softer.  Recommend for anyone with wet soggy hair..</li>
    <li> We like this blow dryer</li>
    <li> This is my second dryer of this brand and model. My first one lasted about 2.5 years with average use. I love this dryer because it dries quickly and isn&#x27;t as loud as a lot of other dryers. Also like that it has a ceramic heating element. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good item; a little noisy and it takes a while to warm up, but that&#x27;s probably the nature of the ceramic dryer.</li>
    <li> Most people do not realize how much electromagnetic radiation a typical hair-dryer puts out, and to make matters worse, this radiation is usually right next to your head. I don&#x27;t think many people would stand with their head right next to a microwave oven while it was operating, but the amount of radiation you are exposed to from a typical hair-dryer is quite comparable. When my daughter had enough hair to need to use a hair-dryer I could not in good conscience allow her to be exposed to that much radiation, which is why I went online to see if there were alternatives. This Barbar dryer I bought entirely based upon reviews, and it has definitely lived up to its reputation. I won&#x27;t repeat all the great things about it other than what I have already written about the aspects of radiation, but it does indeed live up to the hype. It also has a nice, solid build and feels like a good quality piece of machinery.</li>
    <li> I bought the dryer because I wanted something that didn&#x27;t put out all the radiation. When I first turned it on, it emitted a mild odor and I thought there was something wrong with it. The smell went away almost instantly and I started to blow dry my hair. It&#x27;s fantastic! It blows well, gets nice and hot and it takes me less time to dry than my Conair...that&#x27;s for sure! I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
