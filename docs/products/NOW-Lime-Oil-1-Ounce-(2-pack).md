      <li>Distilled lime oil smells like a lime popsicille- very sweet and one-note.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice oil as far as I can tell!</li>

      <li>Good quality, strong smell, you don&#x27;t have to use much of it to make it work.</li>
      <li>and we really are enjoying it!</li>
      <li>A great essential oil</li>
      <li>I have been happy with the purity, consistency, and fragrance of their essential oils.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of fresh cut limes and this smells like commercialized \\&quot;lime\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Others are the good old fashion Lampe Berger vessels.  </li>
      <li>My customers love .. is what differentiates the packaging, mostly came very well packed ..</li>
      <li>I love to use this oil or sometimes lemon grass along with my peppermint oil in my diffuser...makes the house smell fresh and clean, and it helps keep me alert as well.</li>
      <li>a somewhat pleasant scent, if you like lime lollipops :) still usable, just not real.</li>
      <li>It is reasonably priced and the next best thing to the scent of freshly peeled lime.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying some it in some Vermont Soaps unscented shower gel next since Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soaps are very thin/runny and leave incredible soap films all over the shower.</li>
      <li>Good, lasting scent.  </li>
      <li>Now, I have a chest full of Lampe Berger oils that I do not use, because they seem either washed out or too sweet and mamby</li>
      <li>Just as described and quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>Non-invasive fresh scent</li>
      <li>Worth it.</li>
      <li>I like a fresh smell, so</li>
      <li>Disinfects, cleans and smells so fresh.  </li>
      <li>Good product not much to say about it, I would recommend to a friend!</li>
      <li>Nothing at all like fresh limes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had GREAT luck with NOW oils in the past, however I do not recommend lime oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
      <li>The other Now Foods essential oils are spot on and are very good, but like just doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.</li>
      <li>It has a pretty strong smell and the liquid is clear</li>
      <li>Lime is my favorite and one of the hardest to get (my local stores don&#x27;t carry it).</li>
      <li>Now is one of the oil brands I trust &amp; love next to dotera</li>
      <li>Just make sure when buying you get 100% essential oils.</li>
      <li>Only thing that I believe could improve NOW lime oil is to cold-express it instead of distilling, which somehow changes the scent a bit, to make it more like candy, as some have mentioned.</li>
      <li>great, long lasting scent for soap making.</li>
      <li>I love Now Foods Essential Oils.</li>
      <li>My wife loves these oils and we will be buying more in the future.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I had wanted.</li>
      <li>The lime scent mixes well with other citrus oils for a nice but not overpowering smell.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s too much.  </li>
      <li>Now I just need to find a seller who will ship it in a reasonable time frame...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a newbie to essential oils and am using them primarily to make body butter.  </li>
      <li>Using this mixed with olive oil as a light perfume.  </li>
      <li>This is very limey - smells a bit like a lime-cycle (sp?).  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of a Lime scent.</li>
      <li>Each oil is authentic, long lasting, and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>And, like other citrus it seems to work best when mixed with other scents.</li>
      <li>and it totally works with my general allergies to most floral and chemically based fragrances.</li>
      <li>I love essential oils and making different</li>
      <li>anyone recommend one that actually smells like a fresh cut lime?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have the sweet lime aroma that I have become accustomed to from more expensive brands such as Fabulous Frannie.</li>
      <li>Some other high quality manufacturers use pressed lime oil - well worth the difference!</li>
      <li>, the seller should be more careful and check the packaging and see if this does not open ...</li>
      <li>They use natural and high quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>Only once had a problem, and one of them came pouring perfumed the whole box, but nothing else, not stop buying ...</li>
      <li>They are extremely strong and can be a little overpowering if you are not careful.</li>
      <li>They smell pretty much the same as essential oils from the more expensive companies.</li>

<ol>
    <li> great, long lasting scent for soap making.</li>
    <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
    <li> Good product not much to say about it, I would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t compare this with other lime essential oils ... I&#x27;m a newbie to essential oils and am using them primarily to make body butter.  You need to use a LOT of this in a body butter to get the scent to stick. And, like other citrus it seems to work best when mixed with other scents. Smells GREAT applied directly to the skin though .. and doesn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the scent of lime and plan to use it for more experiments. This is a very nice oil as far as I can tell!</li>
    <li> I have several aromatherapy vessels:  Some are the newer type vessels that work by boiling water and creating vapor.  Others are the good old fashion Lampe Berger vessels.  I got several of the Now Foods oils to augment the Lampe Berger oils.  I really happy with my choices and my purchases.  And now that I&#x27;ve tried some, I&#x27;m eager to buy some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a Lampe Berger and buy their oils, maybe you can relate to this:  I go into the retail store that carries all the fragrances, spend time smelling the testers, buy a few bottles.  When I try them out at home, the oils never smell like the testers!  Now, I have a chest full of Lampe Berger oils that I do not use, because they seem either washed out or too sweet and mamby-pamby.  I have a lot of money tied up in those oils just sitting in that chest.....  What to do?  Surely, not dump them!  So I decided to give the Lampe Berger oils a helping hand.  I like a fresh smell, so I have taken the Lampe Berger Eucalyptus and added drops of the the Now Foods &amp;#34;Clear the Air&amp;#34; blend.  I now have a fragrance I like.  When I decided I had enough of the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; fragrance, I added a few drops of this Lime Oil.  It made just a subtle difference; toned down the coolness of the &amp;#34;Clear the Air&amp;#34;, and added a touch of sweet citrus.</li>
    <li> Smells like a lime lollipop. Nothing at all like fresh limes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had GREAT luck with NOW oils in the past, however I do not recommend lime oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a somewhat pleasant scent, if you like lime lollipops :) still usable, just not real.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the manufacturer used the distillation method to extract the lime oil instead of using the oil from pressed limes.  There is a world of difference.  Distilled lime oil smells like a lime popsicille- very sweet and one-note. Not fresh at all.  Some other high quality manufacturers use pressed lime oil - well worth the difference!</li>
    <li> Just as described and quick delivery.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Great pricing and shipping! I would  buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> To me, it has the fake lime flavor even though it&#x27;s made from limes.  I guess the taste wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in seltzer water and a drop or two will do you, any more and it&#x27;s too much.  In retrospect I shouldn&#x27;t have ordered the two pack.  One of these, given the taste, will last years.  Gave the other one away and that person will be using it in cleaning sprays.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Exactly what I had wanted.</li>
    <li> I use this in home made cleaning supplies and sprays.  I don&#x27;t use it for internal use at all.  Unfortunately from everything I have read there is no FDA regulations on essential oils and therefore there is no guarrentee your getting 100% even though the bottles say it.  I am by no means saying that this product is not 100% or good quality.  It has a pretty strong smell and the liquid is clear so it works great for my needs.  I would recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews have said, this stuff smells like lime popsicles :(  I brought this from a local health food store and I don&#x27;t care for the taste of it. I will try to find another use for this.</li>
    <li> Added a bit of it to some Dr. Bronner&#x27;s unscented baby soap and no longer have to order my favorite lime shower gel from the UK. Not sure why lime shower gel (or even bar soap) isn&#x27;t sold in the US, but I&#x27;ve search high and now and can&#x27;t find any. I&#x27;m trying some it in some Vermont Soaps unscented shower gel next since Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soaps are very thin/runny and leave incredible soap films all over the shower. I suspect Vermont soaps will have the same soap film problem since ingredients look similar but am hoping for a thicker formulation.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this aroma!!</li>
    <li> Smells like a green Skittle! I use these oils in my homemade beauty products &amp; they are great!</li>
    <li> The lime smells wonderful! The lime scent mixes well with other citrus oils for a nice but not overpowering smell. Thank You</li>
    <li> I love to use this oil or sometimes lemon grass along with my peppermint oil in my diffuser...makes the house smell fresh and clean, and it helps keep me alert as well.</li>
    <li> arrived as promised - was not as described - bottle cap was not sealed on outside bottle nor was there a safety seal on the inside.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the smell.  I love the smell of fresh cut limes and this smells like commercialized \\&quot;lime\\&quot;.  Too bad I just purchased two big bottles :(  I will be buying another brand-anyone recommend one that actually smells like a fresh cut lime?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****update: I did purchase Edens Gardens \\&quot;Lime\\&quot; and it is worlds better than this junk!  I read that another company cold presses their citrus so I will purchase that soon to compare and will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****update2:  I purchased the cold pressed version and honestly I prefer the one from Edens Garden.  It has a more mellow lime smell.</li>
    <li> Good quality, strong smell, you don&#x27;t have to use much of it to make it work. I recommended. Worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at an excellent price!</li>
    <li> I love the scent.  It is reasonably priced and the next best thing to the scent of freshly peeled lime.</li>
    <li> Great deal, great smell and we really are enjoying it!</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this oil.  I love it, I mix it with a little lemon and dab it on as a fragrance.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Somewhat hard to find, so I was thrilled!  :D</li>
    <li> Almost all of my essence oils are from NOW Foods. They use natural and high quality ingredients. Each oil is authentic, long lasting, and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great for soap making?,</li>
    <li> I buy essential oils to work on my SPA ... I met this brand when I was in New York City and loved it, everyone who bought me very pleased ... My customers love .. is what differentiates the packaging, mostly came very well packed .. Only once had a problem, and one of them came pouring perfumed the whole box, but nothing else, not stop buying ... this was leaked but the smell of it is very good, the seller should be more careful and check the packaging and see if this does not open ...</li>
    <li> My wife loves these oils and we will be buying more in the future.  They are extremely strong and can be a little overpowering if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> I use Now essential oils to make cold processed soaps. I have been very happy with all my oils from Now. They smell pretty much the same as essential oils from the more expensive companies. I will continue purchasing Now essential oils for my soaps in the future. I have been happy with the purity, consistency, and fragrance of their essential oils. The lime oil has a particularly nice, sweet, citrusy smell.</li>
    <li> very good value but more of a sweet lime scent..not what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Using this mixed with olive oil as a light perfume.  Non-invasive fresh scent and it totally works with my general allergies to most floral and chemically based fragrances.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  I am a hobbyist soap maker, and this aroma was great.</li>
    <li> Now has the best oils out there. Just make sure when buying you get 100% essential oils. Love the scent in my soaps.</li>
    <li> I love essential oils and making different crafts/ soaps/ scrubs with them.  Very nicely scented and of good quality.</li>
    <li> Disinfects, cleans and smells so fresh.  I use it in dish detergent, laundry detergent and household cleaning products.  Versatile and lasts a long long time.  Gret product.</li>
    <li> I love Now Foods Essential Oils. Lime is my favorite and one of the hardest to get (my local stores don&#x27;t carry it). Only thing that I believe could improve NOW lime oil is to cold-express it instead of distilling, which somehow changes the scent a bit, to make it more like candy, as some have mentioned. However, it appears to be a lot cheaper to distill it, so I&#x27;ll take the SLIGHTLY sub-par quality over having to pay 3x the price. Now I just need to find a seller who will ship it in a reasonable time frame...Or else plan 3 weeks ahead!</li>
    <li> This is very limey - smells a bit like a lime-cycle (sp?).  Works well though and smell lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying citrus essential oils to add to my carbonated water. I kind of mimics La Croix. Lime was very disappointing because it smells and tastes like a fresh pack of Lifesavers candy. The other Now Foods essential oils are spot on and are very good, but like just doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.</li>
    <li> I use it for my puppy room. Not overwhelming. Just effective</li>
    <li> A great essential oil</li>
    <li> I use for homemade laundry rinse, homemade scented &amp;#34;gels,&amp;#34; and looking for more ways to use this delicious scent! (the requirements for submitting feedback are ridiculous!  If you want my comments, and you seem to because of the incessant emails I get that ask for feedback, you&#x27;ll accept what I write or you won&#x27;t get them at all!!!!!)</li>
    <li> I purchased a 2 pack and they both smell stale. They don&#x27;t have the sweet lime aroma that I have become accustomed to from more expensive brands such as Fabulous Frannie. Usually I like Now Foods essential oils. Most of the oils that I use for aromatherapy are Now Foods brand because they have great prices and good quality, but this lime oil is unsatisfactory. I would have thought it was just a bad batch but both bottles smell the same. Maybe they have both been sitting on a shelf somewhere for too long.</li>
    <li> This oil is all that I hoped for.  I had tried lime oil of a different brand from my mother while visiting.  She uses a few drops in her water to aid in digestion.  I found that lime oil also give me a big pick-me-up when a few drops are placed near me.  I put it on my shirt collar, but placed on a cotton ball works well too.  The quality and intensity are all I was looking for.  I deffinatly recommend this company and oil to any and everyone.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of lime. I use this EO in my homemade beauty and cleaning products. This one is yummy! Very happy with my NOW Lime Essential Oil.</li>
    <li> I use this in a bath salt mixture I made and it was perfect.  Now is one of the oil brands I trust &amp; love next to dotera and it isn&#x27;t as expensive.</li>
    <li> I use this in one of my oil combos for my key lime lye soap recipe!</li>
    <li> Love how this smells!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much of a Lime scent. I&#x27;m using it anyway to tame the Patchouli scent, it at least does that. Makes the scent for my husbands favorite shaving oil.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for to make shaving soap.  Good, lasting scent.  Recommended for soap making.</li>
