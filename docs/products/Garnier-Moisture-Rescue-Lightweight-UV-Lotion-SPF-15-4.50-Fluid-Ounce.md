<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Feels great on your skin. Absorbs quickly and is a good base before foundation. I was so glad to be able to find it here. This particular type is no longer being made by Garnier. I could not find it in any store.</li>
    <li> I love Garnier skin products, and use one of their heavier skin creams in cold weather but wanted something lighter for summer and this lotion fits the bill perfectly.  It works well, it&#x27;s moisturizing, but light and non-greasy and it has a lovely scent.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. When I noticed I couldn&#x27;t get it in the stores anymore, I contacted Garnier to find out why. It was discontinued. I am writing this review for two reasons: First to let other fans of this product know that you can no longer get it in stores and it will likely run out online soon. Second to caution users from trusting the SPF listed on the label. Many doctors recommend replacing sunscreen annually as the protection decreases over time as the ingredients degrade. This item has not been produced by Garnier for many months so it is unlikely the sunscreen portion of the moisturizer is providing full protection. While I love this moisturizer and will continue to use it while I can, I am using a secondary sunscreen to protect my face from sun damage and would suggest others to do the same.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember having such a wonderful experience. I haven&#x27;t bought it again after my first purchase. I guess it was okay.</li>
    <li> I tend to have really oily skin, and have been on a long quest for skin products that could help me out with that.  I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer in the morning after washing my face every day for almost two weeks, and I LOVE it.  Even at the end of the day, my skin just isn&#x27;t really oily at all!  I strongly recommend it, and will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Having fair skin and acne prone skin, I have used just about every cheap oil free SPF moisturizer on the market. Most leave a residue or shine that interferes with makeup, and some of them clogged my pores or caused irritation. It&#x27;s like a film that sits on top of the skin, bleh. Now I have used expensive products that work, but I&#x27;m on a tight budget these days. This bottle is a godsend. Not only does it work, it lasts FOREVER.(I also recommend the Garnier gel as well, this for day and the gel for night.)  This stuff soaks in quickly, leaving a natural soft feel, has SPF, and does not cause breakouts or irritation. (I&#x27;m looking at you, Neutrogena and Clean and Clear!) This also actually moisturizes. The smell is mild and pleasant. And it&#x27;s affordable...after two months my bottle has shown no signs of slowing down. This SPF moisturizer should work for just about anybody...let&#x27;s hope this stays on the market, folks! Wearing an SPF in the daytime is very important!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t expect the bottle to be big but it is. I had bought 2 and have been using one and its still full. The product itself is great. It&#x27;s not oily at all, or sticky and does not feel heavy.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an ok cream . I compared it with Aveeno, and this last one was better, but still do the work</li>
    <li> Wonderful very moisturizing lotion with SP15 as promised. Lasts easy for 24 hrs. In a Beauty Salon the owner asked me what I was using to be so \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;. Can recommend it sincerely.</li>
    <li> Gives you a feeling of freshness, this is a very nice lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I wish though it had more spf, 15 isn&#x27;t enough against the summer sun.:)</li>
    <li> I bought this with out even knowing anything about it but i always use Garnier for my hair and ive tried some skin products from them before so anyways i got it and it seemed very nice with a big bottle and everything because usually when you buy a facial moisturizer they come in little bottles and if its a good one that work it can get expensive if you have to moisturize a lot so that was a plus so when i tried it it was great the smell is pleasant and it isn&#x27;t overwhelming and it did exactly what it said in that it made my face feel soft and supple and it wasnt greasy or anything but it was still able to keep my face from being tight and it also was able to cover up any flakes i had because i had ran out of my other moisturizer and my face was all dried up and just not looking great but after only a few days my face was nice and smooth and i think it also helped to get rid of the dried up flakes as well and my skin is oily so it also didst make my for head look to oily after i washed my face and put it on i wont say that it was like a matte finish and ive used mattifying lotions before and then never kept me matte through the day and it also was hard to get fully moisturized but with this one its great because i put it on and im good to go i would definitely say try this especially if you have dried up skin or something like that it will work great</li>
    <li> For any pregnant women out there who are suffering from the rare and dreadful PUPPS rash, look no further! This lotion reduced the itching on contact and within 3 weeks the rash was gone. I tried all of the remedies out there and this is the only thing that worked. I was running out of options and I was miserable so I started trying all the lotions I already owned. Out of pure luck, this one worked! It is also a great facial moisturizer so overall an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love using this it&#x27;s got a mild scent nothing bad.</li>
    <li> After trying multiple samples of the [[ASIN:B003RF82UK Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream, 1.70-Fluid Ounce]] and loving the texture and light moisture I went into the store to pick some up but saw this next to it. Thinking since they&#x27;re both in the Moisture Rescue line and this one had SPF 15 I&#x27;d try this one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a light moisturizer and I was pleased with the SPF factor but it made my skin, which is both combination and sensitive, quite greasy looking. I&#x27;m a bit acne-prone but had no trouble with this causing break-outs which is good news. :) The moisture was insanely long lasting, after a long day when I wash before bed my skin still feels great. Most of all I love the smell, this doesn&#x27;t smell chemically or like it&#x27;s fragranced to mask a harsh odor. Yes, one of its ingredients is a fragrance but it&#x27;s light and makes me think of green things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really do like the quality and feel of this product. It feels luxurious for being a drugstore product. For me I think I&#x27;ll shelve it until after summer and see if perhaps the warmer weather wasn&#x27;t part of the reason this gave me the shinies. If you&#x27;re looking for a light moisturizer with SPF that&#x27;s friendly to sensitive and acne-prone skin I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try though I do still prefer the Gel-Cream (if you&#x27;re using a foundation with SPF over it like I do it&#x27;s a perfect combo).</li>
    <li> This product works very well to moisture my face, but it&#x27;s light enough that it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate or cause (from what I can tell) any breakouts. The only real down side to it is if you don&#x27;t rub it in all the way or well enough it can leave a bit of flaky film which looks and feels weird, so you can&#x27;t be too careless about it.</li>
    <li> My favorite face cream! I love this brand! Not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now and my face loves it.  It definitely helps keep the wrinkles under control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Garnier products for a while now and I love their creams? I will continue using them .</li>
    <li> This smells great and works very well. I definitely would consider purchasing again and recommending to others. Great sun protection. I like their gel moisturizer too.</li>
    <li> Use this daily &amp; I haven&#x27;t broken out once, which is a common problem I&#x27;ve had with a lot of facial sunscreens. This one is amazingly light &amp; fresh with a clean scent AND it&#x27;s affordable! It goes without saying that I will definitely be buying this one again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 1+ year: still amazing! My skin feels great, is never greasy, &amp; has never burned! The only time I broke out since I started using this product was when I tried a different brand that was more than twice the price. Learned my lesson!</li>
    <li> I use it daily before I put my makeup on and It is very light not too creamy or sticky which is great for the morning and SPF 15 is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness over any other brand, but I like the smell and the small, efficient dispenser.  It is not greasy either.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer and I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it on Amazon! This lotion is lightweight and soothing. It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Lightweight moisturizer that works well and has SPF! I use it daily and have bought it multiple times because I can&#x27;t stand the feel of sunblock/suncreens.</li>
    <li> This a great, light moisturizer with SPF 15. I wear it under my makeup daily. My skin gets oily during the day but will get dry and get flakey unless I moisturize. This does not exacerbate the oiliness. I am also prone to breakouts, especially during my time of the month and this has not exacerbated this either.</li>
    <li> I always apply this lotion to my face, wait about 3 minutes and then put on my base make-up. It works like a primer because my make-up goes on more smoothly and stays on all day. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  It is light and absorbs easily and has SPF 15!  It is not greasy or oily.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this moisturizer. Too bad it has been discontinued. The price is great for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. It is light and fluffy and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling sticky, which I hate. I have sensitive skin, so I need something light. This is absolutely perfect. I can&#x27;t find it at Target anymore, so I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, feels nice, and for me personally 1 or 2 pushes is a perfect amount for my face. Being spf 15 is also a bonus!</li>
    <li> I went looking for this moisturizer at a local Target and a CVS and was disappointed that they did not carry this particular kind. My sister is a make up freak and had a bottle of this which I sampled on my skin. My complexion is fairly smooth, but I have a tendency to get whiteheads and small blemishes around my chin, so oily moisturizers are a big no-no for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this moisturizer and think it is great for a lightweight sunscreen to wear before applying makeup. It smells great and the texture is perfect, not oily at all but still creamy enough to replenish your skin. I am not typically a fan of Garnier products, but after trying moisturizers from Aveeno, Neutrogena, and other &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; brands, I was won over by how smooth and noncomedogenic this product is on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, I would recommend this product if your have combination oily/dry skin and are looking for a lightweight moisturizer with SPF (though this SPF is on the low side, I&#x27;d also recommend supplementing with additional SPF via make up foundation or primer).</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that can get dry and this moisturizer has become my favorite. They replaced it in the stores for a brown spot remover and Amazon is the one place I have been able to find it.</li>
    <li> Smells like old lady perfume.</li>
    <li> Great item and fast delivery!  AAA+++</li>
    <li> In addition to these qualities (affordability and absence of greasiness), I like the very faint fragrance.  I have been using it for years ever since the product I was using previously was discontinued.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, but it appears that it is not in production anymore (the reason I&#x27;ve had to order from Amazon, rather than buying in store.)  It has a very nice light fruity scent and goes on very light yet has sunscreen.  I will continue to order from amazon as long as it is available and will really miss it when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. It&#x27;s very light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my face. It sinks right into my skin. It also hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all! I love that it has spf in it. i can&#x27;t think of a negative thing to say about it. It does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> I use Garnier 3 way face cleanser [[ASIN:B0050I2V9A Garnier The Ultimate Cleanser 3 Way Clean, 5 Fluid Ounce]] which I really like, so thought I&#x27;d give their moisturizer a try. I love the scent, but I can&#x27;t use this because it irritates my skin. I&#x27;d suggest steering clear if you have sensitive skin. Otherwise, it probably is fine.</li>
    <li> I had tried so many other products on my face to battle the dry patches of skin I get around my forehead during the day. This has been the only thing I&#x27;ve found to really diminish those puppies and keep my skin hydrated and feeling soft. I keep it on my bathroom counter so that I can slather it on as soon as I get out of the shower when my face is still damp. It also smells really fresh and clean. Love it!</li>
    <li> SPF is a must, so I love this lotion. It smells great and is light, which is especially great in warmer months under makeup, or no makeup. Nice smell, too.</li>
    <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose. Lightweight, not greasy, inexpensive, sun screen. I like it, I&#x27;ll use it. as I stated, it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> Contains all possibly known paraben</li>
    <li> I have oily/combination skin and this light moisturizer is just right for daily use.  I love that it has spf but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or have a sunblock odor.  It&#x27;s getting difficult to find this moisturizer in stores so I was very glad to find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the first face lotion I&#x27;ve tried with an SPF in it, that doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I have a mask on my face.  No oily feel to it either.  Very lightweight.  It has a pleasant scent, and absorbs fairly quickly after applying. My makeup goes on nicely over it too.  The large bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> A quality reason price can not ask for more, the cream is absorbed quite well, not greasy skin .... the only thing I like is that I had more sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;but excellent to have that price</li>
    <li> I really like that this moisturizer because it&#x27;s light, non-greasy, and I love the smell. It absorbs quickly, and has an SPF of 15. It&#x27;s a great summertime moisturizer for when it&#x27;s too hot to use thicker formulas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already had so many complimetns that my face looks so great... I love this stuff.  I dont use any other makeup... just a little blush and some mascara... the lotion makes your skin so vibrant and glowing!!!</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Fats Shipping. Good for breakout-prone oily skin.</li>
    <li> Does not make your skin get greasy and soaks in well. Light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot find this in local stores (they only have the heavier, more greasy version) so i order it online, Thanks for carrying it, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Why did Garnier discontinue this product?  I am very distressed that Garnier discontinued this product. I am now rationing what little I have left of this product. There is nothing that can compare with the quality and value. It is lightweight, provides UV protection, (which I need), and it absorbs instantly with very little scent that dissipates quickly. I cannot tolerate mild to strongly scented beauty products of any sort. This lotion is absolutely perfect for me! It is time for Garnier to pull out the formula again and get this excellent product back on the store shelves. I would be the first to buy 1/2 dozen bottles.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a good, inexpensive facial moisturizer with sunblock that wasn&#x27;t oily or gross. I&#x27;ve been trying to find something comparable to the version that Dove discontinued, and this definitely is a great substitute. I&#x27;d tried another brand and didn&#x27;t care for it. Smelled too much like sunblock, was a bit thicker than I&#x27;d care for, and I started having break outs and other misc. issues after long term use.    However, this is a great product and EXACTLY what I was looking for. To even find a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, is light, and has sunblock can be hard to find for under 10 dollars. Most are really expensive and what you get isn&#x27;t very much. Garnier&#x27;s product comes in a generous size (for a facial lotion), has all of the aforementioned qualities, and is very affordable.    I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants an oil free, light, facial lotion with sun protection. Very little goes a long way with this product, so you don&#x27;t need to put a lot on to get full coverage. It leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth, and clean. This lotion also has a light fragrance of grapeseed/apple, but it&#x27;s not too strong and is refreshing.</li>
    <li> Non grease product, easy to use, no scent, long lasting, easy application, I was happy with this purchase.  Perhaps I will by it again.</li>
    <li> Product is great and delivered very timely</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite moisturizers. Sometimes I use one with a slightly higher SPF(not sure if this brand has one), but this is my go-to.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, and this is a great year-round facial product. It is so lightweight and does not leave your skin feeling greasy. It has never clogged my pores or caused blemishes. Also, SPF 15 always a plus!</li>
    <li> This stuff is FULL, FULL, FULL, of parabens and all the bad chemicals you don&#x27;t want in a moisturizer.  Just take a look!  Honestly I&#x27;ve never seen a moisturizer with more chemicals than this stuff... WISH I could get a refund!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I am very upset that they discontinued it!!!</li>
    <li> This is the moisturizer I keep handy to either use everyday when my favorite moisturizer runs out, for travel and/or for backup. I have very oily skin and after putting it on, I sometimes dab the excess with a tissue and voila, I am good to go. Its light, smells refreshing and feels light on my skin. Also, a good base for makeup, however, I would suggest dabbing off some excess with a tissue BEFORE proceeding with makeup. I particularly like that it also has SPF 15.</li>
    <li> CHEAP ND WORKS LIKE HELL!!! iM A GUY AND i HAVE GUYS ASKIN ME WHAT IVE BEEN USING ON MY FACE!!</li>
    <li> So after finally being acne free for the first time since I was 12, I needed to find an all day moisturizer with spf. I found this at Walmart and decided to give it a try. I have tried the Garnier Nutriste Moisturizer and it made my skin a little more oily than it already is, so as soon as this came out, I tried it and LOVED it. It is light and not greasy. Amazing day moisturizer. I liked this so much that I bought the Moisture Rescue moisturizer to use at night. This product is best for oily break-out prone skin like mine. LOVE IT! I&#x27;m taking 3 bottles of this back to Spain with me, I hope it&#x27;s enough to last me nine months.</li>
    <li> My skin has become extremely dry this winter and I tried at least 5 different products from expensive to affordable. I even ended up using argan oil on my skin every morning to get through the day without the itchyness of overly dry skin. Mind you, I am a rather oily skin type person (even at the age of 47) so this was unusual for me. I also tend to break out when using new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally came across this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try, also considering the price. Wow! I can&#x27;t believe how smooth and hydrated my skin feels. To top it off it even has SPF. My skin feels great all day long but not oily or greasy at all. I have tried other Garnier SPF day lotions but this one is far better to use. It goes on well, not sticky and has no weird odor. My skin did not break out at all. Gets all stars from me!</li>
    <li> Really light moisturiser that smells lovely. Other products are thick and heavy on my skin but this is perfect. I can no longer find it in shops and was very pleased to find this on amazon</li>
    <li> I would have given it a 5 star but it smells and feels a little sunscreenish. It is better than some I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer.. not heavy, smells nice.  I use it daily, with or without my makeup.. I will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> My favorite face lotion.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand why the have to keep &amp;#34;improving&amp;#34; products-since everytime this was always almost sold out you would think they would know it is it a popular product-this is the only brand in there line that give great moisture without clogging pors &amp; also sunscreen without that burn that I get from other products-I hope I can stil buy this on line as I have tried other brands &amp; they just dont cut it.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive super pale skin and I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t burn, that had sunscreen AND I could use on my aging eyelids to prevent more wrinkles.  This moisturizer is A-MA-ZING.  It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and I can use it on my eye lids and it doesn&#x27;t sweat off and burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Score on all levels.  I will use this for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much! It makes my face glow. My makeup doesn&#x27;t crack anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy that I found something cheap...I hate buying expensive stuff &amp; not be sure if it works or not.</li>
    <li> I use Garnier products, but I have never tried this one. It goes on very smoothly and I really like it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am middle-aged.  This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Makes my skin soft and supple. I&#x27;m always told how beautiful my skin is. It&#x27;s fabulous that it also has spf 15. Garnier stopped making it. I tried their Skin Renew Daily Moisture Lotion with spf 28.  Awful!! Too thick and makes me break out.  Garnier should read the Amazon reviews to see that they made a big mistake and should bring it back or develop another lightweight daily moisturizer with spf, for their consumers.  Give me a reason to come back Garnier!</li>
    <li> Was not impressed.  It kind of burns my face. I like their hair products, but I am not impressed with the skin products.  they just are not for me.</li>
    <li> So I got this product about a month ago and I only used it for about 3 weeks. I have acne prone/sensitive/dry/oily skin and to be honest even though this product smells really nice and it feels really refreshing after applying on my face, an hour later the product made my face extremely oily and shiny...Hello breakouts. I use to use this product every morning but due to the breakouts, I had to stop. I really didn&#x27;t want to give up on this product but my face kept getting worst day by day. I would honestly recommend this for people who have dry/not prone to acne skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only face lotion I use.  It keeps my skin hydrated and is light.</li>
    <li> For the price and moisture content this product is underrated. Most of Garnier&#x27;s products are above average and below average in price. This stuff ranks with expensive cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Perfect texture and smell: I hope the product will not be stopped, it cannot be found in local stores anymore...</li>
    <li> Great sun protection and moisturizer without feeling greasy and heavy and clogging pores.  This is one of the only sun protection products my skin tolerates.</li>
    <li> It says SPF 15, but I think in reality it is SPF 100! I am not joking, I went to Mexico a month ago. My skin is pretty fair, so I was using a lotion with SPF 30 on my body, and got burned 3 times, and I was using this moisturizer for my face and applied no extra sunscreen. My face was looking very pale my entire vacation, so I decided to finally get some tan on my face and didn&#x27;t apply this in the morning - my skin was burning just after 20 minutes under the sun. This moisturizer has some really powerful UV protection!</li>
    <li> I hate a cream that you put on your face and you feel like your skin is thick with grease and clogging your pores.  I love this because it&#x27;s light and you don&#x27;t know you have it on.  Plus, it has sunscreen, which I was looking for.  Put it on in the morning--and done!</li>
    <li> The smell is good but I feel it&#x27;s to oily for me since I have oily skin. This product is a little too heavy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this primarily during the summer months for the SPF, but I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve begun using it during colder weather too. It goes on cleanly, without any greasiness, and I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to break out at all — it works just as well as the Oil of Olay fragrance free stuff that I was using, but has the added benefit of a nice clean scent and skin-protecting SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin gets just as dry under my beard as it does in areas like my nose and forehead, and this stuff cuts right through the scruff. Keep in mind that my beard is only about a quarter inch long, so I&#x27;m not fighting through a Grizzly Adams face shield, but it does the trick nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for both men and women. I just wish it were a tad bit cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!!  I am very picky about the way a lotion feels on my face and this one is one of the only ones I like for daytime use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it has been discontinued as I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore :(. So glad I was able to find it here and stock up!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight, not greasy, feels clean. But still moisturizers, and I can wear makeup over it just fine too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I was using eucerin sensitive spf face moisturizer, but it often left a white residue on my face. I decided to try something new and found this. I love it. No white residue at all. It also doesn&#x27;t leave dry patchy skin on my face.</li>
    <li> I am transitioning from the gel creme to get some sunscreen and more product for the same money. This doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, it is light and non-greasy, and it smells good. I like the pump so that I don&#x27;t get too much at a time. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I adore this face potion.It feels so nice on my face.I will buy again soon.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer it does a great job of lasting all day!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not to oily and I love the SPF.</li>
    <li> I like it very well - unfortunately nobody sells it in Germany - so I bought it furthermore here.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> My only face moisturizer I use now, love it, but hated the actual facial cleanser/creme. Broke out with cleanser, but this stuff works awesome!</li>
    <li> good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. Lightweight. Not oily. Absorbs fast. Soft, clean smell. I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a lot of trouble finding this moisturizer in stores (and am really hoping it hasn&#x27;t been discontinued!). It is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down on my skin at all. The scent is also very pleasant. It is a little disheartening that the price keeps increasing though. I think the first time I bought it (at a Target), it was on clearance for around $6.</li>
    <li> This product takes away the dryness on my face. I always apply it in the morning after washing my face. I love how it&#x27;s Lightweight and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, great for sensitive skin! The smell is just amazing!&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about it is that it ALSO has SPF 15 in it! AMESOME.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying this because it&#x27;s best for any type of weather too, Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Like others have said, it is a very light moisturizer and more for the warmer months. I do have acne prone sensitive skin and this does not irritate or cause breakouts on my face like other moisturizers I have used. It also has a very light, pleasant smell. This is one I&#x27;ll be keeping!</li>
    <li> I love this product, but for some reason I can no longer get it at my local store so I&#x27;m grateful that I can buy it at Amazon. It&#x27;s so creamy and lightweight, yet it has the SPF that I want. It&#x27;s perfect for wearing under makeup. I don&#x27;t know if it really helps to reverse sun damage, but it can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive dry skin, and have tried everything from L&#x27;oreal to Clinique products. You get 4 ounces of the best moisturizer that $10 buys, and comparable to brands 5X as expensive. Do yourself a favor and get the perfect all day moisturizer with UV protection.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!! Before this one I tired a olay with spf moisturizer and it was horribly thick and made my skin white. This moisturizer is perfect its thin but leaves me soft with no random dry spots and it doesnt leave me greasy by the end of the day. If you have combination skin with dry areas this will work well for you!!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a cheap, oil-free moisturizer with SPF- bonus points if it didn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. This moisturizer fits the bill entirely. I use it daily with makeup, either under powder foundation or mixed with liquid foundation and it works perfectly for both. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling heavy or like it has extra oil. It has a very like light scent that&#x27;s nothing like sunscreen. I will never go back.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a daily cream with a bit of UV protection. i love the day cream i&#x27;ve been using so far but it was discontinued and i was concerned this wouldn&#x27;t be as good. turns out i love it. the texture is nice, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin shinny, it hydrates well. the bottle is also bigger than what i&#x27;m used to, and cheaper! the smell is nice but subtle and not overwhelming</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this in the winter if you get dry like I do, but I used this on a trip to the Caribbean last week and it was perfect. I am normally an oily mess in pictures where I use sunscreen so this was the perfect amount of coverage. Only a slight oily sheen afterwards, compared with my usual moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Garnier Moisture Rescue Lightweight UV Lotion SPF 15, 4.50-Fluid Ounce is true to its name: LIGHT WEIGHT. my face does not feel greasy, even in the summer.</li>
    <li> I needing something that worked well under makeup but still gave me enough moisture. A little goes a long way - love the scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years now and found that it was discontinued in the stores.  Very happy to find it online and customer service was perfect!  Would definitely order from this vendor again.</li>
