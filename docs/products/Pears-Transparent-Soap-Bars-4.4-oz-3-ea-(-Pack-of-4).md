      <li>This is not the Original Pears Formula.</li>
      <li>TRUE AMAZON AND VOILA</li>
      <li>you feel really clean and fresh after using it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a different smell more like surgically clean.  </li>
      <li>Mild and gentle.</li>
      <li>Lathers up well, rinses clean and leaves skin soft.</li>
      <li>Pears has lost its market share in pure glycerin soap.</li>
      <li>The new formula is okay and tolerable, but it is just not the same.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the original, so you are rid of it faster.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using this soap for decades, and it&#x27;s hard to find in the US, so very glad to find it online.</li>
      <li>I discovered Pears Coal Tar Soap more than a half century ago.  </li>
      <li>But I really wish they would reintroduce the old formula.</li>
      <li>This is the new formula that smells like road tar.</li>
      <li>The smell is a little strong, but I am used to it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Original ingredients: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance</li>
      <li>As an invention, it does not get any where near my favourite soap.  </li>
      <li>and it brought back memories of Pears Natural Glycerine.  </li>
      <li>It also goes a long way, I am still on my first bar after a couple of months of use and it has about half a bar to go.</li>

    <li> I discovered Pears Coal Tar Soap more than a half century ago.  I hate sliced bread. As an invention, it does not get any where near my favourite soap.  If civilisation is to advance it must aspire to inventing things that are &#x27;greater than Pears Coal Tar Soap&#x27;.</li>
    <li> The scent is different than I remember.  My husband likes it and that is why I ordered it,  hard to find in our area sometimes.</li>
    <li> My family has been using Pears soap for years. We discovered it in Toronto back in the 1980&#x27;s.  It has a wonderful, clean smell and makes a nice stocking stuffer, especially for men, because the odor is not at all flowery.  It also rinses off nicely - you feel really clean and fresh after using it.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Always buy it in multiple packs. Often give as little gift. Mild and gentle. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP...I VISITED A FRIEND AND SHE HAD PEARS AND I IMMEDIATELY WANTED SOME OF MY OWN....COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT IN STORES, SO WENT TO THE TRIED AND TRUE AMAZON AND VOILA THERE IT WAS AND NOW IT IS IN MY HOME....LOVE IT...YES AND SO DOES MY FAMILY....</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for over 20 years and it is wonderful.  The smell is a little strong, but I am used to it.  It is worth it, the soap is excellent.</li>
    <li> I use the soap all the time</li>
    <li> We live in the northern plains and I have a real problem in the cold dry weather with cracks on my hands.  I tried a glycerine hand soap at a hotel we stayed at and it brought back memories of Pears Natural Glycerine.  To my amazement when I looked on Amazon there is was.  It does seem to be helping my hands this winter.  You can feel the glycerine when you are washing with it.  It also does not muck up the soap dish.  I have to still use hand cream, but my hands are much less dry this winter.  It also goes a long way, I am still on my first bar after a couple of months of use and it has about half a bar to go.</li>
    <li> This is not the Original Pears Formula. This is the new formula that smells like road tar. The only good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the original, so you are rid of it faster.</li>
    <li> I ordered these soap bars based on my childhood memories of having had them in my parents&#x27; home as a kid. For whatever reason, the smell of these soap bars now is not at all what I remember; they now smell pretty awful. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Pears has lost its market share in pure glycerin soap. Different formula and it stinks. I did not even open the package and it is been sent back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original ingredients: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New and horrible ingredients: Sorbitol, Aqua, Sodium Palmate/stearate, Sodium Palmkernelate, Sodium Rosinate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-4, Alcohol, Glycerin, Perfume, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Meta Bisulfite, Etidronic acid, Tetra Sodium EDTA, BHT, Cl 12490, Cl 47005, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Cinnamal, Eugenol, Limonene, Linalool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone knows where to find the original one, please let me know by adding a comment to this review. El horrible!</li>
    <li> If you want something that cleans and doesn&#x27;t have all that STUFF in it that coat your skin this is it.  It has a pleasant but not perfume smell. It&#x27;s a different smell more like surgically clean.  As a retired man who plays a lot of golf and takes a lot of showers , I love it.</li>
    <li> Very poor. Not the soap I remember from my childhood.&lt;br /&gt;It smells terrible and the list of current ingredients lead me to suspect the transparency is a reflection of its marketing rather than its purity.</li>
    <li> An excellent product and a good price.  We&#x27;ve been using this soap for decades, and it&#x27;s hard to find in the US, so very glad to find it online.</li>
    <li> But I really wish they would reintroduce the old formula.</li>
    <li> Eliminate all the perfume odors from your soap bar. Pears is the ideal body soap bar for people with sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good soap for all bathroom purposes.  I use this soap all the time and love it. I buy it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is the best glycerine soap, always a clean fresh scent !</li>
    <li> I miss the old formula Pears used prior to the switch a few years back.  The new formula is okay and tolerable, but it is just not the same.</li>
    <li> Lathers up well, rinses clean and leaves skin soft. Smells like a pleasant memory. It came packaged well and should last a long time.</li>
