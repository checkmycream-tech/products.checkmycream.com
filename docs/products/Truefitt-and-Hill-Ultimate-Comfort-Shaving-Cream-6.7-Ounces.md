      <li>Amazingly KMF is leading now in head to head competition hence the 4 stars for T&amp;H.</li>
      <li>This smells amazing.</li>

      <li>Scent is nice but transitory.</li>
      <li>All you have to do is gather maybe 3-4 Q-Tip size dabs on your brush &amp; you&#x27;re good for 3 passes easy</li>

      <li>So far this is the best shaving cream I have used.</li>
      <li>A year now with the T&amp;H, I have determined that it is by far the best of all.  </li>
      <li>and I am really impressed with how much and how easy it lathers up..</li>

      <li>One very important note: with the Truefit, I&#x27;m shaving more often.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll want to use a shave brush/mug combination to get the best possible shave with this cream.  </li>
      <li>The feel top notch, luxurious even.</li>
      <li>They have been crafting these outstanding shaving potions since 1805....</li>
      <li>I absolutely love lathering this cream up in one of my brushes.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Using many types of shaving creams, I decided to give Treufitt &amp; Hill (unscented) a try.</li>
      <li>Plus, the more you develop your technique, the more the product world opens up.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really, if you compare the cost of this to any of the better pre-fab creams -- like, for example, Aveeno shave gel --</li>
      <li>Having used many shaving products over the years, I have come to some conclusions.  </li>
      <li>This one has more menthol in it,.</li>
      <li>This is easily my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I also love that is water based and not oil based</li>
      <li>this is my favorite shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>You get much better stuff for cheaper.</li>
      <li>but it seems like the more water you use the thicker it gets.</li>
      <li>I wish I would have discovered the \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; shaving (brush &amp; old-fashioned cream) years ago, my shaves have never been better or closer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also more prone to cuts using this cream.    </li>
      <li>Have used for more than 25 years.    </li>
      <li>course, your mileage may vary, but I love this shaving cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed them all, but T&amp;H is a class by itself.</li>
      <li>Is there any better shave cream?&lt;br /&gt;No F***ing Way</li>
      <li>This is my favorite shaving soap.   </li>
      <li>Mild lavender scent in the unscented is really nice.</li>
      <li>Use a decent amount in your shave and this product will yield a great shave and leave your skin notoriously smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found Proraso to be an excellent shaving soap for sensitive skin at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Try Geo F Trumper Coconut for a great lather for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>For me the most important factors are razor glide and closeness of shave.</li>
      <li>I love Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving creams and this product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>What is more, this is a fantastic product to shave with.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin too, doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest.  </li>
      <li>Every couch salesman says their couches are the most comfortable.</li>
      <li>Cleans off the brush easy.    </li>
      <li>but if you are a person who likes strong scents, this cream may not be for you.</li>
      <li>I shave after a nice hot shower.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, a very light lavender that I can detect only while shaving.    </li>
      <li>The cream has a very mild, light scent of lavender, don&#x27;t worry, the scent will not linger once you have finished shaving.</li>
      <li>This shaving cream foams up very quickly even with a cheap brush.  </li>
      <li>- This cream lathers incredibly well and is very easy to get a really rich, creamy, and fluffy lather.</li>
      <li>All of them are mighty fine.</li>
      <li>$30 is a bit more than other companies, but it&#x27;s an investment that I am willing to make because of just how EXCELLENT this shaving cream is.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a number of different shave creams for use with my badger hair brush, and this one makes the best lather yet, without requiring a large quantity to be used each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Using a Simpson Commodore 3x brush I can whip up a mighty lather in no time.  </li>
      <li>-Smooth</li>
      <li>Shaving with the grain, re-lathering, and shaving with/across the grain will yield one just as comfortable.</li>
      <li>Fantastic shave cream.</li>
      <li>I use a shaving brush and a Merkur razor with Light Feather Blades.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use just a little bit with a good brush and it lasts months.  Classy</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream available, and I&#x27;ve tried most of them. Superior to anything canned foam product. Apply with a badger brush. Expensive, but the tub will last at least a year of daily shaving - yes - a whole year. You only need a tiny dab to foam up your whole face using a &amp;#34;best badger&amp;#34; brush. Have been using this brand for 5+ years. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Most creams I have bought have been much more solid than this. It makes it very hard to not get too much on your brush and that will make this go much faster than other creams. On the other hand if you are in a hurry this is very easy to apply by hand. It doesn&#x27;t seem to protect as well as other creams such as the ones from Taconic. Also this seems to clog my razor much faster than other creams. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shaving soap.   I use a brush and I barely dab the bristles into the soap, it takes VERY LITTLE to make a good lather.  You will not be wrong by choosing this one.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not using any other shaving cream than Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving.  It requires only a small dollop of cream, brushes on nicely, sets my beard well, and leaves a nice lubrication layer on my skin after the shave.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and is odorless.</li>
    <li> I love Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving creams and this product is fantastic. It gives you a very smooth and comfortable shave with little to no irritation or razor burn. Plus you only need a small amount of this product for each shave, so it lasts a long time. My last one lasted over 8 months. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still relatively new to DE wet shaving. I&#x27;ve found Proraso to be an excellent shaving soap for sensitive skin at a very reasonable price. A cooling effect is quite nice and any of these top-notch soaps and creams are very competitive in price compared to the canned stuff when you calculate amount used, though American Crew and Nivea are somewhat decent among the mass market ware. But when you compare performance and price, I&#x27;d go with the traditional top-of-the-line soaps and creams over any American mass market concoction. Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort is quite comparable to Proraso Ultra Sensitive Skin in its performance outside of Proraso&#x27;s cooling effect. Proraso is far less expensive, but it does take more effort to develop a rich lather. Right now I&#x27;m still exploring and a bit torn between the two. Honestly, I&#x27;m leaning toward the Truefitt which lathers much more richly and immediately with less. As always, the proper preshave is as important as the lather and I&#x27;m still in a cook-off there. Plus, the more you develop your technique, the more the product world opens up. I have much to try, like Art of Shaving and Tabak. But so far, if Truefitt and Proraso aren&#x27;t the end-all, they&#x27;re a fantastic place to start. One very important note: with the Truefit, I&#x27;m shaving more often.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad batch (which raises consistency concerns) or maybe they changed their formula.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and loved it. In the latest jar I bought the very subtle lavender scent is gone and what is left is rather unpleasant. I had about left in my last jar and compared the jars head to head - totally different scent. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaving cream due to the comments left by others.    I am comparing this to \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; Non Scented shaving cream, \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; Sandle Wood disk shaving cream.  I use a shaving brush and a Merkur razor with Light Feather Blades.    I was very impressed with the lather, thick and moist. In fact very little is needed for \\&quot;Method\\&quot; shaving using three applications in one morning shave.    Cleans off the brush easy.    Moisturizes my face all day and very comfortable.    I would definitely compare this to the Art of Shaving creams, in fact I think it is a bit better.</li>
    <li> Having used many shaving products over the years, I have come to some conclusions.  One, for everyday shaving, I prefer the Braun 360 Complete electric (8000 Series).  I also have the Series 7 Pulsonic, but do not like it as much.  Now onto the weekend shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weekends for most of us are a little different.  A little more relaxed in mood, clothing and habits.  A time for those perfectly broken in jeans, grilling out and the time to indulge ourselves a bit.  One of my favorite weekend rituals is a wet shave with a good razor, a stiff badger brush, and a high quality shaving creme.  A year or so ago, I discovered the Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Shaving Creme.  Having used the various canned producs, along with several higher quality creams, I found most of them to be drying and irritating.  A year now with the T&amp;H, I have determined that it is by far the best of all.  It is easy to apply, stays moist and smooth through the whole shave, and has a nice clean fragrance (subtle).  It is also a good value, as a small amount can be whipped up into a fine lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Truefitt &amp; Hill products.  They have been crafting these outstanding shaving potions since 1805....and I think they have got it just right.</li>
    <li> It is amazing how little of this product you need to get a rich, full lather to cover your face (multiple times). My tub has lasted five full months of once-daily use, and I still have slightly less than half of it left. As for quality, I have never experienced as close or comfortable a shave as I have with T&amp;H Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream. I use a Merkur Futura DE razor for days when I have time for a full shaving experience, and a disposable two-blade for the days when I am rushed, and the results are always top-notch when I use this cream on top of a Proraso Pre-Shave Cream. Do not be put off by the price tag on this product, as it is really an investment in nearly a year worth of close, comfortable shaves.</li>
    <li> I used to get really bad razor burn on my neck and ingrown hairs. This product fixed 90% of it within a week of shaving.  I also love that is water based and not oil based so it also brought my acne down to zero.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been using this cream for almost a year. Never been happier, no irritation at all after shaving, but my skin still feels dry. After shave lotion solves that problem. This is one of the best shaving creams I have used and you only need a small dab. I used to use the one by Art of shaving before this. I still use the art of shaving badger brush.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000F5KFZU Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream, 6-Ounces]]I received an unscented Shaving Cream which I will use. However, I prefer the flavored ones we previously were able to order, Lime, Lavender, and others. Have used for more than 25 years.    Roger</li>
    <li> First off, the product description is a tad misleading. This product DOES have a noticeable scent of lavender oil due to it being an ingredient in the cream; \\&quot;noticeable\\&quot; meaning the smell is apparent when opening the tub and while brushing on your skin, but not after this point. This may bother some that are sensitive to scent. Before using this product, personal taste prompted me to avoid products scented with lavender as they tended to be very, VERY strong. This is not so with this product. Rather, Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Shaving Cream walks a fine line between mysteriously relaxing, present but not oppressive, and a source of live-wire masculinity that most often miss. What is more, this is a fantastic product to shave with. Use a decent amount in your shave and this product will yield a great shave and leave your skin notoriously smooth. Case in point, this product has allowed me to shave half as much as I normally would with a disposable razor due to the close shave it facilitates. Correct shaving procedure dictates to never shave against the grain, yet it is possible to do so with this product and receive a very comfortable shave. Shaving with the grain, re-lathering, and shaving with/across the grain will yield one just as comfortable. For anyone beginning to shave with a quality cream or for a first-time safety razor user, this product is strongly recommended as a gateway to the ultimate shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times now and I am really impressed with how much and how easy it lathers up..you really do get ALOT of lather from just a small drop of cream. I say this is my #2 shaving cream because I also currently use the CO Bigelow /Proraso Brand shaving cream along with the Proraso pre-shave prep and that is my favorite simply because combining those two products together creates the closest shave ever and I tend to have sensitive skin and this keeps the burn at bay since it provides the cooling effect, I do not get ANY burn at all when using the Proraso. With the Truefitt Hill Ultimate Comfort cream, I still had just a little razor burn so that is why it gets bumped down to #2. IMO, you would be hard pressed to find a better shave cream...I wish I would have discovered the \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; shaving (brush &amp; old-fashioned cream) years ago, my shaves have never been better or closer. To all of you dudes out there still shaving with the aerosal foam/gel cans, take a look at the ingredients and see what they put in that junk...no wonder it&#x27;s only $4-5 dollars, and it&#x27;s no wonder why that junk is horrible for your skin...No way I will ever go back to the cans again..Overall A+ shaving cream..</li>
    <li> OUCH!!  This stuff kills my skin!  This is the second time I&#x27;ve used the Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream, and it is the second time I&#x27;ve walked away from my shave with a horrible rash on my damn face!!  I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking giving it a second try.    Using this product achieves a result similar to rubbing poison ivy on my face.    I do have slightly sensitive skin, so maybe this could work for you.  But really: if there is something in there that causes the skin on my neck &amp; face to respond like that....is it really something that you want to be using?    On the plus side: it lathers very nicely and the lavender scent is enjoyable but not overpowering.    Finally, for the skeptics out there that are thinking \\&quot;hmm, maybe it is not the shaving cream but some other step in his routine that is causing the reaction\\&quot;...not the case.  Today the only change to my routine was substituting in the T&amp;F shaving cream, and the result was painfully different from the norm.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving cream.  It generates a nice thick slick foam.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Recently got this and it is as good as most of the other reviews make it sound. It gives you a very thick and lubricated shave and you hardly have to use any of the cream to get it to lather up impressively. I used to shave with a lanolin based shaving soap and I would nick myself all the time. I just attributed this to me not being careful but since I&#x27;ve gotten this cream I haven&#x27;t nicked myself once. Like everyone else mentioned as well, it does smell faintly of lavender so if you are expecting a completely unscented product this is not it.   One thing to note is the packaging is slightly different than you see in the image here. Not that it matters to me but the packaging I got was actually just a plastic tub, not a metal top which is what the picture here looks like.  I docked it a star since it&#x27;s pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> This is far and away the best shaving cream that I have ever used. It lathers incredibly well and lubricates superbly. The first time you try it you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and it is by far the very best shave cream I have found.  I liked using the fragrance free cream so it wouldn&#x27;t conflict with any other products I was using.</li>
    <li> This is a very luxuriant cream that makes for a very thick shaving foam. While the price may be off-putting for first-timers, this product is a great choice for people who hate to shave because of discomfort. I can&#x27;t bring myself to use anything else anymore, and I find that it lasts a very long time. When the price is divided the number of uses, it isn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is the best I have ever used. I no longer get shaving bumps and I will be buying this product in the future. Use this product with a badger hair brush and you will never go back to the canned shaving cream.</li>
    <li> The best one I&#x27;ve found ever! The only other is the shave creme from Em&#x27;s place in Lincoln city , OR. Also, her minty menthol after shave can&#x27;t be beat in my opinion. Also I have a badger brush that I use with the trufit creme because it whipps up nicely for multiple passes for those with coarser beards. Only an almond size dollop will due for a multi-pass badger brush wet shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a number of different shave creams for use with my badger hair brush, and this one makes the best lather yet, without requiring a large quantity to be used each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems expensive, but it actually seems to last long enough compared to the cheaper Proraso that the extra money is worth it. Plus the lather is 10x better with much less work.</li>
    <li> i tried the sample pack but didn&#x27;t really like any of the scents - the light lemony scent of this one is great.  Just a small dab makes a great lather.</li>
    <li> Rash,redness, stinging, irritation. Hive-like redness all over my face after first use! Hestinant about the aftershave balm I just ordered from the same company. Beware of product ingredients. You may be allergic!  Stearic Acid, Myristic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut Acid, Glycerin, Lavandula, Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil,Triethanolamine, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool. Endorsed by the Royal Family. Reptilians from outer space! Haven&#x27;t you guys seen V?!</li>
    <li> This is a good shaving cream, you get a good rich lather, it is smooth, unscented...although there is a hint of lavender...and that&#x27;s about it. I do not find it however to be remarkably different than other good shaving creams in terms of comfort or reducing razor bumps...the slight edge it has over regular shaving creams from a tube does not justify the price so i don&#x27;t think i will buy again</li>
    <li> Best lather!  Goes further!  Turns warm on skin when used with T&amp;H pre-shave Oil!  Have tried 3 other brands and by far and away this is the best!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money or the hype.  It is certainly non irritating and it whips up good lather in no time.  However, it seems to dry on the face very quickly reducing the lubricant and cushioning quality.  No scent and does not irritate the skin.  But without the lubrication lasting through the entire pass I will not be able to continue to use this.</li>
    <li> As I have written elsewhere within this subject I have tried just about every major brand of soap, cream or stick. For me shaving is very important and I&#x27;ve found most products are so rich that a very little lathers up nicely and the entire product really lasts a long time. For me the most important factors are razor glide and closeness of shave. Also important is how it leaves your skin feeling afterwards(\\&quot;baby-bottoms\\&quot;). Scent is nice but transitory. Because the products are so rich cost is not really that significant.&lt;br /&gt; Now to get to Truefitt &amp; Hill - as of now it has made it into the \\&quot;final 3\\&quot; after I have eliminated about 12 - 15 others. The other 2 finalists are The Art Of Shaving (the most expensive) and Kiss My Face (by far the cheapest!) Amazingly KMF is leading now in head to head competition hence the 4 stars for T&amp;H. The Art of Shaving is so expensive that it might have to be eliminated even though it showed well in the few outings I indulged in it. It might be as good as the KMF. I shave each half of my face with one product then switch halves the next day. I probably have enough products to last me the rest of my life. Bottom line - this is a fine product and is better than MOST other products.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;I neglected to mention Taylor of Old Bond Street. A last minute appeal was filed and it actually went head to head with T&amp;H for 4 consecutive days and I have to admit it won by not a slight margin. Accordingly T&amp;H has been demoted to the 2nd rank and TOOBS has earned its way into the finals with Art of Shaving and Kiss My face. Stay tuned...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t live up to the hype, it was NOT comforting to my sensitive skin.  It may work wonderfully for some people but not me.  Just putting it alone on my face burned, it was irritated and turned red … all before dragging a sharp blade across my skin.  Disappointed, but these are individual experiences.</li>
    <li> This cream gives me the smoothest shave every.  This tub apparently lasts for months, so, while it&#x27;s expensive, the per shave cost is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 28 year old Asian male who has sensitive skin.  I shave every couple days with a Merkur razor and Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream.  I&#x27;ve tried many shaving creams such as Nivea, Aveeno, Gillette Gels, Polo Sport, and Neutrogena Shaving lotion and none of them have out-performed this product.  I also like the fact that is unscented so it doesn&#x27;t clash with my aftershave, deodorant, or cologne.    This particular product is more expensive than most shaving creams, but you won&#x27;t need to use a large amount of it.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leaves my face smooth.  I&#x27;ve always had a close clean shave while using this shaving cream with a single blade safety razor.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing. Can make this last a year easily with a good brush.</li>
    <li> Little expensive but high quality stuff.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again for sake of trying different stuff.  Plus this stuff unscented. Would like a manly scent at least.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on August 6, 2010 (according to the yellow bar at the top of this page, courtesy of Amazon) and am coming back today to purchase the product again.  Yes, the one tub lasted me just over a year.  The high upfront price is offset by the fact that it will last you a very long time.  The cream itself is great.  I started DE wet shaving a year ago and tried out a few different products in different price ranges.  This is easily my favorite.  It lathers quickly and you get a very creamy end product with little work.  You&#x27;ll want to use a shave brush/mug combination to get the best possible shave with this cream.  It&#x27;s billed as \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; but there is a lavender scent that is not overpowering; just keep in mind that this is not void of all scent.  I won&#x27;t rewrite what other reviewers have said but I plan to use this cream for another year.</li>
    <li> My husband says that this soap gives him a very close and smooth shave. I&#x27;m giving it four stars b/c of the price of the product.</li>
    <li> Closeness counts for me, very much, and I&#x27;m very much of the opinion that the key to a close shave is the lather.  The only way to lather is to mix it yourself in a bowl (4&amp;#34; diameter --- none of these silly little 3&amp;#34; bowls or any type of shaving mug), and no &amp;#34;pucks&amp;#34; of hardened soap.  They never do soften enough to give a good lather.  I&#x27;ve tried several creams, and Truefitt &amp; Hill is my favorite.  You can get straight razor closeness with a cartridge blade.  I recently switched back to cartridges after two years of alternating between a straight razor and a safety razor.  It was simply a matter comfort and time --- naked blades, regardless of &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;safety,&amp;#34; irritate the skin (see my review of Feather) and they require time, particularly as a cautionary matter.  Two months ago I started using Gillette Fusion (see my review) and continued using Truefitt &amp; Hill --- same closeness, no irritation to speak of and much less time. Don&#x27;t know how much Edwin Jagger pre-shave lotion figures into the equation, but it is part of my routine.</li>
    <li> I have tried many shaving creams and soaps, trying to find something rich, creamy and protective for my sensitive skin, and this one is a winner!  Not only did it provide a rich, creamy lather, which was very easy to obtain, but the slick glide I got with the razor was amazing.  I was also using a new DE open comb razor with a new blade, and this cream provided the protection needed with no irritation.  I&#x27;m definitely sold on this shaving cream and will buy it again with this tub is empty!</li>
    <li> This is the best brand shave cream on the market, and I like how smooth my face feels after shaving.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Taylor of Bond St. shaving creams but was sick of being stuck with a strong smell until I finished it up.  The Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream is has a mild fragrance (there is some, it&#x27;s not completely unscented), but I will take it versus being overpowered by the fragrances of Taylor of Bond St.  It&#x27;s also a bit thicker so it lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving using the Art of Shaving products and shave cream which is good. However, this shave cream is great! It works wonderfully and will also last me much longer thus being even cheaper in the long run. I&#x27;m very happy with this shave cream, it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome.  This has been my go-to for months now.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving cream beacause i wanted to compare it to some shaving cream that i make at home. I thought that this one shaved very nicely and lathered well but i was not impressed with the shave as much as i had hoped. My homemade shaving cream makes my skin feel nice and soft. this didn&#x27;t give me that feeling.</li>
    <li> Using many types of shaving creams, I decided to give Treufitt &amp; Hill (unscented) a try. This is what I concluded. The cream has a very mild, light scent of lavender, don&#x27;t worry, the scent will not linger once you have finished shaving. It lathers up extremely well, better than other cream I have used, and that&#x27;s several (including some of the top brands). It protects well during the shave, which leaves no irritation from the blade. Rinses well, with a clean feeling when done, some other creams don&#x27;t feel like they wash completely off sometimes. I have received similar \\&quot;closeness\\&quot; results shaving from other creams, but that might have to do with the razor as much as the shaving cream. Outside of that, this shaving cream is superior in every other way.</li>
    <li> Every couch salesman says their couches are the most comfortable. Many of the shaving cream companies claim that their shaving cream is comfortable and cushy...Truefitt &amp; Hill has the corner on the market of comfortable shaving creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands of shaving creams, and this is by far this most comfortable that I own or have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  - This cream lathers incredibly well and is very easy to get a really rich, creamy, and fluffy lather. The peaks on this cream are second to none. I absolutely love lathering this cream up in one of my brushes.&lt;br /&gt;  - When shaving with this cream, I feel like my razor is a stick of butter gliding along my face. They say it on the bowl...ultimate comfort, and that&#x27;s 100% true. This is a VERY comfortable shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;  - You might pay a premium @ $30 for a tub of this shaving cream, but I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;  -Smooth and razor burn free. I have slightly sensitive skin, and this cream all but eliminates razor burn. Really, when I use this, I don&#x27;t even worry about razor burn because of the quality of this cream. It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  -Price. $30 is a bit more than other companies, but it&#x27;s an investment that I am willing to make because of just how EXCELLENT this shaving cream is. If I could give six stars, I would...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, your mileage may vary, but I love this shaving cream. It&#x27;s a regular in my rotation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m convinced now that Truefitt &amp; Hill is one of the best luxury shaving creams out there.  I&#x27;ve tried most of the top English shaving creams and all of The Art of Shaving, but, Truefitt&#x27;s selection as a whole is a little more \\&quot;richer\\&quot; in regards to ingredients.  This cream whips up very thick into a meringue like substance with a silver tip badger hair brush and some hot water.  I shave after a nice hot shower.  The only complaint I have is you might need to use Truefitt&#x27;s Ultimate Comfort pre-shave oil before you apply this cream as it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as their other scents (i.e. Rose, West Indian Limes, etc.).  It&#x27;s expensive shaving cream, yes - but, even if you shave daily this tub will last at least six months or longer.  If you are still on the fence and can&#x27;t decide, I strongly advise you go directly to Truefitt&#x27;s website and order a sample pack.  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sensitive skin and it shaves very very smoothly!  It also lasted me about 6 months.  Best shaving cream I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> Once you try this, you will be spoiled for life. No other shaving cream even comes close. So if you try it just once, you&#x27;ll end up buying it for the rest of your life. Compared to the Art of Shaving? How does a Maybach compare with a Lexus? AOS is great stuff, but Truefitt &amp; Hill is on a whole new level. Anthony Logistics? Dermalogica? L&#x27;Occitane? Clinique? All of them are mighty fine. I&#x27;ve enjoyed them all, but T&amp;H is a class by itself. Don&#x27;t let the price tag scare you. This shaving cream is extremely concentrated. Just a small amount produces a crazy-rich lather. This stuff is so luxurious, it&#x27;s hard to go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not totally scent free, but what&#x27;s there is very mild and pleasant. The feel top notch, luxurious even. This is great stuff to use for wet shaving with a brush &amp; safety razor. Although a tad pricey a little goes a long way -- especially when using a brush to lather up.</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving for some time now. I thought I had the best shaving soap, I was wrong. This was a bit pricey but I thought I would give it a try due to reviews on other sights. I am sold!! WOW, Best lather, and shave I have ever had. I have never used an electric razer and this is the best product I have used in 25 years of shaving! Bite the bullet and buy some to try!</li>
    <li> It feels super luxurious, lathers from the smallest pea sized amount and my razor glides smoother than it ever did on my old &#x27;Art of Shaving&#x27; cream.  Great for sensitive skin too, doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest.  I don&#x27;t see myself buying anything other than this for the rest of my life, seriously it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas, after I saw all the positive reviews on here.  He loves it and says it&#x27;s the creamiest shaving cream he has tried so far.  Also it has a subtle scent -- not strong at all, but still smells nice!</li>
    <li> Unbelievably rich and luxurious. Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving creams whip up  thick, creamy lather in no time flat. This is true of all their creams, but I decided to stick with this unscented one so that afterwards, I can choose an aftershave balm to suit my fancy for that day without risking a clash of fragrances. I like Proraso cream a lot, but Truefitt &amp; Hill is in a league by itself.</li>
    <li> Compared the Barbasol and Gillette Edge in spray cans, and L&#x27;Occitane and Proraso in tubes this is my favorite shaving cream.  Mild lavender scent in the unscented is really nice. It has a smooth consistency and a little dab lathers up so the tub will last a very long time. I like it so much I want to try the aftershave lotion too. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like L&#x27;Occitane does</li>
    <li> This shaving cream foams up very quickly even with a cheap brush.  Feels good on face, smells good, not overpowering...makes for a great shaving experience.  I have no problem with clogging on my DE razor.  I use for 2-3 passes always with smooth comfortable results. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. :)</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this cream immensely.  I use it with Art of Shaving pre-shave oil, unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it to be the perfect complement to the shaving oil.  The shaving oil provides great lubrication and the cream adds a nice extra glide in there while also you can just use a thin layer of cream so you can still see the stubble and get a great shave.  A little dab will do you because it is not much cream in there but you don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box itself is art my wife digs it and just knowing that you are using the same shaving cream as like the Earl of Sandwich or whatever, I like the whole English royal thing so yeah, 5 stars.  I save so much money with the D/E shaving, not having to buy Mach 3 cartridges anymore, I figure why not splurge on a great cream like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also like is that it has a mild antiseptic and I do get some minor knicks and you can feel the cream gently going to work on those minor knicks as soon as they start and early antiseptic means faster healing and that&#x27;s a fact.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to try it. At $35 shipped, it&#x27;s definitely a luxury and I found it surpasses the Jack Black cream in lather feel and shaving closeness. Just get it!</li>
    <li> I have used Art of Shaving shave cream and now Truefitt and Hill and I have to say Truefitt wins the contest. Shave cream ultimately protects the face from the razor and to do that lubricity needs to be added between your face and the razor so burns and cuts are eliminated or minimized (depending on how wild you are when you shave). Truefitt does this extremely well! It is, price per ounce, a better buy than other competitors products and does an exceptional job. With any of the shave creams you do want to mix them in a porcelain cup prior to applying to your face. I find that Truefitt does a great job in allowing the razor to glide over my face!</li>
    <li> A real luxury enhances the shaving experience</li>
    <li> **Upfront advice:    I guess I&#x27;ll have to be one of the few voices of dissent about this product.  This is a nice shaving cream, but for me, it didn&#x27;t live up to the expectations I got from reading all the glowing reviews.  Shavers with tough beards and sensitive skin, beware.    **Positives:    TH Ultimate Comfort lathers well.  Using a Simpson Commodore 3x brush I can whip up a mighty lather in no time.  The smell is pleasant, a very light lavender that I can detect only while shaving.    **Negatives:    TH does not provide adequate razor glide and protection for me, especially for multiple passes.  I shave with a Merkur Futur at setting 3 to 4 using Feather blades.  By two passes after the first  I can feel the blade begin to drag and irritate my skin.  This no doubt has something to do with the fact that, while TH gives a big lather, that lather begins to flatten and thin rather quickly. Decreasing the amount of water to form a denser lather helps somewhat depending on where on my face I&#x27;m shaving, but means I must use a little more product to get enough lather for a shave.  Even making the lather quite dense, the sensitive skin on my neck is visibly irritated after I shave with TH.  I&#x27;m also more prone to cuts using this cream.    To compare, Musgo Real, my current favorite cream, gives me four reliably comfortable passes after the first, and the irritation on my neck is considerably less.  Likewise, I cut myself less using Musgo.    **Bottom line:    I wanted to like this cream, but it just doesn&#x27;t provide enough protection for my skin.</li>
    <li> Definitely lathers well. Feels great on skin. This shaving cream is unscented. That is how I wanted my cream but if you are a person who likes strong scents, this cream may not be for you. So far this is the best shaving cream I have used. I have very sensitive skin and this cream works out fine for me.</li>
    <li> Is there any better shave cream?&lt;br /&gt;No F***ing Way</li>
    <li> Fantastic shave cream. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this, especially if you pair it with the Truefit &amp; Hill pre-shave oil.</li>
    <li> Very smooth with or without a brush. Very easy on the skin. Heavy beard tender skin a hard combination to please. This does it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; shaving cream for my sensitive skin. Although marketed as being unscented, there is a faint eucalyptus/aloe (?) scent.  Nothing overpowering or unpleasant, in fact it is quite nice, but not what I would consider unscented.  I believe this aroma is due solely to the ingredients used and is not due to any added fragrance.  The only issue I have with this cream is that it seems to &amp;#34;gum up&amp;#34; my razor (IKON slant blade) and doesn&#x27;t rinse off/clean up as easily as my other creams.  It does seem to work well on my sensitive skin, but I probably won&#x27;t order it again as the TOBS Eton College and TOBS Mr. Taylor work just as well for me.</li>
    <li> Truffit and hill only sells ultimate comfort shaving cream in a silver tub not white. is this fake? Don&#x27;t what to say, actually.</li>
    <li> I will never use regular shaving cream again.  This is great.  I have very sensitive and fickle skin, and this item does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream lasts forever.  Just don&#x27;t leave open or let water get in</li>
    <li> Overpriced! Try Geo F Trumper Coconut for a great lather for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This one has more menthol in it,. leaves a nice feel to the face, rinses well, and feels good when applied. I am giving an update, I tried the Jack Black shaving cream, and head to head with the Trufitt Jack Black actually foams up better, even a little smoother shave, but I like the Trufitt also.</li>
    <li> It is just ok, makes a nice lather. Expensive for that. You get much better stuff for cheaper. I am going to give it away.</li>
    <li> Every now and again, especially when I&#x27;m running low on my Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort, I&#x27;ll try one of the myriad other options available to me.  And I&#x27;m not talking about cheap-o stuff, either -- but, boy, does the price tag on this one knock the socks off all other contenders.  So I&#x27;ll try other highly regarded shaving creams periodically.  Within a shave or two with anything else, I&#x27;m once again rationalizing the purchase of this thirty dollar shave cream.  This stuff is leagues above the next best product in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, if you compare the cost of this to any of the better pre-fab creams -- like, for example, Aveeno shave gel -- I&#x27;m convinced that the Truefitt &amp; Hill is no more expensive.  One container lasts me about nine months, while the canned stuff doesn&#x27;t last more than a few weeks.  Can&#x27;t say the same when comparing the T &amp; H to other more similar products, like [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]], though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the best shave, it helps to have the best product.  From my experience, this is indeed the best shave cream available, without question.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of purchasing this item for 30 bucks but am no longer a skeptic. Its so worth the money to get this shaving lather. My neck would get razor burn after shaving &amp; couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was that I needed to do to fix it. Heard this was some thick shaving lather per a previous review &amp; though why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets just say a little goes a long way with this stuff. I used a lot by accident the 1st time I tried it. The stuff I was using prior took a moment to gather on my brush. All you have to do is gather maybe 3-4 Q-Tip size dabs on your brush &amp; you&#x27;re good for 3 passes easy (At least for me anyway). I normally have to add a little water as I am applying but it seems like the more water you use the thicker it gets. My razor burn has minimalized to almost nothing &amp; that&#x27;s not going against the grain. Been a little hesitant since the last time I went against the grain. I broke out bad in razor burn so bad I still have ticks in my shoulders thinking about it. lol  I think even with this stuff I&#x27;d get razor burn going against the grain. Who knows maybe I&#x27;ll try but that&#x27;s another day. All I can say is that this stuff is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that it does have a slight scent as per previous reviews have stated but I shower after I shave so that does not bother me.</li>
</ol>
