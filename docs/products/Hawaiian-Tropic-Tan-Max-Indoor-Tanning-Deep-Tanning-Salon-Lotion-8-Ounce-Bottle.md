      <li>the smell is great</li>
      <li>Great Product and a great Price</li>
      <li>Even the smell wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
      <li>I am beyond PLEASED!!  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re more pricey but feel wonderful on the skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s oil-free but that also leads me to the cons: It provides no moisture.</li>
      <li>SMELLS GOOD TOO.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the sun</li>
      <li>This product smells good.</li>
      <li>Smells good.  </li>
      <li>Works good also</li>
      <li>and then when I run out of the good stuff and am waiting for a shipment (always from Amazon, NEVER pay salon prices).</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT LOTION THAT IS GOOD AND EASY TO USE.  </li>
      <li>I have a nice brown and not orange tan.</li>
      <li>This is the best indoor lotion gives great color that last and can&#x27;t beat the price .</li>
      <li>I have tanned for 5 days and am nice and brown.  </li>
      <li>For those wanting to be moisturized by natural ingredients while obtaining a great tan, YOU WILL LOVE THIS lotion!!</li>
      <li>To good to be true</li>
      <li>Love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>It works, but there are products that work better.</li>
      <li>seems to work pretty good for me</li>
      <li>However, it does smell pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I love this product it makes my skin feel soft after tanning also makes me feel great</li>
      <li>Works great for sensitive skin but could have a nicer scent</li>
      <li>This stuff smells nice during application and definitely helps intensify tanning, but the good ends there.</li>
      <li>I love  this product  because it is a  true lotion  and not a bronzer.</li>
      <li>Cheap and does its job.</li>
      <li>I prefer the silicone based oil free lotions instead.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it works if you use it consistently, but 3x/wk didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>The texture is very sunblock-ish and not luxurious or enjoyable at all.</li>
      <li>I have used a lot of different tanning lotions and they have all had a nice scent, but this one smells like a strong chemical.</li>
      <li>: it smells very nice - fruity but not sickeningly sweet.</li>
      <li>There was a noticeable difference in my success between the times I did and did not use this tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>On top of that, a plain old lotion will help you tan as good as this stuff does.</li>
      <li>The you are well aware there are lotion that cost $100.</li>
      <li>There are probably more expensive indoor tanning lotions that would make an even bigger difference, but for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t tan often and who doesn&#x27;t want to invest much more money than what&#x27;s already being paid for salon tanning bed use, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Highly unfortunate since it actually works fairly well at its intended purpose!</li>
      <li>I do not recommended it at all and would really like my money back.</li>
      <li>or it is extremely old.</li>
      <li>The bottle I received looked old.</li>
      <li>First off, it is very hard to rub in, like a cheap sunblock.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell if it worked but my skin dried out quickly but the smell stayed.</li>
      <li>This stuff is thin, watery, pretty much evaporates instantly and leaves your skin feeling parched after even a short tanning session.</li>

<li> and I did not think this was possible - even worse than the normal tanning bed reek.</li>
<li> I read a lot of reviews that were negative stating that this had a funny smell, or complainig that they were not pleased with tanning results.  </li>
<li> I had been using packets with bronzers from the tanning salon to get a base tan for my trip, and my tan was progressing nicely.  </li>
<li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not much of an indoor tanner, but I did use tanning beds for a few months leading up to my wedding.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t work good and it smells terrible</li>
<li> I would say if you want to tan slowly and only get a light base tan then this would be ok for you, but if you want to get a darker base than I&#x27;d buy something with a bronzer.</li>
<li> The writing on the label was half worn off.</li>
<li> It was a little too liquidy and the smell was a bit chemically.</li>
<li> It provided a little bronzer too.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find a tanning lotion for guys.</li>

<li> The Smell is terrible and it&#x27;s very runny.</li>
<li> This product caused my fiance to break out in a rash all over his body, not happy at all!!</li>
<li> It was almost impossible to find and INDOOR tanning product that is oil-free, containing NO CHEMICALS.  </li>
<li> This stuff makes it WORSE!!!</li>
<li> Absolutely awful.</li>
<li> and it was horribly noxious both times.</li>
<li> Terrible product, would never buy again.</li>
<li> Worst of all, the post-tan smell this stuff produces is -</li>
<li> Horrible smell and no affiliation to hawaiin tropic&lt;</li>

    <li> This stuff smells nice during application and definitely helps intensify tanning, but the good ends there. First off, it is very hard to rub in, like a cheap sunblock. The texture is very sunblock-ish and not luxurious or enjoyable at all. Worst of all, the post-tan smell this stuff produces is - and I did not think this was possible - even worse than the normal tanning bed reek. Struggling to define the stank today, the best description I could come up with was rancid baked potato. If that sounds bizarre and disgusting, it was. I&#x27;ve tried this stuff twice and it was horribly noxious both times. I&#x27;m buying Beachin&#x27; instead and using this only as a last resort. Highly unfortunate since it actually works fairly well at its intended purpose!</li>
    <li> No where on the Bottle does it say Hawaiian Tropic. The Smell is terrible and it&#x27;s very runny. Feels like Vaseline Intensive Care. Can&#x27;t tell if it worked but my skin dried out quickly but the smell stayed. Would not reccomend</li>
    <li> Runny and hard to rub in. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell and no affiliation to hawaiin tropic&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy</li>
    <li> Smells good.  Works good also</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work good and it smells terrible</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells. I have a nice brown and not orange tan. Cheap and does its job.</li>
    <li> The bottle I received looked old. Not like the one pictured. The writing on the label was half worn off.</li>
    <li> This product caused my fiance to break out in a rash all over his body, not happy at all!!</li>
    <li> I had been using packets with bronzers from the tanning salon to get a base tan for my trip, and my tan was progressing nicely.  Then I bought this bottle to save money and I just stopped getting tanner.  I think it has something to do with it having no bronzer.  However, it does smell pretty good.  I would say if you want to tan slowly and only get a light base tan then this would be ok for you, but if you want to get a darker base than I&#x27;d buy something with a bronzer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of an indoor tanner, but I did use tanning beds for a few months leading up to my wedding. There was a noticeable difference in my success between the times I did and did not use this tanning lotion. There are probably more expensive indoor tanning lotions that would make an even bigger difference, but for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t tan often and who doesn&#x27;t want to invest much more money than what&#x27;s already being paid for salon tanning bed use, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT LOTION THAT IS GOOD AND EASY TO USE.  IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE A LOT A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  SMELLS GOOD TOO.</li>
    <li> This product smells good. It&#x27;s hard to find a tanning lotion for guys. I like it and will contiune to use it.</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes my skin feel soft after tanning also makes me feel great the smell is great it works after the first&lt;br /&gt;Couple times. I recommend it.!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I love  this product  because it is a  true lotion  and not a bronzer. That means my hands don&#x27;t stain  and neither do my clothes.  Of course it has a fragrance  but not so overpowering  that I can&#x27;t  tan  on my lunch break and then return to work.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, gray deal the tanning salon was selling this for $40</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any acceleration of color whatsoever.  Moisturizing  is probably the only advantage of this product. Even the smell wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it works if you use it consistently, but 3x/wk didn&#x27;t do it for me. It doesn&#x27;t smell funky and isn&#x27;t too greasy.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I do not like the scent. I have used a lot of different tanning lotions and they have all had a nice scent, but this one smells like a strong chemical.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion every now and then when I run out of the good stuff and am waiting for a shipment (always from Amazon, NEVER pay salon prices). Pros: it smells very nice - fruity but not sickeningly sweet. I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t stain either. The low price is definitely a plus! It&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s oil-free but that also leads me to the cons: It provides no moisture. Tanning, as common sense tells you, dries out your skin. This stuff is thin, watery, pretty much evaporates instantly and leaves your skin feeling parched after even a short tanning session. You have to follow up with a moisturizing lotion after tanning with this to avoid getting itchy. I prefer the silicone based oil free lotions instead. They&#x27;re more pricey but feel wonderful on the skin.</li>
    <li> Works great for sensitive skin but could have a nicer scent</li>
    <li> Not as good as the sun</li>
    <li> Are you as salon tanner? The you are well aware there are lotion that cost $100. With that in mind, this $8 bottle T&#x27;Max worked well enough. It provided a little bronzer too. It was a little too liquidy and the smell was a bit chemically.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews that were negative stating that this had a funny smell, or complainig that they were not pleased with tanning results.  This is NOT the case for me.  I am beyond PLEASED!!  I think it has a very pleasant smell.  It was almost impossible to find and INDOOR tanning product that is oil-free, containing NO CHEMICALS.  I have tanned for 5 days and am nice and brown.  For those wanting to be stained by chemicals - this product is not for you!  For those wanting to be moisturized by natural ingredients while obtaining a great tan, YOU WILL LOVE THIS lotion!!</li>
    <li> This is the best indoor lotion gives great color that last and can&#x27;t beat the price . To good to be true</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion because I did not want a bronzed. This lotion does not smell at all like tanning lotion but like an industrial chemical. I do not recommended it at all and would really like my money back. Looking at the ingredients it should smell fruity.  It was either replaced with something else or it is extremely old.</li>
    <li> You know that smell you get after the tanning bed? This stuff makes it WORSE!!! Absolutely awful. On top of that, a plain old lotion will help you tan as good as this stuff does. Terrible product, would never buy again.</li>
    <li> Great Product and a great Price</li>
    <li> It works, but there are products that work better.</li>
    <li> seems to work pretty good for me</li>
