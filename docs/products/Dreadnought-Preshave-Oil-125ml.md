      <li>great and unique gift</li>
      <li>A little lighter/thinner than some shave oils (like art of shaving), but nonetheless works great and is probably the best value shaving oil I&#x27;ve found - like after-shave</li>

      <li>But I am a man, and it appealed to my masculinity, and I&#x27;m glad it did.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m glad it did,</li>
      <li>The perfect start to your daily shaving ritual.  </li>

      <li>It gives you a easy to glide skin, even when you have a couple of days without shaving.  </li>
      <li>This does have a nice smell but that&#x27;s the only good thing about this product.</li>
      <li>but this bottle huge.</li>
      <li>Has a light scent that covers up the oil smell a bit, but like i said it holds the smell of lather as well.</li>
      <li>Excellent pre-shave oil - really protects skin using a double edge razor.  </li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know if anything else works better, or if there is a different experience to be gained by trying a different brand, but I bought the huge bottle &#x27;cause it was a good deal, and it did not disappoint.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For that alone, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>But the added smoothness is nice, and a soft, not overpowering masculine scent make this worthy of the price charged.</li>
      <li>, I get a clean skin irritation free shave ) and I only notice it when I don&#x27;t use the oil, and my skin get ripped up.</li>
      <li>(First time DE user)</li>
      <li>After I use the oil I wash my hands with hot water and some soap</li>
      <li>Complements the other Dreadnought/Bluebeard products nicely.</li>
      <li>Price is also reasonable for the product size.</li>
      <li>I have used both skin creams and oils, and have found that this oil works very well.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
      <li>The oil is affordable and helps the straight razor glide and wanted.</li>
      <li>This oil works very well</li>
      <li>It really helps my razor glide over my face</li>
      <li>Better than expected.</li>
      <li>burn drama the first time I tried my new DE.</li>
      <li>This lube may better suited for other areas of the body, or used around the shop for use on tools.  </li>
      <li>And it is a large enough bottle to last almost a year or more.</li>
      <li>The shaving soaps and after-shave lotion are most important for the lasting scent, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
      <li>I selected this particular brand &#x27;cause</li>
      <li>But I did not notice a particularly closer shave.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I am sure the organic oils would be much better, at least on one&#x27;s skin, however, this does work, but no better than a cheaper bottle of the above, which, in organic mfg, is better for your skin.</li>
      <li>Read some reviews that said it was hard to get off, but I rinse hands with soap and warm water and havent had any problems.</li>
      <li>I have used a few drops, I have used many drops, all to no benefit.</li>
      <li>New to wetshaving</li>
      <li>So far, he said he loves it</li>
      <li>This product was really talked up on YOU TUBE by a British &amp;#34;You Tuber&amp;#34; so I thought I had to have it.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like old man shaving products.</li>
      <li>The smell is masculine, but not over powering.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my skin type, but it does very little to smooth out the shave itself</li>
      <li>/&gt;It did arrive after the rest of my order, still very timely, just not as fast, and resulted in a little bit of razor</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like thin grease then an oil</li>
      <li>I use it everyday and as long as you follow the instructions, your shave will be smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Its cheap compared to other brands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> smells/works great on my man.  great and unique gift</li>
    <li> Good stuff. A little goes a long way. Doesn&#x27;t smell like old man shaving products. I would buy again. Only thing is that the container I received is different than the one shown. But its no biggie.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and as long as you follow the instructions, your shave will be smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Its cheap compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> Does the job and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> The product has a weird odor!  Like nothing I have ever encountered.  I have a feeling I will throw it away even if it does what it is supposed to do.  Too bad you cannot &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; it before you buy it!  Another $18 wasted.  Will not buy another DREADNAUGHT product again!</li>
    <li> This oil is good for a pre-shave.  It gives you a easy to glide skin, even when you have a couple of days without shaving.  I use a safety razor and since using this product, irritation has been under control.</li>
    <li> The perfect start to your daily shaving ritual.  Complements the other Dreadnought/Bluebeard products nicely.</li>
    <li> This does have a nice smell but that&#x27;s the only good thing about this product. It&#x27;s more like thin grease then an oil and my shaver gets gunked up. It does nothing to improve the quality of my shave in fact I get more nicks and cuts with it then I do without it. After shaving I have a greasy film all over my shaving equipment and my sink is greasy as well. I shave using DE razors.</li>
    <li> Great shave oil&lt;br /&gt;..all dreadnought products are well shipped and are the best shaving items made.</li>
    <li> This product was really talked up on YOU TUBE by a British &amp;#34;You Tuber&amp;#34; so I thought I had to have it. It really feels good to use it, BUT I find it time consuming to go through the whole shaving process.  Between the pre-shave oil and the shave cream it clogs my razors (disposable) limiting the use of the razor before having to replace it.</li>
    <li> Product works great. New to wetshaving so I have no context being that I havent used other brands. Read some reviews that said it was hard to get off, but I rinse hands with soap and warm water and havent had any problems. Size vs value is good and performance is good. Will experiment different ones to see if i can find a distinction between different brands.</li>
    <li> Excellent pre-shave oil - really protects skin using a double edge razor.  Besides great protection the bottle is so large it will last all year.  Usually per shave oil comes in tiny bottles but this bottle huge. Great protection and great value.</li>
    <li> I used to have a HELL of a time with cutting myself (First time DE user) ever since I switched to this product I have had NO issues with nicks or anything.  The smell is great, and I get complimented on it a lot.  This stuff is fantastic can&#x27;t say enough great things about it honestly.</li>
    <li> Great product. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the scent. I prefer the scent of some other oils I&#x27;ve tried. The scent is pleasant but not as good as others.</li>
    <li> Smells and works great. And it is a large enough bottle to last almost a year or more. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Might be needed if you have a barbed wire facial beard, but for me it was way too greasy for every day use. I had high hopes, but this stuff is nasty, and there are other body oils (if you want oil) that works better for this purpose such as Neutrogena Body Oil. http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Light-Sesame-Formula-Ounce/dp/B001E96MRG&lt;br /&gt;  This lube may better suited for other areas of the body, or used around the shop for use on tools.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m not sure what this is supposed to do for my shaving experience. I have used a few drops, I have used many drops, all to no benefit. Maybe it&#x27;s my skin type, but it does very little to smooth out the shave itself and/or prevent nicks and burning (DE razor with Col Conk shaving soap is what I&#x27;m using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer noted the odd smell but it was the only place scent was mentioned negatively so I didn&#x27;t think much of it. However, it does have an odd scent. Not bad, necessarily, but if you&#x27;re expecting a great smelling oil, look elsewhere. The shaving soaps and after-shave lotion are most important for the lasting scent, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal. But don&#x27;t expect to be impressed when you apply this oil to your beard.</li>
    <li> A good product and attractively priced. I have no real criticism of this, but no glowing praise either. It did make my shaves smoother. For that alone, it&#x27;s worth the price. But I did not notice a particularly closer shave. But the added smoothness is nice, and a soft, not overpowering masculine scent make this worthy of the price charged.</li>
    <li> Have used several other pre shave oil brands in the past but this one puts the others to shame. Price is also reasonable for the product size. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I selected this particular brand &#x27;cause I liked the logo. In retrospect, I should have been terrified of the image of a Spartan, and probably selected something gentler. But I am a man, and it appealed to my masculinity, and I&#x27;m glad it did. This stuff is awesome. I don&#x27;t know if anything else works better, or if there is a different experience to be gained by trying a different brand, but I bought the huge bottle &#x27;cause it was a good deal, and it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;It did arrive after the rest of my order, still very timely, just not as fast, and resulted in a little bit of razor burn drama the first time I tried my new DE. But I&#x27;m glad it did, cause the next time I shaved and used this stuff, I had a basis for comparison. I have decided that it&#x27;s incredible.</li>
    <li> Better than expected.</li>
    <li> This scent is great, my gf loves it.  The oil is affordable and helps the straight razor glide and wanted.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the smell, for obvious reasons (can&#x27;t smell it through a computer screen!). This was part of a Christmas present to my husband, and it was perfect. The smell is masculine, but not over powering. So far, he said he loves it and it makes for a great shave.</li>
    <li> I feel this gives me a layer of protection for my double edge, seals in water, and holds the scent of my soap or cream a little longer then if don&#x27;t choose to use it. Ive heard that corn huskers will do the same, but will not smell as good. Has a light scent that covers up the oil smell a bit, but like i said it holds the smell of lather as well. For the amount you get for the price, id say its the best deal for your buck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a DE shaver and I use this stuff just around my neck area. It helps the blade glide over that touchy part of shaving. I would say if you are a pre oil user go ahead and buy. It is a good product. There is no smell</li>
    <li> A little lighter/thinner than some shave oils (like art of shaving), but nonetheless works great and is probably the best value shaving oil I&#x27;ve found - like after-shave they can be freakishly expensive.</li>
    <li> I tested and get the same effect from avocado oil and apricot oil.  I am sure the organic oils would be much better, at least on one&#x27;s skin, however, this does work, but no better than a cheaper bottle of the above, which, in organic mfg, is better for your skin.</li>
    <li> I have used both skin creams and oils, and have found that this oil works very well. it&#x27;s like using vitamins...... you don&#x27;t notice them until you have stopped taking them. This oil works very well ( another words, I get a clean skin irritation free shave ) and I only notice it when I don&#x27;t use the oil, and my skin get ripped up. I w9ill note that I also shower before shaving, then apply the oil, then my shaving cream with the brush, then shave.</li>
    <li> This oil seems to help me have a closer/smoother shave than when I didn&#x27;t use any at all.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great but that&#x27;s not why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Like all the Bluebeard&#x27;s Revenge/Dreadnaught products, this is of the highest quality. It has a light citrus scent, provides extremely effective lubrication, and works very effectively. Good merchant, delivered on time, well packed. 5 star transaction!</li>
    <li> I love this pre-shave oil. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference with razor drag with this. It really helps my razor glide over my face and I nick myself A LOT less. An earlier review I read talked about having oily hands all day. After I use the oil I wash my hands with hot water and some soap and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that. All in all I am going to be buying this again and I would recommend you do the same.</li>
    <li> It does do what it is supposed to do, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of the oily feeling it leaves on my hands after application.</li>
    <li> super smooth preshave oil!!</li>
</ol>
