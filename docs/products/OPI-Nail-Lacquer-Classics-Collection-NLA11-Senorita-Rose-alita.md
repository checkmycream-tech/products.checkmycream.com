    <li> I ordered OPI nail Polish from 3 different sellers and they arrived the same date. Love each  and every color and the coverage of the polishes. Extremely satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Very pretty shade.  I ordered this on July 18th and the product was not received until July 29th.  Almost gave up on it.</li>
    <li> Favorite color can&#x27;t find in stores</li>
    <li> I bought this color on a whim. I had never seen it before in person. It&#x27;s darker than the picture but it&#x27;s a very pretty classy color. I would say it&#x27;s appropriate for any age.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite nail polish color for years, and I finally found it again on Amazon.  I&#x27;m VERY happy.</li>
    <li> Very nice for both a mani/pedi. I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments when I wore it.</li>

    <li> beautiful. still smells like all other polish</li>
    <li> Love this color. It is cheerful and fun for toenails. I wear it year round since I live in Sunny California. It goes on easy and lasts a long time. I was addicted to &amp;#34;You Hue&amp;#34; but it has been discontinued and this is pretty much the same color. It is a very bright pink with a secondary golden hue that adds depth. The picture above does not do it justice. I start with a OPI base coat, do 2 coats of this color and finally sealed with &amp;#34;Out the Door&amp;#34; top coat. It lasts forever. I have bought several for gifts, even for my doctor who complimented me on it.&lt;br /&gt;Your toes should make you smile!</li>
    <li> OPI is the best nail polish, it lasts longer that any other polish I&#x27;ve tried. I always come back to OPI</li>
    <li> Great Color - I get lots of compliments when I wear this polish.</li>
    <li> Its cute but very very pink like a barbie nail polish. I like to use it when I feel more like a &amp;#34;pussycat&amp;#34; (which is not very often lol)</li>
    <li> I have worn this color before on feet and nails. I have received compliments from both male and female. I love that it has flecks of glitter in it!!</li>
    <li> Great color and product</li>
    <li> Fast service, great price &amp; great color</li>
    <li> I really like the nail polish.</li>
    <li> Always enjoy the OPI Polishes.  This one did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> OPI is the best polish.  I love the color, and the gold undertones make it really beautiful.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast. Exact color I was looking for after I had a manicure at the nail shop with this color. Very pleased</li>
