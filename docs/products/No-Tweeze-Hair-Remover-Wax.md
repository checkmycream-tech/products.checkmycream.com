      <li>Awesome product.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
      <li>if you are using this you must be a pro or have perfect aim or something.</li>
      <li>This brand is the best in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>The best wax.</li>
      <li>Great wax.</li>
      <li>great product....</li>
      <li>Worked great.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing and now saves me about $40 a month!</li>
      <li>Perfect alternative to bliss poetic wax.</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand how this has so many good reviews.</li>
      <li>but once you do, you&#x27;ll appreciate how effective it is.</li>
      <li>( I got the wax warm and applied it to my eyebrow.</li>
      <li>The product is not at all workable and is not any means of effective, my wife applied this</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the fact that it was made from bee&#x27;s wax.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the size,  the product was great. :-)</li>
      <li>This may be a good item for someone looking to wax their eyebrows, but anything more will call for more wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good thing is the hair came off, so you can feel your skin is smooth.</li>
      <li>Best wax for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Once I was able to apply some of the wax that was the right consistency (along the edge of the tin), I removed and found great results.</li>
      <li>However, once an even layer is applied, it does remove fine hair effectively.</li>
      <li>love that you don&#x27;t need strips to use this wax.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for 15 years on my eyebrows and love it.</li>
      <li>It had hardened on the stick before I was able to even bring it up to my face.</li>
      <li>I think it is much better than wax strips.</li>
      <li>but this is probably one of my favorite waxes.  </li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>i will be buying more</li>
      <li>(waxing has never been one of my favorite things to do).  </li>
      <li>Always prefer to use my finger to handle the wax, intead of those sticks they send witv the product, gives me more control.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite wax, it works much better than the sally brand as well.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love the fact I do not have to use strips, just let harden, flick the edge and pull off.</li>
      <li>I definitely love this wax.</li>
      <li>I have used it for many years .</li>
      <li>This one is perfect for facial waxing.</li>
      <li>A microwavable package would be more convenient.</li>
      <li>so when you pull you get more hair</li>
      <li>I get the more</li>
      <li>I never buy any other brand of wax for my eyebrows, this is just perfect and the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>I have tried several other brands but this works the best and fits in my warmer perfect!</li>
      <li>Removes hair better than the bliss poetic wax, is about 1/4 of the cost of bliss, and you can hear it up on the stove in a pan of water.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t spread as easily as I was hoping.</li>
      <li>The wax itself is fine.</li>
      <li>The person using the wax, however, not so fine.</li>
      <li>Super cheap!</li>
      <li>It pulls the hair from the root and makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
      <li>If you are new to trying to wax your own face</li>
      <li>Wax spreads on smoothly and hardens quickly.</li>
      <li>I wish I could find a better way to warm it up than I&#x27;m currently using</li>
      <li>Will order more very soon.</li>
      <li>Just put it on, let it cool and rip it off in a 45 degree angle.</li>
      <li>I bought this wax about 3 months ago because it had such good ratings.</li>
      <li>I boiled this in hot water, which was fine</li>
      <li>This one is igreat because it hardens and solidifies quickly</li>
      <li>but I think that has to do with me having to repeatedly go back and warm up the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>I bought this item worth</li>
      <li>Does it right the first time!</li>
      <li>This product is super easy to use, and works very well.. much easier than going to a spa every couple of weeks, I have the spa at home.</li>
      <li>I removed the tray and set it right on the heat source.</li>
      <li>I will start by saying I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I&#x27;m so happy with this wax I had to.</li>
      <li>so I never break out, hurts less than waxing and is so EASY!!</li>
      <li>My first thought &amp;#34;what in the world, why didn&#x27;t that hurt?&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>When the wax is hot, it&#x27;s like liquid gold.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than weekly visits to the salon!</li>
      <li>but this is first wax I have tried.</li>
      <li>The only other thing you need to buy is a wamer to warm up the wax :)</li>
      <li>When I WAS able to put it on the hair fast enough, it didn&#x27;t spread at all or work.</li>
      <li>Best stuff I&#x27;ve tried, must do a thick layer and have the proper wax warmer.</li>
      <li>Melts at the right temp (not too runny or hard), cools quickly, bonds together (easy to remove all with one muslin strip), and quick clean-up when drips happen.  </li>
      <li>easy to work with, no extra stickiness.</li>
      <li>I have tried several hair removers before and this is the only that was able to pull out the hairs!</li>
      <li>I was ready to throw the whole thing away before even using because it&#x27;s super sticky and messy but I am really glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>and I think I made the mistake of trying to stir too much.</li>
      <li>it really works</li>
      <li>,i tried this wax its really work for me ...</li>
      <li>and you can wax faster (and thus not feel as much pain).</li>
      <li>It dries too fast couldnt even remove</li>
      <li>You really need to know what you&#x27;re doing before you try this yourself.</li>
      <li>Hot wax works better than cooling down wax.</li>
      <li>They cool down quickly so be quick when applying.</li>
      <li>The older</li>
      <li>This product go there in great time, but it is very hard to use!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend if you already have a wax warmer.</li>
      <li>Great thought process behind it though!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not hard to use.</li>
      <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t really appreciate was the size of the container, but other than that it worked well and was easy to use.</li>
      <li>I lightly pressed down on the wax and then pulled it off...</li>
      <li>The upper lip is a smaller area, so it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>I love this hard wax.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft wax that feels like you&#x27;re ripping your skin off, because literally you are.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all naturally</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and now saves me about $40 a month! It&#x27;s all naturally so I never break out, hurts less than waxing and is so EASY!! And will last you forever! The only other thing you need to buy is a wamer to warm up the wax :) Super cheap!</li>
    <li> Great wax. I&#x27;ll keep buying once I finished the current can. They cool down quickly so be quick when applying.</li>
    <li> I bought this item worth the gig wax warmer with hopes to wax my legs and underarms.  When I received the wax, I was surprised at how small it was, for paying over $8.  There is essentially two small &amp;#34;shot glasses&amp;#34; of wax.  This may be a good item for someone looking to wax their eyebrows, but anything more will call for more wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned the warmer and the wax.  I&#x27;ll pay the $$ and go to the salon.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend if you already have a wax warmer. I boiled this in hot water, which was fine but I kept having to go back and reheat the product. Hot wax works better than cooling down wax. A little goes a long way especially when hot. You need to use a thicker and wider Popsicle stick to apply this product. The thin and small Popsicle applicators will doom you. It&#x27;s rather hard to control but I think that has to do with me having to repeatedly go back and warm up the product. When the wax is hot, it&#x27;s like liquid gold. No sticky residue left behind.</li>
    <li> I have tried to use other hair removal products.  This brand is the best in my opinion.  While waxing can be messy it takes practice to get the right consistency.  I use a LePetite warmer with a dial heat regulator.</li>
    <li> The best wax. It&#x27;s almost painless and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried other waxes and they were terrible. This one is igreat because it hardens and solidifies quickly so when you pull you get more hair and you can wax faster (and thus not feel as much pain).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this has so many good reviews. I heated it up, went to go use it....if you are using this you must be a pro or have perfect aim or something. It had hardened on the stick before I was able to even bring it up to my face. When I WAS able to put it on the hair fast enough, it didn&#x27;t spread at all or work. Pulling it off hurt, bad. Waste of money for me. If you are new to trying to wax your own face I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> You have to know what you&#x27;re doing otherwise you can hurt your skin. Used on my arm pits and upperlips. Worked great. Always prefer to use my finger to handle the wax, intead of those sticks they send witv the product, gives me more control. Will order more very soon.</li>
    <li> Wax spreads on smoothly and hardens quickly. I couldn&#x27;t yank it off like a strip, and it didn&#x27;t stick to the strips I had on hand. I remedied this by spreading it on slightly thicker than you normally spread wax and rolling it with my fingernail. Caught every hair! Unfortunately, by the time I had my method down, I had wasted most of the wax, but I had enough confidence in it that I just ordered another jar.&lt;br /&gt;It receives 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons: I received a 2 oz jar instead of the 4 oz I ordered. And I don&#x27;t have a warmer, and the metal container made it impossible to microwave. I was forced to heat it on the stove. A microwavable package would be more convenient.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Removes hair better than the bliss poetic wax, is about 1/4 of the cost of bliss, and you can hear it up on the stove in a pan of water. Additionally this is a lot of wax!!! Perfect alternative to bliss poetic wax.</li>
    <li> This product go there in great time, but it is very hard to use! Also very messy! Great thought process behind it though!</li>
    <li> Best wax for sensitive skin. I have used it for many years .</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate waxing myself but I am hairy and I am always needing to go to the salon. Aside from being expensive, it&#x27;s inconvenient. A beautician whose waxing never seemed to hurt me told me that hard wax only sticks to the hair, not your skin.  It&#x27;s soft wax that feels like you&#x27;re ripping your skin off, because literally you are. Just make sure to use it thick enough, if it&#x27;s too thin it will stick to your skin and hurt. I used it with a warmer and it all went well.</li>
    <li> The wax itself is fine. The person using the wax, however, not so fine. You really need to know what you&#x27;re doing before you try this yourself. It&#x27;s harder than it looks.</li>
    <li> I definitely love this wax. I read the reviews before buying it, and I&#x27;m so thankful of everyone who mentioned how perfect it is!&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to work with, no extra stickiness. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly, dries in seconds. Doesn&#x27;t really matter what direction I pull it off, it&#x27;s going to take serious hairs off. It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> it works......but this is first wax I have tried.</li>
    <li> it comes in a metal container w/o handles so it&#x27;s hard to heat.  Can&#x27;t microwave it and difficult to get out of boiling water.  No material strips provided to put on the wax once on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this and I definitely recommend this to the people who have unwanted hair !</li>
    <li> I will start by saying I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I&#x27;m so happy with this wax I had to. I bought this wax about 3 months ago because it had such good ratings. When it came I put it in my bathroom and tried to forget about it (waxing has never been one of my favorite things to do).  This morning though, I looked at my eyebrows and decided it was time:( I got the wax warm and applied it to my eyebrow. I lightly pressed down on the wax and then pulled it off... My first thought &amp;#34;what in the world, why didn&#x27;t that hurt?&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that fits my was warmer and I prefer it for hair removal.  It is becoming very hard to find.</li>
    <li> Wish I bought a bigger size!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not hard to use. I have tried several hair removers before and this is the only that was able to pull out the hairs! Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve tried, must do a thick layer and have the proper wax warmer.</li>
    <li> I am a trained cosmetologist, so I&#x27;ve used my share of waxes. This one is perfect for facial waxing. Love the fact I do not have to use strips, just let harden, flick the edge and pull off. This is the only brand I will use on myself.</li>
    <li> This product takes some time to heat up and melt to a pliable wax consistency. The texture is thick and can be somewhat difficult to manage when applying. However, once an even layer is applied, it does remove fine hair effectively. It works well on smaller areas. The lid has a tendency of getting stuck, so it would be advisable to not push it down completely when closing.</li>
    <li> I was ready to throw the whole thing away before even using because it&#x27;s super sticky and messy but I am really glad I didn&#x27;t. I used a mug warmer to heat and I think I made the mistake of trying to stir too much. Once I was able to apply some of the wax that was the right consistency (along the edge of the tin), I removed and found great results. Not a lot of pain, removed all hair it covered. Be careful when handling because some can be really hot. I think it will take a few times to get the hang of it but once you do, you&#x27;ll appreciate how effective it is.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 15 years on my eyebrows and love it. I have tried several other brands but this works the best and fits in my warmer perfect! The warmer is around $30, and the wax is roughly $10 and lasts for at least a year. Much cheaper than weekly visits to the salon!</li>
    <li> Been using it for years and still find it works best for me.  The older I get the more I like it for those annoying chin hairs.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this wax because it dried too quickly and when it did, it was difficult remove because it was clumpy. It didn&#x27;t spread as easily as I was hoping. It was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite wax, it works much better than the sally brand as well. It&#x27;s worth the money. I never buy any other brand of wax for my eyebrows, this is just perfect and the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 30 years and it works! I&#x27;ve tried other products over the years but always come back to No-Tweeze.</li>
    <li> As Goldilocks said, &amp;#34;This one is just right!&amp;#34;  Melts at the right temp (not too runny or hard), cools quickly, bonds together (easy to remove all with one muslin strip), and quick clean-up when drips happen.  Does it right the first time!</li>
    <li> I followed the instruction, however, when I apply it into my leg, it won&#x27;t came off quickly, so I have to do it slowly and it took me about 2 hours to finish 1 leg only, so hurt and painful!. Good thing is the hair came off, so you can feel your skin is smooth. I&#x27;m a bit afraid to use it again now, so probably I have to throw it away :(</li>
    <li> It dries really quickly so you have to use it a few times before you get the hang of how to use it.  I use it with a wax warmer which helps keep it melted while using.  It pulls the hair from the root and makes my skin feel so smooth. Best wax I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I hate that I have to wax out hairs but this is probably one of my favorite waxes.  I&#x27;ve used sugar wax and regular hard wax but neither seem to get out stubborn hairs.  This one does the job.  I wish I could find a better way to warm it up than I&#x27;m currently using but it works.</li>
    <li> no, i &#x27;ve tried this product years  ago and it worked well, the best wax ever.But now it&#x27;s not he same like  ever thing else cheaper product. NO GOOD, CHANGED THE WAX TO SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT WORK !!! and i bought 2.....</li>
    <li> It brakes if you are not fast would like a different one but overall it works</li>
    <li> This stuff is a GODSEND. I have sensitive skin, and I was ready to just rock caterpillars if it came down to me tweezing anymore. So I ordered this stuff in one last try to tame my brows. Let me tell you. This stuff is WAY less painful than tweezing. All I did was set it on a candle wax warmer, like from Yankee Candle; the little pot thing with the little removable tray on top. I removed the tray and set it right on the heat source. Melted in 15 minutes or so.</li>
    <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t really appreciate was the size of the container, but other than that it worked well and was easy to use. I enjoyed the fact that it was made from bee&#x27;s wax.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the size,  the product was great. :-)</li>
    <li> The product is not at all workable and is not any means of effective, my wife applied this and she didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;She bought a new from different store. This product is of no use.&lt;br /&gt;How to return the product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I think it is much better than wax strips. Pulls out even tiny hair</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome it really works i use it weeky i will be buying more</li>
    <li> Being a woman with facial hair is exhausting. I have a low fuss beauty regimen, so I usually only use facial wax when my mustache starts getting thick or I start growing a beard. So, basically every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that you don&#x27;t need strips to use this wax. Just put it on, let it cool and rip it off in a 45 degree angle. I&#x27;ve tried to use it for my eyebrows but it can be a little messy and I usually pull off too much hair. So now, I only use it remove hair about my upper lip and hair that grows on my chin and neck. It&#x27;s wax, so there is some pain involved. It&#x27;s tolerable for me, but my mother couldn&#x27;t take it. The upper lip is a smaller area, so it&#x27;s not bad. But, I do have to brace myself for the neck, since it can be difficult to remove all of that hair at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to remove the wax, without pulling it off, for some reason you&#x27;ll have to ice it off.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin i used all hair removeal product but no use ,i tried this wax its really work for me ... great product....</li>
    <li> This product is super easy to use, and works very well.. much easier than going to a spa every couple of weeks, I have the spa at home.</li>
    <li> It dries too fast couldnt even remove it had to heat up the spot to get it off. It could have possibly ripped my skin.</li>
