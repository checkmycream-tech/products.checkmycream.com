      <li>Love this product, it is easy to put on, creamy but not too creamy and pigmented.</li>

      <li>its so easy to apply</li>

      <li>Well as promised it goes on easily</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just so smooth and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>that it goes on easily and precisely, and 2. is waterproof and therefore can be used on the waterline without running.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a SOFT liner that is great for a quick eye line or a softer wing.  </li>
      <li>so I say enjoy it while it lasts.</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t order this from Amazon, got it at Target, but was so excited I wanted to add a review here- just for full disclosure)</li>
      <li>Kudos to Amazon as well for a fast delivery :)</li>
      <li>But since I did love it so much I bought it again and threw away my other.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wear it daily even during my work outs, it is very glam and has great staying power.</li>
      <li>as advertised, and quick shipping</li>
      <li>Removes nicely when cleaning your face, no dark shadows which is surprising because it is so awesomely black.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about this quality.</li>
      <li>This crayon is worth</li>
      <li>This is very simple to use and gives a nice chunky line.</li>
      <li>Goes on so smooth and rich you cam use on the waterline and will stay on for a long time but because it is not waterproof any mistakes are an easy fix with a damp Q-tip</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to bother with a sharpener and the price is right.</li>
      <li>so creamy and smooth, easy to apply and last for hours!!!</li>
      <li>thank you all very much.</li>
      <li>i still prefer bobbi brown crème liner, so far it is the easiest and lasts the longest but this is fine too</li>
      <li>I need a couple more actually.</li>
      <li>I love to use this on my upper and lower waterlines as well as sometimes on the eyelid to smudge out for a smokey eye.</li>
      <li>Color is deep and sexy looking.</li>
      <li>Could have gotten eyeliner at my local beauty store for $1, it certainly works better than this,  The commercials for this product was overly photoshopped.</li>
      <li>Exactly as it looks on T.V. Glides on perfectly smooth and makes a nice thick line.</li>
      <li>Makes a pro cat eye flick, smudges nicely if you want to do that too, and is a real deal black.</li>
      <li>i think I expected more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for filling in after using a thin liquid liner has already made the outline of a stronger cat eye.</li>
      <li>I expected more from tbis product.</li>
      <li>The seller did however throw in a second one for free.</li>
      <li>I got this eyeliner in Midnight Brown and really like it.</li>
      <li>I really like the ease of application.</li>
      <li>She didn&#x27;t use eyeliner for sometime because of her sensitive eyes and had tried all she came across without much success.</li>
      <li>I wear glasses with a fairly strong prescription, so I wear eyeliner every day in order to make sure my eyes don&#x27;t disappear behind my glasses.  </li>
      <li>This is my new favourite, I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline Gel liner for years</li>
      <li>This automatically goes to my can&#x27;t live without list.</li>
      <li>Maybe Maybelline wanted to create a product you can&#x27;t live without, but think twice about this.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be buying a new one every month.</li>
      <li>I like this product and it was delivered early!</li>
      <li>I can wipe it off easily even after it has dried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a soft liner.  </li>
      <li>Maybelline makes no sharpener for this product as far as I know, so there is no way to sharpen it after the point starts to disappear and widen.  </li>
      <li>No... with cosmetics, you nearly always get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Soft liner and time with under eye &#x3D; smear.  </li>
      <li>Can apply lightly for day and do a heavy application for drama at night!</li>
      <li>If you mess your wing up, a Q-tip and some spit fix that right away.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t dry out while applying, so you can build up with out making a huge mess of your line.</li>
      <li>Bought it for my wife as she couldn&#x27;t try regular eye liner because of sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d stay it stays about as well as any other liner, and for the price... do people on here really think that it&#x27;s going to have &amp;</li>
      <li>This goes on smoothly and is much easier to apply than liquid eyeliner, so if you are wanting the thick black line, try this before a liquid eyeliner!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually quite happy with this eyeliner! I have the black (Onyx)- perhaps the other negative reviews were for the charcoal or other colors? I have nooo problem with pulling or tugging in the least. I&#x27;m a makeup snob, and have VERY few items from &amp;#34;just&amp;#34; the drugstore but my eyeliner obsession pushes me to trying them all. This one is a winner. The tip is pretty thick- so it makes it great for lining the lid, the waterline and even smudging on the lower waterline. It&#x27;s also great for filling in after using a thin liquid liner has already made the outline of a stronger cat eye. I&#x27;d stay it stays about as well as any other liner, and for the price... do people on here really think that it&#x27;s going to have &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; staying power of 24 hours?! No... with cosmetics, you nearly always get what you pay for. (I didn&#x27;t order this from Amazon, got it at Target, but was so excited I wanted to add a review here- just for full disclosure)</li>
    <li> THIS IS AWESOME EYELINER! Also you can put it inside your bottom eye lid. Above your bottom lashes and it doesn&#x27;t make eyes water or burn and stays put!</li>
    <li> Could have gotten eyeliner at my local beauty store for $1, it certainly works better than this,  The commercials for this product was overly photoshopped.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I read an article on Refinery 29 that talked about the best drugstore makeup that MUA&#x27;s recommend. (make up artists) I pretty much bought everything on the list, since I&#x27;ve been going a little overboard on the expensive stuff from Sephora lately, and I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. This is no exception. This is very simple to use and gives a nice chunky line. It&#x27;s really nice for getting the waterline and makes a great cat eye. This goes on smoothly and is much easier to apply than liquid eyeliner, so if you are wanting the thick black line, try this before a liquid eyeliner! I would recommend this! Can apply lightly for day and do a heavy application for drama at night!</li>
    <li> Definitely the Master! This is my new favourite, I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline Gel liner for years but when I saw this on the magazine I searched it on Amazon and BOOM! It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to blend - from No make-up make-up to Smokey eyes! You just need to be extra careful when using it, it looks so delicate. This automatically goes to my can&#x27;t live without list. Kudos to Amazon as well for a fast delivery :)</li>
    <li> This crayon is worth the price cause its so easy to apply and you just need a little bit.</li>
    <li> Goes in easy. Nice color</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife as she couldn&#x27;t try regular eye liner because of sensitive eyes. She didn&#x27;t use eyeliner for sometime because of her sensitive eyes and had tried all she came across without much success. She loves this and regularly wears it now. She says it doesn&#x27;t hurt or make her eyes watery but still gives a good highlight. Just what she was looking for.</li>
    <li> love love love this eyeliner!! so creamy and smooth, easy to apply and last for hours!!! will buy again</li>
    <li> Tip was off and pressed inside cover</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long on the lower lids as other brands.  I&#x27;ve had a much better experience with Rimmel.</li>
    <li> Goes on so smooth and rich you cam use on the waterline and will stay on for a long time but because it is not waterproof any mistakes are an easy fix with a damp Q-tip</li>
    <li> I love how easy this eyeliner is to use. Unfortunately, even with primer, it smears big time.</li>
    <li> Hard to use and not very smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it is easy to put on, creamy but not too creamy and pigmented. It will stay on. I love to use this on my upper and lower waterlines as well as sometimes on the eyelid to smudge out for a smokey eye.</li>
    <li> This liner is horrible.  Not only is it hard to apply &amp;#34;sideways&amp;#34; as it says you should, but it smudges HORRIBLY!  I put it on before work, and was so embarrassed the next time I went to the bathroom and I had the WORST raccoon eyes.  Absolutely disappointing and stupid concept.</li>
    <li> I like this product and it was delivered early! Awesome!</li>
    <li> I got this eyeliner in Midnight Brown and really like it. It&#x27;s creamy and easy to apply and can be smudged if you want, all especially nice for those of us who do not see well without our glasses on. You don&#x27;t have to bother with a sharpener and the price is right.</li>
    <li> i think I expected more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this, it broke on the second day :( I don&#x27;t think I can use it again..</li>
    <li> I really like the ease of application. The shape is awesome. I do have to re-apply a couple of times a day though.</li>
    <li> Loved it I have to order another one..</li>
    <li> I wear glasses with a fairly strong prescription, so I wear eyeliner every day in order to make sure my eyes don&#x27;t disappear behind my glasses.  I bought this liner for the two things it promised, 1. that it goes on easily and precisely, and 2. is waterproof and therefore can be used on the waterline without running.  Well as promised it goes on easily but unfortunately within minutes of application and without touching it the liner smudges EVERYWHERE.  And in case you didn&#x27;t already guess, it&#x27;s not waterproof either.  I applied it to my waterline and before I could even move from one eye to the other, it was dissolving away.  This liner was a huge fail and went into the trash.</li>
    <li> One of my goto liners. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner.Unlike other smaller eye pencils,this product lasts for a very long time.Only need to apply once also.</li>
    <li> Dig this Kajal! I have two blacks and a blue and if I could find the dark purple anywhere I would get it.</li>
    <li> I expected more from tbis product.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever used</li>
    <li> Thanks all items are wonderful thank you all very much.</li>
    <li> Terrible liner. Smudges within minutes of application. Pulls on your eyelids. Very very disappointed with this liner. Do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner makes a good first impression.  Easy to apply, looks good on.  However.  Maybelline makes no sharpener for this product as far as I know, so there is no way to sharpen it after the point starts to disappear and widen.  Your lines will be thicker, application will be more difficult.  After buying this TWICE, I realize that I have to keep twisting (while applying!) and alternating which side of the crayon I use to keep some semblance of a point.  And, as other reviewers have said, it is not waterproof.  Maybe Maybelline wanted to create a product you can&#x27;t live without, but think twice about this.  You&#x27;ll be buying a new one every month.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this quality. The seller did however throw in a second one for free. This does not stay on my eyes very long. I need something that is more smear proof and water proof.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its this product or the supplier but this gave me an eye infection. I&#x27;m almost tempted to try it from Rite Aid or something but afraid of getting another infection.</li>
    <li> I saw this eyeliner in a magazine and went on line to order it. What a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on so smooth and easy. The best soft eyeliner I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> i still prefer bobbi brown crème liner, so far it is the easiest and lasts the longest but this is fine too</li>
    <li> Works as well as any other Kohl liner on my waterline.</li>
    <li> Exactly as it looks on T.V. Glides on perfectly smooth and makes a nice thick line. Only bad thing is that it doesn&#x27;t sharpen and it tells you on the back of the package to apply on the side to keep the sharpness.</li>
    <li> This liner goes on smoothly and it looks great.  Not sure what I will do when the point starts to dull.</li>
    <li> Great color. But does run a little by the end of the day. And it was a little odd that the pencil base does not twist more product out.</li>
    <li> Goes on very easy. Color is deep and sexy looking. Will definitely purchase it gain.</li>
    <li> Bought this liner months ago and LOVED it but once point rounds after several uses its harder to apply and harder to control. But since I did love it so much I bought it again and threw away my other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t sharpen the point so I say enjoy it while it lasts.</li>
    <li> I like this. It works better than a pencil and you can make the line quite fine. It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take any time at all.</li>
    <li> as advertised, and quick shipping</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Easy to use!!</li>
    <li> I read a bunch of reviews before I bought this so I thought I would return the favor.  For what it is, this liner is great.  It&#x27;s a SOFT liner that is great for a quick eye line or a softer wing.  They advertise it great for an under eye application.  I don&#x27;t think I would agree with that.  It&#x27;s a soft liner.  Soft liner and time with under eye &#x3D; smear.  BUT as a top liner this is great for work.  I bought the brown.  Perfect for a day look.  I&#x27;m going to get the black next.  It&#x27;s just so smooth and easy to apply.  If you mess your wing up, a Q-tip and some spit fix that right away.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t dry out while applying, so you can build up with out making a huge mess of your line. I buy expensive and drug store make up.  This is a win in my book.</li>
    <li> I wear it daily even during my work outs, it is very glam and has great staying power. Makes a pro cat eye flick, smudges nicely if you want to do that too, and is a real deal black. Removes nicely when cleaning your face, no dark shadows which is surprising because it is so awesomely black. Luv it! I need a couple more actually.</li>
    <li> Nothing what I expected at all horrible runny eye liner. Wears of in hours</li>
    <li> Really disappointed in this eyeliner. Difficult to apply as it pulls on the eyelid. Has to be applied several times to make it dark enough. Has zero staying ability and will smear off below the eyes within an hour of application. Also will rub off on skin below brow line after application to lid. Very poor quality kohl liner!</li>
    <li> its really great but its not as lush as the tv comartials but tottaly recomend</li>
    <li> I would say that this is the most best eyeliner and also it&#x27;s actually dark when u put it on so if ur looking 4 a Gothic look I would say this is the one...:) chow</li>
    <li> Love the effect on my eyes.</li>
    <li> This product said it was waterproof, but it is not. I can wipe it off easily even after it has dried. Also goes on dark grey, not black. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works great after a coupke uses to soften it up.  Im getting another</li>
    <li> Look good, I love your brush.</li>
    <li> Great liner!  Gives impact and holds up!</li>
