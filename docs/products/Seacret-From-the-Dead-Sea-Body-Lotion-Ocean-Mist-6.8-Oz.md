      <li>I liked it; it felt very silky and had a fresh, clean smell.</li>
      <li>My skin went from dry to moisturised and looked and felt great.</li>
      <li>I was given a sample of this product in Key West, and loved it-</li>

    <li> I have used this hand lotion for several years and like it very much.</li>
    <li> I tried this at a friends house and had to go and buy my own.  It provides a feeling other creams that i have tried don&#x27;t, very smooth and kind of slick, but not greasy</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS JUST AS ADVERTISED.  NICE AROMA AND GOOD SIZE.  VERY GOOD FOR SKIN ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WITH ALLERGIES.  WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased this in Adelaide. I just enjoy the product and the fragrance. I will definitely purchase again. I had believed I was purchasing this from Australia so was a little lax in not realising the price was in American dollars and of course the postage was very expensive. However it was still cheaper than purchasing from an Adelaide store supplier.</li>
    <li> Secret from the dead sea products are great! This lotion feels like silk on your skin, and is very moisturizing. Ive been using it now for 3 1/2 year. The ocean scent, and cucumber scents are the best!</li>
    <li> My husband bougnt this lotion for me for Christmas and we both love it..it makes my skin very smooth and moisturized.  My husband liked it so much that when I asked him what he wanted for his Brithday..he said,\\&quot;More of that Seacret lotion.\\&quot;  Thanks for such a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion. I even got my manly rough handed husband to use it and he&#x27;s hooked. Mainly bc of the great response from me now that the callouses are gone, but who cares.

    <li> I was not happy with this one tube as it was runney and the other ones I have had were not.. It&#x27;s a good Lotion but would&lt;br /&gt;not order again unless I knew it was a thicker Lotion. Janet Moore</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this product in Key West, and loved it- mainly b/c it does not leave a greasy residue on my hands.  The scent is also soo light and summery.  So glad I found it on Amazon (it is sold for $20 on the website!)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  I first found it at a kiosk at the mall and was very happy to find it offered at Amazon.com at an even better price.  The lotion is very moisturing and the Ocean scent I buy smells wonderful.  I have three granddaughters who use it after their baths when they come to visit and love it too.

    <li> This is a very moisterizing lotion and it also has a fabulous clean scent as well. It is a very good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I have been using this product for years. The recent ones I have gotten were more expensive and runny not thick like it originally was. Will not buy this item again using this site.</li>
    <li> This is my second order, of the same product. Because of it&#x27;s low price, the first order was me checking out the product to be sure it was exactly as advertised. It was, so I ordered more. Love the Seacret and love this store!</li>
    <li> This body lotion is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  The emollients refresh your skin and do not leave an oily residue.  This really refreshed our sunburn after a day at the beach.</li>
    <li> I thought i was receiving the bottle in the image of the picture but i received some other seacret lotion. Image is false advertising. i wanted that specific lotion.</li>
    <li> At a shopping mall I had been given a sample of Seacret Hand Lotion--\\&quot;The Ocean\\&quot; fragrance.  I liked it; it felt very silky and had a fresh, clean smell. When I went back to the kiosk where I had gotten the sample, they didn&#x27;t have any of the product for sale. I guess it had sold out. So I went on line to search for it. I wound up buying a tube of the body lotion. It doesn&#x27;t seem as silky as the sample did, but the scent is great. I gather that it&#x27;s marketed to women. I&#x27;m a guy, but I like it anyway. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume smell, just, to repeat myself, a clean scent. I don&#x27;t like or use colognes. I find them too over-powering.</li>
    <li> I love Seacret Lotion, however this particular one I received is very runny.  Others I have received have been firmer almost like a toothpaste when getting out of tube.  This one, I barely open the cap and turn it upside down and it comes streaming out.  Not happy about that.</li>
    <li> I now only use Seacret body lotions.........LOVE IT.  Your skin feels SO smooth and not greasy.  Best I have ever used. Had purchased originally in mall but online is so much cheaper for the same product.  Also, highly suggest using the foot cream as well.</li>
    <li> The lotion I received doesn&#x27;t appear to be the same product as pictured or shown in the mall. The lotion I got was runny and did not penetrate my skin as a more thicker lotion would. For the price it was definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> It was sent as a gift and the person loved it.  They had used it before and still enjoyed the scent and feel.</li>
    <li> I like the Seacret Ocean Mist ok, but I had Seacret Body Lotion and I liked that better. It&#x27;s not as runny as the Mist. I had ordered the &amp;#34;Body Lotion&amp;#34; but received the Body Lotion Mist. I don&#x27;t know if you no longer carry the &amp;#34;Seacret Body Lotion&amp;#34; only. Please let me know. Thank you. You were helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Beverly Baraw</li>
    <li> I like the scent of the cream, and also the fact that it absorbs into the skin, and does not leave an oily residue...</li>
    <li> very dissappointed. you picture the body lotion I have purchased and loved . you send the mist instead.I do not like it as well and would not wish to have received the more inferior product in its place.</li>
    <li> Love this product, bought it in the mall for 4 times this amount, so happy I found it here and now I will buy it here all the time :)</li>
    <li> I bought this same product before from the mall. It had different packaging. It was amazing. When I received this one, it was nothing in comparison. Felt and even smelled differently.</li>
    <li> Love the body lotion Seacret from the Dead Sea. I saw results with in 3 days of using it. My skin went from dry to moisturised and looked and felt great. Wish it was more affordable, but worth every penny when you can buy it :)</li>
