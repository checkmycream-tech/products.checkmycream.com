      <li>/&gt;You can use this oil so many different ways to help you breathe better.&lt;br</li>

      <li>This brand offers larger size bottles which are great if you use your essential oils a lot.</li>
      <li>I will say that this Sun brand eucalyptus oil doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite as strong as others that I&#x27;ve tried, so I think I&#x27;ll stick to using it in my diffuser, not risk using it topically, since it may be diluted</li>
      <li>This Eucalyptus oil is of very high quality.</li>
      <li>can all be treated with a gentle massage of eucalyptus oil.</li>
      <li>can all be treated with a gentle massage of eucalyptus oil.</li>
      <li>Eucalyptus is one of my favorite essential oils because of how fresh it smells plus the long list of benefits you get from using it.</li>
      <li>It really helps me clear my mind and focus on the tasks in front of me.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Reduce inflammation and open airways by inhaling directly from the bottle, massaging one drop over the sinuses, or applying as a hot compress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I had to use a whole ottle to get the same effect I would have used one quarter for my soaps.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>Just a tiny bit (one or two drops carefully straight from the bottle or using some that I’ve diluted with fractionated coconut oil) placed under my nose does wonders.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Its antiviral and antibacterial properties naturally make cleaning among one of the eucalyptus oil</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soothing, I used a couple of drops in an oil diffuser and left it on all night.</li>
      <li>Also, inhale the aroma directly or diffuse in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can also rub this directly into your skin.</li>
      <li>oil is a natural pain reliever, it will help with inflammation.</li>
      <li>Not too much, one or two, otherwise it can sting a little in combination with hot water.</li>
      <li>eucalyptus oil uses include cooling the body (above), using 1-2 drops during a high fever can help the body regulate its temperature and support its efforts in fighting</li>
      <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll need a new bottle for several years!</li>
      <li>the lungs to clear by diffusing constantly and massaging directly over the lungs.</li>
      <li>I’ve become a big fan of essential oils over the last few months since I’ve started building up my own personal collection.</li>
      <li>the lungs to clear by diffusing constantly and massaging directly over the lungs.</li>
      <li>on the type of pain, consider massaging several drops into the reflex points of the feet or directly over the area of concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>on the type of pain, consider massaging several drops into the reflex points of the feet or directly over the area of concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They include a plastic pipette, but I do really wish there were a glass dropper built into the bottle lid (like other brands I’ve tried), since these plastic ones get gummed up over time and can get messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love to sniff it straight from the bottle when my nasal passages are stopped up, and to put a few drops onto a wet washcloth (either cold or warm, depending on your preference) to place on my head when I lie down.</li>
      <li>but seriously i&#x27;d recommend this product even if it wasn&#x27;t free</li>
      <li>/&gt;I’ve found that eucalyptus oil is amazing at helping to decrease nasal congestion when my allergies are acting up and especially during cold and flu season.</li>

    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried on my skin, but it smells wonderful.  I purchased it to put into a Banksia cone -- to provide a nice scent to a room or closet.</li>
    <li> Eucalyptus is one of my favorite essential oils because of how fresh it smells plus the long list of benefits you get from using it. I prefer using this in the afternoon after work to wind down before taking on my daily household responsibilities. It really helps me clear my mind and focus on the tasks in front of me. Eucalyptus is also great for disinfecting cuts and respiratory problems. I love that Sun Organic&#x27;s oils are 100% natural and all organic.

    <li> Used it up already...will have to get more.</li>
    <li> Seems weak and overly diluted to me too, and I also would have preferred a glass dropper to the useless pipette, which is especially annoying given that the bottle&#x27;s neck is too large for my spare droppers. I ordered it from Amazon because of the convenience, but I will buy it from my regular supplier from now on.</li>
    <li> I like the eucalyptus scent but it is better mixed with lemon than as a stand alone fragrance. I might experiment and see what else it mixes well with.</li>
    <li> I got this for free! Natural essential oil, nice smelling and perfect for a diffuser, homemade soap or laundry detergent!</li>
    <li> This Eucalyptus oil is of very high quality. I love the way it makes my popourri smell. It helps me after I have been feeling sick to get better faster. I enjoy the quality of this product.</li>

    <li> I gave this 4 stars as bottle does not state where it was manufactured. Do Not take internally, read the bottle. Always read up up on safety warnings when using any oils. Wonderful aroma that I use as a room freshener.  Gives an outdoor feel to it.  Comes with a plastic bulb type dropper that has measurements on it. Thought I would give some helpful hints on using Eucalyptus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arterial Vasodilator&lt;br /&gt;Use 1 drop during massage over any area of concern. (Massage also increase circulation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asthma&lt;br /&gt;Massage 1-2 drops over the chest regularly. Also, inhale the aroma directly or diffuse in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brain Blood Flow&lt;br /&gt;Diffuse throughout the home or classroom to increase circulation to the brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bronchitis&lt;br /&gt;Use topically or aromatically, massaging into the chest, back and throat, inhaling from a steam tent, or dropping the oil on the shirt collar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congestion&lt;br /&gt;One of the more popular eucalyptus oil uses; try a steam tent or diffuse as needed. Massage over the chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coughs&lt;br /&gt;Diffuse throughout the room throughout the span of the illness, but also massage into the reflex points of the feet as well as over the chest, back, and throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diabetes&lt;br /&gt;Because of the vasodilation mention above, using eucalyptus on a daily basis can increase circulation, a common issue for diabetics. I recommend massaging it into the body with lotion after each shower, as the massage will also help increase circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disinfectant&lt;br /&gt;Its antiviral and antibacterial properties naturally make cleaning among one of the eucalyptus oil uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dysentery&lt;br /&gt;Massage 2 drops of eucalyptus over the abdomen in a counter-clockwise direction to ease diarrhea, inflammation, and fight infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ear Inflammation&lt;br /&gt;Never put essential oil IN the ear canal! However, you can massage the oil on and around the outer ear.

    <li> I’ve become a big fan of essential oils over the last few months since I’ve started building up my own personal collection. Eucalyptus oil is one of my favorites, so I was happy to order this 2 ounce bottle from Sun Essential Oils to try out. They include a plastic pipette, but I do really wish there were a glass dropper built into the bottle lid (like other brands I’ve tried), since these plastic ones get gummed up over time and can get messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve found that eucalyptus oil is amazing at helping to decrease nasal congestion when my allergies are acting up and especially during cold and flu season. Just a tiny bit (one or two drops carefully straight from the bottle or using some that I’ve diluted with fractionated coconut oil) placed under my nose does wonders. The inhaled aromas help to break up that awful congestion so I can breathe easier! I will say that this Sun brand eucalyptus oil doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite as strong as others that I&#x27;ve tried, so I think I&#x27;ll stick to using it in my diffuser, not risk using it topically, since it may be diluted already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that I was able to order this as a free promotional sample in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.</li>
    <li> I love this Eucalyptus oil. This oil comes in an 2 ounce bottle and comes with a plastic dropper to dispense the oil. This oil is perfect to diffuse when someone in your house gets a cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this oil so many different ways to help you breathe better.&lt;br /&gt;This is a few:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use in your diffuser&lt;br /&gt;Put a couple of drops on your pillow&lt;br /&gt;Make melting disc to use in the shower. (Tons of tutorials online)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great oil to use around the house and is a great value.  I would recommend for anyone dealing with colds and congestion. I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
    <li> I love this, I put it in the well in my steamer.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I had to use a whole ottle to get the same effect I would have used one quarter for my soaps.</li>
    <li> I love Eucalyptus oil. I find it has a lot of medicinal value for headaches and colds. When I mix it with peppermint oil it can knock out a migraine. I will pour a couple of drops in my bath water as well. Not too much, one or two, otherwise it can sting a little in combination with hot water. I usually buy Oils for NOW foods. This was better priced and the quality is just as good.</li>
    <li> awesome smell got this free for giving a good review but seriously i&#x27;d recommend this product even if it wasn&#x27;t free</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these oils haven&#x27;t found one yet I don&#x27;t like. I was lucky enough to review this product at no cost to give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I got this product on a promotional price in exchange for an honest unbiased review.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Im a big Essential Oil fanatic well, This Eucalyptus oil is truly the best when it comes to clearing the sinuses and easing the tension of colds and flu. I love to sniff it straight from the bottle when my nasal passages are stopped up, and to put a few drops onto a wet washcloth (either cold or warm, depending on your preference) to place on my head when I lie down. It is quite strong, which is great. I doubt I&#x27;ll need a new bottle for several years! It is also great to smell if you have a queasy stomach. I grew up smelling camphor when ever I had an upset stomach, but have now switched to this product. It&#x27;s amazing! &amp;#34; its also clearing sinuses, easing headaches. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this. It&#x27;s Sooo watered down. I put a ton into my defused and can&#x27;t smell it at all. I am going to try to return it. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I like this oil alot i just started with collecting oils and this one was well worth it good size and strong smell</li>
    <li> Comparable to the much more expensive brands! This is a GREAT deal and the quality is awesome!</li>
    <li> These are great to use to cleanse the air in your home. I love using oils in my diffuser to change the mood of my household. This ones calms the household and gives it a earthly type of smell. Mixing this oil with a carrier oil is said to be good for pain aches. Researching the oils and finding out their usage are always great if you want to truly use a natural way of easing one&#x27;s aliments. They do not cure anything but they do help ease depending on the oil. Always test your skin with small drop to see if you are allergic. I won this in a giveaway so that made me even more happy!</li>
    <li> I remember years back I would make my ​floral arrangements and would always add some eucalyptus to the vase, I just loved the smell that came of the arrangement. It also lasted a long time before I had to replace it. Eucalyptus oil has anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, decongestant, deodorant, antiseptic, antibacterial, stimulating, and other medicinal qualities. It can be used in room fresheners, soaps, deodorants and antiseptics. It is also an insect repellant and can be used to cure and treat lice infestations.&lt;br /&gt;This is another one of those items to keep in the medicine cabinet, for when the cold comes along and you need to clear up those sinuses. I received a bottle for review and was not monetarily compensated for my review.</li>
    <li> Took a chance but not what I looking for - as stated in other reviews, seems to be very watered down.</li>
    <li> When  you are not feeling well;  I suggest you boil some water with some Eucalyptus oil and let the steak  spread,&lt;br /&gt;over the house.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and will buy again from this shipper.</li>
    <li> Even came with a dropper.</li>
