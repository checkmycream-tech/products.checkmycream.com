    <li> I love baby tous for my kids</li>
    <li> im love this baby perfume because smells so good my baby girl love this perfume the prce are incredible excelent seller super fast shipping</li>
    <li> I bought this after having worn Eau de Rochas for a while. I wanted a little change. Had I not broken the bottle by accidentally dropping it, I think the fragrance would have had a lot more staying power (I have to use it as a splash now.) It is very light and refreshing (like Nenuco, yet more elegant and hip.) I am going to try it with the Tous Baby cream oil to layer it with because I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t last on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - love it! It gets four stars because I have to re-apply often. Eau de Rochas seemed to cling all day.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend and she was so happy.!</li>
    <li> I purchase this colongne for my 1 year old and my 4 year love the smell, perfect for babies and toddlers I really recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use it on my son and we get compliments all the time on how good he smells.  Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my kids but use it myself. It has a crisp, clean, fresh scent.  Love it!  Perfect for boys and girls, regardless of the age.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 2 year old daughter (even though I think this is meant for little boys) who loves to pretend to be a &amp;#34;big girl&amp;#34; like mommy. She wanted her own perfume and I saw this and thought it would be perfect. She loves the little bear bottle (it&#x27;s glass, so I make sure she&#x27;s careful with it and I help her hold it) and the packaging is darling. The soft nightcap comes off to revel the sprayer. It also comes with a little booklet which is an illustrated bedtime story. My daughter never wants to put the bottle away after she&#x27;s sprayed her perfume, so I tell her we have to put &amp;#34;Baby Tous&amp;#34; back to sleep. She places him gently back in his box and I put him back on the shelf for next time. She loves &amp;#34;Baby Tous&amp;#34; and I am very happy I found something she likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance itself is light and soft, very age appropriate for small ones. One or two sprays is enough to last all day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter &amp; the smell is very soft.  Perfect scent for a Baby/toddler &amp; boy/girl.  It does last all day also. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> First time using this product. We loved the smell of my daughter after a shower, we will spray it twice on her hair and last till the next day.</li>
    <li> Not too strong but you can still smell it when you sit and move. It&#x27; good for summer. Fresh and lovely.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with that perfume !!! I love Tous and perfumes by them are always amazing!Def i will buy it again</li>
    <li> Really delicious cologne</li>
    <li> My baby girl loves it for its light fragrance :)</li>
    <li> Fresh smell. Baby tous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it, Smell so fresh, no baby powder smell. The smell stays good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this perfume for a baby boy is perfect</li>
    <li> I am pregnant and this is the only perfume I am able to tolerate! Such a sweet baby scent. I receive many compliments and will continue to buy this until it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love this fragance, my son and I use it and both of us smell so good!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery!!! The fragrance is amazing.... I think this fragrance is geared towards adults. You can probably use the fragrance on a much older child.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter since she was born. The smell is so so nice!</li>
    <li> The smell is delicious but is quite strong for babies/toddlers. I will not use it in my daughter.</li>

    <li> Just got this in the mail to give to my 4 year old son, opened and sparyed it on him and you hardly notice the scent at all.Just compared to the same bottle he has as this and I knew its a fake..The original bottle he got as a gift  is noticeable from 3 feet. This one i just got from amazon  you literally have to put your nose up to his shirt. bull waste of money I&#x27;m never buying cologne from amazon ever again you lost my trust.</li>
