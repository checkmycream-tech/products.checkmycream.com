    <li> Perfect magnification.  It&#x27;s great to be able to move it around the counter without worrying about a cord.</li>
    <li> I had a fabulous lighted vanity mirror but it had a cord and was bulky so I bought this one. The &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; part was close in size but the 1/2&amp;#34; difference definitely made a difference. You can do your eye make up but the close up is basically one part of your face at a time (the other one allows you to see the whole front of your face on the close up setting). Still not having a cord is extremely helpful on the counter and so I kept it and am adjusting to using it. I just wished it had a slightly wider circumference for the mirror.</li>
    <li> Very nice and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Batteries loose, not snug enough to make contact...won&#x27;t light half the time...finally wedged something between batteries and hatch and that&#x27;s helped.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mirror, with good magnification and good lighting.  I like that it is battery operated, and therefore portable.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected! It successed my thought as to what it does and is very stylish in my new bathroom!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grown daughter and she loves it.  Happy that it fits nicely on her counter in the bathroom and it is coreless.  Looks great.</li>
    <li> The lights are a little dim. Overall, I like it a lot. Not having a cord to deal with is great.</li>
    <li> Just the right size without the hassle of wires. The LED lights provide good viewing. The pivoting mirror moves easily.</li>
    <li> Light in this mirror circles the mirror but does not reflect light onto the mirror as I expected,  It is a nice mirror and I use it....with help from additional lighting.</li>
    <li> Nice lighted mirror, works well on my vanity.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. The light quality is terrible. Mirror is small.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after minimal use over the period of about 6 months.</li>
    <li> Light, no cord, easy to use.  What more could you want. Move this product.</li>
    <li> Not the mirror for me.  After getting it home and trying it, just not what I wanted.  Going to look for something bigger.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, it works pretty much as you&#x27;d expect.  The quality is pretty good.  Its a bit expensive for what it is but so were the other choices.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way! Looks great, works great! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift for my sister. She loves it!</li>
    <li> This mirror is great, I love that it is cordless and can be place anywhere on the vanity because there is no cord to deal with.  Great to use for putting on makeup or doing eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This is a great vanity mirror; exactly as advertised, the cordless feature is the best!</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with the mirror and uses it regularly.</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy to use. I&#x27;m very glad I got the one that is cordless.</li>
    <li> really nice gift and was enjoyed so much. Mirror can be easily be moved form place to place which is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mirror until the light stopped working - hence 3 stars. Tried new batteries (3 different sets) to no avail. I&#x27;ve only had it 6 months (since November 2013). Would like a replacement.</li>
    <li> It is a little dim when the sun is up but I think it&#x27;s supposed to be that way, natural lighting. But yu can&#x27;t beat the fact that it&#x27;s cordless, thats the real winner!</li>
    <li> Really straightforward product. Works very nicely and fits in well with my bathroom decor. Just remember you need batteries to make it work.</li>
    <li> This mirror is so much better than another lighted mirror I bought several years ago.  The light is white and is stronger, and the mirror looks better.  The magnification is just right for seeing facial hairs, etc. you&#x27;d otherwise not see, yet you can still see your whole face up close.  The swivel gives enough resistance that it won&#x27;t fall out of your chosen angle, yet is still easy to move.  It&#x27;s perfect!  The tag says the batteries (you must provide) will last a year with regular use.  I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of the product as I just received it, but even the battery compartment impresses me-- batteries worked instantly, and no need for a screwdriver to get into it.  &amp;#34;Cordless&amp;#34; is the best feature of all.  So glad I bought it.</li>
