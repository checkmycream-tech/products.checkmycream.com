      <li>Great travel brush.</li>
      <li>The concept of folding tooth brush and holder is great but</li>
      <li>as good as others I have but could not find the&lt;br /&gt;other manufacturer in order to have them be a little&lt;br /&gt;stronger</li>
      <li>So handy.</li>
      <li>Not the greatest quality but does the trick and very compact.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten good use out of it as a light weight and portable tooth brush.</li>
      <li>These are so cute, handy and a very good soft bristle!  </li>
      <li>For gym or travel i haven&#x27;t found a better brush.</li>
      <li>better plastic, but ok</li>
      <li>Realistically these are sweet folding tooth brushes :)</li>
      <li>Sturdy, comfortable grip</li>
      <li>I got these for a bug out bag and they will only be used for that so peace of mind knowing I can have fresh breath during an emergency makes these great.</li>
      <li>The head of the toothbrush tucks into a recess in&lt;br /&gt;the handle to keep it clean.  </li>
      <li>Bristles are full, not flimsy and the handle is well made too.</li>
      <li>I like cool gadgets that do the job and these def work for any situation you are on the move and out of the house.</li>

      <li>Small, light weight, great for packing.</li>
      <li>pretty handy, but bristles are too soft</li>

      <li>The price was right and they arrived on time.</li>
      <li>They fit in the travel cases much better than the long brush in a toothbrush holder.</li>

      <li>exactly what you need to throw and go</li>
      <li>For a Business Dinner or Hot Date.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
      <li>We try to keep them ready to pick up and go and these toothbrushes are just right.  </li>
      <li>The Aim Premium Soft Travel Brushes with Super Grip 2 ct. is sturdy</li>
      <li>One works perfectly, the other is hard to get open once folded</li>
      <li>No big deal really, but if you buy those little tooth brush protectors (for normal tooth brush) they will do a better job at protecting the bristles from debris or germs during travle.</li>
      <li>I would rate the bristles this soft to medium which will do the trick.  </li>
      <li>Soft bristles are pictured, what was sent is firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;with soft bristles.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are pretty soft, so sometimes can be difficult to brush with, however it&#x27;s not meant to be a top of the line product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;toothbrushes -- definitely for an adult mouth.  </li>

<li> /&gt;toothbrushes -- definitely for an adult mouth.  </li>
<li> I like the fact that it folds into itself, but sometimes if you push it down too far it gets stuck.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone with arthritic or big hands, due to the catch being smallt to pry open.  </li>
<li> only downside is that the head isn&#x27;t 100% protected, as there is a little gap around it when folded up.</li>
<li> Its a little tricky to get open</li>
<li> This travel brush seems to be designed to stay closed.  </li>
<li> performed as expected; recently took it to china and vietnam and this was the least of my worries.</li>
<li> kinda of hard to get open</li>
<li> They instead spread out at odd angles when you attempt to fold the toothbrush to the travel position.</li>
<li> One small criticism: it&lt;br /&gt;can be hard to get a grip on the stem to open it.  </li>
<li> I use fingernail to get in the very small gap between&lt;br /&gt;the stem and the handle to pry a bit until I can grip with fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps that it can not easily accidentally open is a desired feature.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased July 2014.</li>
<li> It is awkward to open, and once opened for use, it lacks any detent(snap) to hold that open position.</li>
<li> Someone with arthritis&lt;br /&gt;may have trouble.  </li>
<li> If you are camping or traveling this takes up very little space and when folded is covering your brush head without the need for a toothbrush holder or cap.</li>
<li> The head on the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t lock out when you&#x27;re brushing your teeth, so it&#x27;s a bit hard to use.</li>
<li> They often pinch our fingers, and they are awkward to hold in your hand.  </li>
<li> We have used these brushes for a month, and both my husband and I are disappointed with the design of these brushes.  </li>

    <li> Excellent, Just what i need.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and a great space saver. If you are camping or traveling this takes up very little space and when folded is covering your brush head without the need for a toothbrush holder or cap. I would rate the bristles this soft to medium which will do the trick.  I got these for a bug out bag and they will only be used for that so peace of mind knowing I can have fresh breath during an emergency makes these great. Add Amazon Prime and they were an awesome deal.</li>
    <li> kinda of hard to get open</li>
    <li> I like the fold-up of this toothbrush. Bristles are full, not flimsy and the handle is well made too. Definitely not something that fell a part after my travels.</li>
    <li> These are so cute, handy and a very good soft bristle!  My husband and I each put one in our travel kits.  We try to keep them ready to pick up and go and these toothbrushes are just right.  They fit in the travel cases much better than the long brush in a toothbrush holder.</li>
    <li> Product is just as described.</li>
    <li> The head on the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t lock out when you&#x27;re brushing your teeth, so it&#x27;s a bit hard to use.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest quality but does the trick and very compact. Great travel brush.</li>
    <li> Solid travel toothbrush overall.  One works perfectly, the other is hard to get open once folded</li>

    <li> So handy. Works perfect for travel or camping. Sturdy, comfortable grip</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay open when brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> These are &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; toothbrushes, but in no way merit the name &amp;#34;Premium&amp;#34;.  The heads are soft as expected, but after about a week&#x27;s use, the bristles no longer tuck into the handle.  They instead spread out at odd angles when you attempt to fold the toothbrush to the travel position.</li>
    <li> The concept of folding tooth brush and holder is great but&lt;br /&gt;not as good as others I have but could not find the&lt;br /&gt;other manufacturer in order to have them be a little&lt;br /&gt;stronger better plastic, but ok</li>
    <li> exactly what you need to throw and go</li>
    <li> I keep these with me to brush before putting Invisalign back in. They work well and are convenient.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a travel tooth brush. The bristles are pretty soft, so sometimes can be difficult to brush with, however it&#x27;s not meant to be a top of the line product. I&#x27;ve gotten good use out of it as a light weight and portable tooth brush.</li>
    <li> We have used these brushes for a month, and both my husband and I are disappointed with the design of these brushes.  They often pinch our fingers, and they are awkward to hold in your hand.  I do not recommend them at all.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles are pictured, what was sent is firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time as these are too abrasive for me to brush with.</li>
    <li> For a Business Dinner or Hot Date.&lt;br /&gt;Keep your teeth maintained on the go.&lt;br /&gt;It folds up to protect the bristles.</li>
    <li> pretty handy, but bristles are too soft</li>
    <li> performed as expected; recently took it to china and vietnam and this was the least of my worries.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it folds into itself, but sometimes if you push it down too far it gets stuck.</li>
    <li> The Aim Premium Soft Travel Brushes with Super Grip 2 ct. is sturdy&lt;br /&gt;with soft bristles.  The head of the toothbrush tucks into a recess in&lt;br /&gt;the handle to keep it clean.  The head is on the larger size for modern&lt;br /&gt;toothbrushes -- definitely for an adult mouth.  One small criticism: it&lt;br /&gt;can be hard to get a grip on the stem to open it.  Someone with arthritis&lt;br /&gt;may have trouble.  I use fingernail to get in the very small gap between&lt;br /&gt;the stem and the handle to pry a bit until I can grip with fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps that it can not easily accidentally open is a desired feature.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased July 2014.</li>
    <li> This travel brush seems to be designed to stay closed.  It is awkward to open, and once opened for use, it lacks any detent(snap) to hold that open position. (it will likely fold during use)</li>
    <li> For gym or travel i haven&#x27;t found a better brush. I like cool gadgets that do the job and these def work for any situation you are on the move and out of the house.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a replacement to similar travel toothbrushes I have used for a couple of years. The price was right and they arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for traveling; well made.</li>
