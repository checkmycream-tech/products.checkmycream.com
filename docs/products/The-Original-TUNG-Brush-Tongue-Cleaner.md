      <li>Really good at scraping off that gunk on your tongue...  </li>

      <li>I have tried many tongue brush cleaners, this works amazing..</li>

      <li>Much better than any plastic scrapper.</li>
      <li>Love this brush, I&#x27;ve been using it with the companion gel</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I can also see the ick better in the Orabrush than the Tung</li>
      <li>I was always sure the scraper worked (and it did)</li>
      <li>I hope me being more gentle will still get the great results but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon is carrying it.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, this brush works better than any tongue cleaner out there.  </li>
      <li>The brush is the perfect size and shape to reach toward the back of the tongue without gagging.  </li>
      <li>do think the brush may have worked better if used in conjunction with the cleaning paste sold by the Tung company.</li>
      <li>Been using these tongue cleaners for over a year now and couldn&#x27;t be without it,i used to use a toothbrush to brush my tongue but found that these work a lot better.</li>
      <li>I know my tongue will be okay</li>
      <li>Works better than a toothbrush, but is not abrasive on the tongue.</li>
      <li>I hope they never stop making it! :)</li>
      <li>She said it worked well and was glad that I had bought more than one.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
      <li>and her tongue is finally very clean</li>
      <li>This tongue cleaner does the job quickly, easily and without prompting the gag reflex just like it says on the packaging.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t look here first.  </li>
      <li>give it three stars because despite its fantastic efficacy, it&#x27;s really easy to overdo it</li>
      <li>Honestly I didn&#x27;t think it would help that much</li>
      <li>and they work fantastic.</li>
      <li>I like this original version</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s super cheap</li>
      <li>so it helps me know whether or not I still need to clean my tongue.</li>
      <li>works great stainless steel by far</li>
      <li>When your selling a product for a different price maybe it would be a good idea to not have the cheaper price you got it for still on the package.</li>
      <li>the tung brush (and gel sold seperatly) keeps my tongue fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>This is awesome, it has STIFF bristles that actually clean your tongue, not like that of the \\&quot;other\\&quot; one that the bristles are so soft it doesn&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
      <li>Get Stainless steel tongue cleaner!!</li>
      <li>The brush is soft and does a great job completely cleaning with the first use.</li>
      <li>I was happy the bristles were strong and definitely felt like my tongue was getting a proper scrubbing!</li>
      <li>the bristles looked like they would do a better job, and the orabrush looked kind of like jelly or something that isn&#x27;t really firm.</li>
      <li>It caused her tongue to bleed and made it more sensitive.</li>
      <li>If you drink cream in your coffee, your tongue gets kind of white...</li>
      <li>but this is way more comfortable and also makes a visual difference.</li>
      <li>It is worth adding this to your hygiene kit.</li>
      <li>It gets the gunk off quite nicely, however, I thought my fresh breath would last the day, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Freaked out, I looked in the mirror and my tongue looked like a slab of meat fresh from the butcher&#x27;s lair.</li>
      <li>and it really leaves your tongue clean and your breath fresh</li>
      <li>The gel rinses off the tongue really well - better than normal toothpaste - and cleans well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d agree that this brush is probably more effective than a regular toothbrush  unless you&#x27;re using a very firm brush (which you probably shouldn&#x27;t be :).</li>
      <li>The bristles are very stiff and seem to be very effective at scrubbing the tongue.  </li>
      <li>The first day or two, your tongue will hurt.</li>
      <li>I decided to do my tongue first and went to town on my tongue.</li>
      <li>Your tongue will bleed at first, but you can&#x27;t even feel any pain.</li>
      <li>This tongue brush works very well to get plaque off your tongue!  </li>
      <li>Powerful bristles, works really well.</li>
      <li>Makes my life (and my mouth) much cleaner!</li>
      <li>My tongue has been rather sore and the soreness definitely becomes more pronounced when I eat or drink.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m being gentle!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve YET to find any other brush that is able to clean the tongue like this.  </li>
      <li>so it is important for me to have fresh breath when talking to the number of people I talk to on a daily basis.  </li>
      <li>I have definitely learned to be more gentle.</li>
      <li>This little product makes a huge difference in the way my mouth feels in the mornings upon awakeing, no bad breath,&lt;br /&gt;nice clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>This brush is very high quality.</li>
      <li>After trying this for a few days, I realized this thing works amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>but it really hurts.</li>
      <li>Tung bristles are harder and shorter than a toothbrush, but before I threw out my Orabrush I used it after I used this Tung brush and removed more ick.</li>
      <li>When I read reviews talking about how their tongue bled and how it hurt, I didn&#x27;t really take it to heart.</li>
      <li>by having this brush, you wont need any of the stainless steel tung cleaners etc.</li>
      <li>It bleeds so much</li>

    <li> I use this everyday to clean my tongue.  I have a second brush that I carry with me to work.  I&#x27;m in sales and I travel to different companies so it is important for me to have fresh breath when talking to the number of people I talk to on a daily basis.  Great job.</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace this after a few months, like you are suppose to do with tooth brushes, so went and grabbed on at walmart. Not nearly as good and left all that white stuff on my tongue. WIll be buying another one of these. They are great.</li>
    <li> This tongue brush works very well to get plaque off your tongue!  I love it and have used this brand and brush for years!  I hope they never stop making it! :)</li>
    <li> Gets all the gunk off your tongue. But beware if you brush too hard it could harm your tongue</li>
    <li> This item has become hard to find in my drugstore.  In my opinion, this brush works better than any tongue cleaner out there.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not on the shelves.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon is carrying it.  Makes my life (and my mouth) much cleaner!</li>
    <li> I work for a dentist and we had a debate on tongue scrapers vs. tongue brushes.The dentist recommended a tongue brush over the scraper. I&#x27;ve used a tongue scraper for years and it became a necessity in my lengthy morning brushing routine. I was always sure the scraper worked (and it did) because of all the gunk that came off my tongue. Anyone who has used one knows what I&#x27;m talking about. But the scraper only gets the superficial tongue ickies. The brush gets in the grooves and crevices, and reaches further back before I feel a gag reflex coming about. What a huge difference! Oh my goodness. Not only did my tongue feel neutralized but when you do it at night before bed (assuming you have decent brushing habits) morning breath was not a thing. I have a nightguard I wear at night and anyone who wears any sort of nightguard, snore appliance or retainer knows how much they add on to gross morning funk. Even with my nightguard in, the tung brush has kept my mouth feeling good, even in the morning. Honestly I didn&#x27;t think it would help that much but it has. I have not tried the Tung Gel but I dip the brush in Listerine Zero to wet it, and then use my regular toothpaste, and it does the job just fine. In the beginning I used my tongue scraper afterwards, but nothing came off so I have since tossed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE WARNING: The first day or two, your tongue will hurt. The first time I used it, my tastebuds bled a little bit and my tongue felt sensitive. The next morning when I used it, my tastebuds bled again and my tongue hurt quite badly throughout the day- to the point where I almost ditched the brush. But I read the packaging and it does warn of both the bleeding and the soreness during the first few uses. On day 3 there was no bleeding and no soreness whatsoever, and there hasn&#x27;t been since. So just brave through it and you&#x27;ll be glad you did :)</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  Life changing!!!</li>
    <li> Works well.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> This little product makes a huge difference in the way my mouth feels in the mornings upon awakeing, no bad breath,&lt;br /&gt;nice clean feeling.  It just takes a little effort to add this to your brushing routine, but no big deal, after a couple of weeks it has become a must after brushing.  If I fail to use it, I can really tell the difference.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> Personally, I think the Orabrush tongue cleaner works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Tung bristles are harder and shorter than a toothbrush, but before I threw out my Orabrush I used it after I used this Tung brush and removed more ick. Needless to say, I did not throw away my Orabrush. I can also see the ick better in the Orabrush than the Tung so it helps me know whether or not I still need to clean my tongue. I keep both tongue cleaners for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the brush may have worked better if used in conjunction with the cleaning paste sold by the Tung company. I did not use the paste, just the brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent tongue cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;This &#x27;tongue brush&#x27; is great because it cleans without scraping (scraping makes the tongue bleed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some tooth power on it (like Ipsab tooth powder), and I brush firmly, in a back &amp; forth motion, all the way from the back of the tongue, to the front.  Works very well, to remove the plaque coating from the tongue.</li>
    <li> The best one out there</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with my tongue for a long time.  My taste buds and papillae tend to grow longer than normal, allowing bacteria to hide and grow, and causing bad breath.  Normal toothbrushes are inadequate to properly clean my tongue, as they cannot reach as far back as I need.  Regular tongue scrapers also do not seem to do much for me.  So, when I first saw the Tung Brush and Tung Gel here on Amazon, I was a bit skeptical.  But not for long!  After trying this for a few days, I realized this thing works amazingly well.  The brush is the perfect size and shape to reach toward the back of the tongue without gagging.  The gel rinses off the tongue really well - better than normal toothpaste - and cleans well.  After a couple of weeks using the brush and gel, my tongue was looking better than ever, and my breath seemed fresher and cleaner (at least according to my wife and children).  Added to normal tooth brushing and flossing, it will go a long way to improving oral health - that has been my case for sure.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works better than any other tongue brush!!</li>
    <li> Order two, one for the house and one to keep with you at all times.  My tongue was a little tender after the first couple of uses and maybe I was brushing too hard, but I don&#x27;t have a white tongue anymore either.</li>
    <li> Works.  What else can I say?</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It cleans your tongue so well, and improves your breath. Your tongue will bleed at first, but you can&#x27;t even feel any pain. No more gunk on my tongue!</li>
    <li> I just ordered 3 more to one in each bath room. exceptionally good and practical in cleaning the tung. by having this brush, you wont need any of the stainless steel tung cleaners etc. The quality looks very good.The difference between this brush and the tung cleaners is, this realy cleans the tung and remove the things on the tung at the same time.</li>
    <li> This is a really good design!  The &amp;#34;brush/head&amp;#34; is apx. 1&amp;#34; in diameter &amp; 3/8&amp;#34; thick; therefore, it takes up less room in the mouth.  The bristles are very short &amp; tight together.  The main thing is I found it to be less &amp;#34;gag&amp;#34; prone, especially after using it a few times.  Compared w/a regular toothbrush, this is wider &amp; flatter &amp; is so much easier to use.</li>
    <li> It cleans the tongue easier than a toothbrush, It does not hurt. It is worth adding this to your hygiene kit.</li>
    <li> Been using these tongue cleaners for over a year now and couldn&#x27;t be without it,i used to use a toothbrush to brush my tongue but found that these work a lot better.</li>
    <li> I had tried tongue scrapers, in addition to my Waterpik and Sonicare, but was stilling dealing with some funky breathe. My dentist suggested one of these little guys and the improvement is noticeable.</li>
    <li> This brush would be great if it had softer bristles. It reaches the back of my tongue but it really hurts. I used it twice and have not touched  it since because I&#x27;m scared. I swear that every time I look at it, my tongue hurts.</li>
    <li> i loved this and i use it all the time. even with regular toothpaste</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush for your tongue... does its job lol</li>
    <li> Really good at scraping off that gunk on your tongue...  Not rough feeling at all.</li>
    <li> Great delivery.  Good idea, instead of using the toothbrush as a tongue cleaner this is best.</li>
    <li> Not as great as I thought it would be,. Get Stainless steel tongue cleaner!! works great stainless steel by far</li>
    <li> I love this product. I dip it in hydrogen peroxide or mouthwash for 5 minutes then use it. Your tongue is left nice in pink and have a less offensive morning breath in the morning after using it before going to bed at night.  The bristles are a little tougher then regular toothbrush and the round shape of the head allows for cleaning the tongue without gagging too much. Yes, you may still gag.</li>
    <li> I bought the  item for my daughter.  She had been looking for this item and being that we live in a small town we don&#x27;t always have a place that sells some of the things we want.  She was happy to get it and it was the brand that she wanted.  She had had this item before and really liked it.  She said it worked well and was glad that I had bought more than one.</li>
    <li> I have tried four different other types of tongue cleaners and I was never quite satisfied because they either took too long to use or kept me gagging so much it was hard to finish. This tongue cleaner does the job quickly, easily and without prompting the gag reflex just like it says on the packaging. I would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Prefer the metal tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> It works great. It feels like a stiff flat gentle cleaning brush and not a scraper. I like this original version and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I ahve looked all over to replace the one ive had way too long.  I love and will buy again!</li>
    <li> it gets the nasty out and the tongue too... made my tongue bleed pretty easily. May be different for you.</li>
    <li> the tung brush (and gel sold seperatly) keeps my tongue fresh and clean.  i highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> When I read reviews talking about how their tongue bled and how it hurt, I didn&#x27;t really take it to heart. I thought if it happened it would be hardly anything, but it is the third day and my tongue is so sore! It bleeds so much and I&#x27;m being gentle! I wanted the tung brush over orabrush cause the bristles looked like they would do a better job, and the orabrush looked kind of like jelly or something that isn&#x27;t really firm. I definitely regret that decision.</li>
    <li> I have a stainless steel tongue cleaner as well but I just don&#x27;t like it as much as a brush.  The Tung brush is better than a toothbrush because the bristles are short and stiff, and the surface is wide.  Love it!  you can cause trauma if you apply the brush too vigorously but otherwise this brush is effective and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was buying the TUNG Gel cleaner and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  The bristles are very stiff and seem to be very effective at scrubbing the tongue.  I&#x27;d agree that this brush is probably more effective than a regular toothbrush  unless you&#x27;re using a very firm brush (which you probably shouldn&#x27;t be :).</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without this....getting another one for travel.  Great for keeping tongue clean and free of germs.  If you drink cream in your coffee, your tongue gets kind of white...this cleans it back to pink!  Doesn&#x27;t hurt either, like those steel scrapers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to really say about this product.  I ordered one from Amazon because the one I had before (same brand and model) was several years old and still doing a fine job at tongue cleaning (don&#x27;t worry, it wasn&#x27;t grody or anything).  I just felt that after several years, it was sensible to replace it with a brand new one (it&#x27;s super cheap anyway so it&#x27;s not hurting my wallet any).  Really don&#x27;t have any complaints about this brush.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter, it works&lt;br /&gt;great and her tongue is finally very clean&lt;br /&gt;that to this product.</li>
    <li> Yes this product scrubs and cleans your tongue, sometimes it chafes your tongue and causes it to bleed. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using every day.</li>
    <li> Works better than a toothbrush, but is not abrasive on the tongue. Easy to use. Takes little time or effort.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to like anything that makes me gag, but this - I do like. It is much better than tongue scrapers; the bristles get down into what a tongue scraper skims over. And unlike a tooth brush, the bristles are short, and can get back further with this before feeling the gag reflex. I am happy about this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/17/14: Changed from 4 stars to 5. This brush is very high quality.</li>
    <li> This tung brush really does work but the bristles are so hard it will make spots on your tongue bleed. Also for the price you can get this brush for less then two bucks at the dollar store or at a big lots. When I had received this in the mail it has a price sticker on it for I believe $1.49. When your selling a product for a different price maybe it would be a good idea to not have the cheaper price you got it for still on the package.</li>
    <li> Powerful bristles, works really well. Not sure what more to say, def worth buying this and using instead of a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I am pretty normal in dental hygiene (brush twice a day nearly every day, floss almost daily) and I love having a tongue brush like this. I have had a tongue scraper but this is way more comfortable and also makes a visual difference.</li>
    <li> It works. Cleans my tongue and saves wear &amp; tear on my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have tried many tongue brush cleaners, this works amazing..</li>
    <li> This is the best tongue cleaner brush on the market.  When you combine this with Dr. Wieders Tung Cleaner Gel, you don&#x27;t have to worry about bad breath!</li>
    <li> I got this because of the coating and fowl odour on my tongue.  It gets the gunk off quite nicely, however, I thought my fresh breath would last the day, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I still like it though, it does help a little.</li>
    <li> This thing will tear your tongue UP! I suppose this is partially my fault because I usually brush my tongue quite vigorously since I&#x27;d brush it with my regular toothbrush. I got this today in the mail and immediately went to brush my teeth. I decided to do my tongue first and went to town on my tongue. I was happy the bristles were strong and definitely felt like my tongue was getting a proper scrubbing! I felt a lot of saliva building up, so I spit in the sink. BLOOD AND SALIVA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freaked out, I looked in the mirror and my tongue looked like a slab of meat fresh from the butcher&#x27;s lair. I scrubbed everywhere a little too vigorously and as a result got bleeding spots all over my tongue. It was not pretty but I swished some peroxide in my mouth and the bleeding stopped. My tongue has been rather sore and the soreness definitely becomes more pronounced when I eat or drink. I know my tongue will be okay so I&#x27;m not calling this a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely works! After my tongue stopped looking like a victim of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I was pleasantly surprised to see it was PANK. Not pink, PANK~ The Tung Brush sent the plaque on my tongue an immediate eviction notice and I definitely do appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it three stars because despite its fantastic efficacy, it&#x27;s really easy to overdo it and when you overdo it, you look like you frenched a vampire. I have definitely learned to be more gentle. I hope me being more gentle will still get the great results but either way, I&#x27;ll find a good balance. I&#x27;m going to give my tongue a couple of days to heal before I go again.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old uses it. It caused her tongue to bleed and made it more sensitive. Only used it for a few days.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after running out of the BreathRx tongue cleaning system.  (Really liked everything about the BreathRx system, but just wanted to try something else and the reviews on this product were really good.)  After trying the Tung brush and gel several times, I discontinued using it because it made me gag terribly despite how often I tried to use it and how I tried to be careful during use. (I even tried keeping the tongue brush closer to the front of my mouth but that defeats the purpose because you need to get the icky stuff :) at the back of the tongue.)  I simply do not prefer this product or the Tung gel that goes with it and will go back to the BreathRx system.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, I&#x27;ve been using it with the companion gel and it really leaves your tongue clean and your breath fresh, I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this type of tongue brush cleaner in drug and other stores with no luck. I bought several online and they work fantastic. Much better than any plastic scrapper. The brush is soft and does a great job completely cleaning with the first use.</li>
    <li> works!&lt;br /&gt;I heard they changed the design to make the brittles shorter, i guess to eliminate gaging when brushing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it helps immensely to control my bad breath, which comes from an always rough stomach and GERD.  It&#x27;s a must for me.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to tongue brush. It used to be sold in major pharmacy chains but sadly I can&#x27;t find it there anymore. I tried going back to tongue scrapers and other tongue brushes while I waited for my order but it just led to frustration. Nothing works the way this tongue brush does. I know that some people like to use it in combination with tongue scrapers but I find that the scraper adds nothing. I have to caution though that if you are looking for something soft and gentle this is not the brush for you. It is somewhat coarse and intense; it gets the job done perfectly because of that but can lead to some scraping and probably isn&#x27;t the best for children.</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t look here first.  My mom got me a tongue brush YEARS ago and it was this one.  I moved and could never find it.  This is awesome, it has STIFF bristles that actually clean your tongue, not like that of the \\&quot;other\\&quot; one that the bristles are so soft it doesn&#x27;t do anything.  YES if you do brush to hard your tongue will bleed but I&#x27;ve YET to find any other brush that is able to clean the tongue like this.  I wish the shape was alittle bit different in the sense that it was more triangle than circular because of how our tongues are shaped... but overall this is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying 10 of these so I have them on hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nigel</li>
