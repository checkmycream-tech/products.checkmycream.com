<li> Putting this stuff on a wiggly toddler is a messy business.</li>

<li> No cfc &#x27;s and the kids don&#x27;t mind the spray because it doesn&#x27;t feel cold.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s non-nano and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of nasty stuff.  </li>

    <li> Like this a lot.  Easy on, given that it&#x27;s a spray, but high SPF and safe ingredients (checked on EWG site).  Also nice to have the double cap to keep other things in the beach bag from getting lotion on them.  Pleasant neutral smell.</li>
    <li> After recommendations and reading reviews, we tried this sun lotion spray and have been very happy. If gives great coverage without the aerosol type spray cans. You do have to run it in but it sprays wife and covers quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;We also purchased the lotion which we love but did not like the face stick. It was way too chalky and hard to apply. The lotion and spray lotion are always in our pool and beach bags!</li>
    <li> Very dry to the touch and didn&#x27;t rub in easily. Which is fine for legs and arms but wasn&#x27;t pleasant for the face. Also, I was expecting this to be easy to apply and spray on as a mist but it comes out very white and in clumps.</li>
    <li> Love the way this feels. No cfc &#x27;s and the kids don&#x27;t mind the spray because it doesn&#x27;t feel cold. Love the mineral based sunscreens and kids have avoided sunburn so far, I also use it on my face with no greasy feel.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that works on our kids.  They are allergic to most Sunscreens out there, so this is the best that they get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent 1 week in Disneyland (~90 Degree heat each day) and we applied this every 4-6 hours.  Not even a burn, and it goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will continue to purchase this, as long as the children need it.</li>
    <li> My favorite sunblock. We use for the whole family.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s white but non greasy which is great</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen for my little one.  It is so easy to apply. The smell is pleasant.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and keeps my son protected from the sun. It&#x27;s easy to put on. My only complaint is I have to wash my hands twice after applying it in order to get the gummy feel off my palms. But I guess that means it will stay on my son really well and won&#x27;t rub or sweat off easily.</li>
    <li> As a sunscreen it works great but the overspray is very difficult to get off. My wife sprayed the kids on our deck, getting overspray on the deck, railing and table. You have to scrub this stuff off and even then it still leaves a light stain. We threw this spray away and bought the same brand of sunscreen in a squeeze bottle.</li>
    <li> one bottle only, my order should come with two.  I order a spray, the bottle is spray but the sunblock is cream!  Buyer be aware.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen!  It&#x27;s one of the highest rated sunscreens, and is much safer than most brands.  I use it for myself and my kids.</li>
    <li> I did a LOT of research before buying a sunscreen for my toddler. I had bad experiences with other mineral sunscreens which were too difficult to rub in. This one is rated a 3 by the EWG.  I think one of the things that brings the rating down is the fact that it&#x27;s a spray.  I just spray this into my hands and then rub it on him. It rubs in really well and isn&#x27;t too greasy.  It also doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all.  I put it on him before I drop him off at daycare every day.  He spends a pretty good amount of time outside, but hasn&#x27;t gotten burned.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Goes on nice and really protects for a long time! Even with hours of water play</li>
    <li> Bought it to use it on adult skin. Has a mild fragrance (almost like freshly cut plants or flowers, not overpowering) and not the typical sunscreen scent. Pleasant to apply, non sticky and leaves no white cast over skin. No skin breakouts or problems. Love the double cap closure. Easy to throw it in the luggage.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a clear spray that I wouldn&#x27;t have to spread with my hand. Putting this stuff on a wiggly toddler is a messy business. It&#x27;s non greasy, light and pleasant smelling. Works fine but messy to apply on a small child.</li>
    <li> Kids still burn sometimes. Have to reapply a lot!</li>
    <li> This works great for my 2 year old!  I love that it&#x27;s mineral based so safer for my child than those filled with chemicals.  It sprays nicely and rubs in quickly.  Much quicker than trying to spread around thick sunscreen on a wiggly 2 year old!</li>
    <li> We LOVE this sunscreen.  My whole family uses it.  It&#x27;s a non-aerosol spray that&#x27;s easy to spread evenly.  It&#x27;s non-nano and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of nasty stuff.  It prevents burns and doesn&#x27;t feel super oily.  It has a pleasant, non-perfumey smell, too.</li>
