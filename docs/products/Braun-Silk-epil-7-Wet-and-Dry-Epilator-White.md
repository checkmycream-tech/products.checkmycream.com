<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is not good , like it said</li>
    <li> This product works well. I&#x27;m still getting used to it though. I still find hairs growing at different intervals.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Highly recommend. I don&#x27;t want to use anything else ever again.</li>
    <li> Very surprised how thoroughly &amp; painlessly this removes the unwanted hair on face &amp; legs! Leaves them smooth &amp; silky soft. Wayyy better than the $20 dollar one I got from a magazine.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun epilators for years to remove facial hair, primarily over my lip. My last epilator was more than 10 years old and the motor was beginning to sound strained. Also I wanted one that could be cordless for traveling internationally, so I bought this new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sensational. I have to admit that I use it not as advised. None of the attachments work for me on my face so I just take the whole attachment part off and use it without one. I&#x27;m sure Braun would be horrified but I used my old one this way too and it works fine. This new epilator is fast, much less painful, and somehow is getting the hair out deeper from the root because it is growing back slower.  I am really happy with it. I can&#x27;t speak to its use on other body parts but would assume it would work good there too. Certainly it was worth the money for me.</li>
    <li> used for 10 times, then the blades become blunt</li>
    <li> really does take cate of the stubborn short hairs. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> The best epilator I ever had!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can expect every epilation to be painful at first, but this thing makes it fast and simple.</li>
    <li> Forget razors!! This is amazing! Only thing is that it runs out of charge fast and can&#x27;t use it when it&#x27;s charging. Lasts about 30 minutes if it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> This gadget is AMAZING! I purchased an &amp;#34;Epilady&amp;#34; eight years ago and have used it ever since, tolerating a high level of pain for the end results. Little did i know how far technology has progressed in the epilator world since then. After so much use, it recently broke down, propelling me to do research for a new one. I found this one by BRAUN and after using it for the first time i feel like i traded in my Honda for a Bentley! I epilated my entire body in under an hour!! And on a scale from 1-10, discomfort was a 1 on non-sentitive areas and a 5 on very sensitive areas. I noticed the blades on this device are very thin and do not pinch the skin, like my previous one. And yes, it does pull from the root and did not seem to break the hairs at all. The process is a piece of cake and the device is super easy to clean!! I&#x27;m glad i spent the extra money. Btw, i have not tried it wet yet since my hairs are easier to see when dry. Doubt i&#x27;ll be using it in the shower, unless i&#x27;m in a rush one day!</li>
    <li> I love this epilator.  I have been using my old epilator for about 20 years.  I  bought another brand and liked it, but it only alsted about 6 months before it quit.  This one gets the hairs out of my leg quickly and the light is in a position and bright enough to actually make a difference.  I also love being using the trimmer in the shower.  I think it said not to use the trimmer or shaver in the shower, but I am ignoring that and use it in there anyway.</li>
    <li> I had never even heard of an epilator before I bought this 4 days ago but I must say it really does work. I went crazy and did my legs, arms, stomach, and even my armpits and they&#x27;re still super smooth.  I do have to warn you guys this is the most pain I have ever felt in my life. I&#x27;ve never been tattooed but I imagine it feels just like epilating. I bought the Braun 7681 because I was new to this and wanted to make sure it worked and it does, but you can buy a much cheaper Braun that works just the same. I would go with the Braun 7181 it doesn&#x27;t include all the accessories that the 7681 has but in my opinion they&#x27;re not really all that helpful and the 7181 is prettier and pink haha. Ohhhh and if you&#x27;re hoping to do your bikini area with this good luck I tried but it&#x27;s way too painful and I think I have a pretty good pain tolerance</li>
    <li> It could have been a great experience... Except my sister ordered Emoji epilator and I tried it. This Braun won for me because of the light and ability to switch the heads to make it work for any area of the body. Emoji is wider, so it&#x27;s harder to maneuver. It also doesn&#x27;t have a light feature that helps things out if you don&#x27;t want to keep shifting positions while sitting in front of a lamp. Over all, if you need to epilate large and flat areas: legs, back etc. Emoji is the best thing you can find. If you are willing to suffer more pain and make epilator your go to solution to most hair removal problems - you will have to stick to Braun. It&#x27;s good - it just doesn&#x27;t match up in speed and painlesness to technique that Emoji implemented</li>
    <li> Really REALLY hurts and it irritated my skin and made it bumpy and even took a layer of my skin off. :[ I ended up having to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Strong, fast and it holds the charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it in the shower, only on dry skin and it performs excellently.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the long cable on the rare occasions that the charge is dead when I use it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the little things...</li>
    <li> I have been using at the epilatirs for 20 years usually Emjoi.  However, I decided to switch for some reason when my last one broke and bought this Braun. I would have to say after 20 years of epilating this is the least painful one I have used and the cleanest single pass I&#x27;ve ever had.  For the first time ever I was able to epilate areas I have never been able to epilate due to the level of pain but this Braun item has allowed me to do so which I am going to be forever grateful. I highly recommend spending the extra money for this high quality product. five stars. anybody reading this should definitely buy this!!!</li>
    <li> I dont use it personally. Got as a gift for a friend and they are loving it. Never had any problem.</li>
    <li> It was a present and my GF was happy. I decided to by two more for my mother and sis. Veryone was happy</li>
    <li> The Braun SE7661 Silk-epil 7 worked as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;There are different attachments for removing hair on different body locations which give a lot of flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this device to others.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle doing the epilator part of it. I am too week for the pain!, but I used the shaver attachment. It was amazing. I actually decided to buy a dedicated electric shaver figuring that it had to be better than a shaver attachment on an epilator since it was dedicated and designed to be a shaver, but that one was not as good as this. So i feel like this product is great since if gives you all the options and if you cannot handle the epilator pain like me then you get a good electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I use this for the chest, shoulders, back and the outlying areas of the armpits.  I manscaped with a Wahl trimmer prior to first use, bringing everything down to at most 1/4&amp;#34;.  I must say, even though there is a significant fear factor and intensity not unlike pain involved, this is true of any epilator and this model is much more productive than the Emjoi I purchased and threw out last year.  (That is, more good plucks and less skin ripping for the same amount of pain.)  I was able to get from 1&amp;#34; below the waistline all the way up to my neck done in one charge.  The nicest thing about such a productive tweezing drum is that there were no ingrown hairs at the waistline area.  I have very sensitive skin and this has always been why had so rarely shaved my chest.  One week later and I touched up around the outer regions of the armpits, back, shoulders and another pass over new growth of the chest.  While this worked on the peach fuzz missed by the previous use, the new growth of darker hairs was less inclined to pluck and broke off.  I ended up shaving this for a better appearance, but it didn&#x27;t amount to much stubble.  I would recommend letting new growth grow to about 1/8&amp;#34; before going over it again.  Other than that, I can see this machine as a real way to keep a stubble-free beach body for weeks at a time!  On a side note, the color of the device is a sparkly white, but not irridescent or overtly feminine.  They really should market the same model in a more masculine aesthetic, though.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington before, but Braun is so much better and a lot less pain with epilation. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to ones, who have dense  hair :) Ii works fine and lasts more than an hour, when its fully charged</li>
    <li> Wish I would have started epilating sooner.  Besides for using one when they first came out over 20 years ago and gave up, I have not used an epilator.  I was afraid it would be painful and I would have paid the $$$ for it to just sit around.  But I did what they said in the reviews-- shaved first (with the direction of hair growth), exfoliated with a sugar/salt scrub and used corn starch  after a hot shower and for the first week just keep doing a little at a time.  Did not really hurt on my legs, and arm pits were the most sensitive.  I am using it about 2 months and love it.  Still a little sensitive on the underarms but not bad.  I used to have to shave daily with the hair growth if I was going out in public in shorts/ skirt and my hair always grew back course black in less than a day.  Now the hair is thin, I epilate about once a week because stray hairs appear but unless you really inspect the legs you don&#x27;t see them.  It is wonderful.  I read many reviews and picked the Braun because they said it was faster than most and I figured if it was going to be painful I wanted it to be quick.  Now that I have used the epilator and the hair growth is not as fast , A single full charge lasts for me that can I complete both legs, armpits, bikini area.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.I can see it is picking very short hair too.I don&#x27;t think i can stay without epillator and this one fulfill my purpose. But still its little bit stronger for lips area as it took my skin too but i didnot use its attachment . Messager really work well.Overall good product.I used more than 1 year</li>
    <li> This is my first use and purchase of an epilator, so I&#x27;m by no means an expert, but my limited experience with this device has been good. I primarily wanted to try an epilator on my underarms. I hate shaving there every couple of days during the summer and I&#x27;ve read that it can be bad for your body to be constantly irritated/absorbing the chemicals in deodorants. I tried the epilator first on my legs, just to see what the pain experience would be like. For me, the legs are a no-go. I only did my calves and while the pain wasn&#x27;t too bad, it took a LONG time and I had a red, bumpy rash there for the rest of the night. I do have sensitive skin and my leg hair is thin and pretty light, so I just don&#x27;t feel willing to commit to using this product on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for my underarms, it was a whole different story! Yes, it hurts, I&#x27;m not going to lie...but the results so awesome! I have epilated twice now, about 10 days apart. The first time was difficult, it hurt and it was hard to find the right angles and find the method that worked best for me. The second time took me only about 5 min. and, while the pain was still there, was more bearable. The results are great! My pits have never looked so smooth and razor burn free! I have not had any problems with ingrown hairs, but I have used an exfoliating scrub 2-3 times in between epilating sessions. I have also found that applying baby powder to the skin first allows for the machine to glide more smoothly over the area. I also recommend using aloe vera immediately after...it stings quite a bit, but it will prevent infection and helps keep the skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give this product the full 5 stars, because I think the attachments are a bit of a joke. I have been using the one specifically for underarms/bikini line and it is just a little plastic head that goes over the normal epilator head. I am afraid to use the regular one for these areas as it is much larger and might catch my skin, but only the regular head has the massager built in. The speeds, light, and charging all worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product for some uses as long as you can tolerate a little pain!</li>
    <li> The charging cable doesn&#x27;t fit the device, falls out on a flat surface - you have to tape the charging cable to the device to keep it connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is weak, and is ineffective at pulling hair out. It misses 85% of hair per pass, but if you move it more than 5mm per second, fails to remove any hair at all. Doing 2 square inches takes roughly 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet, dry, baby powder, epilation treatment - doesn&#x27;t matter, performance is horrible. The plastic head with grooves is the fastest, but only by a slight margin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer head teeth are too large, and tend to cut slices out of you even if you&#x27;re careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of Braun engineering, but this looks like it was designed by Play-Skool.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator as my previous one died after more than 6 years. The head is very fast and the hair removal very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s also more comfortable than my previous one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that the head is not very wide</li>
    <li> Stupid me paid $100.00 for this and it is no better than the one i have thats like 5 years old.  Being cordless and waterproof is a plus but the battery does not hold a long charge and unless your hair is  somewhat long you&#x27;re better off shaving with a razor!!&lt;br /&gt;Save your money</li>
    <li> It does hurt a little the first couple of times but then it&#x27;s really not bad.  I love not having to shave everyday and I can already notice the hair on my legs coming in lighter.</li>
    <li> Came just as described. Shipped quicker than expected and box was unopened and contained all items.  Happy with the seller. Product itself works well but hurts more than expected.</li>
    <li> I like it it is what i expected exactly, i loved all the accessory and used them except for the shaving head and i think i will not use it&lt;br /&gt;and i have some point that should be known at first it had adaptor from 110 to 220 hz&lt;br /&gt;and secondly you can&#x27;t use it when it plugged in electricity&lt;br /&gt;that is for now .</li>
    <li> battery dies very fast, and i cannot run it while pluging it to AC power!! that is just another limitation&lt;br /&gt;besides the battery and power, it is excellent</li>
    <li> Does not do as said and the close up items that came with it did not fit.  For the amount of money spent I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The Braun Epilator works amazingly well.  Is it painful? Yes, but it becomes less and less painful with each additional use (in the same area).  Make sure you read the instructions, i.e. hair is trimmed to appropriate length and be sure to pull your skin tight - it makes a big difference.  And I had better results using the epilator dry versus wet.  I haven&#x27;t seen results that last anywhere near 4 weeks, but maybe that will happen after continued repeated use.  But I&#x27;m definitely using an epilator a lot less frequently than I was using a razor.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and actually does what it says! I have a problem with hair on my chin and neck and it is thick and coarse so shaving really damages my skin. I tried laser treatments and was so dissappointed in the result. Luckily I used a groupon but I was still out $108 dollars and I didn&#x27;t even finish the treatments because I was at the point of why bother. So, I started researched other ways to remove unwanted hair and I came across this product. After reading many reviews I choose the Braun SE7681 and I love it! Yep it hurts but after the first time you know what to expect. Ice the area before use and that really deadens the pain. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this prodcut. It comes with so many extras as well! Buy it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, she had been interested in trying out an epilator.  Turns out that wet, or dry, the epilator is just a bit more painful that we&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> I got this to tweezers the hair on my upper cheeks.  It usually leaves a little blood behind.  It takes some courage to use this thing on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator. I had an Emjoi Emagine previously. It was just ok, it did the job for a while but it stopped working after a year. Hope this one lasts a lot longer than that. I bought the warranty just to be sure. This Braun one gets more hair out, is quieter, works wet or dry which is great, and I love that it&#x27;s cordless and chargeable. Epilating is painful for sure but the smooth skin and infrequent maintenance is worth it. This particular one is my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> I bit the bullet and chose the Braun Silk-Epil 7681 Wet and Dry because it&#x27;s designed to be used in the bath and shower. As I love my baths, I mistakenly thought AHA! soaking in the bath will loosen up my leg hair follicles and therefore make the hair removal process tolerable. Uh, wrong unfortunately. For some reason, removing the hair on my upper lip is not a problem, and neither is removing strays from between my eyebrows. If you don&#x27;t have a problem with hair removal pain then I recommend this model. It is light, charges quickly, holds a long charge, has a light, multiple heads, can be clean under running water and used wet and dry. However, if you are like me in the hair removal pain department this probably is not the best option.</li>
    <li> I have the [[ASIN:B004QI8UJK Braun SE 5280 Silk Epil 5 Epilator With Ice Glove, Pink]], and though the 7681 Wet and Dry Epilator has more stuff and is faster, I found that I much prefer the 5280. I have very fine hair on my legs, and the 7681 while it goes faster than the 5280, does not pick up the hairs on my legs near as well as the 5280. While the attachments, like for the face is a nice touch, I can go get waxed, or use an at home product like [[ASIN:B0058AGBYG Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo 1 Kit]] (which I have used and liked) that actually works better than the epilator. The razor does work well on the 7681, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I just don&#x27;t see this as a worthy upgrade, especially for the cost.</li>
    <li> Very effective, very impressive. I&#x27;ve noticed that the more comfortable I become with the device, the epilator removes the hair more efficiently. The angle at which you hold the device is key in removing the hair completely from the follicle. I have coarse hair and I&#x27;ve only used it for my underarm once and on my legs twice at this point. But the hair has grown back finer. Seriously, amazing!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think it grabs the short hairs very well and instead of pulling from roots, it sometimes just snips it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product. Good quality and the battery lasts for a while. I normally wax but I hate the time consuming nature of waxing. This comes in handy.</li>
    <li> It is true about removing really tiny hair!! however when hair is wet it quite difficult to remove, but I do like it it does what it has to</li>
    <li> I bought this product on in June 2014 and it stopped working in November 2014! The instrument gets charged, but doesn&#x27;t rotate rendering it useless. I feel I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Sure, it hurts, but it works! I have had a &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; with thick,dark hair all my life. I usually have to shave at least once a day in the summer, and I go every other day in the winter. I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for about a month now, and I am very satisfied with the results. The first time you use it will be the worst, but it gets better, because you&#x27;ve gotten out most if the hair the first time. Then you just keep maintaining, and it all works out!</li>
    <li> I did quite a bit of research before committing to this epilator. It&#x27;s one of the more expensive options, but it really is worth the money when you consider quality and all the accompanying accessories. It&#x27;s efficient, ergonomic, and not too loud. I love that it comes with so many different caps for the epilator top AND it comes with a shaver top. So on days where I don&#x27;t have time to epilate (because I&#x27;m not use to the pain it&#x27;s a bit of a process for me) I can still shave, and not have to buy a separate electric shaver. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Best epilator I have used!</li>
    <li> I loved it.. Thank you for the excellent quality of the product I want to buy from you again</li>
    <li> I really like it, I tried the no no before this and I am blond and it wasn&#x27;t working this removes the hair and doesn&#x27;t come back for quite awhile much better, there is somewhat of a sting but doesn&#x27;t   last;when I get more used to it that should leave.</li>
    <li> this product is so beautiful and precise , it dose remove very fine hair and the associated heads helps a lot in the body sensitive area ,</li>
    <li> Wanted one for several years, but couldn&#x27;t find a highly rated model until this one.  It is a very good product, works as it is supposed to.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Works very well and is easy and painless.  I am so glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. AND YES, it hurts like a @#$%^. Just sayin&#x27; .&lt;br /&gt;It does get easier with time. Use it in a hot shower (pores open) and don&#x27;t bother buying the expensive lidocaine cream, its crap/  I only use it for my legs and they are looking better and better everyday :)</li>
    <li> a little expensive but good</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly. As described</li>
    <li> I researched lots of epilators, this one got great reviews for different sized heads of multiple areas. So, lets start with my legs. They have never been waxed before so it hurt like a mother, was almost in tears and sweating like a damn pig. Moving on to areas that have been waxed, lasered, electrolysized...those areas weren&#x27;t that bad relatively speaking. The bikini area is a bit tricky, still haven&#x27;t quite mastered that one yet but I&#x27;ll keep trying, it was more painful in areas at are sensitive when I get waxed. I did a small area on my abdomen, it was a breeze. The underarms were tricky because of the contortionistic position you&#x27;re in trying to hold skin tight with one hand while epilating with the other. It hurt but was bearable, not like my legs. The electric razor portion is good too. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the water or with shaving cream for smoother gliding so I can&#x27;t comment on that. Clean up was simple.</li>
    <li> This thing sucks. It works, sure, if you can tolerate it. It hurts so much that I rather cut the skin that has the hair I want to remove off, with a rusty razor, than continue to use this machine.</li>
    <li> i have used this product about a handful of times now, and i&#x27;ve never used an epilator before. i was scared at first but am already used to the feeling and its use.  the first time was painful since my underarm hair was pretty long (heh), but since then, using the product for maintenance (once a month or so) has been working out very nicely for me.  hair is definitely growing out thinner.  easy to clean with the brush that comes with the epilator.  haven&#x27;t had to charge it again so far, so the battery life seems to be pretty good. i primarily use it for my underarms and legs.</li>
    <li> It works, but other brands are just as good &amp; cheaper.  The light is not helpful .  The on off switch is difficult to turn.</li>
    <li> I must admit that after reading up on several experiences I was quite weary about epilation (ahh the sting!) But all reviews on Braun silk-epil 7 were good so I gave it a go and was not dissapointed. This device is the perfect care (literally for anywhere) and although the sting from the hairs is slightly daunting in itself it only assures you that this device is working to its exceptional reputation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the pain will decrease in future sessions as your skin adjusts, so so so so so worth it!</li>
    <li> Alright, first I want to send a shoutout to my fellow PCOS sufferers - I feel your assorted pains and problems. I&#x27;m going to address all the areas I have used this on already, but the facial section is dedicated to my sisters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first - epilation is NOT painless -so pull on your big girl panties - I promise you can make it. I do have a pretty high pain threshold, so I know it hurts me less than it might others, but it really isn&#x27;t horrible and it does hurt less the more you do it. Some areas hurt more than others, and the first couple of times you do it, your skin is going to look like a plucked chicken - so don&#x27;t be thinking you are gonna get them legs sexy smooth and then ride out to town in your little black dress! The red bumps go away in a few hours (overnight at the longest) and then everything is back to looking good. The &amp;#34;plucked chicken&amp;#34; effect is lessened if you use it in the shower when your pores are more open, and you can minimize &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; time by putting aloe vera gel on right afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes than came with this did nothing for me. A lot of people say they reduce the pain, I didn&#x27;t think they did anything at all, so to each their own. You should definitely exfoliate your skin before you use it - it will make the hairs stand up better and make them easier to grab.  Just make sure that IF you are using it dry, you get your skin dry and free of any and all lotions, oils, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face - This is the ONLY solution I have ever found for the facial hair that comes from PCOS. I&#x27;ve tried having it waxed, tried waxing it myself, everything. I finally gave up and started shaving every day, my sideburns and my multiple chins ;). This is soo frustrating and can really make you feel like less of a woman when you shave more than your husband does! So, enter my search for hair removal that lasted longer than 5 hours and didn&#x27;t require me to put makeup on every time I left the house. I haven&#x27;t used this onmy sideburns yet, but I have used it on my chin and it is AMAZING.  I have used epilators in the past, and unless you use a GOOD quality one, you wind up just having the hairs break near the root instead of actually being pulled out. This pulls the hairs cleanly, with a minimum of pain, and leaves my skin feels so smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arms - I did my arms dry, but after trying this wet, that is how I will be using it from now on! In my experience with any and all epilators, doing my arms feels like having a series of tiny needles poked in them really quickly, repeatedly. So, not the most pleasant of sensations, but it is completely tolerable and does get better each time you do it. My arms looked PERFECT after the first session - its been a week and so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs - I did my legs for the first time today in the shower- between doing them wet and my arms dry, I have to say the shower makes a HUGE difference.  I was in the shower about ten minutes and did all my other things before I did this, to give my pores time to really open up. Just go slow, and start with a part of your leg that is fleshier. I know we all tend to start with that strip right over the shin, but that is the most painful part - so do yourself a favor and work up to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an AMAZING product, and I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> Extremely painful for thick hair. Not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this gadget but thought if I could avoid two bikini wax appointments, it would be worth it.  I LOVE this toy. It hurts a little at first but then just stop until you get your courage up to try again. Once I used it on my legs, I was hooked. It pulls a little but it stays so smooth. The best benefit is that you can use it as soon as the hair pokes through the skin. With waxing you have an awkward week waiting for the hair to get long enough for a wax. No need to wait just use the epilator.  I have to stay, it hurts on my face but otherwise, my skin is tough enough and the hair is coarse enough, that it works great.</li>
    <li> Works like magic. Very easy to use. Does not make you uncomfortable. Does exactly what its intended to do. Good product.</li>
    <li> useless. i have coarse hair and this didn&#x27;t work at all for me. pulls and is painful but removes little in terms of hair. looking for something that will take care of facial hair and this is definitely not it.  shipped quick but not for me.</li>
    <li> Saves so much money.I used to go for threading earlier and it used hurt bad and was pretty expensive.Now with Braun epilator i can do it at home saves time and money!</li>
    <li> Did not meet expectations at all ..It breaks the hair off and it hurts very badly while epilating..I did not like it at all</li>
    <li> Be sure you stretch the area enough, if not  it will grab your skin. Epilator would not start unless unplugged the cord - not a bad thing but unexpected. Good that pulled hair is capture in the top plastic head, but because the head is needed to take off all the time you need to clean, I am afraid will easily broke.</li>
    <li> Great massaging feature, helps with the minimal pain. Works well wet!</li>
    <li> Hair regrowth is really slower unlike other products I&#x27;ve used promising slower regrowth. I still have not achieved a perfectly smooth result, so it is great that is has a razor too. It does hurt, more the first time. Slower regrowth and not having to purchase and use the alternative products makes it well worth it for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really amazing!! I love it !! :D</li>
    <li> well worth the money! i epilate my face and it works like a charm quick and easy. the only thing is i wish it worked while charging but oh well maybe in a newer model they may decide to do this.</li>
    <li> A person needs to keep a standard weekly appointment with this thing otherwise you need to go back to using a razor and regroup again.</li>
    <li> I decided to get this epilator because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would prefer epilating wet or dry.  It turns out I much prefer going dry because the process takes a long time and I don&#x27;t like being in the shower for that long.  It also seems more effective for me.  I committed myself to using it for a full year since it takes a while to get used to, and it&#x27;s been about 9 months now.  So here are my main review areas so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life:  Battery lasts long enough for me to do my full legs but not much else.  Or I could do my underarms, bikini area, and upper legs.  That&#x27;s annoying because it seems to take about an hour to fully recharge, even if you haven&#x27;t used it down to low battery.  In fact, I haven&#x27;t timed it but it seems to take almost as long to charge after just 5 minutes of use as it would if you had run the battery down completely.  Since I use it dry, there&#x27;s no reason for me to have an epilator that can&#x27;t operate while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:  My results varied for each part of my body.  The attachments make this really good for my underarms and bikini area (and beyond, with a lot of care and topical painkiller).  It works ok on the fine hair of my upper legs, but I get a horrendous amount of broken hairs and ingrowns on my lower legs.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things like going slower--so it takes forever--and varying the angle, but I think that part of my body is just not well suited to epilating.  I suspect that going against the hair growth (like the instructions say) contributes to the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise:  All epilators are probably fairly loud, and this one is no exception.  I&#x27;ve reluctantly used it in hotels and thin-walled apartments, and try to do it at times when the neighbors aren&#x27;t around because I find the noise embarrassing and potentially annoying to others.  One effective way to stifle the noise is to use it under water in the tub.  I still got satisfactory results that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other features:  This comes with a good variety of attachments.  I personally don&#x27;t like the one that&#x27;s meant for the bikini zone because I find it too narrow, so I use the one for underarms on all my sensitive areas.  I haven&#x27;t tried the razor feature so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  I usually find the light useful, but not always necessary.  I really wish there was a way to disable it to save battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I prefer epilating dry so my next epilator will be corded.  That way I won&#x27;t be limited by battery life.  I will keep this one because the attachments work well on my underarms and bikini zone.  It may also become handy for quick touch-ups, both dry and in the shower.  I think it&#x27;s a good model to start with so you can see if you prefer wet or dry epilating, and also because it has a lot of features for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Functional and easy use. Enough tools to change according to the purpose we need short, very short hair.</li>
    <li> So, this is my first epilator, and after having had a suspenseful first moments, I finally put it against my skin and it actually wasn&#x27;t that bad. The pain was tolerable, although I did use the pre-epilation wipes, so I dont know if that had much to do with it (I put it in the fastest mode). I started in a part of my leg that I knew wouldn&#x27;t hurt (knowledge left over from previous sugar waxing adventures!) and moved on from there, though I didn&#x27;t go too high up to my thigh cuz I know it&#x27;s gonna hurt more. I mean, shaving with regular razors was enough to irritate my skin even with soap. Razors never really worked for me and because my skin is light you could still see the dark hair under my skin :( just terrible. Hence, the epilator. It works really well, I liked it cuz its just like using tweezers! the initial redness after epilation went away fairly quickly too. It got most or all of the hairs, so I was really pleased. Of course, if you&#x27;re going to epilate, you have to exfoliate, and I&#x27;m really new to exfoliating so my skin didn&#x27;t look perfect due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t exfoliate at all during any of my past hair removal efforts. The result? Ingrowns :( *sigh* I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll go away as I keep exfoliating though, I bought exfoliating gloves and also antibacterial soap so I wont get any skin infections. I have to buy some alcohol free lotion to hydrate my skin though. (the things I put myself through!) Anyways, I do love how my skin is mostly smooth! :)  It&#x27;s an awesome feeling; something I could barely achieve with razors, and even then, it didn&#x27;t last long. Making sugar wax was just too messy (though economical), and I burned myself last time. :( I was torn between this model and the one that has the exfoliating head. I don&#x27;t regret my decision but it would have been easier to do the whole exfoliating thing with that one (I would think) I haven&#x27;t tried most of the extra caps, except the shaver one. The epilator is relatively easy to clean and sanitize as well. :) If you do decide to get one, Happy Epilating! You&#x27;ll at least like, if not love the results. remember to exfoliate!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I think it&#x27;s only ok, which is really disappointing to me. I did research and read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere. One beauty mag rated it their favorite. I got it a little over two months ago, and I was fairly happy at first but it seems like it quickly lost its effectiveness. I literally just spent 15 minutes on one lower arm. It would not pick up the hairs, and I just kept having to go over and over and over the same areas.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to ask a friend to borrow hers (Emjoi eRase pro 60) to do the other arm just to check it out, see if my expectations were too high, especially since the hair had gotten a bit long. Other arm, same area, same length of hair...5 min max.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I&#x27;d have to use this one every day to avoid stubble. My hair grows fast (my head too) so what am I supposed to do? I don&#x27;t have an hour every day just to epilate my arms and legs!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try to return it, as I just bought the one by Emjoi.</li>
    <li> I will admit it works but at what cost. I get really bad razer burn so i thought this may be good for me i knew it would hurt but i didnt think it would hurt like it did. I dont know the reviews are so good perhaps im just a baby but ive got five tattoos some of which are right on my back bone spine area and i would definately compare the pain and feeling to an epilator. It hurt on my arms the least then my legs and dont even think about the bikini area a split second of even trying i feared i went blind from the pain and trama ha ha. Blah not a fan but perhaps its just not for me</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing. She uses it on me just to watch me squirm in pain. All and all, it works magic.</li>
    <li> My first time experience with this product was quite effective. It&#x27;s painful for the first time but got used to it. The light on it is very helpful. Like the plug in charger as i don&#x27;t have to worry about getting batteries</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!&lt;br /&gt;No more wasting my money on waxing. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I will still wax sometimes for the hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;With waxing you have to wait for the hair to grow but with this... If you decide to go to the pool, you use it on the spot,&lt;br /&gt;and you&#x27;re ready. Loooove it!&lt;br /&gt;It hurts in the beginning but then you get used to it. BELIEVE ME!&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to family members, they tried it only once and gave up, their loss. I keep on telling them......YOU GET USED TO IT.&lt;br /&gt;The only minus to this product is that I always find my self looking for the cord LOL</li>
    <li> I was a little afraid to try this, having heard that these devices could be painful, but after reading the instructions (not to press to hard) I have to say - having given birth - that I could bear the pain, it actually wasn&#x27;t too bad, except for the occasional jolt. It charged quickly, is intuitive to use, and worked well. My only negative comment is that it&#x27;s a little loud (which adds to the frightening effect). I would prefer my personal beauty &#x27;power&#x27; tools be a little less noisy.</li>
    <li> Trust the bad reviews. After searching for weeks for the best epilator, I went with highest reviewed product in Amazon. The first time use was absolutely fantastic. The second time I used it was two months after first use with spare hair here and there. It would not pick a hair even rolling over it more than ten times. Very very very disappointed since I can&#x27;t return it at this point.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for years. But it is so difficult to keep up with waxing. Epilator is so easy to use and have not shave past 15 days and i am good.</li>
    <li> I use this thing constantly!  It works really well but for me it works much better dry than wet.  I use it on my legs, armpits, and face.  The legs and face aren&#x27;t bad at all pain-wise.  The first time I epilated my armpits, though, I just about cried!  After the first time, you hardly feel a thing so it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  No more bumps or black hairs visible through the skin!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after endless hours of research and deciding to go with what is considered to be the top rated epilator. (The Silk Epil 9 has just been released but I went with the 7681 as it was on sale for $78 and the 9 was $130)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m caucasian with fair skin and light blonde hair. I&#x27;m a bit of a baby when it comes to pain but i have 2 tattoos so it&#x27;s not like i&#x27;m the biggest wimp!&lt;br /&gt;First I tried epilating wet:&lt;br /&gt;Nice warm bath, 2 ibuprofen and a margarita....&lt;br /&gt;Legs  - sharp stingy sensation, wasn&#x27;t picking up most hairs, gave me red bumps, took too long and wasn&#x27;t seeing good results so i gave up.&lt;br /&gt;Underarms - too painful, I lasted about 5 seconds!  felt like it was ripping the skin even though I held my arm high and pulled the skin taught. Some blood spots. Couldn&#x27;t finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 days later I tried epilating dry:&lt;br /&gt;Legs -  Didn&#x27;t pick up smaller hairs, left &#x27;stubble&#x27; like it just broke the hair off without removing the root. Required multiple passes. Left red bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Underarms - Very painful. Felt like it was shredding my skin, even though I held it extremely taught. Made me bleed. Couldn&#x27;t finish even half of one!&lt;br /&gt;Bikini line - Quite painful and left red bumps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s a poor piece of equipment that just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I wouldn&#x27;t mind the pain if I actually saw good results but it just doesn&#x27;t support it&#x27;s claims. Like &amp;#34;removing hair as fine as a grain of sand&amp;#34;  Lies lies lies!  Disappointing Braun.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Have not tried all of the features but the main one for major body parts seems to work well..the face feature can be a little uncomfortable but acceptable given the speed with which the unit works. the length of the hair to be removed plays an important part in the efficiency of the removal.&lt;br /&gt;Have not addressed all of the cleaning functions yet . Hope it proves to be as simple as the instructions says.</li>
    <li> The caps are not too useful. In fact, I have not used any of them yet. The wet and dry function, which I considered quite exciting at first does not measure up to my expectations either. It turns out that epilating in the shower is both less convenient and less efficient than dry epilation. And because of this wet and dry function, you cannot epilate while the machine is connected to the cord for charging. So, if your battery goes down, you need to plug it in and wait with 1/2 epilated legs which I find pretty annoying. But one thing I love about this machine is the light! Simply brilliant-helps you see all the sneaky hair and makes it possible to epilate well even in a dim room.</li>
    <li> Very painful. I returned it.</li>
    <li> It just pulled the hairs using it correctly with correct pressure, it still left patches, red and blotched areas. Several in the family tried it thinking I was using it incorrectly only to comment that they couldn&#x27;t believe how painful it was - they get a full waxing instead of using it.</li>
    <li> I have always used Braun and will love it always.</li>
    <li> I bought the original about 20 years ago and recently had to replace it. Long lasting results and easy to use. Love it.</li>
    <li> Hello. Now usually I never comment on anything I buy. Buy this was a very big purchase for me and to be honest I was skeptical and worried I wasted 100 bucks. Well a little bit more. So hopefully someone is reading this and I hope it helps. I&#x27;ve done a lot of research before I purchase. And to be honest. It works. Not what I expected though. I was expecting like a new fresh shaved peg after using this. But it did not give me that. But when I check the epilator when I&#x27;m done using it I do see alot of hair... Alot. So much it&#x27;s so discussing I have that much. So yes it does pull my hairs. But it does not give me a smooth sexy leg. But my hairs have grown in much thinner and lighter that even without epilating for a week you can&#x27;t tell I have hairs unless you have a magnifying glass. Lol. And also, when I first used it my legs were so red and so many red bumps. But it does get better after each use. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and a half. I still get a few bumps here and there. But they fade in like a hour. Also biggest thing! Exfoliating is very important when using this. I didn&#x27;t exfoliat one night because of laziness and the next day I got ingrown hairs. It was horrible.  But if you exfoliat before and after use you should be fine. Do not recommend putting on lotion after epilating... painful... it burns. Lol. Just wash your leg and exfoliat. If you think this is a easier way to shave and your trying to find the lazy way out think again. I&#x27;m all about lazy but this does involve work. But in time it&#x27;s worth it. I only have to use the epilator like once a week. And I&#x27;m german.... so I&#x27;m a very hairy person. And this does work. Now with pain.... it does hurt. It hurt so bad first use on my legs. I couldn&#x27;t finish. And I have high pain tolerance.  I mean I&#x27;ve been shot in the arm and didn&#x27;t cry once. Just to describe the kinda pain I&#x27;ve been through.  So this does hurt. I originally bought this mostly for my arm pits.... hell no.... my arm pits bleeds when I use this. But I&#x27;m still trying.... I&#x27;m not giving up. And so now I can sorta do a quick swift on my arm pit and not scream lol. So I&#x27;m making progress and maybe one day I&#x27;ll be able to use it on my arm pits. But not today that&#x27;s for sure. I haven&#x27;t even thought to use this &amp;#34;down below&amp;#34;.... no way.... closest I&#x27;ve done was my belly and that wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought. So all in all it does in fact work. I do feel it pulling hairs and I see all lot of hair on the epilator when I&#x27;m done. I wish I can insert a pic so u can see the before and after. It doesn&#x27;t give me smooth legs... but it does pull my hairs and d my hairs are thinner and lighter and easier to pull after each use. I do think it&#x27;s worth it. Expecially for this price. If your still worry just go to target and did get a cheap 20 dollar epilator and test to see if you like it. Me on the other hand am to cheap and rather risk it. I love the trimmer it comes with. Freaking awesome. So do more research guys. Always do research before purchasing a big item. I personally like it. I don&#x27;t love love it but in time maybe I will. I love my hairs getting litter and thinner. Pretty awesome.</li>
    <li> I like it, very easy to use ),thank u !</li>
    <li> A few years ago I tried epilating my legs and it hurt so badly I went back to Nair-ing my legs.  So I thought I&#x27;d give it another try, thinking that technology may have changed.  It hasn&#x27;t - it hurts just as much as it did previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I appreciate the features this model has, such as being cordless, the light to see the hair better, and being able to use this around water (wet - dry), it was useless to try and epilate in my tub&#x27;s shower as the lighting is bad in that area of the bathroom, and my eyesight isn&#x27;t good without my glasses in a steamy shower.  I tried it in a more well-lit area (dry method); it didn&#x27;t matter if my legs were wet or dry, it still hurt. I did only one leg and finished off with Nair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great as far as hair removal, so I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars.  We all have different tolerances when it comes to pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the different caps this one has, I don&#x27;t have the nerve to try this on any body parts other than my legs since they seem to be the toughest.  So if you are looking to save a little money and want a wet-dry model, go for a cheaper epilator with less attachments if you plan on using this for the legs only, such as this model:  [[ASIN:B0077PLNB6 Braun Se7181 Silk-Epil 7181 Wet and Dry Epilator, Pink]]</li>
    <li> The light does help see what spots you are missing. is fast and the fact that you can charge and don´t need to keep it plugged helps a lot</li>
    <li> I do love that this gets all the hair. It works as it is supposed to and I find no flaws with the product other than my low tolerance for hair pulling. I have to admit I can&#x27;t use it as much as I would like because it is pretty painful for me.  I have tattoos that hurt less getting them than using this on my legs.  I had to buy numbing cream to use it most places.  I think for me waxing is the way to go.  I find it painful but at least it&#x27;s over faster.</li>
    <li> This is really painful- at least as bad as waxing.  Also, you will get ingrown hairs if you use it for bikini line.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator and I will never shave again. So far I have had this one week and have epilated my legs 2x, my arms and my arm pits once.&lt;br /&gt;The pain on my legs and arms really isn&#x27;t a factor at all. There was some pain the 1st time I epilated my legs but the second time there was no pain because the hair was short. My arm pits hurt pretty badly and I had to take breaks. I believe my arm pits will hurt less and less each time. I do plan to do a complete Brazilian bikini with this epilator. The best part about this is I don&#x27;t have to plan my outfits based on if I shaved or not because I am always hairless, this method of hair removal lasts so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not as painful as I thought&lt;br /&gt;Pain goes away with use&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hairless for a long time&lt;br /&gt;Cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not remove every single hair&lt;br /&gt;Takes longer than shaving&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a small number of ingrown hairs despite exfoliating regularly.</li>
    <li> I have used another Braun (plug-in) epilator for many years. I needed a new one and preferred something cordless.&lt;br /&gt;After a lot of research, I decided to go for this one. Not only is it cordless, but also waterproof. It has many great attachments and really does remove shorter hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product and it&#x27;s made hair removal easier for me.</li>
    <li> I tried it for the first time, I like it so far</li>
    <li> I like my old Braun that I got 10 years ago better, it picked up every little hair, but the new one is just o.k. I had to remove the cap in order for it to pick up facial hair, the caps provided were inefficient.  I expect better from Braun</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I buy this years before?  Just love it!</li>
    <li> I was really worried that it would be super painful. Granted, the first time I used the epilator on my underarms it was a soul-seeking experience. But just as the booklet says, once your skin/hair gets used to the sensation, it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing for me is that a week and a half or even two weeks after using it, my legs are still super smooth. It&#x27;s fantastic! Want to throw on a bathing suit and go to the pool spontaneously? No problem, no rushed shaving. Best beauty purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;The product is overall great, but the included Olay towelettes that are supposed to lessen the feeling of the razor heads against my skin do not really work for me&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Beautiful beautiful epilator I love it.it&#x27;s amazing for arms and legs.</li>
    <li> This product accomplish with all my requirements and expectations. I can recommend this product a hundred percent. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> After using it for awhile I have to give this Epilator one star.  This just does not remover hair.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> This Braun Epilator is good except that the slit for the smallest attachment is very small and hence not very effective.</li>
    <li> Meet all my expectations. Works great! Thanks to it&#x27;s speed, epilation is no longer so time consuming and it damages the skin much less. The smart light is very useful as well!</li>
    <li> Thank you Braun. Thank you Amazon. I am really happy with this purchase. So far, it works great even though I have course hair. I am terrified to do my bikini, but I figure a vodka martini and really loud music may help get me through it ^_^</li>
    <li> i love it but the first couple times are hard to get through!</li>
    <li> I love that you can use it in the shower, an it is portable no cords.&lt;br /&gt;It does  an excellent job at removing all the hair I would highly recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> sucks! didn&#x27;t work well. Low charge all the time. DOestn clean well. NOT recommended</li>
    <li> OK this is a hard review because how can you give 5 stars to something that hurts like HELL.... well, it gives good results.  I use this on my face and when you first start out using it, well if you have never sworn in your life, you will.  If you swear already it will be worse.  Let me assure you this is temporary turrets syndrome and will resolve itself after several uses.  Kind of like building a callase on your hands from raking leaves for a living.  I am very happy AFTER I have finished with the results as I said.  I have not used this on anything other than my chin so I am not sure how much swearing you would do with any other parts.  I am guessing the results last a different length of time for everyone but I am good for about a month.  I sweat when I have to do it again but its better than picking those bad boys one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
    <li> Very cool item, effekt than I expected more.</li>
    <li> And it doesn&#x27;t hurt, but that might also be because my legs have been epilized, and nothing less than a chain saw is gonna cause me any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Braun Epilator. I have to say, it is a pleasant and decidedly huge improvement on the previous one, particularly for girls like me who aren&#x27;t really that hairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Epilator vows to grab small hairs and make short work of them. The pattern of hair growth I have on my legs always HAS been short. I&#x27;m not very hairy, but obviously the hair is there. The previous Epilator caused some irritation by me trying to make it pick up the relatively fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problems with this model. It grabs the hairs and gets them the first time around. It&#x27;s also easy to handle, wet or dry, and because it&#x27;s light, you won&#x27;t get tired trying to zap your leg hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent model. If you&#x27;ve epilated before but couldn&#x27;t take the pain and irritation, you really owe it to yourself to try it again. The machine has made vast improvements, it hurts a lot less, and it works a lot better.</li>
    <li> I have tested and reviewed several epilators in the past.  This model, with the extra specialty guides, is the hands down Best of the Best out of all of the epilators that I have tested.  This is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product!</li>
    <li> I had been using a Panasonic (ES-WD71) for years until it needed to be replaced. I bought another one, but it seemed like the quality was not as good. I decide to spend a bit more, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. This epilator is quiter, faster and more versatile. I love that it has the light, too. It is actually a really useful feature. The shaving attachment is great, too.</li>
    <li> I used to  shave, but hated it. Then I waxed, but it was so messy at home and too time consuming at a spa SO after recommendations from friends I tried this gadget. Amazing! People...it&#x27;ll hurt. But the up side is that you get used to it pretty quickly. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Takes a few sessions to get use to the pain. Works great.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my friend birthday, it comes 3 days late.So I did not go to the party becuse I spent my money her to buy this item.I am so upset.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 20 times and now the charge only lasts about 20 minutes. While the epilator works well, the battery does not last long and is pretty pathetic.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I buy a epilator. It&#x27;s what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I used braun silk epil for years and this one is the worst. It cuts the hair and very very noisy Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to discover this handy little tool!  My arms and legs are baby smooth and I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was painful. So worth it.</li>
    <li> Buyers, please note that this product is using battery ONLY. That means when it&#x27;s plugged in to be charged, it&#x27;s not gonna work! This is a trouble when the battery charge is over and you should wait for it to be charged again. And obviously batteries die after a while and the Epilator won&#x27;t be usable anymore. Having the battery is very helpful but not being able to use it while being charged is annoying (However I know this is for our own safety as this empilator is usable in the shower).</li>
    <li> Great product! First time to use this kind of hair removal and I was pleasantly  surprised at how well it worked.</li>
    <li> Having to use more often than I had hoped. Ready to see it make a difference soon.</li>
    <li> Tries to do too much. Not good for facial hair. It is too large. Good for under arms and legs.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective at removing hair, but I have to warn that it was quite painful the first couple times.  That being said, I don&#x27;t think I will be going back to a raiser.  Love the results from the Silk-epil.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator under two years ago and it&#x27;s not working anymore. It has only one year warranty and the minimum repair cost is over $30. I regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I accidentally dropped this unit before using it the first time and a small piece broke off. There is no warranty for accidents and now I need to send the unit to the head office across the country to be repaired, at my cost. I don&#x27;t think it should have broken so easily, so I doubt the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Before I found this one, I bought another brand....and it did not pick up the fine hairs on my face. This one works. It has several different tops (or guards) so that it can be modified to suit the body part. It also includes a shaver. So far, I have used it dry but the instructions say it might work even better when wet. Wish I had bought this one the first time because it is exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> Too good..No pain when used on wet skin</li>
    <li> It runs well. a bit slow. charge it first each time before using. can&#x27;t use it while charging. must plan ahead or keep it plugged in all the time</li>
    <li> I think experiences with this product are going to vary wildly depending on the type of hair and skin each person has, so I&#x27;ll start by saying that I have extremely sensitive skin, prone to razor-burn and ingrown hairs, plus my hair tends to grow back at an very fast rate, so I am probably not an ideal candidate for epilation.  Also used this for my legs, I haven&#x27;t yet tried it on my armpits or bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, yes, it&#x27;s painful; but I&#x27;m a big baby about pain, and I was able to stick it out, so I think most people can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this is not a use-once-a-month-and-forget-it tool. Hair grows back fast enough that I have to do touch-ups with it every single day. However the regrowth is sporadic, so it&#x27;s not really bad doing the daily maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, my legs are not nearly as smooth as after a close shave. Most hairs are plucked, but some will be clipped instead, plus there are always some that are too short for the tool to grab. No matter how much time I take, I always still have a bit of stubbly texture left behind. Not nearly as prickly as shaving stubble, but definitely not silky smooth. I also have to use the tool at night before bed rather than in the morning, as my legs will be covered with little red welts from the plucking for a few hours after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been using this for almost a year, and I think I prefer it to shaving, but only because my razor burn was painful and unsightly. This is no great solution, but it&#x27;s better than razors for someone with skin as bad as mine. At least until I can afford laser treatments.</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research before buying it as it was my first experience with epilators.&lt;br /&gt;I used to go for waxing when I was in India. Now being in the USA wanted a product for hair removal that is not much expensive and can be used at home any time.&lt;br /&gt;Its a very good product I must say.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used in both dry &amp; wet conditions. Suitable for sensitive areas too with its special attachment for sensitive areas. Comes with a special attachment for using on face as well.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is good. Skin is smooth for around three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Not painful when used on hands and legs. Slightly painful when used for underarms and bikini area. With repeated this pain becomes bearable.&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> So, I purchased this as I am in female in the military and I travel very often. I decided to go with this model as it was wet/dry and I wanted that versatility. After decided the price was worth it, I am so glad I purchased this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to preface this with the fact that I have a high pain tolerance. I don&#x27;t wince when I normally get waxed. The first time I used this the pain was almost unbearable dry (even with the wipes that came with the product), so I had to do it in the bathtub. I was able to submerge the entire epilator, and the pain was greatly reduced. However, I noticed that if you utilize this product in the bathtub it doesn&#x27;t do as great as a job, and you have to go over the same area multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently deployed, and the water we do have is rationed. I use this dry, and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the pain. If you are highly sensitive, I think you should stick with shaving. This hurts, but it is bearable for me and I don&#x27;t notice it anymore. For a couple hours after using it, your skin will be red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, my hair doesn&#x27;t grow back at all for a couple of weeks. If I want to have completely smooth skin, I utilize this and the next day I will shave to get rid of all the tiny hairs it didn&#x27;t pick up the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would purchase this product again if I somehow lost or broke it! I am in love with it, and I will continually use it.</li>
    <li> Buying this is so worth it!!! I have used this 2-3 times already and my leg hair is now thinner and less visible. I don&#x27;t have to worry now about shaving my legs every time I want to wear something short (and getting some painful cuts in the process).&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend epilating under running warm water for first timers. The sensation is the same when you get a wax. It&#x27;s painful, yes, but you&#x27;ll get used to it in no time. I have been epilating without warm water ever since the second session.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick delivery, works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, 100% recommended seller</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied and would buy it again</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months now. It takes a little getting used to, but it has been a solid, durable product with no issues.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I love it. Works perfect. Not very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removes all the hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice shape and weigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love all the different attachments. Those are the coolest thing.</li>
    <li> There’s an initial sting, more of a slight discomfort that comes with the first use, but you get used to it quickly. Most importantly, most hairs come out by their roots, minimizing the time between sessions. The skin is a little red afterward, but that fades quickly. Very effective and a good alternative to shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but kind of noisy and I&#x27;ve had other Braun that actually worked better</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I got it after having my first brazilian wax. I used it to make my wax last longer and I am not going to say it doesn&#x27;t hurt but it definitely does not hurt as bad as i expected!! It works perfectly!!! It was definitely worth the money! I would buy this again in a heart beat!</li>
    <li> I had bug expectations to this, but I got disappointing. It&#x27;s my second time trying an epilator, first time it didn&#x27;t take the hair. But this one is my second try and it did take most of the hair, however it&#x27;s almost like it &#x27;cut&#x27; it instead of pulling it from the roots. After epilating I run my hands up and down my legs and it felt like 10 hours after I shaved my legs, I could feel the hair. And also, it was very painful. I used the lowest setting, I got used to it after a while, but I tried the bikini line also and it was horrible. I bled and got blisters from it, still red and it&#x27;s been a week after using it. I will stick to shaving for now until they find out how darker blonds can use laser hair removal lol.</li>
    <li> This product is great, no more pain epoilations no more hair , everything is so much easy from the day when i buyed this epilator</li>
    <li> Gets the job done! Yes the first few times are definitely painful (for us hairy Italian women) but it is SO much better than having to shave every day!! Now I can go two weeks and not have to worry about a thing! My recommendation is just to do one part of your body at a time. I did the lower half of my legs first and concentrated on those the first two weeks before moving to the upper legs. Then I concentrated on the upper legs before moving to the arms and etc etc. It just makes me dread it less knowing that I&#x27;m not worrying about having to epilate EVERYTHING in one day.</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this product is because I hate shaving and figured this would keep my skin smoother for a longer period of time. I think that it was worth the money for under my arms because it pulls out all your hair and you don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn but it scarred up my legs! I have had to switch back to shaving my legs because not only would I have red bumps all over my legs afterward but it left my legs looking blotchy and because of the way the epilator works by pulling the hair, I resulted with ingrown hairs everywhere! Maybe my skin is more sensitive than others? To sum it up. For armpits: good. For legs: bad.</li>
    <li> My wife just loves this product</li>
    <li> Works well, painful but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I had the Brown Silk Epil for years, at least 4 now and all of a sudden, it stopped spinning. Wanted to buy the same exact one, but it wasn&#x27; t available, so I bought this one. Even tough it costed twice as much, it&#x27;s not worth it. It&#x27;s not working, at least not the way they say it should be, not for me...</li>
    <li> I just received my Braun Silk epil 7 in the mail yesterday from my BzzAgent and tried it out this morning. At first it was a little painful which I expected since this is effectively a tweezing machine but after a few minutes you get more used to it. It was very easy to use and the results are great! My legs are smooth and silky and no stubble whatsoever. I can&#x27;t wait to see how long these results last. It took a little longer than shaving but not much and if my legs stay hair free for weeks like they say than I&#x27;ll have saved tons more time in the long run. I was skeptical that it would work well on my fine blonde hairs but it worked great! I have had an older model from a different company in the past but Braun&#x27;s seems to work much better. I love it!</li>
    <li> I got my epilator a few days ago and so far I love it. It shaves very smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> amazing! no other words to describe it. If you haven&#x27;t been waxing/epilating for a long time it might hurt for you in the beginning so you might have to build up a pain threshold.</li>
    <li> The product does the job well. I used this Epilator for 8-10 times and did not have any problems. But now the battery is not holding charge anymore. It stops running after 5 mins of use.</li>
    <li> Best epilator I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> It works perfectly and arrived when stated. Happy for my deal!</li>
    <li> I wanted the Braun Silk-Epil 7681 epilator for facial hair.  Since I have gotten older and now need to take various medications that seem to promote the growth of facial hair in various places, I wanted something more effective and long-lasting than just using an electric shaver on a daily basis.  I found that in this Braun.  I had tried other types in the past with the little tweezers, etc and they were either painful, extremely noisy or practically ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that would work on the upper lip as well as the chin area.  I wanted something with the least amount of pain and followup redness and/or rash as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times using the Braun I was hesitant and didn&#x27;t hold it the right way and kept missing hairs, but I finally got the hang of it. I do not have to use it every day, just when I feel the growth.  I will say that the hairs that do grow back in are not as prolific or seem to be as dark as when I just used an electric shaver.  Maybe I just think they are not, but the Braun definitely makes it easier to deal with the growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the discomfort, well, it&#x27;s not like just using an electric shaver by any means, but the end result is worth the mild discomfort and you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what I wanted the Braun for, I am quite satisfied.  It&#x27;s easy to use; it&#x27;s fits in the hand nicely and so far has been quite effective.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this thing! I bought it after deciding that waxing wasn&#x27;t worth it because it doesn&#x27;t last long enough, plucking takes too long (&amp; destroys my armpits in the process), &amp; shaving wasn&#x27;t cutting it (pun not intended lol)! Waxing only lasts for a week with me; I don&#x27;t know, but my armpit hair just refuses to chill out. Plucking takes forever &amp; made my armpits unbareable sore. Shaving leaves a shadow from the root of the hair under my skin; I hate that shadow, so I decided to epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interest of full disclosure, epilating is like no other pain I&#x27;ve felt! I&#x27;m not saying that to scare you, I&#x27;m saying that so you&#x27;re aware! If you shave, obviously that&#x27;s not a pain. Waxing doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as this because everything&#x27;s being taken out at once, whereas this device takes out each hair one by one. &amp; you feel EVERY pluck! Plucking doesn&#x27;t really hurt to me, so it&#x27;s nothing compared to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain of epilating is more like a very quick, shocking sting. This is my first epilator, so I didn&#x27;t know what to think; honestly, the pain caught me off guard. It&#x27;s a quick sting in the smallest portion of skin possible. You&#x27;d think pain like this couldn&#x27;t be possible, but after using this I&#x27;m certain ants feel everything when you squash them, it doesn&#x27;t matter how small something is; it will feel the pain. Yeah, this epilator brought new insights lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, I TRULY recommend using this on wet skin! You want to shower &amp; exfoliate before using this, so your skin is softer &amp; hair removal is easier. You want to use a shave creme doesn&#x27;t lather; if you use one that lathers, your armpits will sting the life out of you. I use the Coochi Shave System &amp; have been for years. This shave creme moisturizes your skin &amp; protects it, so there&#x27;s no itching/irritation after shaving. At all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend using the slowest speed if this is your first time epilating. Also make sure your device is charged. Other than all of that, I love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend!ove this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Absolutely does not work. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different version of a Braun product, the [[ASIN:B004QI8UJK Braun SE 5280 Silk Epil 5 Epilator With Ice Glove, Pink]] since May of last year and have had great results with it.  It really wasn&#x27;t that painful for me and over time, I got used to what little discomfort there was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This newer model actually hurts to use, even if it is just as effective.  I&#x27;ve tried using it both wet in the shower and tub, out of it with wet skin and with dry skin and it&#x27;s painful each way.  I&#x27;ve also tried it using the unit fully charged and unplugged and while using it plugged in, and get the same results - I was concerned the tweezers just weren&#x27;t moving fast enough and that might be the reason for the pain but it didn&#x27;t appear to be so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discomfort aside, the unit does an excellent job removing hair quickly.  I have no complaints with either of my Braun units on that count.  Whether it&#x27;s from my face, underarms or legs, fine hair or coarse hair, it all gets taken care of pretty quickly.  I can do my legs in well under ten minutes and it lasts for up to a month or so.</li>
    <li> I have always been waxing or shaving and this is the first time that I ordered an epilator. I will be lying if I say that it doesn&#x27;t hurt but it&#x27;s not unbearable. But this epilator is way better than waxing because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It removes the hair very neatly but you might have to run the epilator on the same spot more than once, sometimes more than twice too. But once the majority of hair are removed, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Also, unlike waxing, you can epilate on the same spot as many times as you like, because it will only remove the hair and can not do anything to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. You can do it anytime and there is no planning needed to heat the wax and al that jazz.&lt;br /&gt;3. If you have been avoiding getting rid of excess hair and have reached the point that  you can no longer avoid..  you can have hair-free legs, arms and underarms in about 1 hour with zero mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the little light that it has and the fact that it can follow the contours of your body for epilating on difficult areas like elbow and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am holding back from giving it a five star is because I was quite disappointed by its performance as a wet epilator. I expected wet epilation to be easier, but the epilator was not pulling the hair at all. I felt the dry epilation was much faster and gave cleaner results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly recommend this product to anyone who wants to move over from other hair removal methods, its a bit expensive but I hope that it will pay off for itself pretty soon.</li>
    <li> Buy an epilator. I suggest this one. I just bought it and I&#x27;m mostly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Buy a topical anesthetic spray.  I won&#x27;t recommend any because they all mostly suck, but hopefully the added numbness will take the edge off what you&#x27;re about to do.&lt;br /&gt;Buy a hair growth inhibitor. I&#x27;ve used Ultra Hair Away. I can&#x27;t actually say I&#x27;m hairless, but in combination with epilation results should be far more noticeable than with shaving. And at the very least, it leaves your skin super soft after application.&lt;br /&gt;Get into the tub and soak your legs and arms and anywhere you plan on removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;EXFOLIATE THE CRAP OUT OF YOUR SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;(But don&#x27;t give yourself a rash, you&#x27;re going to be in pain anyway)&lt;br /&gt;The pre-epilation wipes don&#x27;t really do anything except make the epilator more readily glide over your skin. Whatever.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this epilator in the tub. I would recommend getting out, patting dry, and applying your anesthetic spray liberally. Wait a little bit. Hopefully, it works.&lt;br /&gt;Now, epilate against hair growth. I would seriously recommend you go VERY slow. Epilating straight up your leg will hurt like a b!tch.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it took me two days to get both arms, legs, and pits. Because that&#x27;s how much it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;After you have completed, apply the hair growth inhibitor. You might notice your skin appears to have suddenly contracted smallpox. That&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;ll go away in a day or so. Take some aspirin.&lt;br /&gt;Remember why you did this and curse yourself for being so vain.&lt;br /&gt;Epilate again in a few days when you notice strays and such. Remember to use your hair growth inhibitor.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be happy later. It gets easier and your skin gets smoother. Good luck to you sadomasochistic freaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-UPDATE FEBRUARY 24th 2014-&lt;br /&gt;So, like most of the users keep saying, epilate about every week after your initial first time.&lt;br /&gt;It will upkeep on hair that may have broken at the skin, or new hairs that have begun to grow to replace the old, or old hairs you missed. My pits are so fresh now I just have to pluck a couple strays with regular tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to venture south of the belt.he old, or old hairs you missed. My pits are so fresh now I just have to pluck a couple strays with regular tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to venture south of the belt.</li>
    <li> Will never use another razor again on my legs or bikini area. Honestly, the first time I used this I had to get drunk but after that its a piece of cake. Pair this with Emjoi After Epilation Cream with Hair Growth Inhibitor, 5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET7658/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;And you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> This epilator has changed my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a 22 year old woman who has spent countless amount of time and money trying to remove hair, I wish I would have found this sooner. I&#x27;ve shaved, used creams, electrolysis, self-tweezed and waxed and none of those methods have been better than this one in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s $100, it&#x27;s an investment that can save you thousands. With this epilator specifically, I can remove hair anywhere whether it be coarse hair or peach fuzz because of the power of the epilator and the different heads it has which allow you to use the epilator in different areas. Not to mention, it comes with a very nice shaver - just in case! I use it on my legs, as a brazilian hair remover, bikini area, armpits, peach fuzz on the face, the trail line on my stomach and to remove peach fuzz on my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time using the epilator it is really really painful. No pain, no gain, right? After the first time, the hair grows back so thin and sparse that it is very easy and much less painful to maintain. The first time you epilate you don&#x27;t get all the hairs, however over time it feels like you&#x27;re practically hairless! Again, the hair grows back much much thinner. My electrolysis was against tweezing, however I have not had any issues with it other than needing to maintain redness or bumpiness after using the Braun Silk-epil 7. But the redness and bumpiness would happen with any epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a $100 investment and makes managing hair 100 times better. I wish I would have known about this product sooner!!</li>
    <li> Not suitable for those with course hair as ingrown hairs are an issue if the hairs are not removed from the root and it has to be used weekly. Not all of the hairs are taken out by the root. Some break off and have to grow back, requiring the user to treat a area weekly. You&#x27;re better off waxing if you want lasting results.</li>
    <li> Love it! Definitely get it! It&#x27;s easy to use and made with great quality!</li>
    <li> Before I bought this item I was a regular waxer. My hair grows fast and it is dark, plus I have sensitive skin so I am prone to irritation from shaving and get ingrown hairs easily. I figured I&#x27;d try it and if it totally sucked I could always return it.&lt;br /&gt;I have found I like this product a lot. The pain for using the epilator is easier for me to handle than waxing. I can go at my own pace, I don&#x27;t have to take time out of my day to get waxed, I have kids so it&#x27;s nice to be able to use the Silk-epil when it&#x27;s convent for me rather than having to take time to go all the way to my esthetician. I can epilate in the privacy and comfort of my own home and I have saved a TON of money. It has already paid for itself in less than a month. I use it on my legs, underarms and bikini line and it takes me just under 30 minutes to do all three. I tried to use it on my lip but it was too painful.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it a full five stars is because I wish I could do my lip too and it is hard to get my knees really good.&lt;br /&gt;If you are used to waxing you should try it. If you usually shave it might take you a little bit to adjust to it.</li>
    <li> I think its Okay. Not as great as expected and the extra attachments for upper lips etc are overrated .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun silk-epil for maybe more than 15 years (wow!) This is my 3rd one. I thought I was getting different size heads but actually what you are getting is a couple of covers with different size opening in them so you still have the whole head there bothering you if you want to get in a small spot. I do not use it on my face so I really don&#x27;t care as much but still a disappointing fixture.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it under water but I do like the fact that I can wash it under running water. It is so much easy to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;The battery do last fairly long but if you are not done and it runs out you can not use it plug (in case some dummy tries to immerse  it while plug…) Also, I wonder if the battery life is going to decay and then you can not even use it plugging it in…&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand I like how I can just go sit some where which good light to use it without having to worry about plugging it in.&lt;br /&gt;I do not think is faster than the one purchased 5 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the wheel they put to turn it on and off, some times I need to use my 2 hand to turn it on or off, just not fast enough (I was very used to the other switch.)&lt;br /&gt;I do like the light, my first one did not have a light but my second one did. I would still like it to have a light on both front and back though.&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new epilator and had no time to return it and get the old model one, so I just keep it. Bu,t I sure would have not expended  the extra money if I had know what I was getting.</li>
    <li> I love this little beautie highly recommended for anyone looking for a eplilator, dose a awesomely good job and so many bits come with it for face etc</li>
    <li> I just loved this epilator.  I used to have one old version of this which I really liked for over 10 years.  I now decided to get a new one.  The different heads makes it even more useful.  I also enjoyed that it is wireless.</li>
    <li> Very good deal over all.</li>
    <li> This epilator has some nice features - it&#x27;s easy to hold, the light is bright so you can see each hair and the massage head really cuts down on the pain. However, I do find myself having to repeatedly go over the same area as the tweezers seem to miss a lot. Also, this product claims to be able to grip a hair the size of a grain of sand - in my experience that is absolutely not true. As previously stated, it consistently misses hairs much longer than a grain of sand. Overall, I would say this epilator is okay, but honestly if I had a to-do I would buy a different one.</li>
    <li> I did some research to determine which epilator was the best for what I wanted to do with it and while expensive, I feel the Braun SE7 is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Today was my first time ever using an epilator and it was great! I did legs and bikini line dry, not in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left leg:&lt;br /&gt;-I just used the epilator with the efficiency head, did not use the included Pre-Epilation towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;-It took me a bit to get the speed and direction down to get the best results. Don&#x27;t push too hard, that is counter productive.&lt;br /&gt;-felt like tiny pinpricks or a bunch of static shocks all at once but really not terrible&lt;br /&gt;-mild irritation visible but it went away within the hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right Leg&lt;br /&gt;-I tried the towelettes and efficiency head, didn&#x27;t notice any sensation difference, they smell nice though.&lt;br /&gt;-switched to the massaging head and really felt a difference. It tricks you into not feeling the pain as much. I like the massaging head best. It definitely decreased the unpleasantness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini line&lt;br /&gt;-overall unplesant, longer hairs are no good, trim those things with the shaving head beforehand!&lt;br /&gt;-again the massaging head was more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;-a few blood spots but way less than waxing would produce&lt;br /&gt;-silky smooth results, 100% better than shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a little bag to carry all the heads and accessories. Great product, why I went so many years not knowing this existed is a mystery. You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d be more prevalant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried underarms yet, will update when I do</li>
    <li> The  Braun Se7681 Silk-Epil 7681 Wet and Dry Epilator is a convenient tool to have in your arsenal for your war on stray hairs! It plucks even very short hairs, leaving behind smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator has a light, which makes it easier to view the areas you&#x27;re working on, and a wet/dry feature as well.  I did find that the epilator works better when dry, but it feels better when used wet, so it is nice to have the option to use it both ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various caps for the epilator increase its usefulness tremendously.  I especially like that it also functions as a shaver, because, lets face it, even if it does come with a special attachment for the job, pulling hair in \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot; is not that fun.</li>
    <li> Using this Braun Silk-Epil was my first time using an epilator.  I was not exactly sure what to expect but was excited by all of the other reviews I read where people talked about not having to use it that often to maintain hairless legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it on my legs, it was very painful and it left my legs with red dots wherever a hair was removed.  Those red dots stuck around for about a day.  The more I have used it over the last month though, the less irritated my skin is after use (I may get a little redness but it goes away within hours) and it is less painful too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that you can use it dry and that is my preference because it means I do not have to fit it into my normal shower time (I have two young kids so sometimes I don&#x27;t have the luxury of long showers!)  I also am a big fan of the light on it... even in a well lit room, it helps show you where hairs are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives would be how painful it is on other body parts.  I tried this epilator on my armpits and could not handle the pain (or the burning that lasted for days afterwards).  I will stick to a razor for that!  Also, I read reviews that said you only need to use it every couple of weeks but I find myself using it every couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am impressed with the product and enjoy using it for hair removal on my legs.</li>
    <li> This is the best epilator ever, it is incredibly versatile. The different attachments are perfect for whatever part of your body you need to keep smooth and hairless. This is the second epilator I own, the first was a Remington. And so far this one is my favorite. It is very efficient, and it is not as loud as the other one I had. Would totally recomend this.</li>
    <li> This epilator is the 5th one I&#x27;ve owned.  Yes, it&#x27;s spendy, but it&#x27;s also the first epilator that was able to grab the pale blonde super fine hairs on my legs (using the Express Head).  It hurts, like someone snapping a rubber band against my skin, but hey, it gets those fine hairs!  I mostly use epilators on my underarm hair though... if I shave there those hairs grow back stubbly and irritate my sensitive underarm skin.  If instead I epilate there, then the hairs grow back very fine and not itchy.  This epilator does a great job on my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only epilate dry, but being able to rinse this epilator under water to clean it is VERY nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to epilators, I would suggest shaving, then using the epilator.  This way you&#x27;ll grab only the few hairs you missed which will make it much more tolerable.  Then the next day, epilate again.  And so forth.  It&#x27;ll take a week to get them all but I think it&#x27;s the best way to ease into it as it hurts less with shorter hairs.  Doing all the hair at once can be too much to bear unless you&#x27;ve got crazy pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE*  It&#x27;s best to always use an epilator on clean skin only.  No lotion, no body oil!  The lotion or oil will get on those epilator grabbers and they&#x27;re not able to grab hairs as well any more.</li>
    <li> I really love mine, use it daily, works great!</li>
    <li> I am relatively new to epilating. I originally bought an emjoicorded model. After about 10 months the cord started malfunctioning, and their customer service totally blew me off with a replacement even though I was still within the 1 year warranty period. Not having any other experience with epilating, I was content with the emjoi even though it initially hurt and gave me a terrible rash on my legs. I stuck with it, and it was fine after a while. Fine as in no rash and no pain, well not much pain.&lt;br /&gt; After my customer service issue with emjoi, I decided to try the Braun based on other reviews, and it is definitely much better in most ways. It does a much better job of getting ALL the hair in one pass. The emjoi left a lot behind even though it had more tweezers. I also really find the light to be a useful feature that the emjoi was lacking. I am also impressed with the power. The reason that I bought the emjoi initially is that I thought a cordless model would be less powerful, but so far so good. The only negative in comparing the two is that I find the Braun to be more painful. I am hoping that I will get used to it after a few more uses. Ive been using it once a week for around 3 weeks now I think. I had the emjoi for 11 months or so.</li>
    <li> This is a great epilator, it keeps a charge for a long period of time, can go in the water which helps alleviate some of the pain associated with sensitive areas and it comes with multiple caps that are good for small and large areas. It has a light on it which helps to see any hairs that were missed and it fits nicely in my hand and glides nicely over the skin.</li>
    <li> The first one always hurts like hell, but I got use to it and it is so much better than waxing and shaving!</li>
    <li> absolutely loved it and am buying another for my daughter - absolutely no pulling - this really works - you gotta get one!</li>
    <li> Although it does hurt, which is expected for never epilating before, it works great! U only wax a couple times a year so I wasn&#x27;t used to any pain on my legs or underarms. So if you&#x27;re like me, this will need some getting used to. And there are some times when it can break a hair, but that happens with all epilators, and after it usually plucks it right out. This product is GREAT and I recommend it to anyone! And it really does hold a charge. The epilator heads are worth it for the extra money. They really help sensitive skin with pain.</li>
    <li> Love it, very simple and comfortable to use. For me theres no much pain using it. I recommend this a lot</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it advertises.  Lasts about an hour before it needs to be charged. I really like the built-in light on it; it really comes in handy while epilating.  I prefer to use it dry rather than wet; especially because I don&#x27;t want to take any chances with shortening the lifespan of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES it is painful, but you do build up your pain tolerance and it is super nice that it lasts so much longer than shaving.  You definitely need to exfoliate your skin, otherwise you will get ingrown hairs (especially on the legs).  I would recommend dry brushing and doing a body scrub :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it best for the underarms honestly. It is painful (of course) but you get used to it and it lasts a long time (relative to your hair growth cycle).  When you shave you very quickly have the dark colouration that comes from regrowth of the hair.  When you epilate, the entire hair is removed by the root and so you don&#x27;t have that dark colouration of your armpits until the entire new hairs start to grow in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, I do like this product.  It lasts longer than shaving and teaches you to just suck up the pain.  All of the little attachments are great, but I usually just use the &amp;#34;vibrating&amp;#34; one on.</li>
    <li> Not real sure about this product right now!  I do hope it works out for me.  Tried to get help on instructions but the young lady had to put me on hold twice and she didn&#x27;t seem to be real knowledgeable, but she was trying to help me!😊</li>
    <li> I love it, it works really great. But i wish it doesnt hurt. I know an epilator will hurt obviously. It works great on the armpits and legs.</li>
    <li> Such a great product. Have used it everywhere. Takes care of all the minuscule hairs and is even waterproof. The pain is not so bad and the roller helps desensitize the body. With each time you use it, it grows back thinner and smoother so epilating it keeps getting easier. This product rocks.</li>
    <li> First epilator and absolutely love it! A bit painful at first but thats a given with epilation. Now im actually finding myself missing the pinching sensation after a few days as crazy as that sounds lol. Did my underarms the night it came in the mail so I have hard time understanding the women who are unable to take the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; especially the ones claiming they have given birth but this is too difficult. GREAT results and the epilator itself is ammmmazing quality. Awesome attachments, looking forward to trying them out. Ideally would love for this model to be corded since I only use it dry, but for now have no complains about the length of charge. Got it on ebay for only $73!!!</li>
    <li> I liked it..it comes with 5 different  adjustment frames.. But not much usefull..rest is good&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend others :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an older model of Brauns epilator that has lasted my well over 6 yrs. It still works but i needed a cordless one to use in the shower. Works like a charm. Has a built in light that lets you see into darker zones. Holds charge well. Comes with several attachments but i find the only ones I most use is the razor attachment along with the standard epilator attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun has solid products that last.</li>
    <li> I felt like it CUT my hairs and did not remove them from the root when I was using it in the shower.  I think I will have to return it...</li>
    <li> I had an older style braun that I have used for years and upgraded after a friend ordered this one.  I have to say that I really love the new one.  The attachments are well thought out and do exactly what they are designed to do.  The main attachment for the legs doesn&#x27;t seem to feel like it is pulling as much as the older model does, but actually does a better job. The pivoting attachment goes around your knees which was always a problem before.  Also my older one was not cordless so you were tied to an outlet. This one is cordless and works in the shower too, although I always use it after the shower when your hairs are better suited for removal. The underarm attachment is great.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I bought this epilator!  I had never used an epilator before and was unsure whether I should spend $100 on my first one.  I decided to go ahead and buy it since I could always return it if it did not work out for me.  The epilator is cute.  It has a white glittery part that you can&#x27;t really see from the pictures.  I really like that it has a light because it makes it so much easier to see all the hairs.  It came with about four different covers: a normal one, the one with the rollers, one for sensitive areas, and one for use on the face.  I think the one with the rollers really does help to reduce pain (although, I did not feel pain when using the other attachments either).  My sister and I both tried it and neither of us felt pain.  It came with cooling wipes to soothe the skin afterwards, but I have not even opened the packet because I just don&#x27;t have a need for it.  It also came with a shaver head and a small brush for cleaning.  It is very easy to use and clean.  It&#x27;s small and fits in my hand comfortably.  I can use it on my entire legs and arms with just one charge.  You can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging, it can only be used cordless.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing at the beginning of 2013, and it&#x27;s still kickin. worth every penny to me. my hair grows back really fast, and i was sick to death of shaving my armpits every day, and my leg hair i gave up on. I started waxing in high school so the pain didn&#x27;t bother me. once you get used to it, it feels kinda good. and i went from having to shave everyday to using this once a week.&lt;br /&gt;some nice things about it, even though it hasn&#x27;t slowed the growth of my hair, it is much softer and lighter, so it&#x27;s not nearly as noticible as it used to be</li>
    <li> I am not sure how to rate this actually.  It was my first ever epilator purchase after researching the best product.  I bought it for all over epilating.  It comes beautifully packaged with great instructions.  I tried it on my underarms first with the appropriate attachment. OUCH!!! Will NEVER do that again!!!  I then tried it on my chin with the attachment because I have a lot of hairs there.  It stung at first, but however, it does pull the hairs out quite crisply and my chin is SMOOTH!  I love that part of it. The one thing that is not clarified is that the epilator may have issues with grey hairs since they are so course.  I had to use my tweezers on a few stray greys that the epilator could not grasp.  However, my chin remained hairless for about 4 days after my first use. It got easier on my chin with the epilator.  I am too scared to use it on my upper lip.  I tried my legs and I could only do one strip before I gave up and used my old standby razor.  It was just too painful!  I won&#x27;t give up though because this thing is expensive and I have to get my money&#x27;s worth.  I did notice that the one strip on my leg stayed hairless for a few more days than my usual shaving so I will continue to try to get my whole leg.</li>
    <li> Love this epilator. I purchased this one to replace a previous model. I only use it dry, my preferred method. If your new to epilating, I would suggest getting those Veet wax strips and waxing first. Then when your hair starts to come back in, use the epilator. It&#x27;s less painful as you won&#x27;t have as much hair to epilate. Then continue epilating as needed. I epilate about once every two weeks. Hate shaving and having those prickly legs by the end of the night. Love long lasting smooth legs!</li>
    <li> Works OK, but terribly painful, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> After waxing for many years, this is quick, convenient great for travel.</li>
    <li> I have to go over my legs more than a few times and the all the hairs still do not get removed.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it the first time she used it. Totally different than her old electric shaver. She can use it with or without the power cord.</li>
    <li> I received this product free to try from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review of the product. I used it to grrom my personal areas and enjoyed the trimmer feature as well as the buzzer for a nice close shave. This product is very stylish for the girl in me and super convenient to use in the shower, on vacation or practically anywhere else. It&#x27;s cordless and without a full charge lasted two full shaving times. I also used the epilator attachment and was expecting to be in pain. If you use the fastest mode(there are 2 modes) it really is so efficient and just about painless. It was nice to use it wet or dry as well because I enjoy shaving in the shower. However it&#x27;s super convenient to be able to sit on the couch and remove the hair from my legs!! Would recommend this product to anyone looking to remove body hair.</li>
    <li> I bought my first epilator over 20 years ago and I finally had to replace it. It still works, but it heats up pretty bad when I do more than my legs. I decided to get the SE7681 so I can use it in the shower. So far I love the fact that it works wireless and I really like all the attachments. I do my upper lip, under arm and legs, and have use all the attachments. I love it, my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get it sooner. Hopefully this one will last for the next 20 years.</li>
    <li> No more salon for upper lips.</li>
    <li> Will not remove every single hair  completely I can still feel the ones that were left behind  however, it does the job of removing most hair giving a more clean look. I would. Imagine the product to be better for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Good product as is required&lt;br /&gt;But I wish I was a little low price.&lt;br /&gt;And also suggested that the facility is sold with this product because of a topical anesthetic cream to use for people for the first time is painful, especially for young girls who have been the first to use them,</li>
    <li> I had an old Epilady that I really liked after getting use to it.  The Braun is still new to me but, so far, I&#x27;m loving it.  Thus far, I&#x27;ve only used it dry and probably always will.  I like that I can use it and watch TV.  I also love all the attachments that come with it.  There is an attachment for every need.  I clean it after each use and find that cleaning it is so easy.  I probably would have rated this a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve only had it about 2 months now.</li>
    <li> returning it!!! claims to work on a grain of sand length hair...IT DOESN&#x27;T!!!  I have thick black hair and it grows at weird angles and can be seen before felt and I hoped this would be my cure...Boy was I wrong and very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Does not epilate well, seems to only break off hairs. Hair is fully grown back after 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for the wife, and she loves it, it works perfect for her since she is used to Braun hair removal products and this one is even better since it has wet/dry option</li>
    <li> Love it. I can&#x27;t live without this Silk epil. Perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting used to. But after the first time(which is when it hurts the most) it gets better. The hair doesnt grow back for atleast a week. And if I keep up and use it frequently it doesnt pain as much. Battery power is also pretty good and covers use over hands, legs and underarms.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the overall quality and value.  It does what I expected it to do.  As in anything, it takes time to get to where you want to be with it.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! Works amazingly well on legs! SO MUCH quicker and less messier than waxing and who has time to go for waxing appointments. Just buy this and use it!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I always bought Braun, and I think that this one is really good however not as good as the older versions in picking up the smaller hairs. Also it is not as durable as the older versions which lasted forever for me.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re considering buying this just buy it. It means you&#x27;re sick of shaving, waxing, being hairy or whatever. Does it hurt? Dear God yes. Is it worth it? You betcha. I typically would shave my legs every other day and my arm pits daily. Now I epilate my legs once a week and my arm pits every 5 or 6 days. The hair has started to grow back thinner which is really nice. They include an attachment that massages as it rips the hair out. That&#x27;s nice but eventually you get kind of used to the pain and won&#x27;t use it as much. I love and hate this thing but I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. It&#x27;s saved me tons of time during the week when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
    <li> i use this all the time...after the initial pain it becomes so much easier to use....i love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a waxer for some time now so getting my legs completed was not an issue as my hair is used to being ripped out on a fairly regular basis.  However, no matter how many waxings have been completed, doing my own Brazilian was a case of masochism at it&#x27;s finest.  I&#x27;m pretty sure half way through my hairs were jumping out of my body just so they didn&#x27;t end up ripped out.  There were a few choice words, some deep breathing and some guided meditation but I got it done and I have to say the results are pretty phenomenal.  I&#x27;ve used epilators off and on for many years and this one is amazing.  The extra heads are perfect for what they&#x27;re there for.  I&#x27;m considering my armpits sometime in the future, but don&#x27;t know if my pain threshold would warrant it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE ***&lt;br /&gt;I use this about twice a month, maybe a little bit more and I have been using it regularly since I&#x27;ve gotten it.  Now the battery life is next to nothing and it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as good as it did when I first got it, which means I have to spend much more time using it, which means less and less gets done each time.  I would not recommend this as it&#x27;s too expensive for how short of a life span it has.  It still gets the job done after lots of work but I dread using it now knowing how much work it will actually be.</li>
    <li> Quality was terrible. Even it was broken when I received</li>
    <li> This works great, except for the hairs it doesn&#x27;t want to work on. I love it for arms, legs, etc. But it is STUBBORN on any kind of thicker hair for me.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for like 2 years now almost every other week, works just fine . Great product!</li>
    <li> This has been a leg saver, my legs have always been so sensitive and I always got terrible razor burn on my lower legs. This has made my legs look a thousand times better! I do not feel self conscious in shorts anymore, and I don&#x27;t have to shave my legs everyday which is a huge plus in my book. My hair does not seem to grow as fast anymore either. I only use it for my legs so I don&#x27;t have any tips if you are using it anywhere else, but I would definitely recommend exfoliating once or twice a week to avoid ingrown hairs which will happen more frequently with using an epilator and waxing. Also make sure you keep your legs moisturized so that it does not aggravate your skin too badly. I am really happy with this purchase and I only wish I would have bought one sooner!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my underarms, arms, and legs. I use this product about once a month. This product is serious life changing! Shaving has always made my hair grow back thicker, and I hate having to shave everyday.  Although this is a little painful, I still prefer it over anything else. This removes the hair from the root, so hair grows back slower and finer. The special light it has built in is also very useful to catch my small hairs. This also leaves my body SO smooth. It feels like no hair was every there. I seriously cannot say enough good things about this product!! This is a great epilator!! It came with a pack with olay wipes to use before and after epilation. Also, I&#x27;ve only charged the battery once for 15 minutes and it&#x27;s still running perfectly 3 years later!!</li>
    <li> I had another kind from 5 years ago but just started using it a few months ago. (won&#x27;t mention the brand, just that it is a popular one) but it was making me crazy. I had to go over and over the areas again and again, and often still could not get the hair. After looking into the ratings I purchased this one and after one use tossed the other in the trash.This one rocks!!</li>
    <li> The epilator didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;remove&amp;#34; hair from the roots, it just cut its off like any razor does, it picks out very very few hair. This just does not remover hair. Save your money! This product is not worth thr price!</li>
    <li> Breaks off more hair than it pulls out, but a good option for hair removal.</li>
    <li> It is brilliant.But sometimes,it pulls my skin.</li>
    <li> I like this brand . It works for me.</li>
    <li> I am unhappy. it only held the charge for 30 minutes. I think I got a lemon.&lt;br /&gt;Now it only holds a charge for 15minutes. I think I will buy some other brand!</li>
    <li> this thing is so scary to use. the first time i epilated my bikini line it literally took me over a week. its super painful at first but once you get used to it, its the best thing ever.</li>
    <li> I bought an epilator years ago and hated it.  I mistakenly thought that the technology had improved.  It misses lots of hair so you have to keep going over and over the same area and it hurts.</li>
    <li> Very good product, works well and battery life has been lasting a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast, especially considering I was ordering from and getting the product delivered to the UK.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend investing in this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second Silk-epil because my sister came to visit and loved my first one so much she took it!  This one is the next generation and is even better.  I love that I can use it right out of the shower.  As with any of the other epilators I have owned, it&#x27;s great for fine to medium hair, but for the most part, all it does to very course hair (ie armpit and thick pubic hair) is pull on it (ouch!), so I still have those parts waxed.  I use this on everything else.  Tried the Emjoi once because I heard it was superior, but was definitely not the case (I gave it to my sister, which is probably why she swiped my Braun Silk-epil a few months later!).  The Emjoi simply didn&#x27;t remove the hair like the Braun.  Could have been an issue with my technique, but my sister agreed.</li>
    <li> Trust the bad reviews, this product didn&#x27;t suit me at all! I&#x27;m a first time epilator user and I purchased this after a lot of searching and quite disappointed. I have red bumps all over my legs after use, my skin is sensitive but nothing this bad happened before, i had use the pre condition towel as well to prep my skin.  The epilator didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;remove&amp;#34; hair from the roots, it just cut its off like any razor does, it picks out very very few hair. I tried several angles like reviews suggest, stretched my skin like the instruction says but nope i had to roll over some hair twice to get it picked out/cut. Pardon the hairy/messy leg picture but it shows the red bumps after use, it&#x27;s just so itchy and burning, what a painful way of shaving this turned out to be!</li>
    <li> I bought this for facial hair.  I am 40 and have issues with dark hair on my chin, upper lips and cheeks.  I am very fair.  I would first off say that this product works fairly well.  It takes care of my problems, though I have to use it every other day.  Not a big deal considering I was tweezing every day. It does leave my skin smooth and cuts down on my morning grooming time.  I will say it hurts, and still hurts after several months of use.  It hurts the worse on the upper lip, but it is only momentary and goes away quickly.  The pain is worth the results.  This does have problems pulling out course hair, but that is probably due to the fact that it is hard to pull the skin tight in some areas.  I give it 4 stars because of how frequently I have to use the product. Overall I see a HUGE improvement</li>
    <li> Initially, I was fairly happy with this epilator. However, after about two months of ownership the power switch in the unit failed and the device acquired a mind of it&#x27;s own. If it had a charge, it could turn itself on at any time, and when it did, it would be impossible to shut off. I contacted Braun about the issue, I will have to mail the unit to a repair center at my expense and the turnaround time will likely be several weeks. I&#x27;m not impressed, and I regret making this purchase.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;It can be used wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;A light turns on when you power it on so it lights the spot you are epilating (very helpful).&lt;br /&gt;Plucks thick long hairs easily.&lt;br /&gt;The hairs do not grow back as fast (but when they do, it&#x27;s still stubble feeling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little loud.&lt;br /&gt;Claims to pluck the shortest of hairs but not 100% true.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pluck baby hairs too well.&lt;br /&gt;You have to go over same spot numerous times.&lt;br /&gt;Effective on bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t feel silky smooth like when you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall glad I purchased it and will continue to use it when I have an hour to spend on epilating.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time, it is super good. It removes even the shortest hairs. The first time it feels like your skin is burning, but from the on the pain diminishes. Hairs don&#x27;t grow until after 4 or more weeks, and when they start growing they are usually more fine and in less quantity</li>
    <li> Granted, this item is based for women, I am a male but wanted to try an Epilator for the first time.  I chose this one based on reviews, Braun quality, and features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quick review is it works.  It is very powerful.  Love the fact it&#x27;s rechargeable and long lasting.  Also it can be used in the shower as it&#x27;s waterproof.  Has lots of attachments to trim or shave just about anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad...  Yeah, it hurts if it&#x27;s your first time using an Epilator.  You&#x27;ll find different parts of the body are more sensitive than others.  It does get better after each use I hear.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to confirm this but will follow up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this will be a nice smooth body summer coming up!  That&#x27;s my goal.</li>
    <li> Was very unhappy with this after reading all the good reviews. It was taking forever to shave off all the hair on my legs and with that being said, it did not even remove it all. Not worth the pain that it causes while doing it.</li>
    <li> So nice not to be attached to a cable!  Love the illumination/light feature, really highlights new growth, plus the changeable heads.  Some difficulty to maneuver the dial to turn on, but I&#x27;m sure this will become easier with use.  I&#x27;ve been a Silk Epil fan for many years and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
    <li> Great unit, hope it lasts the 15 years the last Braun we had did.  The only thing negative, and it is definitely not a showstopper, is that the accessories are not labeled, so you have to check the instructions (which are a bit jumbled) to figure out what is for what.  The cut path for the sensitive skin accessory is small too, I wish it was wider.  A great product as a whole.</li>
    <li> First use-&lt;br /&gt;Product does hurt. Left my legs feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Week after use-&lt;br /&gt;Noticed hair growing under my skin.....had to take a sewing pin and flick them out.&lt;br /&gt;Vowed to exfoiliate and mosturize everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Months after use-&lt;br /&gt;I have had to use the epilator once a week. Doesnt hurt anymore. Hair grows back finer, no more dark leg pores and stubble that grows back isn&#x27;t uncomfortable. But I still have ingrown hairs that need to be flicked out of the skin.....exfoliating and mosturizing didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am prone to ingrown hairs....but I still love this little device.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything in the past.  My Italian heritage leaves me with dark hair that always returned by a day of two at the most.  I used this Epilator nine days ago (yes NINE) under my arms and I&#x27;m still waiting for stubble to return, so I can use it again.  It&#x27;s almost unbelievable how well it worked.  I&#x27;m so happy.  I have to admit it was scary and painful, and I thought someone had replaced the twizzers with razors that were now shredding my underarms.  But, I grabbed my spine and tried again and it worked wonders.  I did one underarm dry, then the second in the shower.  I think they were both fine, but I&#x27;ll use the shower from now on.  BUY this!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Is a good product but it was too expensive and did not work the way i was expecting it to work :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun Silk Epil for years on my legs, but could never use it under my arms because it was so painful. I had to shave, and I hate shaving. When I got this new model, I tried it again, and success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still going to be painful as heck, so it&#x27;s important to approach it the right way.&lt;br /&gt;1. Shave the day before. Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did and think the hair needs to be longer. That&#x27;s how I ended up with an epilator dangling from my armpit.&lt;br /&gt;2. Epilate in the shower, with your arm stretched behind your head and the water hitting your armpit. This reduces the pain from &amp;#34;I&#x27;M BEING FLAYED ALIVE&amp;#34; levels to &amp;#34;Ow ow ow!&amp;#34; levels.&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t do it all at once. It&#x27;s going to HURT A LOT at first, and you might even bleed a tiny bit, so do small sessions every day to keep from being overwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;4. Epilate often. Once you&#x27;ve gotten rid of the hair, you can just do five second touch ups in the shower to catch hairs as they grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take heart! Once you&#x27;re in the maintenance phase, it barely hurts at all, and that&#x27;s what makes it so great. I love that I can spend a total of five minutes a month on my underarms and have zero stubble. I also find this model is better at catching tiny hairs on my legs, and the light is very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I&#x27;d change:&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was an easy way to clean the epilator head; I have long hair and stray hairs get hopelessly wrapped around it.&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t use the epilator while it&#x27;s charging. I guess this is to discourage people from bringing the epilator into the shower while it&#x27;s plugged in, but come on, is anyone that silly? The battery doesn&#x27;t last much more than 20 minutes on high, and that&#x27;s not enough when I&#x27;m weedwhacking legs I neglected over the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate shaving and stubble, I&#x27;m too blonde for lasers, and waxing doesn&#x27;t last me more than a week. Unfortunately I&#x27;m not self-confident enough to go around with hairy legs and underarms, so this epilator has made my life much, much easier.s and underarms, so this epilator has made my life much, much easier.</li>
    <li> I like this Silkepil machines , its very good quality worth paying for , better than shaving, hair grow slower and more softer</li>
    <li> Epilators by BRAUN are really the best out there. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 15 years on my legs, and they do an amazing job. This one is probably my 5th Braun epilator since I started using them so you know they last for a while. German quality still means a lot I guess.</li>
    <li> HAD to review, given my first use. I will only be using this for my issue, hair on face that has developed with menopause. I&#x27;m not that hairy, but had enough I felt like old fart with this hair. Esp. the black ones...ick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it hurts about or less than professional waxing. But my professional is leaving town and though I live in Chicago, I thought $20 an appointment (in 6 appointments I&#x27;d save money). I&#x27;d tried DIY waxing, with hard wax. Messy, incomplete. And yes, I spilled a couple of tablespoons on a dress once. Still is on it. I tried a twirly thing that worked, but was, well slow and painful. Enough so I&#x27;d avoid using. I tried tweezers. You have to be kidding. One hair at a time? Talk about my attention span waning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So did due diligence, reviewing a well-known brand that is advertised on my favorite liberal radio show and others. Poor reviews. Looked at others. Articles online, etc. Due to reviews and comments made, I went with this pricier option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy am I glad I did. First use, was no more and maybe less painful than PROFESSIONAL waxing. And it worked! Got those nasty hairs I hate. I can easily do this weekly. You can too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The husband wants me to do his back (will consider).</li>
    <li> For an electric razor it trims hair well. Gives a close enough job that you would expect from an electric. Comes with a few attachments that are for different lengths. Has two speed settings and there is a light if you want to shave in the dark, lol. Not sure why you would though. The light is bright and works extremely well. Holds a charge for a very long time. You can go a month and it will still operate as if it had been charged the other day. Has a nice look and feel. Washing anc cleaning the device is fairly simple too. Power/charge cord could be a longer but I&#x27;m not complaining. Overall decent electric razor that will provide a decently close shave even on longer hair.</li>
    <li> i received the item within less than two days. i could not believe my eyes. i like you amazone, you never let me down![[ASIN:B004TL9A7U Braun 7681 Silk-Epil 7 Xpressive Pro Epilator]]&lt;br /&gt;good luck</li>
    <li> This worked much better than I expected and much better than the old one. Legs stay smoother for at least a week!</li>
    <li> I had previously used the Silk Epil 5 and stopped using it because it was too painful. I once again tired of shaving, and decided to try this one since it could be used in water. I&#x27;m glad, because the ability to use it in water makes a HUGE difference. Hot water relaxes your skin and lets the hair pull out much easier. Keep in mind that I&#x27;m a guy and have a LOT of thick hair on my legs, probably more than most of the people interested in this product. There is a huge difference in the amount of pain compared to the Silk Epil 5, which could only be used on dry skin. I ran a bath tonight and sat with my legs submerged while using the machine, and it took me about 15 minutes to do both legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this without getting ingrown hairs, you HAVE to exfoliate. I use a pumice stone, and immediately after epilation, use an anti-microbial soap (Dial for example) to prevent staph infections of the hair follicles. Staph is all over your skin, and given the opportunity, will infect your hair follicles and cause something similar to razor bumps, though razor bumps are often cause by sharp hair pressing into the side of the follicle as well as staph. So I scrub my skin with Dial and the pumice stone so the exfoliation action lets the soap reach a little further into the follicle where it can kill any microbial agents. After waiting for a minute or two without washing of the soap, I rinse and use a moisturizing body wash to replace some of the moisture drawn out by the soap. It keeps me from having problems when the hair grows back. It also helps to have about 3-5 days of growth so the tweezers actually have something to grasp, which also helps to minimize the amount of hair that gets broken rather than pulled. The result is, minus a few stragglers, perfectly smooth legs for about two weeks (depending on how fast your hair grows of course). When the hair is long enough to start showing again, it looks like the growth is thinner, but it&#x27;s really just that your hair is regrowing with a tapered point as it naturally does and not a sharp, thick end that shaving causes, so even regrowth feels smoother than it does when you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can handle a little pain, buy this, because it will save you loads of time and money that would have been spent on razors and cream. I epilate once every week and a half or two, where I was shaving at least every other day.</li>
    <li> im in love with this! ..the first few times i tried to use it id turn it on and get scared and turn it back off..but then i finally decided to stop being so scared of it...i did the front of my lower right leg, and it surprisingly didn&#x27;t hurt, until i got to the back part and i had to stop..but the next day i figured id give it another try, it hurt but i kept going...when i did my left lower leg i realized i was just whizzing right through it...it wasn&#x27;t hurting or anything..and my legs were silky smooth...its been a few days now and i feel the hair starting to grow back out but the manual says for the first month to use it once a wk...so thats what I&#x27;m going to do...i also tried it on other part of my body (actually a little everywhere except my face) and i have to say...it hurts least on the legs below the knee....but I&#x27;m going to keep using it everyday or every other day on different parts of my body until i become fully comfortable with it,..because although its a pain, the results are beautiful and amazing!!! ..definitely 5 stars and more :D As for the battery life....i don&#x27;t find it tooo big of an issue...</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s almost painfree.</li>
    <li> works fine but my hair is still growing faster then i want it to i need to use this every 2 3 weeks and not 6 like it said i would but i still like it</li>
    <li> I bought this specially for face, however I couldn&#x27;t find any reliable review stating how it works for face. So here it is. This device works perfect on face with the facial cap, Plucks hair from their roots. If there are minute hair, pluck them with tweezer before running this unit on your face so you get all the hair out in one go. After using this on face, its feels little red, but hey this is tweezing so I am fine with it. Easy to clean as well. My only concern is its expensive rechargeable battery that I&#x27;ve heard is available from Germany for $40 dollars. And the Epilator does not work while you plug it into the charger. So being an electronics guy, I will have to open it up after its battery gives up charging, and see whats in there that I can change so it can run off the charger. Otherwise unit works as expected..</li>
    <li> After shaving for years, and then waxing for about a year, I planned a trip to Europe lasting three months, and didn&#x27;t want to have to find a new aesthetician to do my legs.  I had heard good things about this epilator, so decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been here in Europe for 2 1/2 months now, and have used this about every 4-5 days.  It&#x27;s GREAT!  Yes, of course, it doesn&#x27;t feel great to rip the hair out by the roots, but if you do it often (the more often, the better), it isn&#x27;t bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine blonde hair on my legs and it grabs them without a problem.  It gets the really short ones, too.  I am very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my upper lip (again, no waxing services here) and it works just as well.  No issues with abrasion or cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try it anywhere else...those had to go back to the razor.  ;)</li>
    <li> Is a easy and good machine</li>
    <li> Bought it last summer and love it. The shaver/trimmer and light is great.</li>
    <li> I have used various hair removing applications and this is by far less painful. It doesn&#x27;t catch every hair the first time, but which one does? One thing I&#x27;m not overly impressed about is that the battery runs low fairly quickly just after being charged - I had it on for less than 10 minutes and the red light was blinking, and it cannot be used with the charger, so that&#x27;s not good. I do, however, like the fact that it takes around 2 weeks before I need to epilate again.</li>
    <li> Its an open box, missing head cover.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my wife, complete product she says, battery lasts a long time, does everything she would have hoped for.</li>
    <li> My first time trying an epilator, and this did not hurt as much as I thought it would. I like that it comes with a couple of different caps. Some of the caps help with more sensitive areas. The option of 2 speeds is good for sensitive areas too. It seems that some of my hairs grow back sooner than would be expected from getting pulled out from the root. I think the epilator sometimes just rips out hairs without the root, so the result is almost like shaving. Still, I think less grows back, and the growth is slower. If you&#x27;re used to waxing, this is not so bad. Razors make your legs smoother though, since the epilator cannot get the super short, micro hairs. The epilator will get rid of 99% of the visible hairs, but if you run your hand over the skin, you can still feel tiny hairs there. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have found this product 25 years ago!  Works as well or better than advertised.  It has revolutionized my routine!</li>
    <li> My sister recommended it as a better solution vs. waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have used epilators but were really painful.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one with low expectations. It works! In the legs is not painful at all, it works better dry than wet. I will give it an eight</li>
    <li> My last Braun epilator lasted over 10 years and worked well until it died (even then it was just one of the heads that wore out). Very high quality products. This was a great investment.</li>
    <li> It is a great product with great features for shortest hair removal on body. I really liked it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I primarily wanted something that would remove hair nicely before attempting laser hair removal in my armpit area so I purchased this product. It definitely takes time to get used, and have not yet used it on my armpits. I think it works well for legs, and arm hair. When it comes to the face, it&#x27;s fair. The epilator takes time getting used to for those who haven&#x27;t used it before. And if you&#x27;re like me, a tough tomboy who is still progressing to learn about female grooming, this review is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Be very gentle as in VERY GENTLE when you bring the epilator to your skin. When I first tried it to my armpits, I immediately aimed for myself thinking I was being careful enough, and the device pulled in my skin! I was like, &amp;#34;DAMNNNNNN, this shit hurts!&amp;#34; I still haven&#x27;t gotten used to it for my armpits. The motion of a device plucking hairs out of your body is sharp. If you&#x27;ve ever used tweezers for your armpits, it&#x27;s that feeling times 10.&lt;br /&gt;- I spent a lot of money on the thing, so I was planning on returning it. But before I did, I thought I give it another shot; only this time not in my armpit area.&lt;br /&gt;- I used it for my arm hair, my legs, and my face. I still use tweezers to manually pluck for my eye brows. When I used the epilator on my face, I used it to pull out the hairs on each side of my face that were growing out like side burns. It hurt, but definitely no big deal compared to armpit area. I liked that it came with a precision top to help epilate narrow areas of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Gently &amp;#34;Gliding&amp;#34; the epilator along your arm works great. Now I went on youtube to see how this works, and I saw women who were so used to the epilator make it look easy. But if you&#x27;re a beginner I know this will happen at least once, If you carelessly or think you&#x27;re being careful enough at how you TILT or AIM the epilator at your skin then think again before contact. You can actually get your skin caught in the motor of blades and get pinched. Now I&#x27;m warning you of this because I was unaware such a device could do such a thing thinking, &amp;#34;this should be easy&amp;#34;. Since I consider myself to be tough, the pinching was not as bad as not knowing it could happen. Not knowing, along with the pinching, can be quite startling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My legs don&#x27;t grow out too hairy or too thick although I shave. So using the epilator for them is kind of annoying when shaving is a lot faster and quieter. Of course the purpose of the epilator is to remove hair from it&#x27;s root so it doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast. So that&#x27;s nice, but again I&#x27;m a bit of a tomboy, so even if I do have hairy legs, I don&#x27;t worry about it. From far away, people can&#x27;t see the hair! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-After bypassing how you control your epilator, it then becomes &amp;#34;easy to use&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still haven&#x27;t aimed for armpits, yet. And it will take some time before I attempt laser surgery. For now, shaving the armpit area with a nice minty foam is good enough, until I make my way using the epilator for that area again. Though, it&#x27;s almost crazy to think people put themselves through that type of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> Its giving me more in-growth. i.e. hair growth below the skin. Its not removing my upper lip  and chin hair completely.</li>
    <li> Pulls hair out as stated.</li>
    <li> Seems to break more hairs than my old one which means having to use it every few days</li>
    <li> I have used this twice so far, but I am going to give it a few more attempts before I can say for sure the outcome.</li>
    <li> My favorite epilator yet!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this after reading nearly all the reviews on this. I have used an epilator before but stopped for a few years and decided to get one again.&lt;br /&gt;After having had mine for about 2 weeks now and using it pretty much every 2nd or 3rd day, I have yet to achieve smooth legs. There&#x27;s always stubbles from broken hair or new growth (not going to fault the Braun for that, but the broken hair part?). You&#x27;d think after 2 weeks you&#x27;d pretty much have perfect legs just doing minor touch ups. Nope, not me.&lt;br /&gt;I also braced the pain and epilated my armpits which I&#x27;d never done before. I have soooo many ingrown hairs despite using a pumice stone and tree hut exfoliator twice a week. Am I missing something here? I thought the other reviews about ingrown hair must have not exfoliated right, and maybe they and I aren&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s not really rocket science.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this on my legs as they at least don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs, but will probably stop there. Could have gotten that for cheaper.</li>
    <li> I own an Emjoi and cannot believe this product has been rated as the best epilator. It takes forever to remove hair. Yes, it is nice that it has a built in light and you can use it in the shower, but who cares if the job cannot be done... A true disappointment. Going back to my Emjoi with 70 pulling points. Works like magic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked if this epilator is considered the best epilator. I have my old epilator Philipps, which I&#x27;ve been using 10 years and just decided to order something new, expecting that during 10 years something changed in this industry...and I am so desapointed, my old epilator works much better than this one, with Braun I have to epilate my legs forever and it can&#x27;t take the small hair but long hair it epilates forever. And why this epilator can&#x27;t be working while is charging??? Again...I have to wait forever to charge my epilator so I can epilate my legs forever....Bad...very bad!!!</li>
    <li> Have hairline a long way down my neck on either side and a very short hair cut. Shaving only lasted 3 days. So far, with minimal pain, the hair is still gone and it&#x27;s been 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews on Amazon before deciding on which Epilator to purchase. I settled on this one because I thought maybe being able to use it in water would help since I was aware that it was going to hurt the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie - the first time in each area really did hurt, especially the bikini area, but I worked at it a little at a time and now it&#x27;s no big deal. I look forward to how wonderful my skin feels when I&#x27;m done. No more goosebump razor stubble right after my showers either. Love that!&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that I prefer to use the epilatore dry, but I don&#x27;t regret the purchase of buying this particular model. I can do my legs, underarms, and bikini area on one charge. I try to epliate everything really well once every other week, and then the rest of the time I just do touch ups with a razor when I shower. My skin is smoother than it has ever been. I am careful to exfoliate in the shower every day to make sure not to get ingrown hairs. That&#x27;s very important.&lt;br /&gt;My advice - be brave - buy it.</li>
    <li> Good epilator that can be used in the shower, long lasting battery  and easy enough to manage.  I guess it takes some time to be use to the feeling but  I love the results</li>
    <li> Of course it hurts but not as much as I expected and my skin feels so soft not like before!&lt;br /&gt;also I just went over two times at the most and it pretty caught my hairs well&lt;br /&gt;bikini area hurts like a heck so I couldn&#x27;t continue but I might try while taking a shower.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of removing hair though I don&#x27;t feel like it gets all of the sand grain hairs like it&#x27;s advertised to do. I have had it grab my skin a few times which is painful but might be because I held it at two much of an angle. The different head attachments are great.</li>
    <li> Does as advertised. ...painful but aren&#x27;t they all.</li>
    <li> works very well . Good aspect is cordless and usability in shower as well.</li>
    <li> It works, but causes in grown hairs</li>
    <li> Good price&lt;br /&gt;Perfect machine</li>
    <li> I have epilated my hands, legs, underarms and upper lips. Works well!</li>
    <li> Painful but worth it! I would recommend easing into it. You most likely won&#x27;t be able to do an entire section of your body the first time you use it but it does get easier over time. The skin looks so much better and is smoother after a few sessions. I would also recommend using your epilator in the shower and getting a red bump/ingrown hair serum.  Don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate too. I used my epilator on dry skin and it was much more painful and my skin was very irritated. Your skin will be red at first so it&#x27;s best if you use it the night before.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for hair removal comfortably underwater</li>
    <li> Works great. Love all the additional attachments even clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Really wish it worked while plugged in.</li>
    <li> I love it! It does not hurt as much as I thought it would.  The charge last for a very long time</li>
    <li> Works great. You need high pain tolerance to use it</li>
    <li> I was dumb and started with my armpits. At least the legs were easy after that.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to trim the hairs down with the trimmer attachment before you use the epilator.</li>
    <li> got it for wife and she LOVES it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;she&#x27;s happy so am i, enough said!!!!</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;m using it, the epilator head will consistently become detached and clip my skin! When I try to use it on my underarms, it&#x27;ll invariably fall off and suck in some of my skin, pinching it - which let me tell you is really, really, really darn painful. It does better on my legs, because the skin is more taut, but I expect my $100 epilator to work everywhere. My old $30 Remington one never, ever pinched me or detached like that. I really regret buying this, since it was so darn expensive and I can only use it with bated breath, praying the attachment won&#x27;t come off. My prayers usually go unanswered. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s something wrong with my specific epilator, or if it&#x27;s the design. There&#x27;s a button you can press to detach it, and it&#x27;ll click in place when you re-attach it, but I guess that little &#x27;click&#x27; means absolutely nothing. The attachment must not be very strong or well-designed, because it&#x27;ll detach by itself all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only pro I would say this epilator has is the shaving and trimming heads - those are very useful and nice, but I bought this to be an epilator, not a razor/scissor combo!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Received it today ! I have used Braun epil ator as a teenager but when I came to USA it didnot work because of voltage issues! After 10 years I ordered this and must say its a huge improvement! I love it! I received it on time fortunately when I opened the box it was charged so I put it to immediate use and results were amazing ! Pleased with myself for ordering it after contemplating and reading reviews for about a year.the facial and underarm attachment are great. Read instructions carefully before starting to use.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far, but the results were great.</li>
    <li> it is the best machine ever, you should use it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 4 after I used my first for the rest of my family.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I bought this product because I was trying out a different product where you are supposed to epilate before you use it, and I didn&#x27;t like that product&#x27;s epilator attatchment.  I wanted to find a better one, so I did some research and purchased this epilator.  I have to say it is like night and day between this epilator and every other one I have ever tried!  I love that I can use it in the bath!  My skin loves this!  I have used an epilator on my legs, but with my legs wet, it makes a huge difference - there was no pain at all!  My tops of my feet are sensitive, but wet, no problem.  It comes with multiple heads, including underarm and upper lip, and so I tried the underarm head, which I have never tried before, since I tend to have sensitive skin - no pain there either!  Not only can I finally use an epilator on the areas I want, without pain, it also gets the fine hairs that others do not catch!  This pulls fine hairs, practically flush to my skin.  AND on top of that, the head rotates, so it is super easy to keep it flush, unlike other epilators.  There are two heads for your general wide area (legs) use, one with massagers and the other with grooves that lift the hairs.  I tried and liked both, but liked the massager head better - it lifts the hairs and provides some extra gentle skin surface stimulation.  Both of the large heads rotate.  It also comes with the underarm/bikini head, upper lip head, and a whole set of shaver attatchments which I did not use, since I bought it in order to epilate.  Oh, and it also has a light that turns on when you are running the unit, that lights up the area you are using it on, so you can see any hairs left and go over the area again.  This light shines on the area where you are epilating, NOT in your eyes.  Very helpful!  I am totally spoiled now, never going back to any other epilator.  I love this thing!  My skin is so smooooth!  Thank you so much, whoever invented it!  Oh, and the 40 minute charge was plenty of time for me to do my legs and underarms.</li>
    <li> I have tried creams and at home waxes and those have never worked for me. I&#x27;m one of those that had to shave every other day for continuous smooth legs. The first epilator I tried was the Phillips HP6401. I was expecting it to be painful so that wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me. I ended up having to return it because it would miss so much hair. I followed the directions meticulously and spent 2 hours trying to get the missed hairs to no avail. So when I read about the Braun Silk Epil 7 I was so excited and thought the other one was just cheap and that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work. But no exact same story with the Phillips. And the Phillips one is no more painful than the Braun so if you&#x27;re buying because you think it will be less painful dont. Your basically paying $75 more for the extra attachments, that to me makes no difference at all. I ended up returning it. I am gonna stick with my trusty Venus Swirl.</li>
    <li> My husband (African American) bought this in an attempt to find a cure for the ingrown hairs he would get from shaving every day.  He thought he would use this to epilate one a week or so and not have to shave in-between--giving his skin a chance to heal from the daily shaving that is required in the military.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there is a lady pictured on the cover, he decided he would let me test it out on my legs before he gave it a go.  It hurt like the dickens and I gave up after about 5 minutes.  Not only that, but I got ingrown hairs as a result on using it despite going in afterwards and exfoliating quite vigorously.  Granted, I didn&#x27;t try it long term, so perhaps it gets better with time, but I much prefer to not spend my nights crying while I epilate my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use on Face by Husband:&lt;br /&gt;After my husband saw me wincing in pain, he wrote it off as me being a pansy and decided to man up and take on the whiskers that covered his face and neck.  In a show of machismo, he got halfway through his face, gritting his teeth the entire way through, trying not to let the tears stream down his face as he grimaced with pain.  He never used it again, although he later shared that he had strongly considered getting drunk enough that he wouldn&#x27;t feel the pain of it, but was afraid that he would somehow rip off half of his face in his drunken state and then be all the more worse for the whole experience.  The only bright side was that hubby had zero ingrown hairs--which he normally has a plethora of as a result of his electric razors.  So now if he could only bare the pain, he could have that silky smooth skin he had always dreamed of.</li>
    <li> Worth the money, I had a previous epilator which was $50 and I&#x27;m glad I upgraded. This epilator pullest even the finest and shortest hairs.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews, and also looked at the blogs for the &amp;#34;No-No&amp;#34;.  After reading so many reviews for the &amp;#34;No-No&amp;#34; that tell you that it&#x27;s a giant rip off, I asked my daughter what she does and she told me to get the Silk-epil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read the reviews for the Silk-epil.  Point blank.  Yes, it does hurt somewhat the first time you use it, especially underarms.  BUT, it does what it says it&#x27;s going to; I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore and it is so much better than shaving.</li>
    <li> I love it! Its wireless, works very well and has different heads for different areas.&lt;br /&gt;Also the integrated light is really helpful!</li>
    <li> Simply, horrible. All the good reviews say that it doesn&#x27;t hurt and this is why they like it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt because it doesn&#x27;t pull hair out. It just cuts it off. It&#x27;s like getting a hair cut instead of eppilation. I&#x27;m a pro at this and i hate this unit. I don&#x27;t mind the pain as long as my legs get smooth. With this unit my legs nit smooth. After the eppilation, my legs have little hair left all over. They&#x27;ve been cut NOT pulled out. Paying so much i was hopping to get a good eppilator. I wouldn&#x27;t even want it free because there is no point in it.</li>
    <li> Grabs everything, easy to get used to, and hey, it&#x27;s less painful than laser and cheaper in the long run!  Lots of great attachments, even an electric razor with a guard that makes everything the perfect length to then turn around and epilate.  It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I love it. it removes even the tiniest and lightest hairs :D.It&#x27;s little bit painful, the first time but from second time on wards i didn&#x27;t feel much pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: The shorter your hair , the lesser the pain . (the trimmer which comes with the package , comes handy for this ).</li>
    <li> Works fairly well, and succeeds at pulling hair with great effectiveness and pain. At least for me. My fiancé, feels very little pain, because her hair is few and far between.&lt;br /&gt;Hair stays away for about 3 weeks for me and 4 weeks for her. And it does grow back a bit thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW- using this product feels NOTHING like a wax job. For me, I prefer the mass batch of pain from thousands of hairs being pulled to onesies and twosies at a time with this product.&lt;br /&gt;While the hair is being pulled, it feels like little bolts of lightning being shot through your leg. And does miss hair and doesn&#x27;t grab the short hairs like it claims.  And if you have knobby knees, you still have to shave them as it doesn&#x27;t do well with lumpy body parts.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this product is pretty nice and has lots of features.</li>
    <li> The gears on my ancient Emjoi burned out, so I had to return to shaving (which my skin hates!) and look for a replacement epilator. Hadn&#x27;t even realized how far the technology has come! This seemed to be the top-of-the line, so I figured I would try it. And it is SO much better, and I haven&#x27;t even tried it wet yet. Less pain in more sensitive areas (so less hesitation) and it seems to pick up more hair with every pass. Love that I can spend far less time getting the same results. And I have to admit, I like the pretty silvery sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still can&#x27;t imagine who could possibly ever use ANY epilator on their underarms though. Thought &amp;#34;well maybe it&#x27;s not as painful as I remembered when I tried with my brand new Emjoi?&amp;#34; Yeah, no. It&#x27;s worse than I remembered. OUCH! Good thing it&#x27;s also the one part of my body that doesn&#x27;t react to razors with angry redness and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> So loving this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all the reviewers out there. Really helped me choose this product out of the many out there.  The product is a Braun and that along carries weight in my book.  So easy to use, so many options in the kit, and just easy to set up. I used it for legs, underarms and upper lip.  Given my pain tolerance i decided to do my legs under flowing water and that really helped.  Within a minute of starting, my skin was tolerating it. Even short hair came off easy.  Then I tried the wet mode with my underarms and that was painful.  So I switched to dry mode with some Burts Bees Powder helping to dry out the region. and that worked so well! and then i got really brave and did my upper lip with the special attachment and again perfect in dry mode.  Just so happy. Its day 5 and no bristly shaving-induced-regrowth.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Easy to use wet or dry. Yes, painful at first, but bearable. Becoming less painful with each use. So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect! I have only used it a few times but seems to do very well.  I am well pleased!</li>
    <li> Amazing in use  and the most usefull part of product is shaver included in it. I recommend to buy this product</li>
    <li> not very effective and not as good as the emjoi epilator, which was a little disappointing given the price. probably would not purchase again</li>
    <li> Works great, not too painful of a method, I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to get one. Overall it is a lot more practical than other methods such as waxing and very efficient. Saves on time and removes hair very precisely while reducing re-growth of hair. But you need to make sure it is charged or else you will not be able to use it. I find it practical that you can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I hate it! had to get drunk 3 nights in a row to be able to handle the pain and finish my legs..... I love that the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for bit but all that grew back was like in grown and red and bumpy... looks like razor burn. gross. and hurt for days.  but I think that&#x27;s just my hair, my pores, because I have thick gross hair.  just doesn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was supposed to be great at removing facial hair.  It doesn&#x27;t remove any!  You just wear your skin off going over &amp; over the area &amp; it still does nothing.  I have tried both wet &amp; dry.  Very disappointing!  When I tried to return this, Amazon&#x27;s return time limit had been exceeded, so I am stuck with it &amp; extremely unhappy with Amazon!</li>
    <li> Expected as it is. I only thing is small string fell off when I first use the razor but still works. I do not user razor anyway so I don&#x27;t care. I charge over night for the first time and I have use it more than three hours and still not require to recharge it.</li>
    <li> First off, I have to say, that I am not new to epilation in general, nor to the BRAUN devices in particular. I have been using an older model braun epilator for many years and I decided a while ago (after trying various other methods of hair removal) that epilation is the best option for me. It is safe to say, I knew very well what I was getting myself into and as a result I am more than happy with my purchase. Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVER-ALL PERFORMANCE / POWER:&lt;br /&gt;I can see a clear improvement in performance from my old device. It feels like the Silk-epil 7 has more power and works more precisely. In short: it gets more hair at the first attempt. The various heads that come with it make it also easier to reach the area that you want, without pinching any skin or removing too much hair.&lt;br /&gt;The light is a nice plus too, but I would not say that I can´t do without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CORDLESS:&lt;br /&gt;It may not seem that important, but not being restricted by a cord is a huge plus! For some reason, the cord of my old device was alway in my way and never long enough for me to take a comfortable position. Sometimes the plug would come loose on the device and it would stop working while I was moving around to reach the back of my legs. That is finally all in the past and I am glad that I can now move around freely and unrestricted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATERPROOF:&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that always bothered me with my old device was the thought that I could not give it a real good rinse down to clean it every once in a while. While I have never used my silk-epil in the shower and probably never will, I am relieved to know that the device is waterproof and I can simply hold it under the faucet, when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTRAS:&lt;br /&gt;The device comes with a fair selection of extra heads and some epilation whips. When shopping around for a new epilator, I was not entirely sure if I would need those extras, but now that I tried it, I am actually happy to have them! As I mentioned before: The heads really help making the job easy and the whips, to my surprise, really work! I probably mostly appreciate, that the whips prevent the little red bumps that usually appear after epilation and then slowly fade within a couple of hours. Before, I had to wear long pants for the rest of the day or epilate in the evening so my skin would have enough time to regenerate. Now, there is hardly anything to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY LIFE:&lt;br /&gt;I have read a couple of reviews prior to my purchase, where people had trouble with battery life. I can honestly say, that this was never a problem for me. I am actually impressed with how long a battery charge lasts. After reading those reviews I expected to have to plug it in after every use, while in fact, I can use it a couple of times before it runs out of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I would recommend this to every one who is looking into buying an epilator. I must say though, that epilation simply is not for everyone. After years of using this method, my hair grow is very moderate and so is the level of discomfort when using this device. For someone who is new to epilation it is probably different and it might take a little getting used to and maybe even a bit of practice to handle the device with maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;I did recommend this device to one of my friends who had never used an epilator in her life and she seems to be very happy with her purchase. Generally, I would say, if you can handle hot wax, you can handle this.</li>
    <li> Perfect and also I&#x27;m happy to buy a Nader one my vife she&#x27;s so exaidet on this item it&#x27;s all i vant</li>
    <li> I own the previous dry model which I have had for possibly5-6 years and have loved.  This model kicks butt!  I love using it in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like the dry epilators.  It works at least as well and I think better than the previous model.  The best thing about having it in the shower too is that I like to shave after to get any missed hairs and to get that super smooth skin.  By shaving after, I feel like it gets the missed hair to be ready for epilating &amp;#34;next time&amp;#34; and since the hairs are less fine I think it actually gets them next time.  My shower is dark and I feel like the light provides enough light to see what I&#x27;m doing and actually, it might even light them better in the dark as I have blonde hair and it&#x27;s hard to see them.</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator.  I had a much cheaper one to begin with and I liked it (Philips HP6512 Satinelle Soft Epilator, White/Purple). It lasted for almost exactly one year then developed a problem with the cord. Anyway, I did a little research online and found that people really liked this one. I can now see why!  Love how fast it removes the hair and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the other one did (and the other one didn&#x27;t really hurt much at all).  I reallly like that it is cordless and the light is a must!  I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet so don&#x27;t know how well it works when wet.</li>
    <li> The light is helpful but epil is just so so.  Not worth the price</li>
    <li> I have never used an epilator before, so I was pretty ignorant about how to use it, or what the results should look like.&lt;br /&gt;It does hurt, I&#x27;ll admit, but after about the second go, I don&#x27;t really notice anymore. No pain, no gain. ;)&lt;br /&gt;When using, I can literally see the hairs go away. It isn&#x27;t a gimmick or anything - the hairs are actually getting plucked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When purchasing an epilator, expect to replace the act of shaving your legs and underarms. So, as opposed to shaving every day (I am really adamant about having smooth legs), I only epilate once a week to achieve the same, if not better, effect. Saves a ton of time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part about epilating instead of shaving is the lessened skin irritation. When I shaved every to every other day, my skin was not having it (I have pretty sensitive skin), and my underarms looked terrible, with lots of little red bumps. Using this epilator completely took care of that issue, and now I look like a normal human being! (yay)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a higher pain tolerance and like to save some time, I say this product is for you.</li>
    <li> Ouch! First time to epilate and I must say that it is a painful process. I will hopefully get used to this. The product does what it says it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife two months ago and its stopped functioning. Frankly, I never expected such low standards from Braun even if it&#x27;s made in China. My wife has always taken extra care of it since the time it came. Ensuring that post removal the tweezers and head were clean from hair and dirt. The motor is working but the tweezer heads have stopped functioning (don&#x27;t rotate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) First I dont expect any electronic item to have such shabby standards that they don&#x27;t even last 6 months. She had previously using an older Braun version (silk epil 3) for the last 5 years. It still works!&lt;br /&gt;2)The claim made by Braun that this works in the shower is not 100% true. The hair tend to slip and hence this is not as effective in wet mode. Save your money and dont buy such an expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;3) I am not at all happy that Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer any refunds on such items beyond 30 days. These are performance cosmetics and supposed to stand the test of time. Stonrgly recommend buying from FOLICA.com. On top of the 30 day money  back they back their products by the warranty replacement policy. Spares you the hassle of calling up the vendor once you are past Amazon&#x27;s 30 days guarantee. AMAZON are you listening!??</li>
    <li> I tried similar products years ago found them painful&lt;br /&gt;Tried the Braun on the lowest, gentlest setting and didn&#x27;t feel a thing -&lt;br /&gt;braun silk-epil7 the best&lt;br /&gt;ciao</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the features yet, only used it dry so far. But the fact that there is no power cord attached gives so much flexibility. I had another model before, so I am used to Braun products. Very reliable, and go for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator i would buy again and i recomend it  , i love the light that comes with it  and this one u can use in the shower ... it is a bit painful but is worth the pain</li>
    <li> I am still learning to use this without bruising myself.  I used it on my jawline and it was too much.  I use it on my neck and it works well.  I always have these odd hairs that are from my chin to the adams apple, which I usually tweeze. I aslo use on my underarm.  Where the skin is flat and taut, this works like a dream.  When the skin begins to soften. wrinkle and curve then the epil has a harder time.  Since it takes one hand to hold it, that only leave one hand for holding skin taut.  On the legs, it&#x27;s so easy.  I have very sparse leg hair, so I really hate paying for a wax.  This is a dream come true for that.  I will stop waxing my legs, but the jury is still out for underarms.  It was too painful in the bikini area, so I think I will continue to wax. Perhaps when the season returns, I can try to use for maintenance after waxing.</li>
    <li> Using this to epilate testicles can be a real adventure. Made me bleed twice the first time, and got my scrotum tangled up the second time. Scared the hell out of me till I realized that all I had to do was turn it off and rotate it opposite the direction it normally moved. I gotta say--it actually hurt less than the epilation itself, in some ways. The pain definitely decreases with use. I&#x27;d put the pain at about 6 or 7/10, at least at the beginning of epilation. Surface-level pinching/pricking. It&#x27;s the volume of pain that makes it difficult at first, but I got used to it fairly quickly. I only use it on my nuts and taint, so not a lot of hair to begin with, in my case at least. I&#x27;d disregard all the &amp;#34;use dry&amp;#34; recommendations--best in the shower with soap to lube up the skin, at least for me. Shaving&#x27;s less painful, but it&#x27;s its own pain the balls. I no longer get complaints about long hairs or prickly new hairs when my wife sucks my ball, so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Its very simple to use, it was painful at first, if you want to know what its going to be like use tweezers on a hair on your leg, but after a week of using it on my legs it no longer hurts, BUT i find that no matter how many times (weeks later now) i cannot get all the hair removed. I tried it on my bikini area once, 1 1/2 hours later i was 3 inches in and in a sweat on the bathroom floor. I have gotten Brazilian waxes for year, granted its been a year since my last one, and i could not get through it, i used the trimmer to the desired length. tried a quarter inch a time, would stop and break for 5 minutes and try the area again.  I have tried my armpits and found it wasn&#x27;t as painful as the bikini area but due to the angle i couldn&#x27;t get all the hair. Even though i now am able to use this on one area i still save on shaving cream since i only need it for one area and do not go through all that product as quickly, would recommend to only those with the will power to push through the pain.</li>
    <li> This is the best product EVER! Works perfectly and is beautiful. No problems at all! I jus love it! It is exactly like the seller tell us.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Not without a little pain but you get used to it really fast. Works well and unlike some other reviewers I found that all the different heads were good for different things.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of epilators.  This one is as good as any.  It seems to grab the shortest possible. Attachments are very helpful. Battery life is great.  You must exfoliate to get good results. I use a bristle brush, stroking upwards toward my heart.  That alone has good benefits for you!  After I epilate I use ACV or a toner, then moisturise.  This works best for me in preventing ingrown hair.  Epilation is painful initially, I don&#x27;t really notice it now.</li>
    <li> Does the job right. I love the freedom of cordless. Yet to use it during global travel. Extras are useful, I like the shaving attachment. LIght is bright. Charge stays long time. I could use it for sitting at my porch or even in car or work-without coirds- anywhere you have some privacy. I am looking to use it more often, but I don&#x27;t see thick hair growth to use it... :-p some touch ups every few days will keep skin hairless always.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, anywhere, both on wet or dry skin. Quick charge with long battery life. It gives relatively pain free hair removal. However my older corded model was slightly better at getting all the hairs.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use it.  I found though that it just broke off my hair and caused in grown hairs.</li>
    <li> This is a simple, painless (in my opinion) and inexpensive way to take care of unwanted hair.  Read the instructions&lt;br /&gt;before using!</li>
    <li> Best epilator, braun epilator products are very good. It isn&#x27;t aggressive and works perfect (hurts but not as much). In your private areas prefer the shaver but it&#x27;s possible to use the epilator (you have to be carefully because it really hurts).</li>
    <li> I was having trouble with shaving bumps and irritation on my inner leg.  The Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator works well.  USE IT UNDER WATER! much less pain.  Hair grows in much lighter.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I have ever had. Yes it was super painful to begin with, and there are areas that are more sensitive than others but once you get used to it its fine. Its basically the same amount of pain you get from waxing, except its a slower process so you have to endure pain for longer. The product itself is very nice, it works really well, and the battery on mine seems to be lasting longer than what they tell you to expect. I like all the different product heads and the shaver option is really cool. Its very easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t pinch your skin what so ever, even when I went over a small mole thats on my leg the epilator wasn&#x27;t phased. Just go for it!</li>
    <li> Great idea but short on the execution.  Got this when my wife expressed an interest in it after reading about it and checking the reviews on Amazon.  Well, her final take on it ranks her among the low end reviewers.  She said if she had &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; to do her legs, it might be okay.  Bottom line.... one Harry&#x27;s razor + less time + less pain &#x3D; a happier wife with smooth legs.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hairs quickly. You have to swipe through the area a lot to get rid of all hairs. The design is really attractive though.</li>
    <li> best thing ever&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much,&lt;br /&gt;. . . . . . . .. . . .. .</li>
    <li> Got this because I was looking for an epilator, but also wanted a shaver if I was going to spend the money.  I have been really happy with this product since purchasing, it travels well -- we took a weeklong trip and I didn&#x27;t need to charge it once).  I ultimately use the shaving attachment the most, as it is easier and quicker (when I epliated I took a long soak first to soften the hair follicles etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reading many of the reviews for this product, I found I was overall comfortable ordering, even if I didn&#x27;t end up using it primarily as an epilator.  That did turn out to be the case for me, but I am still more than happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I really like it. I have a couple of areas of facial hair, my 25 yr old epi silk died, ordered new one but did not do facial hair, this one is perfect. Never considered epi for legs, but it did a great job</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. The light (against my expectations) is helpful to be able to better see the hairs. For my it was important to use the epilator in different parts of the body and it is possible with this model. Apart from that, after using the epilator the hairs are so weak that many of them grow under the skin; but this is a common problem by using these devices.&lt;br /&gt;In general, I like the product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This epilator is really worth buying.  It is light weight and small. It works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Before I was going to buy this product I read almost all the reviews, Most of them said that this epilator was really really painful and the cord came out. About the cord, you need to hear a snap noise right after you put it in or else it may fall out. The pain...... I am 12 years of age and have been epilating for a year. The first time, it was painful.  If you shave, then yes, it will feel very painful.  But give your body some time and it will completely get used to it. The first few times that I epilated I was doing it once a week. Then, after about three to four times of epilating, you can start doing it every three to four weeks and not have stubble. It comes with five attachments and all of them work great. As far as how it has held up I can&#x27;t say I have only had it for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun has really made their epilators build to last. My mother has had hers for 15+ years and it still works fine.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Never tried an Epilator before this one.  I read a lot of reviews, and even though it was a little more expensive than I thought I would be spending, I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others mentioned, using it the first time is painful.  It also takes considerably longer to epilate than it does to shave.  However you don&#x27;t have to epilate everyday, so all in all I believe I am spending less time on my legs.  I think the biggest advantage to using an epilator over a razor is that the hair growth is significantly less after you&#x27;ve been using it a month or two, so even going 3-5 days in the summer short weather without epilating is not really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mine about a year, and I am really glad I bought this one.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems--although I believe it is dulling a bit.  I wish I could buy a replacement head for it, over having to buy an entirely new one, but alas all my inquiries to do so have been for naught.  :(  All said, It is worth the price! and I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> It was the first time in 15 years that I bought a epilator. What a change. It barely hurts (except for the armpits), it is high quality and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotion. I was a bit skeptical when I got this offer. 15 years ago I tried an epilator, that thing hurt so bad, I was shaking by the time I was done. The hair came back 3 days later, I never got a smooth feel. This product is different, I used it 3 days in a row, because hair grows at different rates, I was able to use it the day after I had shaved, it pulls stubble, and a huge bonus..it hurts way less than they used to. I really like it a lot</li>
    <li> I used this product for a few hours before the battery died. When I plugged in the charger in order to recharge the battery, everything seemed normal. I checked back a few minutes later to see if it was still charging, and to my surprise: it wasn&#x27;t. I think my product had a defect of some sort. As a result, I had to ship it to the manufacturer to have it fixed.</li>
    <li> I love the multiple shaving heads, wet or dry choice and ease of use along with the light to illuminate the way.</li>
    <li> Initially This devise was more painful to use than I imagined...HOWEVER as the instructions did say..with continued use second or third time and experimenting with the variety of heads it is definitely manageable and efficient. I will continue to plug along no pun intended...but the devise does pluck the hairs OUT as advertised. The price of beauty LOL.</li>
    <li> This epilator works pretty good, although I had read it would only require one or two passes to get the job done, I feel it still misses some spots, so I have to go over a few times more to get the result I want. I hadn&#x27;t used an epilator for years and was expecting it would hurt really bad, but not at all. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This epillator works fabulously. Easy to use and easy to clean. Lots of attachments makes it extremely versatile. Also holds it&#x27;s charge for a very long time. Great product!</li>
    <li> easy to use - less painful when used in the shower</li>
    <li> It works really well. The problem with these machines though is that after a couple of years they stop working as well as they did in the beginning. It&#x27;s already my 3rd...</li>
    <li> I used this product on my legs, arms, and face (once, with the face attachment). On my legs, it caused a lot of ingrown hairs, despite exfoliation. On my arms, it seems to work fine. It caused serious inflammation and acne on my face the one time I used it. I still use it on my arms. However, I have not noticed any change in the amount of hair, the hair thickness, or the hair color. I think waxing is more effective, less painful, and overall a better value.</li>
    <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews unless my expectations were surpassed. This review is no different. Braun did an amazing job at creating the wet and dry epilator. Not only does it function as an epilator, but as as a normal shaver as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to pain, the wipes the product comes with really help. As others have mentioned I found that the pain was primarily in my head. I went into it thinking it would hurt and it did. When I stop thinking about it though I didn&#x27;t even notice. It does feel weird the first time you do it, but it&#x27;s easy to get used to and once you see the results you won&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how well it works, it&#x27;s great! Not only have my legs been smooth for over two weeks, but because the motor is high powered and the product made really well, my boyfriend has ditched his shaver and started to use the shaver portion of mine. The light is a huge bonus as well. You don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d use it, but once you do you realize how much of a benefit it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other notes, the product is really easy to clean and comes apart with ease. Like I already stated, it&#x27;s built really well and suspect it should last me many years...unless I decided to upgrade later on to a newer version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not plan on finding this any cheaper than on Amazon. I searched for this in stores such as Target, Walmart, and Walgreens. The only Braun I found was at Walmart and it was ten dollars more expensive and the older version that only contains one head versus the five this one has. Amazon also gave me a coupon for ten dollars off for free.</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  I&#x27;ve used to shave my legs and also to epillate.  Save yoiur money and keep shaving with a disposable.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get the smallest of hairs like it promises. I will continue using it for a few months to see if there is an change. I haven&#x27;t tried my underarms or bikini line. The pain it caused on my legs was enough for me!</li>
    <li> I decided to finally buy an epilator after feeling that I was wasting money paying someone else to torture...I mean wax my bikini area. In my impatience I bought it at Target and found out I only paid $5 more, which is fine with me. I already am \\&quot;that mom\\&quot; that wears a bikini, I didn&#x27;t want to be \\&quot;that mom\\&quot; that wears a bikini and sports a jungle in the nether regions...hence this purchase. I brought it home and CAREFULLY read through each detail of the instruction pamphlet. I thought I&#x27;d start with my underarm. My first thought to the two second experience was, \\&quot;HOLY HELL and GREAT BALLS OF FIRE that hurts like heck!\\&quot; But with some bravery I continued in the bikini area. It still hurt like heck. I couldn&#x27;t believe I had purposely purchase a re-purposed torture method from the Renaissance Period and applied it to my hooha area! This is the stuff that I&#x27;m sure will be used in the future to extract information from the bad guys. I did, however, continue and with continuing I realized that the pain was mostly in my mind and I did get used to it. I applied coconut oil afterwards to the freshly epilated area. Please don&#x27;t respond and tell me that coconut oil is the absolute worst thing to apply...I don&#x27;t want to know at this point. I will say that in the morning the redness was gone and it&#x27;s so soft! I will be epilating from now until my 90s. It may take a care giver to do it for me at that time, but I am completely sold on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update September 28, 2013- I am still loving this epilator. Now after using it for some time I can say how pleased that I am with the fact the my underarms are so soft and don&#x27;t show all of the dark bumps from regrowth. I also love how I only need to use it a couple of times per week to keep up with the new growth. It&#x27;s fast and my skin is used to it so it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t quit after my first experience. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I love the new Braun silk epil!! It does a much faster and efficient job. We have to remember to charge it before using, Becoz it only works wirelessly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not perfect but pretty darn close.</li>
    <li> Works great! Ladies go for it!!!</li>
    <li> I like it.  It is perfect for everyone. The best thing that it doesn&#x27;t need so much time to charge.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with it.</li>
    <li> This works better then at least a couple others I have tried. Its faster solution. Now my mom and other friends want it too.</li>
    <li> No better than the cheaper Braun version bar being able to use it while wet.</li>
    <li> Super painful! But it does work. Ended up returning because of pain</li>
    <li> Am thrilled with the Braun SE7681 Silk-epil 7 wet and dry epilator. Tons of power. Gets the job done quickly. It did &amp;#34;run over&amp;#34; my lip on the first run. It says to stretch skin tight. It means it. Great product. Great seller.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. As expected, met each detail specified in the add. Fast and prompt delivery. Highly recommended. I am sure you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this and I&#x27;m so happy I did. I have very sensitive skin with coarse dark hair. I have to shave my legs every day and I still end up with sharp irritating stubble. The upside is that I have a decent tolerance for pain, which led me to discover epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to epilating, however I am no stranger to ripping my hair out at the root for a smooth and long lasting finish. I have had my legs, underarms, and Brazilian waxed at a salon as well as at home by yours truly. I have also grown tired of the at home wax clean up and broke by spending a small fortune for continuous trips to the salon for hit or miss results (my personal estethician only does the most amazing brazilians so for other parts of me I&#x27;m at another persons mercy). So after some extensive research I decided to try epilating and I&#x27;m hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a prime member so for $3 I had it FedEx delivered next day. I prepped myself (or rather didn&#x27;t prep myself) for this experience by letting my hair grow on my legs and under arms for about a week. Yes, it was super glorious in this 90 degree weather but that is an experience of it&#x27;s own. I plugged in my Braun 7, and in the time it took for me to have breakfast and clean up the house it was fully charged. I started on my right  leg with the massager attachment, and with short but slow strokes cleared a hairless path through my leg jungle in about 4 passes. AMAZZZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensation is literally like small prickly needles tapping into your skin, but it is over immediately. No lingering pain or the risk of burning or scratches like shaving or waxing. The trick is short strokes, taught skin, and small areas. Midway through, I abandoned the massager cap for the efficiency cap and was able to finish both legs in a bit over an hour (I did have to break to recharge but keep in mind I was working through a small man worthy forest!) The light is a huge help as well to point out visible loners that resisted, but they didn&#x27;t stand a chance. I tried to do my inner upper thigh just outside the bikini area, but it was a no go. I will probably have to get it waxed with a Brazilian and maintain it with the Epilator. It was too painful for the amount of hair that had grown out. Kudos to the girls who can use it to deforest the neither regions. It&#x27;s not happening here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after my legs, I decided to try my armpits. But I wanted to test out the wet feature. So after a shower, along with the under arm attachment, under running water I began. CRAAAPPPP!!!! The pits are the pits. My underarms have some of the coarsest textured hair on my body :( I felt like it wasn&#x27;t catching the hairs fully, only tugging them painfully without getting them out. And they were so dry from neglect and harsh deodorant that the water seemed to just bead up rather than aid in the process. I needed my pits to allow the Epilator to glide over them and do its thing. So I lathered on a bit of Dr. Bronners bar soap (the liquid one is too drying for me) and BINGO!!! My gnarly pit hair seemed to be charmed right on out of their comfy little pore homes. I think that is the secret to under arms, keeping them slick and a lubed up. In five minutes both puts were clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my final recap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Short charging time&lt;br /&gt;Truly pulls from the root&lt;br /&gt;Easily dissembles for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Light feature&lt;br /&gt;Different caps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;Wish it held a charge longer than about 45 min&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of this experience I was a bit welted (as I would be after waxing) so I popped a couple Advil and now in the morning I&#x27;m all good. I plan on exfoliating with my clarisonic pro body brush and will do an updated review to share the longevity of my results. But so far I&#x27;m a likin!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I had never even heard of an epilator before, let alone knew what it did. It being my first time I will admit it was painful, but over time the pain significantly lessens. I only have to epilate twice a week as opposed to shaving everyday. This product was well worth the money, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my Braun Silk-epil 7 a lot. It works really well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty great! It charges fast and it barely hurts.</li>
    <li> I hate it!!!!!!  Don&#x27;t buy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;All those different heads are for the birds.  They are not needed AND they impede the shaving process.  Unfortunately for me I waited to long to process the return.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> well as painful as this is I do like it. it has alight on it i love for helping me see the hair. it tweezes the hair no nice smooth skin. i like to do it at night before i go to bed so the redness goes away while i sleep. might not hurt so bad if i was a waxer but i am not.</li>
    <li> The item arrived but I didn&#x27;t try it until one month late, it doesn&#x27;t work at all and the return is not available anymore on this order.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot find either any customer care contact number to call in all the website!</li>
    <li> More than I expected.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator. I used it today for the first time. I did my legs and underarms. It worked great. It was painful but no worse than waxing and will save me a boat load of money. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product. I first began using epilators a couple of months ago, and this one is my favorite so far. It is much more efficient at removing hair than the other brands I have tried, and it is also faster. As a person who positively despises shaving, this product has been a godsend for me. I also love that it comes with an attachment for shaving as well (it comes with several other attachments too, but I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll be using them). The only thing I do not like about it so far is that you cannot use it while it is plugged in to charge. I understand it is for safety purposes since you can use the epilator in water, but it really bothers me because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be using this in the bath or shower. Therefore, I wish they would make a dry-only version of this product. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a great alternative to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes for first-time epilator-users considering this product (or any other epilator):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Epilating is painful, but it isn&#x27;t unbearable. You will certainly get used to it over time.&lt;br /&gt;- Epilating is time-consuming when you&#x27;re first starting out (it definitely takes longer than shaving), but your results will last much longer. I do not see my hair start to grow back until about two weeks after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;- The places where I have seen the absolute best results from epilating are around my bikini line and my underarms. Seriously, you will never see those areas look so smooth and irritation-free for so long! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re consistent with epilating, you will see less hair regrowth over time.</li>
    <li> My wife is really picky but she loves this epilator, she was waxing all the time before and now she just using this and works great. Also you will need to get use to it because it&#x27;s a little bit painful in the beginning .</li>
    <li> Just received a couple weeks ago and have used only a couple of times. Fingers crossed I am very happy with the purchase. I just wish they made a model that had a cord. I have had to let it recharge both times before I have finished.</li>
    <li> It works great and I would of give it a 5 if and only if it didn&#x27;t have this 1 huge minus. So its wireless... You have to charge it before use. Once charged its only good for about 30-40 mins... and the worst part is...you can&#x27;t use it when its charging... So to shave both legs can take the whole day since full charging can take up to an hr... If I could use when when its charging even if its not wireless anymore when charging I would of really love this product....</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun for 16 years. Had two models before this one I love them all great product never goes bad and amazing results.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th epilator I&#x27;m trying and it works great so far (using it for about 6 months now).&lt;br /&gt;The most important features of this BRAUN epilator are that it&#x27;s cordless and water-friendly! I do not use it in actual water because it seems to be less efficient. However, I am happy I can properly wash/clean it after! I can&#x27;t imagine now how I could deal with those I had before that were supposed to stay dry.&lt;br /&gt;Do I need comment on having no cord? It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m free to move around without caring about the cord getting on my way or being to short. (Note: You cannot use it when it&#x27;s charging, so if battery is gone, you had to wait until it gets at least a bit charged.)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, best epilator I used!</li>
    <li> I love this, works great wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Works well, but use the prep towel to prevent &amp;#34;pinching&amp;#34; sensation.</li>
    <li> Now the first time Oh.my.god. it was not enjoyable, it got the job done but very painfully, i dreaded the second time but i went on and did it anyway. then it turned out the second time wasnt half as bad, and now ive been using it every time i see hair appear, i really feel nothing more than a soft massaging vibration and a few tingly feeling then its over and done with! and all im left with is soft smooth HAIRLESS skin!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. Its super compact and easy to use.</li>
    <li> So, I went through multiple epilator reviews on several beauty websites before going with this model. It came highly recommended and now I know why! The light is a must! The epilator and its various attachments are great as well. My biggest surprise was the electric razor/clipper head...it&#x27;s fantastic!!!! It actually works as a shaver! (I&#x27;ve tried other electric shaver in the past that never cut the hair, its like the hair couldn&#x27;t squeeze into the tiny metal holes, but this does!) I&#x27;m glad I paid extra and went with this model,I got more than I paid for! It&#x27;s saving me so much time and is really nice to use while watching TV vs in the shower...although I could use it in the shower if I wanted to because its waterproof! :)</li>
    <li> I used it and explicitly followed the directions.  It took off my above the lip hair along with some of my skin.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> It does a very nice job on my legs.  It comes with several head covers, and the epilator head can be replaced with a shaver head, which I have not tried yet.  I find it more comfortable than my old model (decades old) and the light makes it easy to see hairs even when I don&#x27;t have direct sunlight. Being cordless is a big plus for me.  I have not tried it in the shower yet.  Since this came with an underarm cover, I tried to epilate my underarms for the first time.  It did work, but was not nearly so comfortable as using in on my legs. I can see why they include the shaver head. I did like the results, so I will probably try it again.&lt;br /&gt;It takes less time to use than my old one, because I can see what hairs I have missed with the light.  I had no problem doing both legs on one charge, and it took only a few minutes to fully charge again. The pouch is a tight fit for the epilator and the heads, but it will work for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because it isn&#x27;t really comfortable doing my underarms, but that may change as I get used to it.</li>
    <li> First of all, I want to tell that I have been epilating for a long time, and this epilator probably my 6th one! The battery lasts very long time with Braun! It pickes the very short hair easily so I don&#x27;t have to let it grow! It is very quite comparing the other ones also. Having light feature makes it convenient to use in the evenings! I am totally loving it!</li>
    <li> I gave it to My wife and she said &amp;#34;yeah it hurts a bit but after some time your skin adapt of it, The massagers is very effective,it&#x27;s really do help. In short this epilator works pretty good.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The epilator hurt a great deal and didn&#x27;t work well. Wet or dry, I was not pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I can take a lot of pain but to inflict pain on myself to get eh results is not my thing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> OK - I really like this thing.  I use it on my arms and legs.  I also use it to remove the maybe three hairs I have under each arm.  I am Asian, so I am not really furry and this thing keeps me from having to deal with razor burn.  Twice a week for ten minutes and I am good.  That&#x27;s a lot less time than I used to spend shaving and there is no stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought one for my cousin&#x27;s wife who is a lot furrier.  She is not so happy with it.</li>
    <li> OK. This is my first epilator. OMG. Pain and more pain! BUT I can see how it will get easier with frequent use. Kind of like when we first started plucking the eyebrows it was so painful. I love this epilator and will keep using it. I hate having to shave EVERY day and this will save time and  lots of money. When it comes to having my hair ripped from my body I did NOT want to go cheep. Haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my first epilator (I&#x27;ve owned four of them beginning in the 1980&#x27;s, but was very interested in the Wet/Dry aspect of the Silk-epil.  I haven&#x27;t tried the Wet way yet, but ohmygod, I had to review this immediately since I just used it.  This worked perfectly with a single pass on my lower legs!  I will say, that as with all epilators, the longer the hair the more pain. I&#x27;ve been testing. I hadn&#x27;t shaved my left leg for more than a week, but shaved my right leg three days ago. The left leg was more painful of course, but still required only a single swipe with the Silk-epil. The right leg hair was so short that I was sure it wouldn&#x27;t work much if at all, but I was wrong - a single pass cleaned away all hair.  I was so shocked, that I had to double check that I wasn&#x27;t using the razor/trimmer head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is FANTASTIC - it&#x27;s aimed at the skin directly at the path in front of the Silk-epil and lights the way while you&#x27;re going. Absolutely amazing feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes one hour to charge before the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back to update after using it on my bikini area (ouch), my face (ouchier) and underarms (surprisingly the almost unbearable ouchiest)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------UPDATE 07/30/2013  FACE: to be fair, I haven&#x27;t explored or used any of the heads and I probably should have.  It works okay on my face. Thankfully, I did only my left cheek because I now look like a crackhead (albeit a fat one) because somewhere along the timeline of my 56 years, that left cheek became ultra sensitive and broke out in itchy welts hours after epilating. Honestly, I felt no pain while using the Silk-epil there, and it there was such a time lag about breaking out, that at first, I didn&#x27;t relate it to the epilation. I Googled and found that it did. I cleansed properly before and after and thought I did everything correctly, so it&#x27;s probably my hormones. Why not, they&#x27;ve made lots of my parts wacky, why not my face.  I&#x27;m dreading the armpitand already know that I&#x27;ll only do one to test first.</li>
    <li> Very nice tool, it work very good dooing a nice job leave the skin soft and smooth . Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product a lot i have try other ones but this one is just perfect for me</li>
    <li> Soft, practicall and excellent results. I just to have the Silk Epil 5 and i was a true fanatic, but after i try Silk-Epil 7 i saw the results i was really amaze!!! it feels great! it is really easy to use. The only thing i will want more, is the travel bag, i will love if the bag was like the other Silk Epil carriying bags.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. I&#x27;ve been using the Emjoi Optima Chorded Epilator for a few years now and I love it. It can only be used on dry skin though. In an effort to ease some discomfort and be more efficient time-wise, I thought I would try an epilator you can use in water. I tried this in the shower, the tub, and dry (just like I would use my Optima) and I must say, this couldn&#x27;t compare to the Optima.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed that the shower was the better option for the Braun SE7681. I tried it on my legs first and was disappointed because I noticed that when I got out and toweled off there were a ton of missed hairs and even a few that weren&#x27;t pulled out all the way. My legs tend to have the most stubborn hairs, so I decided to try it on my underarms which is usually much easier. With my Optima, I can remove every single hair, thick or thin, from my underarms relatively quickly and with almost no pain/discomfort. The Braun missed shorter and thinner hairs that would have been no problem for the Optima and because it kept missing hairs I had to go back and forth multiple times (sometimes at a ridiculously slow rate) to try and clean up the areas it missed. Even after spending three times longer than normal for me on the area, the Braun just didn&#x27;t seem able to pick up all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was very little to no pain using the the Braun wet, but I noticed that using it dry was a bit more uncomfortable. It seemed that the &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34; just couldn&#x27;t get a good enough grasp on some of the hairs, so I would see hairs broken off, half out of the folicle or just missed all together. This also caused some pinching and tugging sensations I don&#x27;t normally get with the Optima.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m very disappointed. I liked the feel of the machine in my hands and the flexible head felt nice gliding over contours. I also really loved that it was cordless. It was a bit noisy, especially in the tub, but regardless I really wanted to like this product. So sadbut compared to my Optima, this was a joke.</li>
    <li> Love it. It is thorough and quick. Definitely worth it. It takes no time to do my armpits and it seems to take care of all the hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun epilators for the past 8+ years.  My previous epilators I used for a bout 3-4 years and eventually I had to replace them because the blades got dull and didn&#x27;t seem to epliate as effectively.  I used the corded Braun epliator, most recently the 5395 model.  I was very happy with it other than it getting dull.  Since I needed a new epilator, I decided I should upgrage and go with a higher level model, hence buying the 7681 model.  It&#x27;s been a big disappointment!!  My disappointment is due to the following: 1) the cordless model isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful as the corded models that I&#x27;ve had in the past and the motor has very little momentum 2) due to #1, I find that it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as well and my hair grows back much quicker than it did with my corded model 3) it&#x27;s very ineffective on underarm hair and I actually have to remove the cover piece completely in order to remove underarm hair.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s too late for me to return this item, but I needed the time to test it out and see how it worked.  Now I know and I will likely spend more money to replace this because using it feels like a wasted effort.  My recommendation is to stick to a corded epilator (Braun or other brands).  This one is not worth the extra expense.</li>
    <li> F A N T A S T I C !&lt;br /&gt;Works incredibly well. Being cordless an awesome plus.</li>
    <li> I very much like my new epilator - except I have to keep it plugged in when not in use. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to start when it&#x27;s plugged in. So other than the inconvenience of keeping it plugged, I very much like it.</li>
    <li> I actually used this to prepare for IPL using carbon dye. I found that a numbing cream was essential. The device grabbed all of the hairs and left my skin smooth albeit red. The redness calmed down in a couple of days. It also helps to apply a good ingrown bump cream because i hear epilation can cause these. Using the cream i came away without one ingrown hair. My hairs grew back slowly over a number of days and much lighter. Although i got this machine only for eplilation i found that the included shaver head worked really well. I bought this one because i couldnt not afford Brauns pricey Epil 9. I sacrificed nothing but the price by buying this cheaper model and am very happy with my first results. I will be doing my second and less need epilation in a few!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this epilator. I purchased my machine from Amazon September 2014 and it&#x27;s still going strong. I wasted thousands of dollars with laser (waste of money for African-American women) and other hair removal products that left me with thick stubble. This epilator has left my skin soft and silky.  I only have to maintain the removal process once or twice a week vs twice a day for other methods. I also love the many attachments that comes with this epilator. As the other reviewers have mentioned, I had tears in my eyes after the first use. This discomfort lessons with each use. I keep tend skin or tea tree oil handy however I have noticed a substantial decrease in hair bumps when using this epilator.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it says it can remove hairs as fine as a grain of sand. Well, I have to call bs on that one. I have tried using it wet, dry, and with all the different head attachments that come with the epilator. I have gone slow, fast, around in circles, every direction physics will allow. I have tried it over areas with hairs that don&#x27;t even look fine, but because they lay flat, the thing will not grab them. After opening the product and realizing that the tweezers were plastic on one half, I should have just repacked it and returned it then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product is unusable. I might as well have popped open the kitchen trash can and dropped eighty dollars in there. My old epilator that I bought for forty dollars is going to have to hold out for a little bit longer, it seems, but I won&#x27;t be trying another Braun.</li>
    <li> I have used another brand of epilator, but I prefer this batar.&lt;br /&gt;I will recomond this product to other people</li>
    <li> I like this thing. It is painful, especially the first time you use it because you&#x27;re yanking so many hairs out at once. but once you get into a groove it&#x27;s a really nice alternative to messy waxing and uncomfortable shaving stubble. I can only use it on my lower leg, too painful anywhere else, but maybe I&#x27;m just a baby :D</li>
    <li> I love this epilator. Let me say first I am fairly new to alternative hair removal. I have been a shaver all my life and just recently decided to get my first wax. Immediately after I knew there had to be a less expensive way to achieve the same results. So I did as everyone else and went about searching and came across epilation....I had never heard of it. I read all the reviews and decided this was the one to try and it&#x27;s excellent. It came fully charged (yay) and with the help of Pinterest I found many useful tried and true tips. I love that this particular model comes with so many different attachments. It took me awhile to work up the nerve to do anything beyond my legs after reading all that I did. Fortunately because this model has all that it does once I did work up the nerve it was easy peasy. This epilator is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Best ting ever! It was a bit painful to start but I got used to it and it is painless now! Works very well and excellent on my facial hairs!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I did not like it and would not recommend this product to anyone. Returning!&lt;br /&gt;I am not new to &amp;#34;Epilating&amp;#34; so in the first 2 minutes of using this epilator, I knew I am returning it. It missed the fine hair on my legs and broke the thicker ones instead of pulling them out by the root. I am looking for a good quality epilator now and Braun SE7681 is definitely not going to work for me.</li>
    <li> I like it. that&#x27;s great, I&#x27;ve not shave every day anymore!!! it&#x27;s too comfortable to use. I advice to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with results after the first use (dry method) on my legs... very smooth.  It didn&#x27;t take long to get used to the prickly feel and I didn&#x27;t have any irritation.  This is MUCH better than waxing!  I used the facial attachment as directed, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to remove the few stray dark hairs on my chin/neck area.  Works great for longer peach fuzz leaving a smooth natural look.  It did need recharging after about 20 minutes use, but I didn&#x27;t need to give it an initial charge straight from the box.</li>
    <li> Each time I use this I am able to use it less frequently! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite hairy for a woman, so I have to use it every week. Performs perfectly fine; love the curved shape and glittery body of the epilator; little  light bulb is very nice too, my bathroom is kind of dark, so it helps a lot actually. I&#x27;m not sure about the wet part though, it doesn&#x27;t really work for me, the haires barely get pulled out, but I&#x27;m using to dry roils ting anyway, this it&#x27;s not a disadvantage for me. Make sure you keep the battery charged after using the device, so you don&#x27;t run into situation where it fails on you when you need it. The recharging time is not long, but it still benefits to have it all ready to go. Easy clean up, quite an amount of different heads to choose from.</li>
    <li> You get a sleek device that gets the job done and the additional attachments makes this epilator a good buy.</li>
    <li> I actually never knew what an epilator was until my friend told me about hers. Being a waxer/plucker the epilator sounded like an amazing product, and it is! After a bit of research I decided on buying this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is beautiful, white and sparkly. When being held you can tell immediately that it is a well-built epilator. After using it about 4-5 times it&#x27;s truly an efficient product! It grabs even the finest hairs you don&#x27;t really notice, it does a good job grabbing the smaller hairs just poking out. However, you might have to go over short hair areas a couple times. One of the issues I have with the epilator is that the light turns on every time you start the epilator. I would like if I had the option of switching it on since I don&#x27;t always need it on and it just wastes the battery. Despite that, the light is still useful at putting the smaller hairs in view. My hair grows back within 2ish weeks. Hair growth really depends on the person, also it&#x27;s important to remember that the cell hair growths are all in different cycles.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of power, I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it yet. I get what I need done with it still having juice. The caps that this comes with is not all useful, to me at least. I only use the main one along with the efficiency cap. I tried the facial cap but it really didn&#x27;t pick up anything, the cap I feel is too thick for the tweezers to reach the hairs. Shaver head and trimmer head are useful if you like to shave and keep places trimmed. The main cap just gets things done quicker and to me less painful than the efficiency cap. If you just want to epilate quickly use the efficiency cap, the cap is a lot thinner so the tweezers are able to reach the hairs better. Cleaning is simple with a handy dandy little brush and you could even wash the hairs off. I&#x27;ve used the epilator in my shower before and it works with hairs that are a bit longer but not extremely well since hairs stick to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;*I haven&#x27;t used it in the bath, but I think a useful tip is to submerge the area you want in water and epilate it underwater, that way the hairs aren&#x27;t sticking to your skin and are lifted up by the water.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t waxed or plucked your hairs before then it will hurt. How much? it depends on your pain tolerance, but keep in mind after a few uses it will hurt but gradually you will be able to tolerate the pain. The most painful spot for me is doing my upper lip, but I&#x27;m starting to get use to it. It will be red for a few hours so I would recommend epilating at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this product. It works, it&#x27;s efficient and looks like it will last for a long time!th, but I think a useful tip is to submerge the area you want in water and epilate it underwater, that way the hairs aren&#x27;t sticking to your skin and are lifted up by the water.&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t waxed or plucked your hairs before then it will hurt.

    <li> I&#x27;ve waxed for years and had laster on legs and underarms in the past which does not last forever.  This worked well and I didn&#x27;t find it more than mildly uncomfortable at times. I did not use on facial or bikini areas</li>
    <li> Great!  I stings a little at first, but I adapted pretty quickly.  Afer several shaves it really does change the texture and thickness of the hair, and you don&#x27;t have to shave nearly as often.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It is better than shaving for my legs, underarms, and bikini line.  Works on face, but mostly on fine hairs.</li>
    <li> I needed a new epilator to grab the smaller finer hairs off my legs. This works perfectly! I use my panasonic one in the shower and this one one the hairs that the other one misses. It&#x27;s actually less painful since the massaging feature distracts you from the pulling of the hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was easy, fast, and very efficient.  It took weeks for hair to regrow.  I found it ever so much better than my old shaver.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t pick the thinny hair</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever had!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright.. doesn&#x27;t pick up all the hairs unless you go over the same section ten million times. You would still need to use this plus shaving.</li>
    <li> Very nice , it was in a very good shape , ladys love it ,I recommend  it to every one</li>
    <li> Best epilator I have ever had: not as painful as others, not noisy. I also love the light and the fact that it is cordless and the attachments!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in time and it&#x27;s working as expected. The only thing which could have been added by the supplier/producer in this item pack is the point of charging. The present charging point is useful in US only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s experience with the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 4 years; the shaving head is perfect and absolutely doesn&#x27;t harm the skin... However, I&#x27;ve been using the tweezers on my legs below the knees and I found it relatively efficient as long as it concerns the looks (you can get the smooth feeling only when you use a pin to pull out the ingrown hairs). The first time hurts but then, as the hairs don&#x27;t grow all at once, they become weaker and easier to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, some hairs end up cut rather than plucked so I used it almost every other day. The thing which I didn&#x27;t like was that I started having many ingrown hairs in the deepest layer of my skin looking like small white greyish spots, which I kept on squeezing until they bled, bcoz you can&#x27;t take them out with a pin like you do the normal ingrown hairs, and they left white marks as you can see in the pics attached. I think it would take time for these spots to vanish.... I&#x27;ve heard this problem from many people using the tweezers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used it in the bathroom so can&#x27;t say anything about that. The battery lasts for about half an hour, more or less. and it charges within an hour or so. The performance is perfect till now.. hope you guys find this helpful!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Every attachment is very useful. It reduces hair growth significantly. I am glad I chose this product</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever for hair removal!!!  Had I known about Braun sooner, I would not have wasted my time and money on razors.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Not hurt.</li>
    <li> Is it legal to quote Phoebe and Monica from Friends when they tried the Waxeene? I want to use their words &amp;#34;mind numbingly dumb&amp;#34; came to mind. First of all a semi botched surgery left me with little to no feeling under my right arm-pit... good place to test something painful right? I mean whenever I wax my armpits and the waxer starts on my right, I&#x27;m never really sure if this is a painful procedure or not... till she moves to the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This torture... I mean epilator was no different. I&#x27;m sorry, WHEN will the &amp;#34;massaging&amp;#34; take place? Kind of hard to tell over all the pain. I feel like I just paid $100 for a razor, because that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll be using it from now on, with the guard. those evil things aren&#x27;t getting near me ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the 2 rating is more about my experience than the product. The product is exactly as it says. I like the nice bright light. The fact that it can be used wet or dry, but how do I FEEL about it???? I really want to give it a negative 1... I would rather go back to paying the spa lady the price of this for a one time wax... but that&#x27;s just my experience.</li>
    <li> This item is great.  The pain is not too bad. I have only used it for my legs.  I will never shave again.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, charge lasts for a full epilation. Little bit noisy but nothing to worry about. It hurts a lot the first time but for the second chance you start getting used to the pain. Better use it often to remove the hair that is left behind and keep up-to-date (to avoid painful experiences when all hair has grown up again).</li>
    <li> bought if for the wife, she tried it several times and she has very sensitive skin and it just hurt her to bad, so i had to return in to AMAZON, which was amazingly easy to do!!!!!!  so give it a try and if it doesn&#x27;t work just exchange it. to easy!</li>
    <li> For those of us who have never used an epilator before, this model is a great one to start with. It has massaging heads and various other features (such as the ability to use it in the bath) that are designed to make epilation less painful. That said, holeeeee cow! Epilation the first time is painful! The second time is MUCH less painful, if you keep the epilation up and do it every month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips to make your first epilation as comfortable as possible:&lt;br /&gt;1. Shave right now! As soon as you order this device, so that when you get it you will only have short hairs. Just like in waxing, long hairs are brutally painful. And if your hair hasn&#x27;t grown out much by the time you get it, great! You will be able to epilate gradually as your hair grows in... Just epilate every two or three days for a week or two to catch all the hairs as they grow in. That would be so much less painful than the way I did it: going after long hairs and short all at once.&lt;br /&gt;2. Get yourself some tasty sweets. Studies have shown that sweets on the tongue actually reduce the sensation of pain.&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t use any of the optional caps if you&#x27;re doing your legs. They won&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a very careful study of all do the models available on amazon.com and this one had every single useful feature available except one: you cannot use shave gel or cream with it when you are using it under water or in the shower. To me, it was worth the trade off to get the massaging head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend epilation now as a hair removal method because (after the first one), it is less painful, less expensive and more convenient than waxing. It lasts much longer than shaving and you never get nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Braun Silk Epil 7 because it is loaded with every single feature but one that you could ever want in an epilator. And so far, the quality is good. I will change my review if anything bad happens in its performance.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works perfectly. Not sure if it is great for the pits though.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t wait to try it once receiving this epilator. I hadn&#x27;t used this kind of method to clean my armpit hair for around 10 years. I thought I would feel extremely painful like people said. But surprised. Painful, yes, but I still can handle this level of &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I remember 10 years ago when I used an epilator which was a Japan brand, I felt painful like hell at that time, and that Japan brand could not clamp my every single hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;This Braun one not only eases me with less pain feeling, also cleans my armpit hair completely.  I hardly believe an epilator could do all these after that Japan brand.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased - I did a lot of research before choosing this model - it kept coming down to Braun and between this one and the new one with the scrubber - I wanted one that was both for wet and dry use and also one that could be used on the face - most of the reviews I read and videos on youtube - it didn&#x27;t seem like the scrubber did to much and this one came with more attachments so I decided that I would get this one and buy the clarisonic separately.  I tried epilating 20 something years ago and it was extremely painful so I never tried it again - I must say that the massagers on this machine make a huge difference it is uncomfortable but not painful - I also purchased a tria laser hair removal I had intended on epilating and using the laser - come to find out you cant do both.  so I will use this for the lighter hairs like on the upper arms and different areas that the laser will not pick up - but now I am even more glad that I got this model because you have to shave before you can use the laser and this model has the trimmer attachment that I can use on my chin and upper lip and it is just as close as a shave but really didn&#x27;t want to shave my face for fear it would make the hair come back thicker - last thing I need lol! I have only charged the battery one time and have used this all over my body and it still has battery left - I am actually very impressed with how quickly this works and how comfortable it actually is - of course some areas are more sensitive than others but it is a 1000 times better than the epilady of 20 years ago!  it is also a very nice design and feels good in your hand and is easy to maneuver even when trying to get the back of the legs and behind the knee area - all in all if this one lasted me 6 months and then something happened to it - I would probably buy another one</li>
    <li> It was gift for my daughter. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I had earlier version of the Brun silk-épil but this one is sooo much better. I haven&#x27;t use it under running water so far but on dry mode it is fast very precise and I love love the smartlight. I have used every single attachment and they do their work just fine. I&#x27;m not dying to use it on wet mode I guess I&#x27;m afraid it wont last as much but give me time...</li>
    <li> Purchased this great machine for my wife, and she loved it so much. It works noiseless and all caps are useful, as well as the wipes are very soft and really awesome when she uses them.</li>
    <li> This thing is a lifesaver! Fast, no mess to put up with (compared to wax strips and the like measures), and no cuts/pinches like some cheaper models inflict. The nice-smelling wipes they send along are worthless when it comes to numbing pain though - the &amp;#34;ouchness scale&amp;#34; of using this machine is about 9 on the scale of 1-10 if you are a first-time user, and using the wipes does nothing to minimize it. If you are a chicken for pain, you may want to tweeze or wax the area first, and use this device on it next time around because it picks each hair individually, and that seems to magnify pain for each tiny spot - can be very irritating if you are not used to it. It does do an excellent job and picks out literally everything, so you never have to endure the &amp;#34;prickly ugly stage&amp;#34; waiting for hair to be long enough to be able to get rid of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the first Silk-epil Braun designed for years and wanted a second one for travel. It&#x27;s been redesigned and this new one is cordless, which I like. It does a nice job, but the head part is a little broader than the original, and I actually like the older design a little better. It is also a shaver, which works well for a quick underarm cleanup. Really, you can&#x27;t beat these Braun epliators -- they work great. If you find it painful, give it a little time. The first few times may sting a little, but after that, you won&#x27;t notice any pull.</li>
    <li> I am a guy so obviously it was not for me but my wife loves this and this is the first time she has used an epilator and after reading lot of reviews on amazon and such we decided on this. I don&#x27;t really have much to write about this.&lt;br /&gt;She likes the fact it can be used in shower which makes the process less painful (for those who feel pain while using this)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and horrifying all at the same time, simply bc it&#x27;s going to do what you want it to do, but you also now that it&#x27;s going to hurt...and looking at the rotating tweezer-like things is like a bad dream...but it&#x27;s not that bad :) Didn&#x27;t hurt too much on the legs and the tweezer things are more threatening visually. The armpits and bikini area is absolutely painful and I felt as if I was begging for my life. Nice long effects though and a little blood, but I was ready for that. A great purchase for the not so faint of heart :)</li>
    <li> I do not prticularly like this unit. I had the original Epilady and it was far better.&lt;br /&gt;This unit seems to cut the hair rather tha remove them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this epilator! I have owned other epilators before but this has to be the best one yet. It gets all the tiny little hairs, I don&#x27;t have to worry about missing any hairs, the light on this is really bright so it lets you see everything that other epilators don&#x27;t. Now, I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it does hurt a bit, but I guess over the years I have built up a tolerance to the pain. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is tired of shaving all the time, with this I only have to use every 3 to 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Recommend spend good money for good item if you don&#x27;t like waist time. Amazon is the best give me good discount for this item. With no cost for shipping. Fast as usual. I order before from drugstore but then I cancel and reorder from amazon. You never can go wrong with amazon. About Braun - it&#x27;s always good quality. This is my second epilator. First I bot chip emjoy. It&#x27;s junk. Braking hair no good. Braun is one of the best so far. If you do it first time user give about a 3weeks to see difference. Hair will brake just because it&#x27;s to thick. after shaving it will get better and it&#x27;s start to grow as nice and soft hair. Which easy to shave and make every body happy.  Good luck. I was ready to give up at first. But This one make differents</li>
    <li> Incredible painful, it felt like I was running a knife along my leg. Obviously ripping your hair out is not going to be comfortable. This product felt like torture. Unfortunately, with this product the slow horrible pain combined with the unsettling buzzing made my experience agonising. So I returned itand will stick with waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on a side note, I feel like this would be great for torturing someone.  You could put them through immense pain while leaving no proof of the crime...</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with an epilator &amp; I&#x27;m a big fan. The Braun is easy to use &amp; clean. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> What everyone says is right.  At first it&#x27;s bloody murder for some, and not so bad for others.  After a few uses:  it&#x27;s still bloody murder and not so bad for others.  Using it takes a while no matter where.  The whole exfoliating bonanza/regimen that is required after using this thing is more of a &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; than anything.</li>
    <li> LOVE this epilator! Back in the day, I used the &amp;#34;Epi Lady&amp;#34; which hurt *a lot* and wasn&#x27;t real effective at hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun SE7681 is WONDERFUL....it hardly hurts, more like a buzzy sensation, not pain. I use it on my legs, arms, and even my face! The different attachments accommodate those different areas. The hair that is growing back is much finer and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of advice: Be sure to exfoliate on a regular basis, to prevent ingrown hairs. That practice is win-win, that helps your skin anyway.</li>
    <li> DONT BUY IT&lt;br /&gt;IT BROKE AFTER 3 TIMES OF USE</li>
    <li> So far I have used it twice..I used it on my legs and it worked very well, only a slight prickly feeling that immediately went away once I was finished.  I used it again on my underarms and the sensation was much stronger, but not unbearable.  The hairs are removed quickly and leave the area smooth.  I haven&#x27;t used the electric razor/trimmer attachments yet but I am sure I will be pleased.</li>
    <li> A little painful but gets work done and is rather easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works well. Good products.</li>
    <li> Honestly and undoubtedly, epilating is the equivalent of a thousand bee stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For first timers, if you&#x27;re hesitant just looking at it, don&#x27;t get it. If you&#x27;re very \\&quot;eh\\&quot; and want to try it out because shaving legs is just a pain in the rear but are willing to take a chance, then go for it. I&#x27;m not going to put the pain within this product, because all epilators do the exact same thing: rip your hair out with the root. I can&#x27;t be convinced that more/less tweezers would aid in any sort of pain de/increase. It&#x27;s not the machine, it&#x27;s the act and concept!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first epilator, and I don&#x27;t have a high pain tolerance, I&#x27;m a regular softie, and it&#x27;s UNCOMFORTABLE at first, like I said, it&#x27;s like bee stings. I shaved a few days before I ordered this, and it got here about a week later, so there was a bit of growth when I started. After a while, though, you really do just get used to it. You don&#x27;t grow to LIKE it, but it&#x27;s bearable, and I&#x27;m sure it just gets more and more bearable the more you do it, naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair on my legs is a bit of a mixed bag, there are some more thicker, coarser hairs, but mostly it&#x27;s light, thin hair, and I feel that there were plenty that were just broken. BUT I have never epilated before, so I expected as much, and I will keep going until my skin and hair adapt to whats going on. I tried it on my under arms, though, which is your average thick, coarse hair, and no. I got about half-way through one side, and had to stop. I will probably get around to trying it again and just do it in stages, because I like the idea of not having to worry so much about that area every 2 days, but it will take a while!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One specific thing I will comment on; the little \\&quot;massage\\&quot; head doesn&#x27;t really do much. It doesn&#x27;t make any sort of difference. Though, to defend it even though it is pretty useless, it is a pretty good guide to how much pressure to use while the epilator is in use. I&#x27;ve found that if I hold it just so it rolls against my skin, the epilation is pretty spot-on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice epilator, in the end! I chose this one after a lengthy search, it just comes with nice features (different caps, a shaver, the wet/dry options), and it&#x27;s a nice middle-ground on price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I epilated my legs the very first night I got it (August 26th), a few times here and there afterwards, and have since been just shaving my legs. Not that I don&#x27;t love epilating, I do, really (smugface)! But I have noticed a HUGE difference in the amount of hair that is actually growing back, which makes shaving THAT much easier and makes lasts at the very least, 5 solid days before noticing it growing back; and at the most, a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, depending mainly on what type of hairs you&#x27;re growing (I think I&#x27;ve mentioned, the hair on my legs differs between thick and thin), epilating once initially will at the very least will definitely make a difference in how much will come back later on. In my case, over a full month and there&#x27;s still minimal growth from, more than likely, the thinner hairs that weren&#x27;t strong enough to be plucked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I would really \\&quot;recommend\\&quot; though, is soaking at least your legs with Olive Oil after exfoliating with a good body wash. Aside from being very hydrating (I&#x27;ve got really dry skin in winter months, so Olive Oil is a healthy alternative), it has anti-inflammatory properties, which I&#x27;ve found to be super helpful with shaving (all I shave with), but more-so now from the anger that epilating has caused; in fact, after I epilated the first time and times after that, some of my pores were being stuck-up and irritated, over time and more-so most recently as I&#x27;ve started back with Olive Oil, they&#x27;ve all gone back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few things to maybe keep in mind :)the epilation is pretty spot-on!    Very nice epilator, in the end! I chose this one after a lengthy search, it just comes with nice features (different caps, a shaver, the wet/dry options), and it&#x27;s a nice middle-ground on price.

    <li> Love it!!! Worth buying!</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;However, the epilator part does not get all the hair. Have to go over the same part twice or thrice (even the hair length is same all over my legs) and even then I have to use the shaver parr to get rid of the same length hair that is not picked up by the epilator.</li>
    <li> Shaving is in the past!  This wet-dry epilator is effective and comfortable to use.  I am enjoying all of its features, and I am very pleased with this purchase.  The epilator arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I really hate this epilator. I haven&#x27;t bought an epilator since maybe 2008? My old one was working fine, but I decided to invest in a new one and opted for this one.  I bought it because it was cordless, had a light, and could be used in the water - all things my old Bruan one couldn&#x27;t do.  I tried to use it once in the shower, haven&#x27;t used it since... It just didn&#x27;t work for me. The light is completely useless and dumb. The charge does not get me through my legs and arms.... and you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging, which is also dumb.  The epilator functionality is fine, but it works just as well as my old one, but way more expensive.  Since I bought my new one, my old one stopped working, so I&#x27;m going to buy another one. Definitely open to suggestions!</li>
    <li> Good product and effective but a tad painful after the first couple of uses. I’m finally used to the tiny stings from the hairs being plucked out at the speed of light. LOL Overall I’m quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as much power.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if I wanted to endure the pain that is using an Epilator, but a friend convinced me that it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to it. So I thought I would try. This is the model she recommended and I must say, I&#x27;m glad she did. It beats the heck out of paying someone to wax my lip and shaving is out because of the stubble it leaves. You do get used to the feel of using it and it does a fantastic job. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> It is not as effective as epilator, leaves a lot of hair and need to redo one area a lot of times. I did not get any massaging unit with it as shown before buying. the massaging attachment was included in the package that I bought but not in the one I received. .Other than that it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;It causes much less pain than my original epiliator, but hurts a lot on face, can&#x27;t even think of using in underarms area.</li>
    <li> She loves it, said it doe&#x27;s a much better job than her tweezy. Mentioned she really love the lite so she can see the finer hairs. Bottom line she loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought epilators for couple years and this one is the best on thus far. Leaves your skin clean, smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because, I had a Panasonic it was great. I bought this Braun se 7681, just because it has a good review. But in realalty it&#x27;s not that great. Berttery life so short. I&#x27;m not its brand new. It come in box of Braun</li>
    <li> I was given this as a gift from my husband, and I simply love it. I t is really convenient to use. I had used first generation Braun, and it was really painful. I wasn&#x27;t sure to buy another one with that kinda experience. To my pleasant surprise this isn&#x27;t so much painful , esp with the massager heads on. It does depend on the area one is working on. Like arms are pretty easy, legs too are fine. The only little pain is in underarms and areas having long hair.&lt;br /&gt;So , like everyone has said, trim your hair before epilating to have minimal pain (Don&#x27;t shave! as this will hurt more , go for waxing and epilate after a week or some 10 days when you have very little growth).&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find the attachments very useful, but massager head is great. Overall, a useful product, esp when u plan to wear something for an unplanned event, and then you have Silk epil to your rescue , providing the ease of epilating anywhere, even while sitting in the car while your hubby is driving :)</li>
    <li> I use this straight out of the shower on dry skin on my legs once a week or so, around every ten days and its awesome.  Straight out of the shower my skin is soft and the process is pretty painless.</li>
    <li> I got this epilator for my armpit tattoos, it works great!!! nothing compared to the razor which at the next days made me want to scratch and caused irritation. With the silk epil 7 I DON&#x27;T FEEL THE ITCHY ARMPIT ANYMORE. Also i tried down there and yes... it hurts like hell, and the itchy is still there but i must say is much less than using a razor, aso less dangerous. I won&#x27;t deny the first time i grabbed my skin :( ouch! but i learned fast and with no fear i keep using it and everytime he pain is less and less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For men or women if you want t try down there i strongly recommend you to trim the fur previously using the shaver head with the translucid trimer attachment. Once the hair is shorter the pain would be less intense too, but as i said with the time you just get used to it and there is no more fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain? yes, there is pain.&lt;br /&gt;Results? BIG YES, you won&#x27;t be happier and maybe your wife/husband either :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the cheaper epilators work as well but i didn&#x27;t want to take the risk and i chose this one because it is also a shaver and trimer which for men ise very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for men the white option is the one we really need, no need for the spa one, this one including all the attachments is the perfect choice for men who want to take care of the fur.</li>
    <li> This is great. Charge lasts for two or more uses of entire body. Have been using it for a year now and works like new!</li>
    <li> AMAZING !!!! LOVE IT.. GETS THE JOB WELL DONE</li>
    <li> The product is good and effective although the battery life is poor and you need to charge it too frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for two star is not the performance nor the battery life. Its because the epilator head of the product is not covered under the warranty and the customer care of braun is quite frustrating to deal with. There is no proper system of response for issues and they direct (by giving their phone number) you to a local agent for issue of repair etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My epilator head stopped working and the battery of the unit is getting discharged the moment I try to use a fully charged unit (quite frustrating). Even after having a good product they seem to fail on service. :(</li>
    <li> One complaint - I didn&#x27;t receive the correct electricity plug for our&lt;br /&gt;Australian power point.  Otherwise I am very happy with the appliance so far.</li>
    <li> I previously had philips epilator, which used to remove the hair neatly. Braun epilator pains a lot and it creates rashes after epilating. It is said that it works in wet and dry, but it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair properly while the arms are wet.</li>
    <li> Amazing, little pain but very tolerable and results are fabulous. Would highly recommend it. Recouped the cost in just 4 weeks</li>
    <li> Thanks Braun and Bzzagent for allowing me to review this product! I couldn&#x27;t wait to try out this epilator as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my old epilator. For those who are not familiar with epilators, the Braun series 7 epilator is one of Braun&#x27;s more expensive products that has added features to make sure that the device is relatively easy and painless to use. The massaging cap and built in light make it so much easier to spot tiny hairs and epilate without too much pain.  This product has two speed settings and several attachment heads that can be used depending on the area that needs to be epilated. I would recommend using the lowest setting on areas like the legs or arms, where there is generally thicker hair and more hair growth. In this way, the epilator can grab the hair from the root without breakage. So far, I have only used the sensitive area cap and the shaver cap. The razor is wonderful; you could just use this product for the razor attachment to be honest. I have never had a smoother shave! The sensitive area cap is not as effective at grabbing hairs compared to the regular epilator without a cap. I actually preferred not using a cap for my legs and bikini area. The charge lasts a fairly long time with this epilator. After plugging it into the outlet, it had full charge within an hour. After doing both my legs and armpits (approx. 40 minutes) , it was still working which was great! Overall, I am really impressed with this product! It is easy enough to use for beginners, but also advanced enough with multiple features that long time users can also enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips and Tricks for People New to Epilating:&lt;br /&gt;- Epilating for the first time will definitely be painful, but I promise the pain will lessen after a few uses! Try numbing cream or taking a painkiller 30 minutes before epilating if you have a very low pain threshold.&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate! Exfoliate with a good scrub before and after epilating to prevent ingrown hairs. This is so important. Unless you want to manually pluck every in grown hair out, you need to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;-Use aloe vera gel or another type of soothing ointment after epilating. It can really calm down the redness and irritation that happens after epilation.&lt;br /&gt;-Applying baby powder onto the areas that you are about to epilate can help dry up any excess water or residue that is left on the skin. It&#x27;s easier for the device to grab dry hairs vs wet hairs.&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure that your hair is the correct length before epilating. I think the optimal length is 2mm-5mm. When the hairs are too long, their is a lot of breakage and left over stubble, which defeats the purpose of using an epilator haha.</li>
    <li> Its great thing!! I use it first time and it amazing!!!! Now i&#x27;ll never exchange it on smth else</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy that got sick of the continuous bumps I got on the &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; of my neck when shaving. I considered laser treatments just to get some relief. I decided to try epilating first and I&#x27;m glad I did. I would have given it five start except for these two things:&lt;br /&gt;1. It hurts like crazy... I have to muster all of my manliness to use it on the super sensitive skin on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t grab/eliminate all hairs regardless of length first time around. One still have to eventually shave to get rid of everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first found that even when using this, it made my bumps even more monstrous and it looked like I had a rash on my neck for a week. After that week, it was nice. Soft skin and no irradiation, but this wasn&#x27;t looking like it would be MY solution. I stumbled on something that made it tolerable. Use Retinol cream (OTC) after first using and a few days afterwards. This cured the bump/rash issue down to nearly nothing. This combination is the bomb for my sensitive skin on my neck. Now, if I could just get rid of the pain in the epilating process.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt so much and the results are amazing. I advice it</li>
    <li> its a great epilator, I have been using the silk epil epilators for years. My friend had the 7 and after a little while she started having problem with her batterie. I found out that all the 7 had this kind of issue, so i decided to wait a year to buy just so the newer production would fix the problem. they didn&#x27;t. after 12months i have to send it in because the battery won&#x27;t last more than 5mn.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s not down play here, this thing freaking hurts the first couple times.  HOWEVER, once you get used to what to expect and use on a frequent basis (about once per week)... this is a god-send!!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I had to look it back up online to make sure I wasn&#x27;t doing something incorrect... yes, it hurt that bad.  I have a bad tattoo fetish, so even for this high pain tolerance girl, I was quite challenged.  If you can make it through your first round... kudos to you for joining the club!</li>
    <li> It hurt under my arms, but my legs weren&#x27;t so bad. Some redness and bumps after, but it went away after a while. Holds a charge well and easy to clean. My thick black hairs grew back a little after 1 week and was noticeably thinner.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product or brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months and it dies within 10 minutes of using it. I&#x27;ve tried contacting Bruan to get a replacement or refund but they refuse to fix the problem with their product.</li>
    <li> Love that thing. easy to use. does  a great job for it is meant to do. I love being able to use it without a cord. I love that I can use it under water, on wet and on dry skin. I love the numerous attachments for different areas of the body. Very very happy with that purchase. A great improvement from the last silk epil I had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m realy happy about it!</li>
    <li> I have been epilating for 25 years.  I blew up my last epilator in Australia with the wrong current, hence I needed to buy a new one.  This one is ok and has lots of options/attachments but it doesn&#x27;t really remove the hair as good as prior epilators.  Save your money and buy a cheaper model.</li>
    <li> Love this product,though slightly painful, does an awesome job. Saves me money and time. Takes a while to remove very thin hair but so far it has been working fine. Hope, it doesn&#x27;t quit on me like my previous Braun epilator/like how some of the reviews mentioned it stops working(which was the same problem I experienced with my old Braun epil).</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that I am a 55 year old male who hates body hair. I would have to shave daily from toes to chin. I wanted to free up my grooming time some so I started looking into epilators. I purchased the Braun Silk-epil 7 and let my body hair grow out to the recommended length. I started with my toes and legs first, using the slow setting. I found the key to the best performance is to keep the skin tight and go very slow. I won&#x27;t call it pain but there was discomfort, but I kept the goal in mind. I did have some red bumps on parts of my legs but they went away within a day. One week later, I could feel a little stubble on my legs so I turned it the higher speed and redid my legs. No red bumps and much less discomfort, and my legs are pretty smooth after 2 weeks. I also used it on my chest, underarms, and buttocks and as much of my back as I could reach. Some red bumps again but didn&#x27;t last long. The first use on my underarms the discomfort was intense, so again, I had to keep in mind the end goal. As far as bikini line or pubes, that&#x27;s pain. I am working a little at a time in this area to see if over time the pain is lessened over time. I discovered that soaking in a hot bath helps a lot, allowing the skin to relax and the hairs releasing easier. I have also found that using sesame oil after epilating reduces the red bumps quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using  SE 7781 for three years before i went to visit my sister overseas and she liked it so much that i left it for her and bought this one for me. As much as SE7781 and SE768 look alike they do perform a little bit differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all the shaving attachment on SE7781 stopped working in a little bit over a year with very rear use. I found a replacement on a UK website for $54+Shipping. Since i did not use it that much i did not bother. It did perform well though i did not like the charging feature - i don&#x27;t like to depend on the charge vs just plugging it in and using for as long as i want. It did a good job at pulling the fine hair out and the light helps a lot as well since i&#x27;ve using epilators for over 12 years and my hair grows really fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SE7681 is even better for pulling out fine hair while being more gentle and causing less pain. But it does not such a good job with the longer hair. Also it catches skin more easily when epilating underarms or under knees - ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line - while it is not perfect and has it&#x27;s cons i still find it one of the best epilator on the market and highly recommend it to newbies because the process is very painful when you switch from shaving.</li>
    <li> This is the first Epilator I have ever used. I went through several reviews on Amazon before purchasing this product and I am very happy with it. I am used to waxing my hair off for the last several years, may be because of that my pain threshold is higher. The pain is a bit more than waxing.  A tip would be to NOT press it hard and not making slow movements. A &amp;#34;Swoosh&amp;#34; movement is better and makes the hair come off easy. My hair growth has considerably reduced with its usage and i just need to use it once a month now. It also makes your skin smoother than it was. I am giving it 4 stars beacuse the facial epilation head for me is not really working. I have very small and fine hairs and it pains like HELL using it on the face, a definite no-no for me. Over All a Totally worth it product!</li>
    <li> Love this! finally a product that works!</li>
    <li> Ouch! But works as listed. It was a Christmas gift and has gotten use by the three women of the house at least once. It&#x27;s supposed to yank the hair out and that&#x27;s what it does. No problem with delivery at all. It was delivered in a timely manner. If yanking out your hair by the short and curlies is your aim, this is the proper tool.</li>
    <li> Works well on my hag hairs that grow randomly on my chin, but it isn&#x27;t pleasant. However, I&#x27;m not getting ingrown hairs from it like I do when I use regular tweezers.</li>
    <li> Very good epilator. My skin feels really smooth after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use it on clean, well exfoliated skin.</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve had. Vibrating feature keeps it from hurting so much. Light helps you see ones missed. Well worth a little more money to get this one.</li>
    <li> I ordered two epilators, the first time you sent all the parts which came with it, the second one I ordered, it came with missing the cover on the blade and it came with nothing, I spent about $250 on both and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the second order.</li>
    <li> The battery life started out great, became unusable.  Two months later battery dies after ten minutes of use.</li>
    <li> I blew out the motor on my very old model, which I loved, but I plugged it in in Bangkok - big mistake.  I didn&#x27;t think this new one would be as good as the first - with the plastic tweezer tips.  The old one was metal.  It does work very well, though.</li>
    <li> Bought it in Nov 2014. In 3 months time, the blade started to act weird, On calling the customer support, they did not show interest to resolve the issue. They kept telling replacing the blade is not covered under warranty, but they would do a favor on me. I did not like the customer service at all.</li>
    <li> This little machine does a good job and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would. It doesn&#x27;t remove the little facial hairs as well as I hoped though. I like that it also has a shaver attachment.</li>
    <li> My wife is happy, so i&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
    <li> it is realy perfect , I have used many types before but this one is the queen of  all of them .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two years! I&#x27;m pretty diligent about cleaning it, and it&#x27;s been working great for the whole time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a ton of more in depth positive reviews, but I just wanted to add my 5-star review into the mix!</li>
    <li> I used it both wet and dry. I highly recommend this device. Wet use was more comfortable and pain-free. The result was almost similar to wax.</li>
    <li> Wet and dry and cordless functionalities are good to have. I would be happier to pay this price if the epilation worked great. Silk Epil 5318 did a much better job of epilating . It seems like the new one does not pluck the hair completely or breaks the hair while plucking. This leaves me unsatisfied with the product. Also, since the hair is not completely removed, they grow back faster than after use of my Silk Epil 5318. I am glad to have the old one still working. I would probably go back a couple series and get the older version of Silk epil or look at other brands until I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Good product, I recommend!</li>
    <li> It works great. Did not feel very painful on hands and legs, but lot of pain for underarms.</li>
    <li> Pulled some hair out by the root.  Unfortunately, the device broke a lot of hairs which resulted in in-grown hairs.  Not fun to treat or a good look for a cyclist.  Prep and aftercare was done according to directions.</li>
    <li> Item as described, arrived on time, works perfectly.</li>
    <li> When I use the epilator part the battery only last at most for 30 mins. That barely enough time to do half of one leg. It takes too long to pull all the hairs out and it says it can take the smallest hair out (compares it to the size of a grain of sand) which is the biggest lie. Hairs have to be medium length in order to get them all. Its some what painful of course but you do get used to it. I do not recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Product is great... works very good!</li>
    <li> Not as good as ppl say. I use it on my legs, and hair grows back pretty quick. It does not hurt at all though. It hurts a little if you use it on arm pits. But it grows back pretty quick there too!</li>
    <li> My comments goes for men only. Please do not waste your money...Who really can stand the pain for using this product?!!!!</li>
    <li> I used Emjoi Light Caress Rechargeable Epilator for almost 6 years and I think it&#x27;s about time I have to say goodbye. I owned another Emjoi prior to this one but I lost it. I decided to try some thing new and I picked Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator because of the review. First impression after the fast shipment was great. It looks good, not cheaply made. I also would like to try the wet and dry option. I normally use it for underarm and have never tried it with wet option. First time I tried, used it after the epilator wipes that came with the box. A few seconds after I move the machine around the area, it pulled my skin into the epilator and the machine froze. I turned it off and pulled my skin out, of course it hurts! It bruised my armpit! Okay... I&#x27;ll give it a try for a wet option, thank god no more pain but it doesn&#x27;t really did a good job. I think my hair has a perfect length and it should clean up well. Well, disappointed and it&#x27;s on the way back. I&#x27;m going back to Emjoi.</li>
    <li> It comes as a European charge system. Which means it does not work at all until I find some type of an  adapter.&lt;br /&gt;This is not mentioned at all in either the amazon write up or the things documentation.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I was a bit nervous about ordering an epilator because I have memories of trying my Aunt&#x27;s Epilady when I was younger and I remember how much that hurt.  This little guy gets the job done with little to no pain.  The first use is the worst but you get use to it and it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything now.  I will say that I still feel stubbly because the hairs grow at different rates but my legs look smooth...so if I want that really smooth leg for date night I have to epilate the day before followed by a shave the day of the date.</li>
    <li> Like some of the other reviews say \\&quot;it hurts like a b*%$h\\&quot;.  Over time, you really have to build up your pain tolerance.</li>
    <li> I got this epilator a year ago - initially I was very happy with my purchase. However, I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because after using it for a year, the battery has stopped charging. I put it in the charger and use it for about five minutes, and the red light goes on indicating that it needs to be charged. Considering that this machine cost me 100 dollars, I plan on buying a different brand to replace this one.</li>
    <li> It feels good in my hand. Does a good job of removing all longer hairs with minimal discomfort. It leaves only small fine hairs, which are basically invisible.</li>
    <li> Just used it 3-4 times and it quit working. The battery is good for a few uses only. I called braun and they said they will repair it but were not willing to replace or repair. I do not want to get a defective item fixed. They don&#x27;t even provide a shipping label. Horrible customer service.</li>
    <li> Bought this two weeks ago and one of the best investments yet. I used it only dry so far on my arms and armpits. It removed the most finest hairs I had. This epilator was a little more painful than the other epilator I tried but as long as you have a strong pain tolerance, it&#x27;s easy to overcome</li>
    <li> the worst product. please do not buy it. once its turn on it wouldnt turn off no matter what u do. it hurts when you use this product.</li>
    <li> Like every other reviewer says - THIS IS EXTREMELY PAINFUL! But with that said, it works great and the results are so worth it. I&#x27;ve tried it on my underarms and bikini line so far - and although I will probably never try it on my bikini line ever again, I use it A LOT for my underarms. It misses some hairs so I have to go over them again with a tweezer afterwards but for the most part it works perfectly. You get used to the pain and it&#x27;s cheaper than constantly going to get waxed. I would recommend this, but I will say you have to be very brave to try this!</li>
    <li> This product us amazing. Once you get the hang of it and used to the sensation it is very versatile abd efficient. Much cheaper than waxing and superior to shaving!</li>
    <li> Excellent product at very good price, strongly recommended, removes hair from the roots, prevents regrowth of hair for up to 3 weeks, very less pain</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product - easy to use and such a money saver compared to waxing. I recommend waxing your legs first and then using this for the first time once your leg hair begins to grow out, as it&#x27;s MUCH less painful. Then you can continue to use the epilady instead of shaving and waxing. That&#x27;s what I did and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all and was so quick and easy because I wasn&#x27;t attempting to tackle an entire leg of shaving grow out. I have only used it dry, as the other reviews weren&#x27;t as great for wet use. I definitely recommend - it&#x27;s a game changer!!!! I have been waxing for years and am so excited to end the expense of having it done professionally and all the mess and clean up involved when I do it myself. This is so easy!!!</li>
    <li> I decided on this Braun because of the 5 interchangeable heads and the fact it was waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars because it works amazingly well. The first thing I did was the hair on my arms and to answer the big question..yes it does hurt. With that out of the way I will say it is a tolerable pain and you just have to move past it because in a minute or two the pain is not noticeable anymore and you will be gliding freely over the entire area.&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this to any woman who is even considering an epilator. This particular unit comes with a trimmer and an electric shaver which are both as equally nice as the epilator portion itself. It also contains Oil of Olay epilator wipes to treat your skin prior to use. As for using this product on your face I will have to work up to that but its possible. The tweezing action is gentle so I don&#x27;t see it causing any damage. I know there are other epilators that offer more tweezers blades but I find the 40 is plenty.&lt;br /&gt;I had enquired about a warranty on this product which was not answered but after purchasing I was able to find a one year warranty which does not cover accidents. So as long as you don&#x27;t damage it from misuse or dropping ect it will be covered.</li>
    <li> I love using this product to remove body hair. The attached light helps a lot to see even the smallest hair to remove. It is a bit painful at first removal session. But it gets far more comfortable after second - third time of removing hair. Cleaning after hair removal is also very easy and it gets fully charged quickly. I can use it even in my shower. It really met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great product but I barely use it since my skin is very sensitive. I prefer wax rather than epilator but if you are used already to epilate then this is a great buy!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try an epilator for years but haven&#x27;t because I was scared of the pain. I finally bit the bullet and bought this epilator because it was the best on the market. First of all it does hurt. I was unable to do my bikini area. I successfully epilated one armpit and half of the other one. The armpits hurt pretty bad but in small doses I could handle it. However, my armpits hurt for a couple days after epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m only giving 2 stars is that it does not remove all the hair off of the legs. Epilating my legs was not so bad, it did hurt a bit was very tolerable. As a background I&#x27;ve never waxed and I shave daily but I do not have thick hair. I tried to epilate my legs the day after shaving them and I was able to get some hair but not all. I thought that maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t long enough so I waited another day. I epilated one leg for 2 hours.  I was still unable to remove all of the hair off the leg. It felt like there was a stubble and my legs were not smooth like they are after shaving. Also the epilator did not hold the charge for 2 hours so I had to recharge about every hour. 4 hours later and both legs are epilated but both have stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that I&#x27;d be able to save some time each morning and just be able to epilate weekly, but for the amount of time I spent epilating and not even getting all of my hair removed was not worth it. If you want silky smooth legs, stick to shaving and save your money. I&#x27;ll be cleaning the device and listing it on ebay because it&#x27;s worthless for me.</li>
    <li> The Braun SE7681 Silk-Epil Wet and Dry Epilator is as good of an epilator as you can get. It offers an assortment of attachments to help you with the various grooming chores associated with this device. It has a built in light that is stunningly brilliant, and the battery life is excellent. This is not a picky epilator at all, it will handle even the smallest of hairs, hair so short other brands would miss them altogether. While there is a discomfort factor when using the device, until you become accustomed to it, that is a problem with the person using it, not the device itself, so if you couldn&#x27;t handle eplilating on another brand, this one isn&#x27;t going to be some pain-free miracle device; it&#x27;s going to bother you just as much. For those that can handle the initial discomort of epilating, this is the unit to go with, hands down. It is well built, has an assortment of attachments, and the fact that it is a Braun product is reassuring that it will provide many years of trouble-free service.</li>
    <li> I have an older model of this epilator that I have used for several years. This version is virtually identical, but comes with a few extra attachments, has a different on/off switch and is cordless. It works just was well as my old one. The hair on my legs is very fine, and this has no problem getting a hold of them, even the shorter hairs. Once you get used to it, the pain is not that bad at all, at least on the legs. I have never been able to get used to using it under my arms, though. It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but it tends to snag the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to shaving.</li>
    <li> I put off trying this product as quite frankly, I was scared.  I had never used an epilator before, except for a plain old tweezer on my face.  But I hate shaving my legs, and I decided it was finally time to give it a try.  Being nervous, I read all the instructions completely several times first, and that is where I got a little confused.  The epilator comes with 5 different caps, and they are described in details with pictures, but I didn&#x27;t realize that the device as it first stands already has a cap on it.  I thought something had to go on top of what was there, and I tried in vain to put one of the other caps on, until it finally struck me it was okay to use as it was.  I charged it up, which took, as it said, about an hour, and was ready to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the enclosed lotion wipes, which I wish had come in individual packets or in a resealable pack, as I think they will dry out in time.  However, they seemed to work well!  I did my legs, and the pain, even for this first timer, was very minimal!  It felt almost just like shaving, with little tinges of pain now and then.  The booklet said to go from bottom to top of the legs, and I did that, but found to really get the hair off a few spots I had to go back and forth a little.  I loved the bright light, which showed me well where I still had work to do.  My legs now feel smoother than I&#x27;ve ever felt them!  And they don&#x27;t hurt at all, as the booklet said sometimes happens afterward.  I was quite pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the little bag that came with this, to store all the pieces, although it&#x27;s not really quite big enough if you are storing the recharging cord too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good product.  The instructions could have been a little clearer, and sometimes I think extra heads are just thrown in to make something look like it has more value.  I can&#x27;t see using them that much.  But I do think this will be my method of choice for exfolicating in the future!</li>
    <li> I reviewed the [[ASIN:B004TL9A7U Braun 7681 Silk-Epil 7 Xpressive Pro Epilator]] last year and gave it a glowing review.  When offered the [[ASIN:B0077PLNNE Braun Se7681 Silk-Epil 7681 Wet and Dry Epilator, Silver]], I assumed it would be a different product.  It&#x27;s basically the same epilator, but costs less than the former and it&#x27;s as great a product as the first!  Braun makes quality products, and this one is no exception.  As I said in my first review, the epilator is a fabulous little product that can save the expense of waxing supplies, provides great results, and is less painless than waxing when done properly.  A little trick learned from waxing, namely stretching the skin, also works for preventing excess discomfort while using the epilator, and this is less messy to boot.  It successfully removes even fine hairs and has been wonderful in keeping the skin smoother than other approaches.  The epilator arrives with various heads and some additional little moist towelettes which I have never purchased since using those included in the box.  The grooming device can be used on either wet or dry skin and because it must be charged (takes about an hour) and unplugged in order to power on, there&#x27;s no fear of electrocution.  The power cord can be removed, so you have only the epilator in your hand with nothing extra interfering as you move the device along the part of the body being groomed.  Should you want to remove hair from your body, I&#x27;d recommend the Braun epilators, regardless of which model you select.  I personally would pick this over the [[ASIN:B004TL9A7U Braun 7681 Silk-Epil 7 Xpressive Pro Epilator]] and save the additional money.This product is definitely worthy of a 5 star review!</li>
    <li> I had never tried epilation before splurging on this product, and I don&#x27;t regret it one bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty scared to try it at first, and I was convinced that the thing was cutting me (yes, it was painful) until (a) I got used to the mega-plucking sensation and (b) I realized that it caused no pain at all in the spots without hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie and say it was comfortable, but I&#x27;ve never particularly enjoyed waxing either, and I refuse to shave my arms. The money this thing will save me on waxing is well worth it, and now I don&#x27;t have to deal with the hassle of making a waxing appointment. And I am not losing anything in the bargain either, because as I said in the title, my arms feel just as smooth as they do post-wax! They were more irritated after the epilation than they usually are after waxing, but I just put some nice creamy lotion on them and the redness was completely gone within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet tried it on my armpits or bikini line, but even if I find that too painful, I am thrilled to have found an affordable and effective method for keeping my arms baby smooth.</li>
    <li> I got this product for review from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite experienced with epilators, this is my 4th and I can say Braun Silk-épil 7 experience is the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the pivoting head which allows me to remove hair in areas like under the knees (BTW even the shortest ones!).&lt;br /&gt;Another huge advantage for me was the Smartlight since my bathroom is pretty dark so I used to leave hairy spots. Well no more!&lt;br /&gt;Massage system in this epilator is really nice though I&#x27;m not so sensitive anymore, probably somebody new to epilation would appreciate it in full. And yeah, wet epilation! How was I living without that option before?!&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like is that epilator doesn&#x27;t work while charging so you have to wait until it&#x27;s fully charged. I understand that it&#x27;s because of safety reasons since it can be used wet as well. Well what can I say?! Safety first.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d surely recommend this epilator to a friend, though I find it little too pricey.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased. It gets easier with each use. I highly reccommend using numbing cream for tender areas.</li>
    <li> My epilator worked very well for 2 months, I didn&#x27;t get to use it for at least 10 times, I put it to charge from around 4 times (only when necessary). Now it takes 1 hour to charge and the battery lasts for 3 minutes and the epilator gets hot and the battery die.  I tried to return but the Amazon return policie with this product is a month. You can&#x27;t  use it while it is charging.</li>
    <li> I have used epilators for 25+ years, wearing out two Epiladys and three Emjois.  After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to try the Braun. I have used it for a few weeks now and find that it is a very good product, but not that much superior to the others I&#x27;ve used. Guess I was hoping for a miracle product that would take less time to do the job!  Still, I would highly recommend the  Silk-epil 7-- it&#x27;s nice to have the other shaving options, too. Beats razor shaving 1000%!!  :)</li>
    <li> A really satisfactory product!</li>
    <li> It works great, although in the sensitive areas the heads doesn&#x27;t work as well as I should.</li>
    <li> I like the epilator so much!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 20 years of dealing with hair one way or the other. Here&#x27;s what it comes down to:&lt;br /&gt;1. Never ever shave...pull your hair out with the root...the pain and effort will be rewarded by reducing your hairs and diminishing pain with time....every young girl should be taught that shaving for a woman is not an option!&lt;br /&gt;2. Waxing is good but it is a big hassle, messy most of the time, expensive and it pulls the skin...sometimes in some areas (underarms!)this might leave strech marks or loosen the skin with age...both are terrible..&lt;br /&gt;Now last time I looked at epilators it was years and years ago when they looked like Spanish inquisition torture tools...&lt;br /&gt;but I am never completely happy with my methods of epilating so I checked again and got the Braun 7681...it is Braun after all, they know how to get a job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator is The Thing I have been looking for all my life! :) It is perfect in every single way. Do not look at the price, do not worry about anything else, they do have the return policy if there is a manifacturing defect by any chance, but the machine- it is all you will ever need to feel smooth, light and happy with the least amount of effort... finally! Thank you! I will not write what is written on the box already but :&lt;br /&gt;1. The pain issue- on the legs there is practicly no pain ...if you have been waxing you will have no pain issues at all! If you have been shaving...you will have to deal with the consequences for a while, than you will be rewarded with all the great things about pulling your hair all out ...very painlessly!&lt;br /&gt;Armpits- it is not totally painless as with the legs but it is not a big deal and not getting your skin stretched in this area- it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;2. The design is very sleek, it is light and I love the adjustable moving head that follows the curves of your body, I can imagine the different heads and wet and dry use will make it only much more versatile and fun...can not wait to experiment with them...The two speed system workes great- you will figure yourself how to use it and where.&lt;br /&gt;3. Very important- it does pull the hair out and do not break it. This is the main issue with epilators (not pain!). I have looked at all the hair I pulled with it- it had the root with it......Goodbye waxing!!!!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;4. The trimming/shaving head- a great plus for keeping your bikiny area nice and tidy...you can epilate some, you can trim some, you can shave some more once in a while just for fun...keep you imagination active... and see what is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;This little machine will certainly get all the jobs done, with minimum amount of pain, maximum amount of comfort and very pleasing final results! It is a keeper, ladies! And remember - be healthy and happy firsthand, everything else comes second!&lt;br /&gt;Bottem line- you can invest in this thing- they have made a good job with it!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> IT REALLY WORKS!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product. Definitely better than waxing.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to it but think it works as well as I could have hoped for. I highly recommend reading some of the thorough reviews because this helped me choose the right product.</li>
    <li> think it is great... i dontmind  the feeling at all..it  could work better but i dont have to shave anymore...</li>
    <li> My wife really wanted me to get this for her as it looks like the best epilator out there.  She has used a couple of other models so she knows that using an epilator involves a lot of pain.  Compared to the ones she has used in the past, this epilator actually hurts a bit less.  It has a nice LED light and is cordless, so there are also other features that make this one far above the others out there.  The one concern she has is that it may not be pulling all the hairs, and some may only be getting ripped as hair seems to grow back much too quickly if they were all pulled.  Even with that as a potential downside, she reports the fact that this epilator hurts less makes it worth using over others.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife who told me this is the best epilator she ever used. It leaves skin very smooth and minimizes skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She is super happy now. No more visits to parlors which is both time and money saving. Would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> it is working properly</li>
    <li> I just gave birth 5 weeks ago, and my nurse told me I have a very high threshold of pain because I did it all pain med free. So, while on my maternity leave I thought I would try out this product while my baby was sleeping. If I can do a natural birth I can definitely do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...this is a different sort of pain. Ouch did it hurt, my eyes were watering. And, the epilator is so loud when it is on that it woke up my baby so I wasn&#x27;t able to do it for a long period of time, but I didn&#x27;t really want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it may have been that I was trying to use this on too long of hair and that is why it was so painful. I was using this on my upper leg above my knee and I had not shaved there for a while so it was a bit long. And, very painful to use this on! The epilator also left red blotches everywhere it removed a hair follicle and it remained red until the next day so I had tiny red razor burn looking dots all over my leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the long run after using it a couple times, I am not sure I am a epilator type a girl. I don&#x27;t know why I can do a natural birth but I cringe in pain when I use this!</li>
    <li> I hate shaving with a passion. I have never shaved any surface of my body before in my life, only wax. But waxing takes a long time (takes me an hour just to do my legs) and it&#x27;s frustrating having to wax the underarms for I feel like I&#x27;m just wasting wax strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution to my problems? This epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant at first to spend so much money on one appliance, but at the coaxing and encouragement of those that had it, I eventually bought it. And it has been one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research into which brand and model to go for. And eventually I went for this one. Personally, I never use the wet option because I can barely see anything in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t really epilate as well and I never use any of the other &#x27;heads&#x27; except for the main one. But I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain is minimal, unless you&#x27;re doing the bikini area or towards the upper thighs. But still bearable. Get it. Get a Braun&#x27;s epilator. Do it. You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT. A word of advice? Go for a different model, a cheaper one. This one is really costly and I don&#x27;t even use the other stuff it comes with. You won&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> I am totally satisfied with this product. It works as expected. A bit painful at times, but results are worth it.</li>
    <li> It was a nightmare, it pulled my skin in.and I had difficulty in taking my skin back.I was frightened. I have a photo of my injured skin , if there was a photo option, I would have put it here.I gave it back anyway.</li>
    <li> This is really good product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun epil device.  This first one I purchased overseas was a basic Braun Silk-Epil unit (about 10 years ago) without the wet-dry feature, no extra attachments, etc etc.  It was just a basic epilator.  I remember thinking that the first epil device was so painful that I would rather shave every second day than be in total pain for hours while I slowly ripped out my leg hair.  That being said, I decided to use the old device again several months ago.  I was surprised that the pain was not as bad as I remembered - or perhaps I am no longer as sensitive to pain - who knows.  Nevertheless, I started epilating my legs again with my old Silk-Epil about 3 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that I could take this one in the shower, I was sold.  So, I purchased this unit and have been using it in the shower.  This product is great because I only need to use it about once every 3 weeks.  The hair comes back weaker and not nearly as thick - it just really is not so noticeable like an unshaved leg would be.  Epilating the upper legs is painful, but the lower leg is completely easy and not painful at all.  Bikini area - better grab a stick to bite on....it hurts like....  Under arms - same as bikini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product great for the legs, but would not venture to use it on bikini or underarms as the pain is too bad for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in comparison with the simple basic epilator from Braun - I am just not sure this one is really worth the extra money.  I find it difficult to clean out the tweezed hair from the appliance under the shower as the hair is wet and sticks to the pieces of the epilator.  I also do not find myself using any of the extra attachments, so a basic unit would have worked just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I TOTALLY suggest epilating to anyone who does not do it already.  It is far better than shaving and you will be happy with the results.  This is a great item and does the job well.  I think it works better dry than wet - best on warm skin right out of shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased it as present to my wife.  She is happy,  so am i. It works perfect as expected and the price was ok as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have very course hair on my chin, enough that it is noticeable. Waxing was not an option because I never wanted to let the hair grow that long! I would shave daily - very sad for a woman. Even after laser treatment, I was left with a lot of white hair and after a few years and more hormonal changes, more dark hair appeared. The first thing I want to say about the product is that it took a bit of getting used to. It stings. After using for a few minutes and then a few times it does really get easier. My chin has never looked this good and it stays that way now. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the results. My chin is free of hair and that is a wonderful thing. I am going to start trying other areas too.</li>
    <li> I just wanna say one thing- before you will use this epilator read instructions two times, then everything will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;When I used it first time, epilator bit my skin.. because I was using in a wrong way.</li>
    <li> Not as good as waxing but still it is gud!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this product so far &amp; it is very effective  on coarser hair. Fine hair is tricky though requiring more time in between epilatation &amp; multiple passes over those spots. Keep in mind this part does take longer but the results are worth it! Plus it&#x27;s during these time that the light is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year and a three months ago. It worked great, but then it stopped holding a charge. I asked Braun, if the bottom was replaceable and they said it was no longer under warranty and that they did not sell the bottom separate from the rest. Personally, that&#x27;s a lot of money for a product that didn&#x27;t even last two years. I Just bought the  Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator because it has a plug in cord.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product although this product was not what I expected at all. It was extremely painfull and has just been sitting in the box since.</li>
    <li> Ingrown hairs galore, pretty impossible to use on armpits or anywhere other that legs and front bikini line. Legs took forever, had to go over same area many times. I will stick to waxing. Money wasted :(</li>
    <li> I already had an old Braun and decided to get a new one. This one works great love the attachments which my other one didn&#x27;t have</li>
    <li> This product deserves 10 stars. I works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I recently received this epilator to review, by BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always wanted to try an epilator, but was always afraid to. Now that this little miracle tool has come into my life, I may never shave my legs again! Started with my underarms, just to get one of the most sensitive parts over with first (brave, I know!). That was scary at first, but I quickly realized that the anticipation was worst than the actual pain. Although it missed a few strays here and there, they were very easy to spot thanks to the bright beam of light. I went over them and they were quickly eliminated. Then, I decided to do my lower and upper legs. Lower legs were a snap and did not hurt at all. Upper legs were fine too, just a tiny discomforting on the inner upper thighs. Now, the bikini area... That was a whole other ball game. Front was easy, but definitely not painless, as I have very course hair there. After much flinching and toe curling, I was able to get thru most of it. On the sides, it pinched my skin once and left tiny red marks and that was really painful, but also my fault, as I did not stretch the skin enough. I decided to leave well enough alone and not get too close... I&#x27;ll leave the more delicate areas to my trusty old razor, for now. All in all, I will continue to use this epilator mainly because it&#x27;s quick, easy and for the most part tolerable. I can&#x27;t wait to see how long the results last. I&#x27;m a true believer!</li>
    <li> I was using different name-brand of epilators in past few years. This is one of the best I&#x27;ve used so far. However, I have pretty high pain tolerance so I can&#x27;t judge this product in that aspect. I feel absolutely no pain using it but I&#x27;ve read others reviews that epilation can be painful process. I like that this epilator can be cleaned with water unlike others. I like there is the light on epilator helping see better. There only problem I had so far is using it for sensitive zones. And it&#x27;s not a pain it&#x27;s using right attachment for sensitive places (you have to use narrower one for armpits for example). I used to use one attachment for the whole process but I got really hurt cause general attachment juts pilled off my skin because I guess it&#x27;s so wide. Be careful with attachment choices.</li>
    <li> Thanks to braun i got to experience this product. I have never used an epilator before, it was kind of painful. I guess its something you have to get use to. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use it again, i love how silky smooth it leaves your skin but the pain is kind of hard to get around. The best part to me was the body exfoliation brush and the facial cleansing brush. I really like how they made my skin feel.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun Silk-Epil product, and I am very happy with this one.  I was afraid the cordless wouldn&#x27;t have as much power as my old corded model, but it does.  The charge lasts a long time.  I didn&#x27;t experience any hair breakage as some reviewers wrote.  IT works very well on very short hairs.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the on-off button/switch. It&#x27;s a bit of a pain to rotate, please come up with something more user-friendly next model.</li>
    <li> The Braun Silk-épil 7-561(which can be bought anywhere from $100-$140) is a great product! An Extremely easy to use and very convenient product. I love it because instead of having to buy so many batteries you can get up to 40 minutes of operation after just 1 hour of charging! One of my favorite feature by far is that it can be used in the wet and dry! I was sitting in the tub and it was so much more relaxing for me that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the epil getting wet. When shaving the blade is harmless to use and it is so much better than always having to buy razors that only last for a little while. And the best (which i saved for last) is that every time i use the Braun Silk-épil 7-561 it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean, to give me a great look.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this, it was extremely painful and left my hair follicles screaming bloody murder. I was sweating from the exertion of trying to handle the pain and keep quickly plucking along. Mind you, I have had two kids at home, so this isn&#x27;t for people who can&#x27;t handle getting their eyebrows waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind waxing nearly as much as this, I prefer going to the salon but it&#x27;s beyond expensive. I thought this was the lesser of the two evils. However, I only use this on my underarms and continue to wax other more delicate areas. I enjoy the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave my underarms as I hate waiting for hair to grow out long enough to wax. I was amazed how smooth it was afterwards. My hair follicles protest each yank though no matter what kind of forceful removal process I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of this, but using it all over my body is a no go. Overall, this is probably a great purchase for someone who is familiar with epilation. This was a good experiment for me but it doesn&#x27;t get used as much as I would like it to. I might try again as my underarms aren&#x27;t nearly as sensitive now. And yes, exfoliation is definitely a good idea. I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet. I will update after I have used it in other areas without backing down after a few strokes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a chance to use this product a number of times.  I have been &amp;#34;epilating&amp;#34; for over 25 years and had purchased an older Braun in the past.  The older one worked very well and still does, but I was due for a new one.  I have had other brands, but the Braun is the best. This product is perfect and does a great job.  Everyone contemplating buying this item should understand it is NOT a shaver!  I had read some past reviews prior to my purchase, and some people were disappointed from the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; they experienced while using it.  The first time you use an epilator, there will be discomfort.  It took me a week to work through my legs.  Once you get past that and understand the level of your discomfort; subsequent uses are milder, as the hair is softer and there is less of it.  Now it is easy and quick.  I just love the product.  Thanks Braun!</li>
    <li> Hurts like hell, but good to have. For the hairy guy or gal that needs to get smooth as eggs (:</li>
    <li> Postage was very quick; works perfectly for what I need and that battery life is great!</li>
    <li> Very disappointing performance.  An old cheap one from 15 years ago with the cheap coils works better and pinches less. Does not provide good coverage, requiring many many passes. Given the tendency to pinch,  your are guaranteed pain anywhere but the legs. Sits on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife on her birthday and she love it. She had used some time back Silk-epil 3 and she said Silk-epil 7 is awesome the best thing is it work both wet and dry environment. Love it...</li>
    <li> I really like it. It&#x27;s a bit painful, but using it in the shower helps. You&#x27;ll get used to it, though.</li>
    <li> I really like the fact that I can use it in the shower. Epilators are painful, but it gets better with time, and water does help make things better. I like that I can forget about my legs for longer periods of time (compared to shaving)</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I&#x27;m mostly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this on my face, armpits, and legs. I don&#x27;t experience any pain or discomfort, although I don&#x27;t recommend using this in your bikini area... that can be painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to get all of my hairs, so I do have to go back several times and eventually pull out a razor for those stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s minimized the frequency of shaving, is easy to use, and well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old very basic Braun epilator which I had for 15 years &amp; loved. It didn&#x27;t have all the new features that this one does, it was very basic but worked great. It was not rechargeable &amp; that is why I think it lasted so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this one has a rechargeable battery, I don&#x27;t think its going to last that long &amp; if it doesn&#x27;t make it to at least a couple of years, I will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as all the features, the smart light, shaver head &amp; water proof are nice features but I don&#x27;t find it epilates any faster or grabs the short hairs any better than my old one, even though I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments so it is very close to my skin (i&#x27;ve developed a high pain threshold:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning to this review 6 months later:&lt;br /&gt;I find that the battery looses it&#x27;s charge after only half an hour which is not enough for completing the epilation of even one full leg so I guess I was right about the rechergeable battery. I also find that it just doesn&#x27;t work very efficiently. I read so many good reviews before I purchased but I would not recommend this product. There has to be a better one. If anyone has a suggestion, please write back.</li>
    <li> I always have stubble on my legs when using this, so I gave 3 stars because it does remove it everywhere else very smoothly with no stubble.  I assume that my hair-growth patterns on my legs must be different, although that seems strange to me.  With the epilator or shaving, I always have red dots from the irritation of the stubble and also when the hair grows back (on my legs only though).  However, it&#x27;s has been very smooth in the bikini area, armpits, arms, and face (and these areas are the most painful, although bearable after multiple uses and the hair thins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my legs I think I will use something like Silk&#x27;n SensEpil or Remington&#x27;s iLight Pro - I tried the iLight Pro because the cartridges were cheaper but then had to return it because it was saying that my skin was too light after 30 days use (I had to quickly make a decision with Amazon&#x27;s 30 return policy).  I was extremely pleased with the results, though - my legs were smooth, healing and looking &#x27;normal&#x27; (no red dots or bumps) for the first time in my life, so I really want to try that type of product again soon.  The replacement cartidges, however, can get pricey, so I really do like my Braun for everything but my legs (and maybe that painful upper lip!) in order to keep down costs of the replacement cartidges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sad that we can&#x27;t get one affordable product that does everything.</li>
    <li> takes an hour for 2 full hands, 2 half legs and underarms.  Very very easy, less painful when compared to waxing.  I have used several products before this and none of them served the purpose so nicely at home</li>
    <li> This really does work well. I was afraid, like so many other hair removal products it would barely work or not work at all, but it does in fact, remove the hair effectively. I would probably give this 4.5 stars, but that is not an option. Some of my complaints, I do not think can be helped. It does hurt. I expected this though. If plucking hairs with tweezers or waxing hurts, I do not think there is any way for this not to hurt. My first attempt to use it, I almost chickened out. I touched it to a few hairs and was shocked by the sharp pain of it immediately pulling the hairs out. I imagined doing my whole leg would be impossible. I was desperate though. I have terribly thick hair, very sensitive skin and a an unavoidable knack for getting razor burn. So, I took a couple shots of whiskey, put on an episode of star trek and set to work. The first few seconds were not pleasant. I had read that it got better the longer you did it but did not hold much hope for this to be the case. Surprisingly, it did get better. After about a minute, my skin seemed to toughen up a little bit and I got a knack for how to use it. Holding the skin taunt eased the pain a little. It was slow going, and it took several episodes before I had done my entire leg. When I finished though, my skin was smoother than it has been in months. I read that you can shave in between uses to get it closer, but I decided to epilate the hairs as they grew in. My leg has stayed mostly hair free as well as ingrown hair free for several weeks now. I am extremely glad I bought this product. As I said, my main complaint, the pain, could not be helped and is not the fault of the design. The only complaint I have about the actual product is a small one. The &#x27;precision&#x27; tool which has a smaller opening so you can epilate on your face is not very precise at all. It is located in the center of the tool and it is extremely difficult to see where the opening is, in relation to the hair. I gave up after a few tries and will probably not use it on my face again. It took me a few days to work up the courage to do my second leg, but when I did, I used the epilator in the shower instead of dry. Again, it hurt, but it hurt less in the shower. I ran my legs under hot water for several minutes so they were a little numb to the sharpness to begin with, and the hot water opened up the pores in my skin a little more. I have used it in the shower since then. (Also, it could have hurt esp for me as I do have a lot of thick hair and may not be so bad if you have finer hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summery: It hurts but mostly at first and does get better. It is slow and time consuming the first time, but maintenance is much quicker and hurts a lot less. The product is well designed and does what it claims to do. I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for an alternate way to remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips to make it hurt less: Pull the skin taunt. Do not push down on skin, let the epilator just glide over the skin. Hot water helps. Find something to distract yourself like a good movie. And, if you are so inclined some bourbon or wine or whatever your tastes prefer.ill probably not use it on my face again.

    <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit of a shock when you first use it!  It does require some perseverence to get used to.  The results are definitely worth it! I liked it so much I bought one for my daughter!  She is still getting used to it.  My other daughter hates it.  It may not be for everyone.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect anything less from Braun. It&#x27;s a good company with good products. This epilator does hurt more than my other one, but this is because it really takes out hair! I did not use it yet under water, but alone that I am able to clean it with water is unbeatable!!! It&#x27;s very pricy): but that are things which are imports. I will get over it. Waiting how the ingrown hairs vanish or increase. I probably will make a Video review about the problem with the ingrown hair and if this problem will decrease with this epilator.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Silk-Epil 3170 for years and its always done a great job.  The only drawback was that you&#x27;d always find a few stray hairs left on your thigh or calf, no matter how diligent you thought you were.  This new series 7 is great!  The light makes it easy to see the fine hairs and remove them, even on the backside of your legs.  And since its cordless, you don&#x27;t have to stand in the bathroom tethered to the wall.  And, as advertised, it really does get those fine short hairs better than earlier models.  Definitely worth the price - and Amazon&#x27;s price was the lowest I found.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would do what everyone else swears it does - pull hair out from the roots. I epilated my arms and legs, and 5 days later - would you look at that, a forest of hair. I would say it only pulled out 1/3 of my hair and ripped/broke the rest to a shorter length. No matter how many times I went over the same area, it wouldn&#x27;t tweeze those short pieces. My hair wasn&#x27;t that long, less than a centimeter in length. I&#x27;m not sure why it works &amp;#34;so well&amp;#34; for everyone else and not me. My hair is thin and fine on my body, so it probably has something to do with it tearing. However, I hate shaving, waxing doesn&#x27;t work any better, and lasers can&#x27;t see my blonde hair - so what&#x27;s supposed to work for me??</li>
    <li> Happy with a product, changing depillation experience.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine let me try hers first and I have loved it ever since. You get used to or over the pain and it diminishes over time. This is my first experience with an epilator and I have been very happy with the results. I&#x27;ve noticed how the hair has thinned in density and how it&#x27;s lightened in color. I would recommended this to anyone looking for an easy to learn, simple to use machine like this.</li>
    <li> 2nd epilator I&#x27;ve purchased. Haven&#x27;t had ingrown hairs with this brand.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase. Using a facial scrub  as an exfoliant before use makes it less painful. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator, so I don&#x27;t have any experience comparing it to another epilator. I bought it because shaving was causing my legs to have irritation and infection of the hair follicles. I also recently started getting a lot of ingrown hairs on my legs. This epilator works okay on my legs, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to grab everything and I end up having to pluck the remaining hairs with tweezers which is time consuming. I have never tried it on my underarms, because shaving my underarms is still fine for my skin and quick and easy. I do find the epilator especially good for the bikini line; makes a nice clean line without irritation. This was one of the more expensive models, maybe I should have tried a less expensive one to start if the results would have been the same, but I can&#x27;t speak to that. It works fine and I use it every week.</li>
    <li> So far I have only used this on my face.  It does a better job than other epilators that I have used, but it still did not remove all of my facial hair that I had expected it to.  I have used it numerous times over the last two weeks and it has still not removed all my facial hair.  I have used it according to the directions that came with this product.  I am still considering sending it back before my 30 days are up.</li>
    <li> It is not as powerful as I had hoped. Also, if not careful, it can cause a burn, then scab, then scar!</li>
    <li> I bought this product last November and I have only used it twice all this time.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use it for the third time this week and it does not work at all. I cannot return it because of the return policy. It is quite expensive and I expected it to last for some years since I only use it for emergencies when I cannot wax for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy it!</li>
    <li> works great but does not get the tiny hairs as described sometimes breaks the hairs in half instead of pulling them and can&#x27;t get them. for the most part its a great product works a lot better than the one I got from target for 60 bucks</li>
    <li> I used this Epilator literally ONCE before the battery gave out. It charges to the point that the light is solid green, I unplug, start using and it lasts no more than 60 seconds. So frustrating!!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;Item was &#x27;as expected&#x27; and was as described on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;I agree it is a little pricey.  I haven&#x27;t purchased competitors epilators so cannot give a comparison of price versus function&lt;br /&gt;I can say that it was well worth the money to have smooth legs that require little effort/maintenance&lt;br /&gt;I use the epilator function for the lower leg only&lt;br /&gt;Initial use could be described as a bit &#x27;painful&#x27; but not intolerable.&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;ve gone through the &#x27;initiation&#x27;, maintenance is easy and practically painless&lt;br /&gt;I recommend two quick &#x27;touch ups&#x27; per week.&lt;br /&gt;A gentle pumice stone rubbed on the lower leg gives you smooth skin, sloughs off dry skin and pretty much prevents ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I used the pumice stone trick for shaving too.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this item again</li>
    <li> I love it. It is a little painful, but if you do small areas at a time and do your hair removal under running water, it works great and is not too painful. Of course pain is relative, but I am a wimp, and I can handle the pain.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it promises. My legs are smoother than when I wax them. Beware if you have a low pain tolerance; it hurts!</li>
    <li> HATED IT.. supposed to remove hair.. VERY VERY PAINFUL.. wish i could return it.</li>
    <li> 110~220v work it any power???????</li>
    <li> Love that I can now go back to being cordless. I have used Braun epilators for about 20 years now and the first one, which was cordless, lasted 15 years! When I bought the second one, a few years ago, I couldn&#x27;t find a cordless and although that one was still in good working condition, I bought this model just for the convenience of being cordless. It doesn&#x27;t need to be charged often either. I have only used it dry and it is as good as my Braun epilators have always been. I think the shape on this one is more ergonomic or effective, it feels easier. The trimmer also works well.</li>
    <li> I convinced a friend to by an emulator based on the fact that I have had one forever and love it. She got this one.  When I show I fell in loved and just had to have it.  I&#x27;m not at all sorry. Everything I l o bed about my old epiraltor and so much more...better.</li>
    <li> As with any Epilator there will always be some discomfort involved. I mean your plucking the hair out by the root. I must say that this is not as powerful as my cheap cordless one. It does run smoothly and the attachments do come in handy. I have used about 3 of them. This epilator is the first one I tried under my arms mostly due to the fact that it is not so intimidating. It was uncomfortable but after a few times I have found it easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Light&lt;br /&gt;Smooth operation&lt;br /&gt;Attachments&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is as expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cannot operate while plugged in&lt;br /&gt;Not as powerful as a corded unit&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper devices have same number of tweezers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried this in water as I prefer to work with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not experiencing ingrown hairs but that could be due to exfoliating regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Nearly 50 and never tried this.  I may never buy another razor!&lt;br /&gt;Really hurt the first few minutes (as they all do) but nearly two weeks later, most hair has come back softer/lighter and nearly invisible; just beginning to actually see some darker stubble. Normally, I shave every other day - my hair is not thick, but stubble was so dark as to noticeable very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Device was easy to use, charge lasted most of first use, and it quickly recharged.  I took advice and cleansed and moisturized well afterward to minimize irritation.  It seems that this has actually worked quite well to remove hair (not just break it above root), and going slowly, only a few passes were required.  ie, if I used it right, it worked great!</li>
    <li> Really worth buying....I am using an epliator for the firs time but I am totally loving this product The different attachment are really useful. Although it pains during the first use, but it will go away with the later use.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!! I&#x27;ve been waxing for over a decade and was pretty tired of having to wait for my hair to grow out each time. This product is great because it gets hair as soon as it pops up over the skin. I was a little nervous about the pain factor after reading other reviews&#x27; pain ratings; but it isn&#x27;t as bad as many people were saying (maybe because I&#x27;ve been waxing so long). In fact, I use it on the highest speed and don&#x27;t even bother with the guards because it works better without them. Rough skin was a problem the first two times I used it; however, after the third use my skin is much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery life is great! I can do both arms, underarms, bikini, and whole legs and the hot water in my shower runs out before the battery on this epilator. It&#x27;s a great product and I am already recommending it to my friends!</li>
    <li> This is a great brand and a great product. its easy to clean, charge lasts a long time and is wicked fast. Im new at  epilating but I feel tat this product trumps others.  It does hurt a little bit the first time but you get used to it really quickly.</li>
    <li> I wish I bought it earlier. I wish it could grab all the fine hairs. All in all, I think it&#x27;s a good purchase. Totally recommend</li>
    <li> But not very much different from my old epilator except you can wash this one. It skips lots of hair still. Anyway, trimmer turned out to be very useful for my husband, so i&#x27;m glad we bought it.)</li>
    <li> This is my second Epilator and it is much better than the original one I owned. I honestly didn&#x27;t use the first one much beyond my first few tries. It was just too painful for me. I was hoping that this one would be less painful since it had a lot of improvements and it is waterproof. Unfortunately, even in the water I am too much of a wuss to use this on my legs. It hurts and it leads to bright red tiny holes all over my leg where the hair was just yanked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, it works great on my face. I have a few dark (and lots of light) hairs on my chin. The pivoting head is nice and allows the machine to curve along my face and get all of the hairs. I use this on high speed with absolutely no pain to stay smooth. It works great! I did learn one lesson the hard way though; make sure your skin is clean before you use this epilator. I was tired one night and used toner on my face and then I felt a hair and decided to epilate without washing the toner off. My epilator has been oily since then. I have been soaking it in rubbing alcohol and it is finally almost back to normal. Make sure your skin is clean before using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t care for the shaver head because it doesn&#x27;t get a close enough shave for me. I have not tried the trimmer cap because I can only think of one area where that would be beneficial and I am not that brave. I mostly just leave on the efficiency cap and use that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator does have a great battery life. I have used it quite a bit and only had to charge it once. The charge seems to last for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great epilator if you can handle the pain. I am definitely too sensitive to use it all over. I like using it on my face, but I would not have paid the current price for it for just that.</li>
    <li> My wife used to have an old Braun epilator and upgrade to this ultimate epilator. She was really happy with this new adquisition, she realized that the new epilator was more effective and less irritating than the old one.</li>
    <li> good product.  I have used it about 3 times and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet.  No cord makes it so much easier than a corded one.  I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  It isn&#x27;t as load as my older model, cleans easily, and has some nice attachments.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, it offers several settings and interchangeable heads. It is slightly painful the first few uses but within a month I have seen great results which include less hair that grows in finer than before.</li>
    <li> First, the issue of pain ... this is only mildly discomfortable, largely because it doesn&#x27;t actually work. After all, breaking hairs off rather than pulling them doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it in May, hoping to have a razor-free and wax-free summer. Given that hair grows in cycles, I used it every two to three days for several weeks at a time, hoping that it would eventually lead to freedom from the razor. It never happened. It always, ALWAYS left stubble behind. A few weeks ago, I pulled it back out hoping maybe I&#x27;d done something wrong and it would help get ready for spring break. Nope. But, I think I figured out why. It&#x27;s not actually pulling hairs ... it&#x27;s simply breaking them off. OK ... maybe it&#x27;s pulling some of them, but having just spent a whole hour on the fourth session in 10 days, my lower legs still have significant stubble. I&#x27;m not overly furry ... . I certainly feel a few twinges, but nothing to make me wince. I seriously don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s pulling more than 25% of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every which way ... in the shower, in the bath, after the shower (clean, dry skin). Nothing improves the results.</li>
    <li> I always do my research when choosing a semi-expensive product. I spent a few hours reading reviews on Amazon as well as other review sites and for what I wanted (epilating multiple areas), this one sounded perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you are very sensitive to pain then I am giving you fair warning: this HURTS! The first time I tried it I thought I would never use it again...if you have ever gotten a tattoo, this is pretty close but it feels a little worse because you are doing it to yourself. But I do have some good news...it does get better. I waited to write my review until about a month after I started epilating. I just finished the third time and it is so much better than the first! And it is totally worth it. My hair grows so quickly that I used to have to shave every single day so this is great...I would say it lasts about two weeks, but one thing I noticed is that my hair grows at different speeds so I have had to do some touch up here and there. The touch ups don&#x27;t hurt at all, probably because the hair is so random.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as far as other areas are concerned, I haven&#x27;t gotten there yet. I&#x27;m not ready to go through that initial pain again just yet. But I will get there. One tip is to get a post-epilation/waxing lotion or roll-on to apply immediately after you epilate. It makes a world of difference for pain as well as red marks.</li>
    <li> A little about me. 35 years old. Tired of shaving and a few hours later my legs feel stubbly I decided to start epilating. I have tried 2 other high end ($100+) epilators and was really let down. (Never mind the cost putting me off)&lt;br /&gt;This is my most recent purchase.&lt;br /&gt;After reading many many many reviews and comparisons I decided to try this Braun 7.&lt;br /&gt;(My other option was the red emjoi emagine but since it does not have the light to show hairs that the epilator is missing this felt like a better option that and this epilator is also rated safe for in shower use)&lt;br /&gt;I found that this epilator does a much better job at grabbing hairs than the panasonic satin perfect with ceramic disks. It is also superior to the lower numbered Braun options. I have medium to fine hairs and many times the others would not be able to grab the finer hairs or would simply break off the hair instead of pulling it out.&lt;br /&gt;I did try this version in shower and feel that is a bit of a waste truthfully. It is too hard to see and feel if it is getting many hairs other than course hairs that are easily viewable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The additional attachments are nice but not necessary for me. So I won&#x27;t go too much into those... my main need was the epilating to be far better than what it was with a couple other purchases. It would be nice if there were more than the 40 some odd tweezers to help reduce time. (Which is why I considered the Emjoy but due to the light not being on the emjoy and a few reviews that I read saying this was the better choice) I am happy with this purchase (and for all the money I have spent thus far... I better be) haha</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take all the hair ..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than waxing that for sure.. i haven&#x27;t used it long enough and regularly to pin point its faults but so far I like it.</li>
    <li> This product works GREAT!  I will admit!  I did not follow directions first time trying it and I wish I would have.  Would of saved me a lot of pain.  But, once I took the time to read them, and follow them I was very surprised!  Very Very little pain if your hair is literately about the length of a grain of sand!!!!!  It takes a few uses to get all the hair, but once you do, You will be surprised!  It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since my last use, and not much hair has come back yet!  And the hair that is back is finer, softer, and a lot shorter than it would be if I let it grow after 3 weeks of not shaving!!!!!!!!!!!!  After use I did not get skin irritation at all!  I am so glad I found this product!  Can&#x27;t wait till summer to show off these smooth legs!  5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Comparison to an earlier model:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a Braun SE 7181 WD Silk Epil 7 Epilator, Orange/Copper since 2011. It still works well, but it yanks on the hairs in a way that causes unpleasant sensations. I&#x27;ll be truthful - it&#x27;s painful to use. After frequent uses it&#x27;s still working well though. With repeated uses and improved technique, the pain is less severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Braun SE 7681 Silk Epil Wet and Dry Epilator is in my opinion much better than the earlier model. It seems to remove hair faster and cause less discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both models leave the skin feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A frank discussion about an unmentioned hair problem:&lt;br /&gt;The hair on women&#x27;s forearms is seldom mentioned. Talking about overarm hair is a last taboo. Unlike underarm hair, which is okay to discuss, the problem many of us women have with hair on our arms is to be ignored. We can&#x27;t wear long sleeves all the time though. The Silk Epil epilator is for removing hair from \\&quot;legs, body, and face.\\&quot; Continuing to be honest, it works well to remove forearm hair.</li>
    <li> It is a fiery anguish stick that feels like a billion little fire crabs giving you death-embraces, but that means it&#x27;s working well. I recommend using it under running water.  EDIT: This did not work on my face, but did work on my legs. I bought it for my face though, so I sent in a refund. It comes as a CitiBank prepaid visa card, so be warned that it may look like a scam! &amp;#34;Why am I getting this Citibank card? Sounds like a scam!&amp;#34; Nope, it is your refund!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for a few years now, this one is working great for me! I don&#x27;t use this razor for my legs because I have one with two foils that I use strictly for my legs and I have pretty thick hair, but when traveling it&#x27;s the only one I bring because it does the job and more. This is great to trim and shave, but my main reason for purchasing it is the epilator. The epilator works great! I especially love the wipes and attachments it came with. I couldn&#x27;t epilate my chin without breaking out with my old one. I&#x27;m not sure if the attachment or wipes made the difference but I&#x27;m so happy no to have the tweeze my chin anymore. I also use this to epilate my arms. Tips for first time epilators: Take a Advil or something 20-30 minutes before you start. Wash area well before and after well to avoid breaking out, if you still break out try applying tea tree oil to area after you wash with soap or acne cleaner.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I no longer use razors. Yes at first it tends to sting a little but you get use to it right away. Best hair removal product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The epilator is great, it&#x27;s silent in comparison with other brands and it&#x27;s gentle. It does its job and the fact that is wireless really helps. I&#x27;ve had epilators for more than 10 years, and Braun always met my expectations and did exactly what the manufacturer promised.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator! I had a prior model that was dry-only and the ability to use in the shower is a major improvement. The steam helps to ensure I get all the little hairs. I see some complaints about the battery life. I have had this product for over six months with no issues. I only charge every few uses. I use on my legs, underarms, and bikini area. You have to move it slowly across the area - not like you would a shaver, much slower.</li>
    <li> Hurts the same as my old, plug in one. I still needed to shave, as it didn&#x27;t get all of the hair, but I could go longer in-between shaving. I don&#x27;t know if the pain and the time it takes to complete both legs is worth not shaving...</li>
    <li> It only works if it is NOT plugged in and the battery doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to do both legs. I don&#x27;t think I am particularly hairy but the battery allways dies before I finish. Then I plug it in and it still doens&#x27;t work. I have to wait for it is charge again before I can use it. Cordless is great in theory.</li>
    <li> Great! My wife loves it! I bought it for her birthday and she loves this thing. She is saying it&#x27;s the best epilator she has ever used....</li>
    <li> With silk-epil it&#x27;s easy to have smooth skin for over a week and the growing hair is thin and not visible. Much better than shaving!</li>
    <li> Most painful and effective hair removal method I&#x27;ve ever encountered LOL. Note that I&#x27;m comparing this to waxing, threading, plucking, and shaving. The best tip I can give you is make sure to hold the skin taught, and clean/wash it gently afterwords to prevent any ill effects of disturbing the follicles like that. So far it&#x27;s been working great for me (whenever I can convince myself to sit down and tolerate it!).</li>
    <li> Hurt more than expected the first time using but worth it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my underarms laser&#x27;d and am currently doing my Brazilian area. I&#x27;ve been eyeing this epilator for a year now. After watching many youtube videos for years weighing the benefits I have to say it&#x27;s the best $90 I have ever spent!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The videos on youtube make it seem like it&#x27;s so incredibly painful but it wasn&#x27;t at all to me. I say if you&#x27;ve gotten waxed you can take this. I found that the highest speed was too painful for the first time using it but the second time and thereafter I&#x27;ve had it on the highest setting just because there&#x27;s not as much hair. That&#x27;s the only reason why it&#x27;s painful because you have a leg full of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely nothing close to getting laser but I say it&#x27;s probably the closest thing there is to the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I epilate my upper lip, my big toes, my lower legs, my thighs, my knuckles, my stomach...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never wax again! There is no mess like the nasty icky wax and clean up and having to shower afterwards... I just brush the hairs off really well and put it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse but sparse hair on my lower legs, and thin light but somewhat denser patches of hair on my thighs, knuckles, stomach, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery: I&#x27;ve been able to use the epilator on my lower legs &amp; thighs 4-5 times before having to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to get one for my mom, mother- &amp; sister-in-law... and anyone else I can think of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think every woman should have one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re one of those women who wants a super smooth legs to the touch (e.g. for your boyfriend), just run a razor over it or get the 7891 with the venus razor. Although you can&#x27;t beat this model at the current $90 price tag!&lt;br /&gt;I just throw some Veet on my legs for 2 minutes before I hop in the shower when I&#x27;m expecting my boyfriend over and that takes care of the little hairs that&#x27;s starting to grow out (not visible but can be felt by touch when you run your hands up your legs)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again not a big deal :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s getting an epilator this summer as an early Christmas present! That&#x27;s how awesome this thing is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 10 stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;Highly highly highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Just excellent. Works fine under water or dry. Long battery (at least so far as it&#x27;s new!). I like also the option of the trimming accessory. Yet, if any suggestions, i had another brand previously which had different levels of trimming and that was useful actually.&lt;br /&gt;Great anyway.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It is easy to use, and it left my legs smooth and silky! After 3 days I have no stubble. I used it both wet and dry, and each was just as easy. I suggest reading the instructions before hand for best results! I did not find this painful at all. I am so pleased with the results! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for her birthday...she loved it!!! of course, on your first use your skin develop tiny little red bumps something that will disappear maybe within the same day or so (depending on your skin)...However, after 1 month of use one of the heads stopped working properly and now she is stuck having to shave her legs with a much smaller head...I was disappointed, I thought for the amount of money I spent on this item I would have gotten more use out of it and to know how excited she was to receive this...what a bummer!!!</li>
    <li> After many years of trying various hair removal methods, I finally found one I like.  I&#x27;m very surprised and want all my friends and family to try it!&lt;br /&gt;I may just be lucky, but I had NO pain removing hair from my legs or arms, just a tugging sensation.  This could have to do with age and many years of shaving.  Also, the first time I tried it, I took ibuprophen an hour beforehand.  But now I don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards I wondered if the hair on my legs was merely broken off, because I didn&#x27;t even feel the tugging most of the time, and my legs didn&#x27;t feel completely smooth, they were left with little stubby-feeling bumps.&lt;br /&gt;[*UPDATE* 1-19-14: Legs are getting smoother, bumps are going away, they appear to be hairs that were just too short to remove, from shaving.  They are taking a long time to grow back, but I have read that hairs grow in cycles and not all at the same time.  I expect after a few months the legs will be completely smooth.]&lt;br /&gt;[UPDATE 2-27-14: Legs are now smooth, very little stubble can be felt.  It takes awhile for all the hairs to grow out long enough to be grabbed.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also epilated my forearms.  There was no pain and they are smooth, though the skin has been very dry, requiring lots of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I worked up courage and tried an arm pit.  There I had a problem.  Skin was caught in the epilator and I got a nasty blood blister.  I have decided to just continue shaving underarms.  This is more of a problem for older people whose skin may not be as tight there anymore. It&#x27;s impossible to pull the skin tight as your other arm is occupied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the face...&lt;br /&gt;This situation was similar to the cold waxing I&#x27;ve been doing for years, painful with white pimples and irritation after.  The epilator pain is similar to an electric shock.  I&#x27;ve found the best way to deal with this is to first shave the skin with the included trimmer head, making the hair very short (but still able to be grabbed).  Thenhold the skin very taught, with the other hand and various grimaces, holding the tongue underneath to stretch it, etc.  I use the protector cap made for the face, so only a small area is done at a time, on the highest speed, and tap-tap-tap then take a break.  A little while later tap again.  Hold the epilator perpendicular to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It has taken me a couple of weeks to get all the hair off the upper lip, with tolerable pain.  But now it&#x27;s easier up-keep, as they only grow in a few at a time.&lt;br /&gt;[UPDATE ON FACE 2-27-14]:  Irritation pimples don&#x27;t appear as often now, and the massaging head is excellent for the upper lip.  Just be careful to keep the skin tight.  The buzzing provided distracts the skin from the pain and it hurts much less.  In my opinion, this Silk Epil 7 is worth the cost over other models just to have this massaging head.  (But the package with 5 extra caps may not be. They only cover up tweezers to create a smaller area, so if you&#x27;re an experienced user you may save some money and get the version without the extra caps.)&lt;br /&gt;Braun should make a smaller massaging head specifically for the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay wipes that came with the unit caused me to break out, I can&#x27;t use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model, the SE7681 with the extra attachments, was a great choice due to the speeds, the power-speed dial (can&#x27;t accidentally turn on or off), the wet-dry capability and the fact that it&#x27;s cordless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed to see they&#x27;ve now come out with an updated model (SE7921spa) that includes an exfoliator brush...wish it would fit this one.  But reviews on that improvement are not good so far, so it&#x27;s not worth buying the newer model just yet.  I&#x27;ll be using my back brush and exfoliation gloves, instead.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend people try this, you might surprise yourself and be freed from daily shaving, cuts, or sticky wax removal methods.</li>
    <li> The Braun Se7681 Silk-Epil Wet and Dry Epilator works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother has been having trouble with chin hairs since her menopause. I was able to take them off in seconds with this. Since then, we have done it several times with quick success. It charges fast and holds the charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different attachments are :&lt;br /&gt;High Frequency Massage System Cap&lt;br /&gt;Efficiency Pro Cap&lt;br /&gt;Underarm Cap&lt;br /&gt;Precision Cap&lt;br /&gt;Shaver Head with OptiTrim comb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We laughed about the names of some of these: High Frequency Massage System, Efficiency Pro Cap, OptiTrim comb!&lt;br /&gt;Basically there is one cap that is for sensitive areas like your underarms, one that is the shaving head with a trimmer, one cap for using on facial hairs, one that gets rid of hairs quick, that is the Efficiency Pro cap, and one that supposedly massages while working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions aren&#x27;t the easiest to understand and are pretty brief. It isn&#x27;t hard to figure out though and the caps go on and off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator itself is easy to hold, although the dial is a little bit strange to use. Once you get used to it, it is fine. There is a LED light on it to make it easier to see. The dial adjusts speeds and the fast one is quite speedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the epilator shines: It does a great job of getting rid of hairs fast. My mother doesn&#x27;t feel any pain or very little pain and the hairs were pretty well established with roots. The hairs have come back less and less, so I feel the epilator is doing its job of getting the hairs down at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is easy to plug in and start charging instantly. The Oil of Olay wipes were Ok but not something we would buy after they are gone, since lotion works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great epilator and the silver color looks good with the white. It can be used wet or dry and that makes it even better. Thumbs up on this one!</li>
    <li> I confess that I&#x27;ve never used an electric epilator until now.  I&#x27;ve tried the OTC products for waxing, (disaster!), and wet shaved for over 40 years.  The electric shavers never lasted long enough and just didn&#x27;t give me the smooth results I wanted.  I&#x27;ve researched the different epilators and brands but never committed to purchasing one, so I jumped at the chance to own this many-featured, top of the line, Braun model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I plugged it in to charge and read the instructions thoroughly.  As described on the product page, it comes with many heads for epilating the different areas of your body.  The included charger works quickly and the unit has maintained the charge throughout any of the times I&#x27;ve used it (hours).  For storage, all pieces fit neatly into a white drawstring bag.  When charged, I chose the massaging head to begin with on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two speeds on a circular selector on the front of the device.  You press in and rotate to choose 1 or 2, for either gentle or efficient epilation, and it is quite easy to operate.  I have to mention here, that a wonderful feature of this unit is the \\&quot;Smartlight\\&quot;, a localized light on the body of the unit so that you can actually see the area you are working on!  Ingenious!  It REALLY helps!  Ok, that noted, I choose the first speed to begin my adventure.  I&#x27;d shaved my legs a couple days prior so the hair was the correct length for epilating, and I began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised.  It wasn&#x27;t too horrible!  Actually, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I&#x27;d expected, and I do believe the massaging head helps, as I&#x27;ve also tried the regular head.  It&#x27;s also important to remember to epilate at a right angle to the skin, and not to press into it, but only to glide over the skin.  Exfoliating before hand and making sure that the skin is clean and dry are helpful hints, in my mind.  Also, keeping the skin tight is also extremely helpful in areas with fragile and sensitive skin (think, bikini area and armpits especially).  I&#x27;ve not used it wet yet so I can&#x27;t address that but I have used it on moist skin and I feel that dry skin seems the easiest and least painful of the two.  The \\&quot;wet use\\&quot; feature is certainly great as you can just rinse it off to clean it without worrying about damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finishing my legs, I moved on to the \\&quot;nether\\&quot; regions.  Yeowee!!!  Ok, I expected it to be sensitive.  I gritted my teeth and continued.  I managed to do a fair job and was pleased with the smooth results.  The cooling cloths helped calm and sooth the area, though a cool washcloth did about the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through following uses, I&#x27;ve found that there is a narrow window for the ideal hair length and it is directly proportional to the pain experienced when epilating.  Long hair hurts more, but that is not a fault of this device.  I think that it would be true with any similar epilator.  What may be best for waxing, is not best for epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is as far as I&#x27;ve ventured with the unit.  I&#x27;ve not used it on my face or armpits.  Shaving and tweezing are too easy for me in these areas and I&#x27;m not really comfortable yet with my skills to feel certain I wouldn&#x27;t take my entire eyebrow off if I tried it there, even if using the included head for these tasks.  Fortunately for me, I do not need it on my upper lip or elsewhere on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth mentioning, this unit includes an entirely separate shaving head.  So, you can wet or dry shave the areas you don&#x27;t want to epilate, so convenient, and saves extra expense and shelf space!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, I am very happy with this epilator.  It does a good job and, thankfully, it does get easier and less painful with repeated use.  If I were to pick one to purchase, I would be very happy with the performance and cost of the Braun Silk-Epil 7681 Wet and Dry Epilator.</li>
    <li> I am seasoned in epilation as my first epilator was an Emjoi with many more tweezer heads; this Braun has a very light touch in comparison! Hair removal is a bit slower but this little machine is efficient! I specifically purchased it because of it&#x27;s promise to catch all the fine hairs - WHICH IT DOES; I am very pleased! With my previous epilator, I tolerated the fine hairs because they were hardly visible but I never experienced that silkiness that results from shaving; the Braun SE7681 Silk-&#x60;epil 7 DELIVERS. It has multiple attachments which I figured I wouldn&#x27;t need but I&#x27;m finding I really like the options I have - NO MORE PEACH FUZZ on my face either! When it comes to epilators, bigger isn&#x27;t necessarily better; Quick &amp; Sufficient (Emjoi) VS. Slower &amp; Highly Effective (Braun)  The choice is yours!</li>
    <li> Still does the job though and I am pleased in general because it works really great. The only downside like I said is it doesn&#x27;t pick up small hair as easily.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS THING!!!!! I will be gifting my daughter one in a few months : ) I&#x27;m so slick, I almost slide out of bed at night!</li>
    <li> it is a very good product i recommend it . the only thig bad is th shiping it takes long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this epilator after having used emoji for about three years.  First time I tried it was in the shower.  For me, I think my hairs were too weak to be fully pulled out while wet and many of them seemed to snap off instead of be pulled from the root.  For beginners, using it in the shower with the efficiency head is a great option because it does really help with the pain.  Epilation can be very painful when you first begin.  It improves greatly over time as your hairs grow in thinner and lighter and you get used to the process.  That said, I had the smoothest results using it dry without any cap at all.  I use it with all the tweezers fully exposed - this is not recommended for beginners as it will be very painful.  But once you adjust, this method does catch the smallest of hairs.  When I used the standard cap or efficiency cap I didn&#x27;t get the same smooth results.  Although I don&#x27;t use the wet feature while I epilate I do use it to clean and sanitize the epilator head after each use.  This is a very helpful feature that I think also keeps it performing at it&#x27;s best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the battery is now dying after about 8 months of use (I use it every two to three weeks).  The red battery low light will flash within 2 minutes of use and the motor runs slow.  after about ten minutes it will shut off altogether.  I need to see if it&#x27;s under warranty and if I can send in for repairs.  Otherwise I have really found it to be helpful.  It&#x27;s pricey and should last at least two years in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this Epilator, because you can I use it without plug to the electricity you have to charge the product and after use it. The epilator has a light to help you to see better the skin. For my is perfect</li>
    <li> Received my epilator about two weeks ago and have used it five times since. I&#x27;ve epilated my legs, arms, armpits and bikini line and am happy with the results so far. This was my first time epilating ergo the very first use was extremely painful. However, it&#x27;s becoming more bearable with each use. Since i&#x27;m new to this, i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s meant to leave the skin completely smooth, but I do find that it misses short, fine hair. I am having to use it every few days to get a complete smooth epilation but that could be because i&#x27;m a new user. Overall happy with the results though, and so is my husband.    UPDATE: I have been using this epilator twice a week for almost three months. Ingrown hairs everywhere! My bikini line looks terrible. Prior to using this I had one of those as seen on TV trimmers which worked well enough for me to comfortably wear a bikini. Bye bye bikini and hello board shorts. I have ingrown hairs under my arms, on my legs and especially my bikini area, despite exfoliating and moisturizing. I hope my skin recovers after discontinuing use. This product is not cheap, I would not pay that much for a product that causes so many problems. So very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Excellent, I found what I expected thx</li>
    <li> Braun has always been superior to others brands in this kind</li>
    <li> Item works as described but for a product to comes with all these pieces it should come with a bag to store it in</li>
    <li> Was extreme ly dissatisfied with this prouct.this product worked only one time. After that the motor would run and it would do absolutely nothing it cost an awful lot of money has a brand name and is worthless. Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with my Braun Silk-Epil wet and dry epilator.  I had never used and epilator before but I had tried waxing.  I purchased this item because I was going on a vacation and did not want to worry about hair removal while away.  It seemed more finacially responsible than waxing.  These days every penny counts.  To start with it hurts but that is to be expected with pulling your hair out at the roots. For me using it in the shower seemed to be slightly less painfull than using it dry.  The light is a nice, and helps you see the hairs.  It takes me about a half an hour with at least two slow sweeps over each area that I do, my legs, under arms, and bikini area.  I always seem to miss a few hairs somehow and still need to shave, but that time is cut into nothing.  It leaves everything smooth for about 2 1/2 weeks and then I give one week for growth before repeating.  Overall it is a time saver for me.  I thought about trying it in a Brazillian style but I am afraid.  I guess I will still pay for that waxing service.  Well worth the money if you can tolerte 30 minutes of discomfort every three weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different epilators over the years and this is the best one!  It removes very short and very fine hair, no waiting to grow 1/4&amp;#34; + length. Better than a razor, without the razor burn. Love it. I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this epilator.</li>
    <li> Better than any other I have used.</li>
    <li> Loved it!  Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Works great in and out of water. Gets the really short ones too.</li>
    <li> Its working good and i like the way it works.. it shaves the hair neatly.. I fee its a bit more pain  but its  manageable..</li>
    <li> I love the features of being able to use the silk-epil in the shower and that it can be recharged. It is easy to use and didnt bother me at all. I was worried that I wouldnt be able to endure the hair pulling  but its not a problem. Like it and I would recommend it for winter mostly but not so much when you want bare legs.&lt;br /&gt;The reason it gets 3 stars instead of 5 is that some hairs are hard to get so it takes awhile. I  need to use it twice a week and it takes lots longer than a razor. I was hoping I&#x27;d only need to do legs every 3 weeks. It comes with a razor attachment that works pretty good and I need to use if I do want a close shave. Heads are easy to change. I like it enough that I&#x27;ll keep using it but wish shave lasted longer and was closer.&lt;br /&gt;One good thing is that after I did get used to it, I found it easy to use out of water as well.&lt;br /&gt;Have never used attachments other than shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde, thin hair. Not sure if this makes it harder for the silk-epil to grab ?</li>
    <li> After my girlfriend tried this she was not very satisfied as it hurt alot according to her. If anyone knows something better then epilators please let me know</li>
    <li> One word....OUCH. This is a painful product. I really love the concept but can&#x27;t deal with the pain (and I had natural childbirth that wasn&#x27;t so bad). I found that the waterproof factor was helpful because I could use the product in the shower with the hottest water available. It seemed to take a little of the pain out of my mind! It&#x27;s a sturdy, lightweight product but if you can&#x27;t handle pain, don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why we, as women, continue to torture ourselves for beauty! Stop the madness.</li>
    <li> This epilator works really well, so be warned that the first time you use it it hurts like ... heck! I had already been using other epilators for several years, so for me it doesn&#x27;t hurt that much now. Some of the areas that I use it on, like my calves, the hair almost never grows back. I&#x27;ve tried 2 Panasonics and also an older Braun that is not a wet / dry model and I think this one is the best yet. Since it is wet and dry and cordless I sometimes use it in the shower with a little hair conditioner so that it moves smoothly on my skin. The battery life is good and sometimes I don&#x27;t finish all areas that I wanted to epilate, but it does recharge in about an hour.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever purchased. When the coiled spring epilator came out many years ago, my mother purchased one. When I tried it, I swore I&#x27;d never do it again because it was so painful. With that, I was a bit skeptical of buying this one. However, I absolutely love this product now! I use it quite often on my legs and have done away with shaving. I read that some people felt it was painful but I find the pain to be rather minimal. I use the towelettes that came with it and I think that helps with making the experience a bit better. Because it is a wet and dry device I did try it in the shower. I personally won&#x27;t be doing that again because it was rather uncomfortable and no where near as painless as doing it dry. Also, the battery seems to hold a pretty decent charge. I&#x27;m able to do both my legs with no issues at all. I have not used this on any sensitive areas but I did try it on my arms. The only issue I ran in to was that it left red marks or irritation marks if you will. They did go away though after about a day. Either way this is a great product, worth each and every penny, and I love it! I only wish I had found it sooner.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for a month, have used it 2-3 times. Now it stopped working: it charges, runs for 30 seconds and then stops with a red LED, indicating battery is discharged. Can&#x27;t return it, now have to contact their customer support.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent epilator, and actually the second one I have purchased from Braun.  The first one I had was also a 7 series but only came with two attachment heads and I had it for about 2 years.  Unfortunately due to extended use in water it no longer held a charge for more than a couple minutes.  At first I was upset however in the manual it is clearly stated that consistent use in water will affect battery life and charge time, so I decided to buy another Braun because I was impressed with my first epilator in terms of hair removal.  This time I decided to purchase the Rolls Royce of Braun epilators and bought the 7 series that came with multiple attachments that included a shaver head as well.  I must say I am not disappointed and am so happy I bought another Braun!  I honestly have no idea how other reviewers can complain about this little wonder.  Yes it hurts like hell but beauty is pain people!!! I love that it comes with all the different sized attachment heads and the shaver head is awesome for when the epilator head might miss a few fine hairs.  I also like that it comes with a shaver head because epilating can take a little time and if I am in a rush I can snap on the shaver head and be hair free in less time and then epilate later when the hair grows back.  For those of you that it is your first time epilating just follow the directions, limit the use with water, and you&#x27;ll be a silk wonder!  Also this is a steal on amazon at the $100 price point because I bought my first one at Target for $100 and it only had 2 attachments, this little baby has it all for the same price, way to go amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. There is a light on it which helps she said and she doesn&#x27;t get razor bumps anymore or itchy after like she does after using a razor</li>
    <li> Better than expected.  The first use is a bit painful but don&#x27;t give up, you will like the end result.  The daily chore of shaving will be eliminated.</li>
    <li> I prefer the old silk epil.  I don&#x27;t like the heads that much.  The older models were better.  But it&#x27;s not that bad. Will keep it.  Also I don&#x27;t like the fact that I can&#x27;t use it while being recharged.</li>
    <li> i liked it. It is very good in removing the body hair, but it is not useful in removing the very tiny hair like the face&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> To pull underarm hair, it is quite painful so I use the razor instead. But I Iike the various parts this package contains. Overall it is a good buy especially considering it even contains a nice razor.</li>
    <li> Works great does as described. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> It got the hair off, so I suppose it works well, but the pain is intense. I put up with it, and it did lessen each time I used this, so I was willing to endure the pain. However, I was very disappointed to discover that the redness and rashy-looking bumps took a very long time to go away; so long, in fact, that new hair was growing back WAY before the rash cleared up, leaving me not smooth-skinned and hair-free as I had hoped, but rashed-up and hairy instead. I&#x27;ve tried lots of hair removal treatments, and this one was one of the worst. I guess it&#x27;s back to shaving and using electric trimmers for me.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, this does seem to work well. I haven&#x27;t used another epilator, so I don&#x27;t know how it stacks up, but it took nearly all the hair off.</li>
    <li> Great epilator. Works perfect underwater. Have used it a few months now. No issues. Would recommend :)</li>
    <li> My first epilator. Good construction and easy to maintain. In my experience, it takes a full charge per leg to painstakingly remove most (never all) visible hair--big time sink, but I already weathered the pain of pulling my coarse, dense hair at the start and don&#x27;t want to give up yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does grow back finer and lighter (it was dense and blonde to begin with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get best results when using the epilator:&lt;br /&gt;-- on stubble at least 1/4 in long (much longer than most people go between shaves); I don&#x27;t believe a word of the &#x27;grain of sand&#x27; claim&lt;br /&gt;-- dry (wet application leaves a lot of hair); requires freshly cleaned/exfoliated skin to avoid ingrown hair&lt;br /&gt;-- on efficiency pro settings/attachment (if I could go without any attachment at all for more comprehensive contact, I would)</li>
    <li> Judging by the Amazon reviews, this was to be a great product. In fact, my wife was very happy with it for the first year. But the battery quickly lost its abilibity to hold a charge beyond one leg&#x27;s worth of epilating. This of course is unforgivable in itself, but made worse by the stupidity of a design which does not permit the unit to be used while it&#x27;s plugged-in, and no way for the user to replace the battery!!    With only a 1yr warranty, it&#x27;s sadly straight to the dumpster with this Braun now*, and will view all Braun products with skepticism in the future. Too bad, as I have always viewed them as a quality brand.    *Actually, I believe our local recycling program can now take stuff like this.</li>
    <li> I used to have previous models of braun epilators - they were better.&lt;br /&gt;This one works under water, but who needs it? Not me.</li>
    <li> Very long battery charge, various and dedicated heads for various uses. Great quality product! Hardly any pain anywhere! Although I haven&#x27;t tried it on my down low private parts yet. Shave my legs with this and 2 weeks later hardly a few hairs come up for observation renewal.</li>
    <li> I can;t ttravel without this!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t brake the hair from the root. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Is a very good I love it.</li>
    <li> I had previously ordered the cheapest version of the Emjoi through a promotion on another site. I was not sure how I would like the whole epilation experience, so did not want to invest much. Surprisingly, it was not too bad.. I have waxed and had electrolysis and laser hair treatments, so maybe my pain tolerance is a bit higher, but it just felt like a rubber band hitting my skin. The thing I did not like about the Emjoi was that it seemed to break off the hair instead of pull it at the roots, and you had to go ever the same area a bunch, which left my skin raw and irritated. I decided to buy the Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, based on the reviews here and on other sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator ROCKS! It pulls the hair at the root, grabs very tiny hairs, and my skin is not irritated or bumpy the next day like it was with the Emjoi. I have not used any of the attachments, but I have successfully epilated my legs, face, and between my eyebrows. I would HIGHLY recommend this unit!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face, neck, arms legs, anywhere.  The only place it stings a bit is the upper lip, under my nose.  Like it</li>
    <li> thank you wery much for very fast siphing,and i loved the product .braun silk epil 7 wet and dry epilator is best epilator ever  easy to use and hair comes bak after 3-4  weeks</li>
    <li> Very easy to operate and got in excellent condition !!!! Worth buying it!!!The attachment for legs and hands is good!!!!</li>
    <li> This actually gets the hair off my face, legs, underarms. I really like the light, it helps see areas that you might have missed. For my birthday a friend bought the nono for me. The name is really fitting. Just say nono to the nono. It breaks so quickly and having to replace the heads all the time is so expensive. I couldn&#x27;t even use it for the full 6 weeks because it kept needing parts. I would recommend the Braun SE7681 Silk-epil 7 to anyone that would listen. Since I was using an old Silk-epil  the pain is so minimal. Usually just on my face. It just takes time to get used to it. The pain actually eases with use.</li>
    <li> When I first received this item I had no idea what an epilator was - I just thought I was getting an elector shaver that could be used wet or dry and had several different heads that could be changed out depending on what kind of hair removal job you were doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a brief scan through the directions I learned that an epilator actually pulls the hairs out from the roots via dozens of tiny tweezer-like things.  First off, do not do what I did and try the epilator head without using the wipes. It hurts. Not a lot, but enough that I was like, \\&quot;Oh god, why???\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes that are included help a lot. You also want to let the hair get to a certain length before using the epilator. The directions say that too long doesn&#x27;t work and although it can pluck out even the tiniest hairs it works best if it is a little bit long. Also, if you haven&#x27;t used an epilator before, I&#x27;d use it on a relatively tough part of your body that won&#x27;t show at first (I tried my thigh above the knee).  This way you can kind of get a good gauge for whether or not your skin will tolerate the epilator because it can cause a rash to break out.  You wouldn&#x27;t want to start on your underarms or face or anything that is really sensitive or would cause you to go into hiding if you had a bad reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it all works out, Great! You&#x27;ll be hair free for awhile since you&#x27;ve gotten it at the root. If it doesn&#x27;t, you still have a regular shaver that can be used either wet or dry with a variety of function heads. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> And with the 7th. Version said \\&quot;let there light\\&quot; , and as my wife&#x27;s aid when she first turned it on \\&quot;WOW...that is bright.\\&quot;. I got this for her as a gift and she loves it.  She can&#x27;t stop going on about the brightness of the light and how much easier it made using it.  She also said that it is probably as painless as she could ever imagine an epilator could be.  She also like that it came fully charged so she did not have to charge it first.  I strongly recommend this for the ladies and also to hubbies who like them to have soft stubble free legs.  Yes, it makes a great gift because it is such high quality that any wife or girlfriend would love to own one.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this, I had a Panasonic for years that finally died and this is excellent. I love the fact that it can be used in the shower, that really does make it a little less painful. this is very handy, a little loud- but they all are to some degree. small in size, charges easily. I am loving this. and it really does seem less painful than the one I used for years. I could never do under my arms and can with this product. ive only had it for about 5 months but so far, excellent</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my epilator.  I don&#x27;t have to use it very often since the hair growth has slowed down.  Initially it was quite painful but after using it again and again I really don&#x27;t feel the pain.</li>
    <li> To be fair the Braun Epilator does exactly what it claims which is pull out hair. My legs were smooth for about a week and a half and then the hair started to grow back. First it felt like there were ants crawling under my skin so of course I scratched. The irritation from the hair growing back was worse than when I shave. I think at this point I should visit a dermatologist because I have very sensitive skin. I&#x27;m disappointed with the end results but I may just have particularly sensitive.</li>
    <li> It hurts but its worth going a while in between... plus you get used to it and after while it doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all. :) Gets all those stubborn little hairs and I love how easy it is to clean and has a little light to help you catch those sneaky hard to reach hairs.</li>
    <li> Bought it for mi wife and she us very happy with the versatility and capability to use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> My wife said it worked better than a lot of her past product choices. According to her, these things are not painless, but not any epilators are. However, it does get the job done with less snagging and irritation.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. at first used the epilator on one leg and the shaver part on the other leg. major redness and red bumps on the epilated leg for almost 2 days and it did hurt. i tried it with the epilating pads that came with it.  so i decided just to use the shaver part.  well after 2 days i tried it again this time i did it in the bath didn&#x27;t hurt and no red bumps and actually got better results going on 5 days now and you can tell minimal hair is coming back.  i have tried everything from different women&#x27;s and mens shavers, creams, waxes.  this seems like it is going to do the job and i have very sensitive skin.  thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> It looked great and all, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s painful, as expected, but it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference in the shower or not in the shower as it said it would. It left me with ingrown hairs. I wouldn&#x27;t pay 100 dollars for this Item. It was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I just received my Braun Silk-epil 7 in the mail toady. I was so excited to tried as soon as I got as I have been making my research for a long time to find the best epilator for such amount of money. Let me explain how was my experience with this Braun series 7.&lt;br /&gt;what was in the box?&lt;br /&gt;It came with 5 attachments including a shaver head, a trimmer cap, an efficiency cap, a sensitive area cap, and a facial cap. Also, it came with the charger, Olay wipes, small cleaning brush and travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;How was the pain from 1 to 10( 10 is the worst)?&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my legs, my arms and my underarms. The pain on my legs was 5 out of 10. I used it dry and I used the wipes that came with it just 30sec before epilating as the instruction said. the pain was not that bad, it hurts but not that much that make you scream or gets your eyes watery. on my arms the pain was 6 out of 10 why does it hurt more? Because the nature of the hair, the length of the hair and the skin. My hair on my arms was much thinner, a little bit longer so I felt it pinches more. Also, the skin on my arms is more sensitive so I got red dots and little pumps almost allover my arms.&lt;br /&gt;On my underarms, Here I used it dry once and wet the other time. for the dry use, oh my god it is 9 of 10. My biggest mistake was to use it dry on my underarms. I can not tell you how much irritation I had, I could not put my arm down. Even tried to put the first aid pain relief that you use for cuts and burns but I could not stand it, I had to wash it very quickly and put a cloth with cold water on it. it really helped a lot. However when I used it wet for the other underarm, it was almost painless and get the hair very quick. I was done in a minute, irritation free. I think the irritation happened because my skin was dry and going back and forth for such sensitive area was too much.&lt;br /&gt;what was the result comparing to shaving and waxing?&lt;br /&gt;I used to wax for a long time and I was doing it myself, but after I got my son I became really busy so I started to shave. Using this epilator gave me the same smooth skin that I miss from waxing, in a short time which what I was getting from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;what I love about it?&lt;br /&gt;How easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The bright light.&lt;br /&gt;Fully charged in just one hour.&lt;br /&gt;Wet and dry use.&lt;br /&gt;Multiple attachments.&lt;br /&gt;2 speeds.&lt;br /&gt;Giving smooth skin&lt;br /&gt;Getting the hair out from the root, so it will take longer to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;Remember:&lt;br /&gt;Not to use it dry for underarms&lt;br /&gt;Not to use any kind of deodorant or perfumes  on your irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not to charge it near the water, it will not work anyway while it is charging.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with the results and I would recommended for anyone looking for an epilator. I will add more update as soon as I use it on different areas. Update: I just want to mention that the hair took a long time to grow back, defiantly much thiner.ot my son I became really busy so I started to shave.

    <li> I bought this for my wife and she cant praise enough of this product. For starters, she is epilating her underarms for the first time and I have to say that she is very happy with the way this product performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One this she kept mentioning is how useful the LED light is when she epilates. Small light, but big use I guess :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also kept mentioning that the trick is to stretch the skin a bit when its tricky around some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments could be a little over whelming at times... I mean who can remember what attachment to use for what purpose... I help her by quickly referencing the manual (I like to read manuals :)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wifes skin is quite sensitive. like in a scale of 10, 10 being very sensitive, she would be at 8. Also her threshold for pain is slightly high as well, that is , 10 being high threshold for pain, she would be at 8. with this perspective, she does recommend this epilator - in fact - says it wins hands down compared her previous ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product and</li>
    <li> Awesome device. I have been using epilators for a couple decades now, since they first came out. I have also had laser hair removal. So I don&#x27;t have much hair now on my legs and also I am used to a lot of pain. This is so much more comfortable on my legs than my prior device. I hardly felt it on my calves. That said, I did feel it on my upper lip, but it was a bit better than the current one I have used and did not cause as much inflammation in that sensitive skin. I am very happy I upgraded. Having it cordless too, is a great upgrade from my previous one. I use this dry and have not used it wet yet. I am used to using it dry.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell if it is more effective than my old braun epilator, and I did still have to do multiple passes, slow is better, and move the unit in different directions to catch the various directions of hair growth. It would be nice if you could go quickly and not miss any hairs. Maybe mine are finer than most due to epilating and laser treatments.&lt;br /&gt;The light is great, though it can be blinding. I didn&#x27;t think that would be useful, but it highlights all the hairs, even the downy ones that I can&#x27;t see, at the right angle. So it is great to see everything and makes it less likely to miss hairs.&lt;br /&gt;If you have more sensitive skin or are not as used to these you might try icing first (I do on my upper lip) or removing the hair during or just after a warm or hot shower.</li>
    <li> I knew that epilating would be painful but geez. I went to use this product once and am afraid to try again.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t remove meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the Same as I saw in your website, and as I wanted it&lt;br /&gt;but the one thing is it doesn&#x27;t contain any case to hold it in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I have ever used and it&#x27;s excellent! Very efficient, pain is beareable the first time, painless afterwards. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for 3 years, this is the greatest of all, I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Epliating and comparing***&lt;br /&gt;I used Emjoi Elgance before this one , it was bad, the curvy head it has was usless, you can&#x27;t use it on flat areas or some places like under arms, epilating was lame and glides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this Braun epilator, it was amazing, it almost like razor, it remove 95~100% of hair in one swing, unlike Emjoi where you have to go over and over, I did test on half of my leg for both of them.&lt;br /&gt;-Emjoy done the half in about 15min.&lt;br /&gt;-Braun done in almost 3min, and it feels smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun pulled hair more, while Emjoi cuts most of it.&lt;br /&gt;And thanks to it&#x27;s flat head, you can use it everywhere, no need for  extra caps, even without cap once you get used on how it works. I use it on my body, it keeps me hair free for a week, takes me 15min to be done(body legs arms), when Emjoi +45min. It pulls 0.1mm hairs too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Pain***&lt;br /&gt;Pain is not much or unpleasant, I&#x27;m used to epilators, the spike wheels (message system) realy kills the pain instantly. With this 40 fast tweezers pain might be little 5~10% more, but because it&#x27;s efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Charge***&lt;br /&gt;It charge in 45min or less and last about 45min or more, after, it will blink in red for about 10min while in use before stop.&lt;br /&gt;(I used it for about 10min but never stop before I finish with it, so I guess it&#x27;s 10min)&lt;br /&gt;Other brands takes up to 12hrs charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** New to Epilators? ***&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to epilators, first time might be painfull for you, specialy on dark hair, take your time and use it slowly on easy areas like hands, later hair will be soft and easy to pull, and you will be used to epilating feels.&lt;br /&gt;Using it after hot bath reduce the pain.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t quit or look for another, all epilator hurts and this is the best to start of with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 5 stars because of it&#x27;s features, it far great thanany other epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, saving alot of time for me.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anyone. From now on I&#x27;ll be with Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Also charger is 100-240v world wide.&lt;br /&gt;Btw I&#x27;m a man :)</li>
    <li> I love this thing - it has changed my entire routine with not having to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; legs/stubble/etc... only is painful first time or two, then not!</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product. Be prepared to endure some pain the first few times you try it, after that it became very easy to use.</li>
    <li> hurts like a b*%$h though!&lt;br /&gt;really builds your pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;my first use was on my legs. I did my whole legs! the next morning I woke up with large welts kind of freaking out.. three hours later they were gone though.&lt;br /&gt;it is a painful process but does get rid of your hair. you might have to go over certain areas more than once. and exfoliating is a must! ingrown hairs are very common and leave scars if you mess with them. just keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise very good for touchups!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just a punk, but omg this thing hurts!! and the shaver doesn&#x27;t really shave very well. I wasn&#x27;t impressed, especially because it cost so much...</li>
    <li> Works great, but takes getting used to.</li>
    <li> Love it, the best epilator ever and comes with a lot of attachments!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews for this product and others before I bought it. It is very well made and arrived exactly as described. I didn&#x27;t feel like it worked very well for me. I don&#x27;t really have a lot of body hair so perhaps that was one reason. Also, it hurt more than I wanted it to and didn&#x27;t seem to improve with a few uses. Overall, the product is probably great and it was just me that was a wimp.</li>
    <li> I bought this before the summer. Stopped working this weekend (11/2014).</li>
    <li> Works perfect thank you</li>
    <li> Note: This is my first time using an epilator, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands. I have also only used it on wet skin on my legs and armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the epilator for the first time hurt a lot more than I expected. I knew that having a bunch of hairs quickly plucked out of your skin wasn&#x27;t going to be fun, but I was really shocked by how sharp the pain was. After the first time I used it, my legs were kind of red and scratchy and my armpits were sore! However, after my third use, the pain became MUCH more bearable. I am also really pleased with the results in comparison to shaving, especially on the armpits. I&#x27;m not left with gross armpit stubble, and the new hairs grow out much thinner, which makes epilating the next time less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t do a very clean job. Again, I&#x27;m not sure if other brands might be better with this since this is my first epilator, but I find that even after going over the same patch of skin multiple times, the epilator still doesn&#x27;t catch a couple of hairs. I usually use a razor right afterward to ensure I don&#x27;t have any stragglers. I&#x27;ve also found that the epilator sometimes just breaks the hair instead of pulling it from the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator is also great because it comes it a variety of heads (some have massaging grooves, others limit the surface area of the epilator for more sensitive areas, and there is even one with a razor head!). I usually use the massaging head, but there are some that look great for the upper lip and bikini line.</li>
    <li> I had an older version of the Braun Epilator which I would use off and on.  Sometimes just takes too long and too much pain.  I decided to give it a try again this year but unfortunately my dog mistook it for his dinner.  I ordered this version and I can say it is definitely less painful than the older one.  I still get red bumps right away but they go away after a day and I put aloe on right away.  I&#x27;m looking forward to using it on a regular basis so I hope to get the most benefit.  Definitely do not do it on long hairs.  That hurts the most.</li>
    <li> Compared with my old one, it removes hair almost pain free and very quick. Each leg takes only 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I love love love it!!! Easy to use, great result!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!!!&lt;br /&gt;100% satisfaction!&lt;br /&gt;😊&lt;br /&gt;🚿</li>
    <li> it works well, but i wished it works while plugged in to charge</li>
    <li> Good work and good quality</li>
    <li> Finally, i found what i need.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and painless. I didn&#x27;t try all the head yet but just one.  I felt satisfied. It worth the money.</li>
    <li> You are probably scanning through all of these reviews trying to determine if this is a good product and/or whether you can handle the pain. I had the same reservations when I purchased this product. It had great reviews but I was afraid that it would hurt too much for continued use (I am new to epilating). I took the plunge anyways and I LOVE this product! I loved it so much I wrote a very comprehensive review of the product with pictures here:  http://www.ladylikestyle.com/2015/06/why-you-must-buy-this-epilatorshaver-for-summer/  It is a no brainer for a new reasons 1. The epilator does not hurt nearly as much as I had anticipated - no worse than waxing 2. It creates no mess and I finished a calf in 15 minutes - no more hair for 6 weeks!! 3. It is environmentally friendly since you don&#x27;t need to waste shower water or throw out razor blades 4. It is also much cheaper in the long run since you will no longer need to buy expensive razor blades or waxing supplies  And the best reason????  5. Even if you hate the epilator component and never use it again - you can easily use the shaver head that will shave any unwanted hair (long or short) with no pain - same results as a razor and less mess!  You can check out the link above for more information on this epilator. Overall, it is an amazing investment and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This is awesome... no more shaving and the hairs that grow back are weaker.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  Had some pre-thoughts about how good it could be.  She previously removed minor facial hair every other day.  With this unit to our surprise she now only needs to use it every couple of weeks.  Did not expect the great results.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. The only thing to make it better would be to add more tweezers to the epil head.</li>
    <li> I used a Philips epilator for over 10 years, yes the same one and still works, but I thought the technology should got better after 10 years, so I decided to shop for a new one. I started looking for a Philips, but then I found this one and decided to give a try. Is very faast, a lot less painful than my ancient Philips, I was able to use it on my armpits that was something I couldn&#x27;t manage to do with my Philips, I&#x27;m not saying is not painful it is very painful on your armpits at least for me, but I was able to tolerate it. Since I was able to tolerate it in such a sensitive area then I proceeded to use it on bikini areas where it was super painful with my old epilator, and I was able to do a way better job than before, so I used it for legs, armpits and bikini area and it was still running, so battery life doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very good, it doesn&#x27;t pinch your skin at all, I used it without the comb and I was a little scared at the beginning, but soon I noticed it was perfectly safe.&lt;br /&gt;About the caps I only ended up using the main, I tried to use the smaller cap for the armpits cause thought it would be more gentle, but it was the opposite, the main cap massages and that helps mask the pain and it has thingies that helps pic up the hairs, so I found the other caps useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I think that&#x27;s enough review for a one time use, I will update after a few more uses</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but i think it will be more than I found it</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like to shave everyday &amp; dont mind a little pain for beauty&#x27;s sake.....this is a great tool.</li>
    <li> Great seller, great product!</li>
    <li> It ripped the hair instead of actually taking it out of the root, even with holding the skin taught, exfoliating before hand and going against the grain.</li>
    <li> I have had Braun silk-epil different versions before and I loved them. My last one lasted for five years. But this one was a disaster. The shaver head was loose from the very first day. It had a spring that jumped out every time I tried to clean it. Now, after just 9 months, it has completely stopped working. I mean it does make a sound and the head moves but it doesn&#x27;t shave at all. By the way, I do not use it every day, it just once or twice in a month usage when I am in a hurry. I will try to contact customer service.</li>
    <li> Love it ...  I would give it five stars if it would work plugged&lt;br /&gt;It only works when u unplug it :( so sometimes I need to stop working , charge it and then work with it again but everything. Else is amazing .. Buy it it&#x27;s a great deal</li>
    <li> love love love it!&lt;br /&gt;had used one in the past and thought it would be first and last epilator as I had a very painful experience&lt;br /&gt;a friend recommended this and I should tell to all the first time users or gals out there who had tried and gave up this will beat your&lt;br /&gt;expectations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy use, perfect attachments for specific area use&lt;br /&gt;I tried it as a wet epilator (legs) and dry (arms), works as a charm thanks to the massage head no pain at all, may be a slight pinch but nothing&lt;br /&gt;compared to the waxing experience which makes us all scream and think why are we going through all this pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tried the cap for underarms and its too good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worth the money as I will never go back to waxing and razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;charge was long enough for me to epilate my legs, arms and underarms&lt;br /&gt;go give it a try&lt;br /&gt;it truly is the best seller in today&#x27;s market</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews I was psyched up for torture and pain... but &amp;#34;if it don&#x27;t hurt, you ain&#x27;t pretty&amp;#34; someone once told me- I was complaining about sore feet in heels. Using this for over a month, I really like it... and do not think it hurts as much as I was led to believe by other reviewers. My body hair is greatly diminished... saving me time compared to shaving almost everyday. I do a little maintenance shaving between weekly use to get missed hairs and fuzz - but this is minimal. I also exfoliate and moisturize deeply after use as recommended. I really like the design and bright little light beaming on the work area. The battery is good too, I can do all areas of my body I use it on in one charge. The 1st couple times there was more hair and I was more timid so I did it over 2 charges.  I use it on my entire leg, arms, armpits and abdomen with great success. I also have used it to remove random light fuzz on buttocks, small of my low back etc... without need for regular use there. I have used it on my bikini area.. but got bumps...that with an increased sensitivity using this device in and around my private parts... I am shaving &#x27;down there&#x27; again for now.  But the bulk of my body&#x27;s acreage is nicely maintained by this device.  I am caucasian, blue eyed, blonde with northern european genetics and fine hair... meaning the diameter of my body hair is 1000th of an inch in diameter... compared with most people having 2-3 times thicker hair shafts.... so this device does it&#x27;s job on my style of body hair.</li>
    <li> It works just fine, but only works for 30-40 min after full charge, not very practical</li>
    <li> Fantastic once you get over the initial trauma</li>
    <li> Epilator is  Very good for body but I not recommend it to use on your face like advertised</li>
    <li> The epilator works exactly as it was described to work.  I have tried multiple methods for hair removal (shaving, creams, waxing, laser) and this one is definitely the most efficient for the cost.  It does sting a little on areas that I have never had waxed or lasered, but even by the second time I used it, the pain had already lessened.  The hair grows back minimally and stays away longer than if it were to have been waxed off.  It is perfect for people with excessive body hair but not enough time to constantly take care of it.  After one thorough use of the epilator, I have only had to do &amp;#34;touch-ups&amp;#34; occasionally instead of daily attention.  I would (and have already been!) definitely recommend this product to anyone who is trying to get rid of unwanted hair.  If you can handle a little pain to get there, the results are certainly worth it.  :)</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. It was the first epilator I had ever bought, and I had been hoping for something that would provide some long-lasting results. Sadly this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is very useful but I still found that after 30mins of using this I had somehow missed many hairs that would then show up the next day. This means another round of epilation. The red bumps that show up also mean that my legs aren&#x27;t ready to go &#x27;on show&#x27; for at least a day or 2 after using this, but by then more hairs are starting to grow in! The effects definitely didn&#x27;t last as long as I had expected, and for the extra time (not to mention pain) involved I personally don&#x27;t think this item is worth it over shaving. While ingrown hairs could be greatly reduced by exfoliating, that didn&#x27;t entirely solve the problem either, leaving further unsightly marks on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it every now and then, such as several before going on vacation when I&#x27;d like to reduce the burden of shaving slightly, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t think this will ever replace having to shave.</li>
    <li> I have used the product and it doesn&#x27;t work properly. Its very bad in removing short hair. I would prefer no to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And its really painful. I can hardly use it</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this.  I thought it might hurt too much.  It does hurt a bit but only like waxing.  Hair grows back inconsistant so constant upkeep is necessary.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you smooth like shaving but the hair does grow back lighter.  Need to exfoliate though to keep away the ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> Product suddenly stopped working after 6 months! I was expecting a high-quality long lasting product here. We are not heavy users.</li>
    <li> Love this! I got it for fine facial hair because I was so tired of using nair and having it iritate my skin. Now its quick and easy and gets even the finest hair without irritation.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator, and I think it&#x27;s great! Mind you it definitely hurts the first time, but overall I love it. Not having to shave every day is such a time saver! And the light is genius! I cans we every hair so I don&#x27;t miss anything.</li>
    <li> works perfectly. very satisfied</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet.  looking forward to the rinse out option.  will update when I do.&lt;br /&gt;but the portability cannot be beat.  I upgraded to this one for the two above reasons.  I even used it while in the car.  sometimes ya gotta do what ya gotta do.&lt;br /&gt;for those who&#x27;ve not epilated, (it stings at first) make sure you use the trimmer for good hair length first (else you&#x27;ll just break the hair off at the root) .  the first few weeks (whether this is your first epilation or you&#x27;ve waited too many weeks in between &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34;, you&#x27;ll have to use it often due to hair growth cycle.  your skin (unless super super sensitive) will adjust to the sting.  after a while of normal use, it is very easy to bear. discomfort is like scratching a bug bite.&lt;br /&gt;just remember, this is much more time consuming than shaving.  others are much faster than I am.  it takes me a good hour if I wait too long in between because I try to be thorough.  it would be faster and easier to shave.  I prefer this because I have dark hair and pale/sensitive skin.  my hair grows quickly.  I cannot shave everyday due to sensitive skin; every other day gives me a &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34;. this method does not last weeks for me.  again my hair growth is fast.  it does however, give me a solid 3 days before I have to consider &amp;#34;maintenance epilating&amp;#34;.  that alone, makes this uber-worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I, personally, do not epilate under arms. ack. too sensitive. that HURTS. bikini line okay. can&#x27;t go full monty with it though.  electric razor better.</li>
    <li> I got the product in time.  No issue with the product. Worth the price.i will recommend this to other people</li>
    <li> This is my first attempt  with an epilator and I am very pleased so far! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turning it on was daunting, to say the least. The thing lights up and whirrs like something from a sci fi movie. It took me like 15 minutes to summon the courage to put it against my skin.  It was very painful the first time. I&#x27;m not sure what difference the wipes make but they smell nice. I have never waxed, so the pain was a bit of a shock, but now that the initial growth is gone it&#x27;s much easier going.  I&#x27;ve only had the courage to do this on my lower legs so far and they are lovely and smooth. I&#x27;m always careful to exfoliate before and after to prevent ingrowns and it seems to have worked so far. Going to try upper legs soon :D So far I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would recommend it. However, I would save 20 bucks and buy the one without all of the heads and attachments next time, I highly doubt I will ever graduate to using this on my face or more \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! I need to get a new epilator since my old one was not doing its work well anymore. I did not really want to pay this much because my old one that I got for $45 works just fine. I read all the reviews for Panasonic, Emjoi etc at that price range. I finally decided to pay a bit more and go with Braun, because my old one was Braun, and it lasted for so many years before I have to replace it, so I trust the quality. Also, it seems that Panasonic and Emjoi all have problem of not being powerful and slow from the reviews I read. If the epilator is not fast enough, it&#x27;s not just the matter that it&#x27;s harder to remove the hair, it&#x27;s the matter of you are going to get hurt more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I got this one. It&#x27;s better than my old Braun. It&#x27;s fast, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! The massage system really does its job. Please keep in mind that I have been using epilator for quite few years, so I am somewhat used to it. Also I like how light it is, I thought it&#x27;s going to be heavier than my old one since the size is bigger, but it&#x27;s just perfect. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, so don&#x27;t know how well it works in wet condition, but I am very happy with how it works in dry condition.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an epilator, and I would say it has been performing up to my expectations. I was reading the reviews about how painful this is going to be, but so far it has been bearable. I used to wax my legs in the past, maybe that is why the pain was bearable. Advisable to epilator right after a hot shower when the pores are still open! I tried once straight after shower and once randomly in the middle of the day, and I would say that there really is a difference in the pain level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried epilating my underarms. I used a tweezer and plucked it the first time round, and then waited for the hairs to grow out again then I used the epilator. I have read about people who used the epilator on their underarms straight the first time and had their skin stuck in the epilator or some had bleeding after they epilated. I was really glad that I didnt have any of those problems. Actually epilating the underarms felt less painful than epilating my legs. I guess the act of tweezing manually the first time round makes the skin more used to tweezing and it plucks out the roots so the new hairs that grew out had a &#x27;weaker&#x27; root? Which explains why I didnt have much problems epilating my underarms. So it is advisable to pluck it manually the first time round then start depilating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to it is that although we are able to remove the parts to wash it separately, but i still find it hard to wash off all the hairs which are stuck on the tweezers, and the roller parts at the side, even with the help of the small brush supplied. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, it is a great buy! :D</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC!!  I bought a less expensive epilator/shaver through Amazon.  It broke with first use.  (Amazon graciously accepted return.)  I decided to shell out considerably more money to purchase the Braun SE7681 -- I don&#x27;t begrudge one cent!!!  Sensitivity varies from one person to another.  So, since I was unsure about how the epilation would feel, I wanted a product that had a shave attachment as a back-up.  I haven&#x27;t used the shave attachment yet.  The pulling of the hairs is a bit painful but you don&#x27;t mind when you see the results!  Most hairs are pulled out by the root so each time you epilate, there&#x27;s less hair to remove.  I love that I can remove hair outside of the shower.  AND, the light feature is a handy thing to help see exactly which hairs refuse to budge.  Wow!!</li>
    <li> This is just the best epilator, especially for the delicate parts. The fact that it is wet and dry is a great advancement on the old styles. I think because it is a Braun product you know when you get it, it won&#x27;t destroy your skin. Braun is just synonymous with quality so you can trust this.</li>
    <li> I bought my Remington epilator maybe 5 years ago.  I used it every summer and I found it did the job, but it hurt, so I would use it shortly after showering.  This year, it wasn&#x27;t working so well. It was time for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Target I saw this Braun Silk-epil 7 for $109.99.  While I was in the store I checked Amazons price. Same exact model was $78.99.  I ordered it right then and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it!  So different from the last one I used.  In fact, it made my Remington comparable to the original epilator I bought while in college 25 years ago.  Both of those hurt.  This one feels like silk!  Honestly, it does!  It left my legs feeling like I used a quality razor.  So smooth. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but I am very happy with this purchase.  I wish I definitely would recommend this epilator.</li>
    <li> It works. What else can I say about something that &amp;#34;pulls out&amp;#34; hair? I did find the vibrating head something that made the initial sessions a bit less painful. Being cordless is a &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; for me.</li>
    <li> Once you tough the first use on your legs then it is easy peasy from there. Hardly ever shave my legs. Arm pits take some serious teeth gritting but if you keep it up a few times a week to start then it doesnt hurt much any more. I am pretty sure my lady parts flipped me the bird when my bikini line crossed my mind so I decided trying that area is not an option.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and finds it so easy to use.</li>
    <li> epilator left marks on skin, did not remove much hair after multiple attempts on different parts of body. I do like the shaver w/ attachment.</li>
    <li> It pulls tiny little hairs out, although it hurts some, the hair does come back finer and finer.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I rather use it dry (it pulls more hair out), but when wet it is so great because I hardly feel any pain, specially on my armpit area.</li>
    <li> This machine will save me money in the long run. No need for waxing anymore.</li>
    <li> Very small coverage area. Didnt liked the product.</li>
    <li> I had a braun epil silk epilator for about 4 years and it started not working as well. I purchased this as a replacement. I like it a lot.Its nice not have a cord, now I can just charge it and take it with me on a trip. It holds it&#x27;s charge for about 3 full leg epilatings.I tried to use the underarm attachment but found it too painful. I wish I had just bought the one that didn;t have the extra accessories - it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying...it hurts. It pulls hair out from the root so ...it should hurt. With that said, it only hurts for a short period of time, less than a min, then my brain starts to get used to the pain and I am fine. I found it helps to take a washcloth or something and &#x27;rough up the skin&#x27; before starting which basically desensitizes the skin. I found it really helps a lot, then after the first pass or two I don&#x27;t even notice any pain. The wipes do work a bit, also ice packs will help numb it up. Afterwards I use some cortisone anti-itch which really helps with the red bumps. I get red bumps for about 4 hrs after epilating if I don&#x27;t use cortisone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It pulls out even the smallest hairs. Even hairs that are 1/16 above the surface get plucked. Hair does grow back much finer and after a few months I get &#x27;patchy&#x27; hair re-growth. It works well in the shower/bath (waterproof) but I prefer to use it dry. It pulls out even very small fine hairs. I used it on my upper lip a few times and it does just fine. It comes with a separate head for that, which is basically just a cover over the normal head, but it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After epilating the first few times my legs were not smooth, they were a little rough for some reason. I am not sure why but it happened again recently. I used the epilator for many months, then shaved for 3 weeks, then went back to the epilator and when I went back it took about a week or two epilator times before my legs were smooth. Odd, but be sure to give it at least 3 times of using it before you get discouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a head for a traditional electric razor and it has a guard so it can be used as a trimmer, so if a man wanted to trim a beard or something; the guard would work for that, but it could also be used as a regular electric razor if a man or woman wanted to shave.</li>
    <li> She has informed me it is a little uncomfortable when using it. However it does the job. I enjoy the smoothness in her private area.</li>
    <li> It was what I was looking for.. I love it easy to hold, like the extra caps. I use it for my face too!!</li>
    <li> I reviewed several of these epilators before making this purchase.  I relied heavily on reviews.  This product is top notch!</li>
    <li> PRO - includes shaver, multiple speeds, illuminates skin, carrying case, can use wet&lt;br /&gt;CON - epilation still hurts at first, shaver not as smooth as straight razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice combination shaver &amp; epilator.  Good features are that you can use it in the shower, and it has a light so you can see the skin area better.  It is lightweight and has a carrying pouch, good for travel, and is rechargable.  It has multiple speeds, and includes a head cover that lets you focus on small areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does not shave a close as a straight razor, but it is pretty good.  I haven&#x27;t compared it to other brands of shavers or epilators, so I cannot comment on how it compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are curious about how you might like epilating your legs but are worried you may not like it, this is a good model to get because you can always just use the shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one way of getting started with epilation is to epilate a bit, then shave the rest, each time you use it.  Over time, more and more areas will become epilated and so you will be having less and less hair to remove each time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not writing this review because of the amount of pain I was in when I used it. Anyone ordering this should know that a device that rips all of your hairs out at once is going to hurt like hell. Duh. I used this on dry skin first just to test it and it didn&#x27;t take any hair out. I figured I&#x27;d try it in water when my hair is wet and skin relaxed, and it didn&#x27;t take any hair out. It still hurt like a you know what, and I went over the same spots over and over again. Still, it took no hair out, my legs are still hairy. I wasn&#x27;t even intending this for my legs, (was intending it for my bikini line) but the noise it makes is extremely intimidating and I knew I needed to test it on a less sensitive area first. I&#x27;ve dubbed it &amp;#34;The Ripper&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s like a serial killer. I would&#x27;nt even let it near my bikini line! MUNCH MUNCH! Needless to say, I would not recommend this product to anyone, just get waxed. I&#x27;d rather spend the money on what I know will work.</li>
    <li> I previously used an epilator I bought from the drug store and had a lot of problems with my legs after using it. I was constantly getting badly ingrown hairs, my skin became extremely dry, red splotches appeared on my skin that wouldn&#x27;t fade for weeks, and I started to get small scars. I thought I just didn&#x27;t react well to epilating so I gave up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give epilating another try many months later and wanted to give this Braun epilator a shot. What a huge difference! My skin recovers within about a day now - no more redness for ages. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and I haven&#x27;t had any ingrown hairs and therefore no more scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain is the same as my old epliator, and don&#x27;t kid yourself - ripping out hair is ALWAYS going to hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator also came with some pre-epilator wipes. To me it&#x27;s not exactly clear what they&#x27;re for. I gave them a try and didn&#x27;t notice any difference during or after epilator compared to not using them.</li>
    <li> Thanks for your perfection</li>
    <li> removes most hair on legs but not very well on underarm.  i would usually have to run the epilator on the same area a few times for it to grab 90% of it.  i use it dry and not in the shower.  i heard dry gives you better results than wet.  it&#x27;s very loud, too. i bought it because it received high recommendations.</li>
    <li> Have enjoyed very much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the job stated it would preform.</li>
    <li> Decided to grab this after a horrible experience with an Emoji.  I wish I had just bought this in the first place.  Legs are super smooth, and the sensitive area cap is perfect for bikini line.  The massaging rollers really do help soothe the skin.</li>
    <li> I have an old one that&#x27;s about almost 20 years old.  The head was lose so I got this one.  I use this one with out the cover and I only use it in the water when I do my underarms.  It doesn&#x27;t work to well in the water with your legs.</li>
    <li> I think the best part of this razor was the description.  Once I received it, it wasn&#x27;t anything I thought it would be.  I used it first to shave my arm pits.  It made them dark pink and it felt like it burned my skin.  I said, \\&quot;this won&#x27;t do.\\&quot;  I had a time trying to figure out how to return it.  It&#x27;s all done online.  No phone number.  I did return it.  It remains to be seen if I get a refund.  It made me leery of ordering electronics from Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s and excelent product specially for legs depilation... It&#x27;s not painful at all and is really fast, it hurts much less that waxing ... using it on the armpit and the upper lip does hurts compared to the wax, but is faster and it&#x27;s not such a mess.....</li>
    <li> I purchased it here instead of target because they had the model that only does legs for the same price as here, so this was definetly a deal since this epilator has multiple uses. i love it, it does hurt a little,  if you&#x27;re not used to waxing or plucking i could imagine hurting a lot more but it&#x27;s just the initial pass that hurts, you get used to it after a couple passes. When i do my legs its takes about 2+wks till i have to do it again, my underarms is every 4-5 days, i did notice that for my underarms it would break some of the hairs i think it&#x27;s mostly because of the angle, i used to sit there for maybe 2 hours plucking my under arms. PRO of plucking is there&#x27;s almost no breakage and it took about a week and half for regrowth, CON it hurts more and it&#x27;s really uncomfortable, so even though i had longer results with plucking i love the epilator way better hands down! it literally takes less than 5 minutes and you really do have less regrowth. I also did my belly area also 2wks, because its a little more sensitive it hurt alittle more than other areas and i did get red bumps but they go away in about a day. *TIP* if you have sensitive skin and you need to be hairless for a special event do it like 2-3 days before so you&#x27;re not all bumpy and it also helps to EXFOLIATE everyday and use a toner!! it prevents ingrown hairs, i recommend to do the epilator after a warm or hot shower. You have the option of doing it wet but i really recommend to do it dry grabs more hairs. I have not used the wipes so i don&#x27;t know if they help or not and i also love the shaver head too it works great.</li>
    <li> Very nice working. no pain at all. I like everything about it. Light. 2 speeds. Waterproof. And so many different heads. And I like how it looks like by the way</li>
    <li> A lot of money for a product that promises a lot but delivers little. Hair is not properly removed- I get big red bumps on my skins each time I use the device. Poor choice.</li>
    <li> I love my epilator! It is made in Germany so the quality  is excelent! Works the way I expected! I recommended to any woman!</li>
    <li> I only recently found about about epilation and after an extensive online search decided to give the Silk-epil 7 a try, given its many, MANY positive ratings. I really wanted to love this epilator, but a series of events has left me utterly dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I opened the box only to find out the Efficiency Cap had not included, I had been given two Underarm Caps instead. When I phoned Braun Customer Service, requesting that they send me the cap I was missing, I was given the run-around for 30 minutes, them insisting it wasn&#x27;t included in my model, which it IS included in 7681. Instead of apologizing for their error, I was spoken to like a child and told that I could PURCHASE the cap but that they themselves did not sell the replacement parts. Worst. Customer. Service. Ever. If you expect them to do anything, don&#x27;t waste your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the device itself. I really do like the look of it, but it does not perform as well as everyone says. At least not for me. I have used it every two to three days for a week and a half now and I STILL have hairs left, and stubble. I know my hair grows quickly, I was at the point of having to shave EVERY DAY, which is why I decided to try epilating, but if the hair is actually pulled from the root as it claims, it should take more than 2 days to grow back and give stubble. Every time I epilate there are still long hairs it doesn&#x27;t pull, regardless of how many times or in how many directions I go over the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the pain, it really is bearable. The first time I tried it I almost cried, and I literally could only handle a VERY small area at a time. But by the third, fourth, fifth tries, I hardly felt anything anymore (a sign it isn&#x27;t pulling hairs maybe?) and I can do both lower legs without wincing. My legs don&#x27;t get red afterwards anymore either. I haven&#x27;t tried much on my upper legs yet as I&#x27;m trying to see if the thing actually works, which as I have said, I&#x27;m not impressed. My legs aren&#x27;tsmooth like with shaving. It constantly feels like I have stubble. Ugh... frustrating. I&#x27;ll keep going for a few more weeks though, before I toss it and try another make. And thanks to Braun Customer Service I shall NEVER be buying from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have said, unless you plan on using it for your underarms and face, this model really isn&#x27;t work the extra money. Maybe if I had purchased the 7181 model it would have actually come with the caps it should have.</li>
    <li> Mixed emotions here.  Seems to be a good epilator.  Pretty uncomfortable to use in the underarm area, as you would expect.  Lots of special covers, and the instructions are not really clear; but with diligence you can figure it out.  I think to get a clean hairless face, leg or underarm, I probably need to initially use it daily to catch hairs as they reach sufficient length for it to remove them.  Am sure after a while, I will be able to decrease the frequency of use as it removes hairs that grow back.  Patience is the key, and I understand developing a tolerance for the discomfort in delicate areas.  Will continue to use, and believe it will do exactly as professed.  Not disappointed; but hair removal is just a difficult, painful process.</li>
    <li> Save lots of my time for waxing ! And i can do it whenever i need. Just take 5 mins</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators for 25 years and this is the best model ever. If you have used an epilator for any time you know the hair grows back finer and less year after year the other models and brands I have used had trouble pulling out all the fine hair. This model gets them all.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and different heads for different parts of the body make it very versatile and worth the money</li>
    <li> i still have to shave after i use this. i have a high pain tolerance to most things but this hurts!! it does keep the hair away longer than shaving, but it&#x27;s not what i imagined. it doesnt get all the hair and i have to do it about twice a week which seems pointless since shaving gets all the hair right away.</li>
    <li> The product was as expected. It did as was expected. My wife is using it and she is totally in love with it.. She has been using it for over an year now and has no issues with it. Only thing is that initially its a little painful but becomes ok after some usage and under arms is murder :D</li>
    <li> Well lady&#x27;s this is an epilator and it is going to hurt a little for the first time or so. But I can tell you it is so worth it!!!! Cause you will get used to it and get to enjoy being hair free for really long.....and I did buy this Braun Epilator and didn&#x27;t get paid to try it ;-) in my opinion this is the best one out there.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used the dry epilator only on my legs and it worked so well and was not uncomfortable at all.  I highly recommend this product for hair removal.</li>
    <li> It gave me a horrible rash and was so painful. I returned after one use.  I normally get a slight rash after waxing but this was horrible. I would rather have hairy arms than the rash</li>
    <li> She said: &amp;#34;It&#x27;s amazing!&amp;#34;  And it works especially well on the upper lip.  Use frequently, as the shorter the hair, the less pain you&#x27;ll feel.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Good quality. Been reliable so far.</li>
    <li> Exceeds my expectations, hairs that grow back are finer and less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have been using one of the old model of Braun epilator for a very long time (almost 12 years). It is still running good. But I wanted to get an upgraded model as the old one is not as fast. After buying the Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator I have been using it for legs, hands, underarms, bikini and upper lips &amp; face. Its amazing how quickly I can get epilating done. I take lesser time to epilate than it would take for waxing. Its very easy and comfortable. It also better when used in shower (it hurts a little less).  Initially cleaning was a pain, but then I started running the epilator heads under the water and it cleans a little quicker. I hope Braun comes up with a better design to clean the heads. The only other downside is that after fully charged you can use it for about 40 mins until it runs out of charge - but then so far I have never run out of charge without fully epilating. I find that 40 mins is enough to do my full legs and bikini (considering I haven&#x27;t epilated/shaved for a long time). Update (July 2015): the epilator head stopped working. The motor is fine but the head stopped rotating. There was no damage on the product. I think the gears inside maybe worn out. This is less than 2 years of use. Braun- why is your product not as good as before??  Update(Jan 2016): I had purchased insurance on this product so I got a refund and I purchased a new one (same model). I still continue using this regularly and love it. Its more expensive than what I paid for 2-3 years ago but worth it.</li>
    <li> Thanks have always used Braun epilator.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical reading that this would be appropriate to use in the shower, but I gave it a try and WOW!  This has totally changed my morning routine.  This little beauty is a must have to ensure a close, smooth shave with minimal effect.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, works well, less noisy and painful.</li>
    <li> There was a lot of debate in our household about this product before I decided to bite the bullet and buy it for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three months now, she would not be without this epilator and thinks it’s a brilliant product, but she was so very nervous (to put it mildly) before first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For her first use she did the following and this helped massively:&lt;br /&gt;-Shaved her legs a week before she wanted to epilate: for my wife this mean her hairs were the perfect length the following week, not too long and not too short for the epilator to grab!&lt;br /&gt;-Watched the Braun video on how to epilate: this told her what angle to hold it at as well as the kind of speed she should move the epilator at&lt;br /&gt;-Epilated whilst in the bath: the warm water not only allowed for easier hair removal but soothed her legs a little after&lt;br /&gt;-Used shave gel: the Braun website recommended this, and it made the whole process smoother and more comfortable&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturised her legs afterwards: this helped with the soothing process afterwards&lt;br /&gt;-Had ibuprofen to hand if the pain was going to be too much… but it wasn’t thankfully&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was especially nervous as she has never even had a leg wax before, which a friend had suggested would help. Ignoring this advice though she was fine taking all the above steps into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did experience some very mild stinging, which was helped by moisturising afterwards, and the day after epilating her legs were so smooth, she was over the moon and decided the mild discomfort was definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first epilation was the most difficult and since then she has epilated her legs weekly and after only two weeks she felt confident enough to epilate her legs dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The discomfort she feels now is ‘barely noticeable’, and again she makes sure she moisturises her legs afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilating is so much easier than shaving and my wife has noticed the small hairs that grow back do appear much finer, they seem to be weakening. She has yet to experience any ingrowing hairs or indeed any drawbacks to epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently as she epilates more she will need to do it less frequently but each week there is the odd, very small hair and she wants rid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommendedck do appear much finer, they seem to be weakening. She has yet to experience any ingrowing hairs or indeed any drawbacks to epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently as she epilates more she will need to do it less frequently but each week there is the odd, very small hair and she wants rid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> BUT, it gets better(:  I recently just bought this epilator and was shaving all the time before it.  Where I notice the most difference (because I use it the most on this body part) is my armpits!!!  My armpits before using the epilator were verrry dark!  I hated them, and theyve been like that since I started shaving them, which was many many years ago! lol.  I remember hating having to raise my hand in class because I didnt want anyone to see them!  It was embarrassing.  Well, GOODBYE dark armpits!  I&#x27;ve only used this epilator for about a month &amp; there is a noticeable difference!  I also used it on my arms, legs, and face. The hair took longer to grow back than it usually does and I&#x27;m happy(:  HOWEVER. Be careful when using it on your face!  I used it on my mustache (lol) and sideburns (because theyre soo long) and it was fine until the next morning!  I had tiny red bumps all over my face!  It went away completely in like 2 weeks.  It took a couple of days just for the redness to go away.  I read online that I was probably supposed to wet my face with cold water after epilating so that my pores would close ( I didnt do that so my pores were left open).  However, I havent tried this again so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll work!</li>
    <li> this is great and it works well! keeps hair off for weeks! the price is great and it is cheaper than multiple waxes</li>
    <li> Effective hair removal, still far from permanent though.  I have to use this at least once sometimes twice a week to maintain smooth legs.  Still beats shaving every day though.  Much less expensive than laser treatments.  As far as the pain factor with epilating; yeah it hurts a bit at first, but after you use this a couple times you and your skin both adapt to it.</li>
    <li> When I received this product,  I was very excited to try it.  When I opened the box,  I got even more excited when I realized that it has a built-in light and the speed setting(two speed setting)  is very easy  to control.  I like how It clicks to the next speed,  instead of those slide buttons. It has 5 attachment heads,  a bag and a brush that is in perfect size to clean the attachment heads.  The attachment heads are supposed to help prevent broken skin and make the epilating experience less painful and intimidating. Each attachment head is for certain parts of the body; so before using this epilator,  be sure to read the manual carefully.This epilator is rechargeable which is great if your going away for the weekend and you want to pack light!  Now,  I have already tried it to remove facial hair,  leg hair and armpit hair, and let me tell you,  this is the best epilator I have ever used! When I used it on my face,  it definitely got rid of my mustache! (not that,  it was a lot,  but I get very conscious about it.  And the hair wasn&#x27;t even long,  I can barely see it!) it left the top of my upper lip red but not irritated for only a few minutes. (I was actually worried that it was gonna stay red until the next day because I have very sensitive skin). The next day,  I used it on my leg using the attachment  that is specifically for the epilating the legs. I had to go really slow and against the hair growth because my leg hair isn&#x27;t really that long. (leg hair and armpit hair needs to be at least,  half a centimeter to achieve best results.) it didn&#x27;t really hurt,  the attachment head makes it less intimidating to use the epilator. Then I tried it on my armpit,  and Lo and behold! No broken skin! No bleeding,  no skin irritation,  not even any sign of redness!  I was very impressed!  I gave it a four star because the manual,  in my own opinion isn&#x27;t very user friendly.  The drawings for the attachment heads are a little confusing.  I also had to read the manual every time I had to change the attachment head,  which to me is a little annoying,  but it was worth it! Overall,  this is a great epilator! Probably,  one of the best in the market! It&#x27;s great for someone who will be using an epilator for the first time!</li>
    <li> Works just like the description!  Great epilator and affordable.  Having the option for wet or dry makes this versatile and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting wet.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to.  Very rare these days to find a product that works.</li>
    <li> Amazing work. Every girl should have it</li>
    <li> I have very fine blonde leg hair and this takes forever to remove even only 50% of the hair.  Legs don&#x27;t feel very smooth afterwards either because a good bit of the hair isn&#x27;t even removed.  I bought this for underarm hair and it works decently well for that, but leaves red bumps for more than just overnight for me.  I tried on bikini area and the pain honestly was just too unbearable there and left horrible ingrown hairs even with alcohol and exfoliation.  I use the epilator for under arms only and the shaver head for everywhere else.  Honestly, save your money and buy a nice shaver and a cheaper epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the hair I remove easily grows back within 3-4 days and epilation takes about 10 minutes for underarm, 30 for legs.  So it&#x27;s a time commitment too! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I eat a ton of veggies and vitamins, but my hair just grows back too fast for spending this much time epilating and not getting super great results.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I have no complaint. It removes unwanted hair in a breeze. The thing is I&#x27;m not a person who has a lot of body hair so it works perfectly for fine body hair like mine. I&#x27;m not sure how is it going to work with a person with lots of body hair or coarse hair. I can tell that it would hurt..</li>
    <li> PAINFUL! but makes your legs really smooth if you can stand a little pain for beauty..and my pain i mean a tattoo like feeling?..waxing would feel the same, but this wont rip skin and actually gets more hair. ...i recommend using a spray pain reliever from a pharmacy like &amp;#34;dermoblast&amp;#34; or walgreens brand/cvs brand equivalent afterwards to relieve red looking rash from literally pulling hair out. Results seem to last two weeks, not the six weeks as expected but even so, hair grows back less &#x27;spikey&#x27; and noticable&lt;br /&gt;  **i would not recommend for underarm use or bikini unless you enjoy pain**</li>
    <li> I wouldnt be without it. Worth every single dollar i spent on it. Bikini line not the best but will put that down to inexperience. Lots of ingrown hairs so will go back to waxing. Found that the cream used for&lt;br /&gt;numbing tatoo skin works perfectly well for epilation to manage pain. Seriously, buy this. Its the best investment i have made in body hair management.</li>
    <li> Arrived fairly quickly. Battery lasts a lot longer than stated. Easy to use and clean and a lot better than waxing. Can be painful at first, but once one gets used to it it&#x27;s not so bad even on facial hair. I do recommend you make sure that your skin is clean and clear of any debris...a warm shower after feels great to calm down the possible pain.</li>
    <li> Love it. I was doing waxing but now I would recommend using Braun. it saves so much time. first time it was little painful but now it has become easy and less time consuming.</li>
    <li> No it doesn&#x27;t get every hair out by the roots but it does do one heck of a job. I&#x27;ve used it on arms, legs and private areas and I can go a few days up to a week without shaving again. Electrolysis only does black hair this gets them all! I&#x27;m feeling less  hair regrowing in and I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now (about half come back).yay!!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Let me start this off my saying if you want an epilator, this is a fantastic product. It comes with all the attachments you would need for any body area and a bag to hold them. I love that it is wet or dry and can be fully submersed in water (this is a necessity for me). It has 2 settings...I really only use the higher setting because I am impatient and have to go too slow across my skin with the lower setting. It charges quickly and the battery lasts quite a while even when using it under water. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking at epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used an epilator, I have a few thoughts on them in general. This is my first time ever using an epilator and I had no idea what I was in for. I have always had a very big issue with razor burn and my skin is extremely sensitive and dry (I have eczema). Because of how bad my razor burn is, I was having to always buy bathing suits with shorts and often wouldn&#x27;t even wear shorts if my legs were acting up. I also would get extremely painful razor burn on my underarms and I wouldn&#x27;t wear sleeveless shirts because of it. I tried shaving, waxing, hair removal cream, everything. I read many reviews about Epilators being painful to start but the results being worth it because the hairs come back finer and sparse...that is very true, especially the PAIN part! I have a very high pain tolerance and I struggled to get this going but I was determined knowing that this was my last hope for hair removal without damaging my skin. It makes a huge difference with the pain to use it underwater (I tried both dry and wet). I highly recommend using it in the bath tub. It hurts REALLY bad the first 2-3 times because you are pulling thick hairs out (from years of shaving) and a lot of them. If you use it weekly for the first month, it because less painful each time. I have been using mine for a couple months now and it is tolerable. It still hurts, but I don&#x27;t spend an hour and a half doing my legs having to give myself pep talks every 30 seconds. The results from using this for 2 months is amazing. The hair grows back thinner and very sporadically located, so you are not having to pull as many hairs out when you use it. I am to the point that I use it once every 1-2 weeks and I am not self conscious about my legs in between because you can hardly see or feel the hair that is there. I get red dots that last less than 24 hours afterward but other than that...NO RAZOR BURN. It is AMAZING!!! I am so happy that I finally found something I can use. I still have not built up the strength to use it in my underarms because the pain is too much...I am building up to that in the next couple months. I recently was able to use it in my bikini area but that took a lot of pep-talks. My suggestion...go with the hair and take tiny sections at a time before moving to the next inch. Ultimately, if you can tolerate pain, epilators are amazing. But it is not for everyone.</li>
    <li> Not as great as I had hoped, but it has reduced shaving.  The problem is letting the hair grow out long enough to use the epilator and that&#x27;s hard to do in the summer time.  I don&#x27;t think this one works as well as my old Braun.  I have to go over the same area many times.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that you can&#x27;t use this one when it&#x27;s plugged in.  It has to be charged to use.  I guess they want to make sure you don&#x27;t use it in the shower or tub because it&#x27;s also a &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; epilator.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I am a hairy Armenian woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using epilators since I could drive because it really is the only way I can get rid of the hair without having to shave everyday. I used to have another brand epilator but it crapped out and after a lot of research I bought this beauty. I use it on my face, legs, arms, underarms, and privates. It is incredibly easy to clean using hot water and I love it immensely. Now, knowing fully well that my facial hair is coarser than other peoples. this thing HURT when I first used it on my face, no where else did it hurt as much. Luckily, true to epi fashion it only hurt the first few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- LONG battery life&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Versatility&lt;br /&gt;- Removes ALL of hair (when not in shower)&lt;br /&gt;- Interchangeable heads allow for selective grooming&lt;br /&gt;- Light comes in handy (thought it would be a waste of time but it shows you ALL of the hairs!)&lt;br /&gt;- Nice size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- When in the shower, it is hit or miss whether the hairs will be pulled out or clipped accidentally. Lathering and then epilating while the soap is still on the area seemed to help though.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t work while plugged in. I understand this is a safety feature because it&#x27;s a wet/dry but I liked  with my other epilator being able to charge it while in use on the off chance it ran low because I stupidly forgot to charge it after a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I LOVE this epilator. It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t any louder than other epilators on the market and if you lather while in the shower this thing is great anywhere.</li>
    <li> I knew the epilator would work perfectly because I used a similar model before, but this one includes a shaver, very very useful!</li>
    <li> Worth the money.  Efficient, effective, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works great for everything except facial hair. It makes the area rough to the touch, like a man&#x27;s face feels from shaving.</li>
    <li> Takes a long time to use some parts pop off and it can be a pain in the ass sometimes but over all it&#x27;s better thin the rest</li>
    <li> trimmer head is not working. Instead of trimming hairs its plucking hairs so painful.Since guarantee is only for one year,requesting manufacture to send link for new trimmer head.i want to purchase it as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> I had an old Braun Epilator that started to slow down and was not as effective than before. I bought this one and I just love it. It fits nicely in your hand and do a outstanding job removing the hairs in all areas. Hopefully, I will keep it as long as the previous one around 10 years!</li>
    <li> I have tried the Epil 5 before and that was extremely painful. This is a bit less painful than the Epil 5 but in my opinion, it is not worth the price. It does come with a lot of nice accessories including pre-epil wipes. What is nice about this is that you charge it up and then use it so you don&#x27;t have to have a cord plugged into it in order to use it, which was a problem with the Epil 5 from what I remember. However, you cannot use this while it is charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this with my legs, underarms, and my bikini area. The underarms are still a little bit stingy from it but my legs are nice and smooth now. This does get hot really easily and within a few minutes, it was already running hot and slightly burning my skin. It does the job like it advertises but I think the price is a bit ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I love this little guy! It&#x27;s my life saver and a time consumption tool.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this thing. I was wasting money messy on at home wax kits, hair removal creams, and just about everything else, because i was sick of having to shave everyday...Then I came across this wonderful thing. Finally something that actually works!! I must admit It does hurt the first time you use it but after that its a piece of cake, and it is so worth it. Drink a glass of wine and get to epilating :) Say goodbye to buying razors, say goodbye to one day hair growth, and say goodbye to stubble. The first couple times you use it you may have to use it everyday but that is because hair grows back at different times. So its not the hair you already tweezed, its just hair that hasn&#x27;t been removed yet. Once you get it all done though it takes long time to grow back, and when it does its not all stubbly because it pulls the hair from the root. My armpit hair is like softer and thinner and takes like a month to even start growing back. Every girl should have one of these.</li>
    <li> Really good to have. It helps a lot</li>
    <li> Started using this epilator 3 years ago, haven&#x27;t shaved since. After about two years,  battery started to loose it&#x27;s ability to hold charge, and the motor wasn&#x27;t as quick. A year later, the the epilator stopped working all together.  I tried asking braun for a replacement battery and replacing it myself with guidance from youtube video- but braun does not sell replacement batteries in the U.S. Batteries plus did not have a replacement battery either- they disassembled it, looked at the battery, and said they don&#x27;t have it, and upon re-assembly, inserted the battery in the wrong way- which fried the electronics. So, I didn&#x27;t have a chance to see if I can find the battery on amazon and replace it myself. Bought the exact same epilator as a replacement.</li>
    <li> but we live in Denmark. We get the wrong adaptor. We need a 2 pole for Denmark, not 2 pole USA.</li>
    <li> very nice product,.. epiliation doesnt hurt at all.. i just love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this since more than a month and this is excellent. It removes the hair from the root and keeps my skin smooth. The growth of the hair has reduced as well. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I gave a 1 star because this is the lowest it can go. This item really rates into half star. I bought the 7 piece and thought it was going to be perfect since I was fishing out $100USD + for this item ($650+ in my currency). Not only does it not keep the charge for long but it&#x27;s one of the most painful epilators out there (I have bought a total of 4)... Most of the hairs do not come out at once and have to go over the spot a couple times ...and neither does it do a clean job as my legs or arms will feel prickly the next day which usually doesn&#x27;t happen with the others ...presently the only piece I use is the shaver/trimmer if I&#x27;m in a rush and need to do a quick clean... However even this does not give me a clean as a razor or other electric shaver would ... The half star I awarded it only goes for the light on the epilator which helps picking up areas which shadows from my washroom light would usually hide. Certainly a 0.5 out of 5 stars for this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months. The first time, I thought I was going to die. My legs were extremely red after and still burned slightly. The next morning they were slightly red, but not bad (I have red skin as it is). My legs stayed smooth for about a week, maybe a little over (my hair grows extremely fast). However, after the first time, I had a ton of ingrown hairs (something I&#x27;m already prone to, but nearly as much). I was upset, but I exfoliated and kept at it. This hasn&#x27;t been a problem since. The second time around it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad. My legs weren&#x27;t as red either. I did try this on my armpits and couldn&#x27;t get half way done with one before I was dying from the pain and my armpit was left bloody. No thank you. So, I&#x27;ve only used it on my legs, top of my feet and toes, and my upper lips. All turns out great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Be warned though it hurts (a lot!!) especially on the body (hands/legs, etc.).  It worked especially great on the face and it didn&#x27;t hurt on the face at all as it did on my arms.</li>
    <li> I used to wax my legs, under arms, and upper lip.  It cost a fortune.  No more... I love this epilator.  My sister had one and I tried it before I purchased one for myself.  Yes, it is a little expensive, but will pay for itself in no time.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator! It doesn&#x27;t get all my hairs but it gets majority of it and It makes my legs feel smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I love how it is cordless and I can use it in the shower. It works well with the underarm area once you get use to the pain.</li>
    <li> i have bought a braun razor before and had to turf it after a couple uses because all it did was cut up my face, and it didn&#x27;t seem to cut any of the hairs. i am a very hairy frenchman and didn&#x27;t really shave first, so perhaps ill have to give the epilator another chance, but all it did was put me through some extreme torture, and again it didn&#x27;t seem to remove any hairs (i did use the trimmer on a couple spots first before using the epilator). the shaver and trimmer however worked great. the shaver actually seemed to be able to shave my face and it wasn&#x27;t painful and didn&#x27;t leave me full of cuts, and the trimmer quickly and painlessly removed the bulk of the hair from my body. i was shocked to see what looked like a dead rodent sitting on my floor. now that all my hairs are fairly short ill wait a few days and try out the epilator again with the wipes and maybe ill see better results.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that actually works. First 2 times using it a little uncomfortable but from then on its quick and easy. Great on legs not game to use on underarms though. Best thing about it is you don&#x27;t have to wait as long for the hair to grow as it pulls out really short hairs too!!</li>
    <li> I especially like the picture instructions for quick reference instead of having to read what goes where when.  It does the job.  It&#x27;s pretty and the light makes seeing what is needed easy for me - 62 years.</li>
    <li> Ooooohhhh this is great. I use this on my legs and bikini area. Legs never a problem, but ouch- It hurt on my bikini area the first couple times. After that it&#x27;s been much better though. And let me tell you, IT&#x27;S WORTH IT! The hair takes weeks to grow back, and when it does it&#x27;s thin and so easy to remove! Goodbye ingrown hairs, dark, thick hairs, frequent shaving, and expensive razors! Hello to less time removing hair and smoother skin! It&#x27;s only been a couple months and this thing is already close to paying for itself because I&#x27;m only using razors for my underarms now. (Too chicken to use it there ;)</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to do</li>
    <li> The Braun SE7681 is an excellent product.  Thoroughly enjoy using it.  Has met and even exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love how quickly I am able to remove the hair from my body but my only complaint is that sometimes it just breaks the hairs rather than pulling them out. my hairs aren&#x27;t very coarse so maybe that&#x27;s the problem. I don&#x27;t this it&#x27;s painful (except the one I tried it on my face - never again! ). great product for the price. works better (for me) dry, likely because water doesn&#x27;t allow it to grip my fine hairs. recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it!! It&#x27;s great and very handy! I quickly get my whole body done in less than 20 minutes. The only thing is that if you don&#x27;t exfoliate your legs it can tend it get ingrown hairs! so make sure you exfoliate before epilating that way your results are better.</li>
    <li> Great product but too too painful.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I made this purchase a month ago.  No more shaving in the shower every morning!  I have waxed for years but surprisingly it took a few tries before I got used to using this product.  I think its the speed and the sound that&#x27;s different.  My suggestion is to start with a less fragile area, get comfortable and move on to other sites from there.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I love it with pain!!!  It hurts to pull the hairs, so I use it where I can.  It is worth the pain though.</li>
    <li> Clearly a superior product. I have been an Epilady customer for seven years and have gone through MANY products.  The latex only lasted eight months.  While I have only had the Braun for two months, it has out performed the Epilady by far.  It provides a much closer epilation, leaving the skin smooth rather than a bit stubbly.  The charge lasts longer and I love the safety &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; feature.  I can&#x27;t sing the praises of the product enough.  All areas in which I use it is great.  And I use it everywhere possible.</li>
    <li> I have not tried this wet, yet.  But it works excellent dry to shave.  I&#x27;m still getting used to the discomfort using the epilator, but okay on my legs.  I have recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators for years now and this is the best I have found. I&#x27;m also a shopaholic so I have been through quite a few different brands! In terms of expense, it&#x27;s well worth it for simply what you are getting. This comes with a razor head which comes in handy for trimming before using the epilator on extremely sensitive areas. Also the fact that it is waterproof is probably the biggest bonus. Soaking the area in warm water to open the follicles really helped me with the &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; factor. I keep the area underwater when using it as well. Cleanup is a breeze because the entire unit is waterproof. Each attachment cap pops off and rinses clean. Over time the unit loses efficiency and battery life, but I always return for their latest model!</li>
    <li> Happy with the results, though bit of running around to find an international conversion power adaptor to plug in to charge it up, obviously not manufactured for Australian power outlets.&lt;br /&gt;Also found the epilator wont work when its plugged into the wall, so you cant keep it fully charged up permanently while in use, for as long as needed to keep going til finished areas wanted, so it runs out fairly fast and then has to be fully charged up again for couple of hours before it will switch back on again. Thought i had a faulty one at first when it wldnt switch on even when plugged into the outlet, had to fully charge it up first which is bit inconvenient to wait, otherwise epilator works great on the legs. The light is excellent for seeing area working on.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Best purchase ever!!</li>
    <li> Ok, first let me say... OUCHY! but.....  no pain no gain!  the pain is worth it if you ask me. For me, the trick is to do this after you&#x27;ve showered and before you put lotion on your legs (if you do that right out of the shower). And don&#x27;t let your hair get too long because this will hurt even more! down by the ankle where it meets the foot is where the most pain seemed to be. Wowsers! I find by screaming profanities it somewhat helps! LOL  and breathing deeply like you&#x27;re in labor might also help too! hahahaha  It does get easier with continued use. Its also really great for the underarms. I was so scared to use it there but I figured, heck, I had two kids, this should be a walk in the park, right? well kinda. Every now and then it grabs some hairs that will make you jump but it definitely keeps your underarms smoother much longer! and if you have the darker underarms I can see how this would help that. Luckily I don&#x27;t have that problem. My 13 yr daughter tried it on her underarms and didn&#x27;t this is was bad so that must tell you something. She didn&#x27;t try it on her legs though because she was too scared. It probably didn&#x27;t help that I would freak out when doing my own legs LOL. The charge seems to last long for me. I can do all of my legs and underarms on one charge. Oh and if you pull your skin taught while doing it, it seems to help a little as well. I think...  or it could be my imagination! Its like labor, you forget about the pain until you go through it again! teeheehee  hope this helps for those women thinking about trying it. This is not like the olden days when they first came out with the epilator. This is light years better!</li>
    <li> If I bought this again, I&#x27;d go for the one with fewer bells and whistles. I don&#x27;t use any attachment but the regular epilator one and I find the light too bright, it hurts my eyes. I will figure out how to disable it. I found that the swivelly nature of the head did not improve the use of this product. It caused the epilator to catch on my skin and miss hairs. I thought this things didn&#x27;t work too well until I started holding the head in place so it didn&#x27;t swivel - that&#x27;s when I got good, consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good product, made in Germany, but go for the cheaper version w/o the bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> Best epilator I have ever tried. Doesn&#x27;t hurt and it exceeded all my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Was unsure between this one and the Phillips one, but I&#x27;m glad I chose the Braun.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it!!!!! Highly recomended!!</li>
    <li> I am doing electrolysis on my legs, and I used to wax everything else. Right now I use this all the time, everywhere. I have couple more sessions of electrolysis to do, before I am all hair free, but until I do them, I am using this on legs too.</li>
    <li> In the beginning it seemed wonderful, specially because of the fact it is wireless and uses recharcheable batteries. However, I could only use it for less than six months before having to send it for repair, as the battery would no longer charge. Got it back with epilator head replaced, it seemed fine. Another couple of months later, the battery is dead again and no longer charges. On top of that, the charger comes with a plug that will not fit anywhere, the two round pins that look European are too big for the sockets they have there or in South America, where the standard is the same. You will need an adaptor anyway. So it was a total disappointment, waste of money and BRAUN does not even reply to messages of complaint. Lame customer service. I had to rate it one star because of its design, that is all.[[ASIN:B0077PLNNE Braun Se7681 Silk-Epil 7681 Wet and Dry Epilator, White]]</li>
    <li> 1st time owner/user and am very happy with my purchase, took a little time to figure out how to use it but wouldn&#x27;t hesistate to recommend.</li>
    <li> This product does pretty well. It does leave some of the finer hairs behind and it doesn&#x27;t grab the shorter hairs as well as described (they need to be a little longer or maybe I just expected more). All in all, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use and no pain !</li>
    <li> This is much more painful than waxing, because instead of yanking many hairs out in a split second, it does yank them one at a time. Yes, it&#x27;s as painful as epilation has ever been. That being said, I get tired of the mess of wax, I get occasional skin tears from wax strips, and I can use this a little bit every couple of days rather than waiting a week or two, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much. It&#x27;s still a torture device. Thank you again, mixed European heritage, for my little mustache. The eyebrows will still have to be waxed, because of the precision needed for shaping them. This machine is more for an &#x27;area&#x27; than a &#x27;shape.&#x27;</li>
    <li> Not the best solution but pretty good for the ones whose nightmare is unwanted hairs. It is also perfect to use it at shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over 2 years now and it still works. However, after a year, the battery started discharging after using it 5 minutes. So now I have to stop every 5 minutes and charge it for an hour which is very inconvenient. Now worth the money because my old one lasted me 5 years!</li>
    <li> I was tired of the daily shaving and waxing breaks the bank, so I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try.  I am so glad I purchased, it works as advertised on legs, bikini line, underarms and face... wonderful product.</li>
    <li> In the event that you need to buy a gift for someone that you absolutely despise... look no further.You have officially found the worst and most painful piece of garbage on the face of the planet.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this, was shocked at how painful it was to use, but stuck with it. 2 days later, I finally finished the initial use. My legs were swollen. It was horrendous. But the thought of not having to shave as frequently was a big draw.&lt;br /&gt;I legit gave this thing a month of serious trials. I exfoliated, and read the instructions.I cleaned it, charged it and tried desperately to like it. But No. Just No.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, as other reviewers have noted, it \\&quot;runs out of batteries after 45 minutes and needs to be recharged\\&quot; why does it take that long?? IT TAKES A REALLY LONG TIME TO EVEN FINISH ONE LEG. Plus, if you like smooth legs then fuhgeddaboudit. You will never get smooth legs with this thing. So your 1. causing pain.2. causing pain forrrrreeeeeevvvvvvverrrrr. and 3. causing pain forrrrrreeeeeeevvvvvvveeeerrrrr to get picky legs.&lt;br /&gt;You have been warned. I just warned you.</li>
    <li> I love the results I&#x27;ve gotten with this epilator. It has been especially effective for my underarm area!</li>
    <li> This thing hurts a lot.  I like the idea but it hurts too much to use. I&#x27;ve never used this type of product, but this hurts more than waxing, plucking, etc that I have done.  I have a high pain tolerance but at the same time very sensitive reactive skin that turns red easily.  I really wanted to like this.</li>
    <li> I love it so much. Not much pain at all. Plus, when the hair grow  back, it is much more thinner and softer.</li>
    <li> It hurts less than Emjoi, costs about the same and does a much better job. Even did my underarms with this. The attachments are great, and it&#x27;s easy to clean. A single charge gives you enough time to do both legs completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before but I read all about them and I&#x27;ve gotten waxed plenty of times so I figured I was ready. I. WAS. NOT. READY for this thing. It should be classified as a torture device and all you ladies that use it regularly are bad-ass. Maybe I didn&#x27;t give it a fair shot, I tried it for about five seconds on a flat part of my leg and that&#x27;s about all I could handle. Then I tried it on a few happy trail hairs on my stomach figuring the sparsity would be easier to manage and it was more okay but I honestly think I&#x27;d rather just go in with tweezers one by one. There&#x27;s no way this is going anywhere near my bikini line or armpits like I had originally intentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side, it also comes with a really really good shaver attachment. I&#x27;m literally keeping it just for that. It&#x27;s a fantastic electric shaver, gets a smoother shave on my leg than the Norelco electric razor my brother uses on his face (I may have borrowed his in the name of science) It&#x27;s not as close of a shave as your regular blade in the shower, but it&#x27;s about 95% as good and you can use it dry. Perfect for a quick touch up or if you don&#x27;t have time to go shower and shave. Oh the light is surprisingly useful and I&#x27;ve used it at least a dozen times since getting it out of the box and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please hit &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; below:</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and easy to maintain.  I highly recommend it for hair removal.</li>
    <li> I really like this Epilator.  I love that it has all different heads to do various kinds of shaving.  The Epilator works great, it took the hair off and so far in over a week it has not come back.  I will love this a lot as shaving is something I always dread.  Thanks Braun for once a device does as it  says it will do.</li>
    <li> The best purchase I have made.</li>
    <li> Well first off it hurts like a m*****f*** but it does work great, hair seems to grow back after 2days very disappointed at that. What happened to weeks of smooth skin even with exfoliate? I still use it though every 3 days and grit my teeth.. waxing last longer to me</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do that great of job, misses a lot of spots. Some other method is probably better for me to use.</li>
    <li> Before buying it I read reviews and it gave the impression that the product was wanderful.&lt;br /&gt;After trying it I realize it was not. It cuts the hair, and the speed is high to very high. I would have preferred a lower speed.&lt;br /&gt;It has the advantage that you can use it in water and as well lots of accessories to cut further your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Definitively it is not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Almost 2 months ago I bought this epilator, my first ever. I read some of the other costumer review and was pretty worried about the pain.&lt;br /&gt;Now I know it&#x27;s real, the first time pain in the underarm and , I was sure I will use it just on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the result I decided I wanna keep using my epilator no matter the pain (I was asking for help so I needed no to do it wet..., now you can imaging), surprisingly I felt no pain and I get \\&quot;in love\\&quot; with my new epil :D and since the first time I&#x27;ve being able to use it even on my dry legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the times I do it dry and really love how smooth my skin gets at the end, I just get my shower with an scrub foam (don&#x27;t know if is the correct english word for this...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some day soon I will do my bikini area (I&#x27;ve heard it do not hurts as much as underarm....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I really recommend this product. It&#x27;s fast and no pain after the first time hahaha...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----Para las que no hablan inglés y realmente quieren saber si comprarlo o no, solo puedo decir que esta es mi primer depiladora y que realmente me encantó, al inicio las axilas me dolieron mucho requirió valentía pero la segunda, 3er, etc vez que los usé olvidé lo que era dolor... la uso normalmente en seco en mis piernas y axilas.... pronto trataré de nuevo en la zona del bikini (espero)... Para mi el simple hecho de no depilarme tan seguido las axilas y que no quede la sombra negra y hasta que percibo menos sudor han hecho que cada dólar valga la pena.</li>
    <li> This beats shaving any day!! It takes a while to get used to epilating but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Her feedback on this item is that the shave was easy, it&#x27;s easy to clean and the charge time is fast and long-lasting - though she complained that there were too many plastic parts you don&#x27;t really need. She added that if it&#x27;s not really an improvement on using a razor blade but good for travelling or when you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  the only remark maybe is the bag/packing the product comes with.  It is not the same as previous models.  But the epilator is great.</li>
    <li> I know, I&#x27;m a guy. But I like my chest shaved for when I go swimming. I was tired of taking a Bic to it and decided to try Epilating. And, wow, it hurt! But it was nice and smooth, too. Plus, the hair didn&#x27;t start growing back as fast, so I didn&#x27;t have to tend to it as often as I did with the razor. Subsequent uses hurt also, but as I use it more and more it has become more comfortable. Either that or I&#x27;m just getting more use to the pain; I still don&#x27;t consider it a highlight of my month by a long shot, but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an epilator, I&#x27;d suggest this one. I do hope they can come up with less painful ones in the future and will be keeping an eye out for newer models.</li>
    <li> Very good quality product. Has a lot of options and preferences. My wife loved this gift. Its worth the extra money for this product.</li>
    <li> I had one of BrAuns&#x27;s older model (bought for half of the price I paid for this one) and that one also was a good epilator. Pros of this model are that you can clean it by washing and use it when showering. What I dont like is the twisting speed button (up&amp;down button on previous model was way more convenient), the close grip is good (not sure how it will work on thin and short hair), but I do love the quality of the trimmer head that comes with the package. Overall good product just a bit overpriced.</li>
    <li> I purchased this epilator because I was sick of shaving every other day. Even with this item, I have found my hair still grows back pretty quick. I have to use this at least once a week. I&#x27;ve been using it every week for the past 3-4 months and I&#x27;m still not used to the pain or discomfort that I get while using it. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, however, and that&#x27;s the most important part.</li>
    <li> This product works great on dry skin, but does not really do much in shower or on wet skin. It would also be handy if you could use the product while it was being charged, however I do understand for safety reasons (I&#x27;m sure there are people out there who would use it while being charged under running water lol) the device cannot be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair does come back finer, but as with waxing, you do need to exfoliate your skin often to prevent ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to other epilators with price and performance, I would probably stick with this one because it can be cleaned under water and it performs well.</li>
    <li> It works but it it hurts like hell.  Left red bumps all over for days.  My legs looked like I had measles.  Illl stick with a razor that gets silky smooth for a few days.</li>
    <li> Totally happy with the Silk-Epil.  Should have bought it earlier.  I have to admit though that I only use it for my legs.  I get bumps in the face but I do get that with any other method of hair removal therefore I would say that is only my personal problem.  At the beginning it is uncomfortable but now the more I use it the more I love it because now I only go back about once a week.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t epillate well. Not al of the hair comes off. Not a smooth finish . Not worth wasting ones money on this. Very disappointing .</li>
    <li> I love it so easy to use and my legs look great for 2-3 weeks. My legs were a little red after the fist use for 2 days. The pain is completely manageable. After the 2nd use, my legs were not as red... Great product and bye-bye shaving every 2/3 days!</li>
    <li> Good product! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> great product! I just got it and tried it immediately! It works perfectly. It is actually my first epilator and I was very scared. I tried it on my legs and underarms FOR THE FIRST TIME, and there was some pain,but its bearable! Trust me! Also I was worried that I would have red bumps , but 10 minutes after epilation, they disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth the money and the quality.</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator. Out of package it was had all the attachments listed. I think it hurt more with the attachments than without them. I usually don&#x27;t let my hair grow that long but this epilator wasn&#x27;t able to get the tiny hair with the attachments. I felt that it worked better without the attachment head for tiny hair. REturning it and trying another one. It definitely saved more time and hassle than waxing so would like to try another brand.</li>
    <li> The product itself works quite well. I use it mostly on my underarms and legs. It fits nicely in my hand, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it&#x27;s convenient to have the various heads. It is painful though, the supposed massaging it claims to do doesn&#x27;t really make the epilating any less painful/uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> For my first time using an epilator, I was honestly very scared as to how painful it would be, but the pre-epilation wipes helped the process run very well. Also, I liked that this item came with a neat carrying bag, and several other epilator heads. It was definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am so disgusted with this item! I was so excited to get an Epilator and try it out but the battery life is crap. At first it did just fine but now I can barely spend any time with it before the battery life dies. Sometimes it will die on me right when I am using it on my face area and it will tug the skin in and hold it there which really hurts. Plus, on my legs if I try to even use it it leaves horrible red bumps. I would much rather use a razor and that is saying something for me! Honestly, if I could give this product no stars, I would. So disappointed I waited to long to return it. But I hope that this review will help people if they are thinking of getting this product.</li>
    <li> Heaven sent!!!! Excellent! It did exactly what it says! It can pluck out the smallest of hairs with NO discomfort! Great product!!!!! Best epilator on the market! I have used different epilators for 20 years! This is THE BEST ONE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Soooo much better than a razor. Smoother longer and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The best! (According to my wife)</li>
    <li> I used to have a small epilator for my face.  It worked okay sometimes but I decided I wanted to try one for my legs and this one had the best reviews.  So far it works well on my legs and is amazing on my face.  It is somewhat painful the first couple of times on your legs.</li>
    <li> It works great! Admittedly the first time feels like using a cheese grater against your skin, but after that it&#x27;s easy and mostly painless.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be better being one of the latest models; i had to go over the same spot 3-5 times; my 6 year old epilady did a better job.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time and so far i like it.  I didn&#x27;t shave for 2 days.  It removed most of the hair, but it took longer than expected. I used the slow setting for a while, then i realized that it wasn&#x27;t as painful on the faster setting.</li>
    <li> I am a first time epilator. Here are my experiences thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNDERARMS: I bought this mostly for use on my underarms as I wanted a clean, no-darkness-from-hairs-under-the-skin look. I&#x27;ve had my underarms waxed a few times and this feels like getting a hundred first-time waxes over the span of 4 minutes. It is PAINFUL. The first time I did it I got many ingrown hairs but they came to the surface quickly. The second time I got only a couple of ingrown hairs but again, they came to the surface quickly. The third time no ingrown hairs. It hurts every time but with less growth/density it hurts less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACE: I also bought this product to get rid of my sideburns/cheek hair that has plagued me for the majority of my hairy brown girl life. I never did anything to it until last year - I&#x27;ve had it threaded a few times which hurt like hell but made everything beautiful. Anyway, the first time I epilated my face it hurt, but no more than the threading, and the next day i had a small breakout of maybe 2-3 tiny bumps that turned to whiteheads very quickly and left very light marks that I knew would go away quickly, no big deal. The second time, just over 3 weeks ago, I cleaned the device and my face with rubbing alcohol to avoid breakouts. I guess the rubbing alcohol must have irritated and dried my skin out because immediately after finishing my face I had huge, warm, reddish bumps ALL OVER my cheeks. I thought they would go away overnight but they did not. A couple days later it began to look like the worst acne of my life. It was horrible, I didn&#x27;t want to leave the house. I&#x27;m still dealing with some hyper pigmentation from the irritation but most of the bumps cleared without leaving marks. BE CAREFUL if you have sensitive skin. Do a test patch. Keep some aloe/vitamin E on hand. Even though it turned out horribly I will try again (very carefully) because the first time I was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVER: I used the shaver on my legs and it dida pretty great job. My leg hair was fully grown and pretty heavy and I had to go over some spots a few times, but I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the epilator attachment on my arms or legs yet. I will be using it on my legs soon when the growth is about half a cm, but I am nervous because of the reaction I had on my underarms - I really do not want to be dealing with ingrown hairs/red bumps on my legs! My skin is translucent and I can see the hairs underneath the skin and the follicles are already pink or brown specks. I will update this review when I build up the courage to try this.</li>
    <li> It works great, it also hurts a lot. I take a bath in hot water while i use the epilator, it seems to help</li>
    <li> This epilator works great. It is a little uncomfortable but not unbearable. You do need to use it slowly. You do get used to it. Ensure you scrub your skin down to avoid ingrown hairs. You will not have to shave for a long while between uses.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m an esthetician for 5 years, I only wax (in the last 15 years)I had a LPD treatment a while ago so all this together had my body hair in all the arias to be very rear and easy to be removed but this one catches my skin!!!! Already twice :( once when I tried to remove the hair from under my arms then the 2nd time on my bikini aria- outch!!!! Being an esthetician my hands has a lot of dexterity and I also wax myself with no issues so I can&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t know how to use it! But I had to buy this one as a 2nd option bcz I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant and I can&#x27;t really see too much for my bikini aria and my body is not as flexible either. What I think is the problem with this one is as is not really embrace the shapes of the body, the skin needs to be perfectly stretch or else you are going to get hurt and your skin caught which I belive it is Unaceptable! So I throw it out the window! I do not even care for a refund considering in how much pain I was! I&#x27;m using my old Philips Satinelle which never got my skin, even is old is still the best. So overal I do not recommend this product at all! Oh and by the way I tried all the different heads is coming with and still got my skin. No stars from my side!</li>
    <li> Just perfect! I use it to maintain my waxing. No need to go the salon anymore. I use it everyday, much easier. I help maintain it perfect.</li>
    <li> Best epilator, easy to use, great quality, battery lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Had another BRAUN epilator for more than 20 years now, and it still works.&lt;br /&gt;German engineering</li>
    <li> Generally it is described so well，but Or good&lt;br /&gt;。。。。。。。。。。。。。。&lt;br /&gt;Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, White but Color is not coquettish</li>
    <li> thought it was goin to be better than it actually really.is.&lt;br /&gt;all the hype and all&lt;br /&gt;it isnt worth the price or the effort&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt shave that close or great&lt;br /&gt;and kts sotime consuming&lt;br /&gt;id much rather just shave real quick,in the shower</li>
    <li> This epilator is one of the best in industry. You charge it and then use it without cord (like a mobile phone). It has several caps that are designed for specific body parts or trimming. You can use it on wet skin but you can&#x27;t plunge it in water. Personally I avoid using it near water. It&#x27;s an electronic device after all.&lt;br /&gt;You should read the manual carefully to see how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that, If you&#x27;re new to epilating you should know that it&#x27;s generally a painful thing to do. It&#x27;s not as easy and convenient as they show on advertisements, but you may get used to it!</li>
    <li> I like this product and would recommend it. I bought my daughter one for her birthday, she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Epil was recommended to me. I know of 4 people using it.</li>
    <li> The item works better than expected and definitely better than her previous epilator. Definitely recommends it to anyone looking for a great epilator.</li>
    <li> It hurts and bruises the skin. Ouchy. Not for me at all. I think it requires an intricate user&#x27;s manual and warnings in bold large print.</li>
    <li> The only reason that I&#x27;m rating it four stars is because it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair in just one try. You have to keep going over the spot, but otherwise it was a good epilator. If you have worries about the pain of constantly going over one spot, use the soothing wipes before and after you epilate. It helps calm redness (that fades eventually) and make your experience hurt less. I also suggest that if it is you first time trying this, don&#x27;t stop. It will hurt like the worst thing ever, but once you finish you realize it was nothing! Remember this is only needed to be done once a month.</li>
    <li> Nice, easy to use. Has almost all the necessary heads. It is easy to change them. It meets all requirements.</li>
    <li> it works well.  I don&#x27;t believe I will ever get used to the pain ! keeps legs relatively clear  - do not have to use as much as a razor.</li>
    <li> Very nice and fastest shipping thanks</li>
    <li> I love it. It is much easier to manage compared to the dry epilators as you can wash it. I love that head is angle adjustable, I don&#x27;t have to change the position of the epilator.</li>
    <li> I use this on my underarms. It hurt like hell the first few times, but now that the hair is used to it, I use it weekly. I still have yet to get the willpower to try it on the nether regions.</li>
    <li> It definitely does not feel good, but it does remove the hair. Using it while in the shower/bath will help reduce some pain. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing it immediately before going out though. You can expect small red bumps that will fade overnight. The built in light is also a very handy feature and makes it much easier to see the hair.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something much better than my old braun silk-epil and it works worst.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun epilator for 9 years. It still works, but wanted to get something newer, quicker and more powerful. In the mean time I got a Philips one, but was not satisfied with it. I&#x27;m happy I saved some money to purchase this one. Tried it yesterday and it does a great job. The money are well spent for a new Braun. I admit that it takes time to get in used with this type of epillation and some women wight not want to use it, because it hurts a little bit. But once you are used with this type of epillation, there are no problems, and the hair grows so slowly and is so fine. No more spikes.  :) Waxing takes some time to get in used to, and shaving stinks with all the razor burns, that&#x27;s why I like these epilators. And the Braun brand seems to work better than Phillips.</li>
    <li> My Silk épil 7 came today, and had to try it as soon as I opened the box (I was very happy it came  pre-charged so I could satisfy my need for instant gratification ;-)  Initial impressions: the Silk épil 7 is outstanding! I&#x27;ve been performing some combination of shaving, epilating, and/or waxing over the past many years, and this gave me the best results I&#x27;ve gotten so far! I was a little reticent at first, because I had a Braun Epil a few years ago that was just ok, but I wanted to give the new one a try, and I&#x27;m so happy I did. This Silk épil 7 has so many great features, and it&#x27;s performance exceeded my expectations. The additional accessories are a nice bonus, and the light is such a thoughtful addition (yikes! I hate to think about how much I&#x27;ve been missing with previous treatments...)  I tried it on my legs and face, and used the massaging cover as well as the sensitive area cover, and got the same great results with different combinations of accessory. I highly recommend the Braun Silk épil 7 to anyone, and look forward to using it again!  --------- 9/21/15 update:  I&#x27;ve had the Silk épil 7 for over a month, and have used it 2-3 xs per week since receiving it through a BzzAgent campaign. My first impressions still hold, this is a great epilator, with the battery life of an energizer bunny!   I had completely written off epilating several years ago after having frustrating experiences with other products (including Brauns&#x27; older models) and the Silk épil 7 has converted me back! Why you ask? There are 4 reasons: 1. The tweezing (or epilating) head is much more effective than any other I&#x27;ve tried. It grabs every hair without breaking it off, and does it quickly. I used mine for every area, and haven&#x27;t had to go over the same area more than twice. 2. The head covers!  They help to give so much more control and accuracy than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. The high-frequency massage cap has made a big difference in whether I end up with in-grown hairs (not a single one yet!) 3. The light... wow! I can only imagine what I&#x27;d been missing before! and finally, 4. The battery!! Like I mentioned, I&#x27;ve been using this 2-3x&#x27;s/week for about 6 weeks and other than the initial charge, I have NOT re-charged it yet, and it&#x27;s still going strong (if only my cell phone had a similar battery!!)   I&#x27;m thrilled with the Silk épil 7 and cannot recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> Epilating with this produces a lot of bumps and ingrowns on thick hair. Will use for shaving.</li>
    <li> The battery goes down fast and when you plug it in for charging, it does not work until it gets charged fully.</li>
    <li> This epilator works as I expected. I only use it on dry skin, however it can be used in shower I guess.</li>
    <li> Yes, yes, and more yes. This is my first epilator, and I must have read every online review for every single epilator. As a guy, I wanted to epilate my mustache regularly, and needed the best product to do it. This is truly that product. It has a ton of heads for whatever part of my body I want to use it on, and since it goes underwater, it&#x27;s super easy to clean under hot running water. Because I&#x27;ve been plucking my mustache for some time, this process was easier, but the first time hurt like a b****. Definitely worth it though after a few uses, and just remember that the first time you pluck/wax/epilate, the skin will get terribly irritated -- just like every other method. Give your body some time to adjust, and power through the pain ;-)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it since I got it. Does it&#x27;s job great and the little lite in the front is super helpful. Also the charging was so far very good. Would last me for 3-4 weeks if using once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Two points that I don&#x27;t like: The caps are pretty useless. It&#x27;s way to small and I have to take it off every time I use it on my legs. Another thing is that after using it I started to have a lot of ingrown hair. But I guess it is the process itself and not the machine. So all in all, loving it!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed. This one works fast and is much less painful than my older epilator.</li>
    <li> This hurts so bad. Not worth it at all. I would bet my bottom dollar Jessica Alba has never used this torturous device.</li>
    <li> the products is overall good but the charger is so loose, can some one let me know is this fault in my Epilator or its come like this...</li>
    <li> This equipment is better than the one that I bought before, but I don&#x27;t use it very often. The last one the batery dies but I bought it in a different place, I hope this item work better for me.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, black hair that grows with insane abundance on my legs and I quite literally need to shave every single day without fail or by the next morning my legs have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (so to speak).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My aunt, cousin and sister in-law had all been chattering in my ears about these Epilators. Didn&#x27;t sound so appealing to me honestly as I&#x27;m 5% curious and 95% chicken shit. Two of them had warned me how painful it was with the exception of my sister in-law who went above and beyond the call of duty with letting me know how painful epilating is when you first start. She shared with me her personal experience of having to have a few glasses of wine first which still didn&#x27;t help much as she wound up in tears and she was only able to do a few minutes 1 day with the epilator, then more the next day, etc...  Had me scratching my head wondering why the heck anyone would willingly self-torture with this machine if it was so darned bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I finally got tired of having to shave eeeevery single day and thought oh what the heck, why not? I felt the lump in my throat grow as I hit the \\&quot;place order button\\&quot; and I wasn&#x27;t even sure if I was wasting my money I seriously doubted I had to guts to use the device I think I more loved the \\&quot;idea\\&quot; of it and hearing that after months you actually have hairs that just don&#x27;t grow back anymore with the added bonus of not having to shave for weeks for the hairs that do grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I waited until the epilator to arrive I was my own worst enemy anxiously worrying about how badly it would hurt, re-running the horror stories of others through my head. The day came it arrived and I read the booklet first that came with it. It suggested a hot shower or bath first to open the pores and make the experience less painful for first time epilators. I had my uber hot shower, used the free wipes that came with it in the box (to clean any soaps and/or creams off your skin), held my breath and more or less yelled Geronimo!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the device on the lowest setting (there are only two settings - first setting misses hairs but is gentler while the second setting is max speed and gets them all but hurts like hell to a newbie). I chose my knee for the test area to determine if it&#x27;s a pain I can tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few hairs hurt like hell but I&#x27;m sure it was only mostly to my brain hyping it all up for so long. After a few minutes I guess the skin goes a little numb and it hurts less.  Some time later I decided I can&#x27;t tolerate this epilating on a slow speed as it takes longer because you have to go over the same patches over and over so I jacked up the speed and did both of my legs. It hurt like hell let me tell you. Virgin hairs being pulled out on the \\&quot;Efficiency\\&quot; speed wasn&#x27;t the smartest thing to do but it was better than dragging the experience out. The same thing that happened with my knee happened with my legs...after a while the legs go numb and the epilating is tolerable so I was thankful for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to keep epilating, it did not feel  great but at the same time it wasn&#x27;t too too bad either. I had some minor issues later that day however. For a few hours after epilating for the first time my pores were stinging and at night I could not put a blanket on my legs as the skin was sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you epilate for the first time be advised your skin will turn beet red and it will sting for quite a while after. Also, some hairs tend to get pulled out with a small trace of blood behind them for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a fair amount of research before buying this epialator and I am confident I made the right choice just based off the fact  it hurt less than everyone had informed me it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this particular epilator came with a variety of different head covers as well as a trimming head. It came with a really nice little bag, cleaning brush and a package of special epliating wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve got some weeks under my belt with this thing here is the good and the bad of it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not too painful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fast and efficient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 2 speeds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Built in light which really comes in handy for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- love the different types of heads it came with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Love that it seems to take less than 1 hour to charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Looks pleasing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Came with a surprise freebie of a package of special wipes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It does make sound but it&#x27;s not as loud as I would have expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Can be cleaned under a running tap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sucks I have to do this in the interest of saving time everyday in the shower but it&#x27;s a necessary evil. After using it a few weeks I&#x27;ve come to highly value the service this tool provides as I only need to epilate once in a blue moon and have even started doing my arms with the device too. I am glad I started doing this even if it does hurt a bit. I can&#x27;t say I recommend or don&#x27;t recommend this product as epilating isn&#x27;t for everyone. Depends on your pain threshold as well as your desire to try something like this but overall I myself and very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Once you have you have used an epilator a couple of times the hair grows back slower &amp; finer and it&#x27;s not painful anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I prefer to use this dry, but I LOVE being able to wash it with water when I&#x27;m done&lt;br /&gt;-The light helps you see what you&#x27;ve missed&lt;br /&gt;-Two heads: epilator &amp; clipper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The clipper attachment is flimsy and breaks easily</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing, and will leave your skin feeling silky smooth! Initially, it was painful, but honestly it gets better with more uses. My underarm skin has lightened ever since I started using this, and the hair is no longer dark and course. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I gifted it to my wife...she loved it a lot.she claims that its an awesome epilator she has ever used.Its an absolute value for money.</li>
    <li> Awesome....this is my best purchase till date....love it...battery 100 points....pain nill...jusr the perfect</li>
    <li> pretty awesome, price though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a lot of my friends had these and i tried theirs out and liked it so much so I got my own. :)&lt;br /&gt;I like how you can change the different heads on the epilator and that it comes with its cleaning brush and bag.</li>
    <li> So yes, I love it!  used it for the first time right before going interior camping for 10 days and I had nice soft silky legs for most of the trip! incredible since I usually have to bring a razor and try to shave ever other day or so. It&#x27;s windy and cold, I get goose bumps, cut myself...This was such a luxury!  Now mind you the first use hurt SO bad, I would deliver a baby before agreeing to experience that again, but then my hair is dark, course and dense. The worst combination lol  So five stars, cause really it&#x27;s not the epilators I have so much hair.  I now use it once to twice a week depending on my hair growth, and the pain is minimal. little pinchy sensation every now and then but for the most part the vibrating seems to mask the pain now.  The razor head is OK, I have not worked up the courage to try the face, arm pits or bikini area (yet) but I plan to get there. But I love my legs! I plan to keep it up and NEVER let it all grow out again! I have experienced some ingrown hairs so exfoliation is key. Otherwise I am very happy and plan to bring it with me hunting fully charged and ready to go.</li>
    <li> The best epilator, I&#x27;ve ever had. It picks up the smallest hair ever.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work. I followed the instructions exactly and continued to use this product for about two months. I read countless blogs about epilating and tips for making it work better. I found that while it was very painful the first time, it became less painful each time. I used this almost every day for the entire two months. During that period, my legs were NEVER smooth. Some reviewers claimed that their legs were smoother than every, but that was not the case for me. I longed for the smoothness of freshly shaved legs. I finally gave up and went back to shaving. I never minded shaving and I&#x27;m not prone to cuts and nicks, I was interested in the epilator because I thought it would be a weekly hair removal solution as opposed to having to shave three or four times per week. Instead I was epliating every day and still not achieving smooth legs. Shaving is a lot less painful and yet provides smoother results. I really don&#x27;t think this epilator is the problem, epliating just won&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: the shaver works well.</li>
    <li> This machine is amazing.  I use it for my entire body. I even use it for my mustache.  It is saving me lots of cash by not going to salon to get my legs, armpits, Brazilian and mustache waxed.  And yes you read correctly.  I do my full Brazilian with this machine.  First time took a long time and yes i was painful but now I am used to it and it lasts a long time.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> more hair rmoval less pain</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and the pain is not as bad as I expected. It gets every single hair--even the shorter, finer ones.</li>
    <li> So painful. It literally rips the hair out. Bikini area is already sensitive. I used it several times and followed directions. It never got easier.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job. Didn&#x27;t expect much more. Would like a better battery life.</li>
    <li> I liked this product Braun SE7681 Sil-epil 7. There were alot of reveiwers who said it was painful, it really isn&#x27;t bad. It just plucking times 10! Generally you are plucking more than one hair at a time with this rather than one at a time with a tweezers. I have not used it while wet, and really haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot. When I did though, the &#x27;pain&#x27; was what I thought it would be, kind of a quick sting, then it goes away immediately. Overall I like it, I am hoping I will use it more and more.</li>
    <li> I had an old braun epilator maybe from 1999 and was good only for the legs.  I bought this one and id  a great job initially for the shaving, but then the head stopped doing the same function than the first time.  The old model you could turn it of and leave it or cARRY IT WITH NO PROBLEMS, WITH THIS NEW MODEL I HAVE TO PUT A TAPE ON THE TURN OFF BUTTON SO IT DOES NOT TURN BY ITSELF.  iT BECAME STICKY DUE TO PUTTING TAPE.  SOMETIMES IT HURT ME WHEN IT WAS RUNNING OUT OF BATTERY AND SOMETIMES WORK JUST REALLY WELL.  i &#x27;M NOT SURE WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE.  wHAT  i REALLY HATED WAS THAT IT MADE ME GREW HAIR THAT I HAD REMOVED PREVIOUSLY AND DID NOT GROW MORE.  tHAT REALLY UPSET ME.  fOR THE LEGS IS OK AND WORKS GOOD.  FOR THE BIKINI WAS TERRIBLE.  IN A WAY i PREFER THE OLDER MODEL.  THE LIGHT IS NOT HELPFUL ALL THE TIME, SOMETIMES IT&#x27;S BETTER DAILY LIGHT.  HOWEVER, THE IDEA IS COOL.</li>
    <li> i liked it. works very well. thanks for quick delivery</li>
    <li> Kind of satisfied... For the price I paid, I honestly expected more.</li>
    <li> i love it!! takes some practice if your new to this. but better than a scary razor that can cut you. It did kind of bite my skin when it ran out of power. so keep the time in mind when you use it. make sure to fully charge it before you use it. only 4 stars because the tweezer head broke when i dropped it without the cap. so be careful.</li>
    <li> This product rips the hairs out by the roots, much like a tweezers, but many hairs at once. It is very effective and after using it for a while, the hairs will start to grow in thinner and weaker. But if you have a low pain tolerance, or have a medical condition that makes you sensitive (Fibromyalgia, Nueropathy etc) then I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Very durable machine. I have owned it for a while now. I use it all the time!</li>
    <li> This machine is awesome. Yes, there is some pain but we are women! Pain is part of the deal. But the reward is longer periods between sessions and smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Although painful, an epilator saved me the time and money I would have to invest on waxing. I had previously used another product for just my legs. Reading the other amazon reviews for Braun, I decided to go with the more expensive version of Braun. And I am happy! The first few minutes are painful, and then I got used to it. It works in the shower, which is even better because I don&#x27;t have anymore the problem with ingrown hair as with the previous product (but I also followed the advice of others to exfoliate every few days). The battery life has been great so far. It is also easy to clean and put away.</li>
    <li> Works great. Takes a couple of tries on thicket stubborn hair, but leaves silky smooth skin for days!!!</li>
    <li> Been using it about 2 months now. I&#x27;m female in my 30&#x27;s and have some hormone related facial stubbles (upper lip, under chin/neck). I&#x27;ve done laser and electrolysis but what seems to be never ending and expensive I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot. And actually works really well so far! The thing is you have to wait for the different hair cycles to go through and you&#x27;ll see less and less hair. Of course this isn&#x27;t permanent but I use this once a week now and my face is super smooth once again! I have not noticed any ingrowns except for one hair, but with my fair sensitive skin I get that even without epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain is very tolerable, no worse than laser and definitely not as bad as electrolysis. I use the fastest setting and with the leg adapter because it gets a slightly wider area than the facial one (but I started going by the directions first). I also exfoliate once or twice a week also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the great things is it only seems to get rid of the more coarse hair and leaves the fine wispy hairs untouched which makes things feel more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what the long term effects of use but so far I have no complaints in the 2 months. Glad I took a chance after reading so many warnings and negative articles about epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also tested on my legs a smaller area. Surprisingly I got much redder, which went away after 2 days. Didn&#x27;t do the whole thing but results were good and no ingrowns. Pain was a little more intense because of a bigger area. But again, pain is nothing compared to laser or electro.</li>
    <li> I purchased the epilator just to upgrade from the 5 series I already owned. I loved the fact it is wet to dry, and that was the main reason I wanted it. Although it&#x27;s cuter, a bit more modern and sleek; I didnt like it. It didnt catch all of the hair.  It is not worth the price. However; I give it 2 stars because the hair it did catch was almost painless. It missed a lot of hair and the attachments were kind of blah and unnecessary. Needless to say, I went back to using my ancient epilator.</li>
    <li> So far good no issues. I will update after using many more times. Seems like it is overpriced. Not idea how it is compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this on a regular basis. Her legs are nice and smooth at all times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it on my face but it works pretty well; definitely quicker and easier than hand-tweezing.</li>
    <li> its the best cause you get to use it all over your body. i like the facial part. make sure you don&#x27;t spend too much time on your face otherwise you wont like the result. the only downside is that it could turn off any minute and you wont be able to use it until after an hour from charging it. happened to me last night while i was in the middle of my leg. and you cant use it while its charging. i hope they make a similar model fixing this problem.</li>
    <li> Quick &amp; easy to use and easy to clean. This has made life much easier.  I can use this epilator once every 2-3 weeks immediately after shower and don&#x27;t have to worry about taking hours out on a weekend for waxing.</li>
    <li> really good realyyy y yy y y yyy yy yyy yyy yyy yy yyyy yy yy yyyy yy yy gooooooooooood</li>
    <li> Kind off hurts. I use it on my underarms. Shaving is quicker for legs and I usually don&#x27;t have time to labor over the legs.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Removes all your hair at your speed.  Absolutely love it</li>
    <li> This epilator comes the closest in the US to the best in Europe.  It is a quality product.  Both wet and dry settings work well.  I am very pleased with this product and would buy from Braun again.</li>
    <li> Caused a serious rash</li>
    <li> I started using this product on my legs about six months ago. Each use hurt and after a while I stopped using it because I wasn&#x27;t sure if the pain was worth the effort. After two or three months, however, I noticed that I only had to shave my legs once a week because my hair regrowth was really slow and a lot sparser than normal. I used to have to shave everyday for smooth legs because I have such thick, coarse hair, so this was great. I think the pattern of regrowth is due to having used the Braun for a few months, so I decided to get it back out and continue using it every once in a while because the much slower and lighter regrowth of hair is definitely worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product. I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because it hurts to use, but it does get better as you get used to the process.</li>
    <li> It is my second epilator from Braun and I think it is so much better than any other method you might think off. My first one does not work here in the States because of Voltage.</li>
    <li> It works really well. Removes hair without discomfort and lasts for about 3 days which is good. Good price also.</li>
    <li> My friend let me try her Braun, and I fell in love with it. I can forget about shaving my legs now! What a relief! In the summer time, it&#x27;s like a blessing. It is a little painful when you first use the epilator, but it&#x27;s tolerable and will not be painful when you use it again for maintenance. I would advise against using it on your underarms and please be very careful with the bikini zone! It takes some patience and a well-lit bathroom, but it&#x27;s worth it. I do not get any ingrown hairs any more either. What an excellent invention!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this product as my legs will never be smooth, hair free as I was hoping, there is always stubble due to the different rate of new hair growth and the fact that the tweezers DO NOT remove new short hair growth. Description indicates it will pick up tiny hairs as small as a grain of sand, this sadly is not fact. Yes, it is true the hair that grows in is much thinner, therefore the stubble is not awful as in the past.  I hope with newer technology, Braun will eventually come out with a model that will actually mreove new short hair growth. I will continue to use the product, however in the summer I will still have to shave my legs to get a close shave and have  smooth legs hair free.  As far as the pain, it was uncomfortable the first time on my legs, but after that, you do get used to it. It just tingles on my arms, then itches a bit .  I am however too scared at this time to use it on the bikini line but I will get there at some point.</li>
