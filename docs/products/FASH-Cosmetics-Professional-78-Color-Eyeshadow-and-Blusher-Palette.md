      <li>This was the first time I have EVER purchased anything from the internet and I am very satisfied!!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>But the blushes are beautiful and the set was cheap.</li>
      <li>But theres a lot of them, the mirror is really nice, and i like the blushes on the bottom, some of the eye shadows fall out.</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>Excellent eyeshadows, really pigmented.</li>
      <li>the quality of the actual powder is great!</li>
      <li>There are so many colors to choose from I</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my sister and I would say its just okay.</li>
      <li>but it would be better with lip gloss in it.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve had it longer, more pots have come unglued.</li>
      <li>but I am a satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>to make my colors more intensed</li>
      <li>At first I didnt think that the shadow was going to be any good.</li>
      <li>this is some good eyeshadow  very colorful and vibrant</li>
      <li>I tone down the very bright ones by mixing them on my brush with more muted colors.</li>
      <li>but I thought for $12 and free 2 day shipping...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth</li>
      <li>For the price I was expecting some cheap knockoff product, but SO not the case.</li>
      <li>This is an affordable way of getting some unique colors without spending a lot of money for them.  </li>
      <li>Giving it 2 stars because the color choice was good only if I could use it.</li>
      <li>but it is good if you want to experiment with different looks.</li>
      <li>I love how it was package &amp; how fast the delivery was.</li>
      <li>after I received it I realized it was Absolutely Amazing!So many</li>
      <li>i bought 2 of these for each of my sisters, i wasn&#x27;t very happy when i received it, it looked like i bought a sample product of how small it was!</li>
      <li>Very nice for the price - good eyeshadow in different colors - the light ones are a little chalky and don&#x27;t show up</li>
      <li>I love my new eyeshadow pallet and makeup brushes!</li>
      <li>Everything was in order, it got here quick, and nothing was damaged.</li>
      <li>The pallette arrived quickly to my home.  </li>
      <li>I was very excited about receiving my new eyeshadow palette.</li>
      <li>Overall, the price was amazing for the number of colors.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m enjoying mine so far.</li>
      <li>but if you wet brush it come out good and one of mine was broke</li>
      <li>The browns are really pretty</li>
      <li>Really pretty -- couldn&#x27;t wait to dive in.  </li>
      <li>The eyeshadow was packed very well and arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>When I opened the box, one of the eyeshadows fell out on the floor and I almost returned the product, however; upon testing a couple of the shades, I found that they were of high quality and nicely pigmented, so I decided the quality of the product itself outweighed the minor packaging defect and decided to keep it.</li>
      <li>The colors are very vibrant in person and they go on well with an eye shadow primer.  </li>
      <li>But there easily put back in</li>
      <li>I have light ivory skin and the green is a little too bold for my fair skin.</li>
      <li>I wish they would have packed it more carefully.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I bought this pallet on the cheap because I&#x27;m just starting to experiment with make-up and colors.</li>
      <li>or I&#x27;ll use them wet for greater intensity.</li>
      <li>I was very hesitant to purchase this palette...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even need a primer it works very well for me</li>
      <li>There are about 20 colors that I really like...</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant and they were all in place.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not dissatisfied with this product, and I think it&#x27;s a decent start for anyone that&#x27;s like me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to rave over the quality of the makeup because it&#x27;s quite ordinary, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned this is a great deal - if you don&#x27;t think so try to construct the same type of set buying separate items for under twelve dollars.</li>
      <li>I liked this pallette because it has some of the darker colors at the bottom (a near black) that you do not see with some of the other pallettes that are available.  </li>
      <li>but none were broken so that was good.  </li>
      <li>And I needed some new shadows to build my collection.</li>
      <li>thanks, item arrived on time, none of the shadow were broken, nice variety of color...have not use it</li>
      <li>It is exactly the same shows in the picture and it is inexpensive.</li>
      <li>My only suggestion would be to glue the inserts a little better and test them for looseness before shipment.    </li>
      <li>The colors don&#x27;t seem that pigmented and one of the blushes was completely destroyed on arrival.  </li>
      <li>if you have any eyeshadow primer to used with these color then it will stay on pretty well.. wear it alone, the colors dnt seem to stay on for long...</li>
      <li>the complement alone is too much so am going for another one for my big sis</li>
      <li>The only comment I can make other than that is that we were a bit surprised when we opened the huge box it was shipped in.</li>
      <li>The individual colors are about dime sized so don&#x27;t be surprised when you see it.  </li>
      <li>When I first opened it I noticed some of the little pots were gone, but upon closer inspection I saw that they had just come unglued and were moved around.</li>
      <li>When I received my palette, the mirror was broken off but that wasn&#x27;t a huge deal for the price I got it for.  </li>

<li> The entire pack is way bigger than I thought it was going to be, like the size of a large tablet, so I was surprised, but this is some serious shadow</li>
<li> not sure if they really are, but who cares.  </li>
<li> this shadows are picky with the primer (you need a thicker and not very creamy one).</li>
<li> Delivery time was as expected.</li>
<li> is not really pigmented need to apply like 5 time to get color</li>
<li> I use the big round ones as blush --</li>
<li> Not sure as to why there would be a red eyeshadow...</li>
<li> You end up with black shadow on your cheeks.</li>
<li> It came tightly wrapped with ALL the eye shadows intact!</li>
<li> Just they are REALLY SMALL.</li>
<li> the others, especially the black are disappointing.</li>
<li> few colors were totally broken and spilled over the other colors as well making them useless as well.</li>
<li> Not cute!</li>
<li> Colors are quite pigmented, but having the blush colors close to the black makes it difficult to use.</li>
<li> but it came poorly packaged and some of it was broken.</li>
<li> But unfortunately it arrived damaged.</li>
<li> Would not order again sadly.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy something expensive in case</li>
<li> I was a bit disappointed with the product.</li>

<li> Very disappointed in the shipping.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The colors don&#x27;t seem that pigmented and one of the blushes was completely destroyed on arrival.  Still, I&#x27;m just learning and for the price, I think this can be a great buy.</li>
    <li> I love it best thing I could need but it would be better with lip gloss in it.</li>
    <li> this is some good eyeshadow  very colorful and vibrant i would recomend this product again</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow was packed very well and arrived right on time. I was expecting each color to be slightly bigger, but I am not at all dissappointed.</li>
    <li> I love how it was package &amp; how fast the delivery was. if you have any eyeshadow primer to used with these color then it will stay on pretty well.. wear it alone, the colors dnt seem to stay on for long...</li>
    <li> Excellent eyeshadows, really pigmented. Just they are REALLY SMALL. But theres a lot of them, the mirror is really nice, and i like the blushes on the bottom, some of the eye shadows fall out. But there easily put back in</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price - good eyeshadow in different colors - the light ones are a little chalky and don&#x27;t show up - you also get three blushes and three bronzers. I&#x27;m not going to rave over the quality of the makeup because it&#x27;s quite ordinary, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned this is a great deal - if you don&#x27;t think so try to construct the same type of set buying separate items for under twelve dollars.</li>
    <li> thanks, item arrived on time, none of the shadow were broken, nice variety of color...have not use it so don&#x27;t know how the color stay...</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to purchase this palette...but I thought for $12 and free 2 day shipping...what&#x27;s there to lose? And I needed some new shadows to build my collection. With that said, I&#x27;d recommend this for beginners that want to add to their makeup collection. However, this should not be your only palette. There are about 20 colors that I really like...the others, especially the black are disappointing. Some are not pigmented...period!! Its like picking up translucent powder...nothing comes up haha I can&#x27;t even make swatches to show you guys! But I won&#x27;t be re purchasing. I&#x27;ll use them tho maybe with a great primer or I&#x27;ll use them wet for greater intensity.</li>
    <li> The pallette arrived quickly to my home.  I gave the product four stars because upon opening the box, some of the individual colors had come out of their designated spaces in transit and I had to put it back together- but none were broken so that was good.  The colors are very vibrant in person and they go on well with an eye shadow primer.  I liked this pallette because it has some of the darker colors at the bottom (a near black) that you do not see with some of the other pallettes that are available.  The individual colors are about dime sized so don&#x27;t be surprised when you see it.  Overall, the price was amazing for the number of colors.  This is an affordable way of getting some unique colors without spending a lot of money for them.  I&#x27;m enjoying mine so far.</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed with the product. It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth like I wanted it to be. I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Received this with in the week I ordered it. For the price I was expecting some cheap knockoff product, but SO not the case. It came tightly wrapped with ALL the eye shadows intact! The quality is actually BETTER than the drug store brand makeup which is over priced and doesn&#x27;t work that great. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this pallet on the cheap because I&#x27;m just starting to experiment with make-up and colors. I didn&#x27;t want to buy something expensive in case I hated it. When I first opened it I noticed some of the little pots were gone, but upon closer inspection I saw that they had just come unglued and were moved around. Since I&#x27;ve had it longer, more pots have come unglued. I&#x27;m not dissatisfied with this product, and I think it&#x27;s a decent start for anyone that&#x27;s like me. I&#x27;m just excited to know what colors work best with my face and eyes.</li>
    <li> Really pretty -- couldn&#x27;t wait to dive in.  Planned to give 2 as gifts, but one arrived with a smashed color.  I use the big round ones as blush -- not sure if they really are, but who cares.  The colors last all day.  I tone down the very bright ones by mixing them on my brush with more muted colors.</li>
    <li> Not a lot of information before I purchased this, but after I received it I realized it was Absolutely Amazing!So many colors!And the quality of the actual powder is great! Has shimmery undertones too!</li>
    <li> When I received my palette, the mirror was broken off but that wasn&#x27;t a huge deal for the price I got it for.  I glued it back on and I absolutely love all of the colors :) It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> I was very excited about receiving my new eyeshadow palette. The colors are vibrant and they were all in place. to make my colors more intensed I use an eyeshadow primer which helps. I would recommend this product, even though I was skepitcal because of the low price but I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> My daughter is using it, she loves it.  The only comment I can make other than that is that we were a bit surprised when we opened the huge box it was shipped in. We thought it would be larger from the images we&#x27;d seen of it.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It is exactly the same shows in the picture and it is inexpensive. Anyway, I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 12-year-old daughter. Delivery time was as expected. When I opened the box, one of the eyeshadows fell out on the floor and I almost returned the product, however; upon testing a couple of the shades, I found that they were of high quality and nicely pigmented, so I decided the quality of the product itself outweighed the minor packaging defect and decided to keep it. I know my daughter will love it! My only suggestion would be to glue the inserts a little better and test them for looseness before shipment.    Thank YOU,  Heather</li>
    <li> This item it&#x27;s really good when ever i use it the complement alone is too much so am going for another one for my big sis</li>
    <li> The browns are really pretty and so are the purples. This product would be great for a medium skin tone. I have light ivory skin and the green is a little too bold for my fair skin. Not sure as to why there would be a red eyeshadow...but it is good if you want to experiment with different looks. And the color lasts all day.</li>
    <li> granddaughter loves it</li>
    <li> I love the make uo eye shadow it blends perfectly I don&#x27;t even need a primer it works very well for me</li>
    <li> is not really pigmented need to apply like 5 time to get color</li>
    <li> i love those strong happy colors, really happy with the blushes and the way the pallete has the colors organized. this shadows are picky with the primer (you need a thicker and not very creamy one).</li>
    <li> I love my new eyeshadow pallet and makeup brushes! This was the first time I have EVER purchased anything from the internet and I am very satisfied!! Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> At first I didnt think that the shadow was going to be any good. But the color is deep when you put it on. There are so many colors to choose from I almost feel overwhelmed looking at it. The entire pack is way bigger than I thought it was going to be, like the size of a large tablet, so I was surprised, but this is some serious shadow and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order from this seller again. Everything was in order, it got here quick, and nothing was damaged. Nice.</li>
    <li> These are really great palettes for someone on a budget! Colors are quite pigmented, but having the blush colors close to the black makes it difficult to use. You end up with black shadow on your cheeks. Not cute!</li>
    <li> I purchased this palette thinking of the great variety of colors it has. But unfortunately it arrived damaged. few colors were totally broken and spilled over the other colors as well making them useless as well. Very disappointed in the shipping. I wish they would have packed it more carefully. They just lost a customer. Giving it 2 stars because the color choice was good only if I could use it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister and I would say its just okay. She is younger so it will work for her but it came poorly packaged and some of it was broken. Would not order again sadly.</li>
    <li> i bought 2 of these for each of my sisters, i wasn&#x27;t very happy when i received it, it looked like i bought a sample product of how small it was! i did give it a 3 star for the different colors to choose from, and from the shipping nothing got broke!</li>
    <li> product not cream like I thought chalky but if you wet brush it come out good and one of mine was broke</li>
    <li> The color payoff is not the best, in my opinion. But the blushes are beautiful and the set was cheap. You get what you pay for.</li>
