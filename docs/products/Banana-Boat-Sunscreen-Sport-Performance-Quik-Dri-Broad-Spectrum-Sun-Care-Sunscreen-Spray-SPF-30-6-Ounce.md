      <li>I am sure it&#x27;s a good product but not</li>

      <li>The paste is probably more effective though.</li>

      <li>I especially love this product for my one year old.  </li>

      <li>I just wish they made a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I hope it gets stocked more often.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s as if the lords of the sunblock left us with the perfect block, and then decided to hide it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite no touch sun screen. It works great and smells delicious. I just wish they made a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; version.</li>
    <li> Leaked out about 1/3 of the liquid into the packing material.</li>
    <li> I have use this on multiple Habitat for Humanity trips and have never been burned.  I apply it in the morning and again at lunch and it has worked great.  My son and I are both very light skinned and burn easily.  He has used it in New Mexico being outside most of the day and it has worked better than any other sun screen we have tried.</li>
    <li> on my parted hair , so that I do not get a sunburned scalp., this is what I use it for.</li>
    <li> Being a hairy guy, it&#x27;s a lot of effort to spread a cream over my legs and arms (and it&#x27;s futile to attempt my chest). However, this spray comes out as a fine mist that gets past my hairs to the skin. So, a spray and quick rub is all it takes. I still use a cream on my face because the alcohol base can sting (particularly after shaving).    Effectiveness: I&#x27;m a pale white northerner living in Miami. This stuff works.  Value: I find that a bottle last much longer than the aerosol sprays.  On-Skin Feeling: significantly less sticky/greasy than creams  Downside: when the bottle starts to get empty, it has to be upright to spray (which makes doing your own legs more challenging).    Living in Miami I have to sunblock year round and have tried lots of different sunscreen products. This has been my fave for the last four years.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff because my husband learned it works as a repellent for gnats in addition to sunscreen.  It works wonders keeping the gnats away - a quick spray in the face and several in the hair keeps them away for hours.  As a sunscreen it works fairly well but keep in mind it is not waterproof.  It is light and not oily so fine to use on the face and hair.  Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I don&#x27;t use it on the face, because it does not seem strong enough for my nose (very fair skinned).  But for the rest of the body, it applies very quickly and works very well, especially if you have hairy arms, chest, etc.  Seems to last much, much longer than the aerosol cans.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in the stores.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon still has it.  Get it while you can.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the way this stuff smells. That is the only reason I buy it. It works just fine as a sunscreen too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good solution for preventing sunburn on the scalp without wearing a hat.  I use a lot of sunscreen and this isn&#x27;t the best one I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s somewhat effective and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair super greasy like regular sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen.  It goes on clear (doesn&#x27;t stain clothes) and is dry to the touch, not greasy or oily like other products.  Works great on scalp too without making hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and I for when we ride~ Awesome and fits in Bike well.  Will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> So, finally received this item and it was only 1/2 full.  It was covered in oil, and smelled terrible, like it had gone bad.  Honestly, it was going to cost more to send it back than just get rid of it.  Overall, uber bad.  h.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t even used it yet, but upset the package came and the contents of the bottle had spilled out, stained the box, and made the bottles sticky.  Really?</li>
    <li> Thank you so much to Amazon for carrying this pump spray clear sunscreen.  My husband works outdoors and this is what he likes the best. We can&#x27;t find it in any of the stores around us anymore. I always check Amazon.com for items and once again they have what I&#x27;m looking for at a great price.</li>
    <li> It leaked in the mail and then continued to leak in my beach bag while we were on vacation.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my scalp-if you have no hair it would work great but I have hair and it was a sticky greasy mess. Yuck!!</li>
    <li> got this for my toe-headed thin-haired 1 year old. easy to apply and i feel better letting him out in the sun, especially since he always rips off his hat.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product yet - beach vacation starts next week.  Only received 2/3 of a bottle due to poor packaging.  The bottle was loose in the bottom of the box and leaked all over.</li>
    <li> My favorite overall sunscreen. Light scent and easy to apply. I even use on my scalp! Not greasy or sticky. Makes my skin soft. Very hard to find in stores in my area so I always buy extra. Easier application than aerosol!</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere for this product.  We have used it for several years and highly recommend it to our friends.  We used to be able to pick it up at Target, but I couldn&#x27;t find it there this year.  I especially love this product for my one year old.  She has very fine short hair.</li>
    <li> This contains a lot of alcohol supposedly to make it dry quickly but it also makes it get used up very quickly. The scent is also quite strong.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> I am sure it&#x27;s a good product but not what l thought l ordered</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, and just what I wanted at at a fair price.</li>
    <li> First of all, manufacturers are horrible for not having the liquid spray and going solely towards aerosol spray.  Aerosol spray lasts one day.  This liquid spray dries quickly and lasts several days longer than the aerosol.    This spray liquid is a must unless you want to spend a fortune on aerosol.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as well as [[ASIN:B001PLKJLS Bull Frog Sunblock, Surfer Formula Gel, SPF 36 5 fl oz (147 ml)]]. Besides a better price point, I&#x27;ve found this product wanting in comparison. With the mist spray, I feel like it&#x27;s much harder to get even coverage than with the gel. The texture isn&#x27;t just as nice either, and despite actually using both with the same frequency, I&#x27;ve found that I need to use much more of this to feel like I get even coverage. I&#x27;d highly recommend the Bull Frog Sunblock instead.</li>
    <li> I will only order my sunscreen this way again. If you have a pool and a lot of people always looking for the sunscreen, having 3 bottles around is great and the prices was a bargin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really quick drying at all. Perhaps it&#x27;s because we are usually using it in tropical, humid conditions, but that stuff feels sticky and stays sticky for a while. I will say that I haven&#x27;t burned while using this. And it&#x27;s easy to spray on and spread the stuff around on your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunblock floor years, and even with the fairly low SPF, it works very well. The only thing is be careful with its making sure you run the sunblock in after you spray it - it can be very easy to miss patches, and end up with circles of skin that are protected with unprotected spaces in between, but if you put in a minimal effort to rub the sunblock in (which honestly you should be doing anyway with ALL sunblock), it works like a charm. This sunblock is MUCH less greasy than your standard cream sunblocks, and it doesn&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;tacky/gummy feeling&amp;#34; that so many sunblocks do.</li>
    <li> This is spritzer of alcohol-based sunscreen.  I like the spritzer for applying the sunscreen fast - I find it faster than aerosol.  The sunscreen is in alcohol, so it isn&#x27;t oily.  I can put in on and not need to wash my hands before I do something.  And it&#x27;s sport sunscreen, so it&#x27;s okay to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it when I went sailing and loved it.  I now keep a bottle in my convertible.  For what I need, it&#x27;s far better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> This spray is not greasy and is very easy to apply.  A quick application makes it easier for reapplication and keeps me from getting burned.</li>
    <li> great product especially for the hair-non greasy and protects color treated hair- a real plus.-helps it not too fade too quickly</li>
    <li> I used this to spray on my chillds hair for all day swimming at a water park.. I have to say it did work because there was no sunburn to the scalp at all. Getting it out of the hair was  an entire/ different ordeal. It made the hair like glued straw and it did not wash out all the way until a couple of hair washes. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Kids been wanting spray sunblock, but the aerosol cans seem so wasteful.  This pump jar does the trick. The paste is probably more effective though.</li>
    <li> AMAZON HAS BEST PRICING, GREAT SHIPPING, THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR THE SCALP IF IN THE SUN.  Only downside is it makes hair very sticky</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and seems to last longer than the other spray types.  It does sting a little going on faces and sensitive skin, which makes it not so great for small kids.</li>
    <li> I like alcohol based gel sunscreen but can not find it anymore.  This spray on sunscreen works similarly.  I spray it on and rub with my hand to ensure even coverage.  BEWARE!  In hot weather the bottle may leak.  It leaked and destroyed a book that was packed with it.  The packaging was poor so be careful what you order with it.</li>
    <li> Good spf in a non aerosol formiula. quick shipping! Spray on head and around face for excellent protection.  No aerosol fumes to ignite you when you start your grill or (God forbid) smoke</li>
    <li> I use this to spray in my girls hair to keep their parts from burring in the sun. Its drys quickly and does not look greasy like other spray sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years to protect my skin from the sun. It&#x27;s quick &amp; easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed that many brick and mortar stores have stopped carrying it for some reason. Hope its not being discontinued because I don&#x27;t know what else I would use.</li>
    <li> This product is awful. After using it last weekend, my husband ended up having splotchy burns all over his chest.  I thought it was odd, and figured maybe he didn&#x27;t apply it evenly.  Today we went to the beach and we went out of our way to make sure we were applying it liberally and evenly.  Came home this evening and we are covered in splotchy burns.  Its like half the bottle is just water or something. This is just dangerous, we used sunscreen to avoid burns and cancer, and instead we&#x27;re covered, we might as well have used a spray bottle of tap water.</li>
    <li> For those men with very short hair cuts and those who need sun protection on their head because of balding, this is a great product. Not greasy and does the job in a flash before you head out into the sun, especially if you are riding around with the sunroof open during these nice weather days! Not a bottle to pack in your luggage, as the top doesn&#x27;t seal well. It&#x27;s best to buy a small carry/travel spray bottle and fill it.</li>
    <li> I believe it is comfortable and is suitable for me. I love it and recommend it for it. The shipping is not slow.</li>
    <li> Works perfect! Have yet to get a sunburn or even a tan (i like to be pale). Easy to apply, except for the legs since you kind of have to turn the bottle upside down.</li>
    <li> My husband has blond thin hair, this is a summer necessity for him.  Yes, he can wear a hat but he needs to take it off at times and this helps ensure that he doesn&#x27;t end up with a sunburned bean.  It can be used as a body sunscreen also but we save this for his head and my part since we have had a hard time finding this in the past few years.  I was excited to find it on Amazon.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I cannot easily find this item in a store near me, so I bought at Amazon.  I like using this pump sunscreen for the scalp and ears.  Continuous spray or lotion sunscreens don&#x27;t work well at all for those areas.</li>
    <li> Thirteen years ago, I shaved my head. And I learned a very painful lesson - your scalp can burn. Now, while I don&#x27;t keep my head shaved for longer then two or three weeks at a time, I keep my hair short year round. Short enough that I can still burn up there on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, I burn at the drop of a hat. People often laugh at me when I put on my third or fourth coat of sun screen in the same day. But if I don&#x27;t, I will regret it, guaranteed. So naturally, I needed to find something I could use to protect my scalp even when I had some hair up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While searching through the store one day, I happened upon this sunscreen. It&#x27;s purely liquid. In fact, the bottle is clear, so you can see all the way through it. You apply the sunscreen by using one of those old fashioned finger pumps like on a spray bottle to spray the liquid onto your skin. Since the liquid including some rubbing alcohol, it dries rather quickly. The sunscreen has a pleasant, mild odor, but nothing overpowering. It&#x27;s not the coconut smell you normally associate with sunscreen. But all you need to do is spray and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite using this fairly faithfully, I have still gotten my share of sun burns over the last few years. Being rather slow, it took me a while to discover the secrets of avoiding them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I was used to the old smear on sunscreens where you personally make sure you cover every inch you don&#x27;t want burned. The bottle claims you don&#x27;t need to rub it in, just spray and go. As a result of believing them (and my own carelessness), I got some funny sun burns where I had patches of light and patches of burn. See, the spray only hits parts of your body. You either need to make sure you spray every square inch or rub what you do spray around. I have found that by spraying and rubbing, I actually do cover everything and don&#x27;t get those funny burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, you also want to do this when covering your face. As with most things, you don&#x27;t want to get this in your eyes. I&#x27;ve found spraying it on my hands and then rubbing my face is the best way to make sure I cover everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to spray this on 15 minutes before sun exposure. Unlike the myth about swimming 30 minutes after eating, take this one seriously. When I apply it before I leave the house, giving it time to dry and my skin time to absorb it, I find I run a better chance of avoiding that burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the front, the bottle says that it is ultra sweat proof and waterproof. On the back, it says to reapply after swimming or toweling off. So which do you believe? The back, of course. Frankly, I have never met a sunscreen that was truly waterproof, which is one of the reasons I reapply so often. I&#x27;ve found with a great coat applied before I leave home (long enough before hand to be absorbed), I can reapply later on the fly and avoid sun burn. Of course, if I can stay in the shade for a while after doing so, all the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The six once bottle is a little more expensive then most of the sun blocks you find on the market. But I feel it is worth it to keep my hair short but my scalp burn free. With an SPF 30 rating, this is right in the middle of the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per usual, I got a couple of burns this summer. One, I forgot to put anything on. (Who can I blame for that?) The other I wasn&#x27;t careful with how I applied the sunscreen, and got the uneven sunburn to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all sunscreen, you need to follow instructions and apply it carefully. But if you do, this one should keep you burn free in the brightest conditions.ace. As with most things, you don&#x27;t want to get this in your eyes.

    <li> Something to do with the solvent effect in it gave me a headache.  I use the Loreal one with UV shield, or a grocery store mixture of coconut milk and aloe vera gel, or stuff like that.  Best to wear a hat and dip your head in the lake.</li>
    <li> Worked great this summer, especially on the scalp.  A little prevented my daughters head from burning in the part line.</li>
    <li> The description on Amazon says &amp;#34;unscented formula&amp;#34; which was one reason for me to try it. This product is definitely NOT unscented! It has a strong aftershave smell and even says on the bottle that fragrance is included. At least it seems to be &amp;#34;non greasy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great for scalp...bought this as a scalp protectant and it works great. It dries quickly but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair &#x27;crunchy&amp;#34; or significantly greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the best scalp sunscreen that won&#x27;t &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; up your hair.  I put this on my part.  A few of the men we boat with love it for their receding hair or bald spot.  You don&#x27;t always have to wear a hat.</li>
    <li> I used this sunscreen for a trip to the bahamas. I applied as the directions suggested every hour and after I got out of of water and WOW I got horribly sunburnt all over! I would not trust this product. I used another sunscreen for the rest of my trip and had no other skin issues.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunblock that I will buy.  I like that it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t make a mess in my arm/leg hair.  For my face, I spray the sunblock into my hands and apply like any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this manual pump over the more common pressurized spray bottles.  With this pump bottle, you can clearly see how much sunblock is remaining.  When a bottle has just a little left, I unscrew the lid and pour the remaining fluid into another bottle that isn&#x27;t empty yet.  Very little is wasted.  It is a great design and I am always suprised that there aren&#x27;t more products using this type of bottle.</li>
    <li> One had completely leaked out and appears whole package was exposed to extreme heat.</li>
    <li> Bought this sunscreen specifically to protect my scalp(thinning hair) from sunburn. Leaking container on delivery, strong unpleasant odor, and it also gummed up what hair it came in contact with. This is probably fine for non facial areas, but really gives a sticky feel to what hair I have left. I found an alternate product which is think is great especially for people who need scalp protection without sticky hair, called Sunsplash Scalp screen. They were out of product for a while but now seem to be back. I have no connection with them, just happened to come across them by accident years ago and am really happy with how well it works for my scalp. It soaks in fast, is very thin and leaves very little residue. Works on other areas just fine but a little expensive for full body protection. The other issue with Sunsplash is it is not easy to find, you have to go to the website and the shipping is pretty expensive if you only get one bottle. I get 3-4 for one shipping charge and give to friends.&lt;br /&gt;I sure wish that Amazon would stock this great product and make the shipping cheaper. I am not looking to trash the banana boat stuff, but just to let interested people know that there is an excellent product specifically for scalp protection that wont gum up you hair.</li>
    <li> I got this quick dry spray sunscreen, because it was required for my child&#x27;s swimming lessons in a private pool.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, and not greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t come off in the water, so it works great for pool play!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the continuous spray. Yes, while one hasty pump, it is easier to contain and control the spray. I was also pleasantly surprised that there is no overpowering scent. I will continue to purchase this one!</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen.  I spray it on my kids and have never had anyone burn.  I use it on myself and I never burn.  Dries quickly and lasts longer than the aerosol sunscreen sprays.</li>
    <li> This spray is great for scalp and body. Easy to hold/use. Only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that it can be hard to wash off. Almost leaves a film. But perhaps that speaks to it&#x27;s effectiveness. Appreciate that there is no lingering sunscreen odor.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful. It must have a lot of alcohol in it because it smells like vodka. For a good scalp screen, I recommend Nioxin.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair very short so this stuff is a Godsend in the summer for my head/neck.  I like the fact that it is more of a liquid then most other lotions (makes spraying it on easier and less greasy).  Even after a full day of swimming/sweating the stuff still works.  No chance of getting a burn once you spray this on!</li>
    <li> This is Banana Boat Quik Dry not Body and Scalp as shown in the picture.  If you are looking for scalp sunscreen look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Really good product for people with short hair, buzzcuts, balding heads. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky once it dries. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Got this to spray on real quick before I leave the house, considering I live in SoCal and am getting some strong sun on a daily basis. Dries fast and isn&#x27;t oily, but it does smell kind of like bug spray. The smell isn&#x27;t terrible, but it is noticeable and doesn&#x27;t really fade. That&#x27;s why 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I put it on 1 time in am and do not reapply after swimming and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> quick with good protection just reapply often which isnt too much trouble at all 4 stars because for the price you just dont get enough product</li>
    <li> This is great for thinning hair or any one not wanting a thick coating on them. stays on in water better than most sprays. I use it on my face also..</li>
    <li> This spray-on sunscreen is easy to use and effective.  It even works on your scalp.  It dries to a barely-noticeable sheen and won&#x27;t catch on fire around the campfire like aerosols. I&#x27;ve been using it happily for years.</li>
    <li> We used this as directed (repeatedly applied it throughout the day) for a day outing and we all ended up burnt to a crisp that evening.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was expired or just a crappy product.</li>
    <li> I use this product in my hair. It has the same effect as Bed Head hair mouse but at a fraction of the cost. approx 3 sparays is all I need and it lasts all day with no flakes or dandruff. Even better it keeps my head from burning and smells like I&#x27;m at the beach all day long!!!</li>
    <li> Not greasy, not heavy. Great product for the sun. Easy to use, great for price, doesnot dull hair. Recommend for those looking for sunblock for scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> So I bought this for camping - bears and all - and wanted unscented sunscreen.  The webpage clearly states that it is unscented, but if you look at the ingredients it has &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; listed.  I of course didn&#x27;t notice this until after I bought it and sprayed it on myself, smelled it, then checked the ingredients.  Complete false advertising.  The fragrance is quite strong.  If you are looking for unscented sunscreen go elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I buy several bottles every summer. The only problem is I have to spray on a thick layer because of my light blonde hair, so my hair ends up very stiff and sticky. Overall, this product protects my scalp and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Our favorite sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it on the golf course once, and now my only complaint is it isn&#x27;t easier to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much better coverage and lasts so much longer than the aerosol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as if the lords of the sunblock left us with the perfect block, and then decided to hide it. I hope it gets stocked more often.</li>
    <li> Works well for scalp and not greasy!</li>
    <li> It works as a head spray very well. You can protect your scalp in the sun without a hat if you need to.</li>
    <li> Love this product and this is the best price ever!</li>
    <li> I play golf all summer, but I don&#x27;t like wearing a hat. This stops the sunburn of my scalp, the top of my ears, and my face.</li>
    <li> i never used this on scalp, but I use it on arms/body b/c it is quick dry - spray on, wipe once, and thats it.  Protection is decent - -need to reapply.  Wish they would make more of this type of ST lotion - I hate &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> This is great for quick applications.  It is similar to the aerosol type spray but it lasts so much longer.  You do have to &amp;#34;rub it in&amp;#34; after spraying but it covers well, and is water resistant. It does not spray upside down.</li>
    <li> It was advertised as scalp spray. It&#x27;s regular sunblock. Deceiving!</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping my skin safe from harmful rays of the sun. Doesn&#x27;t wash off in water easily.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT for children, because it is not the sticky dirt magnet that the creams are.  Ditto if you are backpacking or doing anything else that gets you dirty.  Being a liquid, you can unscrew the top and bring a wee bit in a Nalgene container, lessening the load in your pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a fan of the Kinesis sunblock sprays, such as Mountain Equipment Coop and Costco formerly sold in Canada, this is very nearly the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: instead of spraying it onto the skin from a distance, spray a little into the palm of your hand, and rub it into the skin.  That both ensures the sunblock is properly and evenly applied, and does not waste so much sunblock to the wind.</li>
    <li> You may realise by now that was an allergic reaction.. this should work great for most people. Sorry it didnt work out for you , but ... for 99% of people this should be awesome... I like to keep one in the car , I never know what I&#x27;ll end up getting myself into</li>
    <li> We have used this sun screen for years even though it is hard to find (except on Amazon.com!)  It goes on easily and provides great protection as well as a very goo value compared to the continuous spray sun screens.  This bottle will last probably 10 times longer than one can of the continuous spray.  Great for applying on squirming kids who hate to stand still for sun lotion.  I only wish it came in an SPF 50.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen. I use while doing yard work and running. The pump spray allows easy application to the back and it dries quickly. Just what I needed during these &amp;#34;dog days&amp;#34; in the Deep South.</li>
    <li> We love it as it&#x27;s not greasy and easy to apply.  With being out in the sun for golf, it&#x27;s perfect for my  husband.</li>
    <li> I ordered it from amazon directly, knowing there are fake products here and there. Im really disappointed, they sent me an expired product, there is an expiration date stamp on the bottom and it was expired in 2012. It smells terrible, like it gone bad. Sprayed it on my hand and it started burning, i had to wash it asap!!! The worst part is Amazon says &amp;#34;its a hazardous item and cannot be returned&amp;#34;... ($6.47)  Trash can.</li>
    <li> If you have thinning hair like I do (Male - 55) this is an excellent scalp protectant! Not greasy, oily etc. I have been searching for one since I was using Nioxin ( which is no longer available) This is a lot cheaper and just as good!  I love the sun and this passes the test with an A!</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and performs well. However, it does appear to suffer a bit during shipping. Both bottles I received had leaked, one of them losing nearly 1/3 of it&#x27;s contents. Also, pay attention to the shipping information on this product if you need it quickly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Shipping Information: This product may not be available for 1 or 2 day shipping due to federal regulations that require it to ship via ground ship methods only.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. I wish they had a more natural version, but I like the feel of this so much, I&#x27;m willing to sacrifice.  The feel of it is almost like a powder once it dries, which a like alot. I&#x27;ve only ever used it on my body, not my scalp, so I can&#x27;t comment on what it does in your hair, though.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and just feels good on your skin.</li>
    <li> love that it&#x27;s not greasy!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dermatologist told him to keep his head covered to avoid further skin damage and/or skin cancer. Since he works at a car dealership, he is frequently outside and wearing a baseball cap or other head covering is not really an option. I did some research and found this product.  It used to be called Hair and Scalp Spray. This really does the trick for him. He sprays it on his head every day, and has not had any further issues to date. I highly recommend it, especially if you or the men in your life have a receding hairline or other thinning hair issue and need to use an SPF.</li>
    <li> We love this spray for hard to reach areas and legs.  Good coverage for all day sun. Stays put in the water. Great for hair part line!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Less messy than the lotions. Love the pump bottle as there is less waste than those aerosol cans and you are less likely to inhale the product. Hard to find in stores, so glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> Great protection for your scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a soccer referee, so I spend a lot of time in the sun, and I cannot wear a hat (not part of the uniform).  My hair is a little thin in the front and back.  A couple sprays of this product on the exposed spots and I&#x27;m good for a few hours.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat and greasy.  It&#x27;s sort of like hair spray might look in your hair, but it&#x27;s not quite as rigid.  It works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use on head will dry out hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. Works great for when were tubing down the river.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Not greasy (although it does leave a texture on your hair, almost like flexible hairspray).  Works great! Can spray on body, but I use it in my hair since my hair is thin and my scalp gets burned as a result.  My husband also loves this stuff (and he typically doesn&#x27;t care what kind of SPF he uses).  Great Product!!</li>
    <li> As others have said, this stuff is dangerous.  We used this recently while at the beach for a few hours, being sure to regularly reapply and mostly staying in the shade.  Both my husband and  I came away with bad sunburns.  The only exception was on my shoulders, where I had used up the last of some cheap-o Walgreens traditional SPF 30.  I didn&#x27;t even reapply the regular sunscreen and was fine.  I don&#x27;t know if the product really doesn&#x27;t provide the SPF it claims or if it is just difficult to achieve adequate coverage with it (though I&#x27;ve used Aveeno spray-on sunscreen before, which worked great), but this stuff is not at all protective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells terrible--almost like a skunk scent.  I threw out the better part of the bottle because the smell started permeating my travel bag.  Basically, this stuff stinks in every way.</li>
    <li> The kids seemed to like it; but, I did notice a little red.  Maybe they did not do a good job of applying</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen, easy to apply and dries fast. The only issue could be that smells a bit like alcohol and at the beginning feels a bit sticky.</li>
    <li> Wanted something to spary on my part and didnt leave my hair greasy feeling.  Works and not too strong of a scent that the guys like it too.</li>
    <li> We used to be able to buy this at the store. Thank heavens for Amazon. My husband mountain bikes, water skis and this is a very good products. Thanks</li>
    <li> A few of use got together and shaved our heads to show support for a friend going through Chemo.  Anyway, had to use something to protect the scalp from the sun and this did the trick. Just a word of warning, sweat will make this run and it stings when it gets into your eyes.</li>
    <li> Seems to go a lot farther than the aerosol. It is a bit sticky when it first goes on like most spray. Works very well though.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what people expect from a spray sunscreen.  After you spray it you still need to rub it in to make sure you get full coverage  I have used this sunscreen while working outside and exercising with great results. I like the manual spray because I don&#x27;t feel I am wasting half of it into the air.</li>
    <li> I like this for quick application- easy to apply for myself  given all the chemicals, won&#x27;t use on the kids, but willing to sacrifice chemicals for easy quick application for myself.</li>
    <li> Prior to using this Banana Boat Sunscreen spray my fair haired daughter would get sunburned in the part of her hair. This product works great to prevent that. It is a bit oily, but I would expect that in a waterproof product. It definitely beats spreading sunscreen on her scalp. A couple of squirts and she is on her way. It washes out easily with no sticky or oily residue left behind. My husband has used it as regular sunscreen on his body with good results, too. This is the third year that I have used this, and I will continue to buy it as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> lol well its sunblock....</li>
    <li> Alcohol is either the second or third ingredient.  This stuff works, obviously.  It just stinks for about 5 minutes after application.</li>
    <li> Perfect when your doing outdoor activities. Always lasts a long time whether its on the beach or at the pool</li>
    <li> Out of all the sunscreen application types (lotion, aerosol, and spray bottles like this) this is by far the best. Fine misty spray easily covers what you are spraying with a light coating. It is by far the best thing to use to spray on your face/scalp/neck, and it works just as great on arms/legs as well. I keep a bottle in my golf bag, each car and garage. SPF 30 isnt the highest SPF, but it is certainly high enough to be effective for a few hours of being out in the sun, probably not good enough for young kids out all day. Highly recommended because of the ease of use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product that works on hair w/o weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and then was unable to find it at retailers.&lt;br /&gt;I first thought the line discontinued it fro the more popular aerosol can types .&lt;br /&gt;Saw this on Amazon and was thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I like to hike and backpack between 10 and 13,000 feet in Colorado. Also I&#x27;d rather not wear a hat. My preference is alcohol based quick drying sunscreens for my thinning top and face. This product meets all my sun protection needs, EXCEPT the smell. An hour after application I&#x27;m still overwhelmed by a sweet citrus odor that limits where I can apply the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Previously I had used a similar Bullfrog product that offered identical protection with no odor.</li>
    <li> Just came back from the lake and used this. GREAT STUFF! Dries fast, stays out of eyes, and kept me from getting burnt. Hard to find in stores so purchasing several more on Amazon.</li>
    <li> In my plans for my trip to Jamaica, I knew I was going to have my hair braided, and I needed something to protect my scalp from burning in the hot sun.  I saw this and ordered it, what a find!!  When I arrived in Jamaica, I had my hair done, and the girl recommended using a scarf to protect my head instead of the spray.  Since the bottle said &amp;#34;body and scalp&amp;#34;, I used it on my body, which left me with a nice tan and no burning! I applied in the morning, sunbathed, swam in the ocean and the pool, reapplied mid-afternoon, and never even got pink, just tan.  I am fair skinned, and I recommend this product for anyone traveling to a region where the sun is hot and the weather is warm! Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Amazon sent the wrong items.  It is quik-dri but it is not for body and scalp as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up giving it away.  Would re-order, but afraid I will get same item over again..  Thinking maybe the item is stocked in wrong location.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for sunscreen for my almost 2 year old daughter&#x27;s scalp.  She has a full head of curly hair but her scalp often gets burned, as she refuses to keep a hat on.  Based on reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It makes her hair feel so nasty.  I won&#x27;t be using this for that purpose anymore.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well to protect my scalp from sun burn on my vacation. I did not use it on my face</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t yet used this.  Am saving it for our beach vacation.  It&#x27;s the first spray I&#x27;ve seen that&#x27;s for body and scalp---I always burn my head!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  It is my favorite suntan lotion.  I put it on before I work in the yard.  It goes on very easy, being a light spray oil, and it never lets me down.  I never get burned.  I spray it on my arms and legs and rub it in.  I spray it on my hands to do my neck, nose, ears, and face.  Even when I sweat it still seems to work.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I just love the fact it is a spray and fast drying. With 3 bouncing balls for kids who just never seem to be able to stand still, it is easy to get on and they are willing to have a regular repeat of the treatment. The aerosol can spray seems to run out much faster than this one. It protects well.</li>
    <li> This one does contain oxybenzone and vitamin A which should be avoided in sunscreens now. It accumulates in your body and can cause developmental/reproductive toxicity, immune problems, organ system toxicity, hormone disruption, and cellular changes. There are lots of sunscreens without these ingredients (even the chemical sunscreens are reformulating to get rid of this and not just the physical ones with zinc or titanium oxide).</li>
    <li> this was the best price for this, love the easy spray for my kids and my hubby can use this on his shaved head.</li>
    <li> This Banana Boat spray is sticky. Your skin feels like it&#x27;s wearing a coating of ick.</li>
    <li> Worked great - just the pump got clogged at beach.</li>
    <li> Works well. Bought it for warped tour, out in the sun all day, this definitely helps. Never go without it again.</li>
    <li> it dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t clog your pours like lotions do.  Those lotions make me sweat right away and the Banana Boat doesn&#x27;t do that at all.  I was worried that I can&#x27;t find it in the stores so I was glad to find it at Amazon.  Please keep carrying it.</li>
    <li> Only thing that keeps my head from burning when in the sun.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in time, but was unable to take on the plane due to size. My error. I have used Banana Boat in the  past and it is a wonderful sunscreen. That&#x27;s why I ordered it again.</li>
    <li> One of the few pump sprays available Does not waste spray like the aerosols do, actually get your money&#x27;s worth.  Nice not to get your hands full of creme or empty out a can in one spray.</li>
    <li> Works well. I didn&#x27;t get burnt.</li>
    <li> Just back from Mexico using this product and it worked perfect. My scalp and forehead tanned good with it also.</li>
    <li> By far the best product on the market!</li>
    <li> I use a ton of sunscreen. In the past when I&#x27;ve been in situations where I can&#x27;t wear a hat (beach, pool, water parks, theme parks where the hat goes flying off on the rides... ) I&#x27;ve used regular lotion or spray sunscreen in my hair which does leave a bit of a sticky, greasy mess (still better than a sun burn). This product is awesome. It isn&#x27;t greasy, it does have a bit of a \\&quot;stiff\\&quot; texure almost like a light hair spray, but it also gives coverage when in water. We used it recently at Disney walking around, and while in the pool... none of use got sunburned scalps (used it on myself and two small children). Would I prefer a sun screen for my scalp that felt like a leave-in conditioner? Sure. But since no one has come up with one, this is the best alternative I&#x27;ve come across so far... before that I was smearing sun lotion on our hair (talk about goopy) or spraying in the sunscreen (leaves your hair _really_ sticky and stiff). Depending on how long you&#x27;re in the water I do recommend you reapply it. I towel dried our hair and reapplied every 90 minutes or so.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at Kmart and tried it at the beach. It left a sticky film on my skin. I had also sprayed it where I part my hair so my scalp wouldn&#x27;t burn. Well, my hair was stuck like glue or a ton of hair spray. I took it back to the store and I&#x27;m still looking for something I like.</li>
    <li> My family lives in Southern California and we go to the beach at least once a month, year round, to do sand sculpting. If sunblock runs into my eyes it will prevent me from finishing the sculpture. I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds... lotions, sprays, even stick sunblock. This is the only one I&#x27;ve found that won&#x27;t run in my eyes. I wish I owned stock in this! Wonderful.</li>
    <li> The stuff works, and I like being able to pour it into smaller bottles so I don&#x27;t have to constantly carry around the 6 ox bottle.  Be warned, however, that while Amazon has improved their shipping of this item (now wrapping each bottle in a separate bag), I still get leaks whenever I order the stuff.  The last shipment I had was the best yet, but one of the bottles still leaked a fair amount.</li>
