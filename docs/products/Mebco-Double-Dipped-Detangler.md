      <li>Great product very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Wonderful comb for long hair.  </li>

      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the way it performed when attempting to detangle my hair when wet, and eventually threw it</li>
      <li>I loved it so much...</li>
      <li>I have baby fine curly hair</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll love them as much as I do!!  </li>

      <li>It reduces the combing time significantly.</li>
      <li>Worth it for the price!</li>
      <li>I find this comb is great at removing tangles from wet hair using a spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>Great for entangling wet hair.</li>
      <li>But good luck getting the color you actually request!</li>
      <li>It distributes hair color during a touch up so evenly and quickly.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>But I discovered one great hidden talent it has.</li>
      <li>These work really well and are much more gentle on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything else to match its amazing ability to comb through long, curly hair without creating or exacerbating tangles.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, and this is perfect for getting out micro tangles that other combs just make worse or tear out.</li>
      <li>Works so well on my super fine hair, especially after a shower!</li>
      <li>My first purchase was from ultra</li>
      <li>I bought a similar comb many years ago.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite type of comb, I have several</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty sturdy, but I could break it</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re really concerned about the color, be aware that you may not get what you order.</li>
      <li>it shipped fast and feels unbreakable.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>It goes to work gently separating the hairstrands in a gliding unstressful way, and even works under the shower.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t live without this comb !</li>
      <li>i highly recommend this and the seller.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>but I needed a new one,</li>
      <li>This is actually my second comb--my first one was \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; and never returned.</li>
      <li>it detangles without pulling and is completely painless on my very sensitive scalp.</li>
      <li>It has nice color (black with white/ black tips) which reminds of Benefit cosmetic lipstick tube.</li>
      <li>I have long coarse straight hair.  </li>
      <li>Got this for my 8 year olds very thick and super straight hair because she is always fighting me on getting the tangles out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now completely natural, and was inspired to re-purchase this detangling comb when the stylist who cut the relaxed ends from my hair used it to detangle the hair when dry and wet, and another stylist who detangled natural hair much longer than mine</li>
      <li>Used with either L&#x27;Oreal or Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s hair detangler, this comb works very, very well at getting through the mess.  </li>
      <li>I was seeing too many broken hairs gather in my traditional comb.  </li>
      <li>I have very thick and wavy hair and tangle easily.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate the fact that I can shop off of my little hand-held computer--my Smartphone!</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t mind it really, though, because I have pretty thick hair and a person supposedly loses about 100 follicles just throughout the day.</li>
<li> a must have for long hair</li>
<li> Especially if you use it to prevent tangles from happening, by combing it out while it is still wet from a shower it can be effortless taking minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used the comb several times on wet hair.  </li>
<li> It gets the job done in 2-3 minutes on long hair!!  </li>
<li> I meant to say that I bought this black one and the red one-</li>
<li> This one is very heavy duty and appears this will last a long time!</li>
<li> The teeth are larger than ordinary combs with the tips rounded so that it doesn&#x27;t damage your scalp when combing in addition to the teeth being staggered which, seems to spread apart when coming through.</li>
<li> So, I would recommend this to any person who has thick or curly hair, but I would not recommend it to people who have thin hair or rarely have tangles.</li>
<li> This is not a big comb, but the teeth are thick &amp; sturdy, &amp; it glides through my hair effortlessly.  </li>
<li> I lose much less hair after shampooing.  </li>
<li> I had it a long time, and when I searched for another one it was hard to find--until I found it on Amazon.</li>
<li> I have really thick hair and have broken teeth out of multiple prior purchases!  </li>
<li> I have fairly thin, short hair, but it is getting brittle with age.  </li>
<li> I use it everyday, instead of my brush..doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out</li>
<li> There was much less tangled hair then!</li>
<li> The price is unbelievable.</li>
<li> With her hair, it is a process, but we get the job done with no crying or anger.  </li>
<li> someone with thick curly hair tangles happen.</li>
<li> this is too small!</li>
<li> So I never imagined that it would be so difficult for me to replace one that lost teeth  after being shut in a drawer, but</li>
<li> But it was still a bit disappointing.</li>
<li> months without one were literally painful with over two feet of hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have long coarse straight hair.  I use this comb to detangle my hair after showering.  I also use it with a hair dryer to straighten my hair.  It&#x27;s perfect!  The price is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> This is not a big comb, but the teeth are thick &amp; sturdy, &amp; it glides through my hair effortlessly.  I use this in conjunction with my detangles brush and I am pleased how well it works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;a a comb.  What can I say...It&#x27;s a nice comb.  Very sturdy.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> This Mebco comb with a handle is a surefire problem-solver for those with tangly, uncooperative tresses.  It goes to work gently separating the hairstrands in a gliding unstressful way, and even works under the shower. It takes all the pain out of combing, and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out at the roots.  But I discovered one great hidden talent it has. It distributes hair color during a touch up so evenly and quickly.  I just apply the touch-up color to the ends of the teeth of the comb, and run it through my hair.  It gets the job done in 2-3 minutes on long hair!!  I&#x27;m in love with this comb and just ordered a batch to have on hand for spares and to give to my daughters and friends.  They&#x27;ll love them as much as I do!!  Thank you, Mebco Company, and please ALWAYS make and sell this gem of a comb!!</li>
    <li> love this comb.. I use it everyday, instead of my brush..doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out</li>
    <li> I bought a similar comb many years ago.  At that time, my hair was chemically relaxed.  I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the way it performed when attempting to detangle my hair when wet, and eventually threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now completely natural, and was inspired to re-purchase this detangling comb when the stylist who cut the relaxed ends from my hair used it to detangle the hair when dry and wet, and another stylist who detangled natural hair much longer than mine while wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mebco Detangling Comb is well-made, and doesn&#x27;t snag my hair while detangling.  I&#x27;ve used the comb several times on wet hair.  While it detangles effectively, I seem to shed more hair in comparison to when I use my wide-tooth detangling comb.  Perhaps that is the point: To remove shed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the Mebco Detangling Comb, but, I cannot say at this point that it is a favorite detangling comb at this point.</li>
    <li> Great for entangling wet hair.</li>
    <li> This comb actually does detangle your hair! I use it every day after the shower and it works better than my wide-toothed comb at getting out the tangles. However, unfortunately, it does seem to pull out a lot more of my hair than my wide-toothed does. I don&#x27;t mind it really, though, because I have pretty thick hair and a person supposedly loses about 100 follicles just throughout the day. So, I would recommend this to any person who has thick or curly hair, but I would not recommend it to people who have thin hair or rarely have tangles.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and have broken teeth out of multiple prior purchases!  This one is very heavy duty and appears this will last a long time!</li>
    <li> These detangler combs are what I needed.I meant to say that I bought this black one and the red one-yet they both are great since I decided to go natural.I really appreciate the fact that I can shop off of my little hand-held computer--my Smartphone! Thank you Amazon for being there when I really,really need you!</li>
    <li> This style of Detangler comb use to be very easy to find. In every  pharmacy and department store. So I never imagined that it would be so difficult for me to replace one that lost teeth  after being shut in a drawer, but it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone with thick curly hair tangles happen. I find this comb is great at removing tangles from wet hair using a spray bottle.  Especially if you use it to prevent tangles from happening, by combing it out while it is still wet from a shower it can be effortless taking minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My months without one were literally painful with over two feet of hair. I am glad to have mine again. I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to get one of these combs locally and couldn&#x27;t find one. The teeth are larger than ordinary combs with the tips rounded so that it doesn&#x27;t damage your scalp when combing in addition to the teeth being staggered which, seems to spread apart when coming through.</li>
    <li> Works well on granddaughter&#x27;s tangled hair when she gets out of the pool.  Used with either L&#x27;Oreal or Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s hair detangler, this comb works very, very well at getting through the mess.  I work the detangler through her hair with my fingers, let it set a minute, then begin combing at the ends of her strands.  With her hair, it is a process, but we get the job done with no crying or anger.  Oh for the days when swim caps were on-trend!  There was much less tangled hair then!</li>
    <li> Works so well on my super fine hair, especially after a shower!</li>
    <li> My favorite comb after shampooing my hair!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 8 year olds very thick and super straight hair because she is always fighting me on getting the tangles out. Now she won&#x27;t let me brush her hair with anything but this so I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> This is actually my second comb--my first one was \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; and never returned. I had it a long time, and when I searched for another one it was hard to find--until I found it on Amazon. This is a great comb that will last forever. I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My first purchase was from ultra and I need another one for my daughter. This comb makes tangles disappear with ease. My daughter never complains now when I style her hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s weird to say you have a favorite comb, but...this is my favorite comb. I haven&#x27;t found anything else to match its amazing ability to comb through long, curly hair without creating or exacerbating tangles. It is awesome. Five stars, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you order through an Amazon Merchant (like I did), be warned that you may not get the color you think you are ordering. The seller I purchased this comb from sent me a different color than was advertised. Not a deal breaker. (It is a comb, after all.) But it was still a bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb and it works. Worth it for the price! It&#x27;s pretty sturdy, but I could break it so the only thing that could it make it beter is stronger frame.</li>
    <li> Great quality comb for reasonable price and free shipping.  I have very thick and wavy hair and tangle easily. This comb work likes a charm. It reduces the combing time significantly. It has nice color (black with white/ black tips) which reminds of Benefit cosmetic lipstick tube.</li>
    <li> Always need an extra around the house. Now I have it in a diffrent color  too. Great product very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> excellent comb, I love this painless comb.  I use Wen and was looking for something that would glide through my hair...I loved it so much...I bought 3!!</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair, especially after shower. Also, since I tend to get some knots in my hair, while in the shower , I like to put my hair conditioner on and let that sit while I wash the rest of my body. Then, I brush it with this and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite type of comb, I have several but I needed a new one, so glad I found it here. I have baby fine curly hair</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without this comb ! a must have for long hair</li>
    <li> Wonderful comb for long hair.  I lose much less hair after shampooing.  My hairdresser found this and recommends to her clients.</li>
    <li> this comb is wonderful. it shipped fast and feels unbreakable. it is bright crayon color purple, shiny, and does not break even my two feet of baby fine hair. it detangles without pulling and is completely painless on my very sensitive scalp. i highly recommend this and the seller.</li>
    <li> I have fairly thin, short hair, but it is getting brittle with age.  I was seeing too many broken hairs gather in my traditional comb.  These work really well and are much more gentle on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I ordered two combs, one for home and one for my gym bag.  They were both supposed to be purple (that was the only Amazon Prime color), but one of the ones that came was peach.  For me, that was a bonus, though not at all a big deal.  But if you&#x27;re really concerned about the color, be aware that you may not get what you order.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, and this is perfect for getting out micro tangles that other combs just make worse or tear out.</li>
    <li> They say size doesn&#x27;t matter. Well in this case it does....this is too small!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb. But good luck getting the color you actually request! I bought a purple one and got a blue one (which is actually way darker than the picture shows). But whatever. It&#x27;s a $5 comb.</li>
