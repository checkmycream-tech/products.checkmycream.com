      <li>Smells so sweet and fruity.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait until I run out of my other perfumes so that I have a good excuse to buy a new Happy Heart!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wore this one since I was 16 and I&#x27;m 34 now but about five years ago I started wearing the happy heart when it came out. I love both of them and have them both on hand at all times. I also like the little tiny bottle of happy to put in my purse.  I get compliments all the time about how good I smell!</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s my fav fragrance. Excellent price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It smells great and lasts long enough for the price.</li>
    <li> arrived in good time. smells great scent last good amount of time as well.</li>
    <li> Well this is a matter of personal preference. Bought for my GF. I&#x27;m a guy and think it&#x27;s OK but prefer the way she smells naturally. She loves it so I&#x27;m in good graces so worth it  I think.</li>
    <li> Be sure to try the Happy Heart Body Wash!  It is SO YUMMY, I swear you will be tempted to taste it!  This fragrance is THE BEST I have ever purchased; it is so light, so delicate.....it reminds me of when my Mom used to put a little vase of orange blossoms on my nightstand, next to my open bedroom window.....definitely  one of the BEST ways to start your day!&lt;br /&gt;One warning, however:  some drugstores (CVS, for example) sell a perfume called \\&quot;Happy Heart by Clinique\\&quot;, but it is SO not the real thing!  I called Clinique about this, and they told me that CVS is NOT supposed to be selling Clinique (and speaking of \\&quot;watered down\\&quot;.....this \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; is AWFUL)!  So, I just thought I would pass this info on......just because it says \\&quot;Clinique\\&quot; on the box doesn&#x27;t make it so!&lt;br /&gt;Have a wonderful Holiday Season, and do so with a \\&quot;Happy Heart\\&quot;!!  Thanks for reading!  ((((Hugs!))))</li>
    <li> this product was a gift</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance so nice and light.  Great for everyday or even an evening out.</li>
    <li> I wear my Happy Heart everyday as my scent, it&#x27;s so fresh and clean for everyday. Love it, Thanks for such a great price and free shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for 11 years now. Started using it in college and was told all the time that it smells like a &amp;#34;pretty girl&amp;#34; perfume. Guys would ALWAYS compliment me on it. It is still my husband&#x27;s favorite scent on me:) I have tried other fragrances in between, mainly Coach Poppy (classic red) and DKNY Be Delicious (classic green). Although I like all three this is the one I always come back to. It is light and never overpowering yet it has the best staying power. I get way more compliments on Happy Heart than I do with the other two hands down! You can&#x27;t go wrong on this one! I can&#x27;t wait until I run out of my other perfumes so that I have a good excuse to buy a new Happy Heart! Best fragrance on the market by far!!</li>
    <li> This perfume has a nice light aroma. It smells very good and lasts a long time. I love it.</li>
    <li> All products I have ordered have met all of my expectations. Great service and products.</li>
    <li> Product as described.  My girlfriend loves this perfume.  It is her favorite.  I&#x27;ll make sure she always has a supply.</li>
    <li> My moms favorite perfume\great gift. She cried</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! Smells so sweet and fruity. I love anything by Clinque. Came on time too.</li>
    <li> I had a tester tube of this perfume and loved it. In ordering it online, I was little nervous that the big bottle wouldn&#x27;t smell like the tester but it did. This perfume is perfect for any occasion. It&#x27;s subtle enough for the day and smells sexy enough for the evening.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Happy Heart on my wife.  This is a yearly purchase for me since both my wife and I really like the aroma that this fragrance has.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume!!! the item is just as described and it lasted longer than I thought! It smells so good!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent it always puts me in a good mood. After my bath I spray it up high in the air then I step under the falling mist.</li>
    <li> My signature fragrance. I squirt on a lil behind each ear and on my wrists every morning now. It stays with me all day! Happy Heart makes me Happy!</li>
    <li> Exactly as it was described.  My wife was so excited to get this product again.  Amazon always makes our purchase so easy!</li>
    <li> This is my signature perfume, never fails someone always comments on it.&lt;br /&gt;Good value, great delivery.  Easy to find HAPPY, but not so easy to fine HAPPY HEART</li>
    <li> I receive so many compliments when I wear Happy Heart, to me it will always be my #1 fragrance choice!!!!</li>
    <li> My mom will love it for her bday!!</li>
    <li> Love it and received on time.</li>
    <li> This perfume is really amazing, fresh, long lasting scent. I was afraid when i bought this perfume from amazon because of the cheaper price compared to the market, i am pleased that i got it from amazon, it&#x27;s definitely real and not fake. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> A scent worth every cent.</li>
    <li> This scent is so soft and lovely.  You can wear it all day and still smell it once your home.  Not a overpowering scent just enough kick to make a bold statement.</li>
    <li> I love Clinique. I&#x27;ve been wearing Happy, for the past year, and wanted to try Happy Heart. I love the scent, but, I think i prefer Happy. However, this is beautiful, and may be a little lighter. Happy is such a unique smelling cologne, that it&#x27;s hard to compare the two.. This has more floral notes, where Happy is a little spicy and a touch of citrus. I get more compliments with the Happy, but, if you like light floral scents, this may be the perfume you prefer.  I alternate between the two now.</li>
    <li> love it this is my favorite cologne people stop me and ask my I have on great buy will buy again</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  Floral and not too sweet but very feminine.  It is not at all like the regular Happy scent.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this cologne.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I have to say I love it.  My mom always wore Clinique&#x27;s Aromatics Elixer which has a much heavier denser scent. This has a very clean and bright smell but there is something indescribable that triggers a nostalgic effect in me. It does not smell like Aromatics Elixer, however there is an underlying note which brings me back to sitting in the bathroom with my mom when I was maybe 4 or 5 watching her do her make-up and smelling her perfume.  For this reason this perfume maybe my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Beautiful everyday sense. Glad that I purchased it.</li>
    <li> 1 of my favorites  ☺☺</li>
    <li> my husband loves this on me and its light  and lasts</li>
    <li> for gf for christmas, came nice and fast. orderd i on monday and was here by end of the week</li>
    <li> I mix this with my &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34; by clinique for added scent.</li>
    <li> Love the scent.  First time to use this particular scent.  Good size bottle.  Fast shipper.  Very pleased with purchase overall.</li>
    <li> Smells so sexy and clean. What a wonderful fragrance for any age woman. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. I have been wearing it for years. It&#x27;s clean and light. I always get complements on it. It came just as I expected. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I received it just in time for an event that I needed it for. Reasonably priced and very happy I found your posting. I will return once I am empty.</li>
    <li> I receive exactly what I ordered. My wife loves it and wears it every day . A perfect gift for loved ones</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite go to  perfume and has been for years.  Very decent price and delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> my daughter requested this particular perfume for her birthday and I was thrilled with the discounted price…she got exactly what she wanted and I got a great deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Clinique fragrances for several years. I&#x27;ve always gotten Clinique Heart which I love but this time decided to try Happy Heart and loved it too!&lt;br /&gt;When I wear Happy it truly makes me feel happy! It is a clean and fresh scent that I love to wear on summer days. It is not overpowering and perfect for daily wear. I would not wear it at night but that is just my personal opinion. I wear different perfumes according to the weather, time of day and type of event.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone! It arrived perfectly packed and within a week.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this wonderful perfume on a customer. I was so impressed I asked her all about it. That night I ordered some for my wife. She loves it. Her sister came to visit and I ended up ordering some for her. My girlfriend smelled it on me so guess what happened?( just kidding about gf)</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous when I ordered perfume online, fearing that it would be old and not smell quite right, but it smells exactly like it should. The price beats what the beauty store in my area is selling it for.</li>
    <li> This is a very youthful scent, so I am not sure I would buy it again but it is the real deal. I gave it to my daughter because it smells better on her.</li>
    <li> My Sister in law loved it .It was a birthday gift. Loved  the smell.</li>
    <li> Everything you expect from Clinique Happy Heart! The product is great! And it arrived perfectly and on time - as ordered.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this purfume. Because I wear Clinique for men and she likes it I figured I would get this for her.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was the small bottle for the price. The last time I orders it, it was the larger one for the same price.</li>
    <li> I LIKED SO MUCH THIS PARFUM, iT&#x60;S A SOFT FRAGANCE  AND IT&#x60;S CHEAPER THAN OTHER PARFUMS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. .</li>
    <li> My wife loves the perfume But you really don&#x27;t save much On this particular brand It was only a dollar 75 cheaper than the mall</li>
    <li> Smell was stronger i expected and it has more floral than soaper smells which i wasnt going for when i ordered. It doesnt last very long it does soften up almost immediately after i spray it on however. Smell good</li>
    <li> I bought this and &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34; for my wife. &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34; is way better (drool) but this is nice too, just nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and always receive compliments!! Light, airy and always makes me feel HAPPY!!</li>
