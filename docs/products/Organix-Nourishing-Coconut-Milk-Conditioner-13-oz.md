      <li>The smell is absolutely amazing and I am buying again for sure!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would be for someone with fine hair, but for my hair type it is really great.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing, and works so well for the price.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and works</li>
      <li>my hair just feels so amazing and shiny afterwards.</li>
      <li>This is the absolute best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>because oils are definitely effective hydrating agents.</li>
      <li>I give OGX Conditioner-Sea Mineral moisturizer 1 star for its nice smell.  </li>
      <li>I really liked the scent of this conditioner, it made my hair feel soft,shiny,and taken care of.</li>
      <li>Wish Amazon sold the Brazilian Keratin Therapy kind.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast, smells great, conditions hair!!</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>I love applying this stuff because it feels so good on my hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>OGX hair products are by far the best hair combos I&#x27;ve used...</li>
      <li>I used it with the aragon oil shampoo (I think I spelled that right lol)</li>
      <li>Love love love this!</li>
      <li>Very light products for hair.</li>
      <li>Great conditioner; hair is super soft and silky, and smells great.</li>
      <li>It took me a while to understand that I had to stop using the shampoo and the conditioner together, so I would use them separately, mostly the conditioner because of the slip it gave my hair.  </li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s why I really LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>And the smell, oh god, couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair</li>
      <li>It works even better with heat if you sit under a dryer.</li>
      <li>My assumption is that this is because I have been leaving the ultra-thick conditioner on through most of my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>during winter i go with heavier conditioners and this one is better than their macadamia nut one.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the scent...but was too drying for me.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I love how it make my hair and scalp fee.</li>
      <li>Always make sure the ingredients are safe before you buy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells so good! Great price here on amazon too!</li>
    <li> Does not moisturize my hair and leaves it kind of dirty and difficult to brush. I tried rinsing extra time because I thought that might be the problem but still my hair was the same. Plus product does not have natural ingredients but chemical and harmful ones.</li>
    <li> I bought the big bottle of this one in Walmart for $9.99, and just after using it twice, I found out that it is not really organic. I read somewhere that Ceteraeth-20 is not good for our body, actually any ingredients ending with &amp;#34;ETH&amp;#34; should be avoided. Too bad, because I love the smell and it makes my hair shiny and volumized.. But well, I think it will just end up in the trash. My health is more important than saving the $9.99.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and so far works great.</li>
    <li> Great for natural hair like mine. Made my hair soft and noisturized!!! Love it. My hair transforned after one wash</li>
    <li> Is this good for weave?</li>
    <li> love!!! Hair feels so soft, shampoo and this are great together. Makes my hair feel and look shiny and healthy. Plus i love the coconut scent! Will buy again if i don&#x27;t find another organix product to fall in love with ;)</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this conditioner because it smells great. However, it left my hair dry and caused it to fall out more than usual. Also, it&#x27;s not organic, even though it comes up when you search for organic conditioner.</li>
    <li> leave white particles in hair after drying. Terrible product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this OGX conditioner for months now. I don&#x27;t shampoo, only condition. I love the way it makes my hair feel!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is damaged from repeated coloring and this conditioner makes it feel healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> I wanted to ADORE this product and the scent was what almost seduced into doing so. If you love coconut, the scent will not disappoint. However, it personally made my hair feel dry and crackly and not truly moisturized. I couldn&#x27;t bear the texture and was afraid to comb through and have my hair break. So, I washed my hair with my old shampoo and conditioner and felt better. It&#x27;s not all-natural as advertised either, look up some of the ingredients. Although, to give credit, it does not contain as many harsh/harmful chemicals as other brands. It is gentle despite having an ingredient or two that cannot qualify as organic. I used it on my younger sister&#x27;s hair and it worked fine. My sister&#x27;s hair is thicker and wavy, and mine is also thick but curlier. So certain hair types can benefit more :]</li>
    <li> Great conditioner and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Great Seller!!! Everything went perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Cheaper than Wal-Mart. Great price.</li>
    <li> It provides the necessary moisture to my  natural and tightly coiled locks. Love it... Hope the bottle was bigger.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells like heaven, and it makes my hair so shiny and easy to comb.</li>
    <li> Smells great but dries my hair out.</li>
    <li> OGX hair products are by far the best hair combos I&#x27;ve used...</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. A bit pricey, but it smells wonderful and gets great results.</li>
    <li> The positive thing about this shampoo and conditioner is that its made with a lot of all natural ingredients. The bad part is that in spite of the slightly high price I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in the texture of my hair after using it. My cousin has a softer texture of hair and it makes her hair look amazing! The smell is delightful though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with the accompanying shampoo for a few weeks and I&#x27;m really happy with it. I have color-treated hair and I shampoo every day, so it tends to get dry. This conditioner goes a long way towards restoring my hair&#x27;s moisture levels (important because it&#x27;s summer and humid where I live and I have a tendency to get frizz...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, this is easier to rinse out of my hair than the associated shampoo is. It is not a vegan product as it contains egg-derived ingredients. It also has two silicones (not a problem for me because silicones actually seem to do good things for my hair). You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been soft and manageable with this. (For really good results, follow up with some &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; detangling spray/leave-in.) It smells good and I like the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison purposes, I have waist-length, slightly wavy hair (*maybe* 2A if you know about that curl classification). This doesn&#x27;t change my waves. Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, the official brand name is now &amp;#34;OGX&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;Organix&amp;#34; and the company does not claim the ingredients are organic (though this was a point of contention at some point in the past, which is probably what precipitated the name change).</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it on my self and my dogs.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and smells good also.  LOVE this conditioner!</li>
    <li> I give OGX Conditioner-Sea Mineral moisturizer 1 star for its nice smell.  Very disappointed with this purchase...I needed a good conditioner and I spent $6.00 on this conditioner thinking it would really help.  I might as well not even used a conditioner...when I go to brush my hair after showering I have nothing but knots and my brush keeps getting stuck in my hair!  I will never ever buy their line of products ever again!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner. I used it with the aragon oil shampoo (I think I spelled that right lol) and it worked great. It works even better with heat if you sit under a dryer. I have finally found my shampoo and conditioner combo!</li>
    <li> very good conditioner with the coconut smel</li>
    <li> I bought this item and its complement shampoo from a local store.  I enjoyed the conditioner more for the slip it gave my hair, which is a blend of waves, loose and tightly coily curls that are both fine and coarse and both partly and fully straight strands.  Yes, this is my hair which is also natural. This product (and the shampoo) was purchased because I thought this product had high-quality ingredients and no bad ingredients but I was wrong.  The smell and the slip this product has are the only good things about this product; however, this product made my hair feel &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; and hard.  When used it goes on well, spreading to the hair but I needed to use a lot.  I have less of this product compared to the coconut milk shampoo which also made my hair feel hard.  It took me a while to understand that I had to stop using the shampoo and the conditioner together, so I would use them separately, mostly the conditioner because of the slip it gave my hair.  I haven&#x27;t bought this product or the shampoo again, and I have no intention to repurchase anything from this product line.  I don&#x27;t care how much marketing they put into making their products&#x27; packaging look alluring which is to trap you so they can get your money.  PLEASE read the reviews before you buy, and if you do, PLEASE know the store&#x27;s return policy.  Use within that time because you may become like me:  I should have used it sooner than later so I could have got my money back.  Did you know that this company was sued over its ingredients?  They were.  Also,  this company&#x27;s customer service is nonexistent; I emailed them about my experience using only these two products to cleanse my hair and scalp and I got no response.  That is no way to treat a customer.  Buyers, beware!</li>
    <li> I typically use only Aveda products, but this is my favorite conditioner. It smells amazing, and works so well for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this! It smells really good and it lasted me a long time, plus it was a little cheaper than it would have been in the store!</li>
    <li> makes my course dry hair soft and comb able. doesn&#x27;t smell too much like coconut but I don&#x27;t mind the smell. I care more about how my hair feels, which is great!</li>
    <li> I love the scent...but was too drying for me. Conditioner did not moisturize as well as I wanted it to. This will probably be a good product for those looking for a lightweight conditioner that isn&#x27;t too heavy, in which case I would recommend this. But since my hair needed a little more hydrating and moisturizing than this conditioner offers, I would NOT buy this next time. But I just LOVE the sweet coconut scent and it lasts pretty long.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it!</li>
    <li> love it... makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> It says organic, but it&#x27;s not. ( has some chemicals; as seen in other reviews and the packaging itself.) However, that doesn&#x27;t keep it from being wonderful. I have thinish, naturally wavy hair with a ton of natural volume. This conditioner not only smells great, but it makes my hair very soft (along with the matching shampoo). My hair gets oily after about 5 hours of using other products, but this makes my hair look and smell amazing. Love love love this! Plus I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s cruelty and sulfate free! Love it!</li>
    <li> Been using this prod for about a year now and I love how it make my hair and scalp fee.</li>
    <li> From what I&#x27;ve read, this product is incredibly hit or miss depending on your hair. My hair is thin, but I have a lot of hair and a natural wave. I also have color treated hair so I don&#x27;t know if that affected anything. I just bought the travel size of this to try on my trip (since you can&#x27;t get color treated safe shampoo in travel size at my local Target). In the shower, I could already feel my hair becoming dry and straw-like, and when it dried it only got worse and worse. I recommend buying the travel size before committing to the full size of this product in case you have a similar experience. I would have given this one star, but the smell is so incredible that it earned an extra star :).</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and works ok you just have to thoroughly rinse out your hair otherwise it still looks a little greasy. I love the organix products except they&#x27;re not organic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Nigerian girl with 4c hair that is very full, thick and coarse. It&#x27;s also extremely dry and moisture retention is my number one goal. This is the absolute best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s incredibly moisterizing and makes my hair so pillow soft.  Other conditioners don&#x27;t penetrate my hair like this  one.  I only shampoo once a month to get rid of product buildup, and I use this to cowash 2 to 3 times a week.  (The shampoo is just as awesome.) I wish I could give this more stars.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of products, but this is the best. I&#x27;ve never been so completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> i bought this coz i have psoriasis on my head  and it need to be hydrated all the time ,it work like a magic&lt;br /&gt;my scalp is not itchy any more i nearly  stopped using my steroid gel ,but when it come to smoothing ur hair i think u can find better conditioners especially if ur hair is really dry ,but it improve my hair damages and it decreases the number of falling hair,i highly recommend it to treat ur hair and ur itchy scalp</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced conditioner, and love the smell.</li>
    <li> Not really nourishing. The coconut shampoo both smells and hydrates better than this conditioner. I have never used a conditioner that tangled my hair like this one does. Will not recommend to friends, however I LOVE OGX products, so this was a disappointment, I will stick to my normal OGX conditioner and shampoo</li>
    <li> Great conditioner; hair is super soft and silky, and smells great.</li>
    <li> this is probably my all time favorite conditioners. it smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling super soft. I love all off organix products and they all do wonders. but this coconut milk conditioner is where is it&#x27;s at.</li>
    <li> I GOT FOOLED BUT THE NAME ORGANIX,  IT HAS MANY CHEMICALS, I AM ALLERGIC TO MOST CONDITIONERS EVEN ORGANIC SO I THREW IT OUT.</li>
    <li> OK... doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as nice as some of their other products.  Wish Amazon sold the Brazilian Keratin Therapy kind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for only a week or so and my hair feels so much healthier. I love it! Best one I&#x27;ve tried from this brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love the smell and leaves my hair very soft &amp; manageable. Good price for size!</li>
    <li> Very good smell,effective hydration!</li>
    <li> Smells lovely but it weighs down my fine hair and leaves it &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; feeling.  And yes, I made sure I rinsed all of the product out of my hair.  Probably a good product, but not for my hair type.</li>
    <li> Blah - not for my hair. Makes it flat. This cream is too heavy and all the smell is really strong - like fake coconut. Like coconut tanning oil. I usually love this brand, but this product is too much for my hair. I have normal/coarse curly hair, so it can tolerate heavy products, but this is too much.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, makes my hair feel awesome.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner- it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than what I normally buy, but still cheaper than the salon stuff. The smell is great, not at all overpowering. It makes my hair really soft and strong, but I hoped for a bit more frizz control. I have 2c/3a hair, and I live in a humid area, but this does a great job of taking care of my hair. I love how rich and creamy it is- the first thing I noticed when I used it was how well it coated my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this brand on my allergy kids. it&#x27;s one of the few that they can both use. I have used this brand for over 5 years since they were babies, This one in particular is one of my favorites. My girls have very long hair (mid lower back length) with unruly curls. This makes their hair manageable, and shiny. I ran out recently and bought a different brand and it was really noticeable after a month. My little ones gorgeous shiny curls were suddenly brittle and dry at the ends for the first time in her life. I can&#x27;t use this on my own hair because I have very thin, very straight hair, it gets weighed down, but for my kids this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> Left my hair so soft and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells really good. It really helps with my  dry hair. Will buy again and again. Works wonders with your hair</li>
    <li> Just like any other ordinary conditioner, Nothing special.</li>
    <li> Really good brand.  Smells amazing and so fun.  Recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> OGX is a very overrated line and the coconut milk is no exception. The scent is blah and the quality is average at best. It does detangle pretty well, but still leaves my hair frizzy. It&#x27;s not anything great as far as moisturizing or shine. Definitely not the worst by any means, but I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product will make you want to go on vacation.  Hawaii to be precise.  I love this conditioner but I simply cannot afford to go on vacation so I use it sparingly.  But when I do use it, my hair looks, feels and smells like heaven.</li>
    <li> I shampo my kinky 4ab hair then sleep with this over night. Then next morning i rinse it out with cool water and my hair i  super super moisturized. This is deffinitely a staple in my cabinet</li>
    <li> Very nice, not sulfate free which is what I expected but I&#x27;m using it up and then I&#x27;ll order something sulfate free.</li>
    <li> during winter i go with heavier conditioners and this one is better than their macadamia nut one. my hair just feels so amazing and shiny afterwards.</li>
    <li> Excellent, I love this and the shampoo.  I purchased this one to have delivered to my Mom who recently went through Chemo.  This in combination with the shampoo and helping.</li>
    <li> I really liked the scent of this conditioner, it made my hair feel soft,shiny,and taken care of. I liked it.</li>
    <li> It smells great going on. After using it for a while I noticed my hair was getting really oily and sticky and waxy or something. Just thick and icky. Then I would be in bed trying to sleep only to get these wafts of what I can only describe as a hot manure pile in the sun. All it took was putting my hand into my hair and smelling the skin on my hand. I. WAS. HORRIFIED. My hair has NEVER smelled oily or bad but now it smelled rancid, as described above. I used a clean mint shampoo to wash this out and the smell went immediately away. After 2 weeks I decided to try this shampoo again, and after 2 days the stench came back. I almost jumped into the shower at 2am to get rid of it.    Reading other reviews here, I have to wonder if my recent mornings for the last few weeks looking like I am getting en eye infection (or sinus infection where it starts in the corners of the eyes) is from this shampoo like others have stated they have gotten after usage. I never got a sinus infection and the eye infection never progressed beyond an indication of one starting (in both eyes). Upon stopping the shampoo usage, these last few mornings my eyes are clear.    And yes, this product SOMEHOW makes your hair both oily gunky AND dry straw-like as heck. My hair has been breaking and falling out and I pawned it off as \\&quot;it&#x27;s Winter\\&quot; (you know, the So CA winter we are having and all with temps in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s...).    Just glad to see I&#x27;m not the only user with all of these issues with this product. A BIG NO from me on this one.from me on this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I bought this product awhile back and I have only used the shampoo and it was ok so then I thought \\&quot;Let&#x27;s try the conditioner!\\&quot;. Boy, do I wish I kept the receipt! This conditioner practically caused an apocalypse in my hair! It was matted, tangled, it was horrific. I had to wash my hair with different shampoo and conditioner to ease my hair enough for me to even pull it apart! Thank God I have thick hair otherwise, I would of just looked like I had bald spots after the whole thing! It took two of us to get my hair decent again to where we could manage it! I couldn&#x27;t believe how bad it was, I almost cut off all my hair because of this!. Never again will I buy any of their products!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this conditioner. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out what the perfect amount for my hair. Sometimes it needs more softness but if I put too much on it feels a bit stiff.</li>
    <li> Way to thick. Thick like Vaseline. I have long hair and I need to use a lot of this at once to get through all of my hair. It does not condition very well at all. It leaves my hair full if tangles and very hard to brush once towel dried.</li>
    <li> The conditioner and shampoo are fine, but the 13 oz bottle of conditioner is impossible to squeeze after about three uses.  For that matter, I had the same problem with a sample sized bottle of the conditioner. I ended up having to pop the entire top off (not easy to do) and slam the bottle against my palm for the last several uses to get conditioner out.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to have to do that again with the 13 oz bottle. The shampoo is not quite so difficult, but they really should redesign the bottles for this entire line.  I know that coconut oil is fabulous for hair which is why I wanted to use the Coconut Milk version (it also contains coconut oil), but I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t keep buying it because of the problem with the bottle.</li>
    <li> While I like the product I was disappointed to see that the bottle was not sealed and otherwise did not look &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.  I purchased the shampoo and it came in a closed plastic sleeve and with a seal around the opening of the bottle.  Leads one to wonder if this product could have been tampered with - not a comforting thought.</li>
    <li> I use this for my 3 yr old. She has very long hair and it snarls easily. We have been using this since she was 2 and it doesn&#x27;t hurt her eyes if I miss and she loves the scent. It&#x27;s very sensitive as well. She&#x27;s always had sensitive skin and usually reacts to scents and chemicals, but this doesn&#x27;t have any negative effects on her.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is great.. If you can get it out of the bottle. After the first few uses it just gets harder and harder to use due to the shape of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I started using organix a yera ago and i this by far is my favorite one! I love how soft my hair is and it doesnt seem to leave any build up. I love the smell, i sometimes combine the shampoo with the coconut water conditioner and the coconut milk conditioner. I feel the Coconut milk is a little more hudrating than the coconut water, but both work very well.</li>
    <li> I love how thick the conditioner is, its helped my hair a lot. I have dyed my hair over and over and its been really damaged but this makes it feel a whole lot better.</li>
    <li> I have only tried two of the several scents/versions of this product, the coconut milk and the argan oil. To me they were very similar in texture and what they did for my hair, which was basically nothing, except for making it smell fantastic (and the scent did last until the next wash). This is why I did not give a five star review. HOWEVER, I do still love this conditioner for other reasons! And here they are:&lt;br /&gt;  First, I like that it is sulfate and paraben free, this makes it a great candidate to use for the no-poo method. Although I am not entirely no-poo, I did try it with the argan oil conditioner for a while and liked it. I personally just couldn&#x27;t give up shampoo all together, so now I just use the conditioner to cleanse my hair on days that I definitely need to cleanse, but my hair is feeling too dry to shampoo (then I condition the ends with a richer conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;  I would also like to add that another reviewer gave this product one star due to it not being organic...and although the brand name may suggest that, they do not claim on the product anywhere to be organic, just all natural, which is not the same thing. At least it&#x27;s not animal tested. Whatever long named preservative they use could (or could not) be from a natural source. If you&#x27;re really concerned, then google it. Methylparaben occurs naturally in blueberries, yet is suspected to cause cancer!&lt;br /&gt;  ANYWAY! Here&#x27;s why I really LOVE this stuff. It&#x27;s the best shaving cream EVER! I&#x27;ve tried gentle soaps, oils, shave gels, etc. But this conditioner does a great job of conditioning my skin, and helps the razor glide over it without excessively clogging it (like most oils do). I seriously only use a large pea, or at most dime size blob for each entire leg! I have that awful \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; on my thighs, and although consistent moisturizing helps clear it up, I have never experienced a winter when I was completely clear....until I used this as a shaving cream! I have recently started applying it to my upper arms as well to see if it will help my troubled skin there (not shaving! just conditioning). So there&#x27;s my best kept beauty secret, hope it helps some of you!</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve been using it along with the coconut shampoo for years now, and no matter what else I try, these guys are the best for my hair (thick, long, straight, dry). It makes it easier to comb and I don&#x27;t get this crazy &amp;#34;just washed my hair&amp;#34; look even if it dries naturally. And the smell, oh god, couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
    <li> what do i say? wonderful stuff!!</li>
    <li> I was considering buying this conditioner because it came up when I searched for organic products; however, this line is NOT organic. In their ingredient list, Methylchloroisothiazolinone appears. This is a widely-used preservative in products and is a known human immune system toxicant. It is restricted in other countries production lines. Check it out at cosmeticsdatabase.com. Always make sure the ingredients are safe before you buy.</li>
    <li> I really think this conditioner is what has helped my hair tremendously after using the absolutely awful Suave Keratin Infusion Kit. I stopped using shampoo, and in fact have not used shampoo in 3 weeks. I massage the conditioner into my hair, let it sit while I&#x27;m shaving or washing in the shower, then rinse out. After that, I scrunch dry my hair with an old cotton t-shirt of my husband&#x27;s, apply a little of [[ASIN:B002PR2GLM One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Treatment 3.4 oz.]], a little leave-in conditioner like [[ASIN:B004JFO01W Silk Elements Mixed Silk Leave-In Conditoner]], and let my naturally curly hair air-dry. My hair has never looked more beautiful, and the curls are better defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first was recommended Organix Coconut Conditioner by a friend, I thought, \\&quot;Geez, this seems kind of spendy\\&quot;; but upon buying it (locally for $5.99), I realized that because the conditioner is thicker than most other cheap conditioners, it will last longer, and therefore is a good buy.</li>
    <li> After using Dove and Finesse hair products I thought I was loosing my hair.  Both products made my hair so baby fine I was ready to give up and into hair replacements.  A friend suggest Organix.  So I purchsed the shampooo, conditioner and mousse.  I have only 1 word to say...&amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;.  My hair has not felt so full, so thick, so soft in so long.  I can not believe it!!  I am a Organix user for life!!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.. It is the best smell that lasts and it makes really dry hair very manageable. i always buy these in 2s and 3s.  Must have if you love coconut scented products and if you have really dry hair.</li>
    <li> I was soooo excited to try this product but it came short to my expectations. It didn&#x27;t hydrate my 3b/3c curls. It gave me absolutely no slip, therefore causing it to be extremely difficult to detangle my curls, left my hair dry and weighed down. I was so disappointed. The formula is quite thick and it was soo hard to squeeze this out of the tube. This product just didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunatley.</li>
    <li> love the smell and works great</li>
    <li> I love this brand!! OGX, formerly organix, offers many wonderful shampoos and conditioners and this is one of them. I have baby fine hair and this &amp;#34;nourishing&amp;#34; formula leaves my hair soft and silky without being weighed down. I have used many different high end formulas, that cost 2-3 times as much, and hardly any of them work as well as this. Lathers great and smells amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and did soften my hair but I found it a bit heavy. Product details says it&#x27;s safe for color treated hair but it darkened my hair color. I prefer to use organic and this product is not, though they make it appear/sound like it is.</li>
    <li> When my hair is weak this conditioner has my hairs back and becomes my hairs back bone.... Love the smell it&#x27;s smells like a tropical island....</li>
    <li> I am very particular about haircare products because of the extensive damage I&#x27;ve done through years of coloring, blow drying, and flat ironing.  Last month, I stopped using conditioner because I could not find one that wouldn&#x27;t make my fine hair limp and greasy.  Because I love the smell of coconuts so much, I bought this product as a last ditch effort to find a conditioner that works with my hairtype.  I am SO glad I did!  The smell, the ingredients, the packaging and the price are absolutely spot on with this product!  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I buy this for the smell. It doesn&#x27;t do much for conditioning but it smells great compared to most other conditioners that leave my hair with a stinky chemical odor. I like light perfumey odors rather than fruity ones so I like the coconut fragrance in this.</li>
    <li> I usually use only fragrance-free hair products, but if you can tolerate the smell of coconut without any typical fragrance chemicals, this is a wonderful product I use regularly. Sometimes I do combine it with another conditioner and leave them on my hair after shampooing. They also make a great mousse for curly hair. Very light products for hair. Non greasy.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, smells great, conditions hair!!</li>
    <li> I use only coconut milk by OGX for my hair, occasionally different OGX product</li>
    <li> Amazing conditioner I am very happy with this product it makes my hair feel awesome</li>
    <li> This conditioner REALLY hydrates hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am placing 3 stars because it altered the color of my highlights. My polar blonde highlights went terribly brassy with this product, I was very disappointed because besides that, it works super well, it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different hydrating conditioners containing oils (argan oil, coconut oil, macadamia nut oil,...) because oils are definitely effective hydrating agents. When used at maximum strength (in a mask for example) the results are fabulous, my hair becomes silky and full of body, but the counterpart is that they naturally oxidize hair and therefore create awful brassy tones in blonde highlights.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo &amp; conditioner in a store after seeing an advertisement in a magazine for it.  This did not work for me at all.  I left the conditioner on for about 10 minutes and when I took the towel off my hair I immediately noticed how dry it felt!  After blow drying it, all I was left with was straw-like hair!  It wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl at all and felt very dry.  I&#x27;m not sure if your hair has to get used to this conditioner or what, but I dont plan on using it again.... Hopefully, I can return it to the store!</li>
    <li> good deal and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful conditioner and the shampoo is great too.  It smells so good and leaves hair feeling great.  Plus it is sulfate free.  But I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is on the expensive side so I rotate between this brand and another.</li>
    <li> If you have damaged hair, this is the product for you!! My hair used to always be so dry, but after using this I have never been so happy with my hair. The smell is absolutely amazing and I am buying again for sure!</li>
    <li> Really like this.  Clean, fresh smell and makes hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> When I was traveling last summer I ran out of my shampoo and conditioner I normally use which at the time was Matrix I believe. My Mom is a hair stylist so I have been using salon products since I was about 14 (I&#x27;m 40 now). Only on rare occasion have I used anything other than a salon shampoo or conditioner (while traveling for a night or 2 and once I tried Frizz Ease). Anyway, I&#x27;m coming from a Salon quality is the only thing that should touch my hair mentality. I chose this Organix shampoo and conditioner because I sometimes use pure raw coconut oil on my hair as a deep conditioning treatment and it leaves my hair soft, moisturized and shiny for days after. I also like that some of the ingredients are organic though as one reviewer pointed out, some are not which is a true bummer.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as soon as I started using this I noticed a big difference in the softness and shininess of my hair and it continued all the way through the entire bottle which lasted me about 5 months. I&#x27;ve gone completely off of salon products now and amusing this and the shampoo exclusively. I recommend this product. Also I should mention that I have long semi thick course medium brown hair. I don&#x27;t know how it would be for someone with fine hair, but for my hair type it is really great.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! It smells SO SO SO good! It smells just like coconut, cream, and cake! I love applying this stuff because it feels so good on my hair. Once I rinse it out, my hair feels very soft. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the scent doesnt last very long in my hair and it hasnt made my hair look as good as some other products have. Other than that, its very good!</li>
    <li> I only wash my hair 3x a week and use the OGX shampoo and conditioner when I do. This stuff is great! Not too strong of a coconut scent and keeps my hair looking moisturized but not greasy. Bottle lasts a long time too (even for my really long hair)- especially the conditioner because its so thick.</li>
    <li> I simply love this product! I recommend this product. Good price and good results for hair</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo. Fast delivery. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;A++</li>
    <li> I am a black womand and my hair looooove this product. A must have</li>
    <li> LOVEＴＨＩＳ！Smells amazing and makes your hair feel soooo soft</li>
    <li> Great hair product that has better ingredients</li>
    <li> The shampoo that goes with this does an amazing job making my hair soft and smooth.  This conditioner is just icing on the cake.  It smells delicious and I can tell it&#x27;s conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave any gunky residue in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I had been using the same shampoo and conditioner for far too long...while I liked my old brand, my colored hair was feeling straw-like and needed a change. On my next visit to the drug store, I found the Organix Nourishing Coconut Milk shampoo and matching conditioner. I LOVE the smell of coconut and the word \\&quot;nourishing\\&quot; looked promising for my dry hair, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With many shampoo/conditioner duos, the consistency of both products is either the same or very similar. Not with this duo! The shampoo is thinner while the conditioner is SUPER thick...like a very thick face cream or mask. This is great in every other way but getting it out of the bottle (see more on that below). I LOVE the thickness in terms of putting it on my hair and it staying there. I have thin, fine, short hair and most conditioners make my hair super limp and difficult to style if I don&#x27;t wash them off immediately after applying them. With this Organix Nourishing Coconut Milk conditioner, I can leave it on throughout shaving and cleansing my face and my hair never gets limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner both come in a rounded flip-top container. It isn&#x27;t the most well-designed bottle for use in the shower with wet hands. I generally don&#x27;t have a problem picking up the SHAMPOO bottle, flipping the lid and squeezing shampoo into my hand. However, the texture of the CONDITIONER makes it very difficult to squeeze into my hand. I have to use both hands to squeeze the bottle and then somehow try to catch the conditioner when it comes out. Stupid design for a conditioner this thick! If it hadn&#x27;t been for the difficulty of using the product, I&#x27;d have given the conditioner 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of both products is WONDERFUL (if you like the smell of coconut, which I do). Interestingly, while I am very fragrance sensitive when it comes to perfumey scents, I adore natural scents like coconut and vanilla, so while the coconut fragrance is very noticeable, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my hair did not undergo any miraculous transformation, it is definitely NOT straw-like anymore and I&#x27;m not having the problems with flyaways that I was having before I switched to these products. My assumption is that this is because I have been leaving the ultra-thick conditioner on through most of my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, while the brand name \\&quot;Organix\\&quot; may be mostly a marketing ploy, I do like that the products are sulfate free and that the bottles, even the ink and labelling, is all eco-friendly.t doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my hair did not undergo any miraculous transformation, it is definitely NOT straw-like anymore and I&#x27;m not having the problems with flyaways that I was having before I switched to these products.
