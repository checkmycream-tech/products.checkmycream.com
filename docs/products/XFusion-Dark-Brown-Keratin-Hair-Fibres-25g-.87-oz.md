      <li>He assures me that he will be a good looking bald guy, but until then he is a fan of this product:) I was referred this product by my stylist at Tribeca salon in Tampa, FL.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>As I did a search to reorder it, I noticed Xfusion&#x27;s good reviews and that it was much cheaper than Toppik</li>
      <li>This seems to go on thicker and stays longer and it doesn&#x27;t wash away as easily.</li>
      <li>IT WAS FINE FOR AWHILE.  </li>
      <li>It came super fast and keratin hair fibres is as good as any of the leading products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found the product on amazon since it is very challenging to obtain it at a local salon in Savannah, GA.</li>
      <li>I HAVE A FULL HEAD OF HAIR.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price??</li>
      <li>Has helped my self-confidence so much!</li>
      <li>Works great on african american natural hair.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty much used them all.  </li>

      <li>really works.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes you feel younger and with a full head of hair.  </li>
      <li>Why pay more when you get almost twice the product for nearly half the price.</li>
      <li>I just sprinkled this onto the shiny areas, then used my normal hair products including leave-in conditioners , moisturizers and gels.  </li>
      <li>But when I sprinkled it on my dark brown (R5) hair for the first time, I noticed immediately that it had a distinct purplish tint.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product even when I turn completely gray!</li>
      <li>With a little practice and some hair spray, you are ready to hit the town with a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>everybody tells me everyday what beautiful thick hair i have.</li>
      <li>They conceal bald spots so well and so naturally.  </li>
      <li>and it looked completely natural.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for male or females (my wife uses it also) who have thinning hair or some balding.</li>
      <li>Try to avoid getting this product directly on your scalp, you can totally see that it&#x27;s there</li>
      <li>My hair is fine &amp; thin which means my scalp is visible.  </li>

<li> I have very thin, fine hair (male pattern baldness) and my scalp is no longer visible when I use it.  </li>

<li> I guess a few of the male stylists use the product there.</li>
<li> A little sprinkle goes a long way.  </li>

<li> Sadly, they are the most expensive but in this case you get what you pay for.</li>

<li> I like this product wish it were a little cheaper</li>
<li> Little do they know.</li>
<li> Little pricey for me.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very hard to aim, especially looking in the mirror.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t run down my face or neck when I sweat!  </li>
<li> you have thin hair, it makes a big difference!!</li>
<li> Takes two seconds - no fuss - no more bald spots.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard to blend.</li>
<li> I had a few spots where the hair was thin and my shiny scalp peeked thru.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve bought less expensive brand</li>
<li> I find it very difficult to get the powder in my bangs, which is where my problem is.</li>
<li> (sigh).&lt;br /&gt;It could be that I just happened to receive a bad batch, so I gave it two stars instead of one.</li>

    <li> Xfusion is probably the best keratin fibers that I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;m pretty much used them all.  Sadly, they are the most expensive but in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver!!!  I&#x27;ve been using Xfusion for almost 5 years!  My hair is fine &amp; thin which means my scalp is visible.  Xfusion makes my hair appear thicker!!!  My hairdresser even is amazed at how this product works!  I workout almost everyday &amp; sweat so much that I&#x27;m soaking wet... But good news is Xfusion stays put!  It doesn&#x27;t run down my face or neck when I sweat!  I&#x27;ve bought less expensive brand but the product didn&#x27;t hold up when I was sweating it out at the gym.  I was embarrassed cause my friend noticed &amp; asked what dark stuff coming down my neck...UGH!!!!!  I&#x27;m loyal to Xfusion!!!</li>
    <li> My husband used to use Kabooki and had been using this product now. He assures me that he will be a good looking bald guy, but until then he is a fan of this product:) I was referred this product by my stylist at Tribeca salon in Tampa, FL. I guess a few of the male stylists use the product there. I&#x27;m glad I found the product on amazon since it is very challenging to obtain it at a local salon in Savannah, GA.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of hiding those balding/thinning spots on your head. With a little practice and some hair spray, you are ready to hit the town with a full head of hair.</li>
    <li> Takes two seconds - no fuss - no more bald spots.  A little sprinkle goes a long way.  Lasts until the next washing.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It covers up the bald spots well.  Color matches perfectly.  Does not drip or make a mess</li>
    <li> I like this product wish it were a little cheaper&lt;br /&gt;This product really works.&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair, it makes a big difference!!</li>
    <li> I tried Xfusion and will not go back to Toppik. This seems to go on thicker and stays longer and it doesn&#x27;t wash away as easily.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  Doesn&#x27;t clump or &amp;#34;ball up&amp;#34; on your scalp like others. I only uncover half of the dispenser so I don&#x27;t get too much in one area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. it works great. everybody tells me everyday what beautiful thick hair i have. Little do they know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Toppik for years.  As I did a search to reorder it, I noticed Xfusion&#x27;s good reviews and that it was much cheaper than Toppik, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try instead.  But when I sprinkled it on my dark brown (R5) hair for the first time, I noticed immediately that it had a distinct purplish tint.  I returned it to Amazon immediately and ordered the Toppik instead (sigh).&lt;br /&gt;It could be that I just happened to receive a bad batch, so I gave it two stars instead of one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d be lost without this product!</li>
    <li> Works great on african american natural hair.  I had a few spots where the hair was thin and my shiny scalp peeked thru.  I just sprinkled this onto the shiny areas, then used my normal hair products including leave-in conditioners , moisturizers and gels.  No clumping or dripping and it looked completely natural.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I have very thin, fine hair (male pattern baldness) and my scalp is no longer visible when I use it.  I set it with hair spray and even sweating bullets at the gym, it doesn&#x27;t come off.  Has helped my self-confidence so much!</li>
    <li> This is a powder that comes out of a salt shaker type container. I find it very difficult to get the powder in my bangs, which is where my problem is. It&#x27;s very hard to aim, especially looking in the mirror. Try to avoid getting this product directly on your scalp, you can totally see that it&#x27;s there and it&#x27;s hard to blend. I have been through rain and sweat with no issues. Little pricey for me. Worth the price?? Still deciding.</li>
    <li> IF IT WEREN&#x27;T FOR XFUSION, I WOULD HAVE BALD SPOTS ALL OVER MY HEAD.  AFTER MY HAIR GREW BACK FROM CHEMOTHRAPY IT WAS FINE FOR AWHILE.  AND THEN ABOUT 6 MONTHS LATER, IT STARTED TO FALL OUT AGAIN.  SO BETWEEN VITAMINS AND XFUSION, I NOW LOOK LIKE I HAVE A FULL HEAD OF HAIR.  THANK GOODNESS</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. Now you see it now you don&#x27;t..!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Keratin Hair Fibres!  They conceal bald spots so well and so naturally.  The product is a bit pricey, but does what it says it will do.  I highly recommend this product for male or females (my wife uses it also) who have thinning hair or some balding. Makes you feel younger and with a full head of hair.  Great product.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product even when I turn completely gray!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since undergoing treatment for breast cancer. This helps me to conceal my thinner hair.</li>
    <li> Why pay more when you get almost twice the product for nearly half the price. It came super fast and keratin hair fibres is as good as any of the leading products. Would definitely buy again</li>
