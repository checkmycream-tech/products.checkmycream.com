      <li>I read tons of reviews and they all said this was the best.</li>

      <li>It works great, it restores the vibrancy and color.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell &amp; great conditioner too!  </li>
      <li>This product is very effective in depositing color.  </li>
      <li>Also, it is a very nice conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Conditioner is good.</li>
      <li>but it was kind of bright orange.</li>
      <li>I love this product,however great service this item came to me with cracks in the bottle</li>
      <li>I LOVE this color depositing conditioner!  </li>
      <li>I love them!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner, as I am a redhead.</li>
      <li>and I am glad that I did.</li>
      <li>then you will love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I found this product when searching this Amazon site, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Not so sure about this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I sure hope Ted Gibson hasn&#x27;t discontinued this product.</li>
      <li>Part of my hair is dyed a rich sort of auburn color (which I love!)</li>
      <li>This product extends the need to color my hair - blends the roots of my hair nicely plus it give me a great red color.  </li>
      <li>It has a very light scent and rinses cleanly without leaving any residue-or color!-on my scalp.</li>
      <li>so you need a color depositing shampoo or conditioner to keep the color looking rich and bright until your next salon trip.</li>
      <li>Because this has a nice warm copper color, it really keeps my red longer and more natural</li>
      <li>It has a lot of pigment, so much in fact that it actually leaves some dye on my hands for a couple of hours, but the upside is that the color is so amazing that many people have commented on my hair ever since I started using</li>
      <li>The color is so intense; it can leave a tinge on your hands but it washes off easily.  </li>
      <li>I even cut the conditioner with an intense mask or conditioner most of the time as my hair is kind of dry and</li>
      <li>This is the best color depositing conditioner I have used, Others have left my hair almost pink.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This will not substitute for trip to the salon, but it makes me feel better about waiting another couple of weeks before a professional refresher.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It deposits a nice color that will last for about a week.</li>
      <li>May help keep color in for freshly dyed hair.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something to just brighten a bit, this is not the right one.  </li>
      <li>oh and it doesnt want to wash right out..</li>
      <li>However, this is the only product that may be a suitable replacement:  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down so works great as a regular conditioning product in addition to color</li>
      <li>I have used pureology kit for red hair - gave me similar color which was very nice but twice the price.</li>
      <li>This product put the red back in my hair very nicely.  </li>
      <li>I tried the Ted Gibson Copper Shampoo alone first but feel as though it did not make a noticeable difference.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different color depositing shampoos and conditioners over the years, but now I&#x27;m sold on the Ted Gibson one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible but was caught off guard from strawberry blonde to medium</li>
      <li>I have been using the Ted Gibson Individual Color shampoo and conditioner in copper for more than 2 years</li>
      <li>My hair dresser told me if I dyed my hair red two times in a row it wouldn&#x27;t fade as fast and it would look a lot better.</li>
      <li>I found this (and the shampoo) and decided to give it a try because I had my hair colored reddish brown and the red washed out very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I just kept extra liners from the dollar store and changed them often and used strong bleach on the tub.  </li>
      <li>I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>- otherwise it can get too intense color for me.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy the conditoner with it so that may have been the problem, but my hair faded really fast.</li>
      <li>about once a week I use the copper conditioner, leaving it on 5 minutes so it can really coat my hair.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really like the packaging</li>
      <li>It detangles really well,</li>
      <li>but reds fade so fast when you dye your hair</li>
      <li>I used color shampoos which helped, but changed the red color I originally had.  </li>
      <li>I use it every other (or even more)  time I shampoo</li>
      <li>I left this conditioner on for a full five minutes and scrubbed my hands with sugar scrub to remove the orange stains while I waited.</li>
      <li>I wish the bottle were easier to squeese especially when it starts to empty but the color in this bottle is magic and totally worth it.  </li>
      <li>Everyone knows that reds fade quickly and mine is no different.</li>
      <li>This conditioner requires only a small amount, and it foams up a little, but it detangles perfectly.  </li>
      <li>After rinsing and blow drying it was immediately apparent that my copper color was much more vibrant and my roots slightly less</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
      <li>Shiny, soft, and under control!</li>
      <li>first time i tried it, i simply poured conditioner in my hand and into my hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a natural redhead whose hair has faded, so I get it colored.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;As far as functioning as a conditioner I feel neutral.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally medium brown and is salon died to Karen Gillan sort of copper.</li>
      <li>not pleased at all - hoping it will shampoo out quickly!</li>
      <li>I actually stopped coloring my hair red because it fades so fast.  </li>
      <li>since the color clearly was not distributed evenly - the 2nd time, i combed it thru.  </li>
      <li>They give the hair the nuance that natural red hair has.  </li>
      <li>A little expensive, but a great alternative for the discontinued L&#x27;oreal Artec line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>and it left a subtle clean scent.</li>
      <li>I did notice that it faded less fast/deposited color in my hair pretty evenly as long as I always used this (as opposed to a regular shampoo).</li>
      <li>: I really needed a deep conditioning, so I mixed this with a little Moroccan Oil Repairing Conditioner and left it in for 20 minutes with a shower cap...</li>

<li> It&#x27;s worth the money, as it won&#x27;t turn your expensive copper red dye job hot pink like the others on the market.</li>

<li> I am disappointed that the last time I tried to purchase this product I was unable to fine it anywhere on the web.</li>
<li> I just didn&#x27;t like the color it turned my hair and after a few uses it would really build up and look very fake.</li>
<li> and I usually have to use an additional conditioner so that I can get the knots out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This product stained my skin orange, the shower curtain, the shower walls and it deposited color in my hair in very uneven orange blotches.  </li>
<li> Red/copper colored hair is hard to keep from fading.  </li>
<li> conditioner is extremely thick.  </li>
<li> Too thick to get out of bottle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using the Ted Gibson Individual Color shampoo and conditioner in copper for more than 2 years and I&#x27;m happy with the results I get on my hair. Part of my hair is dyed a rich sort of auburn color (which I love!) but reds fade so fast when you dye your hair so you need a color depositing shampoo or conditioner to keep the color looking rich and bright until your next salon trip. I have tried many different color depositing shampoos and conditioners over the years, but now I&#x27;m sold on the Ted Gibson one. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but I don&#x27;t really like the packaging - it&#x27;s hard for me get enough conditioner out unless I take the whole cap off of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I found this product when searching this Amazon site, and I love it.  I wanted a product that would deposit color, in between dying my hair, and this is the product that I was searching for. It has a lot of pigment, so much in fact that it actually leaves some dye on my hands for a couple of hours, but the upside is that the color is so amazing that many people have commented on my hair ever since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely hate the bottle that it comes in because it makes it harder to get the product out. Hopefully they will change the bottle someday as per consumer request.</li>
    <li> Tried this on faded coppery semi permanent hair with a few gray hairs and did deposit color but it was kind of bright orange. May help keep color in for freshly dyed hair. Aveeda madder root does same thing at half the cost.</li>
    <li> I found this (and the shampoo) and decided to give it a try because I had my hair colored reddish brown and the red washed out very quickly.  This product put the red back in my hair very nicely.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This works great. I have dyed strawberry-blonde hair (Aveda) and using this helps extend the life of the color (I use the shampoo and conditioner both).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is extremely thick.  I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down so works great as a regular conditioning product in addition to color preservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know this does turn the palm of your hands red.  After finishing up showering though it&#x27;s gone so don&#x27;t be alarmed...doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin like a tanning lotion does even though it may look like it initially!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to other redheads to extend the life of your color.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color depositing conditioner!  The color is so intense; it can leave a tinge on your hands but it washes off easily.  Thankfully it leave a tinge on my hair that doesn&#x27;t wash out! I even cut the conditioner with an intense mask or conditioner most of the time as my hair is kind of dry and the color still does it&#x27;s job.  When I go to the salon every four weeks, I always get compliments on how well my color holds up even from the stylists.  Anyone with red knows how hard it is to maintain.  This does the trick.  I wish the bottle were easier to squeese especially when it starts to empty but the color in this bottle is magic and totally worth it.  If this even goes off the market, I will cry.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It works great, it restores the vibrancy and color.  Remember to wear gloves because your hands will stain!</li>
    <li> Conditioner is good. It does add color to your hair. Package is awful. Too thick to get out of bottle. Bottle cracked. This is die so I&#x27;m worried about it staining.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item believing it would help maintain the red color in my hair. it does deposit red pigment - the problem is it does NOT distribute this color evenly. first time i tried it, i simply poured conditioner in my hand and into my hair.  since the color clearly was not distributed evenly - the 2nd time, i combed it thru.  terrible - my husband said i looked like those young girls that put strange colorings in their hair.  not pleased at all - hoping it will shampoo out quickly!</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner! I followed the directions on the bottle and combed it through my hair after shampooing, but I left it on a bit longer. It detangles really well, left my hair soft and shiny, and really refreshed the red tones in my hair (which can be very time-consuming and expensive when you dye your hair red!). It has a very light scent and rinses cleanly without leaving any residue-or color!-on my scalp. A little expensive, but a great alternative for the discontinued L&#x27;oreal Artec line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I really needed a deep conditioning, so I mixed this with a little Moroccan Oil Repairing Conditioner and left it in for 20 minutes with a shower cap...WOW! Shiny, soft, and under control!</li>
    <li> Not so sure about this shampoo. I read tons of reviews and they all said this was the best. I didn&#x27;t buy the conditoner with it so that may have been the problem, but my hair faded really fast. I did notice that it faded less fast/deposited color in my hair pretty evenly as long as I always used this (as opposed to a regular shampoo). I am a dyed blonde who went all red. My hair dresser told me if I dyed my hair red two times in a row it wouldn&#x27;t fade as fast and it would look a lot better. Instead, I got annoyed and went back to blonde. I wish this would have worked out.</li>
    <li> I tried the Ted Gibson Copper Shampoo alone first but feel as though it did not make a noticeable difference. After reading reviews I decided to give the conditioner a try and I am glad that I did. My hair is naturally medium brown and is salon died to Karen Gillan sort of copper. Everyone knows that reds fade quickly and mine is no different. About 3.5 weeks after my trip to the salon, my copper was very dull and my roots were an ugly brown stripe against my scalp. I left this conditioner on for a full five minutes and scrubbed my hands with sugar scrub to remove the orange stains while I waited. After rinsing and blow drying it was immediately apparent that my copper color was much more vibrant and my roots slightly less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not substitute for trip to the salon, but it makes me feel better about waiting another couple of weeks before a professional refresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as functioning as a conditioner I feel neutral. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel particularly nourished but it isn&#x27;t dried out either and it left a subtle clean scent.</li>
    <li> I have tried every type of color-depositing shampoo and conditioner on the market.  The very best was Artec/Loreal Colorist Collection, which is now discontinued.  However, this is the only product that may be a suitable replacement:  It does not make my hair pink, and doesn&#x27;t have the blue undertone that Aveda Madder root and some others have.  It is definitely a copper red.  Also, it is a very nice conditioner.  I normally need to use an entire handful of conditioner, lest my hair be unable to comb.  This conditioner requires only a small amount, and it foams up a little, but it detangles perfectly.  I would certainly recommend this product. It&#x27;s worth the money, as it won&#x27;t turn your expensive copper red dye job hot pink like the others on the market.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for copper red (orange/gold) then you will love this conditioner. It is all I use between color touch-ups. For those reviews complaining about orange....Hello? What color do you think copper is? It is orange-gold and a perfect orange-gold at that. I hope they never stop making it. I try to stock up just in case.  If you are looking for burgundy type red, this is NOT it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice! Red/copper colored hair is hard to keep from fading.  This product extends the need to color my hair - blends the roots of my hair nicely plus it give me a great red color.  I use it every other (or even more)  time I shampoo - otherwise it can get too intense color for me.  Nice smell &amp; great conditioner too!  I have used pureology kit for red hair - gave me similar color which was very nice but twice the price.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective in depositing color.  If you are looking for something to just brighten a bit, this is not the right one.  It will stain your hands and you must wear gloves or end up with yellow fingernails and orange knuckles.  I like what it does for my color but my hair is not soft after I use it and I usually have to use an additional conditioner so that I can get the knots out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part about the product is the packaging.  After having used about 1/3 of the product it becomes very difficult to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It deposits a nice color that will last for about a week.</li>
    <li> I have never had a color conditioner that made my hair so dark...It&#x27;s not terrible but was caught off guard from strawberry blonde to medium auburn...oh and it doesnt want to wash right out..takes a few weeks ..kudos on staying power</li>
    <li> I love this product,however great service this item came to me with cracks in the bottle and i was hoping for a replacement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using both the Ted Gibson copper shampoo and conditioner, and like them both a lot.  They are color-depositing, so you must be careful to distribute them evenly and rinse thoroughly so they don&#x27;t streak or leave color on towels.  But, boy, what they do!  I&#x27;m a natural redhead whose hair has faded, so I get it colored.  Red dye fades.  This shampoo and conditioner add a shimmer, a little color, and a lot of zip.  Sometimes I just use the copper shampoo (if I&#x27;m in a hurry) and about once a week I use the copper conditioner, leaving it on 5 minutes so it can really coat my hair.  They give the hair the nuance that natural red hair has.  I love them!</li>
    <li> I actually stopped coloring my hair red because it fades so fast.  I used color shampoos which helped, but changed the red color I originally had.  The red would stain the tub and shower liner, as well.  Obviously it is dye so I expected that.  I just kept extra liners from the dollar store and changed them often and used strong bleach on the tub.  I just didn&#x27;t like the color it turned my hair and after a few uses it would really build up and look very fake.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, as I am a redhead. I am disappointed that the last time I tried to purchase this product I was unable to fine it anywhere on the web. I sure hope Ted Gibson hasn&#x27;t discontinued this product. REDHEADS are people too.!</li>
    <li> This is the best color depositing conditioner I have used, Others have left my hair almost pink. Because this has a nice warm copper color, it really keeps my red longer and more natural</li>
    <li> This product stained my skin orange, the shower curtain, the shower walls and it deposited color in my hair in very uneven orange blotches.  I returned it for my money back.  Would not recommend.</li>
