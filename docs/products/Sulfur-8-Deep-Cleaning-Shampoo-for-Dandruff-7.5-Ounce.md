    <li> love the shampoo. very clean feeling .</li>
    <li> great shampoo for dandruff, it it the only one that has worked for me</li>
    <li> Works well to eliminate stubborn dandruff. Despite the name and active ingredient, has a pleasant smell. Be aware it will strip your hair not only of build up of product but also hair color. Not all at once, but your color will not last very long when you are using this product.</li>
    <li> Twice daily shampoo scalp&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo&#x27;re clean wonderful</li>
    <li> It seemed watered down</li>
    <li> I really like the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair clean, has reduced my breakage, gives my hair a healthy shine what more can I ask for?</li>
    <li> Works as promised, thanks!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this shampoo for 15 years.  Its all he uses on his hair, and its so soft.  A little goes a long way.  He washes his hair every morning, and one bottle lasts 2 months.</li>
    <li> Excellent, did the job</li>
    <li> It does not have any sulfur in it, as far as I can tell. It does have sodium laurel sulfate and other ingredients. I could be wrong, but I don&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We needed the sulfur specifically, so very disappointed. We are using JASON&#x27;s Medicated Dandruff Shampoo with Micronized sulfur and salicylic acid which works really well for scalp eczema. It also does not have all the chemical preservatives listed below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients for Sulfur 8 Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Triclosan - 0.2 % (Antibacterial agent found in hand soaps and Dial body wash)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Water, (water of course), TEA-Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate , Lauramide DEA (these three are preservatives, detergents, and emulsifiers), Cocoamphoacetate (coconut oil derived surfacent) , Fragrance, Disodium EDTA (another preservative to prevent oxygen from spoiling the product) , Sodium Chloride (Salt), Yellow 6, Blue 1</li>
    <li> Great deal fast shipping thanks you</li>
    <li> This is great for oily hair. My son uses this all the time for very oily hair and helps with the acne that is brought on by the oily hair.</li>
    <li> seems to be helping with my scalp.. time will tell as it says to only use 2x per week.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, I no longer have dandruff this works for me and is not harsh on the hair</li>
    <li> Great product.makes my hair look good and relieves scalp of scaling in the first week.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product people remember that worked so well.  I found a vintage bottle of sulfur 8 on-line (dated maybe 60&#x27;s/ 70&#x27;s) and the active ingredient at that time was Bithionol.  This product to me is no longer effective.</li>
    <li> Looking for a good sulfur shampoo?  Keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;My Dr recommended sulfur shampoo for my skin problem. Sulfur8 does not list sulfur as an ingredient!!</li>
