      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the woman in the picture is wearing 9 pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>This works best for relaxed black hair that resembles coarse straight extensions.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s 3or 5$ higher.</li>
      <li>The hair was a good texture considering it&#x27;s african american hair.</li>

      <li>The hair is brown, but it&#x27;s much lighter than the picture.</li>
      <li>Your product is made very well.</li>

      <li>Only sheds about 10 strands which is pretty reasonable.</li>
      <li>Not a very good product it sheds a lot and breaks off very easily</li>
      <li>I live about 30 minutes from the shipping unit and with Prime</li>

      <li>And it feels soft and look real.it blend in well with my hair relaxed it.</li>
      <li>I took one by accident after a busy day,and it didn&#x27;t demolished it.</li>
      <li>Other than that the extensions were very think and soft and matched my natural hair color.</li>
      <li>The texture was spot on and the color actually blended well in my natural color.</li>
      <li>After washing and blow drying it, it feels like 4C black relaxed hair that&#x27;s been blowdried, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Not sure it is real ,because It couldn&#x27;t straightened on high volume,  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would not recommend it. Poor quality</li>
    <li> The hair wasn&#x27;t as pictured i.e. it was significantly lighter and was a color 4 I believe. I needed two packets to get decent results, but they weren&#x27;t great. I may try in a shorter length, and try to get the right color. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> The color is not the exactly the same as in the photo</li>
    <li> I got this and I was expecting it took look like it did in the picture and it didn&#x27;t. The color was a very light brown and was expecting a darker color. Other than that the extensions were very think and soft and matched my natural hair color. I just use them as highlights in the back of my head because they don&#x27;t match</li>
    <li> oh my goodness. it looks terrible</li>
    <li> The color blended well with my hair color.It&#x27;s a comfortable fit and stays in well. It does not shed and is easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> Cheap beauty supply store hair. Smells just like the human hair blend that&#x27;s sold in the beauty supply store. Cheap and not worth it in my opinion. Very very thin</li>
    <li> The texture was spot on and the color actually blended well in my natural color. I had never tried extensions before and I have to say this was a great first experience. They are very easy to put in and remove. Since it 100% human hair it was very nice, not synthetic feeling. After washing and drying it did shed a bit but after a couple washes and styles it stopped. I usually straiten my hair to wear these but I can also curl my hair and the extensions and it works wonderfully I am so lucky that I got this for free to be able to test it out and give my opinion. I plan on getting a lot more extensions to try out now that I know a company I can trust.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Thank you</li>
    <li> It is the perfect color and everything! Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised but hair was far from what I expected. So disappointed with quality. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The hair is cheap, it looked awful!! I am not sure what the other reviews were talking about but the pack the I recieved was not good!</li>
    <li> This hair isn&#x27;t bad. I read the reviews saying that the hair was the wrong color and that&#x27;s true. The hair is brown, but it&#x27;s much lighter than the picture. It&#x27;s more of an auburn brown. I had to by darkest brown hair dye so it would match my hair color, and since we&#x27;re on the topic, the hair takes really well to hair dye. I recommend two boxes of dye; one box is fine, but it leaves more of an ombre effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture before washing feels nice. It&#x27;s silky but not so silky that it won&#x27;t match my hair (NOTE: this is not the same silky texture after getting your hair relaxed. Scroll down to read updated review). After washing and blow drying it, it feels like 4C black relaxed hair that&#x27;s been blowdried, which is exactly what I wanted. However, I&#x27;m skeptical of this being 100% human hair. I noticed some thick strands of hair that felt synthetic like Marley extensions. You will also notice strands of thread in the hair, but that can be pulled out easily. I wish there was a 9 piece option because 7 pieces was not enough (which is why I ordered two packs). I&#x27;m pretty sure the woman in the picture is wearing 9 pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair takes heat very well. I recommend using heat protectant though just so i won&#x27;t look too fried. It was never silky straight when I straightened it, but that&#x27;s fine because I hate extensions that look drastically different than my hair when straightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what delivery was like outside of California. I live about 30 minutes from the shipping unit and with Prime, I got my extensions in two days, so I didn&#x27;t have to wait too long. Overall, this is good hair for the price and maintenance. This works best for relaxed black hair that resembles coarse straight extensions. I enjoy them very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these extensions for nearly a month and so far it&#x27;s been good. I do have some concerns. After three weeks, I washed the extensions for the first time noticed that the quality wasn&#x27;t exactly the same. Actually, overtime I noticed that it was starting to resist a flat iron and a blow dryer. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I rarely needed to use on the extensions; just take them out brush them, put a little sheen on it and out them back in their original package overnight, and when I did use heat, I used a heat protectant. But after washing and conditioning them twice, I noticed that they were still frizzy and seemed a little fried especially on the ends. I also got another relaxer for my own hair and noticed that the textures were slightly different; my real hair was silky and soft and the extensions were frizzy and kept getting tangled. As for conditioning, I used a reconstructing conditioner and coconut oil and there was very little change in the texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t given up on this brand. What I&#x27;ll probably do is order two more packs every time I get a relaxer. The hair still matches my real hair up until I get it relaxed, so it&#x27;s just a matter of planning.

    <li> These seem like good hair extensions. I got them for a friend who wanted realistic hair that also looked African-American as well. It came quickly, was just the right color, and seems to be durable enough to use. I&#x27;m not an expert on hair extensions, but it apparently this is a great price for 7 pieces of extensions.</li>
    <li> The hair was a good texture considering it&#x27;s african american hair. The hair was not the color displayed. Becuase my&lt;br /&gt;Hair is a dark brown like the models. But it was WAY ligher. But other than that it was beautiful and when you dye it. Only sheds about 10 strands which is pretty reasonable.</li>
    <li> The price is very reasonable, and the quality is great! It matches the texture of my hair but the only downside is that it was the wrong color. I have a deep dark brown hair color and I was expecting the extensions to match my hair because the picture made it seem as if that was the color. The color was actually a very light brown, but because it&#x27;s 100% human hair, I decided to get them dyed to match my natural hair color at a local hair salon and they work great! They blend perfectly now and the clips are really tight and secure!</li>
    <li> I love this hair.  My boyfriend touched it, and said to me Oh Is it real?  It&#x27;s really soft! and It&#x27;s the quickest way to get mid length for short girls hair. It&#x27;s actually longer then I aspected. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6 and It&#x27;s down to my breast area. not to long or to short. to be honest when i was buying didn&#x27;t think would of been that great cause of the prize. I just  had a bad haircut like 3 months ago, still haven&#x27;t been able to grow it back, I been taking a pill to grow my hair back until then this going to be on the go hair and if you&#x27;re wondering Yes you can take a nap with it. I took one by accident after a busy day,and it didn&#x27;t demolished it. So that tell you It&#x27;s sturdy enough. Plus It&#x27;s a Quick hair on the go as we all know.  And this hair I had for one month and It&#x27;s still great. So I wanted to be fuller so I bought two. One do Fine.   I washed and moisturize the hair, and straightened it. It&#x27;s a beautiful hair And it feels soft and look real.it blend in well with my hair relaxed it. i get tons of compliments! Not sure it is real ,because It couldn&#x27;t straightened on high volume,  but on low it was perfectly Fine. All in all I would invest and give it a try. It&#x27;s the least expensive for the quality.  and Amazon Stop changing the prize. Everything It&#x27;s 3or 5$ higher.</li>
    <li> Not a very good product it sheds a lot and breaks off very easily</li>
    <li> Cheap is definatey the quality of the hair. I&#x27;m not sure why it has such high rating because it sheds and it&#x27;s not thick AT ALL! It&#x27;s not human hair and not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I will be honest. I sent horrible feedback for this item because I did not opened the packaged completely. I thought I received the wrong order, however once I took the time to open the package it is exactly what I ordered! I apologize sincerely to abHair.  Your product is made very well. The clips are very secure and the hair feels really nice.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the clip-in tracks.  It meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love them , they come in handy , easy to style and soft 😍😍</li>
    <li> My daughter, who is from Ethiopia bought these extensions and she&#x27;s worn them daily since.  They blend in perfectly with her hair.  She&#x27;s been very happy.</li>
    <li> I liked this product.I found it easy to use.The color blended well with my hair color.It holds a curl well.Please do not change this color. The one draw back the product does shed.I&#x27;d like to see that improved.</li>
