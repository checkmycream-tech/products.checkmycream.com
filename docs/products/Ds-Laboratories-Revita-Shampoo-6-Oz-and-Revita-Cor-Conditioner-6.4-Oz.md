      <li>I recommend this to anyone with fine, thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Lathers really well, nice scent</li>
      <li>my hair doesn&#x27;t fall as much is healthier, LOVE IT</li>

      <li>and I received it quickly.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff has grown my hair 25% faster then normal.</li>
      <li>none with comparable success.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice product at a great price.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Came across this product 6 years ago. Had to get perms 2&#x27;x a year to get volume. Picked up a bottle at my hairdressers. Used it as directed and in less than 6 months noticed my hair was &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;. I now use it to slow down my hair from falling out. So pleased with product recommend &amp; purchased some for my sister whose hair was thinning so badly. She has noticed new hair growth over the last 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is the best Shampoo and conditioner I ever have I love the DS Laboratories  products.</li>
    <li> Lathers really well, nice scent</li>
    <li> love the shampoo I can already see the difference.</li>
    <li> This product works for me.  If nothing else my hair feels thicker.  I used this product before but the shop I bought it from closed, I was excited to find it on Amazkn.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo and conditioner I ever had, and the service is amazing  LOVE IT!! you get it super fast! I always going to buy this item ! my hair doesn&#x27;t fall as much is healthier, LOVE IT</li>
    <li> It works. You do have to use it consistently and after you stop, you can tell the difference.</li>
    <li> really good stuff, I like it!!!!</li>
    <li> Brought this for my brother; can&#x27;t really tell the results coz he&#x27;s only been using it for 2 weeks; takes a little bit more time in the shower since u have to follow the recommendation; need do hair, soak and wash body and rinse to avoid wasting water</li>
    <li> Could not believe the thickness I get. I have very thin hair and this just made a world of difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using Revita Shampoo and Conditioner for over a year.  From the very beginning of usage, I noticed that I was not losing as much hair.  I have tried Nioxin, as well as Avalon and Jason products...none with comparable success.  There is a commitment required (leave first application of shampoo on head 1-2 minutes while massaging scalp; then, leave second application on for 3-5 min; then, leave conditioner on for 1-2 minutes).  Initially, this was a challenge for me, but seeing excellent results gave me the initiative to stay committed.  I recommend this to anyone with fine, thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Having just finished chemo my beautician found me this in December.  My hair is coming back in thick and strong.  No medicinal smell and the shampoo works up a nice lather.  The conditioner is a bit thick so I use a little then put a small amount of water in the bottle and shake it up so I can more easily squeeze the conditioner out.  I like the way my hair feels after I get  through using these 2 products.</li>
    <li> Product was great and I received it quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month and have seen no results.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff has grown my hair 25% faster then normal. People compliment on how long my hair is getting.</li>
    <li> Great Product, long showers which is not good if you take showers alone</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;m shocked! I placed my ordered and not only received it quickly, but got a free upgrade from BeautyAnd to the super large sized product. This is going to last me months! Something about being their 1 Millionth Order! That&#x27;s a lot orders (not all from me obviously). Now that&#x27;s outstanding customer relations. No complaints here, always quick shipping from BeautyAnd and Amazon and great product offerings. As for Revita and DS Labs products - there is no comparison, they produce high quality formulation regrowth shampoo and conditioner that actually works. In my case I use it to keep what I have and it seems to prevent my hair from falling out as much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for about two year now. They work great and this price is amazing compared to buying it in a salon. What some people might not know is that you need to use this with Spectral DNS 4oz. with double spray. No one sells it on here and you need to order it from DS Laboratories or find it for $50.00 at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to use the shampoo, conditioner and the Spectral DNS spray to achieve full thicker hair results. The shampoo and conditioner alone work only so so.</li>
    <li> Product is goof.  And It could be better if the delivery process is more faster.</li>
    <li> the product actually works. i still loose some hair after shampooing but there is a lot of new hair growing in which is a first in a while. my only negative is that last time i bought the same pack for $28 AND THIS ONE WAS $55</li>
    <li> Shampoo was half full when arrived. Beware of this. Product showed no results of hair grow.</li>
    <li> I have not seen dramatic growth but I have seen and notice less hair falling out</li>
