      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do a lot for moisture, but it smells great!</li>
      <li>I thought I would love this product b/c I&#x27;ve used Moroccan Oil products before and liked them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t love the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I use the Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment, and I really love it, and so when my hair stylist told me I should try the shampoo and conditioner, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  </li>
      <li>My hair became more dryer and uncontrollable with this perm.  </li>
      <li>I suppose we have to pay more for quality.</li>
      <li>Love the silkyness and shine.  </li>
      <li>Love this products.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product for people who frequently process their hair.</li>
      <li>You have to really do the rinse and repeat step though, to get a good lather going.  </li>
      <li>The Intense Curl Cream by Moroccanoil is MUST for women who have a perm!!!</li>
      <li>I have tested the product, and I was incorrect in my original assumption.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricy, but worth it!</li>
      <li>My apologies to the seller for my original review.  </li>
      <li>Clean, fresh with a touch of vanilla.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo has made my hair feel healthy again by using the natural oils my hair needs!  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and the soft touch my hair gets when I use this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Hoping for same kind of \\&quot;special\\&quot; as the oil.</li>
      <li>I was wondering why my hair was not coming out good, and looking limp, and never really put it together that the shampoo was to blame, because the moroccanoil shampoo is so good.  </li>
      <li>Originally I thought the product was a knock off (because the bottle was different from what I had purchased elsewhere) and not the original product.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately it is also the best shampoo I have ever had--and I&#x27;m 65.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing, like all of the other Moroccan Oil products.  </li>
      <li>My hair is curly with medium sized ringlets, but kind of fine and sort of thin</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s may a really visable difference on my over-processed blond hair.  </li>
      <li>I have colored treated hair, and this product allows me to go much longer betweeen treatments.  </li>
      <li>There are other store bought non-sulfate shampoos that perform better.</li>
      <li>Very little needed and even grey frizzy hair looks and feels great.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I tried many other products but none of these could come close to the results I achieved with Moroccanoil!!!</li>
      <li>Not a bad shampoo just not worth the money.</li>
      <li>and it was totally different, smelled different too, and guess what my hair came out soft and silky again!  </li>
      <li>and since I live in Colorado, extremely dry.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, it has been about 2 or 3 weeks since I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a major different.  </li>

<li> Very disappointing considering how well the oil works.</li>

    <li> I bought this shampoo, conditioner and hydrating treatment and it&#x27;s may a really visable difference on my over-processed blond hair.  The oil is great too.  The vendor also shipped it pronto</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil Repair Shampoo and Conditioner is an excellent product for hair that has been chemically treated by perms and/or colorings. I received a perm this past July:  I have not had a perm in twenty three years. My hair became more dryer and uncontrollable with this perm.  I tried many other products but none of these could come close to the results I achieved with Moroccanoil!!! The Intense Curl Cream by Moroccanoil is MUST for women who have a perm!!! Outstanding product for MY hair!!!!</li>
    <li> I am using Moroccan Oil shampoo and cream rince and it is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I use the Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment, and I really love it, and so when my hair stylist told me I should try the shampoo and conditioner, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  My hair is curly with medium sized ringlets, but kind of fine and sort of thin and since I live in Colorado, extremely dry.  I have struggled with keeping my hair looking moisturized since I moved here.      The shampoo is pretty good.  It smells amazing, like all of the other Moroccan Oil products.  I also noticed an immediate different in how my hair felt while I was still in the shower.  Other shampoos have left my hair desperate for conditioner, very wiry and dry feeling while still in the shower.  It almost feels like you don&#x27;t need to condition your hair after using the shampoo (almost, I still need to condition).  You have to really do the rinse and repeat step though, to get a good lather going.  Anyway, it has been about 2 or 3 weeks since I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a major different.  My hair is a bit fluffier and less weighted down, but whether or not it is worth 20 bucks a bottle is still up in the air.</li>
    <li> Hoping for same kind of \\&quot;special\\&quot; as the oil. Not a bad shampoo just not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I thought I would love this product b/c I&#x27;ve used Moroccan Oil products before and liked them. Don&#x27;t love the shampoo.

I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again, and I&#x27;ll go back to using less expensive products that make my hair feel better!</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of this shampoo.    I didnt feel it added any moisture to my hair.  It felt like it dried my hair.  I got little results with this product and will not use again.    There are other store bought non-sulfate shampoos that perform better.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  I have thyroid disease and my hair is very dry and brittle.  This shampoo has made my hair feel healthy again by using the natural oils my hair needs!  Even my hair stylist has noticed!</li>
    <li> I have colored treated hair, and this product allows me to go much longer betweeen treatments.  Love this products.</li>
    <li> best shampoo ever, my hair shines and the smell is great, you should buy the oil as well to go together</li>
    <li> I use this every now and then.  My hair is very thin.  Doesn&#x27;t really do a lot for moisture, but it smells great!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair &amp; I was immediately addicted to the scent.  Clean, fresh with a touch of vanilla.  Love the silkyness and shine.  I&#x27;m definately hooked on this product line.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the soft touch my hair gets when I use this shampoo. When I use it with Moroccanoil maska and oil my hair gets more beautiful than it ever was!</li>
    <li> The product was amazing and cheaper than purchasing it from a salon. The bottle was packaged perfectly and arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  This is great for moisturizing your hair and I use it continuesly.  I might order it again.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Everything great as always.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve EVER used! It&#x27;s pricy, but worth it! My hair has never been silkier and the smell is AMAZE!!</li>
    <li> Really good product. My hair had shine and softness. I recommend. One of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after my daughter told me about it. It smells great and leaves my hair feeling amazing. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> If your hair needs moisture, this is NOT the product to buy. Very disappointing considering how well the oil works. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Originally I thought the product was a knock off (because the bottle was different from what I had purchased elsewhere) and not the original product.  I have tested the product, and I was incorrect in my original assumption.  The shampoo works wonderfully on my hair.  My apologies to the seller for my original review.  Thank you for your understanding.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people who frequently process their hair. I would like for it to be less expensive. I suppose we have to pay more for quality.</li>
    <li> Wow, is this expensive shampoo! Unfortunately it is also the best shampoo I have ever had--and I&#x27;m 65. Very little needed and even grey frizzy hair looks and feels great. If you can tolerate the price, I would recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this is a counterfeit!  Fake!  Back of my scalp is all dry and itchy, and I believe it is from using this FAKE Shampoo!! I was wondering why my hair was not coming out good, and looking limp, and never really put it together that the shampoo was to blame, because the moroccanoil shampoo is so good.  I stayed at my parents house and my mother had bought a bottle at a hair salon and I used it and it was totally different, smelled different too, and guess what my hair came out soft and silky again!  I went and purchased a bottle from a hair salon, and my hair is looking great again, and my scalp seems to be healing (i hope it does soon).  This company should be put out of business!!!!! Do not buy from them!</li>
