<ol>
      <li>Everything&#x27;s okay with my cosmelan pack!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product to use for melasma.</li>
      <li>but I was happy to know that they were selling here at amazon.</li>
      <li>Great product, Excelent Service</li>
      <li>Good product, work well</li>
      <li>Not as good as it used to be...</li>
      <li>After a week my skin looked amazing.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t afford the cost of laser, so in my opinion this is the next best choice with no downtime involved.</li>
      <li>IT DOES NOT CAUSE THE REDNESS AND PEELING THAT THE AUTHENTIC PRODUCT CAUSES.</li>
      <li>I am at 2.5 weeks now and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>I had better results than just using the Cosmelan 2 alone.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the results and recommend this product to any woman that have the same issues I had!</li>
      <li>Anyway I received my kit , fast delivery, good packaging and instructions.</li>
      <li>I made a huge effort to but this cosmelan kit .</li>
      <li>I post this as a warning to those that are thinking about using this to know initially it will do more harm than good.</li>
      <li>he told me, the original cosmelan is darker...</li>
      <li>( it&#x27;s pretty easy) by myself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been three weeks with mild peeling, but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference on the tone of my skin.</li>
      <li>the original one, gives me a red tinge feeling on the first two days, and i peeled good.</li>
      <li>in my case it&#x27;s pretty much d whole face!!!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted it to be!</li>
      <li>The mask provided a good start in tackling the brown spots and freckles on my face, due to lots of sun exposure living in California.</li>
      <li>When I first received this I could not wait to try it.</li>
      <li>I was warned by comments this could happen, but believed that for 400.00 dollars I was gonna get the real deal!  </li>
      <li>I like the product so much</li>
      <li>arrived fast and priced well</li>
      <li>highly recommended!</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT WAS THE REAL DEAL.</li>
      <li>VERY DISSAPPOINTED</li>
      <li>did half of what the formula used to do originally!</li>
      <li>I was very self conscious about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m supposed to reapply d mask next Thursday (21 days after first application) on spots that were not bleached but</li>
      <li>It is very harsh and can cause more problems on your face.</li>
      <li>I was expecting the old skin to fall and see new skin</li>
      <li>This peel off a little the skin, but it is fine when using a hydrating cream.</li>
      <li>It helped to get rid of my melasma as well as my adult acne.</li>

    <li> I made a huge effort to but this cosmelan kit . I have really bad melasma around my eyes and upper lip, also some acne marks. I&#x27;m 32 years old. Olive skin. I had seen this kit on eBay from the same seller yucatan beauty but I was happy to know that they were selling here at amazon. I have been an Amazon client for years and buy EVERYTHING here. I feel that amazon has my back . Anyway I received my kit , fast delivery, good packaging and instructions. I put on the mask on a Thursday, left it on my face 9 hrs, remove it, apply hydra k factor cream. The next day my skin was hurting a lot it turned brown on Saturday  and my skin was raw around my lips even bleeding. I patiently waited 4 days to see something different I mean anything! I was expecting the old skin to fall and see new skin But nothing happened! Same bad stains and about 400 dlls less !&lt;br /&gt; I am sooooo depressed!&lt;br /&gt;I am still using cosmelan 2. I&#x27;m supposed to reapply d mask next Thursday (21 days after first application) on spots that were not bleached but in my case it&#x27;s pretty much d whole face!!! I&#x27;m crying!</li>
    <li> I know you&#x27;re not supposed to, but I did this mask at home by myself.  I peeled like crazy and I looked awful for a week.  Then, I was flushed. I am at 2.5 weeks now and my skin has never looked better.  I had melasma from birth control and this is one thing I&#x27;ve found which actually takes it away without making me extremely susceptible to further discoloration. highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Everything&#x27;s okay with my cosmelan pack!!! It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for to treat my skin dark spots !!!</li>
    <li> I did cosmelan with a dermatologist before and the color is greenish. This one is orange brown.  Still gave it a try and so far no effect. Now i&#x27;m really wondering if this is a fake!</li>
    <li> Good product, work well</li>
    <li> Your product it&#x27;s a fake, I used yesterday for a 12 hours and then my face is same, it doesn&#x27;t works.  I have used cosmelan for 7 years and I know then the apply for 8 or 12 hours my face is totally red.  I need returned my money immediately.  I paid a lot of money for a fake product, I returned the product and your returned my money</li>
    <li> Mantiene las manchas bastante inhibidas.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A FAKE. IT DOES NOT CAUSE THE REDNESS AND PEELING THAT THE AUTHENTIC PRODUCT CAUSES. VERY DISSAPPOINTED THAT I TRUSTED THIS PRODUCT WAS THE REAL DEAL. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FAKE.</li>
    <li> I already using the products but it seems nothing change i can&#x27;t see any action with my melasma coz when i use cozmelan from Dermaclinic last year there&#x27;s an improvement or action immediately, maybe these products are fake</li>
    <li> This product was fake, I am a previous user of Cosmelan and the REAL COSMELAN works wonders. This product didn&#x27;t even sting, peel, or have any effect.. other than I took a day off to do 10hr mask and it was a waste of time and product* BECAUSE IT IS FAKE .. I was warned by comments this could happen, but believed that for 400.00 dollars I was gonna get the real deal!  WARNING BUY FROM YOUR DOCTOR*  waist of money, time, and all for dishonest people selling fake products..</li>
    <li> arrived fast and priced well</li>
    <li> i bought the product and only to find out its fake. i found it out because i should it to my doctor. he told me, the original cosmelan is darker... and i did see the difference when you use it. the original one, gives me a red tinge feeling on the first two days, and i peeled good. the pack that sold here, there&#x27;s only a micro peeling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been three weeks with mild peeling, but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference on the tone of my skin. My skin looks and feels very dry. The dark pigmentation areas haven&#x27;t improve. Nothing has changed except for the increase dryness. I really hope and pray that in a few more weeks I will see results, but as of right now, I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ok, not wonderful. Did help a bit. Stings a bunch.</li>
    <li> When I first received this I could not wait to try it. I applied the acetone oil cleanser with a cotton ball, and then I used a foundation brush and applied the cosmelan 1. It burned soooo bad. I just to wait a while but I immediately washed it off. I was burned under the chin, around my nose and cheeks. I would neva try anything like this again in life. I post this as a warning to those that are thinking about using this to know initially it will do more harm than good.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted it to be! Cosmelan is a terrific product for my melasma and I like that I can avoid the office markup on the product that I&#x27;ve come to trust.</li>
    <li> Not as good as it used to be...did half of what the formula used to do originally! A bit disappointed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product to use for melasma. Keep in mind to use this under a doctor orientation. This peel off a little the skin, but it is fine when using a hydrating cream.</li>
    <li> The Cosmelan pack is a professional only product and should be administered by a doctor or licensed aesthetician only!  No one should be doing this treatment on themselves. [[ASIN:B00AJMOGJK Cosmelan Pack by Mesoestetic]]</li>
    <li> This product does nothing!  Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.  It is very harsh and can cause more problems on your face.</li>
    <li> I like the product so much</li>
    <li> I recently did this treatment a few months ago and it did improve my melasma situation. I had better results than just using the Cosmelan 2 alone. The mask provided a good start in tackling the brown spots and freckles on my face, due to lots of sun exposure living in California. I can&#x27;t afford the cost of laser, so in my opinion this is the next best choice with no downtime involved. I am very happy with the results and recommend this product to any woman that have the same issues I had!</li>
    <li> Great product, Excelent Service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had melasma for 5 years, after my three pregnancies. It was taking over my face. I was very self conscious about it. I tried IPLs&lt;br /&gt;which made my melasma even worse . Then I decided to use Cosmelan. I did it at home ( it&#x27;s pretty easy) by myself. After a week my skin looked amazing. It helped to get rid of my melasma as well as my adult acne. This works!</li>
