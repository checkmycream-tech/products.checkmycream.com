<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Disclosure: I received complimentary products to facilitate this post. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t struggle with bad breath often, but there are times when my  mouth is a lot less fresh than I&#x27;d like it to be and I need to be in a meeting or working with students. It&#x27;s nice to have products like OraMD Breath from Trusted Health Products. Just one or two sprays of this naturally-sourced breath spray was enough to give me a fresh feeling. OraMD Breath has other advantages too - the ingredients are clinically proven to kill periodontal bacteria, and it contains no chemicals, sugar, alcohols, or additives (some of which can actually encourage bacteria growth, furthering a bad breath problem).</li>
    <li> This spray is fantastic! It is made only from pure, natural ingredients and it gives you FRESH minty breath.  Best part? It is killing the bacteria that cause bad breath, not just covering it up! LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
    <li> Nothing is worse than having bad breath at the most inopportune time! Have you ever been caught needing to go talk to someone after eating a meal with garlic, or onions in it? How about leave the house in too much of a hurry and forget to brush your teeth? I know when I am sick, no matter how many times I brush my teeth my mouth sometimes still feels and smells gross. Which is why I was super eager to try out OraMD- Breath by Trusted Health Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this tiny bottle of breath spray in the mail. oramd-breath-bott My first thought was that it was the perfect size to throw into my purse for on the go use for when I am out and unable to brush my teeth. This bottle has approx 60 sprays to it, which is plenty as it’s not to replace actually brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One spray completely eliminates embarrassing bad breath&lt;br /&gt;Kills the cause of bad breath on contact&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients clinically proven to kill periodontal bacteria&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a really fresh, clean feeling unlike anything you’ve experienced&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by Dentists Worldwide&lt;br /&gt;100% pure almond, spearmint, and peppermint oils – no chemicals, sugar, alcohol or additives of any kind&lt;br /&gt;One Year, 100% Money Back Guarantee – No Questions Asked&lt;br /&gt;I will be honest, when I got it I didn’t actually read the directions and sprayed into twice into my mouth and swallowed really fast. Needless to say I about died when I realized how strong it was! You are absolutely NOT supposed to swallow it, and you certainly do not need more than one spray to taste it. It almost burned so bad that my throat hurt, and again that wasn’t the products fault per say it was my lack of reading the directions first. OraMD Breath is actually recommended for consumers 13 years of age and older. It also warns that it can be strong-tasting and that within 2-7 days that it will subside and it wont be as strong-tasting.

    <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, and beats using mints or chewing gum.</li>
    <li> Essential oils are really wonderful because they are completely natural and pack so many healing and cleansing properties in just a drop or two. I love OraMD as a toothpaste alternative (which is made of the same ingredients), so I was really excited to try OraMD Breath from Trusted Health Products. It comes in a little spray bottle - .17 oz - and is the perfect size to fit in my purse. It&#x27;s about the same size as a lipstick, so I stick it in my purse right next to my lip products. I really like how small and travel-friendly it is. And even though it is such a small bottle, it doesn&#x27;t run out very quickly because just one spray freshens my breath like crazy and lasts a long time. Plus, I can refill it with my OraMD bottle if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a strong breath spray since it doesn&#x27;t have any sugar or other flavorings (which, by the way, can contribute to bacteria growth or tooth decay.) But it&#x27;s very effective by removing the bad breath instead of just masking it. At first, it was like a shock to my mouth since it is so strong, but after awhile I got used to it. Plus, I found that - at least at first - it helped to have some water handy to sip on afterward, just to tame the mint taste a bit. But man, does it do the job! I use this before meetings at work and any other close personal interactions. It is the perfect item to have along on a date too - small and discreet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to freshen your breath with a natural, effective product that is good for your mouth, choose OraMD Breath spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This breath spray works. For a long time! But the taste takes a while to get accustomed to - please use just one pump or you will hate it!</li>
    <li> The ingredients are what most of what draws me to OraMD products: they only contain natural, botanical oils of 100% Peppermint, Almond, and Spearmint. Because they are concentrated oils, the peppermint in certainly strong! But it does the trick. Sometime I have to have some water to flush a bit of the spray out if it&#x27;s too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This OraMD Breath spray appears to be the same as the OraMD Toothpaste and Mouthwash, however this bottle comes with a spray top versus a dropper top. The spray bottle allows you to spray a single &#x27;dose&#x27; into your mouth to freshen up your breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also you the OraMD Toothpaste and Mouthwash as a breath freshener, but I like that this OraMD Breath comes in a convenient travel/ purse size with a spray top. It fits perfectly in my small purse for on the go use and freshness. I plan to keep it at my desk in the office where I work to freshen my breath after my morning coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review and see pictures at maegal . blogspot . com&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Holy Toledo (I always wanted to say that, but never did a situation present itself in which this phrase fit perfectly)! Now I have. I would love to share the beauty of OraMD Breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here goes...I eat raw garlic each and every day - 365 days a year without fail. And so - this product was an excellent product for me to put to the test. OraMD Breath passed my &amp;#34;breathalyzer&amp;#34; with flying colors! I sprayed once in my mouth every morning for a month before I got in the pool to swim at early morning Masters. My lane mate was so happy! No one wants to smell garlic breath before the birds or up - or ever - for that matter, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent a bottle home with my swim coach and she tried it out on a sore throat for a day. She appreciated the fresh breath but I think she may have overdone it, because she had a bit of slight bout with heartburn. I have never had that problem with this product and I do believe the reason may because I only eat organic and live on a 90% plant based diet and so my body is used to many natural potent oils and such. Speaking of which, what makes OraMD Breath so powerful are the 3 ingredients which are a proprietary blend with special properties of almond oil, spearmint and peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to believe if my swim coach used this product prior to the sore throat; she may have never have gotten the sore throat because of the germ-killing properties.The manufacturer has stated OraMD Breath has:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients clinically proven to kill periodontal bacteria (which is the worst kind of oral bacteria) – in a recent University of Kentucky Clinical Study&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,  &amp;#34;The big difference between OraMD Breath and other products is not the fact that our ingredients also kill the germs that cause bad breath, but the fact that we do it with 100% pure and natural ingredients-no chemicals of any kind.&amp;#34; Impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend OraMD Breath to be used along with OraMD - The Mouth Doctor. Refreshing, healthy - the best dental regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Trusted Health Products.

    <li> NOTE: A part of this review previously appeared on Edge of Insanity. I did receive a sample but all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is small enough to fit into a pocket or handbag, which makes it easy for spraying on the go. The next thing that really stood out was the taste. If you&#x27;re expecting the taste of be like mouthwash, think again! The taste is very strong and kind of bitter. Okay- really bitter. It is kind of like a shock to the system the first time you use it. You might want to brace yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the bitterness went away the more I used it. Even the strong taste went away after a few uses. Once I got past the taste, I noticed that my breath didn&#x27;t smell as bad! Seriously! If I was worried about my breath just before speaking to someone, I would give it a quick spray, and I could tell that my breath was minty.</li>
    <li> Great product, worked like it should, tastes great, kept my breath fresh for hours!</li>
    <li> I love this breath spray it works so well and tastes so good . it will keep you breath fresh for hours and is so easy to use and take with you . I really love all the OraMD products for there ease of use and effectiveness</li>
    <li> OraMD Breath is made from a special blend of almond oil, spearmint oil and peppermint oil. These ingredients all do their part to attack and kill periodontal bacteria. Put them all together and you&#x27;ve got a powerhouse product that will get to the root of your bad breath issues and remedy them by eliminating the bacteria that is causing your bad breath in the first place. Personally, I&#x27;ve had great results with OraMD Breath! I love the amazing freshness that overtakes my mouth after just one spray. It is perfect for tucking into your purse or pocket when you are on the go, or even just for keeping in your home.</li>
    <li> Coffee breath? GONE! Garlic? GONE!  No amount of gum or little candy breath fresheners can even come close. I can&#x27;t believe how fast and how well this little spray works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly fresher breath than you can ever imagine.  One spray and you’ll feel like you&#x27;ve just brushed your teeth. Your breath will be fresh for hours!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 ml spray bottle equals 60 sprays!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OraMD’s mint oils gives your entire mouth that clean minty fresh tingle! OraMD’s formula helps to kill the bacteria that causes your bad breath. You can’t get any easier or better than that!</li>
    <li> I have been trying the Breath spray for a couple of weeks now - and I really like it. You just need a few squirts of it in your mouth. Or really only one full pump of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Breath spray is really refreshing and tastes great! I also love that it is 100% pure - with no chemicals!</li>
    <li> uncle harry&#x27;s organic breath freshener - very good, strongness reduced with glycerin&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pharm Herbal Breath Tonic Peppermint - no, far too strong,&lt;br /&gt;oramd bottle- no , too difficult to get out the bottle because of a design flaw&lt;br /&gt;california xtracts breath refresh - yes, sweetened to reduce the strongness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oramd spray - yes, strong but effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every other breath spray - full of weird chemicals, including the one by Dr Mercola</li>
    <li> This stuff is so nasty tasting that I can&#x27;t get past it to try it long enough. I tossed it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I really like it. It leaves your mouth feeling fresh for a long time. It is a little strong for one of my family members. I love that it contains nothing harmful in this spray. I&#x27;m a teacher that likes to have my breath fresh for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a blogger that did get this product for review. I write my true opinion.</li>
    <li> I was sent a sample of this product for review and overall I think it&#x27;s great. It is small enough to fit in your purse for when you don&#x27;t have a toothbrush handy but need some freshening up. It has a very minty taste and the first couple of times burned a little but not anymore. It doesn&#x27;t just mask bad breath but gets rid of the cause.</li>
    <li> OraMD Breath is a 100% pure breath spray that works really great! It can be a little powerful so the tiniest spray is all you need. It has a great minty tastes and lasts longer than any other breath spray I have ever tried. You will see your dental health improve as it kills bad breath and the bacteria that causes it. Plus its the perfect travel size for a pocket or purse.  I recently quit smoking and this has helped tremendously to keep me on track and keep my breath fresh.  I have been using it for a few weeks and the bottle is still pretty full. If you have a dietary need and are concerned, don&#x27;t be because all of the ingredients are 100% pure and is naturally gluten free, no preservatives, no sweeteners, and no added coloring.</li>
    <li> Potent in a good way. I&#x27;m a garlic eater and I can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t be without this.  It works like nothing I&#x27;ve encountered and it really lasts.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I mean after reading those facts how can you not be interested in using the breath spray. I love anything that uses essential oils because I know I am using a great product that won&#x27;t harm my body when I am trying to do something good for my health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the pieces of advice they give you is that the first couple of times you try the breath spray it will be strong. I didn&#x27;t think I had anything to worry about as, I have used their products before. Well, I was way wrong. The first time I sprayed my mouth, WOWZERS (I know not a word but it&#x27;s the only one that will work). The first spray is a like a gentle kick in the mouth, it wakes your mouth up and bam, no more bad breath. I could instantly feel my mouth becoming cleaner. This was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I tried it, there was no gentle kick in the mouth but I could still feel the tingles as it cleaned my mouth and freshened my breath. By the third time I used it, my mouth never felt as clean. It was awesome. Don&#x27;t let anyone know but it felt better using toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read my full review here: http://www.barefootnparadise.blogspot.com/2015/04/review-oralmd-breath.html</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of OraMD Breath to review on my blog and I was very happy with the results!  As an avid coffee drinker, I appreciate that this spray works to get rid of bad breath in just one spray.  The only thing I would point out is that it has a very strong flavor from the natural mint oils in it, so if you&#x27;re averse to flavors like that this might not be for you.  But aside from that, it works very well and I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that it just takes one spray to completely eliminate embarrassing bad breath, leaving me with a really fresh, clean feeling. I like that it&#x27;s portable and I can throw it in my bag and take it anywhere with me so it would be great for those on the go. For the most part though, I like keeping it on my desk at work to use after I&#x27;ve had lunch to ensure I have fresh breath the rest of the workday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure:  I received a free bottle of this product in exchange for my honest review. No other compensation was received. All opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> When I first tried it, it was so strong and bitter. I had to rinse my mouth. After using daily for a few days, I got used to it. It&#x27;s very effective and keeps bad breath away. Its small size is good for keeping in the purse and on-the-go.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery, No Hassle.&lt;br /&gt;My First Time to Use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m certain it is Good Quality, but the Taste is hard to deal with &amp; not sure the smell is preferable to bad breath</li>
    <li> A great refreshing product that is a good compliment to OraMD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your breath feeling so fresh and clean with not very much used.  So the bottle seems to really last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review over at MomMomOnTheGo.com</li>
    <li> OraMD Breath is such a fantastic idea! Now I love their OraMD, and I must admit there has been times I wish I had it on me when we go out somewhere. Breath is perfect for that! The compact and easy to use spray bottle is amazing for a breath of freshness where ever you are! Just like their OraMD, Breath is 100% pure with no chemicals, sugars, alcohol or additives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One spray is all you need, for a quick and healthy fresh mouth.  Breath goes perfectly along with OraMD. My mouth routine has now added Breath daily! I love how I can throw this in my purse and not have to worry if I have fresh breath. Of course being all natural is a bit hit for me as well!</li>
