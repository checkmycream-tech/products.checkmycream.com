      <li>I love it for my skin!</li>
      <li>I was happy to see that it came in 32 ounces at such a great price.</li>
      <li>I LOVE all of Dermalogica&#x27;s skin care products.  </li>
      <li>This one had a piece of packaging tape on the top.</li>
      <li>i love Dermalogica and this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
      <li>I love dermalogica products</li>
      <li>I guess the better price should have tipped me off.</li>
      <li>So really, this is a great deal.  </li>
      <li>I love dermalogica products.  </li>
      <li>It is simply the best there is.</li>
      <li>Excellent product that lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>the skin really bad.&lt;br /&gt;I think it will be great for teenagers but not for an old prune like me.</li>
      <li>I have used this special cleaning gel for 10 years.</li>
      <li>I have used Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel for years.  </li>
      <li>I hope they give a full refund.</li>
      <li>Love Dermalogica, and love buying in larger quantities to reduce the cost.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it was delivered.</li>
      <li>but the seller was quick to make it right since I lost product out of the bottle during shipment.</li>
      <li>Great for almost all skin types and definitely for sensitive skin like mine.  </li>
      <li>The 32 ounce package is well worth it.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it is gentle to sensitive skin but leaves you with an extremely clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>For that I was very greatful!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>It looks used and smells funny.</li>
      <li>The product I received in my first purchase was leaking and I believe the problem came from the cap.</li>
      <li>Also it is very drying to my skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real deal</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe this to be the real product.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend NOT purchasing this product from this amazon seller.</li>
      <li>but as a prior reviewer indicated - there is no seal on the container, no gray box and only partially filled.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>This means that I have to use twice as much with each use, and I may as well have purchased a brand new item at the regular price!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t typically write too many reviews but figured I would on this product to hopefully save someone else from making the same mistake I did.</li>
      <li>The color (yellow tint) and smell are different that the remaining Dermalogica cleanser in the smaller bottle I bought from my local beauty supply store with the official seal (no color, very light scent).</li>
      <li>I have used this cleansing gel for years purchased directly from Dermalogica but decided to try to save some money and purchase here.</li>
      <li>This product is wow to remove makeup</li>
      <li>Once I opened, I saw the whole plastic bag which wrapped my cleansing gel flow out and the cap did not close properly.</li>
      <li>It has changed my blemished skin into soft and radiant.</li>
      <li>for my sensitive skin and skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
      <li>I seriously need to pay more attention to the sizes noted.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I will never buy these products from anyone other than a salon even if I have to pay the higher prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s hard to resist in such a large bottle for the reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>It does not dry your skin out and keeps you from having those teenage breakouts at 40.  </li>
</ol>

<li> Safety seal was removed and the cleanser lid broke off in the package and leaked all over all other products that I purchased damaging everything that I bought.</li>
<li> The consistency of the gel was also thinner as if it had been thinned down a little.</li>
<li> I opened the bottle - it was not full - maybe it leaked out?</li>
<li> Does not leave a residue or leave your skin feeling tight.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> As I have been using this I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t smell like the dermalogica products I have used in the past.  </li>
<li> I received this without the usual Dermalogica safety seal on the bottle and became suspicious.</li>
<li> When I received the product, like other reviewers, the seal was broken and pump had been used.</li>
<li> I have never had a bad experience from Amazon orders.</li>
<li> /&gt;Very disappointed.......</li>

    <li> Great stuff...a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically write too many reviews but figured I would on this product to hopefully save someone else from making the same mistake I did. I would highly recommend NOT purchasing this product from this amazon seller. I have used this cleansing gel for years purchased directly from Dermalogica but decided to try to save some money and purchase here. When I received the product, like other reviewers, the seal was broken and pump had been used. The consistency of the gel was also thinner as if it had been thinned down a little. This means that I have to use twice as much with each use, and I may as well have purchased a brand new item at the regular price! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The safety seal wasn&#x27;t on the bottle and Dermalogica products come with the seal.  I finally found the seal that someone had placed under the bottle??  I contacted the vendor and they told me that this is how they receive the product from the company.  Dermalogica would never send a product without the safety seal.  The seal ensures that no one has tampered with the product.  Now I&#x27;m unsure if I should trust this clearly previously opened bottle or send it back.  Next time, I&#x27;ll order from Dermalogica and not try to skimp on the price.</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle and it was the same thing. There was no safety seal!! I have ordered various Dermalogica products from the store or from other websites and they all came in either sealed boxes or had the dermalogica tape seal. This one had a piece of packaging tape on the top. I opened the bottle - it was not full - maybe it leaked out? It looks used and smells funny. I have used this special cleaning gel for 10 years. I hope they give a full refund. I have never had a bad experience from Amazon orders. I will never order from this company again!</li>
    <li> i love Dermalogica and this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product highly.&lt;br /&gt;great for my sensitive skin and skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;its a must have product for me.</li>
    <li> The special cleansing gel is great! I love it for my skin!</li>
    <li> This cleaner is great!  It does not dry your skin out and keeps you from having those teenage breakouts at 40.  Does not leave a residue or leave your skin feeling tight.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is gentle to sensitive skin but leaves you with an extremely clean feeling.  I also use the moisturizer as well.  I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This product is wow to remove makeup and  It doesn’t burn the eyes however  it dries  the skin really bad.&lt;br /&gt;I think it will be great for teenagers but not for an old prune like me. I’m 57.</li>
    <li> This product does not appear to be the actual item.  I love dermalogica products but as a prior reviewer indicated - there is no seal on the container, no gray box and only partially filled.  I don&#x27;t believe this to be the real product.  I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> I love dermalogica products.  Was so happy when I could purchase this product in 32 oz. and the great price.  As I have been using this I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t smell like the dermalogica products I have used in the past.  Also it is very drying to my skin. I will never buy these products from anyone other than a salon even if I have to pay the higher prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.......</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I was happy to see that it came in 32 ounces at such a great price. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it was delivered.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that lasts a long time.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel for years.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  It has changed my blemished skin into soft and radiant.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best products I have ever tried.  I would recommend all of the dermalogica products. I use several of the serums and moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Today I received my Cleansing Gel. Once I opened, I saw the whole plastic bag which wrapped my cleansing gel flow out and the cap did not close properly. What happen. I now left 1/4 of the cleansing gel in my bottle. I hope your side could give me an answer for it.</li>
    <li> The 32 ounce package is well worth it. It will last for a very long time. Will definitely order again once it&#x27;s finished.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> It was not factory sealed, therefor not a new product as advertised.  It also smelled different than the dermalogica that I have been using for the past 10 years.  I also had to pay for shipping the product back.</li>
    <li> I seriously need to pay more attention to the sizes noted.  I thought this was a much larger bottle; I was thinking it was gallon size.  Of course, it&#x27;s still a great deal even at 32oz. And, of course, a gallon would take my husband and I about 5 years probably to use up.  So really, this is a great deal.  I LOVE all of Dermalogica&#x27;s skin care products.  I will occasionally try something else, something more expensive, something less expensive, but I always circle back around to Dermalogica.  It is simply the best there is.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cleanser!</li>
    <li> I received this without the usual Dermalogica safety seal on the bottle and became suspicious. The color (yellow tint) and smell are different that the remaining Dermalogica cleanser in the smaller bottle I bought from my local beauty supply store with the official seal (no color, very light scent). I don&#x27;t think this is the real deal and so I am sending it back to Amazon. I guess the better price should have tipped me off. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Product leaked in shipping. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item twice. The product I received in my first purchase was leaking and I believe the problem came from the cap. The packaging has improved with additional tape to hold the cap still in my second purchase. I am very happy when I receive it without leaking :)</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash! If you have any sensitivity to soaps, this is a great wash to use!</li>
    <li> Great cleanser!  Very light and great for oily skin!  Great price!</li>
    <li> Product is great...works just as good as it did when I worked in a salon an bought it from a coworker who sold it. Exactly what I expected. Only problem was the packaging should have been in a box but the seller was quick to make it right since I lost product out of the bottle during shipment. For that I was very greatful!</li>
    <li> I buy the big jug on-line because where I live it is difficult to find.</li>
    <li> good quality, goot price and Item delivered on time,</li>
    <li> This is my go-to facial cleanser and it&#x27;s hard to resist in such a large bottle for the reasonable price.  End up saving a lot of money for the value of the product.  Great for almost all skin types and definitely for sensitive skin like mine.  Very great products</li>
    <li> Love Dermalogica, and love buying in larger quantities to reduce the cost.</li>
    <li> Safety seal was removed and the cleanser lid broke off in the package and leaked all over all other products that I purchased damaging everything that I bought.</li>
