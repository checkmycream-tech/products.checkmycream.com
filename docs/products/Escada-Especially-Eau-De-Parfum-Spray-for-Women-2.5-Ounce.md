      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This perfume lasts ALL day &amp; smells amazing.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this fragrance when I received a postcard sample and couldn&#x27;t wait to get my own bottle.  </li>
      <li>It is in the same time flirty,elegant,misterious,high-society, perfect for a lady,perfect for a student and ...</li>
      <li>I decided to take a look on Amazon, and found it at a much better price.</li>
      <li>I received so many compliments</li>
      <li>In fact, many perfumes make my allergies flare up, so I never spend the money.</li>
      <li>Rosy and sophisticated, yet it can also be sexy.</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s prices are definitely better than Sephora&#x27;s too :)</li>
      <li>That said, I do so love the smell and just wish that it was stronger and had more staying power.  </li>
      <li>It is most definitely more of a spring and summer wear</li>
      <li>The ladies in my household love it.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes that I have ever purchased.</li>
      <li>I too love the alluring scent.</li>
      <li>So cheap!</li>
      <li>I had a sample of tthis product from Sephora and my husband fell in love with the smell.  </li>
      <li>I love this fragrance - there&#x27;s a very appealing fresh quality to it that I absolutely love</li>
      <li>Got this for my mom and she loves it and this was a super amazing deal.</li>
      <li>Lovely, light fragrance.</li>
      <li>Light fragrance that does over power.  </li>
      <li>This is my new favorite perfume and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that my bf loves it too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of those ladies gifted with the inability to buy fragrance without wearing it first.</li>
      <li>Item is original, and lives up to its description.</li>
      <li>The scent is floral &amp; sweet but still light.</li>
      <li>The notes are fresh and sweet but not overpowering and it lasts all day!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this very fine perfume.</li>
      <li>Maybe more suitable for younger women.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s been out of stock at Sephora where I was prepared to pay full price.  </li>
      <li>It is feminine, yet not cloyingly sweet.  </li>
      <li>I found the full size on Amazon and had to buy it.</li>
      <li>And although I still love Laila, Escada is now my current favorite fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This perfume came a lot faster than expected and the smell is absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>happened to be lucky to get a sample of Especially Escada from their website and I am so pleased that I did!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about Escada perfumes but after receiving a sample from Sephora I had to buy the full size!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend getting it for a special girl!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh, feminine, and stays on well during</li>
      <li>After it was on her for fifteen minutes or so, whatever my nose had initially found offensive dissipated, and I really liked how it smelled on her.</li>
      <li>Fragrence a little too strong, although I liked it.  </li>
      <li>So sweet and gentle to the senses</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m in the market for something fresh to wear and this fragrance is surprisingly pretty on me.</li>
      <li>My body chemistry rarely agrees with the scents I fall in love with on paper making them smell utterly putrid after the topnotes settle.</li>
      <li>Will reorder, absolutely!</li>
      <li>I have received many compliments when wearing Especially Escada.</li>
      <li>Price was also better then what was offered locally.</li>
      <li>It could be something about how it reacts with certain people that causes the scent to fade early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>however the downside is I like it so much after a while</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s already light from the start when you open the bottle (the sample in the postcard must have been fortified to last)and</li>
      <li>Very pricey, though.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I really didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
      <li>I use it every day, and after 3 months, I have still not tired of the scent.  </li>
      <li>I really like the way it smells</li>
      <li>This is very youthful and feminine scent</li>
      <li>The sent lasts a long time and it is not too strong.</li>
      <li>highly recommend and does not change scent during wear even if you sweat.</li>
      <li>And with Escada, you are investing in a high quality perfume.</li>
      <li>Due to the interaction with the wearer&#x27;s own chemistry, a perfume may smell one way on one person and very different on another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I received several samples from sephora and simply escada was my favorite by far.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s frustrating to the point I never trust my nose until I&#x27;ve worn a scent but good luck getting</li>
      <li>When I received it, I opened it up to find that the appearance and quality are exactly the same as what I was overpaying for at Sephora.</li>
      <li>Still not decided if I&#x27;ll buy it again because it&#x27;s pretty pricey and may not be worth it at its current pricing what with the fragrance not long lasting.</li>
      <li>Perfume was a Christmas gift for my 25 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
      <li>I had read reviews warning that it wasn&#x27;t a very strong fragrance, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be as weak as it is.  </li>
      <li>I highly suggest buying smaller volumes if you are not using it every day.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this for a bride on her wedding day or someone in their 20&#x27;s looking for a floral that&#x27;s not too girly, nor too mature but ultimately feminine.</li>
      <li>I went to purchase the full-sized version on the original beauty site but the price was hard to rationalize.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s barely noticeable 30 minutes later.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect, just what the wife wanted. Made her happy, makes me happy.</li>
    <li> I do not like this fragrance at all. It&#x27;s a strange blend of woodsy/musky/floral/fruity notes that is a bit masculine and a bit weird, quite frankly. I do not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a perfume fanatic. In fact, many perfumes make my allergies flare up, so I never spend the money. However, I received several samples from sephora and simply escada was my favorite by far.  I put it on in the morning and after work, my husband can still smell it. It drives him crazy:) as with all aromatic oils, every scent reacts differently with people&#x27;s various chemistries. This one is a life long buy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t describe this perfume in words,cause is that amazing! It is in the same time flirty,elegant,misterious,high-society, perfect for a lady,perfect for a student and ...so on! I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Perfume was a Christmas gift for my 25 year old daughter and she loves it. Price was also better then what was offered locally. Amazon does an excellent job of providing great products and superb service/delivery.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it smells and it seems to last on me for a very long time however the downside is I like it so much after a while I can&#x27;t tell I have it on but that seems to happen with every scent that I like a lot</li>
    <li> I thought I had found my forever fragrance in Laila.  And although I still love Laila, Escada is now my current favorite fragrance.  This is the best smelling perfume I have discovered since I discovered Laila 5 years ago.  I use it every day, and after 3 months, I have still not tired of the scent.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Very pricey, though.  But from what I have learned, you get what you pay for.  And with Escada, you are investing in a high quality perfume.</li>
    <li> Great price on a great fragrance! I use Especially almost exclusively - I suppose it&#x27;s my signature fragrance now. Rosy and sophisticated, yet it can also be sexy.</li>
    <li> Got it for a christmas present for my wife and she loves it. She actually requested it specifically after having a sample of it and once I gave it to her for christmas she loved even more every day she wore it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about Escada perfumes but after receiving a sample from Sephora I had to buy the full size! Amazon&#x27;s prices are definitely better than Sephora&#x27;s too :) This perfume lasts ALL day &amp; smells amazing. The scent is floral &amp; sweet but still light. Definitely not overpowering</li>
    <li> This perfume came a lot faster than expected and the smell is absolutely amazing! Highly recommend getting it for a special girl!</li>
    <li> Lovely, light fragrance. Very pleasant floral scent. Not overpowering. I have received many compliments when wearing Especially Escada. I like that people need to ask me what fragrance I am wearing rather than recognizing the scent. Nice not to smell like the celebrity scent of the day!</li>
    <li> Light fragrance that does over power.  great for summer.  highly recommend and does not change scent during wear even if you sweat.</li>
    <li> I was told once that if you wear this perfume, you can get  what ever you want... We&#x27;ll see. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this scent!!! It&#x27;s perfect for the springtime but if you love perfume with floral notes like I do, you will wear this all year around!</li>
    <li> Everything I hoped it would be and at the best price! Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this product! It smells beautifully, and is now my most favourite perfume! Item is original, and lives up to its description.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those ladies gifted with the inability to buy fragrance without wearing it first. My body chemistry rarely agrees with the scents I fall in love with on paper making them smell utterly putrid after the topnotes settle. It&#x27;s frustrating to the point I never trust my nose until I&#x27;ve worn a scent but good luck getting samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to be lucky to get a sample of Especially Escada from their website and I am so pleased that I did! Florals are not a favorite of mine but I&#x27;m in the market for something fresh to wear and this fragrance is surprisingly pretty on me. This is very youthful and feminine scent but it didn&#x27;t last very long on me. It is most definitely more of a spring and summer wear fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate rose this fragrance is definitely not for you. It is the dominant note from start to finish. Think lush pink cabbage roses in springtime. Though I decided it isn&#x27;t the scent I am looking for in regards to my style I couldn&#x27;t help but review it because it is a very lovely scent. I would recommend this for a bride on her wedding day or someone in their 20&#x27;s looking for a floral that&#x27;s not too girly, nor too mature but ultimately feminine.</li>
    <li> Best fragrance ever... So sweet and gentle to the senses</li>
    <li> I had a sample of tthis product from Sephora and my husband fell in love with the smell.  He said he could eat it . That is how wonderful it smelled to him .  So of course I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Fragrence a little too strong, although I liked it.  Maybe more suitable for younger women. My daughter loved it, so I passed it along.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume after I tested out a mini-version I received as a gift-with-purchase on another site. I received so many compliments I knew I had to invest in a larger bottle. I went to purchase the full-sized version on the original beauty site but the price was hard to rationalize. I found the full size on Amazon and had to buy it. This is my new favorite perfume and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that my bf loves it too! The notes are fresh and sweet but not overpowering and it lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I get compliments every time I wear this, and it&#x27;s gotten harder to find it. Got it for a great deal here and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The ladies in my household love it. I too love the alluring scent. I highly recommend this very fine perfume.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom and she loves it and this was a super amazing deal. So cheap!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance - there&#x27;s a very appealing fresh quality to it that I absolutely love and I think it has excellent staying power.  This is an AWESOME price for it - it&#x27;s $82 everywhere else that I was able to find it, and I&#x27;m very happy it&#x27;s been out of stock at Sephora where I was prepared to pay full price.  Will reorder, absolutely!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to review products that can&#x27;t be objectively judged, and perfumes are the epitome of that description. What one person likes, another may not. Due to the interaction with the wearer&#x27;s own chemistry, a perfume may smell one way on one person and very different on another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my wife had me smell the magazine sample, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. In fact, I really didn&#x27;t like it at all. Even though I didn&#x27;t care for it, she was so hung up on the scent that I decided to get it and the body moisturizer for her as a Valentine&#x27;s gift.  She was very happy with her gift, but when she first put the perfume on, again, I didn&#x27;t care for it all. After it was on her for fifteen minutes or so, whatever my nose had initially found offensive dissipated, and I really liked how it smelled on her. Also, unlike some of the other reviewers, the scent seemed to last a long time. My wife put it on around 10 am and it was still noticeable this evening, but only from a few feet away, so I wouldn&#x27;t call the scent \\&quot;weak\\&quot; as some have. Of course, referring back to my opening statement, perfume works differently from one person to the next. It could be something about how it reacts with certain people that causes the scent to fade early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, it was a good buy and both my wife and I are happy with the perfume.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this fragrance when I received a postcard sample and couldn&#x27;t wait to get my own bottle.  I had read reviews warning that it wasn&#x27;t a very strong fragrance, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be as weak as it is.  I&#x27;m not one for strong overpowering fragrances, but I&#x27;ve never experienced a fragrance so weak!  It&#x27;s already light from the start when you open the bottle (the sample in the postcard must have been fortified to last)and it&#x27;s barely noticeable 30 minutes later.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me but, judging from those reviews I mentioned, others have the same opinion.  So, it&#x27;s a disappointment in that sense.  That said, I do so love the smell and just wish that it was stronger and had more staying power.  Still not decided if I&#x27;ll buy it again because it&#x27;s pretty pricey and may not be worth it at its current pricing what with the fragrance not long lasting.</li>
    <li> I have never been disappointed with this companies perfume.  The sent lasts a long time and it is not too strong.</li>
    <li> Love it! awesome price, and the item is original.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes that I have ever purchased. I was originally getting it from Sephora, but it was so expensive. I decided to take a look on Amazon, and found it at a much better price. When I received it, I opened it up to find that the appearance and quality are exactly the same as what I was overpaying for at Sephora. I love a good bargain!</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s fresh, feminine, and stays on well during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this perfume for almost a year now, and the fragrance is changing. I highly suggest buying smaller volumes if you are not using it every day. I only use it several times a week, and still have about 1/2 of 1.6 bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest buying this in 1.6 oz bottle - you might need to replace it before even that runs out.</li>
    <li> Love this scent!  It is feminine, yet not cloyingly sweet.  I can use just a bit and it lasts all day.</li>
</ol>
