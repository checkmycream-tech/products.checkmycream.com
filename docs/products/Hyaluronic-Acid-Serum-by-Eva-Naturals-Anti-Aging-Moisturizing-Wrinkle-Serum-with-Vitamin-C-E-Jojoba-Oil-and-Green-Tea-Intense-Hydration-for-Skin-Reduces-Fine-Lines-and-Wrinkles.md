<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> so far just getting to try the product for a few days it seems to be doing very well. Some of the parts of this product are very good for the skin. I am so glad that i got and cant wait to have beautiful skin by the time summer comes.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality product and I love it.</li>
    <li> Very good serum.  Absorbs quickly leaving no sticky residue behind.  Great under makeup.  I purchased this at a huge discount to try.  Will be reordering.</li>
    <li> This serum is great!  It&#x27;s thick and stays on my face.  Keeps it moistorized as well.  It makes my skin feel smooth and for about an hour after use it still looks dewy.  The price was great for the large bottle as well!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week and already notice fine lines smoothing and becoming less noticeable. It is a great addition to my nightly bedtime routine. When I wake up, the serum did it&#x27;s work overnight and I even look more refreshed and natural in the mornings.</li>
    <li> Till now i am liking it.I had dry skin around my mouth .After using it for 2 days,dryness started fading off.I am not sure whether this product has done it or the other.I am using it along with vaseline petroleum jelly but overall i am getting result because of one of these products or may be both.</li>
    <li> This product has improved the smoothness of my skin!!! Love it</li>
    <li> Product was delivered very quick. Looking forward to start using it and hopefully seeing results.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long but I have already seen slight changes; wrinkles are minimized and a a little firmer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I works makes your skin tighter will be buying this again</li>
    <li> I only just received this product so I can&#x27;t really make a substantial review yet, but it seems to work okay, it smells great and it got here very fast.</li>
    <li> I like this serum.  I had tried Neutrogena blue jar Hylaronic Acid and it was making my face blue..  This is a clear serum similar to another brand I bought.  It does help the texture somewhat and I can see a little plumping.  The Vitamin E and Jobaba see oil is a bonus.  I think they are reasonable and good products by Eva Natural.  Surely worth trying.  ITS BEEN TWO WEEKS AND STILL LOVE ...LOVE...THIS STUFF.</li>
    <li> Not sure what improvements you are supposed to see. I do think it adds moisture to my skin but no other visible results so far.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for so long to say anything about the wrikle reducer part but so far I like it, it has good ingredients and I bought it because I ran out of my old hyaloronic acid serum and I found this one with loving ingredients that is made by a small company who actually cares what they put in their products , I&#x27;m planning to buy and try other products they have.. So far I&#x27;m pleased..</li>
    <li> first of all This  is  the best to get to try a product at near costing near to zero with discount.  This serum is very light feel to face.  Does not leave a greasy or tight feeling after drying. Simple to apply , have no problems putting my makeup over and the container easy open for dispense</li>
    <li> I will buy again. On my deep wrinkle that makes me look like i have a permanent MAD FACE...i noticed a difference the first day.....The NEXT day, one of my friends asked me if i had a &#x27;spa treatment&#x27;....so....if i notice a difference and others notice a difference (in one day)....then pffffttttttt, i am sold and it is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Using everyday and will reorder for sure, thank you!  Update!  I have been using this serum now for quite some time.  I have to say that my complexion has changed for the better, my pores are refined and my skin glows....thank you!</li>
    <li> The  Hyaluronic Acid Serum was delivered in a timely fashion, packaged in an excellent way,  I have begun using it and so far I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have noticed a big improvement in my skin.  I use it twice a day, with great results.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product and we use it often</li>
    <li> It does appear to help, but still too early to tell if it helps a lot....I was hoping to see if it helped to get rid of bags under the eyes....does provide the moisture, but I need probably another month to see the results.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Makes skin feel fantastic!!</li>
    <li> You will feel this working as soon as you put it on your skin. My skin felt tight, the lines smoothed out some. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do over time.</li>
    <li> very smooth which leaves my skin soft and not oily which is a problem I have.  great customer service, excellent price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I was happy to see that the bottle was a pump bottle and not the dropper as shown.  I tend to like the pump bottles the best, there is less chance of spilling it.  I was happy with the size of the bottle and since a little goes a long way, I was very pleased.  I just incorporated it into my nightly face cleaning ritual.  After cleansing and toning, I put this on just before my moisturizer.  It was thicker than some serums I have used, I liked that!  After it soaked in my face was not left feeling oily or sticky.  I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> This is my third brand of Hyaluronic Acid Serum. The first was too thick, the second was too watery &amp; the Eva Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum has the just right amount of consistency. A small amount goes a long way &amp; is quickly absorbed. The double size for the money makes it cost effective. So far this is my favorite!.</li>
    <li> I have now used this for 3 days. I have even used it in my hands. It seems to work very well. My hands and my neck show my age a lot. This serum makes my hands, face and neck softer. I am sure it will take longer than 3 days to see actual results, but I still think it was a good buy. If it continues to work , I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> at first I was a little unsure about the product, but my skin is amazingly smooth  everybody should try this one. I sure reorder :)</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used this. Can&#x27;t wait to see how well it works long term. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product broke my face out pretty bad not impressed at all</li>
    <li> Really loving this brand. Everything I have tried has been non irritating to my sensitve skin. Ive only been using this for a a short time so I am not sure what the results will be like. It absorbs quickly without feeling sticky. I use it every night before I go to bed. Love this product so far.</li>
    <li> great purchase..easy and fast</li>
    <li> I got this product to help my skin, because i haven&#x27;t been the best with my skin so i bought this stuff to help keep my skin youthful and healthy. I used it last night and i&#x27;m going to use this everyday to see if it has more results :)</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, great smell! I love this stuff seems to be working already and haven&#x27;t been using it that long can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after using it for a while</li>
    <li> This is a good size bottle esp for the price. After using it only a couple of weeks, I can already tell that my skin looks much better. I have gotten compliments that my skin looks younger and more radiant.</li>
    <li> seeing pisitive results in just 2 days!</li>
    <li> Love it made my face real soft and fresh feeling would by again.</li>
    <li> Feel a difference in the texture of my skin since I started to use it.</li>
    <li> Terrific product that works great, Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product looking for anything that would help the facial dryness that I have been experiencing with growing older.  This definitely works for that, completely eliminating the sandpaper feeling on my face. I would recommend this to anyone dealing with the changes of skin texture that comes with aging.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Second try at hyaluronic acid serum....the first was too thin, runny...couldn&#x27;t see much change after three months.  This product WORKS! The serum is heavier but not sticky....doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue so your regular moisturizer can follow once the serum has dried in a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;In three weeks, my neck is smoother, the line on my forehead is diminished which was my main interest.  I&#x27;m happy and will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  Need to use longer to determine results</li>
    <li> Serum is easily absorbed. Smoothes and leaves skin feeling wonderfully soft. Wear under moisturizer and make up application is flawless.</li>
    <li> Feels  great on my skin. Have only been using it for 2-3 days , can already see an improvement.</li>
    <li> Good stuff works on my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Feels smooth and silky on my skin. I just started using the serum so I will return in a few weeks to update!</li>
    <li> This is a fine quality product and a generous size bottle for the price. I like the fact that this serum doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling sticky or greasy. I use it before my moisturizer and it sinks right in. Any product that can be layered without any peeling (those weird little balls from rubbing product into your skin) is an A + in my book. My skin is in pretty good overall condition but I wanted to add something to my skin care regimen to maintain what I have. So far so good.</li>
    <li> All the Eva Natural products work beautifully and perform just as their description reads. I use this for some moisture with the 2.5 retinol-and I also use the eye gel for that very &amp;#34;telling&amp;#34; eye area :) Again, these products preform-they&#x27;re natural!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, I use it at night and have noticed a slight difference around my eyes, I apply the serum before applying my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one month and I saw results in less than a week. I currently use a konjac charcoal sponge with a cleansing oil and finish with a facial oil (rosheip or maracuja or something in that family). I With this I started to notice a fresher and brighter complexion but I wanted to add a serum to my regimen and knew the benefits of the hyaluronic acid. I am telling you, my face became smoother and the fine lines and wrinkles were vastly improved. This serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly and comes in a pump bottle. I still followup with a facial oil which is the best thing you can do if you have oily or combination skin. Lastly, no skin irritation or acne issues and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! Fully recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is a really great product for helping your skin look better. All the ingredients in this bottle are so good for your skin. Just a little of this serum goes a long way.  It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel taut.  Not only does it help with my fine lines, it is also fading some of my skin imperfections like sun damage areas.  My complexion is looking better with each day I use this...I put it on in morning before make-up and the end of the day before bed....Great price for this size bottle.</li>
    <li> This serum from Eva Naturals goes on very easy. I have only been using it for one week and will give a more detailed review after I have used it a month. I do however like the way it goes on easy and dries very quickly. That means you can put your moisturizer or make-up on within seconds.</li>
    <li> Loving the serum by Eva Naturals. Beginning to see a real difference in my skin.  Hoping for even better results after longer use.</li>
    <li> awesome stuff try it!</li>
    <li> I am 50, have dry skin and this feels  wonderful  Apply before moisturizing for best results. It makes any moisturizer work better.  The only difference is mine came in a pump bottle, which I love.  Will definitely buy this again!!!</li>
    <li> It does seem to be helping. Mum says that my face is looking better and she is a tough ccritic. Wrinkles getting smaller</li>
    <li> It seems to brighten my skin, I feel as if I have a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to myself.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Absorbs quickly - does not feel greasy.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any results - but I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I love the was this makes my skin feel afterwards! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice anything yet, but Love it so far!</li>
    <li> Dried my face out terrible.....</li>
    <li> Really quick shipping.  Great product so far love it!  Great Deal.</li>
    <li> goes on smooth and make skin feel very smooth a good</li>
