      <li>These tattoos are really cool, and they do last a long time.</li>
      <li>Mine have lasted a whole week through seawater activities (as long as you don&#x27;t scrub the tattoos when showering)</li>
      <li>They last several days; the one on my wrist lasted about three days and the one on my ankle for much longer, almost two weeks.</li>
      <li>It stays on for approximately 4 days or easy taken off with baby oil.</li>

    <li> I bought these for my daughter and she loves them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard whispers of this type of product selling around local small businesses in Las Vegas but didn&#x27;t think much of it until I saw it in person on one of my girlfriends this past week. At first glance I thought it was a piece of jewerly but told me it was a temporary tattoo. I had to get it myself as it is very eye catching. Colors are vibrant and shiny on the skin and it doesn&#x27;t give that fake look, almost as if it really is painted on. It stays on for approximately 4 days or easy taken off with baby oil.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these flash tattoos! They are so cool and beautiful. they go on easily and stay on for a few days, even up to 5 or 6 days if you don&#x27;t scrub it in the shower. Do note they will leave tan lines! But the tan lines look cool!</li>
    <li> I loved the tattoos! I used them for a music festival at the beach. They stayed on for 4 days in the heat and with me sweating. I would recommend them for anyone! My favorite tattoo was the necklace. There are so many different designs you can create.</li>
    <li> These Jewelry Tattoos are Awesome!! So pretty and so fun!! Lasts through a day at the lake! Great way to wear jewelry!</li>
    <li> I have bought other flash tattoos before and these by far are my favorite! The design and color really stands out and quality is good too. I will totally buy again!  I used it for my trip to Greek Islands and they were perfect. There were many people who complimented me on these tattoos and they wanted to know where I got them from too!&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact Malibu Blue offers unique color and design.  They truly stand out!</li>
    <li> Love these so much! Cant wait to wear them to Coachella next weekend. Stay on even in the shower. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!!</li>
    <li> These tattoos are really cool, and they do last a long time. I also like that they have blue, and not just gold. However, I work trade shows in Vegas, and some of these reviews are painfully obvious in how fake they are. Reviews are for customers to share their experience, no matter what it is, for other customers. It isn&#x27;t a place to advertise, or give fake testimonials. Let your product speak for itself. It&#x27;s really irritating when people give fake testimonials. I&#x27;ve bought this brand before so I know they&#x27;re good, but I actually decided to buy another set today because of how irritated I was with the sleezy nature of the first few reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing against the seller, by the way. Often times it&#x27;s the whole sale people who do things like this. You never know.</li>
    <li> These were great editions to apply on my and my friend&#x27;s bodies for Coachella.  I loved the turquoise.  These lasted 3 days, even though sweat and pool parties, but these definitely require careful removal of the backing paper.  Try not to place on anywhere the skin will stretch with movement because it&#x27;ll cause this to crack.</li>
    <li> Really love this product! Easy to apply &amp; the tatts stay on...even through a day at the pool! Colors are vibrant &amp; the designs are pretty.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the flash tats I ordered from Malibu Blue! They are a good quality and are the perfect summer accessory! I got so many compliments on them! Will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> the tattoos were everything i could&#x27;ve imagined them to be!</li>
    <li> Great designs! love them they look fabulous!</li>
    <li> These are so pretty and easy to apply.They last several days; the one on my wrist lasted about three days and the one on my ankle for much longer, almost two weeks. I haven&#x27;t tried the necklace tattoo yet. For best application, I&#x27;d suggest having someone help, especially in hard to reach areas. I love the turquoise and silver colors the best; the gold doesn&#x27;t show up quite as well on tanned Caucasian skin, at least for me.</li>
    <li> Product was fantastic. I wore them to the beach. Great accent piece. My friends demanded I tell them where I got them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this look on models and other photography but hadn&#x27;t actually seem it in person. I ordered this brand because I liked that it wasn&#x27;t just gold, not also turquoise too. I freakin love the designs and can&#x27;t wait to rock them at euphoria fest and coaches this year. Boom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a huge new trend here in Las Vegas these will be all over the place next year.. Be a Trend Setter and sport your girl with some of these i highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I got my order quickly each time and I&#x27;m thrilled at how well the complimented my cocktail dress! EvEveryonelways asks about them &amp;#60;3</li>

    <li> I loved how they looked but they wore off a lot faster than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. Only lasted about 2 days.</li>
    <li> I love these tattoos-- the colors are very vibrant, and all the designs are so pretty. I&#x27;ve found that the tattoos have really long staying power too. Mine have lasted a whole week through seawater activities (as long as you don&#x27;t scrub the tattoos when showering)</li>
