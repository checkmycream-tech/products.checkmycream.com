      <li>I LOVE this product!</li>

      <li>I have honestly tried hundreds thru the years and the benefits for your skin put it at the top of my list.</li>
      <li>it gives that nice healthy glow&lt;</li>
      <li>So far, this is the best BB Cream I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect if you have super pale skin, it matches perfectly and you don&#x27;t have to worry about seeing lines or anything after the neck area.</li>
      <li>I use the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer in Chantilly, if that helps anyone get a better idea for color matching.</li>
      <li>and I love it :))</li>
      <li>and I will look no further for the perfect foundation.</li>
      <li>I think another one of their BB creams would be better for you.</li>
      <li>It is now my favorite day-to-day makeup</li>
      <li>Coverage is more like a sheer/medium foundation rather than a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>My bronzer and blush go on much better when I use this foundation.</li>
      <li>Really love this BB Cream.</li>
      <li>- The Light coulour is perfect for my white skin&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is very sheer, even for a BB cream, and incredibly watery.</li>
      <li>If I can have this my whole life and never have to buy another foundation, I&#x27;ll be happy (and it&#x27;s a very large bottle, so maybe!).</li>
      <li>Stays looking good all day long ,you don&#x27;t need to use much, love it!</li>
      <li>I have fair Caucasian skin, and I am just barely too light for most American brands but this matches me great.  </li>
      <li>the dewey finish is a huge plus to me.</li>
      <li>I have absurdly light skin</li>
      <li>The coverage is light</li>
      <li>Lightly moisturizing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good if you have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It really is a pale &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; color and has no yellow/warm tones which is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>At first I was a bit nervous because it goes on VERY light</li>
      <li>I also love the texture of this BB cream; it melts into my skin and looks more natural than my foundations</li>
      <li>I had much better luck with the Skin79 brand; I have used their Oriental Gold BB cream so far and love it.</li>
      <li>The milky beige matches my skin tone perfectly, which is hard for me to find, being so fair-skinned.</li>
      <li>I have several BB creams and have tried many, many samples, and this is the one I reach for 9 times out of 10.  </li>
      <li>Comes in a hygenic pump that is easy to control how much is dispensed</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, only foundation I can find that is not too orange or yellow for my fair skin tone.</li>
      <li>Rarely has a product lived up to the hype that caused me to buy it.</li>
      <li>I have some patches of very red skin and a decent bit of acne scarring and this covered it beautifully while still looking natural!</li>
      <li>I own the #13 which I estimate to be at least NC15 (in MAC shades) and probably suitable for NC/NW 10-20.  </li>
      <li>You must get the correct color however and I seem to have hit it right the first time.</li>
      <li>I usually just apply it with my fingers and rub it in a bit to evenly distribute it, then I use a damp Beauty Blender to get it nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>If I need more coverage, I&#x27;ll apply a second layer after this and blend it with the sponge again.</li>
      <li>and sometimes I apply a moisturizer first, than this BB cream, but it works well by itself too.</li>
      <li>I read several reviews before buying, and I was pleased with the result when I tried the product.</li>
      <li>I feel like my skin looks nice all day long when I wear it, especially if I have refrained from touching my face too much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d hate to be one of those reviewers who gives false hope to someone else that may not end up as happy with a product as I am, but I can honestly say this foundation is one of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I hope you agree!</li>
      <li>Blends nicely even when layered over other products like moisturizers&lt;</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my first real BB cream</li>
      <li>I have never been able to find a foundation, mineral powder, and especially not a BB cream light enough for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>can layer this product on days that I want more coverage, but usually I only need one layer and use a little concealer on top to spot cover any blemishes.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>Very lightweight and covers well.</li>
      <li>Covers very well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different foundations and coverups before but nothing ever looked natural on me.</li>
      <li>I ordered this after hearing great things on makeup/skincare forums, specifically because I have very pale, cool toned skin and many other pale women highly recommended it.</li>
      <li>&amp; I wish there was a little more coverage.  </li>
      <li>The price was very affordable and it was shipped directly from Seoul, so I am not worried about it being a fake.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it took a month to get here, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Buildable, natural looking coverage that looks like \\&quot;skin\\&quot; and not makeup&lt;</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>If it doesn&#x27;t look like there is much coverage at first, I sometimes find that waiting a few minutes to let the BB cream oxidize a bit helps, and then I ultimately use less concealer on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I read that it has pink tones, which I was actually hoping was true since my skin seems to have that, as well.</li>
      <li>So I actually ordered and paid for the Signature Real Complete BB cream in shade #13</li>
      <li>but is it is also dehydrated from being in a dry climate, and my skin is very sensitive/prone to reaction breakouts.  </li>
      <li>find this BB cream to be pretty long lasting.</li>
      <li>If you are super oily, you may want to blot or use a powder to control shine after a few hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>If you are super oily, you may want to blot or use a powder to control shine after a few hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>and you can barely tell you are wearing makeup!</li>
      <li>Covers better and for longer than other big Korean name brands I have used previously.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Forms a nice, smooth base for makeup such as contours, highlighters, and blushes.  </li>
      <li>I am caucasian but I am so pale that I struggle to find American brands that are light enough for my skin.  </li>
      <li>Thin, easy to apply consistency&lt;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When I see a product receiving rave reviews, I take them with a grain of salt. Rarely has a product lived up to the hype that caused me to buy it. But this is the exception. I LOVE this product! I never wear foundation, usually just moisturizer with bronzer and blush, but lately I&#x27;d been wanting a little more coverage. This foundation is perfect. If I can have this my whole life and never have to buy another foundation, I&#x27;ll be happy (and it&#x27;s a very large bottle, so maybe!). The milky beige matches my skin tone perfectly, which is hard for me to find, being so fair-skinned. It gives me a soft, dewy complexion that&#x27;s not too thick, but hides redness and skin imperfections. My bronzer and blush go on much better when I use this foundation. It makes me look so radiant, I don&#x27;t even need a luminizer! I&#x27;d hate to be one of those reviewers who gives false hope to someone else that may not end up as happy with a product as I am, but I can honestly say this foundation is one of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I hope you agree!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin break out</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, only foundation I can find that is not too orange or yellow for my fair skin tone. Covers better and for longer than other big Korean name brands I have used previously. I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I bought the milky beige,I have pale skin with blue under tones. Stays looking good all day long ,you don&#x27;t need to use much, love it!</li>
    <li> I have fair Caucasian skin, and I am just barely too light for most American brands but this matches me great.  This has an opalescent glow that keeps it from looking chalky like a lot of fair foundations can.  Coverage is more like a sheer/medium foundation rather than a tinted moisturizer.  Looks better than most under office lighting and looks good on me for 8 hours without primer.  I have dry skin and sometimes I apply a moisturizer first, than this BB cream, but it works well by itself too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after hearing great things on makeup/skincare forums, specifically because I have very pale, cool toned skin and many other pale women highly recommended it. It is now my favorite day-to-day makeup and I have reordered it multiple times now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a perfect match for me. It really is a pale &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; color and has no yellow/warm tones which is perfect for me. I also love the texture of this BB cream; it melts into my skin and looks more natural than my foundations and it looks dewey all day. I do not like matte face makeup, so the dewey finish is a huge plus to me. It is also a little moisturizing (I have dehydrated skin) without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can layer this product on days that I want more coverage, but usually I only need one layer and use a little concealer on top to spot cover any blemishes. I use the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer in Chantilly, if that helps anyone get a better idea for color matching. I usually just apply it with my fingers and rub it in a bit to evenly distribute it, then I use a damp Beauty Blender to get it nice and smooth. If I need more coverage, I&#x27;ll apply a second layer after this and blend it with the sponge again. Then I will use a setting spray to give it a little extra staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this BB cream to be pretty long lasting. I feel like my skin looks nice all day long when I wear it, especially if I have refrained from touching my face too much. It has surprisingly heavy coverage for how lightweight and gentle it feels. If it doesn&#x27;t look like there is much coverage at first, I sometimes find that waiting a few minutes to let the BB cream oxidize a bit helps, and then I ultimately use less concealer on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this to people before. I have and will continue to use it. Really a great product!</li>
    <li> Really love this BB Cream. It&#x27;s perfect if you have super pale skin, it matches perfectly and you don&#x27;t have to worry about seeing lines or anything after the neck area. It blends quite easily and as an added bonus, it smells great too!! It&#x27;s good if you have sensitive skin, there&#x27;s no irritation after applying it. I&#x27;m really happy with this stuff. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it took a month to get here, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and covers well.</li>
    <li> This shade (Milky Beige #13) is paper white, so I recommend adding it with a darker Missha shade and blend to your skin tone. I have absurdly light skin and it&#x27;s too much for me, but blending works best for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a BB cream, the texture is creamy and not too thick. I recommend Missha wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> This is a great BB cream, I use it in place of foundation now and I am 63, just put it on like moisturizer no muss no fuss! It is a little thicker than others I have tried and I will look no further for the perfect foundation. I have honestly tried hundreds thru the years and the benefits for your skin put it at the top of my list. You must get the correct color however and I seem to have hit it right the first time.</li>
    <li> So I actually ordered and paid for the Signature Real Complete BB cream in shade #13 but they sent me this one instead, but I&#x27;m happy they did because this one is perfect. I&#x27;m very pale and all of the American BB creams from the drug store are too dark for me, but this one matches my skintone very well. The coverage is light so if you want to even out your skin without looking like you rolled your face in cake batter, it&#x27;s great. If you need heavier coverage I think another one of their BB creams would be better for you. Also I&#x27;ve noticed that it is improving my skin gradually.</li>
    <li> I really like this product however it&#x27;s a little heavier than I like. I usually mix with one of my other facial serums to get the consistency to where I like it and it goes on smoother.</li>
    <li> This product is very sheer, even for a BB cream, and incredibly watery. It does not apply evenly to the skin and does not last long at all. I had much better luck with the Skin79 brand; I have used their Oriental Gold BB cream so far and love it.</li>
    <li> great coverage feels good</li>
    <li> I use 2 colors to achieve the perfect match.</li>
    <li> I have several BB creams and have tried many, many samples, and this is the one I reach for 9 times out of 10.  I am caucasian but I am so pale that I struggle to find American brands that are light enough for my skin.  I own the #13 which I estimate to be at least NC15 (in MAC shades) and probably suitable for NC/NW 10-20.  The price was very affordable and it was shipped directly from Seoul, so I am not worried about it being a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/combination skin but is it is also dehydrated from being in a dry climate, and my skin is very sensitive/prone to reaction breakouts.  I cannot stand to wear foundation or sunblock, and even moisturizers bother me.  I was attracted to BB creams for the subtle coverage, sun protection, moisturizers, and skin healing properties.  This is a great product and it met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great shade for lightest skin tones&lt;br /&gt;- Neutral enough for NC or NW skin tones, neither too gray, too orange, or too pink&lt;br /&gt;- Buildable, natural looking coverage that looks like \\&quot;skin\\&quot; and not makeup&lt;br /&gt;- Non-irritating, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or worsen/cause break outs&lt;br /&gt;- Good SPF/sun protection&lt;br /&gt;- Lightly moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;- Subtle glow, not too dewy or too matte, looks natural&lt;br /&gt;- Brightens skin&lt;br /&gt;- Some oil control&lt;br /&gt;- Will adjust slightly to your skin tone as it oxidizes&lt;br /&gt;- Thin, easy to apply consistency&lt;br /&gt;- Blends nicely even when layered over other products like moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;- Forms a nice, smooth base for makeup such as contours, highlighters, and blushes.  Can be used in place of a primer.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes in a hygenic pump that is easy to control how much is dispensed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Slight floral scent some may not like&lt;br /&gt;- Can settle onto dry skin flakes if you wipe/rub it on instead of tapping/patting application&lt;br /&gt;- Is not a foundation, so it will not 100% cover your blemishes, but you can build coverage on trouble spots&lt;br /&gt;- Does not have long-wear ability of a foundation&lt;br /&gt;- If you are super oily, you may want to blot or use a powder to control shine after a few hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;- Sinks into the skin, so you have to be vigilant about proper cleaning (I use a Clarisonic brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? 100%  Would I recommend it? 100%  If you are on the fence about trying BB creams, DO IT.ty of a foundation&lt;br /&gt;- If you are super oily, you may want to blot or use a powder to control shine after a few hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;- Sinks into the skin, so you have to be vigilant about proper cleaning (I use a Clarisonic brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? 100%  Would I recommend it? 100%  If you are on the fence about trying BB creams, DO IT.</li>
    <li> So far, this is the best BB Cream I&#x27;ve tried.  My skin looks smooth &amp; the color matched perfectly, which is a rarity.  The only negatives are the length of time it took to get to me &amp; I wish there was a little more coverage.  But, that&#x27;s to be expected with a BB Cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different foundations and coverups before but nothing ever looked natural on me. I have some patches of very red skin and a decent bit of acne scarring and this covered it beautifully while still looking natural! At first I was a bit nervous because it goes on VERY light but after a few minutes it sinks into your skin and you can barely tell you are wearing makeup! I have sensitive skin so I was worried I may react poorly to the BB Cream but no issues so far!</li>
    <li> Great coverage but the color was not right for my skin tone, and it too weeks to get here! Very long shipment ! Covers very well but color is hard to choose. A bit deceptive in that area. Otherwise great! Just a little hard to choose the right color. I LOVE IT EITHER WAY!!!!</li>
    <li> I have never been able to find a foundation, mineral powder, and especially not a BB cream light enough for my skin tone. I read several reviews before buying, and I was pleased with the result when I tried the product. I read that it has pink tones, which I was actually hoping was true since my skin seems to have that, as well. I recommended to several of my pale friends, and one of them ordered. I anticipate her loving it, too!</li>
    <li> - The Light coulour is perfect for my white skin&lt;br /&gt;- it gives that nice healthy glow&lt;br /&gt;- spf !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first real BB cream and I love it :))</li>
