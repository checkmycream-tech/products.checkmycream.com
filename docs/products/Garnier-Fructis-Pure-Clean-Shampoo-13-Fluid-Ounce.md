### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Anyway, now my hair is fuller looking and lays perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Best shampoo that I have ever used till date.</li>
      <li>but lol it works good for me !</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, works great.  </li>
      <li>Maybe its my hair type, but it just wasn&#x27;t good</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and it smells great.</li>
      <li>If it biodegrades, great, but I have to make sure it works and that it&#x27;s safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am guessing because, I have good nice hair ...</li>
      <li>The best part, the shampoo was very gentle on my scalp, no itchy scalp, no breakouts, no dandruff.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It foams up nicely and washes out well.</li>
      <li>and i wanted to save money and do my own hair.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and my hair is shiny and lighter.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo foams up really nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I might return this and get the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; Garnier kind (which is what I thought I was getting with this).</li>
      <li>/&gt;I ended up contacting Garnier, and the customer service was nice and sent me coupons to replace my shampoo with another garnier product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to write to this company and find out what kind of testing--</li>
      <li>Rinses out completely and it smells awesome!!!</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells good, lathers well, and rinses cleanly.</li>
      <li>and it is a nice product for fine, thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS SHAMPOO,  </li>
      <li>but I pour it into a 1-liter pump container and love it.</li>
      <li>There are too many people complaining about this product, so I might stop using it to avoid running in to any</li>
      <li>My hair has more than just split ends, it is crinkly and has three or four splits on the end of the hair and it became prone to breaking.</li>
      <li>But I am so glad that I did.  </li>
      <li>Though Matrix leaves my  hair in a better condition, I do not dare to use it for what it does to my scalp.</li>
      <li>On top of that it irritated my skin.</li>
      <li>and I am allergic to most shampoos/ conditioners.</li>
      <li>Will not buy this from Amazon again until their prices drop to compete better with the chain stores that are always around.</li>
      <li>This shampoo works as a great clarifying shampoo - cleans really well</li>
      <li>so I could spend that time on more productive things than driving to the store to walk around and shop for an hour or so, but this hasn&#x27;t convinced me I am able to do that yet.</li>
      <li>Nice clean scent.</li>
      <li>It helps get all that build up off of my scalp and leaves my hair feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>I bought this when I saw the advertisement and thought it was a unique, cool concept and had good experiences with Garnier before with their shampoo/conditioner products.</li>
      <li>I alternate this clarifying shampoo with an anti-breakage shampoo and have seen very good results.</li>
      <li>Smells great and really helps my hair avoid getting oily so quick.</li>
      <li>I had used other Garnier products and had been very happy with them.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair looking and feeling clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not like I have baby fine hair that gets greasy easily.</li>
      <li>After one day, I thought it worked fine.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this stuff for really cleaning my hair!!</li>
      <li>anyways this product is fantastic and was the beginning of my addiction to garnier products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice and it leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>I tried this shampoo because a friend gave me a bottle for free.</li>
      <li>And a pretty package doesn&#x27;t make it any better.</li>
      <li>Clean used together has worked wonders for me...</li>
      <li>I like it when shampoos actually clean your hair and not leave it feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>I bought this Garnier shampoo because I wanted to get my hair CLEAN.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo paired with the Garnier Pure Clean Conditioner.</li>
      <li>I think you have to use more shampoo than normal, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>It works great with my curly/thick hair, it keeps my hair feeling clean 2-3 days after a shampoo, and has never left my hair looking greasy, feeling waxy or smelling funny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s obviously not name brand shampoo, but it&#x27;s mostly biodegradable which is awesome, and while it&#x27;s not magical it gets the job done and leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy, and feeling clean.</li>
      <li>But in good faith, I switched over to the Suave she recommended, my hair kept growing back, and I stopped thinking about my hair.</li>
      <li>I really like it and glad I found it.</li>
      <li>I had used that before and decided to give it a try, but wasn&#x27;t really convinced a shampoo on the market could be so harsh as to cause the kind of hair loss I experienced.</li>
      <li>Oh, and I&#x27;m pretty sure one reviewer was right that hair loss might happen because I did notice that as well.</li>
      <li>I gave it a try thinking it would be great like their other shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is great for Black hair, as we tend to use a lot of product in our hair, without washing it all the time.</li>
      <li>It made my healthy hair damaged, dry, and more frizzy than it already was.</li>
      <li>After washing with this shampoo, my hair was nice and soft,  not dry and frizzy like most shampoos would leave my hair after washing.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I have to leave the bottle open on the shower shelf and that is an accident waiting to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i never washed my own hair because it was such a process and one day i came across this product in walgreens</li>
      <li>I was looking for a more natural cleaner for my hair</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair very clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>Also, people are saying \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot;, which is a separate product, and makes me think that they&#x27;re not reviewing the right one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This shampoo leaves my hair clean, soft and full of body.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t straighten, curl, blow dry or apply heat of any kind.</li>
      <li>this product left my hair so clean and sooo light.</li>
      <li>I went out and bought a different shampoo that day because I couldn&#x27;t deal with even just one more wash with this garbage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all I ever wanted and apparently wasn&#x27;t too much to ask for after all.  :)</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells funny as does the conditioner</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve hurt my fingers many a time trying to get it open.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I ended up using this s/c for a week or more, trying different combos... even mixing the conditioner in with the shampoo to hopefully cut the grease while still conditioning.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be better off washing your hair with dish soap or just sticking your head in the toilet.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;ll just make it more dry and poofy.</li>
      <li>which is exactly what i need for my long, fine, oily hair.  </li>
      <li>I have never in my life experienced such pain from getting a little shampoo in my eyes as I did tonight.</li>
      <li>It felt like someone threw acid in my eye and no matter how much I let the shower water spray on my face and into my eye, the pain would not subside.</li>
      <li>She is Caucasian and said that it made her hair feel really oily.</li>
      <li>and it really works through to the roots that way.</li>
      <li>and i bought it because the price was so reasonable</li>
      <li>This shampoo works really well with my hair type.</li>
      <li>I have had the exact opposite experience, and I have super oily hair to begin with.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve use Suave deep clean shampoo before but it didn&#x27;t seem to help much this time</li>
      <li>But, if you can find this item with the green button on the side, I can tell you that it opens very easily</li>
      <li>I usually use sulfate free products, but find they don&#x27;t seem to totally clean my scalp.</li>
      <li>If the shampoo was in a decent container, I would give it four/five</li>
      <li>The only draw back is that it seems to be a bit drying, just make sure to use a leave in conditioner or something to hydrate your hair if you are using heat tools to style.</li>
      <li>But for responsible adult use, it works exceedingly well for me.</li>
      <li>The green knob on top of this container is attached to the tab that allows the shampoo to pour out.  </li>
      <li>Gets my hair super super clean, so clean that it is naturally fluffy and volumized because there is nothing left over to weight it down.</li>
      <li>I have extremely thick hair and a good balance - not dry, not oily.&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
      <li>Well, I have to say, she did that right thing, and I&#x27;m about to be on my second bottle.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want THREE new Garnier products, and I don&#x27;t want to have to pay a cent for a replacement.</li>
      <li>Currently the only thing that gets my hair super clean without making it too dry.</li>
      <li>When I first used it, I just thought I didn&#x27;t wash the conditioner out well enough because my hair was so greasy.</li>
      <li>When I tried the shampoo for the first time I had mixed feelings about it.</li>
      <li>SLS (sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate) is the usual target of critics, but this contains AMMONIUM lauryl/laureth sulfate is even MORE drying and stripping -- industrial</li>
      <li>Even more excessive quantities of strands came out as I used my wide-toothed comb to style it.</li>
      <li>This shampoo does exactly the opposite</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair and a good balance - not dry, not oily.&lt;br /&gt;Pure Clean used together has worked wonders for me... Many other products, for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair would either dry my hair out or make it oily.  The shampoo foams up really nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  I put in my hair and leave in while I soap up - and it really works through to the roots that way. Rinses out completely and it smells awesome!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo does exactly the opposite it says it does. When I first used it, I just thought I didn&#x27;t wash the conditioner out well enough because my hair was so greasy. So i washed it again and it was still nasty looking and feeling. It took me 20 minutes to straighten my hair because my hair was covered in some greasy film. It normally takes me only 5 minutes to do my hair!!! This shampoo is horrid. My hair is medium weight so it&#x27;s not like I have baby fine hair that gets greasy easily. I went out and bought a different shampoo that day because I couldn&#x27;t deal with even just one more wash with this garbage.</li>
    <li> This product was completely AWFUL. When I got it, it leaked everywhere in the package. It made my healthy hair damaged, dry, and more frizzy than it already was. It just completely dried my hair out and added a bristly texture to my hair as well. The product went in my hair strange. I couldn&#x27;t distrubute it throughout my hair and it was in clumps after a minute. Don&#x27;t get this product unless your hair is outrageously oily. Awful item.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I saw the advertisement and thought it was a unique, cool concept and had good experiences with Garnier before with their shampoo/conditioner products. I was mistake on this one. The other review mentioned the knob on top of the bottle, which I agree is a pain to get open when your hands are wet and I&#x27;ve hurt my fingers many a time trying to get it open. The shampoo smells funny as does the conditioner but it seems like a matter of personal preference. When I tried the shampoo for the first time I had mixed feelings about it. I needed a haircut and assumed the oily, greasy, hanging in strands, feeling heavy was due to needing a hair cut. I had my hair cut and this product still leaves my hair oily, greasy, dirty looking and feeling heavy and generally unwashed. Maybe it&#x27;s the product or maybe it&#x27;s but me but this product did not work me.</li>
    <li> UPDATED May 1012:  I&#x27;m still buying this product.  What I noticed when I bought my last bottle about a month ago, was that that awful green knob is now on the side--not the top--of the container.  It is much easier to open.  I don&#x27;t see an update for this product here at the Amazon website, so I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;d receive if you ordered it from this page.  And that means I&#x27;m not prepared to revise my rating.  But, if you can find this item with the green button on the side, I can tell you that it opens very easily and it is a nice product for fine, thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous review:  The green knob on top of this container is attached to the tab that allows the shampoo to pour out.  It is impossible to open when your hands are wet.  What were they thinking!?!?  The container earns a zero star rating.  Honestly, I have to leave the bottle open on the shower shelf and that is an accident waiting to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using another shampoo that was \\&quot;made\\&quot; for thin, fine hair.  Well, that previous shampoo made my hair look limp, greasy and it hung in strands.  I bought this Garnier shampoo because I wanted to get my hair CLEAN.  It advertises that it will give you \\&quot;stronger, healthier hair with NO WEIGH DOWN\\&quot; and that&#x27;s why I bought it.  It smells nice and my hair is shiny and lighter.  If the shampoo was in a decent container, I would give it four/five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy it, pour it into another container before you take it into the shower with you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.I got it together with conditioner, It made my hair greasy,terrible product. Now I don&#x27;t even want to finish it who would want to have dirty looking hair,total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this garbage. What the heck is it, HORSE shampoo? I used it tonight and got a little bit in my right eye and I literally thought I&#x27;d have to be rushed to the hospital. I have never in my life experienced such pain from getting a little shampoo in my eyes as I did tonight. This was 6 hours ago and I&#x27;m still in pain. It felt like someone threw acid in my eye and no matter how much I let the shower water spray on my face and into my eye, the pain would not subside. My vision in that eye is actually blurry now. I might actually have to go to the doctor for this.I&#x27;m not a complainer and I try to stay away from doctors for every little thing, but this is plain nuts. I&#x27;m going to write to this company and find out what kind of testing--if any--they did regarding eye safety and this crap. This is plain unsafe. And a pretty package doesn&#x27;t make it any better. Stay away from this crap.</li>
    <li> Last year, I lost about 50% of my scalp hair, something I had never experienced before. My doctor ran blood work, examined my scalp, etc., and could thankfully find no medical reason for the hair loss. In fact, my doctor mentioned that I had tiny new hair growing on my scalp. She  did offhandedly mention that some shampoos can be harsh and recommended Suave Naturals. I had used that before and decided to give it a try, but wasn&#x27;t really convinced a shampoo on the market could be so harsh as to cause the kind of hair loss I experienced. But in good faith, I switched over to the Suave she recommended, my hair kept growing back, and I stopped thinking about my hair. I should have taken my doctor&#x27;s words of wisdom more seriously, because just tonight, I picked up a bottle of this Garnier shampoo to use again and was horrified. In the shower, strands upon strands of hair came out in my hand. Even more excessive quantities of strands came out as I used my wide-toothed comb to style it. What in the world is in this stuff? I got curious and looked up the reviews here for other Garnier shampoos and several people mention moderate hair loss after using a Garnier shampoo product. I have a sinking suspicion that this shampoo is to blame for my hair loss, as well. I won&#x27;t take anymore chances with it. Going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff for really cleaning my hair!!</li>
    <li> Left hair feeling dirty, greasy. My hair never clumps, or looks stringy unless I haven&#x27;t washed it for 3-4 days. I used this twice then threw it away. Junk.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo because a friend gave me a bottle for free. She is Caucasian and said that it made her hair feel really oily. Well, I have to say, she did that right thing, and I&#x27;m about to be on my second bottle. This shampoo is great for Black hair, as we tend to use a lot of product in our hair, without washing it all the time. It helps get all that build up off of my scalp and leaves my hair feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> hey, so idky the bad reviews for others but lol it works good for me ! I am guessing because, I have good nice hair ...i have thick healthy but oily when i dont shampoo for 2-3 days, that must be why. sorry didnt work for others but if you have my hair type I would try it ! My hair was so shiny when using this, so when  I am done with my conditioner I am gonna try the conditioner for this one !</li>
    <li> Combine it with the conditioner &amp; in a few days you&#x27;ll have an oily scalp, dry ends &amp; smell like FISH!!! Oh, and I&#x27;m pretty sure one reviewer was right that hair loss might happen because I did notice that as well.</li>
    <li> But the cost was just too expensive. I was hoping I could turn to Amazon for all of my household shopping so I could spend that time on more productive things than driving to the store to walk around and shop for an hour or so, but this hasn&#x27;t convinced me I am able to do that yet. This was way more expensive than in a store, and for a lesser amount of product too. Will not buy this from Amazon again until their prices drop to compete better with the chain stores that are always around.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many negative reviews about it leaving hair oily.  I have had the exact opposite experience, and I have super oily hair to begin with.  This shampoo works as a great clarifying shampoo - cleans really well which is exactly what i need for my long, fine, oily hair.  Gets my hair super super clean, so clean that it is naturally fluffy and volumized because there is nothing left over to weight it down. The only draw back is that it seems to be a bit drying, just make sure to use a leave in conditioner or something to hydrate your hair if you are using heat tools to style.</li>
    <li> I have really long straight hair that is at my knees. I&#x27;ve been really having a problem with my hair being dull and unruly. It appeared to have a residue on it. I&#x27;ve use Suave deep clean shampoo before but it didn&#x27;t seem to help much this time so I thought I&#x27;d change it up a bit and found this. I&#x27;ve used it twice and it leaves my hair smooth and shiny. I really like it and glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, works great.  Leaves my hair looking and feeling clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair very clean and soft.  This is my third bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this shampoo cuts through all the product and product residue on my extreme baby-fine hair. I do not like the container it comes in (I am disabled, with only 1 working hand, so you can imagine the difficulty I would have with this incredibly stupid container design!) but I pour it into a 1-liter pump container and love it. I alternate this clarifying shampoo with an anti-breakage shampoo and have seen very good results. As with any clarifying shampoo, try not to get it in you eyes and do not use on pets or children as it is too harsh should it get into their eyes. But for responsible adult use, it works exceedingly well for me.</li>
    <li> Well, I decided to give this shampoo a try since my regular brand seems to be undergoing a scarcity at the moment. I think Unilever&#x27;s going through a brand change. After one day, I thought it worked fine. My hair&#x27;s really clean and fluffy, which is what I wanted. I like it when shampoos actually clean your hair and not leave it feeling greasy. However, I got the bottle which said \\&quot;pure clean\\&quot;, which I thought meant that it would get your hair clean like normal and not leave it greasy and weighty like 2-in-1&#x27;s or other odd shampoos. I have to say, I like the way it made me feel, but I don&#x27;t like buying organic or \\&quot;biodegradable\\&quot; products. I like ones that work. If it biodegrades, great, but I have to make sure it works and that it&#x27;s safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews on here, I&#x27;m a little confused. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this shampoo not cleaning my hair. I think you have to use more shampoo than normal, but that&#x27;s fine. Also, people are saying \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot;, which is a separate product, and makes me think that they&#x27;re not reviewing the right one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I might return this and get the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; Garnier kind (which is what I thought I was getting with this). There are too many people complaining about this product, so I might stop using it to avoid running in to any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it one day, but I think it made my head burn a little. I don&#x27;t know... it might be my imagination, or maybe it was the weather, or I was much cleaner and drier that day, but it felt like it was a little harsh. After reading other&#x27;s reviews, maybe it was real.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural cleaner for my hair and I&#x27;m really sad to say (If I don&#x27;t like something I won&#x27;t rate it) it was bad enough that I need to let others know.  Maybe its my hair type, but it just wasn&#x27;t good, my hair felt grimy.</li>
    <li> When I received this product, the bottles had all opened in transit causing the rest of the items I had purchased to ether be ruined of covered in shampoo. It was very frustrating to have that happen!</li>
    <li> I have dry and brittle hair and I am allergic to most shampoos/ conditioners. This one worked like a charm. After washing with this shampoo, my hair was nice and soft,  not dry and frizzy like most shampoos would leave my hair after washing. The best part, the shampoo was very gentle on my scalp, no itchy scalp, no breakouts, no dandruff. Best shampoo that I have ever used till date. Though Matrix leaves my  hair in a better condition, I do not dare to use it for what it does to my scalp.</li>
    <li> i must say after reading all these negative reviews i had to say something. i am afican american 22 yr female with thick relaxed hair once a year. i never washed my own hair because it was such a process and one day i came across this product in walgreens and i bought it because the price was so reasonable and i wanted to save money and do my own hair. anyways this product is fantastic and was the beginning of my addiction to garnier products. this product left my hair so clean and sooo light. usually my hair feels weighed down and this was the first time that ever happened.i dont know why some ppl said it made their hair greasy. ever since this product i have purchased every garnier product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for around a year now and have no complaints aside from that it is a bit hard to open in the shower. It works great with my curly/thick hair, it keeps my hair feeling clean 2-3 days after a shampoo, and has never left my hair looking greasy, feeling waxy or smelling funny. It&#x27;s obviously not name brand shampoo, but it&#x27;s mostly biodegradable which is awesome, and while it&#x27;s not magical it gets the job done and leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy, and feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Only gave it one star because negative star reviews are not able to be given.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather wash my hair with an old, previously used bar of soap from a dirty hotel room than use this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and the accompanying conditioner are the worst products I have ever put in my hair. I used this for ten weeks and it damaged my hair horribly. Believe me, this shampoo/conditioner were the only thing I ever used on my hair. I don&#x27;t straighten, curl, blow dry or apply heat of any kind. I don&#x27;t use any styling products and I also didn&#x27;t damage it in the pool or anything. My hair has more than just split ends, it is crinkly and has three or four splits on the end of the hair and it became prone to breaking. I highlight: the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. I do not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Currently the only thing that gets my hair super clean without making it too dry. I love this shampoo and it smells great. I don&#x27;t like the conditioner that this is paired with though (it seems to take moisture out of my hair)</li>
    <li> I saw this shampoo on sale at my grocery store. I had used other Garnier products and had been very happy with them. I gave it a try thinking it would be great like their other shampoo&#x27;s. But it left my hair looking and feeling unwashed. It was so bad I went the next day and bought a new pair of shampoo and conditioner. On top of that it irritated my skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money. You&#x27;d be better off washing your hair with dish soap or just sticking your head in the toilet.</li>
    <li> I too have thick hair that can get oily if not washed every 2 days or so. This shampoo works really well with my hair type. I usually use sulfate free products, but find they don&#x27;t seem to totally clean my scalp. This shampoo leaves my hair clean, soft and full of body.</li>
    <li> We had this on our subscription but every time it ships with other products it opens and gets all over the other contents of the box. I have told amazon and hope they straighten it out. Other companies bag the item.&lt;br /&gt;Love the shampoo. Nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells good, lathers well, and rinses cleanly. It does leave my hair with moisture. The bottle was a little smaller than I was expecting (yes, I realize the number of ounces is advertised), but it has lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> I hated this shampoo and conditioner.  I have long, fine, blonde hair that needs to be washed every other day.  The first time I used the s/c set, I noticed that my hair took forever to dry (it&#x27;s usually dry in 30 minutes through air dry) and my hair was still wet 2 hours later.  It also felt thick, but not like good, luscious &amp; thick, but like it had a coating of junk on it thick.  By the end of the day, I looked like I hadn&#x27;t showered in a week.  It was embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured that I probably didn&#x27;t rinse my hair well enough, so I tried it again the next day.  Same story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third day, I used the shampoo by itself.  My hair definitely felt better than it had with the conditioner, but it still felt heavy, and looked dry and didn&#x27;t feel like my hair.  I will say my hair felt thicker, but I need conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using this s/c for a week or more, trying different combos... even mixing the conditioner in with the shampoo to hopefully cut the grease while still conditioning.  It helped a little, but I was still annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up contacting Garnier, and the customer service was nice and sent me coupons to replace my shampoo with another garnier product.  They sent me 2 $3 coupons and one $1 coupon. Last night I went to the store and saw this new shine spray they have for about $6.50, so I figured I would buy it with my 3 coupons.  Well, the store told me I could only use one coupon per item.  I am calling Garnier back to issue me a $7.00 coupon.  I don&#x27;t want THREE new Garnier products, and I don&#x27;t want to have to pay a cent for a replacement. Ugh.  I&#x27;m annoyed.  I really wanted to like this product because natural shampoos can be expensive....</li>
    <li> if you haven&#x27;t gotten the memo.. sulfate-based shampoos are not good for hair. SLS (sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate) is the usual target of critics, but this contains AMMONIUM lauryl/laureth sulfate is even MORE drying and stripping -- industrial strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dont care about sulfates, that&#x27;s OK, but be warned that this high-strength cleanser is not suitable for colored, processed, overly dry or thick hair-- it&#x27;ll just make it more dry and poofy. Stay away and find a sulfate-free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine, thin, oily hair, you may actually love this because the extreme oil-sucking properties create the illusion of volume.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo paired with the Garnier Pure Clean Conditioner. I have long hair that tends to get oily quick, usually by the end of the day and this shampoo really helps. It foams up nicely and washes out well. Smells great and really helps my hair avoid getting oily so quick. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have stick straight, fine but thick grey hair that is usually flat.  I am always experimenting with different volumizing shampoos and have no idea what possessed me to try this one.  But I am so glad that I did.  My hair is now normal/oily (very oily when younger) also, in case that is helpful to others.  Anyway, now my hair is fuller looking and lays perfectly.  It&#x27;s all I ever wanted and apparently wasn&#x27;t too much to ask for after all.  :)</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO,  I WASH MY HAIR DAILY.  SO IT DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE ANY RESIDUE BEHIND FROM HAIRSPRAY, ETC</li>
