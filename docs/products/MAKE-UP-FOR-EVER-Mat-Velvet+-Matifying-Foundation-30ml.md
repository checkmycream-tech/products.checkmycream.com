      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I think the biggest thing i noticed is how watery the drug store products are, and the coverage isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, but just not as good as I was expecting.</li>

      <li>i will order again more of this when i run out.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>i LOVE this foundation.&lt;br /&gt;i saw a review for it on youtube, so i decided to try it out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i love this foundation better than their hd.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, matches my skin well.  </li>
      <li>If the cosmetic industry can standardize their coloring names so it is easy to find your shade along with provide a pump you can purchase separately if you prefer having a pump.</li>
      <li>Came fast and love the product!</li>
      <li>i get the shade #40, and its great for my light skin with yellow undertones.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve discovered that it&#x27;s hard to find a liquid foundation that caters to my skin complextion as perfectly as Make Up For Ever does.</li>
      <li>As much as I love applying CC cream, there are days I really want the coverage of a foundation.</li>
      <li>It is seriously the best make up I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
      <li>Product was as described and arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>I ended up getting it, although the price is super super steep.  </li>
      <li>now i really need more and this foundation really evens out my skin.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, covers well and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>Wow, what a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>Well i instantly fell in love.  </li>
      <li>and it never looks like i&#x27;ve put on that much, because you don&#x27;t need a lot.  </li>
      <li>everyday looks, i mix this with a BB cream or a more sheer foundation to matte it out a little bit more, and give me more staying</li>
      <li>Now if the price can come down, the labeling can get better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands, but I keep coming back to makeup forever.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brand.  </li>
      <li>makeup artist/hair stylist and im not afraid to try different foundations.</li>
      <li>My complexion is smooth and even (without looking cakey) and it barely takes any of this stuff to cover my entire face.</li>
      <li>This is a completely new experience for me, considering I&#x27;ve been used to re-applying make up over five times a day.</li>
      <li>The cost is high, but you don&#x27;t need a lot, it goes far and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>I am 21, and I have gone through so many different make-up brands to find one that won&#x27;t slide off of my face due to the excess oil my skin produces.</li>
      <li>It gives such a smooth medium coverage that stays put long after others wear off my face.  </li>
      <li>I was wary of color selection based on a little square, but it turned out to be perfect.</li>
      <li>I was a little scared to spend more than drug store prices on my make up but with the scars I have on my face, and the help I received on finding my ACTUAL shade, I will never buy another product for my foundation!</li>
      <li>You are then forced to use more and even layer</li>
      <li>I used to use Bare Minerals, but even that needed touching-up after about two hours.</li>

<li> Not my color and not easy to put on face.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s  a little tube of  concealer!</li>
<li> Because I am a broke college kid, I usually cannot justify spending over $20 on makeup</li>
<li> Maybe my skin&#x27;s just weird, but this never lasts very long on me.</li>
<li> This makeup is thick and a bit hard to blend.</li>
<li> so cant return ,but disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I think i saw this product being used on one of those youtube make up guides.  I ended up getting it, although the price is super super steep.  Well i instantly fell in love.  The coverage is above none and it never looks like i&#x27;ve put on that much, because you don&#x27;t need a lot.  Since then, for reasons i&#x27;m unsure, i purchased some back up foundation at the local drug store.  Wow, what a huge difference.  I think the biggest thing i noticed is how watery the drug store products are, and the coverage isn&#x27;t great.  You are then forced to use more and even layer that with foundation powder..no fun.  I highly recommend this brand.  The cost is high, but you don&#x27;t need a lot, it goes far and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and arrived quickly.  Good seller.  Only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the product isn&#x27;t quite what I expected.  It&#x27;s good, but just not as good as I was expecting. No fault of the seller.</li>
    <li> This matte foundation keeps oily T-zones at bay.    Easy to apply, matches my skin well.  Lasts all day.  Now if the price can come down, the labeling can get better.  If the cosmetic industry can standardize their coloring names so it is easy to find your shade along with provide a pump you can purchase separately if you prefer having a pump.</li>
    <li> Maybe my skin&#x27;s just weird, but this never lasts very long on me.</li>
    <li> what i received is not this stuff, it&#x27;s  a little tube of  concealer! what the hell , i&#x27;m not in US now so cant return ,but disappointed!</li>
    <li> Came fast and love the product! Wish I would have ordered 2-3</li>
    <li> Excellent makeup!!! Makes youe face flawless!!!</li>
    <li> i LOVE this foundation.&lt;br /&gt;i saw a review for it on youtube, so i decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;this foundation is PERFECT for the days when you need a flawless, matte look. i get the shade #40, and its great for my light skin with yellow undertones.&lt;br /&gt;for everyday looks, i mix this with a BB cream or a more sheer foundation to matte it out a little bit more, and give me more staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will continue to purchase this foundation as i have for a few years now.</li>
    <li> i love this foundation better than their hd. it&#x27;s very flawless and goes on smooth.  i will order again more of this when i run out. one of my favorites foundations next to smashbox halo.  im  makeup artist/hair stylist and im not afraid to try different foundations.</li>
    <li> Product it&#x27;s ok. Not my color and not easy to put on face.</li>

    <li> This product complements the concealer and they both work wonderful for me...been using it since 2007.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!! Stays on all day. Perfect matte finish that doesn&#x27;t look greasy for oily skin. I have fair skin and got #25.</li>
    <li> it covers my  splotchy face.  good coverage.  i used to just have to use a sheer foundation.  now i really need more and this foundation really evens out my skin.</li>
    <li> By far, the best foundation I have ever used! I was a little scared to spend more than drug store prices on my make up but with the scars I have on my face, and the help I received on finding my ACTUAL shade, I will never buy another product for my foundation! I hope it isn&#x27;t discontinued, as is my luck!</li>
    <li> I am 21, and I have gone through so many different make-up brands to find one that won&#x27;t slide off of my face due to the excess oil my skin produces. I used to use Bare Minerals, but even that needed touching-up after about two hours. Because I am a broke college kid, I usually cannot justify spending over $20 on makeup (especially when previous experience proves that it&#x27;s just a waste), so I was hesitant to purchase this. But, because I received an Amazon gift card for Christmas, I thought I&#x27;d splurge. It is seriously the best make up I&#x27;ve ever owned! It stays on through my entire work shift and if I want to go out afterwards, I don&#x27;t even have to worry about it! This is a completely new experience for me, considering I&#x27;ve been used to re-applying make up over five times a day. I would suggest this to anyone. My complexion is smooth and even (without looking cakey) and it barely takes any of this stuff to cover my entire face. Love it!</li>
    <li> This foundation is just perfect. For a mattifying product that offers as much coverage as this does, it isn&#x27;t too thick or heavy on my face. I find it lasts through the work day, with maybe a little powder touchup towards the end. I have slightly pink undertones and I&#x27;ve discovered that it&#x27;s hard to find a liquid foundation that caters to my skin complextion as perfectly as Make Up For Ever does. My combination-oily skin just loves this foundation!</li>
    <li> This makeup is thick and a bit hard to blend.</li>
    <li> I read a &amp;#34;best of &amp;#34; in a fashion magazine and decided to buy it from Amazon. It goes on smoothly, covers well and looks very natural. I was wary of color selection based on a little square, but it turned out to be perfect. Great product.</li>
