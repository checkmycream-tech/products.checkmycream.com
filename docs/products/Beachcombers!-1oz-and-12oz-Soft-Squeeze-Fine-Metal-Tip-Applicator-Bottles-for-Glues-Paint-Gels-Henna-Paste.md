      <li>I had gotten into henna for a bit and needed something that was easier to use then a plastic bag, I found this set and it works really well.  </li>
      <li>i really like this squeeze bottle.</li>
      <li>Somebody even wrote the word &amp;#34;enjoy!&amp;#34; in purple ink by hand on the paper, which I thought was a nice touch, very personal and such.  </li>
      <li>Okay, so I am a first time henna buyer, and I was a little hesitant to purchase these from the varying advice given by people about applicators vs. cones.  </li>
      <li>Works fine as long as you leave it upright.</li>

    <li> I use these bottle for storing and applying henna. The henna comes out in nice smooth streams, no clumps. The only thing that is a little annoying is when the bottle is holding a little amount of henna it takes a lot of squeezing to get anything to come out and it starts to hurt the fingers after awhile. Other then that the bottles work great and if need be I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Perfect tools for doing henna art.</li>
    <li> I had gotten into henna for a bit and needed something that was easier to use then a plastic bag, I found this set and it works really well.  Just make sure you have something close by to make sure you get air bubbles out!</li>
    <li> This set has a great assortment of sizes. Make sure your henna isnt very thick or else it will never go through the hole of the metal tip</li>
    <li> These are excellent! Have had these for quite some time now and haven&#x27;t seen any wear or damage on the product very happy with the purchase! Only downsize I&#x27;ve seen with this product is it&#x27;s rather slow to clean them completely so my advice would be to buy two or at least an extra set of tips.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I have used cheaper bottles purchased at hobby stores and none of them hold a candle to this Beachcombers bottle.  It is easy to change out the tips and the flow is excellent.  The henna doesn&#x27;t come out in clumps or globs like with other bottles.  Make sure to wash out the tips after use; they are hard to clean if you let the henna dry in them.</li>
    <li> These little bottles are really useful for anyone into henna.  They make storage and application super easy. The metal tips are durable and haven&#x27;t bent at all. The only downside is that the set doesn&#x27;t come with lids for storing the henna without the applicator tip in place. The best thing I did was put the bottle in a ziptop bag. Works fine as long as you leave it upright.</li>
    <li> I am just beginning to do Henna tatoos and these bottles and especially the tips are a great way to start. The tips come in various sizes so you can play around w/ them until you find the one that works for you.</li>
    <li> These are a great product for a great price. I mix my own henna and they are wonderful little bottles. I also really appreciate that they measure the tips in gauges, a very accurate measuring system.</li>
    <li> My henna skills went up exponentially with this bottle.  i have not tried any other bottles or the cones, but I liked this set up.  Henna almost never clogged.  Could be a little easier to clean and it hurts your fingers as it gets empty, but both of these are expected.</li>
    <li> Compre este kit por las agujas para poder hacer los tatuajes de henna con mayor detalle que con el cono aplicador y poder variar el grosos de la l&amp;iacute;nea sin problema, pero las botellas son un poco duras y luego de un tiempo me canso sobre todo el dedo pulgar, tengo otras botellas que son mas blanditas pero no les funciona la tapa de las agujas. pero en general hacen lo que necesito.</li>
    <li> I really love these bottles. They are exactly what I wanted and are in excellent quality. The only reason that this in not a 5 star rating is that the smaller tips are very difficult to use. It is perfect other than that and I am looking forward to using them all the time.</li>
    <li> This product makes it easy and neat.  Highly effective, with the following corrolary.  YOU MUST STRAIN YOUR FINAL MIX.  Even the heaviest needles will very easily become blocked if you don&#x27;t  The largest needles create very big, thick lines, with a very bold design.  As should be clear by now, I had a problem with the smaller needles because I didn&#x27;t follow the f&amp;^(^*^ instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Product is exactly as described, and works precisely as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love having the different sized tips, and the henna I ordered with it was excellent!</li>
    <li> This is a really great set of bottles for henna.  I&#x27;ve found similar kits that are really expensive, but this one has an awesome price.</li>
    <li> I opened the product, and put the henna in it and put the lid on only ot have the lid crack making it useless! Maybe I just got a bad lid. My dad saw it and ended up throwing it away because it looked like a useless piece of junk, which it was.</li>
    <li> I have always mixed my own henna and used paper cones but I wanted an upgrade. Unfortunately these clog constantly and hurt your hand to use because you have to apply so much pressure to clear the clog. I cut the paper cones with a very small tip likely similar to the .2mm and never had trouble until I got these tips. Even keeping a needle nearby didn&#x27;t eliminate the hassle. Maybe for craft glue or something they would work but not henna tattooing.</li>
    <li> love this set it allow me to practice henna as much as I want  and I love the different sized needles for variety although i usually use one</li>
    <li> Had to learn how to put it in the bottle...but found out that you can use a baggy and squeeze it in the bottle. The nozzles are helpful to make some cute designs. All in all, a great product.</li>
    <li> great for hennah adjustable tips for very fine detail works great very satisfied would buy again or recommend to friend</li>
    <li> Needle variety is perfect for beginners and easy to clean.  This package is a great option for recreational Henna application.</li>
    <li> These are really good applicator bottles. They did what I needed them to do and didn&#x27;t have any problems with them.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of bottles with different size tips. I am a teenager obsessed with henna, and my friends and I decided to make our own and get the bottles with the different tips. We spent our precious money on the bottles and henna powder and oils, and mixed up the powder and put it in the bottles, but they are impossible to use. The henna is hard to come out, especially with the thinner tips, and the bottles really hurt your hands after a while. Good idea, but I&#x27;m not impressed, and wished I spent my money on cones instead.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful henna applicator.the tips work well and its easier to design.i would redcomend this to anyone that does henna.</li>
    <li> I do Henna tattoos at work andlike to draw Henna designs on myself for practice. I like these bottles and tips a little better than the ones we use. Since I&#x27;m use to not having a variety of tips I tend to just use one of the smaller ones. I also prefer using the smaller bottle and refilling more often since you really want o be topping it off with paste as you go. Otherwise your hand will cramp up from squeezing the bottle. My boyfriend says cones are better but I feel that I have more preciscion and control with the bottles. Plus, when you need to fix a line you can just use the metal tip as an eraser.</li>
    <li> The multiple sized metal tips allow you to get different amounts of henna onto the skin, and they are easy to switch out if you decide you want to apply a thinner line. I will be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing henna lately straight out of the cones, which is good or a very traditional Indian henna design. But When I wanted to go into more of a Moroccan style I had to get bottles. And I am so happy I got these. I did the 2 bottle with 5 tips an I&#x27;m happy I went for this combination.&lt;br /&gt;I mostly do designs on myself and am working up my skill to be comfortable with doing it on others. The lines I get from these are fabulous, I like really thin lines so I always use the smallest tip and then just build it from there, but the variety is great.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the 2 bottle set for a beginner but for more advanced artists who are looking to henna a large amount of people, the 4 bottle set would be best because you can put all the tips but one on them and be able to switch sizes more fluently.</li>
    <li> This set of things is generically utilitarian. I have not actually used them but they look nice and I am sure they will work as well as something which is designed to be obsolete in a decade or so.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars because it works beautifully in creating the design. The various size tips helps with small images! my only problem was getting the henna in the bottle!  my henna was very thick, which is what I needed because it was going on a shaved head, moms going through chemo. A little tip, when filling bottles, wear gloves of some sort!</li>
    <li> This is really useful for storing and using henna.  They are easy to use, install on the bottle, and clean.  Great product!</li>
    <li> bought this set to use with an all inclusive kit.  the bottle on the kit had a large hole which made it difficult to draw fine lines.  this works so well with the different size tips.</li>
    <li> i really like this squeeze bottle. its mess free and easy to clean. i especially love the changeable needle tips, it has all the sizes i need. the best part is my package came on the exact date i was told it would.</li>
    <li> This kit works great for applying Henna.  The bottles are easy to fill and the tips come is a great range of sizes.  The price was excellent too.  I have had these for over a year and they are still working great.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I use these bottles and tips for fine-line glitter tattoos.  It came with a pin to block the tip closed... I was unhappy with the fit, but I replaced it with one of my own flat-head steel pins, and it works a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would believe this would be great for something like henna.  The glue I use for glitter tattoos is a little thin, so I have to be careful to not squeeze.  I can see henna coming out of these very smoothly!</li>
    <li> Hard to clean. That&#x27;s the only downside.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I am a first time henna buyer, and I was a little hesitant to purchase these from the varying advice given by people about applicators vs. cones.  But I am so glad I bought these, because I can&#x27;t write with a cone for crap.  First let me say the package is beautiful.  A small plastic baggy arrives with the bottles and a full purchase report.  Somebody even wrote the word &amp;#34;enjoy!&amp;#34; in purple ink by hand on the paper, which I thought was a nice touch, very personal and such.  Even the thinnest tip allowed my henna through without any pause.  They&#x27;re easy to wash and the bottles are fantastic for storage!  I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> We originally bought a henna kit and the bag that was included exploded so we purchased these beachcombers and are thrilled with them!</li>
    <li> They serve their purpose may not be the best product but you get what you pay for.  Try it out...</li>
