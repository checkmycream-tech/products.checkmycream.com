    <li> Great quality for a great price. Speedy delivery. Would buy again. In fact I bought 31 of them for our Women&#x27;s Show Choir.</li>
    <li> This is a cute well made bag. I use it to keep my stuff (mints, lip gloss, nursing pads, etc.) together in my diaper bag since my son can&#x27;t get into zippered bags yet. It looks exactly like the picture and the dimensions are accurate. Love it!</li>
