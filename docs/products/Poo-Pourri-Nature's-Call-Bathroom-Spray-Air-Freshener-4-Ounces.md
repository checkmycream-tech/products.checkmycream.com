      <li>Best smelling Poopourri!</li>
      <li>This is a great product!</li>
      <li>Bought it for my husband to use; it works great for him!</li>
      <li>Poo-pourri is a great product!  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This stuff is great!  </li>
      <li>My movements must be too magnificent for this product.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, this is ORGANIC so you can feel good with this purchase!</li>
      <li>This is a great concept- spray before you go.  </li>
      <li>My family and I have found this product to be a great thing to carry with us on vacation and to keep in every bathroom of the house.  </li>
      <li>smells great.  </li>
      <li>great concept.</li>
      <li>Very nice citrus fragrance.</li>
      <li>Off to order more for the family lav...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it works better than most products</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much more it could be improved.</li>
      <li>If you are going to sip liquid make sure it is secured</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>but surely I knew it was working.</li>
      <li>Lovely fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Nature&#x27;s Call has a citrus scent; I&#x27;ve been trying a variety Poo-pourri fragrances, and this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>This one isn&#x27;t AS good at blocking the smell as the original, but it&#x27;s nice to have a different scent every now and then.</li>
      <li>much more pleasant than traditional air freshener.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d even try it again if they had a more industrial strength product ;)</li>
      <li>The Nature&#x27;s Call fragrance is pleasant and simple.  </li>
      <li>Surprisingly, though, the product actually WORKS.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t smelled any of the other fragrances, but am sure they are just as effective.  </li>
      <li>Requires more frequent cleaning.</li>
      <li>Of course it has quite a powerful odor of its own -- sort of a cross between a perfumed industrial disinfectant and your great Aunt&#x27;s favorite perfume which she puts on in quadruple the needed amount -- but that&#x27;s far, far preferable to the alternative, especially after a meal that&#x27;s not handled particularly well by your (or your guest&#x27;s) GI tract.</li>
      <li>Natural citrus scent, easy to use pump spray, will always have a bottle in the bathroom.</li>
      <li>This product works well in public restrooms and it produces a lovely citrus scent.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was spraying because there wasn&#x27;t that evident film like before,</li>
      <li>This really works!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the original and this one so far and both of them have done what they said!</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works - and has the easiest smell for all types.</li>
      <li>Poo-pourri really works.  </li>
      <li>Totally eliminates any order and the fragrance is so nice that I want to spray my entire bathroom.</li>
      <li>When I revealed to friends how much I liked the product, a few of them admitted that they use it too.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended if used as directed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only halfway through the first bottle, but I don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
      <li>I like that the product works very well, and nearly covers up all odors without spraying chemicals into the air to breathe.</li>
      <li>I have tried a few scents and this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>but then again adding any fruit scent to the bathroom at work (other than the normal bathroom smells) is a huge step up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m keeping in mind that this bottle is only filled with water and essential oils.  </li>
      <li>the package it came in was completely saturated.  </li>
      <li>He really enjoys that the bathroom doesn&#x27;t smell after he goes, especially if someone is coming over.</li>
      <li>The scent is a very clean citrus smell that masks any unpleasant odors but isn&#x27;t too strong like Royal Flush.</li>
      <li>My bathroom smelled like an orange that fell off the tree and right into a cow patty.  </li>
      <li>It barely smells at all and is citrus.</li>
      <li>The spray on this specific bottle was a bit different than the last two as it provides a much finer mist.</li>
      <li>I bought some little spray bottles of this as stocking stuffers at Christmas because the name and commercials are funny.</li>
      <li>The first few times I used it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I leave an extra bottle in the guest bathroom, so that any guest won&#x27;t feel embarrassed after using the toilet.</li>
    <li> I ordered multiple bottles of this and similar products, all in 4 ounces, for Christmas presents. This one came in at 2 ounces; didn&#x27;t have time to return it because it was a gift. So watch out for that.</li>
    <li> I was a little iffy about this product. Bought it for my husband to use; it works great for him! He really enjoys that the bathroom doesn&#x27;t smell after he goes, especially if someone is coming over. Great product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  All my girlfriends carry the purse size to avoid embarrasing moments when out and about.  It is so fab that everyone on my list got a bottle for Christmas!  Off to order more for the family lav...</li>
    <li> This product works well in public restrooms and it produces a lovely citrus scent.  I tried it at work a few times and felt it masked any odors well.... but then again adding any fruit scent to the bathroom at work (other than the normal bathroom smells) is a huge step up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it home and tried it there.  Nope, didn&#x27;t work for me.  My bathroom smelled like an orange that fell off the tree and right into a cow patty.  My movements must be too magnificent for this product.  I&#x27;d say it works better than most products and I&#x27;d even try it again if they had a more industrial strength product ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping in mind that this bottle is only filled with water and essential oils.  Unless they want to start adding chemicals I don&#x27;t know how much more it could be improved.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says. Spray it into the bowl (I found that two sprays is quite sufficient) and it controls those predictably noxious odors very well. Of course it has quite a powerful odor of its own -- sort of a cross between a perfumed industrial disinfectant and your great Aunt&#x27;s favorite perfume which she puts on in quadruple the needed amount -- but that&#x27;s far, far preferable to the alternative, especially after a meal that&#x27;s not handled particularly well by your (or your guest&#x27;s) GI tract. I have one for each toilet bowl in the house.</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance.  Does what it says it does.  Only problem is that the lid tends to come off the bottle in my purse.  Not good.  I keep it in a baggie, but even then, if I don&#x27;t check it daily, the cap loosens.  I would prefer at tighter cap so I can carry it with me without worrying that my entire purse is going to smell of Poo-pourri.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the original and this one so far and both of them have done what they said! This one isn&#x27;t AS good at blocking the smell as the original, but it&#x27;s nice to have a different scent every now and then.</li>
    <li> I have been eagarly waiting for my poo pourrii to arrive. I work on a gi floor at a hospital and wanted to show this to my manager to see if it would alleviate some of our stinky situations.  That chance never came since the bottle that was sent to me was completely empty.  the package it came in was completely saturated.  Seller! If you are going to sip liquid make sure it is secured properly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to contact the seller but never got a response.&lt;br /&gt;Will not be presenting this product to my boss.  You guys totally lost out on a potentially big sell.</li>
    <li> My family and I have found this product to be a great thing to carry with us on vacation and to keep in every bathroom of the house.  It really works.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Totally eliminates any order and the fragrance is so nice that I want to spray my entire bathroom.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product a few years back, and continue to use it.  Definitely an improvement on the various &amp;#34;air fresheners&amp;#34; that are solids or aerosols.  Highly recommended if used as directed.</li>
    <li> Works just as described.  Very nice citrus fragrance.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works - and has the easiest smell for all types. Natural citrus scent, easy to use pump spray, will always have a bottle in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> love it. smells great.  much more pleasant than traditional air freshener.  great concept.</li>
    <li> Poo-pourri really works.  Nature&#x27;s Call has a citrus scent; I&#x27;ve been trying a variety Poo-pourri fragrances, and this is my favorite.  I use it at home and when visiting a public rest room.  A couple of sprays on the water before using the toilet almost always prevents any odor from occurring.  I also have the travel atomizer  [[ASIN:B0017GEFOS POO-POURRI Rhinestone ATOMIZER GIFT SET toilet spray]], which I keep in my purse, and it works well for spraying on the toilet water -- or in the air of a rest room that was smelly when I got there. Poo-pourri is a great product!  I&#x27;m back to order my second bottle of this frangrance from Amazon.  I&#x27;m only halfway through the first bottle, but I don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
    <li> This is a great concept- spray before you go.  The Nature&#x27;s Call fragrance is pleasant and simple.  I haven&#x27;t smelled any of the other fragrances, but am sure they are just as effective.  Also, I like that this ingredient list is literally: water, organic lemon, orange and grapefruit oils.  There&#x27;s nothing complicated about this product and it covers any and all embarrassing odors left in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> This really works!  I have tried a few scents and this is my favorite.  It barely smells at all and is citrus.</li>
    <li> This is now my 3rd scent of Poo-pourri to try (also tried Heavy Doody and Royal Flush) and although it still doesn&#x27;t beat Heavy Doody this comes in a close second. The scent is a very clean citrus smell that masks any unpleasant odors but isn&#x27;t too strong like Royal Flush. I only complain about the overpowering smell because I have a compact bathroom. The spray on this specific bottle was a bit different than the last two as it provides a much finer mist. The first few times I used it I didn&#x27;t think it was spraying because there wasn&#x27;t that evident film like before, but surely I knew it was working. Best of all, this is ORGANIC so you can feel good with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I like that the product works very well, and nearly covers up all odors without spraying chemicals into the air to breathe. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this citrus flavor. It hasn&#x27;t left any marks in the toilet either. We&#x27;ll be keeping these in all our bathrooms from now on.</li>
    <li> Leaves oily ring in bowl. Oily ring turns dark. Requires more frequent cleaning.</li>
    <li> I bought some little spray bottles of this as stocking stuffers at Christmas because the name and commercials are funny. Surprisingly, though, the product actually WORKS. Now, I have bottles in all the bathrooms. When I revealed to friends how much I liked the product, a few of them admitted that they use it too. No need for shame, folks! As the children&#x27;s book says, Everybody Poops.</li>
    <li> Made my bathroom odors WORSE!  Wife ran out of the bedroom.</li>
    <li> Best smelling Poopourri! And it works!</li>
