      <li>I feel confident in my purchase.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with my gut because I LOVE the smell of this oil.</li>
      <li>I love plant therapy oils.</li>
      <li>Love this brand too.</li>
      <li>I love how many uses it has.</li>
      <li>I have a lavender plant and another, more premium, brand of oil</li>
      <li>I use it in my bath for a more relaxing feel.</li>
      <li>Love this company.</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>I love this oil and will buy more from the company again.   </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Lavender - what more can I say??  </li>
      <li>Nice clean scent</li>
      <li>but this oil is good for SO many things that I go through it really fast.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sound asleep in 15 minutes max</li>
      <li>I mix lavender oil with frankincense oil and coconut oil for a fantastic anti-inflammatory treatment.  </li>
      <li>medicinal, kind of chemically, and almost like lavender mixed with like a synthetic pine/ cyprus kind of thing.</li>
      <li>Funny thing is lavender is not my favorite smell</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic, and is pure!</li>
      <li>What I particularly appreciate about this company is their sensitivity to kid safe oils.&lt;br</li>
      <li>In a minute or two the odd smell disappeared and my skin felt great.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be back for more!</li>
      <li>The lavender smells so fresh.</li>
      <li>Nice to have a bigger bottle too, since I use it so often!</li>
      <li>My favorite lavender oil is from a farm in Mendocino county California and isn&#x27;t widely available, but this comes in a close second.</li>
      <li>Nice herb notes unlike commercial lavender &#x27;scents&#x27;, not perfumey at all.  </li>
      <li>virgin coconut oil as deodorant, put it directly on acne and abrasions, mix with manuka honey &amp; put it on healing wounds, apply to soles of feet for wellness &amp; so much more.</li>
      <li>I have bought other lavender essential oils and this is one of the best.</li>
      <li>I  like the fact that you know if the oil is kid safe, major plus for me</li>
      <li>Thanks Plant Therapy!</li>
      <li>will be buying more from Plant Therapy in the future!</li>
      <li>I was pretty skeptical, but, I&#x27;m very happy with the price and the company.</li>
      <li>It has to be my favorite essential oil.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The quality is compatible with many top expensive brands but it&#x27;s more reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>And the fact that it is organic and such a large size for the price is even better.</li>
      <li>authentic tea tree is supposed to smell, &amp; i firmly believe it is the finest, 100%, unadulterated organic tea tree oil.</li>
      <li>and I can tell you this smelled exactly like both and seems to work as well as the one I had before for a much lower price.</li>
      <li>Lovely scent, smells exactly like other higher priced, MLM brands.  </li>
      <li>You know the ones, they&#x27;re all about points and diamond clubs and orders by a certain date.</li>
      <li>regular kind smells exactly like the lavender wands I make from my Provence plants, only concentrated.</li>
      <li>I researched plant species and the fact that this is organic helps me to feel perfectly fine using it daily on our whole family.</li>
      <li>They have very high quality oils at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>This oil arrived very well.</li>
      <li>This really the oil</li>
      <li>Maybe because its a real scent and not chemically created.</li>
      <li>and they were very quic to respond.</li>
      <li>I use lavender constantly with two young children as it&#x27;s safe for them and so powerful, we diffuse it for sleep and even during the day to calm my nervous, sensory sensitive child,  add it to a carrier and put it on small cuts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend to new users of EO&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I had been using high quality Tisserand essential oils for its therapeutic properties for more than 20 years but decided to try other brands to see if I could make some savings.</li>
      <li>Very high quality product - will definitely purchase again.  </li>
      <li>My 5 year old like  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by them.</li>
      <li>I agree with a couple of others that this stuff smelled STRANGE when I first opened it.</li>
      <li>I have tried it on my very wild 3 year old and it does not seem to help calm him down.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve bought many brands of 100% lavender essential oil, usually organic:</li>
      <li>I also rub my 11-months old feet and back with it too at night and he falls asleep within 15 minutes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent Quality.This is a keeper. I use this &amp;#34; neat&amp;#34; on my skin and trust it for everything. I&#x27;ve bought into both of the big MLM&#x27;s before. You know the ones, they&#x27;re all about points and diamond clubs and orders by a certain date. Somehow the oil seems to get lost in the expensive marketing. This smells wonderfully, I see excellent results on my skin and with it&#x27;s calming abilities. I researched plant species and the fact that this is organic helps me to feel perfectly fine using it daily on our whole family. I appreciate not being pressured or cheated. If Plant Therapy expands their Organic line, I won&#x27;t need anything from the &amp;#34;gruesome twosome&amp;#34; of MLM&#x27;s ever again and will be fully at peace with that choice.</li>
    <li> I love plant therapy oils. I am working on replacing all of my stash as they run out with these oils. The lavender smells so fresh. I just love it.</li>
    <li> I have bought other lavender essential oils and this is one of the best. My favorite lavender oil is from a farm in Mendocino county California and isn&#x27;t widely available, but this comes in a close second. I use lavender constantly with two young children as it&#x27;s safe for them and so powerful, we diffuse it for sleep and even during the day to calm my nervous, sensory sensitive child,  add it to a carrier and put it on small cuts. It&#x27;s disinfecting and cleansing powers are well known and have yet to fail me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people said this does not smell like lavender. I have a lavender plant and another, more premium, brand of oil and I can tell you this smelled exactly like both and seems to work as well as the one I had before for a much lower price. Thanks Plant Therapy! I will definitely be back for more!</li>
    <li> highest quality and affordable</li>
    <li> Great quality oil! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Best value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving Plant Therapy oils. What I particularly appreciate about this company is their sensitivity to kid safe oils.&lt;br /&gt;As a former young living distributor I was pretty skeptical, but, I&#x27;m very happy with the price and the company. I&#x27;d definitely recommend all of their products to a friend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fabulous, I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with Plant Therapy. They have very high quality oils at a reasonable price. I was skeptical at first. But I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by them. They are my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brand now. This Lavender oil is no exception. I use lavender in everything. I diffuse it, I wear it neat, I wear it in a diffusing locket around my neck, I put it in my homemade hand soap...  I love how many uses it has. It&#x27;s calming, helps with sleep, repels bugs, helps with colds, it has antibacterial properties and so much more. This really the oil I&#x27;d recommend to new users of EO&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I agree with a couple of others that this stuff smelled STRANGE when I first opened it. I&#x27;ve used other lavender oils (Aura Cacia, DoTerra, Glory Bee) and this one was different. But I had a sunburn that needed tending so I mixed it with a carrier oil and slathered it on. In a minute or two the odd smell disappeared and my skin felt great. When I walked back into the room where I had mixed it later, it smelled like the sweetest lavender. I took a star off for the odd initial smell, but everything else about the oil is working for me.</li>
    <li> Love this company. I  like the fact that you know if the oil is kid safe, major plus for me</li>
    <li> It automatically gets four stars just for being lavender, but I have to say that I don&#x27;t like the fragrance of the organic as well as the regular lavender I&#x27;ve been getting from Plant Therapy for the past few years. It&#x27;s lighter, and...sweeter, and just not as lavender-y.&lt;br /&gt;The regular kind smells exactly like the lavender wands I make from my Provence plants, only concentrated. This one smells like it comes from a different variety, perhaps.</li>
    <li> Funny thing is lavender is not my favorite smell but this oil is good for SO many things that I go through it really fast. I used to actually hate the smell but it seems like I can tolerate it as an essential oil. Maybe because its a real scent and not chemically created. It is a pleasant oil that mixes well with almost anything. Love this brand too.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> VERY happy with this purchase and the quality of the oil. I use it in my bath for a more relaxing feel. I used it in making my own makeup and it made it smell wonderful. I also use it on my sons cradle cap and it seems to ease his itchiness and heal his skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more from Plant Therapy in the future!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, I love it!</li>
    <li> This oil arrived very well. It smells fantastic, and is pure! I love this oil and will buy more from the company again.   There were no leaking issues, the label is very detailed. I feel confident in my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good product, nice aroma!</li>
    <li> works great for asthma and calming</li>
    <li> Great value!  It&#x27;s Lavender - what more can I say??  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Nice clean scent and it&#x27;s organic. Perfect.</li>
    <li> good god don&#x27;t buy this stuff, please! it doesn&#x27;t even remotely smell like lavender oil&#x27;s bastard cousin twice removed. i&#x27;ve bought many brands of 100% lavender essential oil, usually organic: Now, Mount@in Rose Hrbs &amp; Body Bli$$. i have been using Plant Therapy&#x27;s organic tea tree oil for years and absolutely love it; i mix it with orgnc. lavender and orgnc. virgin coconut oil as deodorant, put it directly on acne and abrasions, mix with manuka honey &amp; put it on healing wounds, apply to soles of feet for wellness &amp; so much more. Plant Therapy Organic tea tree oil is wonderful, smells exactly like authentic tea tree is supposed to smell, &amp; i firmly believe it is the finest, 100%, unadulterated organic tea tree oil. so i can&#x27;t understand what in the H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEY STICK is going on with this oil that is supposed to be 100% lavender! when i opened it i put it directly on my wrists, as i so often do with lavender &amp; it immediately smelled much different than any other i have ever smelled: medicinal, kind of chemically, and almost like lavender mixed with like a synthetic pine/ cyprus kind of thing. i only used a couple of drops and although i immediately knew i&#x27;d be returning it, i also wasn&#x27;t so disgusted that i felt i needed to wash it off. an hour after applying it i was scavenging my house looking for some terrible piece of plastic that surely recently came as packaging in a box or something like that because there was this putrid, yet some how familiar smell following me around my house. then i smelled my wrists... it was the lavender oil, it ACTUALLY got worse! DO NOT BUY THIS LAVENDER OIL!</li>
    <li> I mix lavender oil with frankincense oil and coconut oil for a fantastic anti-inflammatory treatment.  This is a consistently excellent product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very good.  Had a question for them and they were very quic to respond.</li>
    <li> One of the best lavenders I&#x27;ve ordered so far. Smells beautiful and works great! I put a couple drops on my feet at night and I&#x27;m sound asleep in 15 minutes max</li>
    <li> I love lavender! It has to be my favorite essential oil. I like to mix it with almond oil and rub it on my face before I go to bed at night. I also rub my 11-months old feet and back with it too at night and he falls asleep within 15 minutes. I have tried it on my very wild 3 year old and it does not seem to help calm him down. I need to find something more for him. My 5 year old like  this rubbed on her feet at night and it helps her sleep at night too. Plant therapy is a great brand and this is a great deal. I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t order this because of the reviews that said the smell was horrible and unlike any lavender they had ever purchased. I&#x27;m glad I went with my gut because I LOVE the smell of this oil. And the fact that it is organic and such a large size for the price is even better. Soon as it came I opened it and rubbed some on my daughters mosquito bites from the night before. Swelling instantly went down. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I had been using high quality Tisserand essential oils for its therapeutic properties for more than 20 years but decided to try other brands to see if I could make some savings. I like this oil. The quality is compatible with many top expensive brands but it&#x27;s more reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this lavender! Nice to have a bigger bottle too, since I use it so often!</li>
    <li> Lovely scent, smells exactly like other higher priced, MLM brands.  Nice herb notes unlike commercial lavender &#x27;scents&#x27;, not perfumey at all.  Very high quality product - will definitely purchase again.  I love Plant Therapy!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the quality and smell.</li>
