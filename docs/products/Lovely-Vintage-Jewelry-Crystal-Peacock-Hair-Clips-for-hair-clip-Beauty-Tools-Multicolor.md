      <li>These hair clips are beautiful, the picture doesn&#x27;t do them justice.</li>
      <li>Good color combination which can go with almost any colors of outfit for any occasions.</li>
      <li>This hair clip is even more beautiful in person, and surpassed my expectations.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>The company is wonderful to work with they told me to keep the item they sent and they are sending out the right item.</li>
      <li>Absolutely beautiful, bigger than looks in the picture, totally love it!!!</li>
      <li>So I saw this silver barrette and thought the colors were amazing.</li>
      <li>Good size appearing on most hair styles.  </li>
      <li>It is really nice looking and well made.</li>
      <li>It is even more beautiful in real!</li>
      <li>I will have to make sure if I want to take a risk if I ever deal with this seller, or this type of product from Amazon again.</li>
      <li>The clip&#x27; s design is just as lovely as shown, but instead of getting the colors ordered, I received pinks and purples with two bluish, not quite aqua stones.</li>
      <li>I love all of the peacock barrettes, but all I wear is silver jewelry, not gold.</li>
      <li>It was really cheap though, so that seems appropriate</li>
      <li>Cute, shiny, but really cheap looking.</li>
      <li>My sisters both loved it so much I had to order them each one</li>
      <li>Rating 2 stars only because the design is beautiful, though these colors that were sent do no justice to the piece.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>the stones seem securely set on that part.</li>
      <li>The shape and color are true to the picture.</li>
      <li>Also, the piece has a good weight to it that&#x27;s necessary for my thicker-than-thick hair.</li>
      <li>Medium to thick hair will work great with this clip, though!</li>
      <li>The clip looks very nice on dark colored hair.</li>
      <li>I had to wait about a month to get them, but they are definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>It takes a while to receive it but it is worth the wait.  </li>
      <li>Will update if and when I get the right item.  </li>
      <li>but if I fix it just right</li>
      <li>Amazon is working on getting me the right one.  </li>
      <li>I order some of these hair clips and they are so pretty, not only pretty well worth the money, I will order more for the girls in my family</li>
      <li>However, I thought I was getting this exact barrette, and I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Had to wear it the very next day :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so pretty and looks exactly like the photo.</li>
      <li>I really like this hair clip!</li>
      <li>It would cost more to ship it back that it cost to purchase.</li>
      <li>It is nice but not exactly what I thought I ordered.</li>
      <li>We all have long, thick hair and this clip holds it securely and beautifully.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I have thin hair but this clip does a good job of keeping my hair in place.</li>
      <li>but i was pleasantly surprised when it came way prettier than pictured!</li>
      <li>On the barrette I got, five are pink, two are red, one is light blue ... and three are a hideous yellow cheap-citrine color.</li>
      <li>No green, no purple, no dark blue.</li>

<li> No green, no purple, no dark blue.</li>
<li> the eleven stone \\&quot;feathers\\&quot; shown in the picture, three are pink, two are green, two are light blue, two are dark blue, and two are purple.</li>
<li> The clip is smaller than I expected and all the stones are blue, not multi color as pictured.</li>
<li> Though the size is smaller than what I expected.</li>
<li> Therefore, I expected to the crystals to be the same as the picture.</li>
<li> I have very thin, fine hair</li>
<li> If the seller reads this and gives a hoot, then send me the correct piece, AS SHOWN, and a return shipping label if you want the other piece back, and I will amend this review.</li>
<li> It was a let down to open package and it not be what I ordered.  </li>
<li> I usually make a french twist with my hair and attach the clip to it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little heavy for my hair</li>
<li> This item arrived and when I opened the package I was amazed at how heavily constructed this is.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll hot-glue the broken \\&quot;feather\\&quot; back on.</li>
<li> so if you&#x27;re worried about it being weighed down, it is somewhat heavy for thin hair but it is manageable.</li>
<li> It works well with my hair, which is on the thick side.</li>
<li> This barrette does not suit for girls who have very thick hair like me.</li>
<li> The one I did get, though, is already broken - two hours out of the packaging!</li>

    <li> This hair clip is even more beautiful in person, and surpassed my expectations. It works well with my hair, which is on the thick side. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I love all of the peacock barrettes, but all I wear is silver jewelry, not gold. So I saw this silver barrette and thought the colors were amazing. However, I thought I was getting this exact barrette, and I didn&#x27;t. The one I did get, though, is already broken - two hours out of the packaging! And I hadn&#x27;t even worn it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the eleven stone \\&quot;feathers\\&quot; shown in the picture, three are pink, two are green, two are light blue, two are dark blue, and two are purple. On the barrette I got, five are pink, two are red, one is light blue ... and three are a hideous yellow cheap-citrine color. No green, no purple, no dark blue. And one of the yellow ones came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep it, since it cost practically nothing. I&#x27;ll hot-glue the broken \\&quot;feather\\&quot; back on. The peacock itself is well-formed and the stones seem securely set on that part. Also, the piece has a good weight to it that&#x27;s necessary for my thicker-than-thick hair. But this matches a lot fewer articles of clothing than I thought it would ... I wanted the colors in the picture! Oh well!</li>
    <li> Its just as described in the pic! It is even more beautiful in real! I suggest buying this item. Quality is very good!</li>
    <li> The clip is smaller than I expected and all the stones are blue, not multi color as pictured. It is nice but not exactly what I thought I ordered.</li>
    <li> This item arrived and when I opened the package I was amazed at how heavily constructed this is. It is really nice looking and well made.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical about the quality because of the low price but i was pleasantly surprised when it came way prettier than pictured!</li>
    <li> I order some of these hair clips and they are so pretty, not only pretty well worth the money, I will order more for the girls in my family</li>
    <li> I really like this hair clip! It&#x27;s so pretty and looks exactly like the photo. It&#x27;s a little heavy for my hair but if I fix it just right it&#x27;s fine. I have very thin, fine hair so if you&#x27;re worried about it being weighed down, it is somewhat heavy for thin hair but it is manageable. Medium to thick hair will work great with this clip, though!</li>
    <li> Cute, shiny, but really cheap looking. It was really cheap though, so that seems appropriate</li>

Rating 2 stars only because the design is beautiful, though these colors that were sent do no justice to the piece.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for myself and I have gotten a lot of compliments on it.  Everyone loves the shine and color of the stones.  My sisters both loved it so much I had to order them each one so they would leave mine alone!  We all have long, thick hair and this clip holds it securely and beautifully.  I had to wait about a month to get them, but they are definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful, bigger than looks in the picture, totally love it!!! Had to wear it the very next day :)</li>
    <li> I love this in the picture but they sent wrong item.  Amazon is working on getting me the right one.  It was a let down to open package and it not be what I ordered.  Will update if and when I get the right item.  The company is wonderful to work with they told me to keep the item they sent and they are sending out the right item. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here and the quality was so-so.  Even for the low price, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> The colors of the crystals in the picture are not what I received. There wasn&#x27;t anything, at the time of ordering, that said the colors of the crystals may vary. Therefore, I expected to the crystals to be the same as the picture. It bought to go with a specific dress and now it doesn&#x27;t match the dress. I&#x27;ll either have to use it with a different outfit or gift it to someone else. It would cost more to ship it back that it cost to purchase.</li>
    <li> Good size appearing on most hair styles.  Good color combination which can go with almost any colors of outfit for any occasions.</li>
    <li> These hair clips are beautiful, the picture doesn&#x27;t do them justice.</li>
    <li> It takes a while to receive it but it is worth the wait.  Very pleased.</li>
