      <li>Please note, this product is best for short hair.</li>
      <li>Pricing is excellent here on Amazon as well as it&#x27;s 25% compared to my local barber shop!</li>
      <li>Sure.</li>
      <li>Products like AC Forming Cream, AC Fiber, and TIGI wax tend to do much better with hair types like mine that need to be tamed during styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is so perfect; it began teaching trigonometry at a local junior college.</li>
      <li>And best thing is the price that came up with the subscription deal in Amazon amazing with free shipping, came right on time or may be a day earlier!!.</li>
      <li>It did not allow any kind of useful styling or adjustment before it had set.</li>
      <li>However, the hold is not as strong as he would like it to be.</li>
      <li>I love this hair product and this two pack is tremendous value for money.</li>
      <li>Not anymore with the help of this fantastic bottle of confidence.</li>
      <li>and I got the genuine product I ordered in 5 days.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find this on Subscribe and Save, because this is truly one of our must-have products at home.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a bunch over the years, but American Crew is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>It Endurance Gel\\&quot; works better and doesn&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
      <li>He thinks Garnier Fructis Style \\&quot;Bold</li>
      <li>exactly as advertised  packaging was secure delivery was</li>
      <li>Overall pretty good buy.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, one of the few hair gels that is water based.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s probably worth your time to check out.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite hair gel.  </li>
      <li>It was recommended to me by a hair-stylist at a salon when I told him that I can&#x27;t find the right hair-gel for me.</li>
      <li>The consistency and scent of the gel was not what I have experienced after several years of using this same product.</li>
      <li>but when his hair is dry it has no scent, which is nice as not to compete with his cologne.  </li>
      <li>has more of a musky smell to it for some reason; other than that, it is fine</li>
      <li>I just signed him up for a every 3 month subscription and love the extra 15% savings!</li>
      <li>I think one 15 oz bottle is going to last for a year or more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve paid quite a bit more for the same product at stores like Ulta and Target.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Asian, and like many, I have coarser, thicker, stiffer hair.</li>
      <li>He is a very low maintainance kind of guy but likes to look well groomed and professional.  </li>
      <li>After originally using this product when I started spiking my hair, to trying 4 other \\&quot;firm hold\\&quot; products while attempting to save money, this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>However, a little bit of water will wash it away very quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>I have short, soft, straight Asian hair prone to fly away.</li>
      <li>Bottles are rather large for travel.</li>
      <li>scent is mild enough to ignore but is distinctly \\&quot;masculine\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>This hair gel works very well indeed.</li>
      <li>I suppose this works for those seeking the perpetual just-hopped-out-of-the-shower look, but it really doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>Also seems like a real man&#x27;s hair gel</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t need much of this gel.</li>
      <li>, I did use much too much.</li>
      <li>With that much gel, I could shape my hair into almost any shape I wanted.</li>
      <li>It just stayed locked in that style for 3 days even after much shampooing.</li>
      <li>This product may not be too good for people with thick hair though.</li>
      <li>gel seems to wash out cleanly with shampooing but see my later comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and yet holds firm.  </li>
      <li>I have returned to American Crew as it fits my needs best, even if it is more expensive than a lot of the other brands.</li>
      <li>your hair starts to grow out, it becomes more and more difficult to use this product.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>However, the price per ounce is high.  </li>
      <li>If u are looking for a gel that gives u a firm hold and easy styling I highly recommend it .</li>
      <li>a side note, I bet this would work well for people with thinner, more malleable hair looking to slick it.</li>
      <li>I have thick black hair and this works great for me.</li>
      <li>The minimal shine, strong hold, and non-flaking of this product definitely deserves 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hard to get anything that smells and holds better without flaking after drying all day.</li>
      <li>He likes it so far.</li>
      <li>The large benefit I have seen in this hair gel compared to others is NO DRY HAIR GEL residue left in the hair.</li>
      <li>It seems to be the same gel, or close enough, but will order a different gel next time because I just don&#x27;t like the huge squeeze tube.</li>
      <li>So I usually use the Light Hold Gel and bought this by mistake.  </li>
      <li>As a frequent traveller, flying out at 5:30am, and not getting to my next destination until after midnight some days, this gel keeps my hair spiked all day and without flakes.</li>
      <li>I have thin hair on top and thicker on the sides.  </li>
      <li>It works fantastic with men who have thick hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product to style the hair and it works for most of the day, the one down side is if you have too much activity throughout the day the gel may fail you at some point.</li>
      <li>Well, let’s just say this cowboy is never lonely at the local disco.</li>
      <li>He simply applies a quarter size, distributing evenly throughout, let it air dry completely then runs his fingers through to loosen the hold a bit.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Using this product for more than 2 years. It was recommended to me by a hair-stylist at a salon when I told him that I can&#x27;t find the right hair-gel for me. Either they make my hair too hard with the spikey look or are just too soft to hold my thick hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works best in terms of optimum strength and the wet look. Amazon&#x27;s is good considering the price of $27 for a two-bottle pack...lot cheaper than most of the salons. But you need to keep checking as the price at Amazon keeps varying a lot.</li>
    <li> After originally using this product when I started spiking my hair, to trying 4 other \\&quot;firm hold\\&quot; products while attempting to save money, this is by far the best. As a frequent traveller, flying out at 5:30am, and not getting to my next destination until after midnight some days, this gel keeps my hair spiked all day and without flakes. I have returned to American Crew as it fits my needs best, even if it is more expensive than a lot of the other brands.</li>
    <li> I got this gel for my husband. He likes it so far. It has a nice smell and does add some volume to his hair. However, the hold is not as strong as he would like it to be. He thinks Garnier Fructis Style \\&quot;Bold It Endurance Gel\\&quot; works better and doesn&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, one of the few hair gels that is water based. This means that it keeps the scalp moist. I have tried a lot of different products but this is the best of the lot.</li>
    <li> My husband uses only this gel.  Shop around for a while and find out that   the best price is through amazon.com subscription.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a sucker for buying whatever my hair stylist recommend for me.  I&#x27;ve used paul mitchell gel, tea tree, and finally ended up using the generic gel products from Sallys Beauty salon.  This was a big mistake.  By the end of the day, my hair was turning white with flakes and falling all over the place.    The minimal shine, strong hold, and non-flaking of this product definitely deserves 5 stars.  I&#x27;ve even put this on a subscription so that I never run out of this!  Just buy it!</li>
    <li> The product inside was not what was expected. The consistency and scent of the gel was not what I have experienced after several years of using this same product. Not sure what happened.</li>
    <li> I am a monthly buyer of this product.  I have looked for a hair product that would keep my husband&#x27;s hair in place while giving it a great style.  It works fantastic with men who have thick hair.</li>
    <li> This hair gel works very well indeed. It doesn&#x27;t take much product to style the hair and it works for most of the day, the one down side is if you have too much activity throughout the day the gel may fail you at some point. The large benefit I have seen in this hair gel compared to others is NO DRY HAIR GEL residue left in the hair. This has become my everyday hair gel.</li>
    <li> My husband has been useing this hair gel exclusively for at least 10 years.  I think this is the best gel for men&#x27;s hair on the market because:  1)It has a  pleasant smell while applying but when his hair is dry it has no scent, which is nice as not to compete with his cologne.  2)It has a firm enough hold to hold his thick hair but does not give it a wet look.  3)It has a moveable hold (no helmet hair).   4)One of the few firm hold gels that does not look flakey.  He simply applies a quarter size, distributing evenly throughout, let it air dry completely then runs his fingers through to loosen the hold a bit.  He is a very low maintainance kind of guy but likes to look well groomed and professional.  I just signed him up for a every 3 month subscription and love the extra 15% savings!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve paid quite a bit more for the same product at stores like Ulta and Target. This is the best price I&#x27;ve found and with the free prime shipping, it makes it even better.</li>
    <li> They send me big bootle which I con not take with travel pack. I was needed small bootle. ................ I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s that you say? Got a case of the blues due to poorly styled hair? Not anymore with the help of this fantastic bottle of confidence. With a properly styled mane, you’ll be the talk of the town, Honky Tonk. It worked for me. My hair is so perfect; it began teaching trigonometry at a local junior college. And me? Well, let’s just say this cowboy is never lonely at the local disco.</li>
    <li> On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is not noticeable and 10 is like granite hard, I would rank this at a 7.  I have had more firm holds before, but the problem with that is it is  impossible to run your hands through your hair without pulling your hair out.  I like the firm nature of this but if I need to soften it up a bit I can by running my fingers through my hair.  It does leave a sticky residue on your hands if you do not wash your hands after applying.  However, a little bit of water will wash it away very quickly and easily.  I would buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this one for a while.  I can just spread it on my hands and rub into my hair.  It holds all day.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Great hair gel and holds hair like its supposed to but makes the hair really stiff and hard.  I&#x27;ve used other hair gels which didn&#x27;t make the hair so hard.  Theres enough hair gel here to last a few months.  Overall pretty good buy.</li>
    <li> Nice gel. I am not sure if it is the best available in Amazon, but I can assure you this is the best of what I&#x27;ve ever used.     The only problem is, 2 packs could be too much for an ordinary person unless you have to use it 4 times per day. So you might as well consider but a one pack version.</li>
    <li> It has been the perfect gel for controlling the hair I  have left. Started using it, along with other American Crew products,&lt;br /&gt;for the past couple of years..</li>
    <li> Excellent  exactly as advertised  packaging was secure delivery was timely price was fair in fact this may have been the best experience I have ever had</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Smells great.  Not too sticky.  Doesn&#x27;t flake.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Please note, this product is best for short hair. I have short, soft, straight Asian hair prone to fly away. I wanted something that would set my style after blow drying or whatever. There are plenty of products that will hold a style,  but this one works the longest, has excellent texture and is flexible all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild enough to ignore but is distinctly \\&quot;masculine\\&quot;. I find that annoying when I first apply it. Eventually, it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel seems to wash out cleanly with shampooing but see my later comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As your hair starts to grow out, it becomes more and more difficult to use this product. The gel is too thick to work into medium length hair and apply it evenly from root to tip.  You either apply too little or too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, I did use much too much. With that much gel, I could shape my hair into almost any shape I wanted. Curls? Sure. Mohowk? No problem! It was sticky until dried into a plastic-like mass.  Brushing softened the texture of my hair so it wasn&#x27;t like a helmet. But nothing could change the \\&quot;set\\&quot; of the hair. It just stayed locked in that style for 3 days even after much shampooing. BTW, there was no apparent residue after shampooing. I was unable to detect any \\&quot;leftover\\&quot; gel in the hair. The style just stayed on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need much of this gel. I think one 15 oz bottle is going to last for a year or more.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite hair gel.  Holds great throughout the day, smells fine and no flaking.  Can&#x27;t find a better men&#x27;s hair gel yet.  Also seems like a real man&#x27;s hair gel compared to all those teenage gels out there.  You also see this brand also at salons but Amazon seems to have a great price.</li>
    <li> I love Crew products, but I was disappointed with my results with this gel, at least for my hair type. I&#x27;m Asian, and like many, I have coarser, thicker, stiffer hair. Despite this product&#x27;s name, it probably has the weakest hold (at least initially) out of any gel I&#x27;ve ever used. All it managed to do to my hair was to clump it together. It did not allow any kind of useful styling or adjustment before it had set. After it had dried, it just turned brittle. I suppose this works for those seeking the perpetual just-hopped-out-of-the-shower look, but it really doesn&#x27;t do it for me. Products like AC Forming Cream, AC Fiber, and TIGI wax tend to do much better with hair types like mine that need to be tamed during styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I bet this would work well for people with thinner, more malleable hair looking to slick it. Also, it smells manly.</li>
    <li> Excellent gel for men that is durable, doesn&#x27;t get flaky and is high quality. Pricing is excellent here on Amazon as well as it&#x27;s 25% compared to my local barber shop!</li>
    <li> Apparently American Crew changed the package from a squeeze bottle to a tube.  The tube is not as convenient as the bottle in my opinion, and harder to travel with.  It seems to be the same gel, or close enough, but will order a different gel next time because I just don&#x27;t like the huge squeeze tube.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband who has used it for years. He says it works so well he is not interested in using, or even trying, anything else.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair gel out there, and the only one I use.  I&#x27;ve used a bunch over the years, but American Crew is by far the best.  No residue at all, and lasts long without being greasy.</li>
    <li> This gel leaves your hair in place, but doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky or with flakes.  However, the price per ounce is high.  This product may not be too good for people with thick hair though.</li>
    <li> Tried other cheaper products - but keep coming back to CREW for the price and availability it&#x27;s hard to get anything that smells and holds better without flaking after drying all day.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this on Subscribe and Save, because this is truly one of our must-have products at home. My husband has curly hair and this is his every-day taming solution. Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  He loves it! It is the only product he will use.</li>
    <li> So I usually use the Light Hold Gel and bought this by mistake.  This is definitely FIRM HOLD, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for it&#x27;s probably worth your time to check out.</li>
    <li> Great gel for your hair.  I have thin hair on top and thicker on the sides.  It keeps it in place without feeling weird.  Good gel for a dude.</li>
    <li> crew has very good alchol free product. Use just a little to add shine and control wild or thinning hair..Paid half the price you would find this item in salons.</li>
    <li> 2 - 15.2 oz. Bottles for $26.99 vs. best local price for 1 - 8.7 oz. bottle for $13.99? Do the math Great Price and I got the genuine product I ordered in 5 days.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I feel good using it. No falkiness like it happens in most of the brands. And best thing is the price that came up with the subscription deal in Amazon amazing with free shipping, came right on time or may be a day earlier!!. So go for it.</li>
    <li> I have thick black hair and this works great for me. The price is good comparing to some others that does not work as well.</li>
    <li> If u are looking for a gel that gives u a firm hold and easy styling I highly recommend it .</li>
    <li> Same tough hold on hair, but I noticed that this new set of gel smelled differently than previous bottles I have used of the same type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has more of a musky smell to it for some reason; other than that, it is fine</li>
    <li> This hair gel is the best.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply and yet holds firm.  It doesn&#x27;t have a really nasty after-effect once it dries either.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product and this two pack is tremendous value for money. Bottles are rather large for travel.</li>
