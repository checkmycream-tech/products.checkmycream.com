<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just all her passport fragrances.</li>
    <li> Excelente me encanta, llego en perfecto estado!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Reminds me of summer by the beach!</li>
    <li> My son bought this perfume for me for Mothers Day last year and Ive used up 2 bottles since. I get compliments pretty much where ever I go on how good I smell. Its not expensive and smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> I love the Paris Hilton perfumes I have smelled, except Fairy Dust. That is just the worst. Old lady stench, bleh. I read some reviews and watched a youtube review by The Fragoholic, and really wanted to try this one out. One reviewer said it smelled like beer and fruit, which I can kind of see how they could describe it that way haha. But to me this smells very nice, sweet and fresh. And bright, if that makes sense. It smells like strong, sweet flowers and some citrus-y fruit to me. And I do not like floral scents normally. I was pleasantly surprised by this and will be wearing it a lot in the summer! It is a very pretty scent. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I can&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;beer and fruit&amp;#34; description out of my mind haha but it really is nice! It is not too expensive either, so if you like Paris&#x27;s other perfumes like the original Paris Hilton and Heiress, I would try this. I have Can Can and just ordered Siren and Passport in Paris, which I will do reviews on!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect parfum for young girls.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and I ended up using it.  I like floral scents, beachy scents, and this combines them both beautifully.  I love this perfume and it is now one of my regulars.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t believe I bought this. But a co-worker had this one and it smelled great. Its a really good price and it came packaged just fine. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> The price it&#x27;s very good, the smell last for all day. I will recomend. To all thank you. Can&#x27;t  beat the price</li>
    <li> I love this smell and I am so not a PH fan.  The only issue was that I walked in Marshall&#x27;s and found it for $7.99.  Oh well:)</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I have almost all Paris Hilton perfume collections. I am not a fan of Paris Hilton but I do love all her signature fragrances collections. This one has mild staying power and the smell is extremely flattering. I don&#x27;t mind having to spray couple of times during the day. Can be worn Spring/Summer seasons. With this price you  can&#x27;t beat it. This is my everyday perfume along with Paris Hilton Paris and Paris Hilton Tokyo. I highly recommend Passport Paris, Can Can, Passport Tokyo, Passport Southbeach, Paris Hilton by Paris Hilton the original one and Tease. I plan on buying Heiress Perfume later one.</li>
    <li> I just love this light refreshing scent, and I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> excellent product as it appears on the page and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more attentive to Cart</li>
    <li> I love this scent for the summertime.  It&#x27;s not too overpowering but does catch your attention in a suddle manner.  I&#x27;ve been complimented on it&#x27;s aroma every time I wear it.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Big bottle for a good price. I like this smell. Only thing is it doesnt last all day like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> My buddy smelled this on a singer at a club as she walked past our table. He loved it. So I asked the performer what she had on. This was it. Then I ordered the scent - and give to my friend to give to his wife. How that finally played out &#x27;tween them has not been revealed................</li>
    <li> Upon spraying this for the first time I noticed - it reeks like beer and fruit, as if someone mixed their Budweiser with cosmo mix. If you can get past that, it&#x27;s overtly floral and nothing exceptionally different from an average floral. Average staying power. Nothing but average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free so I can&#x27;t say it was a big loss. The bottle is cute but the art is just a label and if you tote this around then it will start to peel. Be wary and try a tester first.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece for her birthday and I had to get it for myself. It smells great and captures attention. People will ask what you are wearing. It is a light scent</li>
    <li> Great smell for women and great price. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Big bottle, good price. Smells very elegant</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, i go through several bottles (big, small, purse) like crazy and very fast. I wear it all the time and get the most compliments..hands down best perfume out there...This arrive quickly and wrapped safely, i recommend you guys buy this perfume. I have been wearing it for years now and will always be my favorite.</li>
