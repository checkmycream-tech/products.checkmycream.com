      <li>It has a nice smell and goes on easily.</li>

      <li>I love the pump bottle</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
      <li>This retinol hyaluronic serum has a revitalizing effect on my skin, and I also appreciate that it does not have the sometimes sticky feel that many serums tend to.  </li>
      <li>My favorite part is they give you a 365 day satisfaction guarantee.</li>
      <li>: Make sure to use a sunscreen when using retinol, as it will make your skin more susceptible to burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>

      <li>It is safe for all skin types.  </li>
      <li>Light floral smell is nice.</li>
      <li>Retinol, when used on the skin, increases the production of hyaluronic acid and collagen, making skin smoother and more supple.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>

      <li>and it is excellent when it comes to retaining moisture on my perpetually dry skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and more even in tone.</li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth. :)</li>
      <li>also love that the company is cruelty free.</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s been keeping my skin clear, smooth, and looking great.</li>
      <li>I have used retinol before and this is very mild.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and does not leave your face feeling sticky after it dries.</li>
      <li>of the reasons why I have grown to love Amara Organics (besides the fact that they have phenomenal skincare products) is because they only use the best, natural plant-based ingredients available, with no parabens, no alcohol, and no animal testing!  </li>
      <li>I first liked about this formula</li>
      <li>It can improve the firmness of the skin, reverse the signs of aging and environmental damage, treat acne and reduce wrinkles, fine lines and hyperpigmentation.</li>
      <li>With this product you will notice the fine lines and wrinkles practically disappear.</li>
      <li>I got this because I have fine lines around my mouth and between my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed that my fine lines are getting finer, and my skin seems to tighten, am I 20 again?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Retinol has been used for years by Dermatologist. I used RetninA when I was a kid for acne, so when I found this product without going to the DR?! Yes I was going to purchase it. I have discoloration and lines for living in central America and being in the sun every day. After expensive peels and scrubs I tried this (going back old school) and wow it has taking my discolored patch on my forehead away and made my lines less visual.</li>
    <li> Amara Organics has become one of my favorite skincare brands so I was beyond excited when they sent me their Retinol Serum to review for my blog, GlamRiver!&lt;br /&gt;Since I am now in my 40&#x27;s I think Retinol is a VIP (Very Important Product) in my skincare routine.  For me using Retinol means fewer lines &amp; wrinkles, reduced breakouts, smoother skin texture and less hyperpigmentation and a healthy glow.  I apply this Retinol Serum to my entire face, around my eyes, down my neck and on my decollete.&lt;br /&gt;Retinol helps repair skin by stimulating collagen and speeding up skin cell turnover and revealing new skin.  Which is exactly why you should really only be using Retinol as part of your evening skincare routine.  The last thing you want to do is expose that delicate new skin to the sun which could end up having the opposite effect that you are trying to achieve, it can make you age faster!  You need to protect that new skin so make sure you are applying a sunscreen during the day while you are treating your skin with any Retinol product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons why I have grown to love Amara Organics (besides the fact that they have phenomenal skincare products) is because they only use the best, natural plant-based ingredients available, with no parabens, no alcohol, and no animal testing!  LOVE, LOVE &amp; LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product complimentary or at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
    <li> Amara Organics Retinol Serum has improved the texture and tone of my skin drastically in just over a week of using this product. I apply it at night after my regular facial cleansing regimen, just a little bit goes a long way as well. It absorbs quickly and I then apply my moisturizer before bed. I naturally feel fresh and airy when I fall asleep but to my surprise I continued to have that fresh feeling throughout the entire day. After a few days of using Amara Organics Retinol Serum I was washing my face that evening, same as I always do, but when I looked up into the mirror I almost screamed. All the fine lines around my eyes and lips were almost gone. I didn&#x27;t have very deep wrinkles and lines to begin with but, wow!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doing a great job on my few age spots and I&#x27;m going to keep using it. Retinol is one of the top dermatologist recommended products for anti aging and skin repair! It works better the longer you use it so I&#x27;m going to keep going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that the company is cruelty free. It&#x27;s important that products I use don&#x27;t harm others (especially a beauty product). I can feel confident that I can do something great for my skin with an all natural product that is safe for myself and was created safely.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft and glowing. The serum is not greasy and has no smell. It&#x27;s very gentle on your skin and has all natural ingredients. I previously bought way more expensive serum but this one seems to work as good.  I use it once a day and I&#x27;m hoping it will help with my age spots (didn&#x27;t see the improvement yet but i have been using it just for over a week). So far so good!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and no greasy feel to the product. I&#x27;ve never used retinol before so I was a bit skeptical at first. No adverse effects and fragrance was great. You won&#x27;t be sorry for the purchase!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this retinol serum because it is reasonably priced and it did not cause my face to break out or have crazy redness that I have had from prescribed retinols. You do have to use a high SPF sunscreen daily. That is very important! I like that it is organic. It has a nice smell and goes on easily. I use it and then use a good night time moisturizer, along with a weekly exfoliator. I use it every other night and have noticed a brightening in my skin tone. I have been using for about a month and am seeing my crow&#x27;s feet start to minimize. I know from past experiences that it takes a couple of month with retinols to see a difference. But you have to ensure you are regularly using them.</li>
    <li> This serum has a lot of excellent ingredients! After cleansing, I apply it to my face and neck, allowing it to dry completely. I follow up with my moisturizer that contains SPF because retinol can make your skin more susceptible to sunlight. Because Retinol can make your skin a little red, when you first begin using it, I recommend using this product every other day for the first week.  It absorbs quickly and has a pleasant smell, I have been using it for about a week now, and I have noticed that it greatly helps with the dark circles under my eyes and my skin looks so much better. It has a nice, thin consistency, which I like, because I feel like it penetrates my skin more efficiently. I received this during a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. Since I began using this, my skin is firmer, smoother, truly moisturized and most importantly, my large pores are beginning to shrink! This Amara Organics Retinol Serum with Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid and many other skin boosting vitamins and minerals is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to others! Thanks for reading my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this product.  It is not greasy, and absorbs fairly quick.  I appreciate a pump bottle, as it makes apply so much easier.  Apply after cleansing and toning skin.  Allow product to dry before applying moisturizer.  Since this does have retinol in it, be careful while out in the sun, as retinol is known to increase chance of sunburn.  I have used other Amara Organic Products and found them to be just as useful as this serum.  As a review blogger, I received this at no charge, I am under no obligation to write a positive review.</li>
    <li> This always makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I had an interesting experience with a happy ending.  When my Retinol Serum first arrived in the mail from Amazon, the glass bottle had broken in transit and all the serum had spilled out.  I reported this feedback to Amazon.  The next day, Jennifer from Amara Organics contacted me by email and promised to send me a replacement bottle immediately at no charge.  My replacement bottle arrived well-packaged and I was able to begin using it right away.  I am happy to report that this is a good product.  As recommended, I use it at night after cleansing.  The serum has a pleasant smell, is lightweight and non-sticky and spreads smoothly over the skin, and best of all, my skin looks clearer and brighter even after just 2 days.  I have barely any wrinkles, but I do have uneven skin tone.  After the improvement that I have seen thus far, I am really excited about this product and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Until not too long ago, retinol serums either had to come from a dermatologist or from extremely expensive spas. Or you could also pay an arm and a leg to get it online. Thankfully now there&#x27;s a retinol serum that&#x27;s not only over the counter, but is inexpensive to boot! You&#x27;d think maybe it wouldn&#x27;t work as well as some of those high end designer brands, but trust me, it does. I had a bottle of retinol that I got from SkincareRX that was $95 and it didn&#x27;t work as well as this. This doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel sticky- it goes on really lightly and absorbs immediately into the skin. I love the pump bottle so you get just the right amount and don&#x27;t waste it. I also love that it&#x27;s a dark bottle so the active ingredients don&#x27;t get degraded by light. Bonus that it also includes Hyaluronic Acid for extra moisturizing. This makes your skin smooth and really evens out dark spots, bumpiness and scaring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: Make sure to use a sunscreen when using retinol, as it will make your skin more susceptible to burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it at a Discount for my Review</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks before writing anything on this product since I&#x27;ve never used Retinol before. For the first two weeks, I only used it every other day to get my skin used to it, so I didn&#x27;t really see any difference. I&#x27;ve been using it almost a month now and I&#x27;m starting to really see a difference. It&#x27;s not an overnight fix, but my pores/blackheads are slowly shrinking. Something I&#x27;ve struggled for YEARS with. I&#x27;ve tried so many other products that worked to a certain point and then stopped. This is the clearest I&#x27;ve ever seen this area. If you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix this may not be for you, but if you&#x27;re willing to give it a time I&#x27;d say give it a go. With the money back guarantee you&#x27;d got nothing to lose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did receive this product for free for a review on my blog. However, I was not asked to post on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. I&#x27;m dealing with melasma and fine lines, and using this product in combo with a brightening serum has really made a difference! Not too drying like other retinol products.</li>
    <li> I have never tried a Retinol Serum until now, and believe me when I say that I have been missing out.  I have dry dry skin, and when I get acne its not a pretty sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting older so that means more wrinkles and my skin isn&#x27;t as tight as it use to be.  I have been devastated because it has hit me that I&#x27;m not young anymore lol.  Well this Serum does many things to improve my face.  The dryness that I have, well no more, it leaves my skin soft and smooth, the acne that I get every now and then, it help clears it right up and reduces the redness, the wrinkles, fine lines, and not so tight skin, well it started to fade away.  I have noticed that my fine lines are getting finer, and my skin seems to tighten, am I 20 again? No but it was backed down some of the aging happenings in my face and helped in a lot of areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I had this years ago, i&#x27;m not a doctor but I feel like if I had started using this years ago, my face would have been a lot more healthier looking than it is now.  I completely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.**</li>
    <li> I just love the products from Amara Organics!!! I&#x27;ve purchased the Hydraulic and the Retinol Serums and I love them both!!!! when you purchase the products you always get a PERSONAL email from Jennifer Thompson, who is the co-founder of Amara!!!! I&#x27;ve never had this type of experience before.  I hope to see some new and exciting products from them in the near future.  Kudos to Amara!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this serum about a week ago.  I&#x27;ve used it every night and so far I can see some visible improvements in my skin.  Pores are a bit tighter and my skin looks brighter.  Looking forward to seeing further results with continued use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 46 year old woman who has struggled with hormonal acne and acne scarring for a few years. I have tried so many different products and nothing worked. My hormonal acne was effecting my self-esteem and making me depressed. The Retinal Serum is the FIRST product that has ever really worked for me. My skin is absolutely amazing. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all. I would actually like to get a refund somehow. It seems some of these reviewers were paid. It made me break out a little, and it didn&#x27;t make my skin look any better at all. I&#x27;m doubtful there&#x27;s even retinol in this, I&#x27;m doubtful of the entire ingredient list, except aloe, because it obviously has that, due to the color of the liquid.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount for my unbiased opinion.  I have a scar on my eyebrow and decided to see if it would help it smooth out and be less noticeable than it appeared.  I used it and will continue to use it, as I have noticed a small change.  I also used it on my crow feet around my eyes and deep wrinkles.  It is working and does not take much.  It has been about two weeks and I did notice them less.  I will also continue to use..can&#x27;t wait to see what a month will do!!  I would recommend for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I notice much of a difference with my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks now.  I don&#x27;t hate it but I don&#x27;t love it.  I won&#x27;t throw it away but I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.  I ordered it because of the positive reviews but I truly believe that people are paid and the company tells them what to write as an endorsement.</li>
    <li> Great product, good for acne.</li>
    <li> So far this serum is making my skin brighter and more youthful.  I have only been using it for about a week and feel a difference.  I also us Oleavine anti-aging moisturizer and like the results from both.  You really have to let this dry down before you apply your moisturizer or you can feel a little warming sensation.  I find if I let it dry down completely, I do not have that issue.  Then again, it makes me think it is working;)  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Retinol is just too intense my usage. Maybe once a week would suffice. Only 76% organic ingredients makes the Brand name a bit deceptive.</li>
    <li> This product has helped soften fine lines and even reduce pores.  I have been using this with their vitamin C serum, eye gel and moisturizer and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, it works slowly and gradually.  Makes your skin brighter and even tone. When you apply it at night,  in the morning your face is refreshed instead of looking tired. 4 stars because it takes a few weeks to see measurable change.</li>
    <li> Made me break out terribly. Sent back for a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple days and have already noticed very very slight improvements on the tone and texture of my skin. I really hope it continues to improve my skin and I hope I don&#x27;t age too quickly! I have already recommended this product to many friends and family and this is definitely a re-purchase item for me! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I need a fewore weeks to see results. Ty!</li>
    <li> Just started using this about 2 weeks ago and I can see a decrease in the deeper lines in my face.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this seems to work the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. Less drying and harsh than Retin-A and it&#x27;s been keeping my skin clear, smooth, and looking great. I would definitely recommend this. Great price too.</li>
    <li> this product works great! !!!!</li>
    <li> I have received my Retinol 2.5 serum, I decided to use it to help me with my bags under my eyes to help with bag. So far it is helping me tighten them up, the oil gel absorbs in fast and drys quickly to. It comes in a nice pump bottle and it comes out nicely, I&#x27;m excited to see how I do in weeks to come.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy using this product.  I use it on my face, neck, and hands to be proactive in managing and maintaining healthy skin.  This retinol hyaluronic serum has a revitalizing effect on my skin, and I also appreciate that it does not have the sometimes sticky feel that many serums tend to.  Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful serum! Gives my face a youthful glow. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or break out my sensitive skin. Love that it&#x27;s organic. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I noticed a difference on my face after about a week. I am going to reorder.</li>
    <li> I like this very much.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin feeling nice and fresh, and I have not noticed any issues, problems or concerns. I can&#x27;t rate it well, because the info says results will vary and are not immediate. I do have confidence in the product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This serum has brightened my skin and smoother after the first use.</li>
    <li> I have used many serums, but all of them are pretty expensive. I have a pretty tight budget and pretty sensitive and problematic skin so I am always on the hunt for an affordable product. I have scars from cystic acne on my chin so it always looks like I&#x27;m broken out even when I&#x27;m not. (My dermatologist has explained to me this is hormonal and I will be stuck with breakouts on my chin once a month for the rest of my life). This serum is not drying and seems to moisturize a bit. I haven&#x27;t been using it for long, but I do feel like this serum is starting to lighten up the scars. I also feel like my skin is a bit tighter. Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product and price.</li>
    <li> Although I do not use this every day, I still see noticeable result when I apply this product. I also use the C Serum and the Hyluronic Acid. Just make sure to stay out of bright sunlight.</li>
    <li> I have fine lines On my forehead and when I started using this product they are starting to become less noticeable.  My skin feels smooth. :)</li>
    <li> Really like this product and find that it has definitely made a difference in how my skin looks.  I use a different Amara serum in the morning and this one at night.</li>
    <li> I could see fairly fast results with Amara Retinol. I am always looking for something that is not super expensive and very effective for wrinkles. I am very happy that I found this product and tried it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this Retinol Serum!  After just a few weeks, I&#x27;m definitely seeing an improvement in my aging neck.  But the BEST part of all is the incredible customer service at Amara Organics!  The company always goes waaaaay beyond the norm to provide a 5 Star experience with every purchase I make.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s too soon for a review but I just wanted to say that this serum really brightens my skin. So far so good.</li>
    <li> It took a little over a month for this product to clear up a persistent&lt;br /&gt;rash on my face, which flares up every year during pollen season, but now&lt;br /&gt;my skin looks clear and soft. The difference is really amazing. Pollen&lt;br /&gt;count is  still high, but the rash is gone. This is the first product that has&lt;br /&gt;actually cleared up my rash, after trying many others over the years.&lt;br /&gt;I feel the Serum also has&lt;br /&gt;improved the texture of my skin. Great product. I&#x27;ll keep using it&lt;br /&gt;year-round.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse</li>
    <li> Nice slip, absorbs quick, not overly drying. I alternate with hyloronic acid serum. Love both!</li>
    <li> I saw results after just one night. My skin is smoother and clearer! I put it on after washing my face and then put a facial moisturizer on over it. It dries super fast too so you don&#x27;t need to wait to put the moisturizer on right after.  It says to wear sunblock because of increased sun sensitivity. I always wear sunblock on my face anyway, so I didn&#x27;t experience any sun sensitivity. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone worried about the appearance of their skin. Whether it be wrinkles or acne or dryness.</li>
    <li> I am always reading articles or seeing commercials on tv talking about Retinol as new anti-aging formula. So, I decided to give it a try. I happily received a this Retinol Serum at a special price for the purposes of product testing and reviewing. It is a great opportunity for me to see how well it works for me and to share my finding with you here in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I first liked about this formula was that it was a serum and not a cream. It has been my experience in the past that serums tend to have a higher concentrate of ingredients than regular creams. Therefore, you are getting the most bang for your buck!  Plus it was a pump dispenser which means no contamination and less waste. Already I am loving this Retinol serum. Plus it is 99% Natural and 72% organic, meaning there are no unnecessary ingredients that could potentially be damaging to my sensitive skin. Speaking of sensitive skin, this Retinol serum went on smooth, had little to no smell, dried quickly and did not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used this serum steadily day and night, I starting seeing a general improvement in my skin&#x27;s overall health. What little acne I did have was gone, simply because it unclogged my pores. In my opinion I find this serum to be an excellent antioxidant, diminishing fine lines and wrinkles. The general appearance of my skin tone had evened out considerably. Plus not only is there Retinol in this serum but it also contains Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin E, both of which are excellent moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results of this Retinol serum. All statements are my honest opinion of how this Retinol serum worked for me and I would, without a doubt recommend this serum to other women. It brought back my skin&#x27;s youthful glow!</li>
    <li> This product really does work.  Do it regularly and you will diffinitly see great results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an animal activist so I&#x27;m thrilled that this is vegan! I like the smell and the consistency. It&#x27;s too early to tell yet if it is helping my wrinkles but I have had no peeling, drying, or irritation. I wake up with soft, supple skin. I will add more to the review in a few weeks!</li>
    <li> This is a good Serum, I have seen improvements in my dark spots / fine lines, the price is very good for its quality. I apply it gently around the eyes and it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product!!! I read the instructions it came with and it worked just as it says. I would highly recommend this. I noticed results fairly quickly and right in line with what the instructions indicated. Wonderful, high quality product!</li>
    <li> I got this because I have fine lines around my mouth and between my eyes.  I have pretty good skin for my age. I am 44 yrs. old. I have used very expensive skin care and drugstore brands.  I started using this 2 days ago. It goes on like a serum, but non-greasy. I was a little nervous, as I have sensitive skin.  I have used retinol before and this is very mild. I tried it out on my hand at first. This has no scent and I had no irritation at all. I am using it morning and night on my fine lines. Use this sparingly. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot and it will last you a long time. . I will update in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> My new favorite serum. It goes on nice and dries flawlessly. No greasy, sticky residue. I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no difference after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Not everyone knows that when ingredients are natural or organic, it is absorbed much more effectively by our skin than any chemical would be.  This serum contains a natural blend of Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Vitamin E—very nurturing for our aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other products that I’ve tried that promise instant results, you end up with a shiny face, sometimes with a light powdery white residue over which you cannot apply makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was non-irritating to my sensitive skin, and was a less pronounced look to the crow’s feet around my eyes and a tightening of pores on my forehead.  It’s not designed as a stand-alone product, so when paired up with a good anti-aging moisturizer, fine lines and wrinkles are minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes 2 squirts to cover my whole face.  I even have a tiny bit left to apply to my hands so that they look their best as well.</li>
    <li> Retinols are the only beauty ingredient with studied and proven results. They&#x27;re designed to improve skin texture, fade spots and improve wrinkles. I read about them and watched Dr. Oz&#x27;s shows on Retinols and couldn&#x27;t wait to try some! This serum is fantastic. I&#x27;ve already noticed a reduction in spots I have from breaking out, and a slight fading in the brown patches I have from pregnancy. It&#x27;s made of high quality ingredients! The company&#x27;s website says that they are committed to the highest quality organic ingredients, it&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free. So overall I have sensitive skin. I have been using this every other day and have not noticed irritation. It&#x27;s gel-like and has zero fragrance. When I opened the bottle I noticed a slight smell of witch hazel, which is among the great ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;  Ingredients include:  Ingredients include; Deionized Water, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (Botanical Hyaluronic Acid), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Triticum Vulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Wildcrafted Resina Propoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Organic Gotu Kola Extract, Organic Horsetail Plant Extract, Organic Geranium Extract, Organic Dandelion Extract.&lt;br /&gt;  I can&#x27;t wait for the benefits to continue! While this does require me to wear sunscreen during the day (it increases skin sensitivity), this is an easy task to complete since I have already been wearing sunscreen for years to prevent wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;  Disclosure; I received a product sample to facilitate my review, however the opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
    <li> I had the chance to try this new wonderful product for free. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. It looks greasy at first but as it drys it is not greasy at all. A wonderful and affordable product.</li>
    <li> Light and silky formula takes very little to cover your entire face. It doesn&#x27;t make your face oily or not moisturize enough. It is perfectly balanced. Light floral smell is nice. I love the way it feels!</li>
    <li> I know that it has not been 12 weeks, but my skin has dramatically improved. The first week my acne started clearing. Deeply clogged pores are coming to the surface. I can manually remove gunk that has been too deep to touch previously.  My skin is smooth and more even in tone. I am a tiny bit dry which is unusual for my oily skin. No biggie, I just bumped up my daily moisturiser. No flaking or burning. I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in the next few weeks!</li>
    <li> After receiving this product I have discovered a new favorite serum. All the ingredients in this product are great and work perfect for me. When first using this I noticed there was no heavy scent which is great. It is easy to use and does not leave your face feeling sticky after it dries. I highly recommend this product. Great buy.</li>
    <li> This serum works great at turning back the hands of time.  It is scientifically proven to produce results.  This serum works and continues to work the longer you use it. In as little as 12 weeks you can reduce fine lines, wrinkles and skin pigmentation.  Over the past few year I have noticed those fine lines on my face and I no longer have that young youthful glow.  With this product you will notice the fine lines and wrinkles practically disappear. I have mild acne and retinol is effective at treating it.  Also, it can help fade acne scars.  It is safe for all skin types.  My favorite part is they give you a 365 day satisfaction guarantee. What is not to love about this product. *received for testing and review.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid thirties and I am a big skincare and anti aging aficionado. I&#x27;m asian and I am often mistaken to be a lot younger than my actual age - but that does not mean that I can slack on taking care of my skin. I love Amara Organics&#x27; Retinol Serum with Vegan Hyaluronic Acid because I have proven over the past few months that it truly works on my sensitive skin, it eradicates the tiny fine lines I have on the sides of my nose and it is excellent when it comes to retaining moisture on my perpetually dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid is a naturally occurring substance in our body that regulates skin/cell renewal and lubricates connective tissues - maintaining the skin&#x27;s moisture and elasticity. When used topically on the skin, it creates a moisture barrier and helps make it smoother and softer. It is an awesome ingredient with amazing benefits for dehydrated skin. It is also very safe to use on sensitive skin, as hyaluronic acid is naturally present in our bodies, making it a safer alternative to synthetic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol, on the other hand, is an active form of Vitamin A molecules. It is a powerful exfoliant that encourage the skin to shed dead/problematic layers and turn over younger and healthier cells. Retinol, when used on the skin, increases the production of hyaluronic acid and collagen, making skin smoother and more supple. It can improve the firmness of the skin, reverse the signs of aging and environmental damage, treat acne and reduce wrinkles, fine lines and hyperpigmentation. Amara Organics&#x27; Retinol Serum with Vegan Hyaluronic Acid is effective, made of quality ingredients and priced well. It is truly worth purchasing and checking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

    <li> I am in week one of using this product and with what has happened so far, I am truly excited!!  I am experiencing a little irritation (dryness, redness),but so worth it as ALREADY my fine lines are not as pronounced and blemishes are totally clearing.  The results are supposed to increase week by week, with max results showing at the 12 week mark- I am already noticing a difference!!!</li>
