      <li>It works really quickly on your face.</li>
      <li>This soap is good and it is pretty big</li>
      <li>Okay, I needed a natural soap, I first used the rdl papaya soap, which I liked and it was natural,</li>
      <li>Although my order got lost in transit, the seller was kind enough to send a replacement !</li>
      <li>I was going to make a new purchase, then, I saw this popped up under related soap, I saw it had good reviews and decided to try this instead.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and it&#x27;s great for evening out skin-tone and getting rid of blemishes.</li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast</li>
      <li>so I was hoping to lighten the areas for a more uniform appearance when wearing short sleeves.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
      <li>My skin feels really smooth and clear.</li>
      <li>Love this soap didn&#x27;t see results til soap was low..</li>
      <li>It is a big bar, so it will not melt easily and it last longer then most soaps.</li>
      <li>Since its a rather large sized soap, I cut it in chunks so that it lasts longer and use what I need.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really work for ME......</li>
      <li>this lightened my complexion fast.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast too.</li>
      <li>I really see results</li>
      <li>but, my complexion isn&#x27;t really lightning up.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin soft and to me it is very clarifying!</li>

      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>Unlike many other Filipino whitening soaps I&#x27;ve tried, this one actually gets rid of pimples when I use it at night and helps lighten my freckles.</li>
      <li>Just hoping it goes away completely !</li>
      <li>The bar is pretty big</li>
      <li>Make sure you use a white towel because this soap will lighten dark color towels.</li>
      <li>Do just what it say clear complexion</li>
      <li>it really works, I have only been using this product for 3 days</li>
      <li>The only con about the product is that it runs out fast.</li>
      <li>If your looking for something to rid your face of pimples and you have sensitive skin like myself</li>
      <li>Soap have done nothing for my skin so far i ordered based on reviews.</li>
      <li>I have been using one bar of soap since early August</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s early October</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sorry, but this is my honest review.</li>
      <li>It does dry your skin though so make sure you moisturize, i use coconut oil just because I don&#x27;t want any other lotions to mess with the process.</li>
      <li>I am dark skinned and have really stubborn skin that&#x27;s why I am so ecstatic that this has been working.</li>

    <li> this lightened my complexion fast. use moisturizer afterward.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I asked for and it works great. I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and it&#x27;s great for evening out skin-tone and getting rid of blemishes. It can be a little harsh on the skin so a moisturizer should be used with it.</li>
    <li> Same as the cream best when shower the soap</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing. I have light/olive skin complexion. For as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve had really dark intimate areas and armpits. It&#x27;s made me very insecure over the years. After consistently using for 1 week It lightened my dark inner thighs after two weeks the dark areas around my anus have completely lightened to the color of my skin!! i use it morning and night and leave it on for about 5 minutes. Keep using it, it works! Don&#x27;t exfoliate while using this product as it will burn because it&#x27;s soo strong by itself. Thank you H20 I think you are one of the better quality papaya soaps out there. Don&#x27;t change your formula!!</li>
    <li> Okay, I needed a natural soap, I first used the rdl papaya soap, which I liked and it was natural, it worked gradually and i noticed the result.I was going to make a new purchase, then, I saw this popped up under related soap, I saw it had good reviews and decided to try this instead. When it came, I noticed that it says bleaching soap, probably has some hidden ingredients in it, maybe hydroquinone. It didn&#x27;t work, it broke me out and made my pregnancy mask worse..signs of hydroquinone, which im allergic to. I bought 3 of these junk and I threw them away. I&#x27;m beginning to think the good reviews were madeup..I am returning to rdl papaya. I&#x27;m sorry, but this is my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 days and it has aleady cleared up my pimples. I have not seen any change in my complextion yet but only time can tell. If your looking for something to rid your face of pimples and you have sensitive skin like myself I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had dark bleemishing on my skin due to child birth also stretch marks this soap is the best after only using it for three days I saw results now after a week I really see results I&#x27;m gonna order the soap and cream combo next...this soap is great I used it for my arm pits and my stomach it&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> I was very surprised to see that this soap has no reviews, it works really well.  I have only been using this product for 3 days when I started noticing results.  However you would need to use moisturizer because it does dry out your skin.  I use this soap all over my. The bar is pretty big and you get a lot of lather so it would last a while. My soap last for about 3 or 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product a 5 star but the vendor sent me \\&quot;Papaya Cream\\&quot; and not the soap. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Sting a lot ...didn&#x27;t really work for ME......</li>
    <li> This soap is excellent. It is a big bar, so it will not melt easily and it last longer then most soaps. This soap lighten my skin the same day I used it. I was dark brown now I am light brown. In order to see results, you must use this soap everyday and leave soap suds on skin for 2 minutes then rinse it off. Make sure you use a white towel because this soap will lighten dark color towels.</li>
    <li> Excellent for getting rid of dark spots on your face!</li>
    <li> I love this product :) it really works, I have only been using this product for 3 days and I already seeing the result. The shipping was very fast I got it before the estimated delivery time, this product over all is very amazing and I will buy again for sure. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 weeks. It works really quickly on your face. I noticed that my face was lighter in 3 days. Your body takes longer to see results, The dark marks on my arms are starting to fade a little but, my complexion isn&#x27;t really lightning up. One thing that I do is let it sit on my body for a minute. My face, a few seconds. It burns my face if let it sit too long. I will definitely be purchasing more. The only con about the product is that it runs out fast. So, I use 1 bar a week.(Edited 12/10/16 *After my last few purchases. I might try a different brand. My soap has been shipped to me open. Out of the wrapping. Deeming it ineffective.)</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, and love this soap. Unlike many other Filipino whitening soaps I&#x27;ve tried, this one actually gets rid of pimples when I use it at night and helps lighten my freckles. Since its a rather large sized soap, I cut it in chunks so that it lasts longer and use what I need. I will def purchase another soon! Very pleased with price and product results.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me. I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It takes about 2 weeks to see the progress but it works!!!</li>
    <li> cant tell if it lightened or not</li>
    <li> This soap is good and it is pretty big so you can get a great amount of use out of it! It makes your skin soft and to me it is very clarifying! Be sure to immediately apply lotion or some sort of body butter after each use to moisturize because it is very drying!!</li>
    <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
    <li> Since this product did not include any directions, I followed the advice given by others here who&#x27;ve purchased it. I have now used it for about three weeks, twice a day with no results. I applied it to both forearms, which have been darkened from a reaction to IV insertion during surgery. My skin tone is medium brown so I was hoping to lighten the areas for a more uniform appearance when wearing short sleeves. The only plus I have found it that the bar is a very large one and will probably last at least another month if not more.</li>
    <li> Bleached my armpits within weeks . Still using to bleach my inner thighs , no results yet @ 3 months.</li>
    <li> Used for about a month, but did notice a major difference body wise. I could also see the difference in my facial color after each application. Does take a while to start effectiveness for body, but does work.</li>
    <li> Although my order got lost in transit, the seller was kind enough to send a replacement ! I have only used this soap once but i could see a difference. I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of my tom tan &amp; i could see improvement already. Just hoping it goes away completely !</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling great!</li>
    <li> Soap have done nothing for my skin so far i ordered based on reviews.</li>
    <li> The soap does what it says. I have used it six times and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to a month or longer now, and I really love the refreshing feeling it leaves on my face. My skin feels really smooth and clear. My face hasn&#x27;t gotten considerably lighter as of yet, but I feel as if it is doing something to slowly cleanse my skin. I suffer from hyper-pigmentation and I&#x27;m hoping that this product helps me with that.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product I uses the soap morning and night,it made a great difference in my skin complexion..it lasts long also.. I had mine for three months now.</li>
    <li> I love it. My skin looks better than ever!!!</li>
    <li> Let me start by commending the seller. I received my goods before the estimated delivery time and they (i ordered three) were in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Now the soap works perfectly! I have been using one bar of soap since early August and it still hasn&#x27;t finished. I started off by bathing and washing my face with it but then after a while I stopped bathing with it and just used it to wash my face. I use it twice a day. Now it&#x27;s early October and I have been receiving numerous compliments on how my face has cleared up. My spots are still there but they&#x27;re fading away. Usually these soaps don&#x27;t work for me but this has. I am dark skinned and have really stubborn skin that&#x27;s why I am so ecstatic that this has been working. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this soap didn&#x27;t see results til soap was low..if use a little scrubber on area where u have brown spots it works faster ...have ordered again...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started to use it with a difference, along with Kojie San skin soap after the papaya.  I hope it&#x27;s strong to help exfoliate away my hyper-pigmentation faster. The only thing is, not much pleasant fragrance. It&#x27;s actually fragrance-free.  For sensitive skins, it might be good, but I like a nice fragrance on soaps. It feels much better in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great but you&#x27;ll need a moisturizer after using it. I used it 8 times already it did what they said so I recommend it and I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for about 2-3 weeks now. I have noticed a difference in clearing up scars. It does dry your skin though so make sure you moisturize, i use coconut oil just because I don&#x27;t want any other lotions to mess with the process. I&#x27;m excited to keep seeing results.</li>
    <li> I have been using Papaya Soap for years. I tried this one and works well for me. I&#x27;m very satisfied. Shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> This is soap is amazing! In less than 2 weeks I was I definitely lighter skinned and I was born a beautiful brown woman! But this is something to keep at all times!</li>
    <li> Do just what it say clear complexion</li>
    <li> Just ordered and received this soap for the second time, great results! If your looking for a few shades lighter this will definitely do the trick didn&#x27;t recognize the results until people started calling me light  skin and found myself in light skin girl conversations! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> very good and very good</li>
