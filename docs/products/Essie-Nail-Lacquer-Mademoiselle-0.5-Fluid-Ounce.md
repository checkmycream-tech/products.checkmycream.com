      <li>Great color</li>
      <li>It looks great on my toes.  </li>
      <li>The product came intact, wrapped very nicely in bubble-wrap and was not opened or spilled.</li>

      <li>Love Essie</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
      <li>This nail polish really must look good on all skin tones .</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, goes on smooth, dries pretty quickly, and reflects the light beautifully.</li>
      <li>This is the color is more of a skin tone, good for a french manicure.</li>
      <li>This color is a great professional nail color and very feminine!</li>
      <li>When I got the package I was so excited, but when I opened the box the nail polish looked like it had been used already and had a splotch of the nail polish on the bottle to show what color it was as if it had been a tester in a store.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something very understated this is perfect, otherwise I&#x27;d try another Essie pink called &amp;#34;Got Engaged!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I wanted to get a bottle of my own to use inbetween professional manicures.</li>
      <li>I think I need a more gentle brand  of nail polish....such as OPI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good for everyday or work wear as well as for more formal occasions.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect shade for giving a very natural look while adding a little oomph.  </li>
      <li>Pretty, but nothing special.</li>
      <li>The fast shipping is the only good thing about this.</li>
      <li>...only takes a clear top coat or two during the week</li>
      <li>Essie&#x27;s Mademoiselle is a great color for pale skin.  </li>
      <li>I will continue my search for the right color.</li>
      <li>This color is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
      <li>Bought this after seeing it won some beauty award and I was looking for a nice neutral pink.</li>
      <li>It is still pretty though.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Arrived as expected, this is the most popular color for french and natural looking nails!</li>
      <li>Although, I love the color it is not very opaque.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like color on my nails, so</li>
      <li>and it got here fast.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so much cheaper on amazon.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even return it now because Amazon says it&#x27;s considered hazardous waste.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s suppose to be a \\&quot;classic grown-up pink\\&quot; according to Essie&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>I love Mademoiselle especially, but I&#x27;ve tried that color and several others.  </li>
      <li>It just just so pretty and in general</li>
      <li>I am very surprised that it made the Allure Beauty List for 2012 because I am not a fan in any way, shape or form.</li>
      <li>Even though the bottle says it&#x27;s \\&quot;mademoiselle\\&quot; but it is clearly not the right color.</li>
      <li>It is pretty but it very sheer, like clear nail polished classed up a notch.</li>
      <li>With one or two coats it brightens my natural nails, but is still transparent and can see my whites.</li>
      <li>In the bottle it looks pink but once applied it is little more than a clear color, maybe if I applied 5 coats I would see some hint of the shade.</li>
      <li>Your nails look almost clear with a slight shade pink, very pretty and shiny looking.</li>
      <li>This could be my fault for thinking that it would actually show up as a pink, when it is really a translucent color.  </li>
      <li>Not sure its the right color.</li>
      <li>Not too pale, not too pink, just right!</li>
      <li>The color is not &amp;#34;too pink&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;too white.&amp;#34; One coat adds a sheer tint of pink which gives a very natural, manicured look.</li>
      <li>The color is displayed a little brighter in the picture than it is when you see it in real life.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This nail polish really must look good on all skin tones . . . just like In Style magazine recommended.  It looks great on my toes.  Not too pale, not too pink, just right!</li>
    <li> Overall I would rate this 4 stars. The product came intact, wrapped very nicely in bubble-wrap and was not opened or spilled. The color is displayed a little brighter in the picture than it is when you see it in real life. It takes about three coats in order to get the color to show up on your nail and not have your nail show through under the polish.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected, this is the most popular color for french and natural looking nails! Will order from again as soon as I use these 2 bottles!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a pink color. This is the color is more of a skin tone, good for a french manicure.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like color on my nails, so when I saw someone recommending this color I was hopeful it would be as they described, a sheer wash of color that could be layered. I have to say I love it! With one or two coats it brightens my natural nails, but is still transparent and can see my whites. I used it on my toes and fingers and will definitely make this my go to color.</li>
    <li> I am just waiting for my hands and fingers to be tanned...looks soooooo nice and chic!! definetely in my &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; colors of Essie</li>
    <li> This color is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Not clear, but not pink either.  It is the perfect shade for giving a very natural look while adding a little oomph.  Just a couple of coats and my nails look like I just had them done.  SO HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Not sure its the right color. Polish seams watered down.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;modemoiselle&amp;#34; color did not look good on my nails(I have fair skin). It is a transparent color and on my nails it looked like someone melted latex on them. It did however hold well for the day.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted. I used it my nail salon and it was perfect. One coat is all I use and it just enhances the natural nail slightly. I wanted to get a bottle of my own to use inbetween professional manicures. It&#x27;s perfect. Glad I bought my own.</li>
    <li> This basically gives a &amp;#34;your nails, but better&amp;#34; look - it is a sheer and ladylike pink. Good for everyday or work wear as well as for more formal occasions. Easy to apply, goes on smooth, dries pretty quickly, and reflects the light beautifully. Recommended.</li>

    <li> Essie&#x27;s Mademoiselle is a great color for pale skin.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years; it is perfect for the office.</li>
    <li> Great color and it got here fast. Takes 3 coats though.</li>
    <li> Bought this after seeing it won some beauty award and I was looking for a nice neutral pink. It is pretty but it very sheer, like clear nail polished classed up a notch. Pretty, but nothing special. No problems with chipping etc.</li>
    <li> I am pretty disappointed in this color. I was looking for a soft, pale pink shade and thought this might be it. Unfortunately, it is rather nonexistent in any color at all. In the bottle it looks pink but once applied it is little more than a clear color, maybe if I applied 5 coats I would see some hint of the shade. I will continue my search for the right color.</li>
    <li> Love Essie and it&#x27;s so much cheaper on amazon. This color is a great professional nail color and very feminine! I think my sister and I have been through 3 bottles now!</li>
    <li> The fast shipping is the only good thing about this. Even though the bottle says it&#x27;s \\&quot;mademoiselle\\&quot; but it is clearly not the right color. It&#x27;s suppose to be a \\&quot;classic grown-up pink\\&quot; according to Essie&#x27;s website. What I got is a beige color and will no way be noticeable on my nails. I bought this hoping to save a bit of money and a trip to the drug store, but don&#x27;t waste your time with this. I can&#x27;t even return it now because Amazon says it&#x27;s considered hazardous waste. So now I&#x27;m stuck with a color that I didn&#x27;t even want and is completely useless.</li>
    <li> I love this color. I choose it off of someone else&#x27;s review. It has a nice gloss, shine to it, very light color. Your nails look almost clear with a slight shade pink, very pretty and shiny looking.</li>
    <li> Love this color!  It&#x27;s neutral and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Long-lasting too.  ...only takes a clear top coat or two during the week</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame.....I love Mademoiselle especially, but I&#x27;ve tried that color and several others.  After wearing tje polish on my nails for a week or so, my nails are really dry and brittle when I remove the polish.  I think I need a more gentle brand  of nail polish....such as OPI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Miller</li>
    <li> Amazon has the best price for Essie nail polish and I have prime shipping, so it&#x27;s a no brainer.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this color.  It is extremely sheer, so I had to apply 3 coats.  Even with 3 coats, I did not like the color, or lack thereof.  This could be my fault for thinking that it would actually show up as a pink, when it is really a translucent color.  I am very surprised that it made the Allure Beauty List for 2012 because I am not a fan in any way, shape or form.</li>
    <li> Reliable long-lasting neutral nail color.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish. It just just so pretty and in general I love all essie nail colors that go on so beautiful and they last.</li>
