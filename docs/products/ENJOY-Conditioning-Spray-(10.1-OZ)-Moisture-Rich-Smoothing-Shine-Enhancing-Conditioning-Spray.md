<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not worth the money. Great brand name but the product doesn&#x27;t live up to it.</li>
    <li> been using this for years just spray it in after you shampoo and dry  really helps bleached hair and smells great</li>
    <li> This conditioning spray is perfect for my curly hair.  After washing my hair with the Enjoy shampoo and conditioner, I spray a little of this in my hair and style with the style cream and I am one happy girl with smooth, frizz free curls.</li>
    <li> I like it because it&#x27;s light but I do find it leaves a slightly greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioning spray, it makes your hair shiny but not greasy and untangles the hair so it it easy to brush.</li>
    <li> The best de-tangler I have found out there, for knotty fine hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we expected. Very happy.</li>
    <li> After a hair tragedy where a color \\&quot;expert\\&quot; burned off half of my hair, I returned to my amazing stylist (who lived 6 hours away -why I tried to change), who not only styled what was left of my once long, blonde hair, but turned me on to this Enjoy product.  3 years later, my hair is longer, healthier, and stronger than it was in the first place.  I have very fine hair, and hard water, and the conditioning spray detangles, and protects and IS NOT HEAVY or GREASY.  It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> The best product to protect your hair from the heat of dryers and hair irons.</li>
    <li> Great leave-in conditioner! I have fine hair and does not weigh my hair down. I also like to spray on my skin after the shower!</li>
    <li> This product smells great. And it works well accompanied with flat ironing.</li>
    <li> as advertised. Wife already uses the product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I started buying it from my hair salon but it&#x27;s way more expensive there so I&#x27;m super happy I found it on Amazon.  This product is fantastic.  I use it after every wash, and my hair looks and feels so healthy.  I notice a significant difference in the texture/shine of my hair if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair (but a lot of it) after I wash and dry my hair it tends to get frizzy. I use this after I shower as a detangler, and then again after it dries and it completely de-frizzes my hair giving me soft natural looking waves. It has UV protectant so if you color your hair if helps retain the color longer. You can also use it on your skin as a moisturizer, one less thing to pack if you&#x27;re traveling! I thank my hair dresser everytime I see her for suggesting I use this, I can&#x27;t go a day without it. They also sell a 10.1 oz, but it&#x27;s hit or miss finding it online here.</li>
    <li> Enjoy makes the BEST hair products. I love this leave in conditioner, I use it after every shower. It protects your hair from damage and tangling, and also sun damage. I am a dyed blonde and all their products are sulfate free. It is a little pricey but worth the money usually one bottle last me 6 months!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works great on my thick, shoulder length hair. It smells fantastic, cuts down the frizz and detangles really well.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and can&#x27;t live without it.  Makes a huge difference in styling my hair.  I spray it all over my hair after I have toweled it dry and before I comb it.  Takes all the tangles out so the comb or brush just glides through it.  Used it on my daughters hair when she was young and helped immensely to comb out the tangles.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that has recently become more wavy and dull. Low and behold I purchase Enjoy Hydrating shampoo and conditioner and keep spritzing this awesome conditioning spray periodically throughout the day...Curls are Back! they haven&#x27;t looked this healthy in 12 years! It only took 2 weeks to see a complete 180. Even my husband (who doesn&#x27;t notice his Valentines present in our living room for three days) noticed the difference and complemented me on it! I couldn&#x27;t believe the positive response in the health of my hair! I&#x27;ve purchased two more bottles since; I&#x27;m a lifer with this product!!</li>
    <li> Best product out there...best price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have bought this spray a couple of times, and may buy more in the future. It makes my really long fine hair easier to comb through and leaves it soft and shiny, without looking like a product is in it.</li>
    <li> I just love this product and was really happy to receive it at such a great price. The turn around time was great as well. I only wish that enjoy still sold their conditioning spray in large bottles. I hate having to go through so many of them...</li>
    <li> I love enjoy products, but i thought this was just okay. Received it on time though! :-D</li>
    <li> this is an awesome heat protectant, uv protectant, color protectant, you name it, it protects it. i was trying to find something that would keep my color dark weeks after i dye it, because i also have highlights that i use a purple shampoo on to keep that platinum look. but the purple shampoo often strips all the color off. THIS IS IT! three weeks later my hair is still as dark as the day i got it done because of this spray. i was also having a problem finding a heat protector that didnt leave a nasty residue on my flat iron, found it in this product. most heat protectants leave your hair feeling like straw but this leaves your hair feeling soft and silky. my other problem was finding a product that didnt weigh my hair down, and this for sure doesn&#x27;t AND i double up for when i blow dry and then a couple of sprays when my hair is dry to protect from flat iron or curling iron. and my hair most definitely weighed down and still hold curls... this product is AMAZING! it does EVERYTHING!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing it does wonders to your hair. 😃</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for five years now.</li>
    <li> Seeing as how my girlfriend now has me buying her this on Amazon when she can not make it to a Sephora, I am assuming it is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Enjoy products are wonderful.  They are best when they are used together.  This helps my hair stay healthy as I grow it out.  Recommend strongly.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t moisturize my dry, frizzy, wavy hair. It smells really good, but my hair was limp and painfully tangled after each use. Not a product for me.</li>
    <li> I love Enjoy products, but this is the best by far. I don&#x27;t know what they put in this stuff, but it works wonders. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I&#x27;m black and my hair is chemically relaxed, which makes it dry and a bit more fragile. Enjoy conditioning spray brings it back to life. I spray on a bit after I wash and condition and right before I blow dry. This spray coats your hair and protects it from heat like no other. Whenever I run out (because this stuff is very hard to find) I can tell the difference immediately. This spray also works well on hair that&#x27;s between washes. It expensive, but it lasts a couple of months. I&#x27;ve tried other leave-in conditioners, but nothing compares. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Hi guys. First I want to tell that Im not good in English so sorry if I have some mistakes.  How about this spray OMG so amazing. Its makes my hair so soft and silk.  I bought this leave in conditioner for my h as ir extension to keep them moisturesed and soft. Yes its works. You can spray it for your hair extension everyday to refresh and add good smell. Highly recommended for everyone who has clip in extensions and its really good for natural hair. Love it so muchhhh. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤</li>
    <li> Makes my fine blonde hair less frizzy and more straight if I spray it on after I shower with wet hair and love the way it smells too!!</li>
    <li> Does a super job and you only need a little.  The best.</li>
    <li> After shampooing and conditioning, my wife gets out of the shower and sprays this into her hair and then brushes/combs through, then blow it dry.  It detangles, protects color and is good for frizz control.  She has been using it for years.  I originally bought it from her hairdresser, who recommended it, but now we buy it straight from Amazon because it is less expensive than what we were paying locally.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but it is not outrageous either.  (can&#x27;t put a price on beauty my wife says . . . )</li>
    <li> AMAZING spray conditioner. The best I have ever tried, and will stick with this forever</li>
    <li> My hair is very frizzy and dry and this makes my hair more manageable. Dosen&#x27;t make it feel&lt;br /&gt;weighed down or flat. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and buying it at the salon is to costly.  It works so well to repair my dry hair from blow drying and the hot iron.  Much more reasonably priced and my husband accepts it is one of my splurges...my liquid gold!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several conditioning sprays, but this one is the best for condition without weighing your hair down.</li>
    <li> Great prices and great product!  I love the way this leaves my hair.  I blow-dry my hair everyday and it is dry from the bleach so this product allows me to keep my hair soft and fluffy :)  I have used other spray conditioners and they leave my hair feeling greasy and oily looking, this product never has done this.  I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair feeling soft and smelling delicious.  It keeps my hair from getting frizzy and dry.  I use it especially after swimming to get some moisture back into my hair.</li>
    <li> I second Nailpolish24Freak&#x27;s review.  I bought this at the urging of a friend who loves it but the Enjoy Conditioning Spray did nothing positive for my hair.  The smell is fabulous so I&#x27;m giving it two stars for that reason alone, but my hair feels and looks dry and was horribly tangled when I brushed it out. It&#x27;s back to the Moroccan Argan oil, which makes my hair feel soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I just started going to Super Cuts since my hair is very long and I only ever need a trim, so I refuse to spend the $55+ dollars at a salon to get it cut. Anyway, the girl cutting my hair used the Enjoy Shaping Lotion and tried to get me to buy it. I told her I would wait until my hair dried and I was able to spend a day with the product in my hair, until I made a decision. I realized the next day that my hair has never maintained its curl so well without getting frizzy so I went back to buy it. I accidentally bought the wrong thing and got this Enjoy Conditioning Spray. Which I am very glad I did. It keeps my curls intact the WHOLE day as well as the day after...or until I wash my hair. It&#x27;s pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I would say the difference between this Conditioning spray and the Shaping lotion would be that the lotion has more of a \\&quot;hold\\&quot; to it, kind of like I could feel the product keeping my hair together. Which I was still was okay with because it worked great.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fought with my curly hair for a very long time and I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t dry it out with alcohol, something that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy, and I didn&#x27;t want to have to flat iron it all the time. I am at peace with my curly hair now. THANK GOD. I am extremely happy with this product and I want to go back and buy the Shaping Lotion sometime soon. The way I use the product is: I wash my hair (shampoo and conditioner) and then I comb my hair and spray this conditioning spray all over. I then re-comb. I put my hair how however I feel comfortable letting it dry and then I do not try to touch it. It&#x27;s a fool proof spray I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it everyday. Conditions without making my hair greasy or oily and this is a small miracle since I naturally have that you of hair</li>
    <li> My hair has never been softer or healthier in my entire life. I get compliments on my hair daily. I&#x27;ve been using Enjoy hair products for about 2 years now, always the Luxury line, and I&#x27;ll never use anything different. I would buy it from a hairdresser dresser though, can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s a genuine product unless you buy it from a hairdresser listed on Enjoy.com.</li>
    <li> Enjoy is a little expensive, but if you love your hair, you will spend the money. This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> it was leaking within the box so I returned it. Other than that, I really do love the product. I just need to get it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Great conditioning spray.  Ordered with Enjoy Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. Ordering another bottle of conditioning spray now.  Highly recommended.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> The whole Enjoy line of product I use/have keeps me saying I do!!!  Yes I do enjoy my hair after I&#x27;ve used these quality products at a very reasonable price.  I use the conditioning spray in conjunction to the leave-n-conditioner to wrap my hair. But is the creamy texture of the leave in that lays the hair while the conditioning spray detangles it prior to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m an African American women who has done home maintenance for well over 20 years.  I have used most of the black hair care lines...what Sally&#x27;s had to offer coupled with enough beauty warehouse/supply (Do Grow; Motions; Olive Oil; Dr Miracles too many to list)...but I tell you know lie...ENJOY is the BEST I&#x27;VE EVER USED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to note that I work out 4-5 times a week, and rinse my hair every time I get back from my work out.  I rinse out the salt, then do a treatment (Enjoy IRS &amp; IRS cream or Mask), and then (Just Enjoy conditioner of my choice &amp;#34;Luxury is soooo good). Then after that one two combo I was with my favorite Enjoy duo (Yellow Moisture Enjoy shampoo/conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair grows like a weed, and my hair designer husband is just shocked at how healthy my hair is despite all the water exposure.  Yes I swim too...get it all wet up, and Enjoy clarifying spray is the business.  Did that right after a fresh perm, and hair was on point...(clarifying spray combo w/sulfate free green Enjoy shampoo...only one w/o conditioner set, and then I did the IRS treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I plan to enjoy my hair for as long as it grows via this Brand and this brand only!!!</li>
    <li> I have very fine very long straight hair but I have quite a bit of it as well so I need a good leave in that won&#x27;t weight it down.  I have been using this for about 2 years now and no matter how much you spray on your hair it just leaves it soft and manageable without feeling greasy afterwards.  After drying my hair it does not feel like I have a product left in it and that is very important to me.  I have also now turned my girlfriend who also has very long hair (very thick and straight) onto this product as well and she is also very pleased with the results!!!</li>
    <li> My Wife uses it on her hair daily. She can use it on wet or dry hair to help make her hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this leave in conditioner. I have bleached, colored, fine, long hair and used to HATE brushing my hair especially when it was wet. After I discovered this leave in conditioner my life has changed. I no longer spend minutes....hours....trying to untangle my hair but am able to spritz my head a couple times with this and brush through instantly. I recommend trying this. It is worth every penny. Spend the extra money on this and stop wasting money on cheap grocery store knock offs that don&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
    <li> I love this spray.  I use it as a detangler after I get out of the shower.  I have long normal hair.  It works beautifully as a detangler and mild conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great smell and nice to spray in your hair after for conditioning and manageability.  Enjoy products are really good for asian hair and coarse dry hair.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my hair...but you can also use it on your skin to moisturize. It smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this conditioning spray many times. It also doubles as a great lightweight lotion and smells great. Very useful for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and even though I try an alternative brand sometimes, usually recommended by my hairdresser, it always falls short of Enjoy results. For some reason it&#x27;s very hard to find in retail outlets or hair salons. Their distribution is poor and it took me a few years before I thought of Amazon. Glad to have it back in my life.</li>
    <li> Due to the drought in Cali, I thought I could cut down my shower times by using a leave-in. I love Enjoy products and was not disappointed! Works great! When product arrived, the bottle was way different then the picture. The bottle was purple. So I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a new packaging or really old packaging but the product is authentic. I have bought it in the past from a salon and it smells and works just as well.</li>
    <li> Love. Always get things quick from this company</li>
    <li> Scent is a little too strong. I bought this sight unseen on the recommendation of my hair stylist who uses it on her young daughter. My 5 yo and my husband and I all think the scent is too strong, but it works for detangling, for the most part. Not any better than other products I have used.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the way this product made my hair feel (coated); this is likely more a function of my hair than the product.</li>
    <li> it has great smell and effect on your hair. plus you can either wash or leave on. definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love how this make my hair feel. Its the Exact same thing the salon sells for more money. It&#x27;s a great buy.  I ordered this product on May 3 2015 and it was $14 a bottle. Today, August 13, I wanted to place another order, I buy 2 at a time because we have 4 girls in the house that use this product and love it. But I&#x27;m not loving the price anymore. They have upped the price to $27 for one bottle. That is outrages. I wanted to email them to ask if there was a price error, but the link to contact them does not work. How could they double the price in just 3 months time? If I had known they were going to do that I would have stocked up, as I have ordered it for about 3 years through them. I won&#x27;t be buying it anymore. My teen girls are going to be so disappointed. Let me know if anyone knows of a affordable replacement.</li>
    <li> GREAT product for a &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; conditioner.  Makes styling your hair easier.  For all hair types. Highly recommend.  Once again Amazon gave &amp;#34;5 star&#x27; customer service !!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for my thick curly hair. Most recently I switched from argan oil to this and it has made the biggest difference!!!!! My hair is so soft and smooth with hardly any frizz after blow drying, when it used to be a huge frizzy mess. Straightening my hair is super fast and it looks flawless afterwards. I won&#x27;t ever be without this product again!</li>
    <li> I like the conditioning and defanging properties.  Way better than tons of products I bought before.  As for 4 and not 5 stars- I like 7seconds better because it has a nicer smell. This works just as wel though and size for the money is a steal!</li>
    <li> I love the enjoy leave in products. They work great on my dry hair. This is one of my favorites</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I like the smell and it gets my brush threw the worst tangles! I&#x27;m glad I found it for such a good buy!</li>
    <li> I have really long hair and 4 kids. It works so great that I bo one for each of my kids. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> This product is a great light leave in conditioner with a very pleasant fragrance which does not weigh hair down.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with this company.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on me the last time I got my hair done, and I decided to get some of my own. I love this stuff! It does a great job at detangling and making my hair smooth, plus, it smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I found the price is pretty much the same all over, but used Prime so saved on shipping costs.</li>
    <li> very good for your hair.</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it often</li>
    <li> This product does it all - It conditions, detangles, protects from the sun and heat from hair tools, and it smells WONDERFUL!! I use it every time I wash my hair and have not had a single issue with it.  I will continue to buy this product over and over!</li>
    <li> Best price I have paid for this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...it works great, leaves my hair feeling soft and it smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> The spray is a good product but the shipping has to be improved. It had leaked put all over the bubble wrap and so a quarter of the conditioner was gone when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great for after the pool or ocean......</li>
    <li> My hair stylist told me about the ENJOY shampoo and condition (the pink star bottles), and I purchased those. I LOVE THEM! They are so amazing! I saw this, and saw that it got great reviews for fine hair that tangles easily. This product is a great detangler/moisturizer/protectant. I washed my hair with my new ENJOY shampoo and conditioner, it felt great! When I got out of the shower I sprayed this all over my hair, no tangles!!! The comb went through like silky butter!! It also felt so healthy and hydrated!!&lt;br /&gt;I have hair exentsions, plus really fine hair that tangles in minutes no matter what I do. These products are amazing for this type of hair, and extensions! No matter what I did my hair always felt dry, and I don&#x27;t use a lot of heat on my hair, I rarely color it, I use all types of hair masks, etc. Nothing made my hair feel like it has with ONE use of these ENJOY products! I feel like these products will prolong the life of my hair extensions by a long shot, as well as keeping my hair ultra healthy!! A little goes a LONG way as well, so the bottles should last several months! I am also excited because there were a lot of great reviews on this spray for protecting your hair when you are in the pool or the ocean! With hair extensions, and fine dry hair....... this is a MUST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are a great price on Amazon, in the salons each one is about $28 per bottle!! I saved about $50 getting them off Amazon then buying in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total save, great deal, worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this stuff a few months. I bought because I blow-dry everyday usually with high heat and don&#x27;t want to damage my hair. This stuff works great. I have curly hair and this stuff helps with frizz, keeps my hair soft, shiny and bouncy. I use with just a little bit of curling mousse, blow dry and I&#x27;m out the door. I will continue ordering this spray as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> I am a &amp;#34;hair person&amp;#34; (no I am not by trade), but I love taking good care of my hair. This product not only helps me keep my hair smooth, shiny and well conditioned, but it also makes my long and thick hair easier to comb through than any product I&#x27;ve tried, and I have tried A LOT of products, including detangle spray for kids and making my own as well as other products. I LOVE IT AND WILL NEVER GET ANYTHING ELSE BUT THIS!!! :)</li>
    <li> Great price. Use this conditioner along time. Has protectant for your hair from exposure. Like it a lot</li>
    <li> Love this. Light enough to use on fine, thin hair. Just layer with a volumizer. I use Sebastian Volupt Volume Building Spray Gel Unisex.</li>
    <li> This item showed up a day early and was packaged very well. no complaints here. I will order again :)</li>
    <li> ...and it&#x27;s a great product. This product gets sprayed on my ends after every shower and before bed and my hair stays shiny and soft as well as tangle free.</li>
    <li> No shine, not for me. Left my hair dryer &amp; frizzier! John Freida drugstore spray is much better at a third of price. This is for someone who spares no expense when something really works. Not for me!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend and I will definitely purchase again! Makes hair tangle free and blow drying a breeze!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has waist-length hair.  This product helps us get the tangles out after shampooing.  And we use it when her hair is dry when the wind has caused static electricity.</li>
    <li> I would probably die without this product. I have extensions, and my hair can get SUPER knotted up. This stuff gets the tangles right out without damaging my hair. It&#x27;s great to spray on your hair before a shower, too. LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> I use this on my wet hair after my shower.  Really helps to detangle it. Won&#x27;t make it greasy so don&#x27;t be afraid to use as much as you want/need.  Then I spray on my styling product.  So happy I found this!</li>
    <li> winter and swimming have been making my hair tangle and feel like straw.  A few pumps of this stuff smoothest out the tangles and my hair is soft again.  It feels a little heavier than it used to be,  but I don&#x27;t use it everyday. Smells good.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product when an enjoy representative brought it in for my aunt&#x27;s salon to try. I immediately went home and ordered it. My hair is obnoxiously impossible to brush out especially when wet. No product has worked for my disastrous head of hair before. This conditioning spray is a God&#x27;s send! I spray it in when wet and let it sit while I do my makeup. My hair then brushes out like a dream! It&#x27;s also awesome for after swimming and it makes my hair super soft and shiny!  Not to mention it smells WONDERFUL! Thanks enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It leaves the hair shiny and feeling strong. I have really tangled hair and this did the trick. My tangles comb out like they were never even there. There is a smell to it, I find it pleasant. I can&#x27;t really explain it though. Definitely recommend this product. I will certainly be buying it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and is a light weight leave in spray conditioner, makes my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years.  I use it every time I wash my hair as a lightweight leave in conditioner (though the bottle states that you can rinse it out, if you like).  Because I have fine straight color treated hair it took me a long time to find a leave-in conditioner that moisturized my hair without weighing it down or making it look &#x27;greasy&#x27;.  I like this product so much that I always keep a back-up bottle to use when traveling.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This came in the mail fast. It was sealed! So I know they didnt water it down. Good stuff. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, I love it! Just a few spritzes after washing my hair and its soft and tangles are gone. The product was shrink wrapped so it shipped well-no leaks. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me to ward off mosquitos in the summer. It didn&#x27;t do the trick. It&#x27;s a mediocre hair product that leaves my hair flat. I don&#x27;t like the smell. It&#x27;s just...blah.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have nearly waist length; thick hair that is almost impossible to comb through after a shower. So  I spritz this all over my hair and by some miracle, it is so much easier to brush through! It smells nice, feels nice and conditioning, and lasts me probably four weeks of everyday use.</li>
    <li> Love it and use it every day. My hair is really dry and tangles easily. This stuff works very well. Shampoo and Conditioner are great as well.</li>
    <li> This product is actually a spray cream, and as such was way too heavy for my fine hair. Once I diluted it with quite a bit of water, it was ok, but still weighed it down. This product is probably great for people with course, thick hair but I will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products..awesome for controlling the frizz</li>
    <li> Best hair care product I&#x27;ve come across. This brand is awesome. The item showed up correct and undamaged the first time.</li>
    <li> I love enjoy products, Ph balance is perfect, it&#x27;s really expensive if you by any hair salon Amazon has the best deals</li>
    <li> I love this spray! This conditioner has a really nice scent, not heavy or perfumey at all (not to me).  My hair is definitely on the drier side, so I like having a conditioning spray to use since I wash my hair every other day.  I wear a uniform to work, so once I put my hair into a ponytail or braid, I&#x27;ll spritz this on before I walk out the door.  My hair still smells good at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Best conditioning spray ever, light weight, smells good. I use it every day. Enjoy products never let me down</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff. Helps to detangle my hair after each shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this when I brush out my daughters&#x27; hair since my oldest was little.  Spray with water then this spray, it is an amazing for getting out tangles.  It&#x27;s good for your skin too if you get some on it, so no worries about having something sticky on your hands.  This is our go to hair product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Spray on to de-tangle hair. Goes great with the Enjoy Luxury shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel much softer</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good leave in conditioner, I highly recommend it. There are so many out there, but I will stick to this one, till I find anything even better.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing!  It detangles my girls hair like no other product I have been able to find.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever! Will be buying again. Great price also</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Smells sooooo good! Instantly detangles and protects against heat damage. I haven&#x27;t found a spray that I like more. I have long thick damage prone hair and this is the best for it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while, and like it, but I think the bottle types were different.  The sprayer came off when I opened the bottle, (stuck in cap) so now the only way I can use it is to pour the stuff on my hands and try to spread it in my hair.  This is not the way I want to use the product.  If I bought it at the salon (which costs more) as I used to do, I could have taken it back.  No, it would not be worth the trouble to package this and send it back.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with all the great reviews on this product- I bought it. I am Italian and have really frizzy hair that curls if its humid and looks like a combed out afro if its dry weather. For some strange reason, this product does not work with my hair. I gave it a few tries - used the product about 4 times and every time, after my hair is dry - my hair is stiff, stringy, matted, and tangled. Today was the first time I&#x27;ve seen my boyfriend since using this. When he saw me which was only a few hours after I did my daily straightening, he asked what I did to my hair. He said it looked terrible - dry and stringy. That&#x27;s when I realized I wasn&#x27;t the only person noticing the change in my hair since using this. Oh well - I have to go back to just putting regular Jojoba oil in my hair after I wash it instead of getting to use this amazingly scented stuff. Just wanted to post this in case there are any other Italian wiry frizzy haired people who this product does not work for.</li>
    <li> I work a desk job.  Nothing fancy, no sudden movements, not a lot of sweat or tears.  But I would still come home in the evening and find horrendously, almost irretrievably tangled dreadlocks on the underside of my hair, particularly at my collar.  I experienced pain and near-panic in my attempts to gently comb out the tangles, but I knew I would have to either get a pixie cut or find a new detangling hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several of my friends recommended Enjoy&#x27;s Conditioning Spray, and I was happy to find it for a lower price on Amazon than my friends had quoted me.  I now spray this product all over my hair in the morning while it&#x27;s still wet from the shower.  I apply it liberally to the problem area near my collar, then distribute it through with a hairbrush.  I let my hair air-dry, by personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only are my tangles significantly diminished, but my hair usually looks smoother and shinier (it&#x27;s wavy).  I still get some tangles underneath my hair in the back, but they are much easier to quickly untangle with a hairbrush.  If I don&#x27;t brush my hair before bed, the tangles come out very easily in the shower the next morning.  Enjoy Conditioning Spray is a keeper and I&#x27;ll be recommending it to all my friends who suffer from the same hair annoyances.</li>
    <li> Anything Enjoy is da bomb.  I really like this spray.  It can be used on wet or dry hair.  Provides some moisture and shine without weight.  I like it in the middle of the day when my hair feels dry (I live in Nevada).  Just spray some on and give your hair a moisture boost</li>
    <li> My hair was getting really dry and brittle. I wanted something to make it look and feel healthy and shiny...&lt;br /&gt;this was it. I love it. It made my hair smooth and shiny, silky feeling and conditioned at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or anything. I also love the fragrant of it!</li>
    <li> Good product for when you get out of the shower to detangle your hair. Helps when you have really curly hair to get all the tangles out...</li>
    <li> Great price and I like the product</li>
    <li> I do not like this product. It does nothing beneficial for my hair, not even make it smell nice.</li>
    <li> This conditioning spray really smooths out my hair. I love the conditioner too, but this spray is fantastic when I blow dry my hair. I&#x27;ve used it everyday after I wash and condition my hair and before I blow dry and flat iron my hair. My hair has been looking frizz free and great too!</li>
    <li> It is a terrific de-tangler hands down.  However, I felt it left my very fine hair (I am the real deal - a redhead - and while I have lots of hair, it is all crazy FINE) and it made my hair too soft.  My niece, who inherits all the hair products I decide don&#x27;t work for me, is totally mad about it.  ENJOY leaves her hair beautifully conditioned (she is blessed with her mother&#x27;s thick gorgeous hair that reacts a little badly to severe humidity) with a vibrant shine.  She indicated that ENJOY helped tame her tresses during humid days. I strongly recommend this product for hair that is not too fine and to use the product sparingly, maybe even spraying into your hand and working it through, at least initially, until you get a feel for how much to use.</li>
    <li> This spray is awesome! I use it when i think my hair needs a little more moisture in the morning, or when i get home from a long day at work, and my hair looks unsightly. (i.e. snarly or just dead looking)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to spray it directly on my hair unless it feels extremely dry, so usually i&#x27;ll just spray it on my hairbrush, and brush it through. That does the trick and i just love feeling my hair afterwords &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very pleasant and not overpowering at all. It lasts very long, and most people enjoy smelling it in your hair when you go to hug them. (Though, i really wouldn&#x27;t use it as a perfume or anything)&lt;br /&gt;5 stars to this, and every other ENJOY product i&#x27;ve ever used. 5 stars PLUS for the pink shampoo and conditioner. Those are AMAZING.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s really great on my hair and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy AT ALL. Especially great between haircuts to hide split ends!</li>
    <li> Was recommended by a hair dresser friend.  She got me a sample and I loved it.  I know use this in place of conditioner, no more static hair or oily hair from thick conditioners.</li>
    <li> Received as promised. Exactly what I was expecting as I have used this product for years.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful.  Smells lovely but not too strong.  Nice light conditioning spray.  I use it as a mist when I am curling my hair it seals in the moisture and makes my hair nice all day</li>
    <li> With a sensitive scalp and curly hair this is the best detangler! I use this product both on my wavy curly hair and my son&#x27;s tight curl hair. It just takes a few sprays and you can comb through the tangles without any hassle. Be careful not to spray too much though because then your hair will feel saturated with conditioner. It does not make hair sticky or greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> love this conditioning spray - my son uses it also for his face after he shaves to sooth razor burn.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product! My hair responds favorably.&lt;br /&gt;Happy!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING, I love this. My hair gets so frizzy and tangly and staticky and blah especially during winter and especially now that it&#x27;s colored and I can&#x27;t wash it as much. One application and my hair is perfectly smooth, tangle-free and good to go.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best detangler leave-in conditioner products I&#x27;ve never tried.  I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that detangles beautifully. Light, pleasant fragrance. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> this is the best hair product ever especially for color treated hair also protects hair from heat styling and it smells amazing</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product yet as it just arrived today, however I was surprised  and disappointed to find that there is no cap on the bottle. There was tape around the spray nozzle which makes it impossible to use for travel.</li>
    <li> Excellent for controlling frizz on naturally curly hair.  I put a light coating of this spray on the bottom 2/3rds of my hair, right after towel drying and using my fingers to style my curls.  I don&#x27;t rub it in.  Works great at minimizing frizz and maintaining curl shape.  Leaves my hair really soft.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years and can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> this is the only product that keeps the tears away when I am combing my daughter&#x27;s long, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had been around when my mom was combing my long, curly hair!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  thank you</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s product in it (like when you use gel or hair spray) and keeps my hair in beautiful locks.</li>
    <li> My daughters love this product.  My girls both get lots of tangles in their hair and this stuff works like a charm and with no tears.</li>
    <li> Although I really like this product I waiver on how effective it is. The trick to making most effective is to be sure your hair is ONLY damp and not right our of the tub. I guess it is kinda obvious, but if your hair is soaked it just drips right out!</li>
    <li> This works great for processed hair. It is all I use on mine and my hair is as healthy as it has ever been. Love Enjoy products!</li>
    <li> Great product for smoothing wild hair without leaving it greasy or full of product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Calms my frizzies!</li>
    <li> makes my hair smell amazing and does a great job at detangling. also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it flat.</li>
    <li> Used it for years love it</li>
    <li> The smell so really strong and chemically. It doesn&#x27;t do much for my damaged and colored hair. It works as a detangler.</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine hair. I have a hard time finding a conditioner that smooths and moisturizers without weighing down my hair. I think this product does a good job of both. On really cold, dry days it&#x27;s still a little staticky, but I think in those conditions it would be hard to avoid that. Overall, I like and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I pretty much love this product. I stopped using conventional conditioner because it made my hair greasy. This stuff makes my hair smooth and smells nice. I can see where ppl don&#x27;t like the way the liquid drips off when you spray it on wet hair...but you&#x27;re supposed to spray it on towel dry hair...so do that and you won&#x27;t have problems. It&#x27;s a nice detangler too. And nice to have when your using hotel shampoo conditioner. Ain&#x27;t nothing conditioning about that cheap shampoo. Buy a bottle you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I love this spray. It&#x27;s the only way that I can easily brush my hair after a shower without any pain. I was so excited to be able to buy this on Amazon and it was a great price compared to what I was paying.</li>
    <li> Love this spray conditioner. Smells great and feels soft after drying hair.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed receiving my conditioning spray.  It really keep s my hair from tangles and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a little more than 2 months now, and I have not noticed a difference in my hair.  I spray it after I wash my hair and it is damp.  This product does not get rid of my tangles.  In fact, I think it makes it worse...is that possible?  I think I am going to stick with my infusion, I know that stuff works and it is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this conditioning spray. My hair has a fine texture, so I prefer conditioning sprays for daily use over regular conditioner. This is a high quality conditioning spray that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or give it a greasy feel like some can. A little  goes a long way so one bottle lasts a few months even with daily usage. It has a light, fresh, fragrance. This is a product worth trying for sure.</li>
    <li> Love this makes my hair smell good and makes it soft and untangled!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is silky and bouncy. I&#x27;m an African American with very thick and coarse hair. This by far one of my must have beauty products.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair specialist in California used this product on my hair. When I moved to South Carolina I could not find it and then I thought &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;. Low and behold, Pro Concepts through Amazon had the item.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair was like straw from the heat and chlorine pool in the summer.  This conditioning spray was amazing in restoring her hair to a shiny, healthy condition.  We tried other conditioners first that didn&#x27;t compare to this one.  Enjoy Conditioning Spray was recommended by a hair salon, but found we found it at a much better price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This by far has been my favorite leave in conditioner. Even my husband loves the smell and it does help with frizz</li>
    <li> Every time I go to my hair dresser she sprays some mystery product on my hair before straightening and wa-lah! it was amazing, and soft and smelled fantastic. What is this mystery product? I ask her one day. She tells me it is this Enjoy Conditioning Spray, and then demonstrates to me how effective it is by spraying some on one of my forearms. She puts my forearms side by side and turns the blow dryer on them. What black magic is this? One arm is hot, one is not. And she says, that&#x27;s how it works on your hair. It&#x27;s expensive but I use it faithfully every time I blow dry or straighten and there is a noticeable difference in the amount of damage I inflict on my colored locks since I have started using this every time I style. Besides that, my hair is incredibly soft, shiny, and smells like heaven. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it is one of the best &amp;#34;detanglers&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the shipping was very fast!</li>
    <li> Works great.  I like the spray concept as you have more control of the amount you use.</li>
    <li> Buy this!!! It is amazing! I had learned about this product from my hairdresser. My hair was damaged and I asked her if she could do a deep treatment to repair, she recommended this product and told me I would see results in days. And I did. I am extremely rough on my naturally (very) curly hair. I straighten every day with a hair dryer and a flattening iron. I change my hair color quite a bit, but you cannot tell. My hair is so soft and shiny. I get compliments all the time. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is at a really great price. I will be buying this proudct again!! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have to come to love the Enjoy products... a  couple of sprays really work... my hair is soft and manageable</li>
    <li> Love Enjoy, but not the price. Buying on Amazon was cheaper and I received it within days of placing my order.  This spray conditioner is great for travel or just to give your hair extra softness and body in between washings</li>
