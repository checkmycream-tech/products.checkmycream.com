      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I have not tried the SPF 6 variety, which has received great reviews here on Amazon, but this seems to be just as good if not better; I was able to notice a difference in my lips in just two days.</li>

      <li>This was mighty close.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the only one among my friends who thinks that, but we all agree it is a fall/wintery flavor and that it is amazing!</li>
      <li>This stuff goes on clean and doesn&#x27;t leave your lips feeling slimy.</li>
      <li>Seriously, this is the best chapstick out there!</li>

      <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and not too powerful, has a slight minty-ness.</li>
      <li>thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>I actually just put some on right now.</li>
      <li>Not only was the spot gone, but my lips felt smooth and actually cared for!</li>

<li> You get a nice, thin layer that doesn&#x27;t feel messy and works like a charm.</li>

<li> Long lasting and works as advertised</li>
<li> Living in Southern California where the weather is always dry</li>
<li> Sometimes if I don&#x27;t drink enough water, my lips get dry and crack.</li>
<li> It also has no real smell or flavor, as a guy that&#x27;s a big plus</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got extremely chapped and cracked lips, and sometimes they even bleed from the split I have in the middle of my lips - trust me when I say this stuff WORKS.</li>
<li> This works to repair dry lips overnight.</li>
<li> Helpfull on dry days...</li>
<li> Really helps with chapped lips and eats away all the dried up, dead skin cells off of your lips.</li>
<li> It was on the corner of my upper lip for about a month and a half</li>
<li> As others noted, this was not a six pack, but a single stick of lip balm!</li>
<li> I ordered from Amazon.com as the seller, not some other company.</li>
<li> shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I was unimpressed with other brands I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
<li> I plan on trying the others once I run out of my current tube, which should take a while because their tubes aren&#x27;t small.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t vouch for other sellers, but if you get the one sold by Amazon (which is eligible for Amazon Prime), then you&#x27;ll get all six!</li>
<li> to say, the patch came back, though I&#x27;m seriously thinking it has something to do with the reusable water bottles that I used at work.</li>
<li> It makes me feel a little classier when I put my chapstick on, XP</li>
<li> I wear it everyday.</li>
<li> No more cracked lips, or itchy, abrasive, weird dry spot!</li>
<li> I bought this chapstick because I had this weird dry spot on my lip that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
<li> Ordered a 6-pack since it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
<li> For less than $3/tube you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
<li> Some make the situation even worse from my experience.</li>

    <li> I love this lip balm, but this particular product did not come as advertised. As others noted, this was not a six pack, but a single stick of lip balm! Buy Nivea, just not this configuration.</li>
    <li> 6 single lip balm in a plastic pag,very good! I can open one and storage others.</li>
    <li> Long lasting and works as advertised</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the guy that always has chapped lips. Living in Southern California where the weather is always dry I don&#x27;t go anywhere without lip balm. However, anyone like me knows that not all lip balms are equal. Some make the situation even worse from my experience. This stuff goes on clean and doesn&#x27;t leave your lips feeling slimy. You get a nice, thin layer that doesn&#x27;t feel messy and works like a charm. Wish this was sold in stores but thanks to Amazon I just buy the 6 pack. For less than $3/tube you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I was buying this at my local store, but they stopped carrying it for some reason.  I am currently on acne medication that really dries out your skin and lips.  This is the only type of lip balm that works.  It lasts a long period when applied, unlike others you have to constantly re-apply.  It also has no real smell or flavor, as a guy that&#x27;s a big plus when most of the good stuff in this segment is marketed towards women.  I will use this stuff for life at this point, haven&#x27;t ever used better.</li>
    <li> Speedy shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I was unimpressed with other brands I&#x27;ve purchased. The scent is nice and not too powerful, has a slight minty-ness. Rolls on even. Great because it has SPF in it. Great for everyday use. Will purchase again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm around.  I have tried them all at sometime or another.  Nothing compares to Nivea products.  I use it during the summer while I am on the water fishing and during the winter when skiing the slopes in Colorado.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find in stores anymore and it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me.</li>
    <li> I actually just put some on right now. I wear it everyday. It makes my lips feel so soft and hydrated. I absolutely love it. And it was pretty cheap too. I recommend anyone who has doubts to just get it. There&#x27;s no harm in trying it.</li>
    <li> While the Nivea Lip Care 15 A Kiss of Recovery is an effective product, the listing states:  . . &amp;#34;6 count&amp;#34;, which I interpreted as meaning I would receive six, not just one.  I don&#x27;t buy a lot of lip balms/sticks, so it seemed a wee bit pricey for only one.</li>
    <li> Picked this up at my Winn Dixie today - it is identical to the product listed here. I have not tried the SPF 6 variety, which has received great reviews here on Amazon, but this seems to be just as good if not better; I was able to notice a difference in my lips in just two days. I&#x27;ve got extremely chapped and cracked lips, and sometimes they even bleed from the split I have in the middle of my lips - trust me when I say this stuff WORKS.</li>
    <li> I like the product. but the title is tricky. only 1 sent to me not 6. Amazon rep did great job refunded me though</li>
    <li> This works to repair dry lips overnight. Sometimes if I don&#x27;t drink enough water, my lips get dry and crack. When this happens I use this at bedtime and in the morning my lips look great.</li>
    <li> Second favorite lip balm in the Nivea line. Great to use during the winter. Really helps with chapped lips and eats away all the dried up, dead skin cells off of your lips. This does tingle a bit when you apply it. Smells herbally. Also contains SPF 15 which is also a great BONUS because your lips also need some sun protection, too.</li>
    <li> The BEST lip stuff out there!  Ordered a 6-pack since it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Helpfull on dry days...</li>
    <li> Only 1, not 6 and it&#x27;s expired!</li>
    <li> I bought this chapstick because I had this weird dry spot on my lip that wouldn&#x27;t go away. It was on the corner of my upper lip for about a month and a half and I was about to schedule a doctor&#x27;s appointment. I had tried Carmex, wiping my lip with an alcohol wipe, Medicated Blistex, Hydrocrotizone cream -- just about everything but the kitchen sink, basically. Well, after about a week of using Nivea&#x27;s Kiss of Recovery, my lips truly recovered! Not only was the spot gone, but my lips felt smooth and actually cared for! No more cracked lips, or itchy, abrasive, weird dry spot! I was cured!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad to say, the patch came back, though I&#x27;m seriously thinking it has something to do with the reusable water bottles that I used at work. Now that I know that Nivea will make the spot go away, I&#x27;m not too worried about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM BUYING NIVEA LIP CARE PRODUCTS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!! Seriously, this is the best chapstick out there! I plan on trying the others once I run out of my current tube, which should take a while because their tubes aren&#x27;t small. I also like the fact that the tube is similar to a lipstick tube. It makes me feel a little classier when I put my chapstick on, XP</li>
    <li> Only one arrived, definitely not 6 count. Great lip balm, but listing is incorrect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a mission to find the ultimate lip balm.  This was mighty close.  The smell was nice, it felt good to go on and I didn&#x27;t have to reapply it 5 minutes later.</li>
    <li> Came as described! I ordered from Amazon.com as the seller, not some other company. I read the reviews that people have only been getting one, but I ordered anyways. I was happy to see that I did in fact get all six that I was hoping for! I can&#x27;t vouch for other sellers, but if you get the one sold by Amazon (which is eligible for Amazon Prime), then you&#x27;ll get all six! Also, it wasn&#x27;t expired like one reviewer said!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is amazing and has a scent/flavor that I can only describe as pumpkin spice. I&#x27;m the only one among my friends who thinks that, but we all agree it is a fall/wintery flavor and that it is amazing! I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I will purchase many times over.  Even my boyfriend will use it to prevent chapped lips.</li>
