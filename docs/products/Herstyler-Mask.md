      <li>Haha.</li>

      <li>and my ends are very damaged from hair color.</li>
      <li>The product worked really well for my hair.</li>
      <li>I like how it doesn&#x27;t way my hair down at all, it just leaves a nice, soft texture to my hair.</li>
      <li>However, my hair is so bouncy, I have about an inch or more, less to work with on the length.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to you.</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair so soft!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very shiny and soft....</li>

      <li>Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
      <li>It does make my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t care if its the same or not.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
      <li>It smells exactly the same and got the same results as the sample.</li>
      <li>Im not sure if this item is the original.</li>
      <li>First time I got one for like 13 $ this time I saw it for less</li>
      <li>I loved the stuff, but unfortunately ended up forgetting it when I went off to college!</li>
      <li>Especially If i rinse my hair with conditioner after shampoo and then apply the hair mask for 5-8 minutes, makes such a difference in making my hair shiny and soft.</li>

<li> after few hours.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re all I use anymore, even expensive salon brands don&#x27;t seem to give me the same results.</li>
<li> I recommend leaving it on for at least 5 minutes after shampooing your hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> My hair is highlighted and I straighten it with an iron  at least three times a week...</li>
<li> so maybe they corrected the problem after seeing all the negative commenters.</li>
<li> The photo and description are deceptive - shows the black container that is NOT the Argan Oil version, but what was shipped was indeed the&amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; brown Argan Oil container, smells terrible, not the fragrant stuff that you buy in the mall.  </li>
<li> I leave it on for about 5 minutes and rinse with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Extremely disappointed in this product!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Personally, I did not like this product as well as many other conditioners. I would give that a ONE. However, since I had it, I thought that I would  apply and lather (it does ), rinse, and repeat. It worked great. Even removed the hair spray! However, my hair is so bouncy, I have about an inch or more, less to work with on the length. In other words, it feels shorter. Just need to let it grow out a bit. It&#x27;s very shiny and soft....and my ends are very damaged from hair color.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product at a great price, I bought ten to give out as gifts for birthdays, It&#x27;s THAT kind of product, believe me all your friends will want your hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Herstyler shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask after I used my sister&#x27;s Herstyler shampoo and hair mask which she paid FULL PRICE.  I am an African American female with THICK and long natural hair and the Herstyler products leave my hair soft, shiny, and moisturized!  I am really impressed by the products and the smell is magnificent!!!  I have gotten sooooooo many compliments on the look, smell, and healthiness of my hair.  I am now a true fan!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best mask for my hair that I have been abkle to find. It made a huge difference with my hair. Especially in flyawyas and feel. I have continued to use it.</li>
    <li> I have always used the best products on my hair!  I have to say that this conditioner is in a league of its own...simply said \\&quot;awesome\\&quot;!  My hair is highlighted and I straighten it with an iron  at least three times a week...this conditioner has saved me.  My hair is silky soft, shiny and so healthy.  I have never received more complements on my hair.  I leave it in over night and rinse in the morning...just easier for me.  Plus..buying on Amazon is it such a remarkable deal.</li>
    <li> Im not sure if this item is the original. I bought one at a salon  and the  actual product  was different.</li>
    <li> It a package of 4 tubes of the hair mask not the big bowl but it is still the same product. I was just hoping for the bowl instead of 4 tubes.</li>
    <li> I received a free tub of this stuff in the mall when I bought my Jose Eber straightener. I loved the stuff, but unfortunately ended up forgetting it when I went off to college! I have two little sisters who used gobs of it every day like it was regular conditioner, not a mask. They might have had gorgeous hair for a couple weeks but that&#x27;s it. It was gone by the time I went back home :(&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo I found a tub on amazon! It is amazingly cheap!!! I was pleasantly surprised because I&#x27;m kind of strapped for money. Well my little sisters were just talking about that \\&quot;stuff that made their hair SO soft\\&quot; and it lit up a light bulb in my head: Now I knew what I&#x27;d get them for Christmas! I decided I&#x27;d just come on here and pay the $12 or whatever and viola! It says $75 on the tub so I don&#x27;t look like a cheap ass. Haha. And it smells and makes my hair look/feel just like the stuff in the mall. So don&#x27;t listen to anybody else. Idk when those reveiws were written but maybe they were selling the wrong thing at first. Whatever the case, I got the real stuff so maybe they corrected the problem after seeing all the negative commenters.</li>
    <li> I am Asian with long hair. I love it. As leave on: the scent is good esp. after few hours. It works well after flat iron. As a mask: I think it is good as well. In my own opinion this product is for ALL types of hair. As a conditioner: The same as when you use it as a mask expect that mask works deeper. If you have time mask is always good.  Well recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> The product worked really well for my hair. Especially If i rinse my hair with conditioner after shampoo and then apply the hair mask for 5-8 minutes, makes such a difference in making my hair shiny and soft. The product itself does not come in the large bowl that is pictured. It&#x27;s a box with 5 medium sized tubes (still adds up to the same amount however)</li>
    <li> This is not the same as the ones I get from those sellers at the mall. It says made in china and is just not the same. The original product by the trua maker is an excellent product.[[ASIN:B001BIOPO2 Herstyler Mask [Health and Beauty]]]</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed in this product!! The photo and description are deceptive - shows the black container that is NOT the Argan Oil version, but what was shipped was indeed the&amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; brown Argan Oil container, smells terrible, not the fragrant stuff that you buy in the mall.  Do not waste your money on this product.  Made in Hong Kong.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask! I use it a couple times a week and it makes my hair so soft!! I recommend leaving it on for at least 5 minutes after shampooing your hair!&lt;br /&gt;I usually replace my normal conditioner with this when I use it!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT MAKES MY HAIR VERY HEALTHY AND SHINNY AND SOFT. I only use this 1 or 2 times a week in between other product I also use the serum my hair has never been healthier I will be a life long customer of this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair mask I have tried! My hair is so silky and smooth! First time I got one for like 13 $ this time I saw it for less and I bought 3 bcs they are amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this product works well and smells good, the girls in my family have discovered it and love it too.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t so happy not as good as the black container</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it did not have argon oil in the ingredients I received it today and it has argon oil in it .  I did not want argon oil it leaves my hair oily</li>
    <li> I have been using HerStyler products for years and I love it. My hair feels great to the touch and smells great.</li>
    <li> Make me hair look as feel like I just got a fresh hair cut supah healthy!</li>
    <li> If you have hair that&#x27;s been dyed, highlighted, styled &amp; processed I highly recommend this to you. Also great for naturally dry hair &amp; dry climates that strip your moisture away. Once a week do your regular shampoo, then comb this through &amp; either clip your hair up or wrap it in a towel or shower cap while you finish your shower. A good 10 - 20 minute treatment will leave your hair feeling soft, silky &amp; restored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear by Herstyler products. They&#x27;re all I use anymore, even expensive salon brands don&#x27;t seem to give me the same results. I recommend all their shampoos, conditioners &amp; hair serums. And at Amazon prices you can afford to try them without overspending.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!!&lt;br /&gt;People always ask me what hair product do I use!! My hair looks super healthy and shiny!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great price!&lt;br /&gt;Lovely aroma!!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful results!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it !!! Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I bought Herstyler from Amazon after I was given a sample from a Herstyler Rep at the mall. It smells exactly the same and got the same results as the sample. I really don&#x27;t care if its the same or not. The first thing I love about this stuff is the smell. It smells so good and I can smell it on myself all day long. I have even used it as a body wash because I love the smell so much. It does make my hair soft and shiny. Since my hair is fine and thin, I use just a little bit mixed with water. I leave it on for about 5 minutes and rinse with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the Herstyler website before I found it on Amazon. Herstyler wanted $70 for this stuff!!! That&#x27;s just nuts!</li>
    <li> This hair mask really does work. I like how it doesn&#x27;t way my hair down at all, it just leaves a nice, soft texture to my hair. The shipping was also very fast.</li>
