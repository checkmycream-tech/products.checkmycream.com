      <li>Definetly easy to use and apply the make-up.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery!</li>

      <li>It does not shed and is easy to clean.</li>

      <li>Worth the money!</li>

      <li>This brush is so soft I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>The brush arrived fairly quick, and it doesn&#x27;t absorb product.</li>
      <li>In fact, it&#x27;s about par with  most decent concealer brushes.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice brush, not limited to blending concealer.  </li>
      <li>Definitely not a smooth, comfortable or pleasant application experience.</li>
      <li>Very soft and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>These are amazing brushes and especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>It would also be suitable for shadow, especially for blending the edges.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a little firmer than cheaper options, which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s red</li>
      <li>Received this wonderful brush in the mail earlier this past week.  </li>
      <li>Exactly like I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Smashbox brushes never fail me.</li>
      <li>The brush is exactly what you would expect from Smashbox.</li>
      <li>Had it for a few months and it still in good condition.</li>
      <li>But if you are new to concealer brushes, I would try out a more price conscious option first to see if you even like working with a concealer brush altogether.</li>
      <li>Does it do a better job than other, more price conscious options, well ...</li>
      <li>Purchased this b/c I was in need of a decent concealer brush, one that had &#x27;precision&#x27;, as the name suggests, to help tighten up the points of my winged liner - this one does the trick!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this brush!</li>
      <li>I have a Smashbox powder brush that I love, and it too has natural bristles and a red handle.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and the packaging was super cute they also added small perfumes as a gift</li>
      <li>However, it was about $6, and that&#x27;s a bargain for a decent brush.</li>
      <li>I ordered this brush, mainly, because of the price.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend.great quality.</li>
      <li>The slightly pointed tip makes it easy to get into even the smallest crevices</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really use much thought I would but to busy in mornings to use different bushes for everything</li>
      <li>I think so far I have bought about 5 just to have them when I need them.</li>
      <li>The brush does not over absorb the makeup into the bristles so there is no waste of the makeup.</li>
      <li>brush is soft so no tugging of skin</li>
      <li>This concealer brush works great on patting a small dot of concealer on problem areas and hard to reach areas.</li>
      <li>I have never actually used a brush for concealer, so using this Smashbox Concealer brush was a new experience.  </li>
      <li>It has a flat shape with a rounded head and there are plenty of natural bristles.  </li>

<li> ^_^&lt;br /&gt;i needed something to put my concealer on from the small boxed shapes.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
<li> When the brush is wet with the product it hardens and becomes very stiff and when applying the concealer to the sentive under eye area it tends to poke and scratch the skin awkwardly.</li>
<li> This is not a good concealer brush at all.</li>

    <li> perfect for under eye</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really use much thought I would but to busy in mornings to use different bushes for everything&lt;br /&gt;wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Great brush for the area right under the bottom lashes.  I actually use it sometimes to &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush, mainly, because of the price. A Smashbox brush retails for about $20. The brush arrived fairly quick, and it doesn&#x27;t absorb product. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to go with my Stila concealer. It helps to cover ANY imperfection!!!! Great BUY!!! MUST GET IT!!</li>
    <li> just what i needed! ^_^&lt;br /&gt;i needed something to put my concealer on from the small boxed shapes.&lt;br /&gt;it prevents me from getting germs and bacteria on my face as well.</li>
    <li> Its a very dense concealer brush,  if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for in a concealer brush then this is the perfect one for you.  I use this brush to precision my eyebrows as I use the anastasia brow kit. Works great for that!</li>
    <li> good quality brush. love it!</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for small detail contouring or highlights.</li>

    <li> This brush is a deal for both the fact that it&#x27;s a smashbox and a great concealer brush.  I love that it&#x27;s red so it sticks out when I&#x27;m using my brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It doesn&#x27;t shed at all. It makes applying concealer super easy. I would highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> Larger than the average concealor brush which I like. Good coverage.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush, smooth application. Not sure what the bristles are made of, if anyone wants to give me a heads up? Very soft and easy to clean. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I am just beginning to use concealer. This brush was a great price and works well. It spreads the concealer evenly and feels good against my skin. Worth the price.</li>

    <li> I did not like this brush. It made my under eye wrinkles pop out.</li>
    <li> I have never actually used a brush for concealer, so using this Smashbox Concealer brush was a new experience.  It seemed to do  a great job.  The brush does not over absorb the makeup into the bristles so there is no waste of the makeup.</li>

    <li> Great! Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> It does its job as a concealer brush! However, you will need to go over it with a beauty blender or your finger to smooth out the brush strokes. It does not shed and is easy to clean. Does it do a better job than other, more price conscious options, well ... It&#x27;s definitely a little firmer than cheaper options, which is a good thing. But if you are new to concealer brushes, I would try out a more price conscious option first to see if you even like working with a concealer brush altogether.</li>
    <li> I am a freelance make-up artist. I have always loved the quality of Smashboxs&#x27; brushes. Easy to clean. Definetly easy to use and apply the make-up. Smashbox brushes never fail me.</li>
    <li> Not all that. It says for concealer but I have used better brushes. Elf has a great concealer brush from their studio line that only cost 3 dollars and is absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush, not limited to blending concealer.  It has a flat shape with a rounded head and there are plenty of natural bristles.  I have a Smashbox powder brush that I love, and it too has natural bristles and a red handle.  Presumably, they are from the same lot of brushes.  I have had my powder brush a number of years and it was very expensive, but totally worth it.  This small concealer brush was a great deal and a nice addition to my collection.  However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s limited to concealer blending.  It would also be suitable for shadow, especially for blending the edges.  I am actually thinking of buying another one for that specific purpose.  I&#x27;ll just have to label it so it doesn&#x27;t get mixed up!  I definitely recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft I absolutely love it! Shipping was fast and the packaging was super cute they also added small perfumes as a gift and it was a great price love everything!</li>
    <li> Pretty good, kind of big but still does its job. I like it</li>
    <li> Exactly like I thought it would be. Good price, concealer goes on easy with it. Need to clean it twice a month or so.</li>
    <li> Feels more expensive than it is. Lightweight when using it, and easy to clean. I recommend buying this. Had it for a few months and it still in good condition.</li>
    <li> Ive had this brush for over a month now. I use Mac liquid concealer. When the brush is wet with the product it hardens and becomes very stiff and when applying the concealer to the sentive under eye area it tends to poke and scratch the skin awkwardly. Definitely not a smooth, comfortable or pleasant application experience.</li>
    <li> This is not a good concealer brush at all. Once it touches concealer it clumps up and does not let you blend it in. And it&#x27;s rough so it hurts when it touches your face</li>
    <li> Received this wonderful brush in the mail earlier this past week.  Excellent quality, nice soft bristles yet securely made.  I found  I have used less concealer while applying it with this brush as compared to using my fingers. That&#x27;s a plus to me.  I plan on buying a foundation brush next.</li>
