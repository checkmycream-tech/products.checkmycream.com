      <li>It is another superior Cremo product to compliment  Cremo Shave Creme and  Cremo Face Moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used dozens of face washes from $2 to $26, and, for the price, this cleans better than any of them!</li>
      <li>and omg I love it!</li>

      <li>This stuff will get you REAL CLEAN.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cremo&#x27;s products for a couple years and the result is magical.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is also better than Cetaphil since it doesn&#x27;t include a pump, which I often find break.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s available here when that bottle runs out!</li>
      <li>I use more like a penny or nickle-sized amount.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Just like the Shaving Creme, I love this product.</li>
      <li>so much so that I often use the face wash in place of shaving cream in the shower on my face -- I get a great shave without a foamy or gel coating on my face.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I both use and love this.</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>Cremo lathers nicely, goes on and rinses off easily, and leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>It rinses off cleanly, which is very important for people like me with combination skin.</li>
      <li>I actually tried it for shaving and it worked surprisingly well!</li>
      <li>so it rinses off easily &amp; does not feel like you still have a layer of something on your face afterwards.  </li>
      <li>No scent, washes off clean, great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My face is doing great with the stuff and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my beard like many products.</li>
      <li>This is great facial cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Has greatly reduced breakouts from shaving regularly, which was a fixture when I didn&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
      <li>It does make my face feel clean though and rinses off easily.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic face wash.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance free, no added coloring, and leaves everything feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Comes off clean no residue.  </li>
      <li>This is straight up my favorite face wash ever.</li>
      <li>While it may be a bit pricey, the product makes up for the extra cost by being a superior product.  </li>
      <li>The wash lathers pretty well and washes away easily (unlike some face wash products).</li>
      <li>My new favorite face wash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found yet - cleans great, not too harsh, no fragrance.</li>
      <li>Minimal scent, reasonable price, great lather.</li>
      <li>It cleans my face right up and makes me feel FRESH.</li>
      <li>Not too drying or too moisturizing, just seems to be very skin friendly.</li>
      <li>Really makes your face &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean.  </li>
      <li>Very pleasant, low key scent, easy to use, and less carnage when all is said and done.</li>
      <li>All were nearly  brand new and very full.</li>
      <li>I have the skin of a 32 year old man who uses the right products for his face.</li>
      <li>Cremo easily rinses off and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
      <li>Unlike it&#x27;s competitors, after you wash your face it feels clean and with no lingering metro male odor.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>Many face washes were thick, did not go on or rinse off easily, had an undesirable fragrance, and left my skin irritated.</li>
      <li>Leaves facing feeling crisp and clear but has never dried my skin out.</li>
      <li>It is not a thick gel or cream</li>
      <li>I have used a number of face washes over the years, but Cremo Wash is great and it is not so expensive that you feel like to have to ration it every time you wash your face.</li>
      <li>As long as Cremo keeps making this stuff, I will be a loyal customer.</li>
      <li>and I did feel a little irritation when I use this, not bad but more so than other face washes</li>
      <li>I love Cremo Products, it is now the only shave product that I shave with, I would recommend this to everyone that wet shaves.</li>
      <li>At my present rate of use the bottle should last for more than 90 days which makes it a bargain overall.  </li>
      <li>you have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>For me, I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I no longer have the skin of a well disciplined 17 year old.</li>
      <li>Love how a little amount goes a long way as well</li>
      <li>It is also highly concentrated so a bottle goes a long way.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, it rinses clean, and has basically no scent.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff -- first it&#x27;s unscented -- a welcomed break from all of those bad cologne smelling men&#x27;s products.  </li>
      <li>It might seem peculiar to use a face wash other than soap, perhaps an unnecessary expense borne of clever advertising, but soap was made to &#x27;clean&#x27; skin, not prepare it for having a razor dragged across it.</li>
      <li>This face wash is a clear liquid with no scent that I could detect and goes on with minimal lather.  </li>

    <li> I have skin that gets too dry, too oily and even some odd third state if I don&#x27;t keep an eye on it. I&#x27;ve been using Cremo&#x27;s products for a couple years and the result is magical. I no longer have the skin of a well disciplined 17 year old. I have the skin of a 32 year old man who uses the right products for his face. Seriously, try it. No scent, washes off clean, great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Unlike it&#x27;s competitors, after you wash your face it feels clean and with no lingering metro male odor. Great product</li>
    <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. Does not dry out your skin at all and product lasts a long time before you need to replenish!</li>
    <li> I started using Cremo Cream Face Wash after years as a fan and user of Cetaphil.  Cremo Cream Face Wash lathers well, even while using much less than the quarter-sized amount that the bottle calls for.  I use more like a penny or nickle-sized amount.  Cremo easily rinses off and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  This is one of the best things about it.  The packaging is also better than Cetaphil since it doesn&#x27;t include a pump, which I often find break.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Comes off clean no residue.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve found yet - cleans great, not too harsh, no fragrance.</li>
    <li> This face wash is a clear liquid with no scent that I could detect and goes on with minimal lather.  For me, I have sensitive skin and I did feel a little irritation when I use this, not bad but more so than other face washes I have used before.  It does make my face feel clean though and rinses off easily.  I will use this over time to see how long term it affects my skin and see if I adjust to the slight irritation.  As a face cleaner, I like it but the slight irritation makes me give this 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The wash lathers pretty well and washes away easily (unlike some face wash products). Love how a little amount goes a long way as well</li>
    <li> This is truly a great product.  While it may be a bit pricey, the product makes up for the extra cost by being a superior product.  It is also highly concentrated so a bottle goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is not for me. Feels as though it waterproofed my skin with something that needs to wear off and can&#x27;t be washed off. It was weird.</li>
    <li> I love Cremo Products, it is now the only shave product that I shave with, I would recommend this to everyone that wet shaves.</li>
    <li> For my face, this is the best wash out there. Fragrance free, no added coloring, and leaves everything feeling clean. Has greatly reduced breakouts from shaving regularly, which was a fixture when I didn&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. I use it daily. It doesn&#x27;t dry me out. A little goes a long way. Try it!</li>
    <li> My new favorite face wash. I got it in a subscription box service and I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s available here when that bottle runs out! A little goes a long way, it rinses clean, and has basically no scent. My face is doing great with the stuff and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my beard like many products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of face washes from $2 to $26, and, for the price, this cleans better than any of them! As long as this keeps being produced, I&#x27;ll keep buying it! It rinses off cleanly, which is very important for people like me with combination skin. Minimal scent, reasonable price, great lather. All around amazing!</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleansing my face and prep for shaving.  Follow the directions on the bottle for the best results.  At my present rate of use the bottle should last for more than 90 days which makes it a bargain overall.  I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> I was running late for a flight and didn&#x27;t have time to check luggage. My face wash, moisturizer, and shaving cream got taken at airport security since it was too big. All were nearly  brand new and very full. I ordered replacements as soon as I landed. As long as Cremo keeps making this stuff, I will be a loyal customer. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks. It might seem peculiar to use a face wash other than soap, perhaps an unnecessary expense borne of clever advertising, but soap was made to &#x27;clean&#x27; skin, not prepare it for having a razor dragged across it. Subtle difference, no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, as a prep for wet shaving it does seem to make a difference. Very pleasant, low key scent, easy to use, and less carnage when all is said and done. Now part of my regular shaving routine.</li>
    <li> Really makes your face &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean.  Only takes a little to do a lot.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  My go-to.  Well recommended on other websites as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff will get you REAL CLEAN. I love it. I use it and the Cremo Face Moisturizer every night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t use it. My girlfriend HATES this stuff, she can&#x27;t use it or she will break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problems, though. It cleans my face right up and makes me feel FRESH. This is straight up my favorite face wash ever. I like it even better than all the expensive fancy crap my girlfriend tried to get me to use. Smells great, works great. Best face wash ever.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Unbeatable price.  Twice I&#x27;ve accidentally left a bottle of this at someone&#x27;s house while travelling and both times my host has called/written me to say &amp;#34;I used that face stuff you left at my house and omg I love it! Where do you get it?!!&amp;#34;  Good thing I get two bottles in ever order :) One to keep and one to share!</li>
    <li> Best face wash around.</li>
    <li> I have used a number of face washes over the years, but Cremo Wash is great and it is not so expensive that you feel like to have to ration it every time you wash your face.</li>
    <li> Best face wash by far of the two dozen or so that I have tried. Many face washes were thick, did not go on or rinse off easily, had an undesirable fragrance, and left my skin irritated. Cremo lathers nicely, goes on and rinses off easily, and leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed. It is another superior Cremo product to compliment  Cremo Shave Creme and  Cremo Face Moisturizer. You cannot go wrong with any Cremo product.</li>
    <li> This is great facial cleanser.  Not too drying or too moisturizing, just seems to be very skin friendly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best face wash</li>
    <li> This stuff really is amazing. Leaves facing feeling crisp and clear but has never dried my skin out.</li>
    <li> Just like the Shaving Creme, I love this product. does not leave your face tight and feeling dry. I am a committed customer to this product line.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use and love this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff -- first it&#x27;s unscented -- a welcomed break from all of those bad cologne smelling men&#x27;s products.  It is not a thick gel or cream so it rinses off easily &amp; does not feel like you still have a layer of something on your face afterwards.  It&#x27;s got almost a slick feel to it -- so much so that I often use the face wash in place of shaving cream in the shower on my face -- I get a great shave without a foamy or gel coating on my face.  hHghly recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just as described---great vendor and I look forward to ordering again!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic face wash.  Feels slippery during use.  I actually tried it for shaving and it worked surprisingly well!</li>
