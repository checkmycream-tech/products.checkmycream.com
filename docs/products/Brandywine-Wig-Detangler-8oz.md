    <li> Yes it works to detangle, but I had a cheap wig as part of an avengers dress up outfit and this product stayed wet on the wig for more than two days and stinks. Horrible, and won&#x27;t use it again. Maybe it dries faster on a good quality wig, I don&#x27;t know, but don&#x27;t buy for a cheap wig.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend for her Hatsune Miku wig. It didn&#x27;t work very well at getting or keeping tangles out. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> let me start by saying I threw the stuff in the trash. money down the drain. I used it on one of my wigs and it did not add shine. it did NOT detangle. if anything, it cause my wig to become a tangled mess over time and the more I used it the worse my wig became. I used it quite a few times throughout the day on one wig and by the end of the day my wig was a VERY snarly mess! and the ends became all fuzzy and frayed. and it was an expensive wig too. very unhappy.</li>
    <li> I use this for all of my CosPlay wigs, it is perfect!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>

    <li> This is a very nice, light conditioning spray for synthetic hair, and it does a great job of detangling and keeping the hair swingy and fresh when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little too heavy-handed, though -- why so much perfume in this? Shouldn&#x27;t I get to decide how I want to smell?  The bottle also leaks like crazy from the pump area of the cap. That part is poorly made.</li>
    <li> It worked great on my wigs, but *cough* way to much perfume I had to walk out of my room for a half hour to get the smell out bleh but it works Amazing on my cosplay wigs.</li>

    <li> This product is great and smells good too! I down rated to 4 because the sprayer broke before I had used half the bottle. Luckily I had an eyeglass lens cleaning spray bottle that works better than the original packaging. I will buy again despite this defect.</li>
