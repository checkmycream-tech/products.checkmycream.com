### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very happy with the Conair LWD400RCS.</li>
      <li>thing I like best about this one and</li>
      <li>I think this is a great shaver!</li>
      <li>If that works for you then this is just perfect.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been great ever since.  </li>
      <li>It shaves great.  </li>
      <li>Good thing it was discontinued.</li>
      <li>I recomend getting something else, and making sure you can find replacement cutters!</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for someone who travels because the shaver is nice and compact.</li>
      <li>Works better than they advertise -Good</li>
      <li>strongly Recommend it!</li>
      <li>The razor is very cheaply constructed and I would not recommend this to anyone.  </li>
      <li>But I think there are better shavers out there with more value.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off spending twice the money to get a durable machine.</li>
      <li>make sure you can get replacement parts for the model you buy or 2.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m satisfied w/ this product.</li>
      <li>Pretty good shaver, easy to handle light weight, fair price</li>
      <li>This is the first time buying or using an electric razor, but it was definitely a good purchase, it gave a good close shave from the very first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good razor.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The shavers does a good job and does not irritating &lt;br /&gt;sensitive</li>
      <li>It comes in a cute little lavender pouch and it&#x27;s the perfect size.  </li>
      <li>Hey this is tiny, cute, nice color, nice zip up carrier which holds everything including the compact charger.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a Perfect little compact shaver easy to use + clean.</li>
      <li>the Revlon is the size - who needs those huge handles like the others</li>
      <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to clean too.  </li>
      <li>I can barely get through a good shave of both legs on one charge.</li>
      <li>Previously I had a battery-operated Revlon one that I bought for $5 at a drugstore that worked great until the foils wore out (doesn&#x27;t seem to be on market anymore), and a Remington Smooth &amp; Silky that kept falling apart</li>
      <li>, you probably need to buy new blades for it more often than I do.</li>
      <li>If you absolutely MUST have completely smooth legs, don&#x27;t buy an electric shaver.</li>
      <li>It shaves really smooth and is really fast.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had much success with this shaver.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even okay to use on the sensitive parts of your body.  </li>
      <li>I previously had a Remington Shaver which was good until it broke.  </li>
      <li>Not bad for a quick, not too precise trim, but the traditional shaving cream and regular razor is STILL faster and more thorough.  </li>
      <li>okay, but what good is a razor that only works half the time?</li>
      <li>/&gt;It worked well at first, for about 6 months, then it started going downhill.</li>
      <li>That is more of a nuisance, especially when traveling.</li>
      <li>This shaver is better than any I have had in a long time.</li>
      <li>Works fine for the first few months, but then the battery doesn&#x27;t want to recharge to full capacity.  </li>
      <li>buy one cheap enough that you won&#x27;t care if you just have to buy another whole unit.</li>
      <li>It works well on bikini line and underarms, but on the legs will never feel as close as a razor shave, although you can&#x27;t really see any hairs.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money on a replacement shaver</li>
      <li>Others here have noted the short battery life and change in sound when it&#x27;s losing power.</li>
      <li>This thing is very scratchy.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot on a replacement shaver, and saw this one on amazon.  </li>
      <li>and it shaves very closely.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it on sensitive areas of my body such as my underarms and my bikini line, and it&#x27;s done just fine;</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t even shave as well as my normal razor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller than my previous shaver and it fits nicely in the travel bag</li>
      <li>As a result it doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough to really \\&quot;cut\\&quot; anything, it just catches and hurts and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used much better electric shavers in the past.</li>
      <li>only major problem with it is that I need a new foil and can&#x27;t seem to get through to the Conair replacement parts phone line, and none seem to be available online, so take that into consideration when purchasing a shaver - the foils will wear out after a year or two of regular use and it will start to hurt.</li>
      <li>This is my second shaver, this one works much better than my previous.  </li>
      <li>(the head popped off nearly every time I set it on it&#x27;s side) and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge - threw it out after a while out of frustration.  </li>
      <li>This thing is horrible...doesn&#x27;t cut very close, certainly doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, engine noise slows down and dies out after about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>I really like my Conair Ladies Wet/Dry Shaver , I have always wanted one and due to health problems</li>
      <li>I like it so much that I&#x27;m looking for a wet dry razor for my husband now.</li>

<li> Besides the fact that its not a close shave the battery life on this sucks so much, since you have to go over each area like 2 or 3 times</li>
<li> I had a Remington a long time ago, and then a Panasonic, and I think I&#x27;ll try one of those again.</li>
<li> I find it hard to hard to get a close shave but easy to scrape my skin.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use it as a wet shaver only dry shave.</li>
<li> Mine does sound \\&quot;slower\\&quot; when it&#x27;s yanking the hair, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to battery charge (e.g. it can start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode, and then straighten up and shave right five minutes in!)</li>
<li> you only get to shave like a leg and a half.</li>
<li> I just use these shavers dry, maybe tried wet once</li>
<li> I previously used a Remington shaver which broke on me after three years of constant use.  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t take as long as some of the other reviewers said either, you can shave while watching tv even-</li>
<li> I bought this a few months ago, and after about three or four shaves it stopped working properly.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t work after 3 months even though I used it even less than 10 times each month.</li>
<li> My previous shaver was a little bulky, but this one I think is small enough to travel with but not too small in regards to handling it.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t pull them all the way out, which is even worse because it means you have to go over and over the same spots if your desperate enough to continue.  </li>
<li> The shave started getting &#x27;spotty&#x27; (leaving uncut hairs) after only about 10 shaves.</li>
<li> It was a waste of money!</li>
<li> Also, it sits poorly in it&#x27;s charging base, making it difficult to get a good charge.</li>
<li> I would give it negative stars but that wasn&#x27;t an option.</li>
<li> As a few others have noted, the battery on this is... questionable.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t use it THAT much, so I am disappointed it didn&#x27;t last longer.</li>
<li> I was skeptical because it was cheaper than others I have had, but it works like a charm for me.</li>
<li> Seriously the razor burn was horribly painful even with shaving creams.</li>
<li> Too bad, I cannot return it.</li>
<li> It yanks on the hairs instead of cutting them, which is very painful!</li>
<li> The battery life is the worst of any electric razor</li>
<li> the horrible razor burn!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used much better electric shavers in the past. I find it hard to hard to get a close shave but easy to scrape my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 2 years. &lt;br /&gt;It worked well at first, for about 6 months, then it started going downhill. It does not hold a charge well. I can barely get through a good shave of both legs on one charge. The motor sounds noticably &#x27;slower&#x27; than it did in the beginning. &lt;br /&gt;Also, you probably need to buy new blades for it more often than I do. The shave started getting &#x27;spotty&#x27; (leaving uncut hairs) after only about 10 shaves. &lt;br /&gt;Again, it&#x27;s alright, especially for the price. But I think there are better shavers out there with more value.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t even shave as well as my normal razor. It was a waste of money!</li>
    <li> The battery life is the worst of any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  The razor doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave and mine broke after just three uses.  The razor is very cheaply constructed and I would not recommend this to anyone.  You&#x27;re better off spending twice the money to get a durable machine.</li>
    <li> I would give it negative stars but that wasn&#x27;t an option. This thing is horrible...doesn&#x27;t cut very close, certainly doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, engine noise slows down and dies out after about 5 minutes. And oh yeah...the horrible razor burn!!! Seriously the razor burn was horribly painful even with shaving creams.</li>
    <li> This is the third wet/dry women&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve owned in 7 years. Previously I had a battery-operated Revlon one that I bought for $5 at a drugstore that worked great until the foils wore out (doesn&#x27;t seem to be on market anymore), and a Remington Smooth &amp; Silky that kept falling apart (the head popped off nearly every time I set it on it&#x27;s side) and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge - threw it out after a while out of frustration.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The thing I like best about this one and the Revlon is the size - who needs those huge handles like the others have?? That is more of a nuisance, especially when traveling. It works well on bikini line and underarms, but on the legs will never feel as close as a razor shave, although you can&#x27;t really see any hairs. If you absolutely MUST have completely smooth legs, don&#x27;t buy an electric shaver. However, once you get used to the convenience of these shavers you will never want to switch back; it takes about 3 minutes to do my legs, underarms and entire bikini area brazilian once a week. Note: I sugared my bikini area for a year so the hair there is thinner than it once was. I just use these shavers dry, maybe tried wet once but there was no noticeable difference. I have never had a problem with it keeping a charge, but I recharge it after every use. Have never had a problem with it losing it&#x27;s charge while traveling either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only major problem with it is that I need a new foil and can&#x27;t seem to get through to the Conair replacement parts phone line, and none seem to be available online, so take that into consideration when purchasing a shaver - the foils will wear out after a year or two of regular use and it will start to hurt. Either 1. make sure you can get replacement parts for the model you buy or 2. buy one cheap enough that you won&#x27;t care if you just have to buy another whole unit.</li>
    <li> I have never had an electric razor, I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.  It shaves really smooth and is really fast.  It&#x27;s super easy to clean too.  I like that I can use it in the shower with soap.  I like it so much that I&#x27;m looking for a wet dry razor for my husband now.</li>
    <li> I previously used a Remington shaver which broke on me after three years of constant use.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money on a replacement shaver and I saw this one on Amazon.  I ordered it and it&#x27;s been great ever since.  It shaves great.  It&#x27;s even okay to use on the sensitive parts of your body.  It comes in a cute little lavender pouch and it&#x27;s the perfect size.  My previous shaver was a little bulky, but this one I think is small enough to travel with but not too small in regards to handling it.  Overall I think it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 6+ years and it&#x27;s still working! it&#x27;s a Perfect little compact shaver easy to use + clean. strongly Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Conair LWD400RCS. &lt;br /&gt;The shavers does a good job and does not irritating &lt;br /&gt;sensitive skin. I would purchase it again. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work after 3 months even though I used it even less than 10 times each month. Although its motor is till running, but it cannot remove any hair from my skin. Too bad, I cannot return it.</li>
    <li> Besides the fact that its not a close shave the battery life on this sucks so much, since you have to go over each area like 2 or 3 times you only get to shave like a leg and a half. If that works for you then this is just perfect.</li>
    <li> This shaver is better than any I have had in a long time. I was skeptical because it was cheaper than others I have had, but it works like a charm for me.</li>
    <li> stopped working from the very second use. bought 2 pieces, both stopped working. Not worth the money. Totally unsatisifed.</li>
    <li> I find this works well for me. I don&#x27;t use it as a wet shaver only dry shave. I recommend this product for someone who travels because the shaver is nice and compact. I&#x27;ve had much success with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago, and after about three or four shaves it stopped working properly. It yanks on the hairs instead of cutting them, which is very painful! It doesn&#x27;t pull them all the way out, which is even worse because it means you have to go over and over the same spots if your desperate enough to continue.  Sometimes it works okay, but what good is a razor that only works half the time? Others here have noted the short battery life and change in sound when it&#x27;s losing power. Mine does sound \\&quot;slower\\&quot; when it&#x27;s yanking the hair, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to battery charge (e.g. it can start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode, and then straighten up and shave right five minutes in!) Even when not pulling hair, the shave is not close. Definitely find a different razor!</li>
    <li> I cannot use it because of the battery it last just a second, I try to charge it as it says in the manual, but it didnt work at all. I try to ask to chage it because of that, but I dont want the same this time</li>
    <li> Works fine for the first few months, but then the battery doesn&#x27;t want to recharge to full capacity.  As a result it doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough to really \\&quot;cut\\&quot; anything, it just catches and hurts and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is the first time buying or using an electric razor, but it was definitely a good purchase, it gave a good close shave from the very first time I used it.  It didn&#x27;t take as long as some of the other reviewers said either, you can shave while watching tv even- I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Hey this is tiny, cute, nice color, nice zip up carrier which holds everything including the compact charger.  Works better than they advertise -Good deal - BUT - I have updated my review because after 2 1/2 years the blade has fallen out and it&#x27;s irreparible.  I didn&#x27;t use it THAT much, so I am disappointed it didn&#x27;t last longer.</li>
    <li> Not bad for a quick, not too precise trim, but the traditional shaving cream and regular razor is STILL faster and more thorough.  Also, it sits poorly in it&#x27;s charging base, making it difficult to get a good charge.</li>
    <li> I really like my Conair Ladies Wet/Dry Shaver , I have always wanted one and due to health problems I was advised to get one.</li>
    <li> This thing is very scratchy.  It left red lines all over my skin.  Good thing it was discontinued.</li>
    <li> As a few others have noted, the battery on this is... questionable. I had a Remington a long time ago, and then a Panasonic, and I think I&#x27;ll try one of those again. I bought this in Feb of &#x27;03 here with a Gold Box discount for $36 total, and it seems too soon for it to stop working.</li>
    <li> This is my second shaver, this one works much better than my previous.  However- I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year, and can&#x27;t find replacement cutters anywhere for it.  Therefore, it doesn&#x27;t cut well anymore!  I recomend getting something else, and making sure you can find replacement cutters!</li>
    <li> I previously had a Remington Shaver which was good until it broke.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot on a replacement shaver, and saw this one on amazon.  It&#x27;s a pretty good razor.  I&#x27;ve used it twice now since I&#x27;ve gotten it and it shaves very closely.  I&#x27;ve used it on sensitive areas of my body such as my underarms and my bikini line, and it&#x27;s done just fine; no problems at all.  It&#x27;s smaller than my previous shaver and it fits nicely in the travel bag it comes in with.  I think this is a great shaver!</li>
    <li> Pretty good shaver, easy to handle light weight, fair price, I&#x27;m satisfied w/ this product.</li>
