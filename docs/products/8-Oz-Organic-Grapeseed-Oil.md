      <li>I cannot get enough of Dr. Adorable&#x27;s unrefined oils.</li>
      <li>I am a skin care therapist, so I love to incorporate different unrefined oils into my every day regimen.</li>

      <li>I bought this for my mom to use because she has rosacea, and I heard this product can really help.</li>
      <li>I mixed it 30% along with 40%  Evening Primrose Oil, and 30% sweet almond oil.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try because it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive compared to over-the-counter skin products.</li>
      <li>Package was left on the front porch and the bottle was only 1/4 filled with oil.</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t realize that it would clear his skin in this manner.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy on your hair, but it leaves you hair very moisturized at the same time.  </li>
      <li>, the shape of the bottle does not make it easy to pour a small amount without spilling a lot of the product.</li>

    <li> Not a fan of plastic, but what can you do.  This is a nice product and I have bought many products from Dr. Adorable.  I have been happy with all of my purchases and you can&#x27;t beat the price or the fast shipping. I make my own combo face oils, using cold pressed castor oil.  I believe this helps me not break out and my skin is so much more healthier.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and my skin looks like I am in my 30&#x27;s so I have been told.</li>
    <li> Really good quality butter! I order from this company a lot because I feel that I&#x27;m purchasing quality. My man&#x27;s father had a really bad case of eczema from Chemotherapy, his skin looked like that of an alligator and he could not find relief to get any sleep. I purchase these butters and made a body butter and in about a week and a half, his skin was totally clear from the dry patches that he had previously suffered from. I was trying to help him sleep, I didn&#x27;t realize that it would clear his skin in this manner. Very high quality oils to mix inside your butters or to just place in your bath water. Thanks to the company for putting such a great product out there.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. High quality and cold pressed (chemical free) I use this on my face as a moisturizer and I will never go back to lotions again. It gives me moisture and nutrients for my skin without making me break out. A little goes a long way! I bought this like over 6 months ago and I still have 3/4 of it left. Great for the whole body after bath or shower too!</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast, well packaged, and the shipper was really nice too. Sent me an e-mail (and responded quickly when I told them I accidentally gave the wrong address). The oil seems to be good quality, and also does not have a smell to it (as a carrier oil shouldn&#x27;t) so this isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; oil. Check out essential oils for that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it for OCM with some other oils from this guy too. Worked well and came off as easily as you can expect it to. Overall great product and quick shipping (ordered sunday, got it wednesday).</li>
    <li> Great oils from this company! Keep up the GREAT job and price. Will alway use your oils exclusively. Many Thanks!</li>
    <li> I cannot get enough of Dr. Adorable&#x27;s unrefined oils. I first purchased their Argan oil to incorporate in my skin regimen and was not disappointed. I am a skin care therapist, so I love to incorporate different unrefined oils into my every day regimen. I now have 3 of there oils and have been very pleased.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair as well as my face and body it soaks right into Ur skin leaving u very soft and smooth</li>
    <li> This is a nice oil. It&#x27;s very light, and it absorbs quickly and easily. I use it in body lotion and hair conditioning mixtures that I make myself.</li>
    <li> love the company&#x27;s products. grape-seed oil is great for many uses.</li>
    <li> Using this oil for the Oil Cleanse Method of face care/washing. It it known for being a bit more drying than most oils so I only use a 1/3 blend with the jojoba and argan that I also own. So far so good! No strong smell and bottle was sealed properly upon delivery.</li>
    <li> Awesome shipping and price, not much to say about the product, it&#x27;s Organic Grapeseed Oil!! Lol. Feels very nice and light. I bought this for my mom to use because she has rosacea, and I heard this product can really help. I mixed it 30% along with 40%  Evening Primrose Oil, and 30% sweet almond oil. Also added a couple drops of Eucalyptus EO, Lavender EO, Clary Sage EO, and Tea Tree EO. This all using the OCM (Oil Cleansing Method) look it up!! :)</li>
    <li> This has been a great product! I use it on my face with essential oils and it works perfectly! Awesome!!</li>
    <li> I loved the oil it worked for my needs and will purchase again in the future&lt;br /&gt;Great great great great</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to test this product by itself but I use it in my homemade shea butter</li>
    <li> good product good price</li>
    <li> feels great ! I love all the Dr. Adorable oils, except for castor but it has its positives. Mind you they are very few but there are some. As for the grapeseed oil it feels great and makes my skin feel smooth. I do not like any of the caps these bottles come with so do yourself a favor and order replacement caps and/or bottles with flip top spouts. Otherwise you will have a mess on your hands... literally.</li>
    <li> I received this package thru USPS and it was wrapped in another plastic container with oil dripping everywhere. Package was left on the front porch and the bottle was only 1/4 filled with oil. How will you make up for this? I threw the whole bottle away because it had been contaminated with the broken CAP. You should have a thought of a better packaging.</li>
    <li> I ordered the grapeseed oil for use in my beauty products and I could not be happier. the product arrived in good condition. sealed no trace of tampering or cross contamination.</li>
    <li> Grapeseed oil has emerged as an ideal oil to use on your facial skin. There are some commercial products that contain this oil. A cheaper and more effective way of using it is to simply use the oil on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nutrient-rich oil is derived from grape seeds. It is rich in antioxidants and OPCs, otherwise known as oligomeric proanthocyanidin complexes. The benefits of grapeseed oil for your skin include anti-aging benefits, supple skin, and an even skin tone. While it works well for most skin types, it may prove to be too greasy for the oiliest skin. It&#x27;s worth a try because it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive compared to over-the-counter skin products. Try Now Foods, Grape Seed Oil, $5.10, amazon.com, and keep your skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> you can use it alone or add it to other oils for softer skin.... great buy... love it and the price was good</li>
    <li> I want to say that the quality of the product is a five. The bottle that it comes in would be about a 1 or a 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how hard I try, the shape of the bottle does not make it easy to pour a small amount without spilling a lot of the product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It is not greasy on your hair, but it leaves you hair very moisturized at the same time.  I have ordered it 3 times total.  The is now a staple in my oil collection.</li>
    <li> best brand i ever used</li>
