      <li>This body wash is great and it is not harsh on my skin.</li>
      <li>great on our sensitive skin and still has lots of skin nourishment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The sensitive skin formula may have changed a bit over time, but it&#x27;s been great</li>
      <li>Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I will never understand the soaps from mainstream, and sometimes otherwise great brands, who claim to have a line of \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; products which still contain Sodium Lauryl or Laureth (as in this case) Sulfate.</li>
      <li>Good products, fast delivery, receipt of combination.</li>
      <li>Love Dove and the price was great for the multiple bottles that i got.</li>
      <li>This wash leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy, and nourished.</li>
      <li>Since I was found to have Chemical Dermatitis - I have had to switch to products that rinse easily.</li>
      <li>Very light fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>It actually turned out to be a great &#x27;shaving cream&#x27; for me as well.  </li>
      <li>a favor - ditch the fruity, scented, cheap soap and treat your skin with care.</li>
      <li>its cheap, 4 bottles for 20 bucks.</li>
      <li>Hypoallergenic, soap free, unscented, that moisturizers your skin.  </li>
      <li>This is very lathery and nice body wash.</li>
      <li>It also as a rich creamy lather.  </li>
      <li>so you feel clean after using it.</li>
      <li>I really like the dove clean and moist, this ones ok.</li>
      <li>Mild and fresh, lightly scented.</li>
      <li>The soap smells fine, does it&#x27;s job of getting the dirt off of us, and most importantly is one of the only soaps that doesn&#x27;t irritate my son&#x27;s or my skin.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I have to choose my products carefully, so I love that this contains no dyes or perfumes.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I have the driest, most sensitive skin out there.</li>
      <li>These are not moisturizing like the regular kind.</li>
      <li>Those of us using this product most likely are using it because we love it so much, or because you have to.</li>
      <li>I love and use all of the Dove Sensitive skin products.</li>
      <li>I bought it on a lighting deal so the price was right as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The sensitive skin formula definitely has a perfume smell, but it&#x27;s pleasant and not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I have never had a problem with any formulation, but the sensitive skin is very mild.</li>
      <li>I also use it in lieu of Summer&#x27;s Eve at the recommendation of my gyno, and it seems to be super gentle.</li>
      <li>Very mild for sensitive skin yet gets the job done.  </li>
      <li>I bought the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; because that&#x27;s all they had in stock, but the scent is actually pretty strong, and I&#x27;m not even sensitive to scents.</li>
      <li>The scent of this wash reminds me very much of what I remember of the scent of the Dove bar soap.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love using this shower soap.</li>
    <li> I love Dove Body Wash. I have never had a problem with any formulation, but the sensitive skin is very mild.</li>
    <li> Very mild for sensitive skin yet gets the job done.  Hypoallergenic, soap free, unscented, that moisturizers your skin.  I bought it on a lighting deal so the price was right as well.</li>
    <li> cant get enough of this</li>
    <li> prevents itchy dry skin with grease or oil--highly recommended</li>
    <li> Finally a commercial soap that lives up to their claim.This bodywash doesn&#x27;t dry out skin because it is more like a thick lotion cream. It doesn&#x27;t lather so for those who do not know most of everything that lather will dry your skin and hair out thats why this works. Has fragrance but it is a neutral smell. The only commercial soap i would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this Dove body wash for years and I love it.  Because it is for sensitive skin, I have no trouble using it.  I find it leaves my skin softer and more moisturized than other products I have tried.  I highly recommend this body wash.</li>
    <li> I bought the sensitive body wash at rite aid for 2 for 12 (24 oz) and they give you a 4 dollar coupon back. At first I was skeptical because it does have a fragrance and I have very sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I&#x27;ve had no problems. It lathers very, very well with a shower poof and makes your skin soft. I can also use it for shaving win/ win. It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t rid your body of the natural oils it needs. It&#x27;s scent is also very nice, not too strong. It smells like the dove bar soap which I love.</li>
    <li> I will never understand the soaps from mainstream, and sometimes otherwise great brands, who claim to have a line of \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; products which still contain Sodium Lauryl or Laureth (as in this case) Sulfate. If you&#x27;re someone who needs sensitive skin products there&#x27;s a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without SLS. Boo. Refer to their bar soap, which is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! This what I have to use and its a doctor&#x27;s order and buying it at my local stores can be expensive. I find this the best place to get it.</li>
    <li> Love Dove and the price was great for the multiple bottles that i got. Will def get this again. Def</li>
    <li> This used to be much thicker.  I have used the same product for 3 years and this last batch is much thinner.  Guess they must have watered it down rather than raise the price.  It still works, but just lasts for a shorter time.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and can only use Dove sensitive skin. I normally purchase it at Sam&#x27;s club however Amazon has a better price for four versus the three I purchased at Sam&#x27;s Club.  I also like that this was sent via Prime</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product before and have sensitive skin, you will really like it.  It is gentle enough for my toddler to use everyday, and it has a mild, pleasant scent.  I can&#x27;t remember how much I paid for it on Amazon, but it was a little less expensive here than it is at our local store.</li>
    <li> It was cheap and exactly the product my girlfriend uses because she has sensitive skin.  This product helps her skin a lot.</li>
    <li> Any of Dove&#x27;s body wash meet my expectations. I always use the exfoliating one but I tried this for a change &amp; it&#x27;s also good.</li>
    <li> This was a great bargain, worked out cheaper than if I had purchased them at a wholesale discount store plus it was elegible for free shipment...BONUS</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive  (senior) skin .Bar soaps didn&#x27;t work for me but this one does. I&#x27;m  very satisfied with this product and ordered more than one.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have very dry and sensitive skin and it works great.  My entire family love it.  .</li>
    <li> The girls in family use this and only this. They react to most with smell added. Good product, will buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a big bottle, but doesn&#x27;t lather that much which I like. Otherwise it did a good job at keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Despite saying unscented on the bottle it does have a scent albeit a light pleasant one. I have seen an improvement when using this for my dry skin as it actually moisturizes my body better than my last body wash. Like others I&#x27;m completely baffled with the bottle design as it really is impossible to get the last bit out.</li>
    <li> The dove body wash for sensitive skin. It is was the best choice. We have 4 months old twins, we even use it on them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this cleanser. It smells terrible, leaves it&#x27;s scent on you after rinsing, and contains fragrance halfway down the ingredients list despite saying &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; on the label. My oily (but very sensitive) skin didn&#x27;t feel completely clean after use, and it left dark areas on my feet when unusually dirty. I tried it for a few weeks and still got dry skin on my arms after spending an afternoon in the sun (no sunburn).</li>
    <li> I have the hardest time with lotions and body washes because I have very sensitive skin as well as eczema. This body wash is great and it is not harsh on my skin. Dove products are usually very good but the scented ones irritate, but this one has a clean smell and does not irritate. I will be purchasing again soon.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to a lot or body soap.  This is one of the few I can use. Great lather; leaves me feeling nice and clean.</li>
    <li> This product is super for dry skin.  I don&#x27;t have to use lotion as nearly as much.  Plus, the price on subscribe and save is really great!</li>
    <li> My skin is super sensitive so I have to be careful what I put on it.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years.  It&#x27;s the best soap I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
    <li> This was bought for my niece who has super sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use just any soap or body wash from any department or drug store. Her dry patches were gone and redness was reduced. Highly recommend especially if used with a loofah or brush.</li>
    <li> I really like this bodywash.  It&#x27;s thick and creamy, makes a nice lather when used with a pouf, and is very gentle.  I use it with my hand on my radiated skin and still get a nice creamy lather.  Very light fresh scent.  I bought 4 bottles and they will last a long time, but I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> This body wash is both very affordable and a bit of a luxury, compared to bar soap. I have very sensitive skin, so I have to choose my products carefully, so I love that this contains no dyes or perfumes.</li>
    <li> like  it but I have trouble  using it as hands are not strong.Feels heavy for me but  contents are good.</li>
    <li> Shame  on Dove!  This is NOT an &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; product as it clearly shows on the bottle.  I am highly allergic/sensitive to chemical smells ie perfumes etc.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed  :(.</li>
    <li> Great body wash at a great price.  Subscribe and save is awesome!</li>
    <li> Since I was found to have Chemical Dermatitis - I have had to switch to products that rinse easily.</li>
    <li> I got the Sensitive Skin one and I like it. Seems like a good deal to me, comes in a 4 pack.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. I have extremely sensitive, dry skin and this product really helps with the dryness without aggravating any allergies. This body wash has hardly any scent and foams up really well so you feel clean after using it. Your skin is lft softer than it as before use, so a heavy moisturiser is not required after the shower. I have been using this for the better part of a year and do not have a single complaint.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have the driest, most sensitive skin out there. This is the only body wash I can use that doesn’t make me feel like my skin is tightening up as soon as I dry off after the shower.</li>
    <li> After dermatologists tried to get me to &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; with different lotions and washes after I had an adverse reaction to waxing, I gave up hope that anything would help. I tried this body wash on a whim and both me and my boyfriend noticed a difference within a month. I won&#x27;t go with anything else from now on and I definitely won&#x27;t be a guinea pig for a dermatologist again.</li>
    <li> I was waiting for some lotion in the mail, and used this item hoping it would keep me moisturized enough to not need lotion for a day. It did a great job. Even though I have lotion now, I still think this is an excellent addition to keeping your skin refreshed!</li>
    <li> This is very lathery and nice body wash. Family members love it. It does a good job washing your body.</li>
    <li> Dove Body Wash with NutriMoisture, Sensitive Skin, 24 Ounce Bottles,  Needed something for allergies as I am allergic to most soaps.  This is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Relief when washing and raking a bath!  I have sensitive skin as I have since learned. I was scratching, itching and  I had a rash with other body washes. I gave up on bar soaps many years ago for the same reason. I decided to with this product, and my skin is clearing up and when I finish bathing, you can feel the difference. I highly recommend this product. I plan on buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Before this I was using Dove VisibleCare because I loved the scent, but after a year or so I noticed my skin was a lot drier than before. I switched to this sensitive skin body wash and within two weeks my skin was back to normal. I also love the subtle, clean smell.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this body wash, but I think it smells awful like lye soap. But it does not irritates his skin as other body washes, so he is sticking with it.</li>
    <li> I use this product on both my son and I.  I&#x27;ve used on my son since birth.  The baby soaps dried out his skin so his pediatrician recommend Dove.  We&#x27;ll never use anything else. I get really dry legs and I still have to lotion, but they are no where near as dry since I&#x27;ve started using this product.  It gets an A+ in our house!  Doesn&#x27;t have all the harsh chemicals  or dyes and perfumes that other soaps have.</li>
    <li> My son and I have sensitive skin and I really needed a &amp;#34;free and clear&amp;#34; body wash that we both could use.&lt;br /&gt;Its great on our sensitive skin and still has lots of skin nourishment.&lt;br /&gt;The skin does not feel dry after like some other products for those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great Job, Dove!</li>
    <li> Whole family loves this stuff. Me I&#x27;m kind of neutral. It seems like I&#x27;m using Jergens hand lotion. Kept having to squint at the bottle to make sure it was soap. Never used before but you don&#x27;t waste soap like in many body wash brands. Its more thick and not as runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a quality product with the name to go with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. The previous Dove body lotion seemed to cause skin itching. This one solved that problem.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years BUT the new formula has a new odor that I am reacting to....I will not be able to use this any more....:(</li>
    <li> Most of the family has sensitive skin and this body wash is great for this. Leaves your skin feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love the oil content in the soap.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and cannot use drying or harsh washes, and this does not bother me at all.  It actually turned out to be a great &#x27;shaving cream&#x27; for me as well.  My poor legs would be destroyed by other products, but this seemed to protect them.  I also use it in lieu of Summer&#x27;s Eve at the recommendation of my gyno, and it seems to be super gentle.</li>
    <li> There was a great improvement of my skin even after the first shower.</li>
    <li> I have asthma. I am also extremely sensitive to scents. As such, it is often very difficult for me to find products that don&#x27;t burn my lungs, cause me to sneeze all day, or just generally irritate me enough that I rush to wash them off.  This body wash has very little scent as promised.  It&#x27;s also creamy and makes my skin feel soft for hours.</li>
    <li> donot particuarly care for the scent, but nice feel to the skin!</li>
    <li> Good products, fast delivery, receipt of combination.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Mild and fresh, lightly scented.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to address the several complaints that this is too thick, and the bottles are too stiff.  I popped up the cap on the first bottle and was surprised to see the relatively large, straw-sized opening.  For crying out loud.  When the bottle runs low, stick the thing up to the shower head and let water get in.  Close cap, shake, open, pour.  The soap gets diluted on the washcloth anyway.  You can use the bottle down to totally empty, with zero effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive skin formula definitely has a perfume smell, but it&#x27;s pleasant and not overpowering.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought this wash.  Shall continue to use it.</li>
    <li> You only need a few drops of this and it is enough. It is very moisturizing and leaves my skin clean and soft with no residual sticky film and it doesn&#x27;t have all those extra fragrances. Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Does the job and keeps skin soft.  That said, the price is a bit steep considering that the same stuff in the up and up brand at Target is less than half the price.</li>
    <li> Why spend 6-9 dollars at the grocery store or box store when you can buy a supply here and save? Those of us using this product most likely are using it because we love it so much, or because you have to. I have been using the sensitive skin version for nearly 2.5 years, and dont see myself switching. As for the product itself, it leaves my skin feeling healthy, never excessively dry or greasy (thats a lot to say for a 21 year old male). Seems to leave my skin feeling good all day, even after cycling or sitting at work all day.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and I have no issues with this one. A+</li>
    <li> Love it. My dermatologist recommended it...</li>
    <li> I grew up with Dove bar soap because it was my mom&#x27;s choice.  The scent of this wash reminds me very much of what I remember of the scent of the Dove bar soap.  To me, it&#x27;s a typical clean scent.  This wash is pretty thick and feels very smooth going on.  My skins feels moisturized after it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this during a lightning deal, great price, great scent :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again even without the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LS</li>
    <li> Great product and great scheduled deliveries.  I get it for my youngest son, who lives in a group home. Not sure what they do with it all, but at least he&#x27;s clean!</li>
    <li> I really like the dove clean and moist, this ones ok. its cheap, 4 bottles for 20 bucks. cant find a better deal than that</li>
    <li> How is this unscented? It has fragrance in it! I bought it, used it, and broke out terribly from the perfumes in it. \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; is listed in the ingredients on the bottle.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel so good after my shower or bath</li>
    <li> Definitely not Unscented. The front of the bottle clearly states \\&quot;Unscented\\&quot;  I used it and immediately noticed a perfume-like smell.  \\&quot;How can this be?\\&quot; I asked myself.  Turned the bottle around, read the ingredients, and guess what...\\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; is listed.  Okay, so why would Dove label something as \\&quot;Unscented\\&quot; that clearly is not? Geesh, how silly of me to think \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; means no fragrance added.  Very frustrating!</li>
    <li> I used to love this body wash, but they recently (within the last few months) changed the formula to have a strong smell. I don&#x27;t think they should continue to call it &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; when it has such a powerful perfume. I won&#x27;t buy again until they make it unscented.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove&#x27;s sensitive skin body wash for years. I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist in the past for treatment and recommendations, and Dove works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive skin formula may have changed a bit over time, but it&#x27;s been great and I haven&#x27;t had any qualms about it. I&#x27;m such a creature of habit that I feel naked without it on the road. This wash leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy, and nourished. There might be a tiny, tiny scent, but it&#x27;s essentially imperceptible (\\&quot;unscented\\&quot; is printed on the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor - ditch the fruity, scented, cheap soap and treat your skin with care. Go Dove or go home! Also, the [[ASIN:B001GBF0A2 sensitive skin bars]] are worth considering since bars allegedly last longer than body wash. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, though.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> The soap smells fine, does it&#x27;s job of getting the dirt off of us, and most importantly is one of the only soaps that doesn&#x27;t irritate my son&#x27;s or my skin.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected and what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I am shocked at what a fantastic deal this actually is. These bottles are huge and there&#x27;s enough for each person in my house to have one all to themselves. Even taking a shower each night we won&#x27;t go through one bottle in a month. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this soap so much because my skin is so dry.  It really relieves my dryness.</li>
    <li> Cannot beat the price with the subscribe and save feature.  Nothing better than having these show up at your door.</li>
    <li> I personally like Dove body wash better than Olay; it has a richer lather and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. It&#x27;s cheap through the Subscribe and save!</li>
    <li> Dove is the best body wash. I like the ones for sensitive skin best for the NE winters. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. I wish it smelt more stronger on the skin but then that would mean more chemicals. So I like it as it were.</li>
    <li> I love and use all of the Dove Sensitive skin products. I swear on this body wash, it makes my skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Been using Dove since a child and it has always done wonders for my skin. I will forever buy Dove and the price is great and fast delivery</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap. It smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out so that&#x27;s good. It works well for shaving too.</li>
    <li> Dove sensitive skin booby wash as moisture and leave your skin feeling clean rinse. It also as a rich creamy lather.  My teen daugther use the product first and Just loves  it.  She say try it mom, you will love this product. I have try skin and it work for me. Thanks  Amazon</li>
    <li> These are not moisturizing like the regular kind. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and will stick with the regular kind next time.</li>
    <li> THEE best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I have VERY sensitive skin and everything else I&#x27;ve used caused irritation, this doesn&#x27;t and is my savior.</li>
    <li> This body wash is just okay. I bought the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; because that&#x27;s all they had in stock, but the scent is actually pretty strong, and I&#x27;m not even sensitive to scents. It smells like soap and sort of powdery lotion. Meh. Also the soap comes out in very hard globs - the type that are prone to bouncing off the loofa puff and onto the shower floor, and then getting swept away still in blob form until getting caught on the drain cover. The lather isn&#x27;t very long lasting, and I notice that after my shower there are still \\&quot;pieces\\&quot; of the soap stuck in the netting of my puff - it&#x27;s like it doesn&#x27;t really dissolve at all.  As far as cleaning my body I suppose it does just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As everyone else has said, the design of the bottle is ridiculously bad. It&#x27;s made of really hard plastic so it&#x27;s hard to squeeze, and the soap is so heavy that it clings to the inside of the bottle and won&#x27;t come out. The top of the bottle is pointy so it&#x27;s hard to store it upside down (I&#x27;ve been wedging it upside down in a cup) and even when that works, the soap sort of creates air tunnels in the bottle so although you can feel that there&#x27;s still a lot of soap left, it won&#x27;t come out. Super frustrating, and not really worth all that maneuvering for mediocre soap.</li>
