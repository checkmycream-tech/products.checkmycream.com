      <li>Pleased with protective sealed wrap</li>

      <li>old, but have not had crepeiness on my neck, nor do I have the lines that are like those on a tree when it is cut and one sees all the rings.  </li>
      <li>No other company be it Macys or Ulta etc.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much at all - about the size of a pea each time, so it is lasting a long time.  </li>
      <li>I think there are other products out there that work very well.  </li>

    <li> I have used this product and it is now almost gone.  I also have another neck/decollectage that works much better.  I am 68 yrs. old, but have not had crepeiness on my neck, nor do I have the lines that are like those on a tree when it is cut and one sees all the rings.  I think there are other products out there that work very well.  One that I can think of right off the top of my head is Argan Oil.  It is an oil, but it is absorbed into the skin and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Good product. Excellent service!</li>
    <li> Pleased with protective sealed wrap</li>
    <li> I order this monthly. Love it.</li>
    <li> I received the item quickly, and it was fresh and packaged securely.  After using it twice a day for three months, I do think the crepiness on my neck and chest has been reduced.  I don&#x27;t have to use much at all - about the size of a pea each time, so it is lasting a long time.  I probably have another three months-worth left in the tube.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> My neck looks better using the Firming creme than without it.&lt;br /&gt;Like that it absorbs into the skin quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 tubes of this neck cream and 2 for my mom. We both really like this cream. It works great!</li>
    <li> Was disappointed as I thought it was a cream to apply and leave on, when I got the cream it was a exfoliant to be used and rinsed off, very misleading to me , the consumer.  I would like to have a refund.</li>
    <li> Great price and smells great and I have seen a slight improvement in my neck area but I also drink a lot of water and work out and eat clean which has a lot to do with good health and skin so with this product and a healthy life style they work great together.</li>
    <li> Still to be determine what this product will do for me, but so far so good seem to make a firming affect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  While it will not make your neck tight as a 20 year old, it diminishes the wrinkles and improves the appearance 50%.  I love the smell and after the first application is absorbed, I reapply a second.  Best neck firming that I have found and believe me I&#x27;ve used them all!</li>
    <li> Great product and Amazon has the best pricing I&#x27;ve found. Try it once and you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell of the product, I only opened it, and could not stand the scent. So I asked the company Beautyconnectionone I bought it from via Amazon to return me me my money. I was told since I OPENED it they cannot take the product back. I did not use it. No other company be it Macys or Ulta etc. have such a unfair policies. I definitely will never buy anything from this company, which forces me to keep product i do not want to. I unscrew the top, to smell it...and only this is &amp;#34;reason&amp;#34; for them to force me to lose my money on product i cannot use. I am allergic to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;SO I am not happy customer, very frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;Please, do hesitate to buy anything from Beutyconnectionone. They will not return the products you purchased.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Glad I decided to give it a try.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product...highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I am throwing it away because I don&#x27;t prefer the medicine smell to it. I will not know how the creme works because it is not worth the smell.</li>
    <li> Works Great , Wrinkles Vanished ! Started making me look much younger , &amp; youthful to people :)It is a wonderful product , I highly reccomend it to anyone , men or women !</li>
    <li> watch the lines go away and smooth the next, Its great</li>
    <li> I was told that this product didn&#x27;t live up to the reputation.  This was from the person who I purchased it for!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  I have noticed an improvement since I use this every day.  I will be sure to reorder!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that some contents were made overseas, but not listed where?</li>
