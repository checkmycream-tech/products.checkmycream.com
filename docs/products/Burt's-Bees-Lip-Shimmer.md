### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, Way to go!!!      </li>
      <li>great!</li>
      <li>...are great!</li>
      <li>and it looks great!</li>
      <li>This product is great!  </li>
      <li>I especially love the peppermint-type flavor and the tingle you feel when you put it on.</li>
      <li>Perfect coverage in the winter and a great sunscreen coverage when we&#x27;re at the pool all day in the summer.  </li>
      <li>It feels so good because of the peppermint tingle!</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, if you know you like a shade, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>This product is great in that it definitley relives dryness.</li>
      <li>The tingle and moisture are great.  </li>
      <li>Nutmeg is great on darker skin, watermelon is great on blondes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>It feels great, looks great, and comes in many great colors.</li>
      <li>&quot; It smells good and has a good consistency.</li>
      <li>I have the raisin shade (I am fair w/blonde hair/blue eyes)</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer!  </li>
      <li>As others have shared, there is a great feeling when you put it on, kind of tingly and a nice, refreshing mint fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>It has a nice shimmer that doesn&#x27;t look like a neon sign on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>dab it on my cheeks, lips and the crease in my eyelids to perk up my whole face with a touch of color, PLUS the pepermint oil provides a wonderful tingle that wakes up my face in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I ended up giving that one to my mom, who liked it.  </li>
      <li>I liked the price and how my lips felt after using this, but the colors were so bright/dark</li>
      <li>I do kinda like how the color kind of stains your lips though.</li>
      <li>and it is the perfect compliment to my natural coloring.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product may not plump your lips like DuWop&#x27;s Lip Vemon, but it has a great color, great feeling (the tingle that you feel with this product doesn&#x27;t hurt like Lip Venom&#x27;s), and it&#x27;s a fourth of the price of Lip Venom!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product and wonderful if you don&#x27;t like heavy makeup.</li>
      <li>How great to have good color, not to bright, not too deep, just the right shade AND it super mousturizes too!!!</li>
      <li>I love their easy application, shimmer and peppermint flavor!  </li>
      <li>I have the coffee shimmer and love the way it looks on me, I have a darker skin tone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say that the medium colors (watermelon, rhubarb, and nutmeg) are the most agreeable to everyone.  </li>
      <li>it looks more like a lipstick than a \\&quot;lip shimmer.\\</li>
      <li>I love this lip shimmer from Burt&#x27;s Bees and I plan to get more colors.  </li>
      <li>It is an even lip color, more like a toned-down lipstick than a lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>One reviewer suggested you may be able to test at whole food stores, which could be a great option.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and there aren&#x27;t any that I dislike, though my favorite way to wear the darkest and lightest shades is to mix them together.  </li>
      <li>LOVE BURTS BEES</li>
      <li>It makes my lips soft and has that great peppermint tingle.</li>
      <li>It tingles when you apply it due to the peppermint ingredient, and it smells great!  </li>
      <li>The tingle is not as intense as the original lip balm but still quite pleasant and kissable, not goopy.  </li>
      <li>if I want something that strong, I want lipstick.</li>
      <li>I happened to buy one I liked on the first try.</li>
      <li>It is also VERY shimmery, so to me it had more of a youthful touch to it, which can be a turn off to someone looking for something more sophisticated.</li>
      <li>The applicator is the right size, the price is right, and these make my lips feel good.  </li>
      <li>The one I was able to test was a very rich brown, which is surprising for a lip-balm type product, as the colors are typically very sheer.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t like having to worry about making precise dabs when I&#x27;m not around a mirror.</li>
      <li>This is such a great product.</li>
      <li>24/7, well, everyone really should, and this gives me nice color when I want it.</li>
      <li>It goes on evenly and starts soothing as soon as soon as I put it on, and the tingly peppermint provides a nice bit of aromatherapy for the whole time I&#x27;m wearing it.  </li>
      <li>And, they are natural so you can feel good about what you are putting on your lips instead of chemical, dye and perfume-laden lipsticks and gloss</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the other colors are great</li>
      <li>I first used the strawberry lip gloss and loved it so much, I had to try the shimmer.</li>
      <li>The guava and champagne have significantly more shimmer (almost to the point of \\&quot;glittery\\&quot;) but look amazing when mixed with the darkest colors.  </li>
      <li>I have fair skin and very dark hair and both seem to look pretty good on me.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like heavy lipstick, but want some color on your lips, the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer is just great.</li>
      <li>I have Rhubarb and it is a nice sheer shade that compliments my skin</li>
      <li>It brings a sweet tingle to my lips and the minty fragrance feels fresh and crisp.  </li>
      <li>They are all great colors but Coffee and Champange are more casual colors whereas Merlot and Raisin are more intense colors.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees does make excellent products, and I was very disapointed to not love this one as much as the others I have tried.</li>
      <li>and I have freckles and a tan going right now.  </li>
      <li>It is slightly deeper than a bright fuschia, once applied.</li>
      <li>The trick to too much color is to apply the shimmer on top of (Burt&#x27;s Bees) clear lip gloss.</li>
      <li>it was far more intense -</li>
      <li>but my first time out of the gate is with the Champagne color.  </li>
      <li>Because, at that point, the color is soft and light like I had hoped it would be in the begining.</li>
      <li>I am going back for more colors.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve bought Nutmeg again after losing my first stick.</li>
      <li>My stick of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer, in Nutmeg, is just what I want: it moisturizes and feels as great on as the regular BB lip balm, and it adds color to my lip without looking too bold for my everyday use or requiring a mirror to apply.</li>
      <li>I have to start off by saying the one color that I tried is not available here (guava) which is probably a good thing because it ended up being a very frosty, almost lilac color.  </li>
      <li>The peppermint oil adds a nice little tingle.</li>
      <li>After application, it has a very cooling peppermint feel to it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I have to dab the colors on to not get too much and</li>
      <li>but they are really as salient as lipsticks.</li>
      <li>Watermelon is a shimmery pink that will look better on me in the summer, when my skin has a tan.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend everyone going to a place with testers (try whole foods) before buying a color.  </li>
      <li>The \\&quot;zing\\&quot; does last for awhile and while I enjoy it, others may not</li>
      <li>Coffee is a deep, rich color.  </li>
      <li>After hearing all the great reviews about Burt&#x27;s Bees and their \\&quot;fantastic\\&quot; lip balm, I was curious enough to buy several of their products to try.</li>
      <li>At first i bought the color Cocoa, but it was too dark, so I gave that one to my mom and got Toffe, a lighter, more natural shade of brown.</li>
      <li>I think for a color this vibrant, you might as well just stick with lipstick and skip the Lip Shine altogether.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a decent way to touch up color if your normal stuff wears off, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a natural, gentle lip balm with just the right amount of color: while it&#x27;s not look-at-me-I&#x27;m-wearing-lipstick, the soft shades complement my natural tones.</li>
      <li>BUT, if I wanna, I can add this on top of my night time dark dark rich color</li>
      <li>But at this price, I don&#x27;t want to risk buying tubes to try new colors.</li>
      <li>i live in SO Cal and ride a motorcycle,</li>
      <li>The rhubarb is more pink than red (the cap looks reddish).</li>
      <li>I have tried a wide variety of brands and prices of lip products and this one is right up there!  </li>
      <li>This is like a lipstick because it has such intense color!</li>
      <li>I love this product and plan to try other Burts Bess products too, such as their lip gloss.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t write this product off, and I might even be tempted to try it again, but I would definitely want to test out the colors first.  </li>
      <li>I wish the color really was sheer as I&#x27;m not a lipstick kinda girl</li>
      <li>Also if you want a color that will shimmer, but isn&#x27;t too show-offish, then you should get Champagne, a soft, shimmery color.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s more expensive than a lot of lip balms, I think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>I was recently turned on to this Shimmer Lip Balm and I can&#x27;t live without it now.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Things I did not like about the product: While it seemed to glide on smoothly, upon further inspection, I noticed that the Rhubarb color tended to settle a bit too heavily into the lip creases.</li>
      <li>and/or how shimmery they are, and it&#x27;s hard to predict the accurate color from the packaging.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I think a problem is that the shades vary widely in how intense</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> WOW!  I love this product.  I have the raisin shade (I am fair w/blonde hair/blue eyes) and it is the perfect compliment to my natural coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dab it on my cheeks, lips and the crease in my eyelids to perk up my whole face with a touch of color, PLUS the pepermint oil provides a wonderful tingle that wakes up my face in the morning.  I am afraid it is next to \\&quot;coffee\\&quot; as one of my morning requirements now.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like heavy lipstick, but want some color on your lips, the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer is just great. The shades are sheer but well-chosen for any complexion. Nutmeg is great on darker skin, watermelon is great on blondes. The color is sheer and the formula is soothing to the lips with a bit of minty tingle. It&#x27;s a great product and wonderful if you don&#x27;t like heavy makeup.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer!  I have Rhubarb and it is a nice sheer shade that compliments my skin well and it isn&#x27;t sticky like lip gloss can be.  The peppermint oil adds a nice little tingle.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  I have the rhubarb color, and it is soothing like Blistex.  It tingles when you apply it due to the peppermint ingredient, and it smells great!  It is an even lip color, more like a toned-down lipstick than a lip gloss.  It makes my lips feel rejuvenated and hydrated.  I love this lip shimmer from Burt&#x27;s Bees and I plan to get more colors.  The rhubarb is more pink than red (the cap looks reddish).</li>
    <li> I worked at a store that sold these by the counter, and everyone seems to go for the lighter colors, which I think is a mistake.  I would recommend everyone going to a place with testers (try whole foods) before buying a color.  I&#x27;ve tried them all and there aren&#x27;t any that I dislike, though my favorite way to wear the darkest and lightest shades is to mix them together.  The guava and champagne have significantly more shimmer (almost to the point of \\&quot;glittery\\&quot;) but look amazing when mixed with the darkest colors.  I&#x27;d say that the medium colors (watermelon, rhubarb, and nutmeg) are the most agreeable to everyone.  The tingle is not as intense as the original lip balm but still quite pleasant and kissable, not goopy.  I love the size of the tube because I can slip it into my pocket without making my leg terribly lumpy.  I always have at least one shade in my purse or pocket, and it is the first lip product I reach for.</li>
    <li> At work we all tried this color on and it looks smashing on each and every one of us (6). \\&quot;Offer not valid\\&quot; on all of Bert&#x27;s Lip Shimmer colors.</li>
    <li> This is like a lipstick because it has such intense color! It feels so good because of the peppermint tingle! I highly recommend this! The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the tube gets messy where the cap sits. I have tried coffee and watermelon. I have fair skin and very dark hair and both seem to look pretty good on me.</li>
    <li> This product is great in that it definitley relives dryness. And I like the variety of shades that you get with this package. However, this is supposed to be sheer color but they are really as salient as lipsticks. I have to dab the colors on to not get too much and even then I use the champagne color to subdue it. I wish the color really was sheer as I&#x27;m not a lipstick kinda girl and I don&#x27;t like having to worry about making precise dabs when I&#x27;m not around a mirror. I mean, it&#x27;s supposed to be lip gloss for pete&#x27;s sake!! I do kinda like how the color kind of stains your lips though. Because, at that point, the color is soft and light like I had hoped it would be in the begining. Oh well, I&#x27;ll use them and just adapt.</li>
    <li> My stick of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer, in Nutmeg, is just what I want: it moisturizes and feels as great on as the regular BB lip balm, and it adds color to my lip without looking too bold for my everyday use or requiring a mirror to apply. It has subtle gold-toned shimmer. Although it&#x27;s more expensive than a lot of lip balms, I think it&#x27;s worth it and I&#x27;ve bought Nutmeg again after losing my first stick. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, I think a problem is that the shades vary widely in how intense and/or how shimmery they are, and it&#x27;s hard to predict the accurate color from the packaging. Other reviews seem to reflect this problem. I happened to buy one I liked on the first try. But when I tried another (Raisin, I think) it was far more intense - if I want something that strong, I want lipstick. I ended up giving that one to my mom, who liked it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, if you know you like a shade, it&#x27;s great. But at this price, I don&#x27;t want to risk buying tubes to try new colors. One reviewer suggested you may be able to test at whole food stores, which could be a great option.</li>
    <li> I have never used Burt Bees products before and just bought the cocoa shade.  I absolutely love it!  My hair and eyes are dark brown and I have freckles and a tan going right now.  I was not expecting the density of the color but also wear lipstick, so not a problem.  The tingle and moisture are great.  I have tried a wide variety of brands and prices of lip products and this one is right up there!  I am going back for more colors.</li>
    <li> I have to start off by saying the one color that I tried is not available here (guava) which is probably a good thing because it ended up being a very frosty, almost lilac color.  I cannot remember how long I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but they are fabulous, which is why I feel bad giving this such a low rating.  As others have shared, there is a great feeling when you put it on, kind of tingly and a nice, refreshing mint fragrance.  I wouldn&#x27;t write this product off, and I might even be tempted to try it again, but I would definitely want to test out the colors first.  The one I was able to test was a very rich brown, which is surprising for a lip-balm type product, as the colors are typically very sheer.  It is also VERY shimmery, so to me it had more of a youthful touch to it, which can be a turn off to someone looking for something more sophisticated. Burt&#x27;s Bees does make excellent products, and I was very disapointed to not love this one as much as the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this product.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a natural, gentle lip balm with just the right amount of color: while it&#x27;s not look-at-me-I&#x27;m-wearing-lipstick, the soft shades complement my natural tones. It goes on evenly and starts soothing as soon as soon as I put it on, and the tingly peppermint provides a nice bit of aromatherapy for the whole time I&#x27;m wearing it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product. I almost always have small tube of it tucked into my pocket or backpack.</li>
    <li> After hearing all the great reviews about Burt&#x27;s Bees and their \\&quot;fantastic\\&quot; lip balm, I was curious enough to buy several of their products to try. I purchased three of the lip shimmers, one in Rhubarb, Champagne, and Nutmeg.  I am only going to review the Rhubarb here, as I have not tried the Champagne or the Nutmeg yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the Rhubarb color is a little intense. It is slightly deeper than a bright fuschia, once applied. This does not stop it from being a pleasing color, it is just a bit brighter than I anticipated (from looking at the color of the packaging).  After application, it has a very cooling peppermint feel to it. The feeling reminded me of the \\&quot;Softlips\\&quot; brand. The \\&quot;zing\\&quot; does last for awhile and while I enjoy it, others may not (It&#x27;s like forgetting to wipe Listerine off of your lips). I also like the fact that the lip shimmers are sheer and 100% natural. It has some mica in it to give it a pleasingly soft (almost imperceptible) shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I did not like about the product: While it seemed to glide on smoothly, upon further inspection, I noticed that the Rhubarb color tended to settle a bit too heavily into the lip creases. It also accented dry patches all over my lips that I didn&#x27;t know I had - I applied my regular lipstick (Lancome Rouge Sensation/Dior Addict Lipstick) to one half and Lip Shine to the other half and inspected it. With the Lip Shine, I got patchiness. On the lipstick side, no patches. I have never seen \\&quot;patchiness\\&quot; like this.  I think for a color this vibrant, you might as well just stick with lipstick and skip the Lip Shine altogether.  But I&#x27;ve got three entire sticks to get through now, so I guess it&#x27;s going in the purse &#x27;till it&#x27;s done or I lose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict? It&#x27;s a decent way to touch up color if your normal stuff wears off, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. I think I&#x27;ll try a different brand of lip balm/lip shine, such as Shea Terra Organics or Beesworks next time.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. It feels great, looks great, and comes in many great colors. It&#x27;s just...great! I especially love the peppermint-type flavor and the tingle you feel when you put it on. At first i bought the color Cocoa, but it was too dark, so I gave that one to my mom and got Toffe, a lighter, more natural shade of brown. Also if you want a color that will shimmer, but isn&#x27;t too show-offish, then you should get Champagne, a soft, shimmery color. I love this product and plan to try other Burts Bess products too, such as their lip gloss. Coclusion: This product may not plump your lips like DuWop&#x27;s Lip Vemon, but it has a great color, great feeling (the tingle that you feel with this product doesn&#x27;t hurt like Lip Venom&#x27;s), and it&#x27;s a fourth of the price of Lip Venom! So go get a Burts Bess Lip Shimmer lip balm!</li>
    <li> I have these in Nutmeg, Watermelon and Coffee.  Nutmeg is my everyday color.  I have pale skin and dark brown hair.  Watermelon is a shimmery pink that will look better on me in the summer, when my skin has a tan.  Coffee is a deep, rich color.  I love their easy application, shimmer and peppermint flavor!  The applicator is the right size, the price is right, and these make my lips feel good.  I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying all the time.  And, they are natural so you can feel good about what you are putting on your lips instead of chemical, dye and perfume-laden lipsticks and gloss (and yes, you are ingesting what you put on your lips).  I want to collect all the colors eventually.</li>
    <li> I liked the price and how my lips felt after using this, but the colors were so bright/dark that I never wore it out of the house.</li>
    <li> I was recently turned on to this Shimmer Lip Balm and I can&#x27;t live without it now.  It brings a sweet tingle to my lips and the minty fragrance feels fresh and crisp.  I&#x27;m sure the other colors are great but my first time out of the gate is with the Champagne color.  It has a nice shimmer that doesn&#x27;t look like a neon sign on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products - the lip balms are dreamy.  Perfect coverage in the winter and a great sunscreen coverage when we&#x27;re at the pool all day in the summer.  My kids don&#x27;t leave the house without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this shimmer lip balm a try - you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I first used the strawberry lip gloss and loved it so much, I had to try the shimmer. I have the coffee shimmer and love the way it looks on me, I have a darker skin tone. It makes my lips soft and has that great peppermint tingle. I have since tried Merlot, Champange and Raisin. They are all great colors but Coffee and Champange are more casual colors whereas Merlot and Raisin are more intense colors. The trick to too much color is to apply the shimmer on top of (Burt&#x27;s Bees) clear lip gloss. It&#x27;s great, Way to go!!!      As for the Carmine, it&#x27;s also in food we eat which has artificial flavours and coloring...</li>
    <li> ...are great! I use them all. How great to have good color, not to bright, not too deep, just the right shade AND it super mousturizes too!!! i live in SO Cal and ride a motorcycle, si I have to keep my lips covered 24/7, well, everyone really should, and this gives me nice color when I want it.I don&#x27;t like really dark dark heavy heavy coloras,this is just right for me. BUT, if I wanna, I can add this on top of my night time dark dark rich color and it looks great! LOVE BURTS BEES</li>
    <li> This is allright- it looks more like a lipstick than a \\&quot;lip shimmer.\\&quot; It smells good and has a good consistency.</li>
