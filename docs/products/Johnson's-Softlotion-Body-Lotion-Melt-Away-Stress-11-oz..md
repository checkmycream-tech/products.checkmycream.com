      <li>Friends come over and slather themselves in it too :)</li>
      <li>Love it and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around here!&lt;br</li>
      <li>so thanks the price seems fair</li>
      <li>I love this lotion and was really excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The scent is not too strong; yet, it as described, it has a calming effect...</li>
      <li>I am happy with this purchase and product and will definitely buy this again.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and soothing.  </li>
      <li>She loves the smell as well as the creamy, light texture</li>
      <li>just this one has the lavander fragrance but it just leaves my skin smooth all day.</li>
      <li>Amazon offers the two pack which I think is a good value.</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>Smells fabulous, soft, like a warm blanket.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite lotion.  </li>
      <li>Good lotion, but wish the bottle was bigger for the price.</li>
      <li>WORK ON TENSE MUSCLES BUT GREAT FOR STRESS!</li>
      <li>i stock up every 4 to 5 months in a bulk load to make sure i dont run out its good stuff na a waste of money at all &amp;lt;33333</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy, but moisturizes the skin beautifully.  </li>
      <li>It is my new favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly why I purchased it...to settle me down around bed time, but I am finding myself using it more and more throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>little higher then paid before, but nice to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is the most amazing lotion with a subtle scent that truly soothes.  </li>
      <li>so I tried Amazon and sure enough</li>
      <li>Absorbs very nicely without being greasy and is long lasting.</li>
      <li>its the only stuff that actually smelt sooo good and really did make me wanna fall asleep</li>
      <li>i go thru so much of it.</li>
      <li>it is so soft and velvety and just makes me feel so calm and relaxed for the evening.</li>
      <li>but both bottles from the shipment contained a &amp;#34;Grit&amp;#34; within the lotion which was very displeasing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>She fell in love with it and looked high and low to find it in stores in New York and Maryland, AND I looked for it here in Los Angeles.  </li>
      <li>The aroma lasts for most of the day on me and will also seep into your clothing, which can be good or bad.  </li>
      <li>I want the old Johnson baby lotion!</li>
      <li>this is not the exact one I was looking for but similar</li>
      <li>It is priced right and much cheaper than the bigger aromatherapy products that offer the same advantages.  </li>
      <li>I generally can find weird, semi-obscure things on Amazon and that makes me happy.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully, J &amp; J will change their mind &amp; bring back the whole line.  </li>
      <li>My hands &amp; body feel so soft when I use it.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin soft, as well.</li>
      <li>This is not typical for this product.</li>
      <li>other posters have stated, there is no oily feeling to this lotion and the scent seems to last awhile, making it feel like I am getting my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>

<li> I think  $21.97 is a little to high for a 11oz bottle.</li>
<li> Whenever I pumped out lotion, little white beads/sand looking stuff came out with the lotion, making it feel gross!</li>
<li> but it feels gritty and there are little white grains in it.</li>
<li> You can usually buy this at some big drugstores or big box stores but sometimes they are out for a long time.  </li>
<li> I would prefer buying the small bottles over this gritty lotion.</li>
<li> but I had to stop using it due to the grit.  </li>
<li> its not greasy like alot of other lotions you get</li>
<li> Now we all know where to get it next time because it is apparently VERY HARD TO FIND.  </li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few years and this shipment was not up to par.  </li>
<li> I use it everyday!  </li>
<li> Girlfriend searched for this everywhere after she had a small travel sized one.</li>
<li> Not sure what it was exposed to</li>
<li> She was frustrated because she came up completely empty-handed</li>
<li> So pre baby I was sad that this was discontinued</li>
<li> and unfortunately so did I.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it has been discontinued.  </li>
<li> I hate that I don&#x27;t see it in stores anymore</li>
<li> Judging by the outrageous price on Amazon, I think it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>

    <li> My niece smelled this when a roommate of hers was using some.  She fell in love with it and looked high and low to find it in stores in New York and Maryland, AND I looked for it here in Los Angeles.  She was frustrated because she came up completely empty-handed and unfortunately so did I.  It was on her &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; list so I tried Amazon and sure enough, I found it through Johnson and Johnson.  She loves the smell as well as the creamy, light texture and she is so glad I found it for her!  I generally can find weird, semi-obscure things on Amazon and that makes me happy.  Now we all know where to get it next time because it is apparently VERY HARD TO FIND.  Excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and feels great on your skin. Long-lasting fragrance and softness. Glad to find it here. I can never find it in stores.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend searched for this everywhere after she had a small travel sized one. Smells good.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It smells wonderful and clean.  I use it everyday!  Friends come over and slather themselves in it too :)</li>

    <li> This is my absolute favorite lotion.  It smell heavenly!  I used to buy purse size at my local target for one dollar but now can&#x27;t find it anywhere in any size.. Judging by the outrageous price on Amazon, I think it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
    <li> This lotion melts into your skin.  My hands &amp; body feel so soft when I use it.  The smell......so wonderful.  I cannot describe how amazing this lotion is.  Unfortunately, it has been discontinued.  I&#x27;m not sure why buy I&#x27;m very upset!  I purchased 4 bottles recently but I know it&#x27;s not enough.  Hopefully, J &amp; J will change their mind &amp; bring back the whole line.  Fingers Crossed!!!</li>
    <li> Love it and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around here!&lt;br /&gt;A little higher then paid before, but nice to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is yet another product that disappeared from local stores.  The fragrance is light and soothing.  Absorbs very nicely without being greasy and is long lasting.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found this on Amazon. It&#x27;s a great lotion and I use it every night. It smells heavenly and leaves the skin feelin non-greasy. Keeps my skin soft, as well.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion of all time in Hawaii on Oahu it can&#x27;t be found no where now so I had ro pay big to get this.</li>
    <li> Good lotion, but wish the bottle was bigger for the price. I think  $21.97 is a little to high for a 11oz bottle. It was a Christmas present for someone, but I will not get it again.</li>
    <li> So pre baby I was sad that this was discontinued, then after someone got me the Nighttime baby lotion set for my son I realized its THE SAME THING, just in a different package...and 1/4 of the price of buying the &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; version on line.  Just an FYI ladies who love this scent like I do.  Now I just share with the baby.  : )  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body lotion which I can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore..so thanks the price seems fair and I hope you continue to carry it..</li>

    <li> I love this lotion and was really excited to find it on Amazon. It smells the same but it feels gritty and there are little white grains in it. Although they disappear, it doesn&#x27;t feel good on my skin. I would prefer buying the small bottles over this gritty lotion.</li>
    <li> I hate that I don&#x27;t see it in stores anymore like I used to but I love this lotion. When I wear this lotion, guys would inhale the lotion when hugging me. I love it and so do they!</li>
    <li> AS SOON AS I RUB WITH IT I FEEL INSTANT RELIEF!&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T WORK ON TENSE MUSCLES BUT GREAT FOR STRESS!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Smells fabulous, soft, like a warm blanket. I use this after I shower and before bedtime. I bought myself two more bottles!</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I cant seem to find this in stores anywhere. the fragrance is heavenly. I even had someone ask me what I was wearing because she used to work in perfume industry and knows quality scents! It is a MILD pleasant lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion so relaxing and feel of this lotion its not greasy like alot of other lotions you get</li>
