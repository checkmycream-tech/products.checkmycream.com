      <li>So glad we can purchase it from you.</li>
      <li>This cologne is my husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>This is my husband favorite.  </li>
      <li>and I LOVE IT,&lt;br</li>
      <li>They should be able to trade on the reputation of this product for another year or so, until all of the faithful users get stung.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it, he loves it.  </li>
      <li>Being able to purchase it on line has made this easier.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Royall Muske for many years now</li>
      <li>I love the fragrances on him.</li>
      <li>It should be worn with care not to overdue and irritate others as all perfumes are allergens to many asthmatics.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it, he loves it.</li>
      <li>I love a musk scent on a man, but not just any musk scent.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Refreshing clean smell and seems to be liked by all that I come in contact with from spouse to the Starbuck&#x27;s barista.</li>
      <li>Compared to most men&#x27;s fragrances of today, \\&quot;Royal Muske\\&quot; does not have the overpowering strong citrus/spicy smell.</li>
      <li>Many times while walking through the halls of my place of employment, I would often have women coworkers ask me to walk closer to them because of the most unique fragrance.</li>
      <li>I had to stop wearing this because beautiful women wouldn&#x27;t stop following me around and trying to &amp;#34;hug&amp;#34; me.  </li>
      <li>I refill the bottle, I often get a little on me - and it&#x27;s smells so delicious</li>
      <li>Royal Muske is a fantastic aftershave.</li>
      <li>Everyone appears to enjoy the scent.  </li>
      <li>Imagine smelling like Don Draper (without the cigarette smoke, booze and cheap floozies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the bit extra to get this great product from Bermuda.</li>
      <li>I bought it years ago and now find it&#x27;s more than worth</li>
      <li>No aroma, no tingle, just a $32.00 bottle of cheap, much-diluted alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great every day scent, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>The purchase price was very fair and beat other sources.</li>
      <li>Always be sure to get the genuine product -- evidently there may be some fakes out there.</li>
      <li>The scent is wonderful; not overwhelming, but rich.  </li>
      <li>It is bracingly musk, but light, without any sweet tones.  </li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>It also wears off incredibly quickly--usually within half an hour (1 hour max).  </li>
      <li>really did not mind it, but I also was not as impressed as other reviewers were.  </li>
      <li>Musk can be overpowering or cloying or too sweet.  </li>
      <li>It is very noticeable, especially at first opening the bottle.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if a smaller sample were available for purchase.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is not over powering&lt;br /&gt;but smells good for a long time.  </li>
      <li>Presumably the company’s owners just learned that a fast and easy way to increase profits is to cheapen the product.</li>
      <li>We first bought it on our honeymoon in Bermuda over 32 years ago!</li>
      <li>It was a terrific simple musk fragrance and per ounce a very good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
      <li>This cologne does not have a powerful scent.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t allow the negative reviews about the experiences with the product to deter you from experiencing one of the world&#x27;s most wonderful male colognes.</li>
      <li>This is the cologne that my dad&#x27;s barbershop would slap on my neck after a haircut as a kid; he&#x27;d smile and I&#x27;d feel all grown up.  </li>
      <li>Buying it through Amazon is by the far the most economical way of buying Royalle Muske.</li>
      <li>also has other women ask what he is wearing and how good he smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And anyone who isn&#x27;t familiar with the older formulation won&#x27;t miss a thing.</li>
      <li>I tried really hard to made sure that was the kind I was getting.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who wants to get lucky.  </li>
      <li>enjoy the light fragrance and lasting qualities.</li>
      <li>Brooks brothers sells smaller bottle for more.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Royall Lyme&amp;#34; was their first fragrance.</li>
      <li>First thoughts: I opened the box, and saw what looked to be an oversized juicebox.</li>
      <li>Today&#x27;s product gave me the impression of a higher alcohol content (I have the vintage version as well).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years since my first visit to Bermuda over 15 years ago.</li>
      <li>A little to strong of a fragrance...slightly overwhelming.</li>

    <li> Only after shave my husband will use.  I love it, he loves it.</li>
    <li> A little to strong of a fragrance...slightly overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best muske&#x27;s around and such a good deal.  I recommend it. Nice glass container and wrapping.</li>
    <li> It makes a great gift for my Husband. The fragrance he likes and I LOVE IT,&lt;br /&gt;he also has other women ask what he is wearing and how good he smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as a gift for someone special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be pleased.............</li>
    <li> I am a young(er) guy (31) and I love wearing this.  It makes me feel like I am honoring what real men we had from the greatest generation.  My wife likes it also, but yeah, it does smell like an old guy...but I like that, so yeah...</li>
    <li> I bought this because my girlfriend encouraged me to. She saw it in a store and liked the smell. Other women have noticed it and made favorable comments about it.</li>
    <li> Royall of Bermuda has one of the most perfect musk scents on the planet!  I really enjoy this as well as some of their other scents and I won&#x27;t be without it!  It&#x27;s always nice to find it on Amazon.com and find it at a good price with quick shipping!</li>
    <li> My hubby uses this cologne regularly, so I replaced his almost empty Royall Muske for Father&#x27;s Day.  Folks always tell him how good he smells, and I think so too.  In comparison shopping, the price was also reasonable.</li>
    <li> It is such a shame that many reviewers have had a negative experience with this cologne. There must be something wrong--either they are receiving a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; version of this product or a bad batch.  I have been using this cologne for years. I have never had a bad comment about the frgrance. I have had nothing but good comments. Many times while walking through the halls of my place of employment, I would often have women coworkers ask me to walk closer to them because of the most unique fragrance. The fragrance is not overpowering. It is rather subdued but distinct and unforgettable. The distinctive embossed bottle with the real lead crown top is actually a collector&#x27;s item and I sold quite a number of the empty bottles at a local flea market. Compared to most men&#x27;s fragrances of today, \\&quot;Royal Muske\\&quot; does not have the overpowering strong citrus/spicy smell. \\&quot;Royal Muske\\&quot; is a mellow - aged, subdued and masculine scent that will forever be remembered, especially by your female friends. Women especially like the scent -- not for themselves but for their male friends and relatives. If you have never experienced this fragrance, you should try a sample. This is a most wonderful fragrance for most males. Always be sure that you apply it and then wait about a half hour or so to allow the unique fragrance to interact with with your own body&#x27;s natural scent to produce the aroma which is uniquely different for each person. Don&#x27;t allow the negative reviews about the experiences with the product to deter you from experiencing one of the world&#x27;s most wonderful male colognes. Always be sure to get the genuine product -- evidently there may be some fakes out there.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I thought it was the muske made in Bermuda.....   THAT WAS NOT THE CASE!!!!   The product that was sent is a cheap imitation made somewhere  I don&#x27;t know where...  It is very weak, not even having a scent of the muske I last bought in Bermuda.  Even the label has misspellings within it...  I would not order this product again, and will throw out what I did buy, and kiss off the money it cost me.  I am not sure I would order thru e-bay again after this experience..</li>
    <li> This cologne does not have a powerful scent. It&#x27;s like a soft musk. If you smell it directly from the bottle, you may not like it at first. But after it is put on, it compliments the body&#x27;s natural scent and smells much softer. I brought this for a friend of mine and he loves it! In my opinion, I think it smelled great on him and the scent was kind of destracting(in a good way ;-) )&lt;br /&gt;The packaging looks just like the picture. Delivery took about 3 days.</li>
    <li> Like this. Using it now.</li>
    <li> This is the cologne that my dad&#x27;s barbershop would slap on my neck after a haircut as a kid; he&#x27;d smile and I&#x27;d feel all grown up.  Later on, it became the only cologne I use, and especially after a barbershop haircut.  One woman actually followed me around a store, and made the same comment about the scent.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my father who loved it and was wondering how I found this difficult item to find.  Granted my father is older and doesn&#x27;t fully understand the capacity of the internet.</li>
    <li> This crap doesn&#x27;t smell like musk at all!</li>
    <li> I discovered this cologne on a vacation in Bermuda.  Great smell (my wife loves it) and the price here is the best I have been able to find.  Brooks brothers sells smaller bottle for more.</li>
    <li> ROYALL MUSKE OF BERMUDA IS THE FRAGRANCE OF HONEY &amp; SPICES, WARM, SENSUAL &amp; CALMING, FOR A MAN WITH A SOUL !!</li>
    <li> Sour and not appealing scent.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who wants to get lucky.  Go for Calvin Kleins Escape instead.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I love the way it smells.  It&#x27;s not assaulting on the senses.  My wife loves when I wear this stuff!</li>
    <li> First thoughts: I opened the box, and saw what looked to be an oversized juicebox. On the backside of the wrappings is a fun little throwback advertisement for the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First smell: After opening the bottle, I immediately thought, \\&quot;This is Old Spice!\\&quot; and I was a little disappointed. But then I applied it on the inside of my wrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it dried, I smelled my wrists. And I was blown away. The Old Spice smell stopped at the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Musk (Of course), Vanilla, some spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is an amazing cologne. Great every day scent, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> It smells like you just got out of a barber shop in 1960.  Imagine smelling like Don Draper (without the cigarette smoke, booze and cheap floozies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the smell is as loud as a ghetto Ethyl Merman, but subsides within an hour.  Between the time you put it on and the end of that hour, stay away from those you wish to make a good impression upon.  Imagine a high-end Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did not mind it, but I also was not as impressed as other reviewers were.  It would be nice if a smaller sample were available for purchase.  I will keep this and use it the days the Mrs. is on a trip, or when I wax philosophic about Eisenhower.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original. An American company is licensed to make it now, so I&#x27;m sure they are using inferior ingredients, and cheapening the product so the execs, as always, make a nice bonus, and when nobody buys it anymore, they&#x27;ll move on to some other company to acquire and destroy. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years since my first visit to Bermuda over 15 years ago. Buying it through Amazon is by the far the most economical way of buying Royalle Muske.</li>
    <li> Began using this in 1980, got lots of compliments then, and the fragrance lasted all day long. Something has changed, the quality of smell is no longer noticable. It&#x27;s just not the same, and will not buy again</li>
    <li> Refreshing clean smell and seems to be liked by all that I come in contact with from spouse to the Starbuck&#x27;s barista.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these Royall products and always has at least 3 going at one time so he can choose which one is good for the day. I love the fragrances on him.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!  Always makes me want to snuggle up to my husband.</li>
    <li> All Good Things Must End ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I opened my last bottle of Royall Muske this morning. At first I thought that it must be a knock-off, although the bottle came directly from Amazon. The contents were almost odorless. I shook the bottle; I kept splashing it on.  No aroma, no tingle, just a $32.00 bottle of cheap, much-diluted alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have used this product for about thirty years, searching it out in stores long before Amazon and the internet, when the Royall products were hard to find. Presumably the company’s owners just learned that a fast and easy way to increase profits is to cheapen the product. They should be able to trade on the reputation of this product for another year or so, until all of the faithful users get stung.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Amazon did not defraud me, and I won’t be sending this back. But I won’t fall for this trick twice, either. Regrettably, along with the Muske, I also purchased the 8 oz. bottles of Royall Spyce and Royall Lyme. I am all set to be disappointed again when these are opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Suggestions for a replacement to the old Royall Muske are appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sjbritt</li>
    <li> This is my husband favorite.  We purchased it in Jamaica.  So glad we can purchase it from you. The fragrance is not over powering&lt;br /&gt;but smells good for a long time.  I love it too.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite since we visited Bermuda a few moons  ago. Still part of wife and daughter spiff me up program</li>
    <li> I have worn this cologne for over 30 years.  It is unique, subtle, and does not overpower.  Still a fan after all these years!</li>
    <li> Awesome manly fragrance. Not chemically or fake ingredients.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Many good comments.</li>
    <li> The scent is wonderful; not overwhelming, but rich.  The musk is very evident but not too heavy and slightly sweet.  I use it everyday.  Buying it online from Amazon is 50% less expensive than buying in stores.</li>
    <li> In the late 1950&#x27;s, a yachtsman in Bermuda founded a fragrance company called Royall Lyme Bermuda.  &amp;#34;Royall Lyme&amp;#34; was their first fragrance. Later on &amp;#34;Royall Muske&amp;#34; was produced.  It was a terrific simple musk fragrance and per ounce a very good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to the beginning of the 21st century and The Clarecastle Group bought the licensing rights to Royall Lyme Bermuda fragrances. At the onset, they started to reformulate the fragrances. Part of this was due to circumstances outside their control, namely the IFRA. But they also attenuated the fragrance concentration. Today&#x27;s product gave me the impression of a higher alcohol content (I have the vintage version as well).  It is very noticeable, especially at first opening the bottle. But... the fragrance needs air exposure for some time.  The good thing is that in the dry down after application, the essential notes come through as the same balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I still prefer the vintage version for the stronger initial blast of musk, ultimately it is still a good fragrance. And anyone who isn&#x27;t familiar with the older formulation won&#x27;t miss a thing.</li>
    <li> This product was new to me and I purchased it based on the other very favorable ratings.  I was not disappointed.  It has a nice fragrance that is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite for a man&#x27;s cologne.  I bought it years ago and now find it&#x27;s more than worth the bit extra to get this great product from Bermuda.</li>
    <li> Since finding Royall Muske on a trip to the Virgin Islands way back in 1987, it&#x27;s the only after shave my husband uses. To me, it smells like him.  We actually put in in a little spray dispenser (the woman&#x27;s hair spray travel size sprayers) and he puts a spritz on every night after his shower.  We haven&#x27;t ever had a bad bottle. I always buy it at a local, family owned drug store, but thought I&#x27;d try and get it on Amazon for a change. Don&#x27;t hesitate! This is a wonderful man&#x27;s cologne!</li>
    <li> I love a musk scent on a man, but not just any musk scent.  Musk can be overpowering or cloying or too sweet.  I sampled quite a few variations and found nothing I really liked.  Then, on a trip to the Bahamas, I found this cologne.  Don&#x27;t ask my how a Bermudian cologne ended up in the Bahamas, but since trying it once, I&#x27;ve never bought anything else for my husband.  It is bracingly musk, but light, without any sweet tones.  The scent lasts about an hour, and I wish it would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually purchase a spray bottle and refill it from the large screw top bottle.  I also find it&#x27;s nice to purchase some of the sample sizes for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I refill the bottle, I often get a little on me - and it&#x27;s smells so delicious, I&#x27;m always tempted to replace my own perfume/cologne with this.  I resist, as I like the scent on my husband so much.</li>
    <li> The cologne is quit nice but I do prefer the Royall lime. It is nice so for a little change and did arrive very fast.</li>
    <li> We have been buying this for 30+ years.  Great price and performance.  Not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This Cologne is amazing. It smells very manly, like a perfect example of what masculinity smells like. My only complaint is the hang time. It doesn&#x27;t last very long. You will need to replenish your smell every few hours.</li>
    <li> This cologne is my husband&#x27;s favorite. We first bought it on our honeymoon in Bermuda over 32 years ago! It&#x27;s not easy to find and, generally, it&#x27;s overpriced if you do. The Amazon price was great and  I enjoyed surprising my husband with this romantic cologne for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Everyone appears to enjoy the scent.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and don&#x27;t really care for anything else.  .</li>
    <li> Either really old or really fake</li>
    <li> Smells great. I wish this would come with the spray top but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> fair price,  my husband loves this product</li>
    <li> Poorly packed.  Arrived broken.  I did get my money back.  No complaint with that.  I learned since that the formula for this classic product has changed and cheapened.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS COLOGNE FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND I REALLY LIKE IT&lt;br /&gt;ITS NOW MADE IN NY  I PERFER IT FROM BERMUDA AS I THINK BERMUDA IS STRONGER</li>
    <li> I have preferred this cologne for several years.  It should be worn with care not to overdue and irritate others as all perfumes are allergens to many asthmatics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the light fragrance and lasting qualities. Inexpensive when used sparingly the bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for anumber of years, but it is somewhat difficult to find. Normally we would purchase this item at vacation locations or at manufactures outlet malls. Being able to purchase it on line has made this easier. I think it is a classic fragrence that often draws compliments, but is never offensive.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this exclusively since the day we discovered it in a men&#x27;s clothing store about 10 years ago.  I love it, he loves it.  I never get tired of it and he gets compliments on it when we are out.  Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve have found.  I&#x27;ve never seen it in a department store or a perfume shop, so it is quite the secret scent.  We love this one so much we have not even ventured to try the other two fragrances made by the same company.  Might have to do that some day -- or not.</li>
    <li> Royal Muske is a fantastic aftershave. Makes my skin feel great and my wife LOVES it. I get compliments  every time I wear it from coworkers.</li>
    <li> Has a classic scent that feels very natural, not fussy or contrived.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and I love it. The size and price of $27 is a steal (I&#x27;m used to paying $40 per 4 oz bottle)..I get compliments on the fragrance constantly.... Highly reccomend...</li>
    <li> I have searched and have yet to find a fragrance as simultaneously sensual and classic as this. It is important to note that due to the alcohol content, the scent will by no means seem youthful, but it is undeniably dignified and nostalgic. Some of my friends have said it smells a bit like church incense with a hint of mint. Before purchasing it, take a trip to your local Brooks Brothers and decide whether or not it&#x27;s for you. They usually have testers available there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royall Muske for many years now and I always get compliments!!  (mostly from good looking women, of course.)</li>
    <li> I had to stop wearing this because beautiful women wouldn&#x27;t stop following me around and trying to &amp;#34;hug&amp;#34; me.  It became such a problem that I have to lock my doors and just wear it at home.  Powerful stuff, be careful players!</li>
    <li> This cologne is AWESOME, I have used it for years and the price at Amazon was AMAZING compared to others.  I will be back!!</li>
    <li> This aftershave has a classic musk scent.  It gives you the sense of just having walked into an old barber shop.  The initial impact is rather sweet, though that wears off fairly quickly.  My only complaint is that this is rather strong stuff, and if you don&#x27;t use a light hand in applying it, you&#x27;re moving into the \\&quot;overpowering\\&quot; range...</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  Long lasting but not overpowering smell, with a subtle odor.  The bottle last me for several years.</li>
    <li> Sums it up.  This is not s good product or cologne.  The fragrance seems mostly to be sandalwood--which is actually a scent I quite like, but Royall Muske employs it in such a way that smells cheap and unsophisticated.  It also wears off incredibly quickly--usually within half an hour (1 hour max).  This product was made in the US--looks like the other reviews are correct.  The US version of this product is not good.  I wish I could try the Bermuda made version of Royall Muske.  I tried really hard to made sure that was the kind I was getting.  I wrote Amazon and they said they did not know, but I could order it an return it if it was not what I wanted.  Well, it is definitely not what I wanted, and I hope they will let me return it--but it has been difficult, because they won&#x27;t let you ship back flammable liquids.  If an Amazon rep reads this, could you please help me with the return process of this item?</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful fragrance that lasts for the complete day. The purchase price was very fair and beat other sources.My husband has been using it for years.</li>
