      <li>This is even more cute in person than in the picture.</li>
      <li>and i just love using it.  </li>
      <li>They work so good and love that they are cheetah so much!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
      <li>They were ok not bad ....</li>
      <li>They sure are cute but don&#x27;t really get the job done.</li>
      <li>Just like the picture, good brushes, many different sizes, and eye brow brush.</li>
      <li>Overall good deal</li>
      <li>Just received the product and service are well done, I love it and thanks...</li>
      <li>There could have been more blush (larger) brushes vs so many eye brushes.</li>

      <li>thanks.  </li>
      <li>she had said she needed a set of brushes and she really likes this set.  </li>
      <li>Not sure of the quality or durability, but it is adorable and just what I ordered.</li>
      <li>so I just ended up throwing out the set it came with and putting my old set in the case.</li>
      <li>I really like that the brushes are soft on the tips, though at first they can be kinda stiff, you just need to break them in.</li>
      <li>They have a cute design also with the carrying case thats small enough to fit into a small purse!  </li>
      <li>The product was small enough to fit in my make-up bag without looking bulky.</li>
      <li>After recieving the makeup brush set I was a little dissapointed to notice the brushes were pretty chealpy made</li>

<li> In the past i have gotten brushes where the bristles would fall off or weren&#x27;t soft, these ones are the complete opposite.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t know the quality of the brushes; I went by other user reviews.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Uses it everyday.</li>
<li> When I appled the make-up it came out very unevenly applied.</li>
<li> The bristles literally were falling out, and terrible quality.</li>
<li> You get what you pay for, but this is terrible.</li>

    <li> Not for daily use. I use this for travel only.</li>
    <li> This is even more cute in person than in the picture. The quality of the brushes seem well made, even though I haven&#x27;t used them yet. Very stylish, and very useful. A winner all the way around.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday she had said she needed a set of brushes and she really likes this set.  Especially the leopard print case.</li>

    <li> Purchased as a gift for a family member. She was very pleased with assortment and quality of brushes.  Compact enough to carry in purse.</li>
    <li> Just like the picture, good brushes, many different sizes, and eye brow brush. Leopard and cute! So worth the money.(:</li>
    <li> These brushes are made of plastic fiber and do not hold make-up powder well,or apply well. When I appled the make-up it came out very unevenly applied.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, but this is terrible. It&#x27;s a scratchy canvas material, and I couldn&#x27;t even give it as a present which is what it was intended for. The bristles literally were falling out, and terrible quality. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It was nice and was delivered on time, my daughter should love it. I don&#x27;t know what else to say, I prefer bigger brushes, but she won&#x27;t care I&#x27;m sure she will like it. It&#x27;s leopard her favorite so size won&#x27;t be an option.</li>
    <li> This is a gift so I don&#x27;t know the quality of the brushes; I went by other user reviews.  However, the case and brushes are beautiful.</li>
