      <li>They are OK for the price.</li>
      <li>I tried it but its powder thought it would look better on my skin</li>
      <li>its ok.</li>
      <li>Will order again when needed :)</li>
      <li>The container is huge, like an tablet.  </li>
      <li>and it cost more to return it to the U.S.  than it was worth.</li>
      <li>Looks great, and this is now a daily staple in my routine.</li>
      <li>It was not as described and when used it felt cheap.</li>
      <li>It has a lot of product,but very light no point really even the darkest color lacks pigmentation.</li>
      <li>Love trying new things.</li>
      <li>there are so many shades to contour with, however, the texture is very powdery, so I would recommend moisturizing before using, or else it won&#x27;t blend very well.</li>
      <li>The bronze color is nice but the highlights are not pigmented enough for contouring on lighter skin.</li>
      <li>far it&#x27;s my favorite out of all the contouring makeup I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
      <li>Worth the money</li>
      <li>This was the first product I bought to start experimenting with contouring.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but feels cheap :/</li>
      <li>It has all the colors nessesary for contouring, and I am a very tan complexion.</li>
      <li>I wanted a whole month for this.  </li>
      <li>These powders stay on really well.</li>
      <li>The palette is good but depending on the skin tone you will only use certain shades, so most of them aren&#x27;t even usable as I am pale and can&#x27;t use the dark colors.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a light powder not oil based like some of the other ones sold.  </li>
      <li>Professional quality.</li>
      <li>Powder is very soft and does last through the day.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
      <li>Far too large to carry in a purse or typical</li>

    <li> Being so inexpensive you&#x27;d think this product would be horrible... but it&#x27;s amazing! The packaging smells a lot like plastic but the product itself is great. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Use it everyday</li>
    <li> Professional quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but feels cheap :/</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected! Good colors it&#x27;s a light powder not oil based like some of the other ones sold.  Worth the money</li>
    <li> It has a lot of product,but very light no point really even the darkest color lacks pigmentation.</li>
    <li> Way bigger than I thought it&#x27;d be! They blend beautifully and stay all day!</li>
    <li> ordered this palette for my sister received it broken</li>
    <li> I suppose I&#x27;m just as absentminded as the seller because I didn&#x27;t think &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; was a typo and they meant &amp;#34;powder.&amp;#34; I tried to use this product and found it horrible. It was not as described and when used it felt cheap. This kit felt like it would make me break out. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. They are OK for the price. They lack pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I like that there are so many shades to contour with, however, the texture is very powdery, so I would recommend moisturizing before using, or else it won&#x27;t blend very well.</li>
    <li> These powders stay on really well.</li>
    <li> I got mine broken to pieces</li>
    <li> If I could give this less than one star I would. I order this on February 22 ans got it today, March 24.  I wanted a whole month for this.  And it came broken!  Powder everywhere.  Not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> This powder is so wonderul , I actually stopped wearing liquid foundation. It has all the colors nessesary for contouring, and I am a very tan complexion. Will order again when needed :)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend as well as I had hoped, but great for the price</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL AND CAN&#x27;T BEAT THE PRICE</li>
    <li> The palette is good but depending on the skin tone you will only use certain shades, so most of them aren&#x27;t even usable as I am pale and can&#x27;t use the dark colors. I would rather buy the shades I need and leave it that way.</li>
    <li> Not very good makeup quality. Does not last throughout the day and the colors don&#x27;t blend well. Would not recommended.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s actually pretty good! It blends nicely and has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;So far it&#x27;s my favorite out of all the contouring makeup I&#x27;ve bought. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received on time...but all broken, all mixed😕</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! El tamaño extraordinario.</li>
    <li> This really is good affordable palette for contouring!</li>
    <li> Colors don&#x27;t blend well and there is absolutely no applicator included.  The container is huge, like an tablet.  Far too large to carry in a purse or typical make-up bad.  Save yourself the inconvenience of having to return this or just throw it away, as I did because I am presently working and studying abroad and it cost more to return it to the U.S.  than it was worth.</li>
    <li> Love this contouring kit! Love trying new things. Powder is very soft and does last through the day. Colors are very nice and neutral and blend well. I was actually amazed at how big this pallet was.</li>
    <li> This was the first product I bought to start experimenting with contouring. I have combination skin, and honestly .. this powder is amazing. Does the trick well. Looks great, and this is now a daily staple in my routine. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> its ok. I tried it but its powder thought it would look better on my skin but it gives me a cake-y effect. I am going to give it one more try this weekend</li>
    <li> The bronze color is nice but the highlights are not pigmented enough for contouring on lighter skin. I will use this because I bought it but its not a go-to and I am still looking for a better contour set.</li>
