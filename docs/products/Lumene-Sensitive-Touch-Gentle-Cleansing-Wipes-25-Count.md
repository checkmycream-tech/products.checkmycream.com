### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Aside from that, Lumene is the best for sensitive/allergic skin.</li>
      <li>; but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
      <li>Great price here at amazon.com.</li>
      <li>GREAT DISTRIBUTOR.</li>
      <li>These have been s great decision.</li>
      <li>LOVE THEM!!</li>
      <li>but I am not taking off a star for that because the product is so good.</li>
      <li>love this product!</li>
      <li>I love these makeup remover wipes!  </li>
      <li>but this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Pleasant, light scent.  </li>
      <li>and I love the way they make my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>and I think they would do a better job at cleansing if that were the case.</li>
      <li>Lumene makes products that are top of the line</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off buying micelle water and wetting cotton pads to remove makeup or sunscreen.</li>
      <li>They are a lot lighter than most wipes I have tried.</li>
      <li>The sensitive cleansing wipes are very gentle on the skin and certainly do an awesome job of removing the makeup.  </li>
      <li>These seem to be the best I&#x27;ve found, even though a little pricey.</li>
      <li>Remove makeup effectively but feel kind of dry.</li>
      <li>The only place I ever find these wipes is at CVS, but they don&#x27;t always have them, so it&#x27;s nice to know they are available on amazon as well :)</li>
      <li>Leaves skin clean with no residue.</li>
      <li>Lumene facial cleansing wipes are truly THE best for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I thought that it probably wasn&#x27;t going to clean that</li>
      <li>I read about these in Beautypedia and thought they&#x27;d be special</li>
      <li>These were very dry and did not do a great job at cleansing.</li>
      <li>They really need more product on/in them</li>
      <li>They leave your face feeling clean &amp; fresh without residue/feeling damp.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild and goest way quickly.</li>
      <li>Okay, I admit, the top wipes were a bit on the dry side, but still usable.</li>
      <li>I work near a recycling plant and wanted to get something I could use at work to wipe off the residue, but after I tested the product and followed with toner/cottonball, way more stuff came off on the cottonball than the wipe.</li>
      <li>They may seem overpriced but compared to the others it is worth it.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve turned the package upside down to see if the wipes will gain more of the cleansing solution onto the top wipes in the package.</li>
      <li>This cleansing wipe is incredibly gentle yet so effective; with just a few swipes I was able to take off my eye and face makeup  -</li>
      <li>short, it&#x27;s extremely gentle and extremely effective.</li>
      <li>How much is your skin worth?</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely stock more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but when they are 2.79 each I will buy them at that price because this brand tends to be higher priced than others</li>
      <li>my skin red and patchy, smelled of petroleum based oils, and felt more like smearing than cleansing.</li>
      <li>These work very well, including removing waterproof eyebrow color!</li>
      <li>Shoulda thought of that in the first place.</li>
      <li>Skin feels soft and smooth after using.  </li>
      <li>I first took one out of the package</li>
      <li>Nobody needs any kind of fragrance on their complexion -- it can be an irritant, especially to those of us with very sensitive and reactive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product many times from the local drug store and have never had that problem, so am assuming that the seller sent very old packages.</li>
      <li>They are gentle and do not cause any issues with my skin.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very prone to breakouts with oily skin.</li>
      <li>When I use the others the are literally dripping too much liquid</li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every make and brand and haven&#x27;t really found too much of a difference between them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>One star for being made with gentle ingredients.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>Great face wipes I finally found the non irritating wipes that leave your face feeling clean</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m down to about the top quarter of the package/wipes and the wipes are moister.</li>
      <li>Purchased these b/c it looks as though they&#x27;ve been rated fairly high for &amp;#34;best</li>
      <li>They remove makeup thoroughly but feel as soft as fine cotton (in fact they are actually made of some sort of natural cotton fiber).</li>
      <li>I normally have to wait a while or go bargain hunting on the internet for some</li>
      <li>Kind of a rough texture, makes it harder to get off makeup.</li>
      <li>Make sure you close the package very tightly, and I keep mine in the re-sealable clear plastic bag that the package was sent in.</li>
      <li>I turned the package top side down, well sealed and inside another bag, and that definitely did the trick.</li>
      <li>The nice thing about these wipes, which is very hard to find in facial wipes, is they&#x27;re gentle and have no fragrance.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin with eczema.</li>
      <li>I would recommend the cleansing wipes to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Maybe I received an old batch???</li>
      <li>I say on a whim because they were for sure more expensive than all of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I usually have trouble taking off my mascara effectively.</li>
      <li>These are the only facial wipes I&#x27;ve found that are gentle enough for daily use.</li>
      <li>Other than that I highly highly recommend them; I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying them from this seller.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a long time now and always end up going back to them.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re also far cheaper than the fancy-branded ones I was buying fro, sephora previously.</li>
<li> but I was surprised how little showed up after using the Lumeme wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but they&#x27;re the same as any other wipe.</li>
<li> Have to agree with others who said these cloths are very dry.</li>
<li> The cleansing cloths were very dry.</li>

<li> but I&#x27;ve given only 3 because the wipes in both packages that I purchased from this seller were dried out.</li>
<li> Lumene wipes are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that remove my mascara thoroughly without excessive wiping and irritation.  </li>
<li> They also don&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy like a lot of other makeup remover wipes.  </li>
<li> but they don&#x27;t advertise one bit like other brands.</li>
<li> Only downside- they are a little bit pricier than other brands and can be hard to find; not all drug stores carry them.</li>
<li> I think that might help, or you could even use a food storage bag that seals tight.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think they contain anything irritating, but I had to actually wet them to get them to work, and the cloths were a little rough.</li>
<li> I use a Clarisonic cleanser/skin care brush afterwards and usually it shows makeup residue and dirt -</li>
<li> They contain no alcohol or anything that feels harsh, but work so well to remove makeup its ridiculous.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed because it didn&#x27;t feel really wet</li>
<li> Note to self: DUH!</li>
<li> They take all my makeup off, and I don&#x27;t wake up broken out.</li>
<li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
<li> Too bad.</li>
<li> and I was shocked when CVS took four dollars of the purchase price.</li>

    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin with eczema. These are the only facial wipes I&#x27;ve found that are gentle enough for daily use.</li>
    <li> The cleansing cloths were very dry.</li>
    <li> Okay, I admit, the top wipes were a bit on the dry side, but still usable. Now I&#x27;m down to about the top quarter of the package/wipes and the wipes are moister. So I&#x27;ve turned the package upside down to see if the wipes will gain more of the cleansing solution onto the top wipes in the package. Make sure you close the package very tightly, and I keep mine in the re-sealable clear plastic bag that the package was sent in. I think that might help, or you could even use a food storage bag that seals tight. The nice thing about these wipes, which is very hard to find in facial wipes, is they&#x27;re gentle and have no fragrance. Nobody needs any kind of fragrance on their complexion -- it can be an irritant, especially to those of us with very sensitive and reactive skin. These work very well, including removing waterproof eyebrow color! Would I buy them again? Yes! These seem to be the best I&#x27;ve found, even though a little pricey. How much is your skin worth? That&#x27;s what you must decide for yourself. I have only one face and I&#x27;ll definitely stock more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/22/15: I turned the package top side down, well sealed and inside another bag, and that definitely did the trick. Note to self: DUH! Shoulda thought of that in the first place.</li>
    <li> These were very dry and did not do a great job at cleansing. One star for being made with gentle ingredients. They really need more product on/in them and I think they would do a better job at cleansing if that were the case. I ended up tossing them.</li>
    <li> I use cleansing wipes all the time and have bought them for years. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every make and brand and haven&#x27;t really found too much of a difference between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 weeks ago I got these from my local drugstore on a whim. I say on a whim because they were for sure more expensive than all of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first took one out of the package I was a little disappointed because it didn&#x27;t feel really wet -so I thought that it probably wasn&#x27;t going to clean that well. Boy was I wrong. This cleansing wipe is incredibly gentle yet so effective; with just a few swipes I was able to take off my eye and face makeup  - and I usually have trouble taking off my mascara effectively. I use a Clarisonic cleanser/skin care brush afterwards and usually it shows makeup residue and dirt - but I was surprised how little showed up after using the Lumeme wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s extremely gentle and extremely effective. The only drawback is the price but I am not taking off a star for that because the product is so good. And I guess you get what you pay for in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Remove makeup effectively but feel kind of dry.</li>
    <li> I love these makeup remover wipes!  I&#x27;ve been using them for a long time now and always end up going back to them.  They are gentle and do not cause any issues with my skin.  They also don&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy like a lot of other makeup remover wipes.  The only place I ever find these wipes is at CVS, but they don&#x27;t always have them, so it&#x27;s nice to know they are available on amazon as well :)</li>
    <li> Other brands from drugstore chains irritate my eyes (which are not all THAT sensitive).  Lumene wipes are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that remove my mascara thoroughly without excessive wiping and irritation.  Pleasant, light scent.  Great price here at amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Lumene facial cleansing wipes are truly THE best for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s a 5 star product but I&#x27;ve given only 3 because the wipes in both packages that I purchased from this seller were dried out. I&#x27;ve bought this product many times from the local drug store and have never had that problem, so am assuming that the seller sent very old packages. For this reason I won&#x27;t buy them online again. Aside from that, Lumene is the best for sensitive/allergic skin. They remove makeup thoroughly but feel as soft as fine cotton (in fact they are actually made of some sort of natural cotton fiber). They contain no alcohol or anything that feels harsh, but work so well to remove makeup its ridiculous. Only downside- they are a little bit pricier than other brands and can be hard to find; not all drug stores carry them. Other than that I highly highly recommend them; I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying them from this seller.</li>
    <li> I read about these in Beautypedia and thought they&#x27;d be special but they&#x27;re the same as any other wipe. Kind of a rough texture, makes it harder to get off makeup.</li>
    <li> I have used Lumene Skin Care Products for about 2 years and I love the way they make my skin feel.  The sensitive cleansing wipes are very gentle on the skin and certainly do an awesome job of removing the makeup.  Skin feels soft and smooth after using.  I would recommend the cleansing wipes to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I feel compelled to write a review for this because I have been using these wipes for years and I have used others like Garnier and Olay but there is a big difference. When I use the others the are literally dripping too much liquid but this product is amazing. They may seem overpriced but compared to the others it is worth it. I went to my local CVS because I remembered I wanted another Lumene product was on clearance and I was shocked when CVS took four dollars of the purchase price. There must have been stars in my eyes. I bought 4 packs it may seem like alot but when they are 2.79 each I will buy them at that price because this brand tends to be higher priced than others but I can see why. It just makes me want to wipe my face all day with these cloths. I normally have to wait a while or go bargain hunting on the internet for some but yeah not anymore. Lumene makes products that are top of the line but they don&#x27;t advertise one bit like other brands. I think they stay afloat because once you stumble upon the brand you notice how others are lacking.</li>
    <li> Purchased these b/c it looks as though they&#x27;ve been rated fairly high for &amp;#34;best wipes&amp;#34; but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  The towelettes didn&#x27;t seem damp enough to remove make up.  Maybe I received an old batch???</li>
    <li> I LOOVVVEEEE these! They are a lot lighter than most wipes I have tried. They leave your face feeling clean &amp; fresh without residue/feeling damp. Try em!</li>
    <li> Wished this worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;Left my skin red and patchy, smelled of petroleum based oils, and felt more like smearing than cleansing. I work near a recycling plant and wanted to get something I could use at work to wipe off the residue, but after I tested the product and followed with toner/cottonball, way more stuff came off on the cottonball than the wipe. I also got a a few pimples after a second attempt. Too bad.</li>
    <li> Have to agree with others who said these cloths are very dry. I don&#x27;t think they contain anything irritating, but I had to actually wet them to get them to work, and the cloths were a little rough. You&#x27;re better off buying micelle water and wetting cotton pads to remove makeup or sunscreen. Would not order them again.</li>
    <li> Great face wipes I finally found the non irritating wipes that leave your face feeling clean, I use two when i wear makeup to take everything i can off. they don&#x27;t have any fragrance and they don make me break out and I&#x27;m very prone to breakouts with oily skin. LOVE THEM!!</li>
    <li> love this product! Leaves skin clean with no residue. Will buy again and again! Spread the word! GREAT DISTRIBUTOR. THANKS</li>
    <li> I switched to these after reading some reviews on beautypedia. These have been s great decision. They take all my makeup off, and I don&#x27;t wake up broken out. The scent is mild and goest way quickly. They&#x27;re also far cheaper than the fancy-branded ones I was buying fro, sephora previously. I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
