      <li>It took along time to find, but this color is perfect.</li>
      <li>This color is perfect for that.</li>
      <li>OPI is the best nail polish out there.</li>
      <li>Its beautiful and</li>
      <li>OPI Nail Lacquer is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Looks great with a tan.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to put a couple of coats to get more of a color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great too if you work somewhere where you can&#x27;t have bright nails.</li>
      <li>Good shade</li>
      <li>So nice to get it at a good price on Amazon where I do all my shopping.  </li>
      <li>and i love it!</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite neutral color!</li>
      <li>Love OPI!  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t Touch my Tutu is elegant and understated while looking gorgeous on your hands.  </li>
      <li>So I decided to purchase my own polishes to take with me.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something that was more opaque, but this one is more of a shimmery topcoat that still looks nice, even by itself.</li>
      <li>Color is very, very light and somewhat pearly.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and in good shape.  </li>
      <li>This is a lovely color.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how many times you paint your nails</li>
      <li>I love the name as well.  </li>
      <li>Why pay more for beauty items anywhere else?  </li>
      <li>it goes well with so many skin tones.</li>
      <li>Love that I can mail order from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I was expecting better coverage with an OPI lacquer than this</li>
      <li>The color is lovely for spring, summer.  </li>
      <li>It was easy and they look SO</li>
      <li>It has a beautiful clean white sheen.</li>
      <li>This polish fit the bill.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You could also use two coats of this polish over the whole nail as a nice neutral color.</li>
      <li>It was really light.</li>
      <li>Way to light.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>OPI Nail Lacquer Limited Edition New York City Ballet Collection is just wonderful.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice soft color for every day use and I would buy again.</li>
      <li>Most days, I like to wear very neutral nail polish shades.</li>
      <li>I needed 4 to get it to appear full coverage</li>
      <li>therefore, it&#x27;s good as a topper for French manis, or to use in jelly sandwiches.  </li>
      <li>Yes, you can get a more noticeable (and very elegant) transparent white look if you do 2-4 coats, but only if you have smooth, even, ridge-free nails...</li>
      <li>Very classy and easy to wear.</li>
      <li>try it with the glitter top coat from the same collection (pirouette my whistle)</li>
      <li>Now I have to spend more money and find a real white.</li>
      <li>I have tried essie waltz and its just too much of a hassle its too darn streaky!</li>
      <li>one coat give you a perfect french manicure, two coats for a translucent white, and three coats for opaque white.</li>
      <li>The color goes on perfectly and unlike other milky light colors i feel like this one hardly streaks.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a pure white, this one is okay for making polish look opal affect but not for using as nail art.</li>
      <li>Glad I ordered it before the limited edition is gone.</li>
      <li>There is no true color since it is very transparent, but great for French mani or someone with no nails looking for something to help them put a sheen on them while trying yo grow out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say the picture color matches what you will get on your nails very well.</li>
      <li>It gives my nails a sheer white glossy color which I love.</li>
      <li>Opi&#x27;s Funny Bunny is a little darker and allows you to have more color with double coat.</li>
      <li>It leaves your nails looking natural and shiny!</li>
      <li>might as well buy clear nail polish</li>
      <li>It looks like a clear coat.</li>
      <li>In nursing school we are only allowed to wear light pink or nude polish.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s almost clear.</li>
      <li>the color was to clear not a fan at all...</li>
      <li>and at that point it stood out almost too much for a corporate environment.</li>
      <li>It looks so classy and the compliments are nonstop.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth it to try to put on enough coats to make it look white.</li>
      <li>A sheer white jelly formula polish that looks great at one coat, but is sooo sheer that it&#x27;s barely THERE at one coat... looks almost clear, hardly milky at all...  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you like the look of a French manicure.</li>
      <li>This particular color is a sheer white.  </li>
      <li>natural looking french tips with no problem at all.  </li>
      <li>I simply used a tiny bit on the tips of my nails, then polished over them with my usual light colored polish, and it looks like a spa manicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not dark enough</li>
      <li>It is very subtle but elegant</li>
      <li>It is a little sheer and takes several coats if you want full white coverage.  </li>

<li> it&#x27;s not that hard to paint a straight line across the end of your nails!  </li>
<li> Extremely runny, no seal, very watered down.</li>
<li> Put on properly, it lasts a long time and does not chip!!!</li>
<li> I just wanted a matte white that would show up on dark colors (when painting a flower, etc.)</li>
<li> I have yet to find a dupe for this color since it was a limited edition!</li>
<li> However, my nails tend to be a little yellow</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> If you are looking for a pearlizing technique this one is it but for plain white it is not.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve recently moved to a small town where finding any place to buy salon quality products is not available.  </li>
<li> And the small salon&#x27;s often have a limited selection of colors.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like the look of long, fake looking french manicures that looks like someone used white-out on them.  </li>
<li> After a few coats, looks streaky.</li>
<li> You could probably something similar in a physical store, but for an add-on item it wasn&#x27;t too bad of a deal.</li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>

    <li> Arrived quickly and in good shape.  The color is lovely for spring, summer.  Just a touch of color on nails.  Will use all spring/summer on nails.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a pearlizing technique this one is it but for plain white it is not.  I was looking for a pure white, this one is okay for making polish look opal affect but not for using as nail art.</li>
    <li> Good shade if you want a white appearance.</li>
    <li> Love OPI!  One of only two (maybe three) ways I splurge and spoil myself is to get pedicures.  I&#x27;ve recently moved to a small town where finding any place to buy salon quality products is not available.  And the small salon&#x27;s often have a limited selection of colors.  So I decided to purchase my own polishes to take with me. Love that I can mail order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very sheer.  I love it</li>
    <li> This is a lovely color. It&#x27;s best to put a couple of coats to get more of a color. I&#x27;d say the picture color matches what you will get on your nails very well.

    <li> Here&#x27;s the deal. . .  I don&#x27;t like the look of long, fake looking french manicures that looks like someone used white-out on them.  I tend to keep my nails short and in a neutral color.  However, my nails tend to be a little yellow (yuck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Opi color was the answer to my problems.  I simply used a tiny bit on the tips of my nails, then polished over them with my usual light colored polish, and it looks like a spa manicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very natural looking french tips with no problem at all.  I didn&#x27;t use tape or anything;  it&#x27;s not that hard to paint a straight line across the end of your nails!  It was easy and they look SO good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could also use two coats of this polish over the whole nail as a nice neutral color.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite neutral color! its a &#x27;jelly&#x27; white. one coat give you a perfect french manicure, two coats for a translucent white, and three coats for opaque white. try it with the glitter top coat from the same collection (pirouette my whistle)</li>
    <li> There is no true color since it is very transparent, but great for French mani or someone with no nails looking for something to help them put a sheen on them while trying yo grow out.  Opi&#x27;s Funny Bunny is a little darker and allows you to have more color with double coat.</li>
    <li> In nursing school we are only allowed to wear light pink or nude polish. This polish fit the bill. It looks so classy and the compliments are nonstop.</li>
    <li> I thought this was really white and it&#x27;s not. I just wanted a matte white that would show up on dark colors (when painting a flower, etc.) and this does not. Now I have to spend more money and find a real white. So if you want a white-ish color, this one is for you.</li>
    <li> It was really light. Not what I expected. It looks like a clear coat. Doesn&#x27;t matter how many times you paint your nails it&#x27;s not dark enough</li>
    <li> I was expecting better coverage with an OPI lacquer than this gives.&lt;br /&gt;It takes several coats for the paint not to be transparent.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle that ive bought and i love it! I have yet to find a dupe for this color since it was a limited edition! The color goes on perfectly and unlike other milky light colors i feel like this one hardly streaks. Its beautiful and it goes well with so many skin tones. I have tried essie waltz and its just too much of a hassle its too darn streaky! This color and formula is heaven sent.  Will reorder again!!!!</li>
    <li> Way to light. After a few coats, looks streaky. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I like the polish well enough. I was looking for something that was more opaque, but this one is more of a shimmery topcoat that still looks nice, even by itself. You could probably something similar in a physical store, but for an add-on item it wasn&#x27;t too bad of a deal.</li>
    <li> OPI is the best nail polish out there. Put on properly, it lasts a long time and does not chip!!!</li>
    <li> Extremely runny, no seal, very watered down. Not what I have come to expect from OPI.</li>
    <li> Thought this product was supposed to be white but it&#x27;s almost clear. It wasn&#x27;t worth it to try to put on enough coats to make it look white.</li>
    <li> might as well buy clear nail polish</li>
    <li> the color was to clear not a fan at all...</li>
    <li> This is a sort of milky white nail color.  It is a little sheer and takes several coats if you want full white coverage.  It is a nice soft color for every day use and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of OPI nail polishes anyway, and this was a shade I&#x27;ve been wanting to try. Most days, I like to wear very neutral nail polish shades. I like my nails to look neat and polished but not necessarily stand out. This color is perfect for that. It gives my nails a sheer white glossy color which I love. It is very subtle but elegant</li>
    <li> OPI Nail Lacquer is a great product.  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  This particular color is a sheer white.  If you applied enough coats, I guess you could make it opaque.</li>
    <li> A sheer white jelly formula polish that looks great at one coat, but is sooo sheer that it&#x27;s barely THERE at one coat... looks almost clear, hardly milky at all...  therefore, it&#x27;s good as a topper for French manis, or to use in jelly sandwiches.  Yes, you can get a more noticeable (and very elegant) transparent white look if you do 2-4 coats, but only if you have smooth, even, ridge-free nails... otherwise, the finish does not appear even.</li>
    <li> Color is very, very light and somewhat pearly. At one coat it was unnoticeable, 2 seemed incomplete, and 3 was a tad streaky. I needed 4 to get it to appear full coverage and at that point it stood out almost too much for a corporate environment. I&#x27;d recommend viewing in person if possible, as you cannot return nail polish purchased through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Touch my Tutu is elegant and understated while looking gorgeous on your hands.  I discovered it in a nail shop on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica.  I found it on Amazon the very next day.  I&#x27;ve already ordered it twice.  I never want to be without it.  I will wear it the rest of my life.  It&#x27;s a sheer white glossy and two coats make my hands just glimmer.  I&#x27;ve received compliments about my polish wherever I go.  So nice to get it at a good price on Amazon where I do all my shopping.  Why pay more for beauty items anywhere else?  I love the name as well.  It&#x27;s a fierce name for a woman&#x27;s nail polish.</li>
    <li> OPI Nail Lacquer Limited Edition New York City Ballet Collection is just wonderful.  Looks great with a tan. Glad I ordered it before the limited edition is gone.</li>
