      <li>Not too heavy, but has a great creamy texture.</li>
      <li>The price kind of made me think twice about buying it again, but let me tell you, when I ran out and went back to moisturizers I had been using before there was no contest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Great product for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I actually love the feel of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bare Minerals.</li>

      <li>(it&#x27;s kind of heavy but doesn&#x27;t feel that way when you put it on) and a nice natural scent.</li>
      <li>AND, best of all, its not in a squeeze tube, which means you can get all of it out, and when you travel on a plane, its small enough to go in your carry-on, and won&#x27;t get squeezed out in a pressurized cabin!  </li>
      <li>Not heavily scented, smooth to go on.</li>
      <li>You will be hooked after the first application.</li>
      <li>This stuff makes your face so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Never fails to disappoint.</li>
      <li>Very creamy and light, with a nice subtle scent.</li>

      <li>It lasts all day and works really well with the BareMinerals powder makeup.</li>

      <li>It leaves your skin soooo soft!!!  </li>
      <li>Winter left dryness on my face, tried many , must say Bare Minerals was the winner!</li>
      <li>This does a very nice job of moisturizing my face, but it is a bit pricey for such a small amount.  </li>
      <li>Hands down, this is my favorite moisturizer ever.</li>
      <li>I decided to give BareMinerals a try because of what others who had used that particular product said about it.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>When I purchased this I was a little hesitant but fell in love with it and made my husband try it</li>

      <li>/&gt;it was new unused.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and now we can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>Overall is a nice cream, heavier rather than lighter - likely since it&#x27;s made for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Bare Essentuals bareMinerals Skincare Purely Nourishing Cream:  </li>
      <li>I tried this stuff and WOW!</li>
      <li>It takes care of all these problems and my skin is so soft!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this face cream... I have an incredibly hard time finding a face moisturizer that works for my skin. I am prone to breakouts and have very oily areas, yet my skin dries out very easily as well. This works perfectly for my skin - it keeps it soft and moisturizes without ever leaving it greasy. I can wear it under makeup and my makeup still looks great at the end of the day. My new absolute favorite!</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin. This product works well for me, especially during the dry winter months.  I typically it as a night moisturizer, but sometimes also use it as base moisturizer under makeup when I am in drier climates.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  Very creamy and light, with a nice subtle scent.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin all year round so I&#x27;ve been searching for a moisturizer than can actually pack a punch.&lt;br /&gt;It has a really nice texture (it&#x27;s kind of heavy but doesn&#x27;t feel that way when you put it on) and a nice natural scent. For the most part it seems to do a great job moisturizing. My skin feels softer and looks glowier...but it also causes me to break out horribly. With a few hours of using it I had big painful zits emerging. So now I use it to spot treat dry flaky patches of skin...that seemed to help the breakout issue. But for now I&#x27;ll keep searching for that magic moisturizer</li>
    <li> This stuff really works for really dry skin, when nothing else will. This brand is so great you should feel good about using their products.We all need to be very careful what we put on our skin, it is the largest organ of the human body and it absorbs everything you put on it. So if its crappy ingredients that you can&#x27;t pronounce, probably shouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> although a bit expensive i totally love bare minerals stuff. my skin loves it too and they make good products. i have dry flakey skin at times. oily kinda. like teflon-like cream. people with oily skin probably would not like it.</li>
    <li> Bare Essentuals bareMinerals Skincare Purely Nourishing Cream:  Dry Skin is a part of my daily cleansing routine.  Bare Minerals is the brand of cleansing products I use and love.</li>
    <li> Love it! Thick and light all at the same time.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer by Bare Minerals is wonderful for all skin types.  It leaves your skin soooo soft!!!  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of moisturizers, but this is the very best.</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie with sensitive dry skin and have tried fancier creams, organic creams, and drugstore creams, and I always come back to this. The perfect amount of moisture.</li>
    <li> I have always had dry skin and in the winter it&#x27;s worse.  I originally bought this directly from Bare Escentuals, used it and thought it was really good.  The price kind of made me think twice about buying it again, but let me tell you, when I ran out and went back to moisturizers I had been using before there was no contest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY moisturizer I have found that works all day.  Before using this, I had to use at least 2 applications of my other moisturizer and by the end of the day, my skin was still dry.  Being post menopausal doesn&#x27;t help my skin any either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it may be a bit pricey to some, but the affect on my skin has been amazing.  If you have dry skin, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  I have heard that some people also use it for night cream.</li>
    <li> This is the solution for dry sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Gewat product! I love it</li>
    <li> All bare minerals are so amazing! And this paticular item is one of my favorite items and love the way it makes my skin feel!!!</li>
    <li> Very rich and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Helps my dry skin and rosacea immensely.  Feels creamy and absorbs quickly.  Love it. Lesley has outdone herself again. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for a year or so and it has worked wonders with my dry and sun damaged face. My wrinkles are a lot softer now. I actually love the feel of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bare Minerals.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. Dries quickly. Leaves face feeling very hydrated. Not too heavy, but has a great creamy texture. Has helped reduced flakiness</li>
    <li> I always used to be a moisturiser junkie.  Every store that had any new moisturiser for dry skin, or claimed to reduce wrinkles or whatever... I had to have it.  I spend thousands of dollars on trying to find something I liked.  I swapped all my makeup to Bare Minerals back in 2006.  I haven&#x27;t looked back, and when I discovered this moisturiser, I had to try it.  Well, my junkie habit has been cured!  This stuff goes on smooth, feels like velvet, moisturises all day, and again for all night.  I have no breakouts, and no dry skin patches.  People have told me I look 10 years younger than I am!  I haven&#x27;t noticed less lines, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones, either, so I guess it works.  I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and this stuff is amazing.  And its really very affordable.  AND, best of all, its not in a squeeze tube, which means you can get all of it out, and when you travel on a plane, its small enough to go in your carry-on, and won&#x27;t get squeezed out in a pressurized cabin!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!  please, never change it!</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer.  Not greasy and it absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and make sure I am never without it. My skin always looks nice and soft even in my 60&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old and don&#x27;t really have any acne, but in the last year have struggled with irritated, red  and itchy skin&lt;br /&gt;that comes and goes. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of creams and even got some prescribed by my determatologist.&lt;br /&gt;None have even helped the symptoms. Obviously this is not a \\&quot;fix all\\&quot; and i still randomly get dry,red and itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, this is the only cream I have found that calms the irritation and reduces the redness. It is very heavy so when I use it&lt;br /&gt;during the day I only apply it to the problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, absorb well.</li>
    <li> I have worn this product for at leats 15 and stated wearing the cream about three years ago. It does a good job day and night.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, and it is very nourishing to my skin type (getting older, dry skin). I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream over an year now and I really love it.</li>
    <li> At first I really enjoyed this product. However, I began to notice that my skin was more oily after I began using it and soon after I began breaking out. I stopped using it for a while and my skin cleared up. Wanting to give it another chance, because I have their foundation and love it, I used it again. Within a few days I was back to oily skin and breaking out. This might be good for some people, it has really good reviews. However, for me it was too heavy and ended up making me break out and get really oily skin, something I usually don&#x27;t really worry about.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin. this does the trick for me.</li>
    <li> My go-to moisturizer for years. Never fails to disappoint.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay nothing special</li>
    <li> Bought for cousin, he loves it.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your face so smooth and soft.You will be hooked after the first application.Before I used this product I had dry splotches all over my face.The next morning it was still working great.Felt like I had just put it on.</li>
    <li> It was what i expected it to be a a great price great deal</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Glad I found it on Amazon because the company was sold out when I needed more.  This really helps with my patches of dry skin on my face.</li>
    <li> Hands down, this is my favorite moisturizer ever. I especially like using it around my eyes and tops of my cheeks because it does not have a scent, which I&#x27;m ridiculously sensitive to. It also calms the redness in my skin as it moisturizes.</li>
    <li> Use it every day. I can tell a difference on days I don&#x27;t remember to put it on. Not oil at all either.</li>
    <li> Slightly better than the cheaper stuff in stores.</li>
    <li> Item came not in usual bareMinerals packaging, making me question it&#x27;s authenticity and/or why it didn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s usual packaging. Overall is a nice cream, heavier rather than lighter - likely since it&#x27;s made for dry skin. Not heavily scented, smooth to go on. Does make my face feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; after several hours, and I could never wear it under makeup as I do some of the bareMinerals other moisturizers. I would have to purchase again from a non-amazon retailer, i.e. Sephora, etc. and see if my experience was the same -and if perhaps if was not - perhaps I have a non-authentic item this time. All of my other experiences with bareMinerals products have been wonderful.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, exceeded expectations!</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this on my skin!</li>
    <li> I have very dry flaky skin. I also get bad rosacea in the winter. This moisturizer is the best. It takes care of all these problems and my skin is so soft!</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I have combination skin that is dry and flaky in the winter.  This products works great.  I have not had a problem this winter since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I have incredibly sensitive skin. Anything can make us break out. When I purchased this I was a little hesitant but fell in love with it and made my husband try it and now we can&#x27;t live without it. It&#x27;s great for him because it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance. Just a great moisturizer!!!</li>
    <li> I had been using Clinique Moisture Surge Intense, but I still found that my skin was just sopping it up and my skin was still very dry.  I decided to give BareMinerals a try because of what others who had used that particular product said about it.  Well let me tell you it works wonderfully.  Thankfully, the dryness cleared up and I&#x27;ll continue to use this &amp;#34;Great Product&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This does a very nice job of moisturizing my face, but it is a bit pricey for such a small amount.  It lasts all day and works really well with the BareMinerals powder makeup.</li>
    <li> I bought CeraVe thinking that it would help with winter skin and although it did help, it still gave me a burning sensation and the ingredients were harsh. I tried this stuff and WOW! I think I found my HG skin care moisturizer for winter and on those days when there is a little dry skin that&#x27;s visible! THANK YOU BE, I am a fan all over again especially with this skin care and also your matte foundation! I have sensitive skin and for some reason BE works for me and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and this moisturizer did not burn whatsoever but my skin drank it up and it looked soooo hydrated and that never happens...stuff usually just sits on my face and this sinks in like my face oils! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Best moisturizing cream I have EVER found</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer for my 76 yr old skin.  I finally found the perfect product and am so pleased.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and makes my skin soft. It takes more than other moisturizers I have used in the past to cover my skin though. I do have to reapply powder at least once during the day because it makes my skin slightly oily.</li>
    <li> I have the driest skin there is.  Excellent product.  Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I do really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;it was new unused.&lt;br /&gt;delivery was fast, packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the moisturizer, just wish it had SPF, my mistake. I thought that was what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night after washing my makeup off at end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oit goes on great, not greasy at all. not heavy.  no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Not only does this product moisturize and reduce wrinkles (I&#x27;m in my 50s), but it&#x27;s just about the only moisturizer on the market that does not contain cetyl alcohol, which I am allergic to. It absorbs well and is non greasy.</li>
    <li> This was really too thick for my skin and left a shiny film on my face, just wrong for me though, not a bad product.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh! What a GREAT product! This cream is wonderful! I bought this cream to help my dry &amp; sagging face &amp; neck &amp; got the best product I have ever tried. It makes your skin so soft, smooth, &amp; supple! I will be using this cream from now on! I apply it morning &amp; night.</li>
    <li> I have tried hundreds of moisturizers for dry skin, and all have bothered my already horrendous acne the same.  This, although meant for women and quite expensive, did wonders.  I use it daily and it has not affected my acne a single bit!  In fact it may have made it easier to control my acne!  I highly recommend for anyone who suffers from the same ailment or anyone who is looking for a facial moisturizer that feels light and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great for acne prone skin&lt;br /&gt;Feels light, not greasy&lt;br /&gt;Feels natural&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates skin like no other&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey&lt;br /&gt;Meant for women&lt;br /&gt;Seems to require daily use or dry skin is noticeably worse</li>
    <li> Keeps face moisturizer. Goes on nice..not thick</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever! Winter left dryness on my face, tried many , must say Bare Minerals was the winner!</li>
    <li> Great product for dry, sensitive skin. This has a very luxurious feel when it&#x27;s applied and my skin stays moisturized all day despite the dryness of winter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that works for me in an extremely dry climate. Bare Minerals is free of all chemicals and harsh ingredients. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Product made my skin extremely greasy and shiny. I was completely  disappointed when I contacted customer service for a refund when I had used less than 1/4 of the container and they would do nothing for me.</li>
