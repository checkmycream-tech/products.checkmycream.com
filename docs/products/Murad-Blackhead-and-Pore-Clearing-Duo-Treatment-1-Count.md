<ol>
      <li>Very happy with purchase</li>
      <li>This product is great!</li>
      <li>Product is awesome!</li>
      <li>Yes very good product</li>
      <li>I thought this would be great</li>
      <li>Great duo.</li>
      <li>I purchase a lot of skin products but these have beem amazing!</li>
      <li>Good value as a set.</li>
      <li>Good product for some but not me.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this duo!</li>
      <li>I have had clogged pores on my nose for most of my life and nothing has worked for me...until now!</li>
      <li>I also bought ASDM and that did amazing things for my skin.</li>
      <li>pimples i lovingly deal with.  </li>
      <li>Thats a really nice product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how impressed I am with this duo and highly recommend it to anyone who has battled clogged pores.</li>
      <li>Broke me out more than anything</li>
      <li>and i have not had this many pimples since grade school.  </li>
      <li>and I have found better results.  </li>
      <li>I love the exfoliating mask.</li>
      <li>Works amazing, definitely worth the money</li>
      <li>I love both of those products and with my order I received a free sample of this duo -</li>
      <li>I have noticed, however, that these products have softened the whiteheads and allow for easy removal.</li>
      <li>I have seen a huge improvement in my blackheads and pore size but no reduction in the production of whiteheads.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price, I never want to be without it!</li>
      <li>Coupled with my T-Zone Pore Refining Serum by Murad, the regimen gives the best results I&#x27;ve ever had in maintaining clear and blackhead-free pores especially on the nose!</li>
      <li>purchased this at Nordstrom, so I was able to return it when I found that it did nothing positive for my skin.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this would work a lady told me it was a great product when I got my facial</li>
      <li>Luckily, i was given this as a gift, becuase i would never buy it again.  </li>
      <li>shipping was quick, love this product and makes my pores feel extra clean.</li>
      <li>so far I love everything I have tried of Murad&#x27;s  I started using the foaming wash with the T zone pore refining serum -</li>
      <li>I have like, 15 pimples right now</li>
      <li>really just like the way it makes my face feel when I&#x27;m done!</li>
      <li>I was going to buy the product at Massage Envy, but decided to look at Ulta first.  </li>
      <li>item shown is exactly as described on website.</li>
      <li>have enlarged pores on most of my face and they get clogged and dirty very easily, they are visible most of the time because of the dirt and oil that builds up</li>
      <li>Skin feels so clean and soft after using Murad pore reform duo.</li>
      <li>really like the product and feel like it does exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
      <li>I have chosen this as my main blackhead &amp; pore treatment!  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much......</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say much about the serum.</li>
      <li>then you put a squirt or two of the second bottle on your fingers and smooth it over your face.</li>
      <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t do anything to prevent the pores from clogging..</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to see the smoothness and clearing of the face.</li>
      <li>I used the product right away and noticed a marked improvement in the look of my pores immediately.</li>
      <li>then we are back to the original situation.  </li>
      <li>I used it for the 1st time last night and this morning my skin just looks absolutely amazing with much smaller pores - and extremely soft -</li>
      <li>Wow, I can see the difference in my pores have been using it about 1week, really  cleans the dirt from your pores.</li>
      <li>These work very well and do not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>However if you want to have long lasting result,  you have to make sure you use this product 2-3 times a week.</li>
      <li>The mask does have fragrance in it, which I don&#x27;t like, but I&#x27;ve smelled worse and the scent does not stay on your skin, so that is good.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this is the only thing working for me right now.  </li>
      <li>package was new and the stuff inside was new as well.</li>
      <li>does shrink pores and clear them out.</li>
      <li>I would leave it on for 10 minutes and had no trouble washing it off.  </li>
      <li>Not for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>but I have really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>My skin is baby soft when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and the longer timing doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.  </li>
      <li>as long as I leave it on for 10 minutes, it really works.. and the exfoliating granules aren&#x27;t too rough, so it refines nicely, but the sealer stuff is a total waste of money.. it feels like a pore clogger</li>
      <li>/&gt;It cleared up my mini-breakouts within 2 days and my pores actually get clean and are infinitely less visible than before.</li>
      <li>I expected those persistent blackheads on my nose and chin to be removed more deeply than just the surface bit of oil that turns black.  </li>
      <li>I understand completely that its taking the dirt out of your pores hence why i am breaking out, but honestly, it is not necessary.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to Murad but this product was used in a recent facial I got.  </li>
      <li>I had better results using slightly whipped raw egg white as a masque.</li>
      <li>Works as expected and keeps skin clear from breakouts.</li>

<li> I had better results using slightly whipped raw egg white as a masque.</li>
<li> Works as expected and keeps skin clear from breakouts.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a pretty thick cream and even if you use it sparingly it takes a while to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> I suppose if you blackheads are so incredibly terrible and you are willing to try anything you could give it a try, but for the normal person with normal pores who thinks &amp;#34;hm, maybe my skin can look better&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t really need it?  </li>
<li> have not really used it enough to comment on it.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t think it really does anything and its a very small bottle.</li>
<li> It smooths on a lot easier and might be why it takes longer to dry on my face.&lt;br</li>
<li> Did not work for my blackheads and even with trying to barely use just a bit still dried the areas I used it up</li>
<li> I tried some and my black heads stayed the same.</li>
<li> And the only thing this does is maybe make a few vanish for a couple days on my cheek around my nose</li>
<li> I was hoping this product would pull more of the oil out of my pores and ended up disappointed.</li>
<li> This product is not worth the price.  </li>
<li> I have enlarged, somewhat dark pores around my T-zone.  </li>
<li> maybe my blackheads are too black</li>
<li> , I would never buy it online, hope it helpful for the black heads</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other blackhead scrubs, masks, and exfoliants in the past and nothing has worked as well as these two products.</li>
<li> - I have seen a few reviews on here saying that it caused stinging and redness-</li>
<li> You smear the paste on trouble spots (or all over) let it sit for a minute or two then dampen your fingers and rub all over then rinse it off</li>
<li> All i am going to say is - don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  </li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this.....</li>
<li> The duo is not available in the UK</li>
<li> I received the pore reform blackhead &amp; pore clearing duo a few days ago.</li>
<li> The small jar is like a thick paste with little exfoliating scrubbies in it.</li>
<li> when I open up the package it shows I got it on another makeup website, I don&#x27;t know what should I say just feel weird...</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews on other sites where people complained that the mask was difficult to wash off.  </li>
<li> Used on my face and had massive peeling (chemical peel style peeling) and painful, burning skin.</li>
<li> when usually i have 1 or 2 random &amp;#34;time of the month&amp;#34;</li>
<li> In fact, it dried my nose to the point where my skin was pealing, now I have a lil scar on my nose. &#x3D;(</li>
<li> And I&#x27;M not sure is real or fake</li>
<li> -  caused by some very expensive skincare I had tried (</li>
<li> so bad</li>
<li> and I hate it...</li>
<li> My skin is very angry with me!</li>

    <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Luckily, i was given this as a gift, becuase i would never buy it again.  I was using it about twice a week for about 3 weeks and i have not had this many pimples since grade school.

My skin is very angry with me!</li>
    <li> Great duo. Works well to reduce the pores</li>
    <li> Nothing gets rid of my blackheads. I was born  with oily skin, it&#x27;s still oily but no wrinkles!! yeah!</li>
    <li> Yes very good product</li>
    <li> does shrink pores and clear them out.</li>
    <li> shipping was quick, love this product and makes my pores feel extra clean.</li>
    <li> This stuff dosen&#x27;t work at all! I tried some and my black heads stayed the same.</li>
    <li> I received the pore reform blackhead &amp; pore clearing duo a few days ago. I used the product right away and noticed a marked improvement in the look of my pores immediately. I have had clogged pores on my nose for most of my life and nothing has worked for me...until now! I can&#x27;t tell you how impressed I am with this duo and highly recommend it to anyone who has battled clogged pores. Well worth the price, I never want to be without it!</li>
    <li> Product did not work, no change in blackheads.  I used according to the directions.  I do not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my blackheads and even with trying to barely use just a bit still dried the areas I used it up so bad my actual skin peeled off. I was so looking forward to getting help without the dermatologist. This was my last hope.&lt;br /&gt;The package was new and the stuff inside was new as well. Good product for some but not me. Would buy from this seller again though. Not their fault my face didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I used this five times over the course of two weeks.  I have enlarged, somewhat dark pores around my T-zone.  This product did nothing to reduce their size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews on other sites where people complained that the mask was difficult to wash off.  I would leave it on for 10 minutes and had no trouble washing it off.  It gets creamy again once you splash water on your face.  The mask does have fragrance in it, which I don&#x27;t like, but I&#x27;ve smelled worse and the scent does not stay on your skin, so that is good.  The Pore Sealer does not have a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this at Nordstrom, so I was able to return it when I found that it did nothing positive for my skin.</li>
    <li> Dunno still using no big results maybe my blackheads are too black</li>
    <li> The duo is not available in the UK so I had to buy it on Amazon. Coupled with my T-Zone Pore Refining Serum by Murad, the regimen gives the best results I&#x27;ve ever had in maintaining clear and blackhead-free pores especially on the nose!</li>
    <li> I have chosen this as my main blackhead &amp; pore treatment!  I purchase a lot of skin products but these have beem amazing!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much...... I also bought ASDM and that did amazing things for my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this.....</li>
    <li> item shown is exactly as described on website. thank you</li>
    <li> Broke me out more than anything</li>
    <li> This product has not worked for me as of yet although I like Murad products.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. In fact, it dried my nose to the point where my skin was pealing, now I have a lil scar on my nose. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I thought this would be great but I have really sensitive skin and all it did was cause a rash and made me break out. It all cleared up after two weeks of non-use.</li>
    <li> No change after using</li>
    <li> Thats a really nice product. Skin feels so clean and soft after using Murad pore reform duo. It works well. However if you want to have long lasting result,  you have to make sure you use this product 2-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I like the mask.. as long as I leave it on for 10 minutes, it really works.. and the exfoliating granules aren&#x27;t too rough, so it refines nicely, but the sealer stuff is a total waste of money.. it feels like a pore clogger and it really doesn&#x27;t do anything to prevent the pores from clogging..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to Murad but this product was used in a recent facial I got.  I was going to buy the product at Massage Envy, but decided to look at Ulta first.  Then it hit me to look on Amazon and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper here.  If you&#x27;re going to try it, buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the product and feel like it does exactly what it claims to do.  My skin is baby soft when I&#x27;m done.  I do however break the rules and leave it on a lot longer than recommended.  It&#x27;s a pretty thick cream and even if you use it sparingly it takes a while to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.  I end up leaving it on for about 30 minutes and I have found better results.  I have sensitive skin and the longer timing doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.  It also doesn&#x27;t tell you to put it on &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; skin.  It smooths on a lot easier and might be why it takes longer to dry on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a variety of the Reform products so I don&#x27;t know if this is the only thing working for me right now.  It might be one of the others in combination with this, but I have found that my blackheads are reducing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really just like the way it makes my face feel when I&#x27;m done!</li>
    <li> I love the exfoliating mask. Can&#x27;t say much about the serum. Don&#x27;t think it really does anything and its a very small bottle.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would pull more of the oil out of my pores and ended up disappointed. I expected those persistent blackheads on my nose and chin to be removed more deeply than just the surface bit of oil that turns black.  Directions say to use it 3x a week. Using it once or twice a week works for about 24 hours then we are back to the original situation.  This product is not worth the price.  I had better results using slightly whipped raw egg white as a masque.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this duo! The small jar is like a thick paste with little exfoliating scrubbies in it. You smear the paste on trouble spots (or all over) let it sit for a minute or two then dampen your fingers and rub all over then rinse it off then you put a squirt or two of the second bottle on your fingers and smooth it over your face. That&#x27;s it, you are DONE.&lt;br /&gt;I have enlarged pores on most of my face and they get clogged and dirty very easily, they are visible most of the time because of the dirt and oil that builds up and I hate it...I have never found a face wash that eliminated that problem area until i used this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It cleared up my mini-breakouts within 2 days and my pores actually get clean and are infinitely less visible than before.</li>
    <li> have not really used it enough to comment on it. and would behappy to use it again and will order again</li>
    <li> Good value as a set. Works as expected and keeps skin clear from breakouts.</li>
    <li> so far I love everything I have tried of Murad&#x27;s  I started using the foaming wash with the T zone pore refining serum - I love both of those products and with my order I received a free sample of this duo - I used it for the 1st time last night and this morning my skin just looks absolutely amazing with much smaller pores - and extremely soft - so here I am ordering it.  - I don&#x27;t have acne and blackheads are a recent thing -  caused by some very expensive skincare I had tried ( different brand)  - I have seen a few reviews on here saying that it caused stinging and redness- I did not experience anything at all like that.</li>
    <li> when I open up the package it shows I got it on another makeup website, I don&#x27;t know what should I say just feel weird... And I&#x27;M not sure is real or fake cuz it&#x27;s different with the one I saw on CVS, if I know CVS has it, I would never buy it online, hope it helpful for the black heads</li>
    <li> Product is awesome! Works amazing, definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> Wow, I can see the difference in my pores have been using it about 1week, really  cleans the dirt from your pores.</li>
    <li> These work very well and do not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work a lady told me it was a great product when I got my facial and I&#x27;ve tried everything else so I thought maybe a more expensive product and since it was recommended I thought it would work BUT NO. I still have blackheads. And the only thing this does is maybe make a few vanish for a couple days on my cheek around my nose which is what the $5 mask from target does. My nose is still covered with no change. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if this is your last resort skip spending $30+ and go to target and get the store brand wash because thats all this does</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other blackhead scrubs, masks, and exfoliants in the past and nothing has worked as well as these two products. I have seen a huge improvement in my blackheads and pore size but no reduction in the production of whiteheads. I have noticed, however, that these products have softened the whiteheads and allow for easy removal. I am hopeful that with regular use the whiteheads will be removed as well.</li>
    <li> Not for sensitive skin.  Used on my face and had massive peeling (chemical peel style peeling) and painful, burning skin.</li>
    <li> Cleared my skin up in about a week, although pricey it does what it says</li>
    <li> This product is great! If you have blackheads or whiteheads, you will see a difference within two weeks. It doesn&#x27;t take much to see the smoothness and clearing of the face.</li>
