      <li>more!  </li>
      <li>I love these products!</li>
      <li>It allows a good coverage to give a smooth look.</li>
      <li>This product is light and at the same time has the perfect coverage for skin imperfections, leaving a very good finish with a very effective mineral loose powder.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>Skin get better, tone better won&#x27;t change for anything</li>
      <li>I love bareminerals</li>
      <li>what more can I say...</li>
      <li>It is the second time I buy this product and it perfectly alternates with my MAC Studio Fix - known for really great coverage - for hotter days in Brazil, where I live.</li>
      <li>Yet look flawless all day long.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like rigid regimes and I need to be able to use products quickly and this fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and has spf protection.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t love this as much, but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>This makeup is so light and clean that you can sleep in it.</li>
      <li>Love this product so much!</li>
      <li>I prefer the original line because I don&#x27;t like the shine</li>
      <li>This product is the full 8 grams.</li>
      <li>My first bare minerals purchase was the 6g container of fairly medium.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and the transaction was smooth.</li>
      <li>Then in the past year or so I tried it again, this time using a moisturizer type primer and it work beautifully.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
      <li>and I love even more that I can buy it on here for significantly less than in the store.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to apply and looks so natural.</li>
      <li>I like the Bareminerals line of cosmetics very much.  </li>
      <li>It was the exact size and color</li>
      <li>I would say if you have a lot of wrinkles though, try using a primer first.</li>
      <li>it is very light, and as I said above, the coverage is amazing without having to apply a ton of it, unlike the other brands.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way...be sure to use a good brush to apply it.</li>
      <li>But if you modify how you tap it into the cap and don&#x27;t get overly concerned about tapping the brush back into the cap, it does just fine.</li>
      <li>The seal was intact and shipping was fast.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>It seems to take twice as much to cover.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands, and none of them even come close to giving the coverage that Bare Minerals does.</li>
      <li>I have purchased bareminerals before, but this was a new color</li>
      <li>This one is much lighter in color and is a different texture.</li>
      <li>I am 69 and have very few wrinkles so bare minerals works fine for me.</li>
      <li>I noticed my last jar ran out fast and realized it was only 6 grams of powder.</li>
      <li>I have been using Bare Minerals for about 15 years.</li>
      <li>Will be buying my bare minerals here from now on.</li>

    <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for about 15 years.It is so easy to apply and looks so natural.If I&#x27;m too lazy to remove my makeup at night,I don&#x27;t worry about it.I am 69 and have very few wrinkles so bare minerals works fine for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use anythign else again. This makeup is so light and clean that you can sleep in it. Yet look flawless all day long.</li>
    <li> I love bareminerals and I love even more that I can buy it on here for significantly less than in the store. I just wish there were more prime options available to buy it, but over all great product and deal!</li>
    <li> This product is light and at the same time has the perfect coverage for skin imperfections, leaving a very good finish with a very effective mineral loose powder. It is the second time I buy this product and it perfectly alternates with my MAC Studio Fix - known for really great coverage - for hotter days in Brazil, where I live. I greatly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and has spf protection.  Looks good.</li>
    <li> Great price! Saves me $$$.</li>
    <li> It was the exact size and color I wanted.. And I got a great deal. Will be buying my bare minerals here from now on.</li>
    <li> I have purchased bareminerals before, but this was a new color and I really like it.  Would definitely buy it again,</li>
    <li> My first bare minerals purchase was the 6g container of fairly medium. Loved it. This one is much lighter in color and is a different texture. It seems to take twice as much to cover. Don&#x27;t love this as much, but it&#x27;s OK. I&#x27;ll look for the 6g container again. Not sure if this is really bare minerals, if I somehow got a different BM product, or if they&#x27;ve changed the formula.</li>
    <li> Excellent and a Good Price!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering at first but glad I did!  I saved about eight dollars buying from Amazon instead of the department store, plus I got 2g. more!  If you already know your color, this is the best deal I&#x27;ve found anywhere.  The seal was intact and shipping was fast.  I&#x27;m very pleased - who doesn&#x27;t need to save all they can these days?</li>
    <li> Again....what more can I say...I love these products! Have used them for over 10 years. They give the most flawless coverage that your canvas(face) will allow. It is a truly amazing product!</li>
    <li> Used this for years and it just works, over and over. Skin get better, tone better won&#x27;t change for anything</li>
    <li> Got immediately and was cheaper than I could&#x27;ve gotten from the store. Loved the convenience!</li>
    <li> Years ago I tried a &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; foundation but found it wouldn&#x27;t stay on. Then in the past year or so I tried it again, this time using a moisturizer type primer and it work beautifully. It allows a good coverage to give a smooth look. It does not look heavy nor &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;. This sized product lasts me approximately 2 months and I use it every day. I&#x27;ve read reviews that states that it is messy to use, and it can be. But if you modify how you tap it into the cap and don&#x27;t get overly concerned about tapping the brush back into the cap, it does just fine. If you have spots on your skin you want to cover, I use a small concealer brush to apply it first then the big brush to do the overall area. I don&#x27;t like rigid regimes and I need to be able to use products quickly and this fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;You may need to experiment with color, the  first one I used was a little dark but one shade lighter was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for every skin-type.</li>
    <li> I like the Bareminerals line of cosmetics very much.  I prefer the original line because I don&#x27;t like the shine the newer line gives you as it makes your skin look like you are sweating.</li>
    <li> Smooth application, great coverage, nice color match!! I have finally found THE product to help me &amp;#34;age gracefully&amp;#34;. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this face powder! I noticed my last jar ran out fast and realized it was only 6 grams of powder. This product is the full 8 grams. Shipping was fast and the transaction was smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much! Great deal and I would recommend this to anyone who has never tried it! Love!</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation around...I have tried many different brands, and none of them even come close to giving the coverage that Bare Minerals does. You never feel like you have to wash your face and get that stuff off...it is very light, and as I said above, the coverage is amazing without having to apply a ton of it, unlike the other brands. A little goes a long way...be sure to use a good brush to apply it. It stays on, even if you swim. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I look younger just after putting it on plus it last for a long time!  I love this make up line!  I would say if you have a lot of wrinkles though, try using a primer first.</li>
