### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>Best pill splitter out there.</li>
      <li>This is a great pill splitter!</li>
      <li>This is the best pill splitter I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>This is a brilliantly engineered product.</li>
      <li>Great value for two.</li>
      <li>Works great...</li>
      <li>The pill splitter does a good job of splitting pills.</li>
      <li>Each pill requires you to learn its own &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Great and clean tool to split pills</li>
      <li>Need I say more?</li>
      <li>Looking for a better solution.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>This pill splitter is better than most.</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>They make a precise cut every time, regardless of shape or size of pill.</li>
      <li>It never smashes the pills but always cuts cleanly.</li>
      <li>1 step higher than the really cheap ones.  </li>
      <li>but I was able to put it back together for now.</li>
      <li>Good on small pills.</li>
      <li>My husband uses it very day, once in the morning and once at night.</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that it will not stay open on its own once that plastic strip is removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really small pills (1/8 inch diameter) can be challenging to line up for an even split and coated pills sometime hang together after being split because the doesn&#x27;t press all the way to the rubberized surface thereby not cutting through the coating on the bottom side of the pill.</li>
      <li>Just clean it VERY CAREFULLY  after each day’s use.</li>
      <li>It is not designed to be maintained forever - the blade will dull, the plastic parts may eventually break, but it is cheap enough to be worth replacing when it wears out.</li>
      <li>And all the convience at such a reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>, the cut is precise and the device is really safe since the cutting blade is covered when the tool is open.</li>

<li> Really, quite simple to maintain, a simple product to get a satisfactory result that could otherwise be frustrating.</li>
<li> We will see how long it lasts</li>
<li> Big pain to then only give half a pill when it isn&#x27;t cut in half.</li>
<li> It holds the pill firmly, cuts in cleanly into two equal halves and has a an automatically retracting plastic barrier that protects your finger from the cutting blade until the cutter is closed.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Performance: Temper your expectations in reality... Some pills are less dense or less firmly compressed and these will splinter and/or crumble irregardless of the splitter you choose.</li>
<li> this little cutie will cut them into 4 parts with two chops.</li>
<li> For my 92 year old mom with very weak, arthritic hands.  </li>
<li> I already have one and needed a few extras</li>
<li> The leaver creaks when you lower it and jerks the pill from the center point as you are cutting it making very uneven cuts.</li>
<li> For cutting pills with a small knife on a cutting board is not the way to go!</li>
<li> Very poor quality and it crushes the pills instead of cutting them</li>
<li> but maybe I got some bad ones.</li>

    <li> The leaver creaks when you lower it and jerks the pill from the center point as you are cutting it making very uneven cuts. Big pain to then only give half a pill when it isn&#x27;t cut in half. Looking for a better solution.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement to one that I bought at CVS Drug Store that broke after several years of use.&lt;br /&gt;This one works so hard that my wife can&#x27;t really use it. So now I have to cut her pills and mine.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Great value for two.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and comparing this to others I bought two. It works well but I recommend removing the blade guard. The cutting precision and efficiency is much greater without that piece of plastic in the way. The only drawback is that it will not stay open on its own once that plastic strip is removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: Temper your expectations in reality... Some pills are less dense or less firmly compressed and these will splinter and/or crumble irregardless of the splitter you choose. Really small pills (1/8 inch diameter) can be challenging to line up for an even split and coated pills sometime hang together after being split because the doesn&#x27;t press all the way to the rubberized surface thereby not cutting through the coating on the bottom side of the pill. Each pill requires you to learn its own &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34;. I see this as pill related, not splitter related. I feel I can wholeheartedly recommend this product, with the above in mind.</li>
    <li> This pill splitter is better than most. My husband uses it very day, once in the morning and once at night. Just clean it VERY CAREFULLY  after each day’s use. Really, quite simple to maintain, a simple product to get a satisfactory result that could otherwise be frustrating. For cutting pills with a small knife on a cutting board is not the way to go! And all the convience at such a reasonable cost. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality and it crushes the pills instead of cutting them</li>
    <li> Great and clean tool to split pills, the cut is precise and the device is really safe since the cutting blade is covered when the tool is open.</li>
    <li> I already have one and needed a few extras</li>
    <li> This is a great pill splitter!</li>
    <li> Best pill splitter out there.</li>
    <li> The piece of plastic that protected fingers from the blade broke after being used twice. The pill splitter does a good job of splitting pills.</li>
    <li> For my 92 year old mom with very weak, arthritic hands.  She can use it.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Good on small pills. Not so much on larger pills. One splitter broke but I was able to put it back together for now. I like the design but maybe I got some bad ones.</li>
    <li> So the prescription cost of 100mg pills is the same as 50mg pills but you only need 25mg... this little cutie will cut them into 4 parts with two chops.</li>
    <li> These pill cutters are for WildCat Sanctuary. They work well and I appreciate it.</li>
    <li> 1 step higher than the really cheap ones.  We will see how long it lasts</li>
    <li> These pill cutters, though made of plastic, feel and perform as if they were made of surgical steel. They make a precise cut every time, regardless of shape or size of pill. MADE IN USA. Need I say more? Buy with confidence! - a.c. in ND</li>
    <li> Of the 2 pill cutters rcvd, one was damaged and didnot cut.</li>
    <li> This is a brilliantly engineered product. It holds the pill firmly, cuts in cleanly into two equal halves and has a an automatically retracting plastic barrier that protects your finger from the cutting blade until the cutter is closed.  It is not designed to be maintained forever - the blade will dull, the plastic parts may eventually break, but it is cheap enough to be worth replacing when it wears out.</li>
    <li> This is the best pill splitter I&#x27;ve ever used.  I got two so I&#x27;d have an extra.  It never smashes the pills but always cuts cleanly.</li>
    <li> Works great...Love it</li>
