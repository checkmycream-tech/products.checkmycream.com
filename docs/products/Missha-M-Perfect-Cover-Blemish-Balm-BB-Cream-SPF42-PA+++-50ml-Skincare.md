<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK product... it is greasy and does not last long. I do not think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I just received my missha bb cream today and I was so amazed wit the shipping. I ordered it on the 4th of july around 9pm and was shipped when I woke up the next morning. I reveived it 4days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, its a great bb cream, although the shade is slightly a bit light but if I wait 2 hours for it to settle in, it looks good, its just ppl can tell I&#x27;m wearing some kind of tint on my face just because its slightly a bit lighter on my skin but its workable. I tried putting a little bit of foundation loose powder n it didn&#x27;t work that well, but i put the MAC blot powder and it looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered #27 through Misshaus.com 2 Saturday&#x27;s ago and they STILL haven&#x27;t shipped it. But I think the #27 will fit me better.  I dnt have a tan as I&#x27;m trying to avoid color change to my face because I ordered the darker shade of bb cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, it&#x27;s moisturizing, I think ppl who have little patches of dry areas to the face should put a little moisturizer on and wait a few minutes before applying the bb cream. It was well worth paying for. I think I might mix the 2 #&#x27;s when I get the other shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big thanks to the seller, it made my day, just the fact it came a few days before their approximate delivery day</li>
    <li> It goes on so easily and blends in so quickly.  It is a wonderful makeup and it does last all day!  I just use a light powder for touch ups.</li>
    <li> The color turned out a little darker than I had anticipated, but I can&#x27;t really fault anyone for that; it&#x27;s very difficult to judge what color will match your skin based on the color samples on the computer screen.  Even with it being a bit darker, it blends in very nicely and honestly looks just fine on my face.  It does a good job of giving coverage like a foundation without feeling heavy, cakey, or oily.  It feels very moisturizing, which is nice.</li>
    <li> Hello everybody.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product because I&#x27;m trying to match the color of my skin, I&#x27;m a latina and as you may know we have complex or different color of skin between tan and cinnamon, so hopefully they made one just for us. I&#x27;ve been using this product have nice fragrance and do covers your imperfections.</li>
    <li> I got it in a timely manner.  but i love this product, a little does go a long way and for tinted moisturizer, very pigmented and light!</li>
    <li> i like the coverage but it makes me break out, is a good product and it last all day but it did not work for me</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get this if you&#x27;re looking for the authentic Missha BB cream! There are small hints on the packaging that indicate this is a fake. I had done my research and had compared it to the real one.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when my order came in! The consistency is light-medium and has a nice finish. I got my product when it was still in the middle of winter and since I have normal to dry skin during that season I have flaky dry skin (eww I know!) I would use one pump mix it with a moisturizer and apply it to my face. I could tell that it helped with my blemish and brighten my face. The down fall for me was that it was a lighter shade for my skin tone, I&#x27;m a NC42, but you have to blend it really well to semi-match your shade. Naturally it will oxidize (turn a bit dark) and will match you skin. I use this every day and get complements on my skin (o///o) I recommend my friends about the Missha M Perfect Cover B.B Cream since it has many benefits ^____^</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice bb cream for morning routine. But it won&#x27;t last all day. The color is a little dark for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister who read a lot of articles online that hyped this product up.  We&#x27;re east Asian and the BB cream seems to be a decent concealer.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as amazing as all the hype surrounding this product describes it as.  If the price is right, give it a try yourself although I am afraid of fake products being sold online.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply with hands after you use daily facial cream, smell nice, skin looks natural and good after use it, and it is lighter than regular liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;The color is just a little bit too dark, maybe should choose 21 instead.</li>
    <li> Got this product a few days ago (very speedy delivery from this seller), and I have to say I&#x27;m quite impressed with the coverage. Leaves my skin looking like porcelain! Granted, my skin was already pretty smooth, but this cream made it look flawless. I knocked off one star bc 1. I really hate the smell (reminds me of baby powder x10) and 2. the finish was a bit shiny. I didn&#x27;t mind the latter too much, as I have dry/combination skin, but those with oily skin should definitely set this with a matte powder. Also, keep in mind that though BB creams have good coverage, they are by no means on the same level as full coverage foundations. Thus, I would still use concealer over this to cover my blemishes. All in all, a good quality buy for less than $20, and I recommend getting it from this source.    [Edit 1/10/11]    I initially gave this product four stars but had to reassess after noticing an unflattering white/grayish cast on my skin (I&#x27;m Asian American, NC25-30). I was shocked to see how much it had oxidized! The smell is also really getting to me. Hate this.</li>
    <li> If you continuously use this BB cream for 3 days, your skin will become dull,even using the best make up remover to remove it. If you have other choice try to stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the coverage that I like.  I don&#x27;t really like the smell...it smells like Nair hair removal products.  On the good side, it does feel light! However, I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Nothing compares to it  Tried many other BB creams and I love this one</li>
    <li> I have tried several BB creams and this is the best ever.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on so easily and the coverage is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Product is good for the price. It can provide full coverage if layered. Tends to be too light a shade for people with more of an olive-toned complexion.</li>
    <li> The product itself is decent, but the smell is incredible. I just wish the lasting needs to stay longer. Beside that, that product is great!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a BB cream for the longest time. I decided to choose Missha because i&#x27;ve heard many rave reviews. I&#x27;m asian with yellow toned skin. I also suffer from occasional break outs and have acne scars on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve been using Everyday Minerals which I think is a great brand but I did not like the feel of it at the end of the day; felt like mud on your face. So when i received my order in #23 I tried it out and surprisingly it blended really well into my skin color. I swatched it previously on my hand and it was almost like a taupe color that didn&#x27;t look like it would fit me. The smell is..interesting. People love the smell but I feel like it&#x27;s too \\&quot;perfume-y\\&quot;; it may smell like johnson&#x27;s baby oil to you but it&#x27;s too strong and \\&quot;feminine\\&quot;. The texture is creamy but not in a thick sense. It looks thick but feels smooth. There is a dewy effect that I think most people will like but for myself, being oily, I decided to set it with a mineral powder afterwards.     I give it a 4/5 because when the shipment came, the box it came in (not the bulky package, like the actual box for the product) was damaged and there were sticky hand prints all over. I almost felt like it was used/touched a lot before sent. The product itself looked decent enough and nothing seemed to have squirted out of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of months ago, and finished the bottle. When I reordered, I went through Missha&#x27;s official US site and noticed that the two containers are not exactly the same, leading me to believe that I purchased a fake product from this seller. The fake stuff from Honest Skin isn&#x27;t the worst makeup I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin, but it isn&#x27;t as nice as the real product. Already after 3 days of using the real Missha BB cream, my acne is less and my skin is overall clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some differences in the fake bottle verses the real bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Fake: The red part of the plastic bottle is more shiny or glossy&lt;br /&gt;*Real: The red part of the plastic bottle has more of a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Fake: On the silver part of the pump, the injection molding seam can be seen.&lt;br /&gt;*Real: Seam cannot be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*There are also some differences in the words and format of the back of the bottle, which I will try to post a picture of.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical at first upon reading all the great reviews of this so called newly discovered product, called bb cream, but figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.     It&#x27;s been about a week since I&#x27;ve started using this cream (not daily, but most days), and I noticed my skin tone appears to be a lot more even and pleasant to look at on days when I do wear it. I have some pretty large pores, and it seems to help with covering them up as well. I&#x27;ve got scattered sun spots at the tip of my cheekbones and this cream provides pretty good coverage; not complete coverage though, but definitely moderate coverage, enough to say if I&#x27;m sitting face to face with another person, they would have to really be up close to me to see my sun spots.     I like how light weight it feels on my skin; I have combination skin, so around noon time I get pretty oily; this cream doesn&#x27;t prevent the oiliness, so I still have to blot towards mid-day, but the amount that comes off on the tissue is definitely not as heavy as when I wear liquid foundation;     Washing is also pretty easy; with foundation, I noticed each time I was at the end of the day I would see a TON of makeup come off on the wet wipe, but with this, it&#x27;s very light;     Overall, I really like this cream and will continue to use it in place of regular liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> goes on smooth, finishes matte, keeps my face from drying out in the winter, great base for other make up - almost like a primer. my only con is that I can only use it in the winter because even the darkest shade is still too light for my summer complexion.</li>
    <li> I have tried a handful of other BB creams and this is by far and away the best I have ever used. I highly recommend it. Great coverage without feeling like a mask.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to order my BB cream on Amazon.  However, this seller put an imitation product in the Missha container.  I have the authentic item with me to compare: completely different hue, consistency, and scent.  This stuff just flakes on the skin and is awful.  Who knows what product they filled the bottle with.  Also, I noticed that the top twists off, which is impossible with the real product.  Do not purchase this.</li>
    <li> Very good coverage, I thought 23 natural beige would be light but it was dark to my skin, and it looked gray. I still like it though.</li>
    <li> I used to use this BB cream a few years ago and had gotten away from it.  After trying several different and higher priced foundations and being disappointed, I broke down and bought another tube.  Now I know why I loved it.  Easy to use, full coverage, makes my skin look perfect AND has everything my skin needs.  At night I use a mineral powder over it to cut down on the &amp;#34;dewy-ness&amp;#34; but during the day, it&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;ve bought 2 colors the 21 and the 23 and alternate them, mix them, or use the lighter shade as a concealer.  Wonderful product</li>
    <li> if you oredrer this item from out of US,&lt;br /&gt;you will not recivite ,because its not allowd to import</li>
    <li> Content colour and packaging look nice. I haven&#x27;t used it as I am stuck in a very cold weather. Hopefully, I will use it next month.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with BB creams and since I found Missha, I don&#x27;t need to shop for any other. I use this under my foundations (the #23) and I love the brightening it provides. Your skin looks like it is glowing from within. Also, I swear my skin has improved in texture since starting with this cream. I apply it by patting it into my skin. I am medium, yellow toned and have tried the #27 and don&#x27;t like it as much even though it is more yellow. I WANT the whitening of the #23. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for coverage ranging from the high end $$$ to low.  So far I have tried the Dior BB to the Maybelline BB cream.  I was unsatisfied with the products.  For your average skin without flaws, these may work, but for skin types with issues don&#x27;t waste your time or $.  I have fair skin with dark spots on my cheeks.  This Missha M helps cover.  After using this people have commented on how clear my skin was.  The only thing is, since I have really dark spots, I mix this with a darker tone makeup to give me a bit more coverage. The coverage does last all day.  A bit oily, but I do not break out.</li>
    <li> Color is too dark for my skin. The product itself is probably not bad but I gave it 2 star because i hate the color that made my face looks dark.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect bb cream/foundation in one....and I have tried alot of them...not anymore, found the one for me :-) this one is my winter color !!!</li>
    <li> Love it, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone with oily skin I have relatively dry skin, and this product makes my face oil up. I make sure I have  Blotting sheets on me at all times.😁😀</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that this BB cream gives great coverage. It matched well with me light beige skin tone and pictures turned out fantastic. My skin did look very dewy. The problem is that this product didn&#x27;t seem to match well with my skin type. I have dry-combination skin, so I wanted something with more moisture. I read reviews that this type of BB cream is on the oily side. However, this ended up feeling too greasy and heavy. My skin is also very sensitive, so after a couple of days of regular use, I broke out along my cheek and chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: great coverage, dewy skin, long lasting (no problems with a full day out), color match, light scent, good packaging&lt;br /&gt;Cons: broke me out, greasy, heavy, felt more like foundation - especially when I was trying to take it off at night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I personally did not like this type of BB cream. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of types over the years, and I usually like Korean brands. I will be sticking with my Dr. Jart labels since it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as much.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but i would like a lighter look, which i order the wrong 1 and i would like some different suggestion cream that is more lighter and more shiny.</li>
    <li> This is a good ! It meets my needs and expectation ! I will need to some more  soon .</li>
    <li> Feels good on skin and goes on smooth but color way too light (more like ivory).&lt;br /&gt;OK everyday wear, lol!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one. I used #21 and #27 before, and I decided to go with #23. I am from Korea and #23 fits perfect for my skin color. I use it on weekdays when I go to work.  I am so glad Amazon sells this product.  I will buy it again and again.  Plus, Amazon sells this much cheaper than in Korea. It&#x27;s about $30 or so in Korea.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th tube of this.  great coverage and not greasy</li>
    <li> Great cover for a bb cream, I really liked this product, second time that I bought it.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional. I have used several BB creams but none this good. The product brightens your skin. The coverage is good. I used it after laser treatments at the dermatologist. I would recommend it to women with redness problems.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. it made me ditch all my other make-up products. it evened out my skin tone, hides my reds, and feels really light. it is nice that it has SPF in it already. i do still put on a light translucent powder on after... i just personally don&#x27;t like the dewy look.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The color appear light gray, but upon application the gray is very much subdue.  However, if you heavily apply the product the gray hue may be more pronounce.  For my complexion (light beige) it still looks great with heavy/light application.  Also, be warned that there is a fragrant which I like (my skin is sensitive); it doesn&#x27;t cause me any irritation.  For super-sensitive skin, however, fragrant may be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this cream, feels really smooth not cakey.  Works much better than I&#x27;ve anticipated.</li>
    <li> Very effective SPF. Blocks sunlight and cover blemish well. Smells super good. I like the scent. Stay long too whole day.</li>
    <li> Okey, before applying this I make sure to clean my face and everything. I putting on and it was too cakey and it didn&#x27;t blend well so I had to get more product. Didnt notice any difference.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! I&#x27;m not sure about the whitening part of it (although I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks and don&#x27;t have many spots or acne scars) but coverage-wise, it is great. It evens out my skin tone and makes me look awake. It goes on very smoothly and stays there all day like a foundation should! Definitely repurchasing.</li>
    <li> The color is great and so is the consistency.  I haven&#x27;t yet found that it accomplishes the brightening of my skin and reduction of dark spots but I&#x27;ve only had it one week.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the whitening properties or ingredients. its irritates my skin</li>
    <li> It is a bit sticky for me, but this is a good product. I should have bought a lighter color one. This was a little too dark for my skin.</li>
    <li> GREAT coverage and feels really light on the skin. I recommend this to many people and also the natural beige matched my Asian skin tone.</li>
    <li> Is perfect for me, I use every day and I don&#x27;t find nothing better, I really liked this product for my friends!</li>
    <li> The item was perfectly described by the seller but just a fair warning that it has an off-putting smell that I don&#x27;t like. Overall good coverage though.</li>
    <li> I really like this bb cream.i have sensitive and dry skin  before bb cream I apply moisture so I have had no problem with this bb cream.Also shipping is very fast.</li>
    <li> The BB cream is super light and feels great on!  I was apprehensive about purchasing the product before testing it but the color blended very well with my skin tone.  I have somewhat dehydrated skin so the product does flake a bit for me, but I don&#x27;t know if that is a product issue or just my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item also came very fast.  The shipping estimated 2-3 weeks for delivery but I got it within a week!</li>
    <li> Beauty junkie had to have this! Love this-my daughter stole it from me! Good coverage. Nice color!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product.  After using for about a month, my skin is smoother and more clear.  I love that it covers without being heavy on the skin.  I am 50 now... and less is more at my age.  I want nothing cakey on my skin.  I just ordered my second tube.</li>
    <li> Good coverage and perfect if you want  to have dewy skin look.Really happy with Missha M BB cream. well recommend</li>
    <li> Gives a clean finish. High SPF against UV light. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
    <li> Great product - caters to Asian skin.  I like how it blends quickly to my skin color and does not make my face oily after hours of application.  It doesn&#x27;t look pasty after applying face powder rather looks very natural!  I love it so much that I am thinking about buying from this seller again when I run out!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> When I use the cream for the first time I discovered that the color Natural Beige was too light.  I contacted the seller to return it but never got the response, so I use other darker make up to darken the cream.  Now I use it everyday and love the results for its smooth texture.  My skin looks flawless.  I wish it comes with more color options.  It&#x27;s incovenient to have to use two products and mixing science.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped in a very reasonable time ( to Canada ).  The Missha M Perfect Cover is such an amazing BB Cream.  The coverage is very good, blends wells, wears for the whole day without breaking down.  Upon application it can be a little light, even greyish, but in minutes oxidizes to match my skin NC25 perfectly.</li>
    <li> Good coverage, Great price, but doesn&#x27;t last all day. Still recommend it though.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream, is one of the best i believe that i have used. This BB cream does a good job with covering my acne, and i love the SPF is 45 which I don&#x27;t have to wear sunscreen. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got psoriatic arthritis and along with it came skin psoriasis. This coverage works and is not drying like other makeups. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this products for me, and it&#x27;s smooth. When applied, it is too thick for me. Also, for Asian girls, we may need a lighter color</li>
    <li> This product truly lived up to my demands and expectations. Beginning with the ease of ordering and clear and concise discription of this product and ending with the prompt delivery.  The product itself truly provides the coverage that I needed as well as nourishing my skin.  This product is perfect for use during those hot sweltering summer days when a heavy liquid foundation just will not do. On the days when I am running late a little BB cream and a light powder or blush will go along way.  My daughter who has outbreaks of acne has also begun to use this product and has commented to me how satisfied she is with this product.</li>
    <li> It does good. But it seems to be a little more white when I use it. Maybe I need to adjust it in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this product so very much.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a complete cover up without the heaviness of a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Missha M Perfect Cover BB cream in 23 for years, and I&#x27;ve been pretty loyal to it until I noticed it might be drying out my lips. I like the coverage, color, texture, scent, and overall performance of this bb cream. I think no.23 matches me perfectly. I also love the fact it has higher spf for someone like me who keeps forgetting sunblock. It can be a little bit oily and sliding off by mid-day. I don&#x27;t like to set my face with powder so it&#x27;s not good for me to wear this in the summer. I like to wear it in the Fall, Winter, and early Spring though. I think the larger size is great, and I also keep the smaller size in my travel bag. I love that it has a pump for easy access. I find squeezable tubes can be really annoying especially when its filled with some air and you can never get all the products out completely. By having a pump makes this less wasteful, and a 30ml tube can last me for more than a year for everyday use except for Summer. Then I noticed my lips get severely chapped and dry, and I tried every single lip therapy but nothing worked. I don&#x27;t notice it in the Summer when I&#x27;m not using this bb cream so I decided to stop using it whenever my lips get super dry. I realized the bb cream is causing the dryness in my lips, so I stopped using Missha ever since. Now I am using the Holika Holika clearing bb cream with spf30, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips at all. It&#x27;s also cheaper than Missha since I bought it on ebay. I still love Missha bb cream, and I still believe it&#x27;s the best of the best BB cream out there. It beats all western brand bb creams, and is certainly among the top Korean ones(I haven&#x27;t tried many other Korean brand bb creams since there are so many!). I think I will give it a go again and see if it still drys out lips. If it keeps doing that, I will just have to replace it for good.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product as it takes to open and my sorpesa was, it was a false product was opened, which was less than the amount the actual content. I demand a rerun of a new and original.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. It easily blends into the skin. It&#x27;s very soft and smooth. I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait for a while to see if i really like this BB cream. I purchased it about a month ago and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s making my skin oily or anything and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize so my skin tone does not look darker at the end of the day. I have a combination/sensitive skin type and it works perfectly. I love how the packaging is too; I like how it&#x27;s in a tube so I would be able to use every single bit of it. I also like how it comes in different shades, and this shade was perfect for my medium/natural skin tone. I currently use bobby brown&#x27;s powder in warm natural, and this color is perfect for my skin. on top of it use laura mercier&#x27;s loose setting powder or my bobby brown powder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a buildable sheer/medium coverage. It does reduce the redness of my acne and my dark circle around my eyes. I usually just use my concealer if i need more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other brands such as; Dr. Jart, skin 78, sarah macnamara, bobby brown, garnier, etc. I&#x27;ve tried more, and this brand is definitely one of my favorite. The quality is comparable with bobby brown. I am not a fan of Dr. Jart and skin 78, those made my skin oily at the end of the day, and it oxidizes really bad on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this brand, and I will continually use it.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews about this brand before trying it. It&#x27;s very thick &amp; pasty. Also the tint of the color is way off for me (I&#x27;m caucasian with an olive skin tone). I even tried mixing it with another foundation to get the tint right &amp; still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This BB cream makes a perfect cover for your face. I have tried out many different branches like The Face Shop, Holika Holika, Etude House, Tony Moly,... But I recommend this one as it leaves your skin a smooth and silky surface even after you wash out all the cream. I even dont have to say this, it has SPF 42 PA +++, congrats! Your skin has a superman protecting all day long.</li>
    <li> It made my face breakout. Also, the color didn&#x27;t match my skin perfectly; there was a grey tint to it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and immediately knew it was fake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product before and have gone through 2 tubes. The consistency i got was thick, heavy, and never absorbed. The color never adjusted and stayed pale on my skin, i looked like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever buying foreign products, be sure to double check which buyer it comes from or you might risk getting an expired or fake product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon: please do a better job on the sale of counterfeit goods</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a full coverage bb cream!  My sister just loved it. She uses it to cover up her dark circles.  I&#x27;m amazed how well it covers the darkness.  This purchase was originally for me but I&#x27;m glad it worked wonders for her.</li>
    <li> Has a gel consistence, good for the solid coverage</li>
    <li> It does cover very well and is very moist and comfortable on the face.  But I don&#x27;t about the self adjusting color.  It does shift a bit after 20 minutes or so, but not a great match.  Still looks a little too pinkish white (too cool for my complexion).  Which is okay now since I often wear a turtleneck or scarf due to the weather, but I doubt I will use it when I show my neck.</li>
    <li> There is no BB cream that has compared to this....quick and easy to use...I use it daily when I don&#x27;t want to put on makeup, and it makes my 47 year old skin look healthy, and glowing.  Nice light to medium coverage, and if you want full, apply a mineral makeup on top....all of the expensive &amp;#34;western&amp;#34; BB creams don&#x27;t even come close, and cost 3-4 times as much.  It also has a nice selection of colors, which alot don&#x27;t.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you should!- Oh and also, unlike most of the American ones, this does not have that nasty sunscreen smell.....</li>
    <li> I am an Asian girl with combination skin. my skin is problematic, big pores, acne sometimes... This BB cream covers everything, yet it does not feel heavy or oily like a foundation would be. The best thing is the idea that unlike other make up products that would harm you skin, it moisturize your skin while wearing it!!!&lt;br /&gt;my skin color is typical asian type, I wear giorgio armani foundation #4, and the color just blend in so perfectly, not too white or too dark. Hope it helps you choose your color</li>
    <li> Have used two tubes already ... easy to apply, not overly made up, and looks decent enough :-)</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a Korean BB cream as I have read they are more beneficial than American BB creams. However, I wasn&#x27;t sure of the coloring or if I would like it so I thought I would buy from Amazon since it was half the price. I originally bought #21 but it was too light for me. This one is better and blends well while providing more color. I absolutely love the coverage on this product. It is heavier than tinted moisturizer and covers like a lightweight foundation. When I first started using it it seem to last longer throughout the day and didn&#x27;t make my face oily (I have combo normal/dry skin due to acne regimen). However, my forehead has gotten very oily and even when using primer and powder the product seems to not last long enough throughout the day. I may try without moisturizer to see if it helps but I definitely have to use a primer to make it looks flawless throughout the day. I am also not happy it contains parabens. I will try the hypoallergenic version instead. Also I found out the date stamped on the bottle is not the expiry date but the manufacture date! As long as it is within 12 months you should be good to go!</li>
    <li> Love the cover this gives to my fragile skin.  I have rosacea and this is a great way to give my face a smooth appearance.  So easy to just put this Missha BB on and nothing else!  I do dab a little extra on my very rosy cheeks.  Lasts all day and just the right amount of moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this BB cream, but I am a bit disappointed. Firstly, the smell was much stronger than I expected. To me, it smelled like cheap perfume, which I really can&#x27;t stand the smell of. The color was not bad for my skin tone suprisingly - on my hand it looked too dark, but it wasn&#x27;t a bad match when I put it on. I read a lot of reviews about a greyish tone, and I would have to agree somewhat. I have reddish brown hair with a pale olive skintone (though I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m exceptionally pale like some people) and #23 is barely a touch too dark, but I didn&#x27;t seem to get too much of the grey cast after it settled on my skin. It didn&#x27;t seem to cover my blemishes particularly well, which is the major disappointment. I might try a lighter shade of this in the future, but more likely another product altogether.</li>
    <li> i have a lot of korean friends and i do believe korea is one of the best country for selling the makeup product. Missha gaves me a pretty good result and i do like it&#x27;s decent smell, which i wasn&#x27;t expected. Just i have a mild sensitive skin and easy to get oily after a long day, it caused me some break-out but not too serious.(which leads to the importance of removing your makeup everyday!) just the lightly grey color of it doesn&#x27;t lead to the happy ending. i always use some powder foundation to even out the skin tone and let my face not too shiny (which is more like an oily look). overall, it&#x27;s not too bad and probably recommend to my friend.</li>
    <li> Oh wow I wish I had listened to the other reviews. I don&#x27;t have a good sense of smell due to my sinuses but wow the scent of the cream is very overpowering. I feel this performs as well as the Skin79 brand but I honestly cannot give an accurate review as I only used this product once and have not touched it again as the scent has discouraged me.</li>
    <li> I found out AFTER I received this product that it contains parabens and more junky chemicals. 2nd ingredient is Mineral oil!!! I thought every beauty brands stopped using that in the 90&#x27;s yuk. On the plus side it has great coverage. It&#x27;s more like a foundation!&lt;br /&gt;I will be giving this away, because it&#x27;s greasy and has no healthy nourishing ingredients.</li>
    <li> The BB cream has good coverage and you only have you only have to use a little for your whole face.</li>
    <li> My mother and I have been using this for about a year and could not be happier with this product. We both suffer from different skin conditions and this B.B. Cream conceals and protects our skin wonderfully. It gives a natural even look and we are constantly getting compliments on our skin. I def recommend it! :)</li>
    <li> Great coverage and it doesn&#x27;t  irritate my skin. Lasts all day!! Will definitely purchase again!! Wish we had a store here!</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream, it covers your imperfections and leaves your skin beautiful all day. I love it even more for its protection against the sun (37).</li>
    <li> This BB cream was fairly decent. It provides sheer coverage and is excellent under heavier foundation.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that it&#x27;s a lot lighter than I expected, so it washes out my olive skin. Also the bb cream contains a mild skin lightening formula, which is nice if you want to help even your skin tone. But the pump applicator has led to spills that bleached a shirt or two.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to know that this cream is good for my skin (spf) as well as providing good coverage, however I wish it wasn&#x27;t such a grey tone. I&#x27;m yellow tone however I managed to have the cream match my skin .. it just feels a little off somehow. However it does smell good and I have no problem with it.</li>
    <li> All American BB creams do not compare to ths brand. This is was at a fair price for BB creams (about $17). It is a little higher than a drugstore BB cream, but less than a high end BB cream, which also suck. When I first tried this product the BB cream came out way too white but when I applied it and than set it with powder it looked like my skin! I have medium, Asian skin and the natural beige matches perfectly. It is a great product for the days you are too lazy to put a bunch of product on your face. My skin also looks better now that I started using this stuff. A bottle has lasted me about 2 months.</li>
    <li> When reading the reviews I assumed it was a thicker consistency and therefore provided more coverage, howeve, I found it to be very liquidy and not as matte as I would like.  Still in search of the perfect BB cream!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 years now and it never failed my expectations. It suits my skintone well and just appropriate for my dry skin as it gives an oily feel after application. I don&#x27;t even use any base or concealer on my face. I use this product singly as concealer, base, and moisturizer. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several BB creams over time and had always heard about Missha M Perfect Cover, but for some reason thought it was tailored for lovely ladies with older experienced skin so to say. I was so wrong! I&#x27;m 26 years old and have very good skin to start off with, but I do like to feed my \\&quot;vanity\\&quot; monster and make it appear even more flawless. Well, I can now consider my vanity well feed! This product left my skin looking airbrushed Photoshop perfect! What I really liked about it was that unlike other Asian BB creams that leave a grey undertone finish this product didn&#x27;t what so ever. It blended with my skin tone nicely and after wearing it for over 12 hours my face wasn&#x27;t left looking like an oily hot mess. Additionally, unlike other BB creams that tailor to the more \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; glow finishes this product has more of a beautiful matte finish that does leave a natural subtle glow to the skin. Though let me note that I do have oily/dry combo skin so I&#x27;m not a fan of the  \\&quot;Oh so dewy\\&quot; BB creams as these tend to promote more oil residue on me. The only qualm I have is that since the product itself is rather thick it takes more time to spread. However, remember that \\&quot;patience is a virtue\\&quot;, especially when it comes to something good! Keep in mind that the product&#x27;s thickness can be attributed to the high SPF 42 factor, which I&#x27;m not complaining about! We all know we should wear sunscreen, but ladies let&#x27;s face it, when we&#x27;re rushing to get out the door skipping out on sunscreen is easily done. So the fact that this product has exceptional SPF protection makes me all the more patient when applying it, as I&#x27;m already skipping out on concealer since the coverage is AMAZING - Good bye to my concealer and sad looking morning panda eyes! Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how the Missa M Perfect Cover B.B. cream worked for me!</li>
    <li> light to serious coverage (you decide during application), beautiful finish, does not cause breakouts with sensitive/acne prone skin, lasts all day, is not greasy (controls my oily skin), has improved my complexion since use .... just buy it (make sure it&#x27;s the right color though ... but it does blend quite well regardless).</li>
    <li> This is my favorite BB cream but it is so difficult to pick the right shade. I ended up buying the #27 which matches my warm tone much better. I still think this is a super BB cream just need to find the right color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I have tried other, but like this brand the best. The color is great and it gives an even coverage without looking cakey!</li>
    <li> I wanted to rate this item at a 4.5 however there was not that option. This is a great bb cream,  however the coverage is minimal and you can clearly still see blemishes. I guess if you have clear skin and want a BB Cream that has amazing spf,  then this is the bb cream for you. I basically use this bb cream when I go running outside or go for hikes, it has an amazing spf like I mentioned before, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it to go out for date or anything. Personally I like a better coverage, and have found lioele to do the trick for me♡</li>
    <li> It works pretty well but as I have oily skin, I have to set it with powder so it doesn&#x27;t make my face look greasy. As a product, it has great coverage, just those with oily skin be aware.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am not an everyday makeup wearer. For the past decade, I wore a mineral powder foundation when I \\&quot;put my face on\\&quot;. However, this winter I noticed my skin was a bit flaky and dry looking after applying. I have combination skin so I do exfoliate regularly and moisturize after washing. Since I&#x27;m approaching middle age fairly quickly and lines are starting to show, I decided I might need to get something with a little more coverage and to help with the dryness. I did some research to see what would work best for me. I wanted good coverage without the heavy feel of a liquid foundation. When I came across an article about BB creams, I thought it was too good to be true. But after researching it more, I knew I had to try it. I wanted a brand that was good but not too expensive. The reviews (not just at Amazon) for Missha brands seemed to say they were the best around in their price range. I have fair to medium skin tone (Scottish and Slavic-German heritage) with dark reddish-blonde hair so I choose the #23 Natural Beige. The day it came in I tried it and did notice the grey tinge that others complained about but it went away after blending. It matched perfectly! The coverage is awesome and evens out the little bit of ruddiness in my complexion. My skin looks and feels great! I have used it about a dozen times over the past few weeks and I think my skin looks better even on days I don&#x27;t wear any makeup. I am a believer!!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews from asian girls about how it worked well for them.  I&#x27;m here to say it works for us americans too.  I have the #23, I&#x27;m tan skinned but not too tan right now in the middle of winter.  I may have to up the shade in the summer but we&#x27;ll see.  I love the way this product looks on my skin, it blends in and makes it look like I have no foundation on at all.  I&#x27;ve used it for only a few days but my skin already looks better when I take it off.  The dark spots are definitely fading.  I also love how it has a high SPF so I dont have to worry about yet another layer on my skin of sunscreen.  You only need a small amount for your whole face so I can tell its going to last a long time.  It makes my skin dewy and not matte which i love because I look like i&#x27;m a real person.  All in all I love this buy it and you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Being a big fan of Skin79, I was very excited to try out this BB cream as I have heard that it is better. I fell for this stuff with the first application! I have combination oily/dry skin. This BB cream looks like you have applied a full face of foundation and powder without feeling like it. It has a matte finish and no cake-iness. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and can tell it has improved my skin. My skin feels softer and smoother and I am having less breakouts (most likely for no longer using heavy foundations and MAC powder.) I also love that it comes in so many different shades. I would advise going to the actual Missha website to pick out the shade you want and coming back to Amazon to purchase it. Even if I could not get the discounted price here at Amazon, I would still pay the full price for this product from Missha. It is THAT good. HTH!</li>
    <li> These is my first review on amazon ..i advise every women to buy this product ..it make your look natural and amaizing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fake.  The color is pasty white completely different from what I bought from Missha site.  I thought it away.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cover cream/foundation and this is perfect. It goes on easy, feels light weight and provides excellent coverage of skin discolorations.</li>
    <li> When I first read about BB creams, I purchased a couple of American brands at local stores.  They seemed more like tinted moisturizers and I thought there must be more to the Asian brands since everyone raves about them.  And they were right.  I loved this product.  It goes on thicker, more like a sunscreen and lasts all day.  It is a little ashy looking at first but the color settles in and blends very well.  My American brands are going by way of the garbage and I will continue to buy the Missha.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I cannot praise it enough. I accidentally found this product. I suddenly had breakouts and did not want chalky hard full coverage. I saw the name MISSHA on a beauty blog and I ordered it, hoping it was not hype. It is everything and more than it is.</li>
    <li> My first BB cream ever and I absolutely loved it. I don&#x27;t usually use it as much now, but it is still great. I have normal skin and it works well for me. The smell is quite strong, but even so I still love this product! Great coverage. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I had so many break outs and skin issues from using wronf facial products&lt;br /&gt;until I started using Missha!&lt;br /&gt;I even paid tons of money on all those name brand cover ups and&lt;br /&gt;never felt like it was making my skin look great.&lt;br /&gt;Once I tried this BB Cream I was so amazed with how low price BB Crea,&lt;br /&gt;could do so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am never changing to any other products from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not paid or told to write this review&lt;br /&gt;so I recommend this product to all my females looking for a awesome BB Cream!!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I love this missha bbb cream...the best bb cream i&#x27;ve ever use. Easy to apply and the result is amizing!</li>
    <li> This BB cream is freakin perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;It has the perfect amount of coverage it just evens out my skin tone and cover up tiny pigmentation spots its perfect for every day if you are going out in the sun!&lt;br /&gt;If you are worried about flash back from the SPF don&#x27;t be, I never noticed that it did, its the perfect colour match for me Im around NC20 and Its perfect, if it was a tad light just bronze up your face with some bronzer and BAM its done!</li>
    <li> This can start to streak on a hot day. There are alot of bb creams out there &amp; this one is just..eh... so so.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream... I love how it leaves my skin and the price is great. I actually used estee lauder bb cream before and after trying this I would never go back.</li>
    <li> Very good coverage ,  because it has mineral oil very bad for acne, skin cant stop breaking out, will use for chest and hands in a summer.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50s and need a certain amount of coverage, but wanted to scale back what I take along for travel. I have tried other BB creams, but they are made for younger and/or more flawless skin than mine. This is just perfect. Do take the advice of other reviewers and (gently) rub it into the skin somewhat. Even though it feels like I have practically nothing on my face, I am finding just the right amount of coverage, and there is more pigment left at the end of the day when I wash my face than with my regular cream foundation. Will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I 100% recommend this product.  It is not only amazing but makes my skin look beautiful.  I look like I have nothing on!</li>
    <li> this foundation will change your life. i know, sounds crazy. but i can put it on in the morning. go through my day, work out actively and my skin still looks good. i do wear a primer under it and the whole thing just stays. makes my skin look more even, younger. very very happy. and one tube lasts quite a while. you don&#x27;t need a lot to make a BIG difference.</li>
