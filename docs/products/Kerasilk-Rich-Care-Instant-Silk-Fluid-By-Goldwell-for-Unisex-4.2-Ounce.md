      <li>Regardless of length and style, if you prefer groomed healthy hair, this product is for you.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>My hair has never gotten so many compliments.</li>
      <li>I have tried most products on the market and nothing has ever helped.</li>
      <li>What else needs to be said? :)</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Makes ur hair so silky and easy to manage it has been a GOD send to me  </li>
      <li>This keeps my hair strong and gives it a sheen...</li>
      <li>I started with a tiny bit, and it worked beautifully.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have curly hair, and my hair isn&#x27;t that fine, so I can&#x27;t say it works for all types.</li>
      <li>This product helps smooth out the hair and silkens the texture.  </li>
      <li>I tried to wash it out of my hair with a fragrance free shampoo.</li>
      <li>the leave ins available work to a point.</li>
      <li>so am very pleased that Amazon offers.</li>
      <li>For dry, damaged or over colored hair it works out great.</li>
      <li>Absoutely a great product for thinning, dry and colored treated hair.  </li>
      <li>If you have major damage, you can do a repair at home by washing your hair, and rinsing with really warm water.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product and have been using for several years.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product highly!!!</li>
      <li>It really makes your hair silky smooth and manageable.</li>
      <li>I used to color AND perm my hair, gave up on coloring (its a losing battle), but always using this leave-in conditioner, my hair has always been frizz-free, calm, shiny, manageable.</li>
      <li>This product both conditions and nourishes the hair, allowing hair to grow very long and maintain healthy strong ends.</li>
      <li>perhaps it works better for straight and fine hair, but if you have curly hair, it&#x27;s not thick enough.</li>
      <li>Protects my hair from the hot hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Outstanding product - I am on my third (3) bottle.</li>
      <li>So I did something rare and unusual.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be stocking up on some more.</li>
      <li>I use several times per day to help with static.</li>
      <li>I prefer redken glass to make my hair shiny and soft - this is almost just too light.</li>
      <li>Kerasilk Rich Care Instant Silk Fluid is fantastic!!</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>I first used this product at my sister&#x27;s house.  </li>
      <li>Because of this product I am able to have long healthy shiny blonde hair.</li>
      <li>I put a small amour in my palm and massage through my wet hair and combing becomes much easier and it leaves my hair feeling great!</li>
      <li>The fact that Goldwell allows hair to grow long like when we were young doesn&#x27;t matter to most because most people have styles that get cuts regularly.</li>
      <li>actually received a free bottle of this from a contest i entered, and i didnt think much of it</li>
      <li>This product works really well on my hair</li>
      <li>It really makes your hair silky, and it doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.</li>
      <li>Very luxurious..I&#x27;d reccomend it to almost anyone.</li>
      <li>Absolutely none of them compare to Goldwell.</li>
      <li>This is a real leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of moisture without being too heavy like most moisturizers.</li>
      <li>I had tried conditioner after conditioner, none of which did much of anything for my fine, dry, colored hair except make it sag.  </li>
      <li>But after waiting so long for my order to arrive, a 5 star review didn&#x27;t seem accurate either.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Apply a thick layer and comb it through, wrap your head with plastic wrap or a cap, and keep a warm blow dryer on your hair for about 30 to 45 minutes,  Do a light rinse and towel dry.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair extremely soft and works really well with curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair shiny, soft and very manageable.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and tangle free long hair.</li>
      <li>Thankyou Goldwell for the only leave in treatment that allows me to have long healthy hair at age 39!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is great for everyday, after spritzing with water on my tight curl hair.</li>
      <li>I love Kerasilk Instant Silk Fluid and didn&#x27;t think it fair to leave a lousy 1 star review.</li>
      <li>We ordered this product because my wife had used it the past and love it.</li>
      <li>Instead of a 4.2 Fl.oz. bottle of Kerasilk Instant Silk Fluid, I was sent a 3.4 fl.oz bottle of Kerasilk Rich Keratin Care.  </li>
      <li>I see the results more when I blow dry the hair than when I let it air dry</li>
      <li>I have short, thinning, colored,  and also dry hair - doesn&#x27;t sound like hair to model shampoo&#x27;s on television, does it?  </li>
      <li>Well Gals, I could - this instant silk fluid&#x27; does wonders for it, this product is highly recommended by me and many of my personal friends who have seen the actual results of my hairs consistant top-one condition.  </li>
      <li>It costs a little more than other leave in conditioners</li>
      <li>This product really keeps the frizz down and seems to moisturize my hair.</li>
      <li>but I highly recommend it and the bottle lasts for ages even though it is smaller than other brands.</li>

<li> You only need a little bit and it makes my hair soft and shiney.  </li>
<li> I have thick, shoulder length hair and only need a couple of small squirts to keep my hair looking shiny and strong.</li>
<li> I use kerasilk shampoo and conditioner for extra dry, damaged, and unmanageable hair.</li>
<li> If it can make MY mess of hair all silky and soft and manageable, just imagine what it can do for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this a long time</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We ordered this product because my wife had used it the past and love it. Her hair condition is somewhat difficult to be treated and she only satisfied with Kerasilk.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this hair product to me, and it is FABULOUS!  It&#x27;s wonderful for gray and white hair.</li>
    <li> I use kerasilk shampoo and conditioner for extra dry, damaged, and unmanageable hair. These are staples that I could not live without. The silk fluid to me makes no difference on my curly hair. I prefer redken glass to make my hair shiny and soft - this is almost just too light. perhaps it works better for straight and fine hair, but if you have curly hair, it&#x27;s not thick enough.</li>
    <li> This is great for everyday, after spritzing with water on my tight curl hair. Leaves hair soft and tangle free long hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It leaves your hair extremely soft and works really well with curly hair.  I use this with the Kerasilk shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> WoW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats the only words i have for this product!  Ive always had long thick hair, and in 2005 i went swimming in a heavily chlorinated pool which damaged my hair beyond repair.  For the next TWO years, i tried everything to get my hair back to how it was, and nothing worked.  It was dry, always knotted, brittle, when it was wet, it felt like hay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually received a free bottle of this from a contest i entered, and i didnt think much of it, just thought &#x27;oh another disapointment&#x27; so i waited for a while, and as i was getting out of the shower one day, i had noticed it on the counter so i grabbed some, rain it through my hair, and was AMAZED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to look for it today (Im running low) and yeah, it may be a little expensive, but its completely worth it! without a doubt!</li>
    <li> This leave in serum makes hair more manageable, shinier and it seems to help with frizz as well.  For dry, damaged or over colored hair it works out great.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite hair care products! I only use it on special occasions because it&#x27;s pretty expensive, no matter how little you use. This is the softest my hair has ever been (at least until it washes out).</li>
    <li> Great, i like how it works,my hair looks great and shiny its works excellent when i used my ceramic iron to have perfect look hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 4 years now and it works great!! Also, my item came on time, was in great condition and was sold as it was described!!  I would definitely order from this service again!!</li>
    <li> I have VERY dry curly and often frizzy hair. I have tried most products on the market and nothing has ever helped. I now use Kerasilk every day and have been for the past year. My hair has never been softer. And it does not flatten it or take out the curl or body,</li>
    <li> Liked it have used this for years. I have curly hair and it helps control the frizz  try it too</li>
    <li> This product really keeps the frizz down and seems to moisturize my hair. I&#x27;ve been using this a long time and I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I have had my hair weaved blonde since I was 19. Because of this product I am able to have long healthy shiny blonde hair. This product both conditions and nourishes the hair, allowing hair to grow very long and maintain healthy strong ends. I put a nickel size amount on the ends of my hair every time I wash my hair. I have tried every leave in treatment in the drugstore and in salons. Absolutely none of them compare to Goldwell. Thankyou Goldwell for the only leave in treatment that allows me to have long healthy hair at age 39!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the leave ins available work to a point. The fact that Goldwell allows hair to grow long like when we were young doesn&#x27;t matter to most because most people have styles that get cuts regularly. If you want long hair this is the only product for you. Regardless of length and style, if you prefer groomed healthy hair, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and have been using for several years.  I cannot locate in a local store so am very pleased that Amazon offers.</li>
    <li> Great for HOUSTON humidity!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  I used to buy it at my hairdresser, but then we moved.  So happy to have found it again... Leaves hair shiny, soft and very manageable.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I always have a bottle of this around-it is a miracle treatment for dry, damaged hair. The product will repair even the most brittle, damaged hair--chemical or sun damaged. After some very expensive treatments at the salon, the woman washing my hair finally told me the product they were using.  If you color your hair, this is the product to buy. I have thick, shoulder length hair and only need a couple of small squirts to keep my hair looking shiny and strong. If you have major damage, you can do a repair at home by washing your hair, and rinsing with really warm water. Apply a thick layer and comb it through, wrap your head with plastic wrap or a cap, and keep a warm blow dryer on your hair for about 30 to 45 minutes,  Do a light rinse and towel dry. After that, you can just touch up with this product.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble combing through my hair after washing and this product was recommended to me by my stylist. I put a small amour in my palm and massage through my wet hair and combing becomes much easier and it leaves my hair feeling great! It costs a little more than other leave in conditioners but I highly recommend it and the bottle lasts for ages even though it is smaller than other brands.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product - I am on my third (3) bottle. I have short, thinning, colored,  and also dry hair - doesn&#x27;t sound like hair to model shampoo&#x27;s on television, does it?  Well Gals, I could - this instant silk fluid&#x27; does wonders for it, this product is highly recommended by me and many of my personal friends who have seen the actual results of my hairs consistant top-one condition.  It actually restyles your hairdo from previous day - I&#x27;m not kidding, it does, plus it is so refreshing to the scalp.  Absoutely a great product for thinning, dry and colored treated hair.  Just hope they don&#x27;t keep increasing the cost with our 5 STARS reviews. Keep this product at Amazon.      Keep it Amazon</li>
    <li> Makes your hair so shinny</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Kind of pricry, but it works magic for medium/thick hair. I don&#x27;t have curly hair, and my hair isn&#x27;t that fine, so I can&#x27;t say it works for all types. It really makes your hair silky, and it doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy. It&#x27;s almost like a lotion for your hair. Very luxurious..I&#x27;d reccomend it to almost anyone.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best product for keeping your hair in good condition.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this fragrance was designed for. I tried the shampoo &amp; conditioner. My husband couldn&#x27;t stop sneezing from it. I tried to wash it out of my hair with a fragrance free shampoo. The smell WILL NOT go away and my head is just pounding. I bought it based on good reviews but can&#x27;t even use it. It&#x27;s sickening.</li>
    <li> Makes ur hair so silky and easy to manage it has been a GOD send to me  love ove love it</li>
    <li> This product works wonders. It really makes your hair silky smooth and manageable. Will definitely be stocking up on some more.</li>
    <li> This is a real leave-in conditioner. Weightless, non-greasy, don&#x27;t use too much, a little goes a long way. I used to color AND perm my hair, gave up on coloring (its a losing battle), but always using this leave-in conditioner, my hair has always been frizz-free, calm, shiny, manageable. Yes, this is a great product! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and fine and when I dry it after my shower, it;s dry and flyaway.  I use this product and it makes my hair look like hair again.  Gives moisture and shine without weighing it down or making my hair feel greasy or oily.  I scrunch my hair so my curls come out and I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Excellent product wish I would had bought 2</li>
    <li> I have long frizzy curly hair.  This product helps smooth out the hair and silkens the texture.  I see the results more when I blow dry the hair than when I let it air dry</li>
    <li> Great product to smooth frizzy hair! I use several times per day to help with static. Use on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great product. Now I don&#x27;t have to go to our local salon. Plus you beat their prices as well..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.  Smoothes and shines.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is excellent.  I had tried conditioner after conditioner, none of which did much of anything for my fine, dry, colored hair except make it sag.  When I finally tried this product I was amazed.  It actually made my hair feel silky, with only one small application. (It says something like \\&quot;use the amount you need for your hair texture,\\&quot; which meant nothing to me).  I started with a tiny bit, and it worked beautifully. It took care of split ends, flyaways, and dryness.  It&#x27;s expensive but well worth it.  I also like the shampoo, which I tried after this one worked so well.</li>
    <li> I get these products for the wife and she&#x27;s never had any complaints. What else needs to be said? :)</li>
    <li> Instead of a 4.2 Fl.oz. bottle of Kerasilk Instant Silk Fluid, I was sent a 3.4 fl.oz bottle of Kerasilk Rich Keratin Care.  I decided I would try it instead of sending it back and it works well too.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells great, lasts all day.  I would recommend this product highly!!! My hair has never gotten so many compliments.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I first rub into the palm of my hand and then apply to my hair. It gives it a wonderful shine. Unfortunately, I just discovered that it has an ingredient that I&#x27;m allergic to. I hope to find another product that works so well.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It coats the hair so when drying it doesn&#x27;t snag and cause breakage, not to mention protect from heat.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the kerasilk fluid as the stores no longer sell this product.  I was desperate as I can&#x27;t put a comb through my hair without this product.  I received the order in less than a week.  Both lids were taped so there was no spillage.  Also it is the identical product to what I have been using.  Same color, same smell same results.  I would recommend this product to those of you who are skeptical.</li>
    <li> This keeps my hair strong and gives it a sheen...P.S. I have dreadlocks that had bleached tips and then dyed back to black.</li>
    <li> Great quality item to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> I have the thinnest hair I know of and this is the only leave in I can use. I also have highlighted hair, using bleach, so this brings back the softness my hair looses from this processing. I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it. Can&#x27;t find it in the huge size anymore, though. :(</li>
    <li> Kerasilk Rich Care Instant Silk Fluid is fantastic!! If you&#x27;ve never tried it and wonder if you should, the answer is YES! If it can make MY mess of hair all silky and soft and manageable, just imagine what it can do for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTOH....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery time from this seller is NOT fantastic. And I&#x27;m being polite. I don&#x27;t know how my recent order was shipped, but I DO know that I had to order ANOTHER bottle from a DIFFERENT seller just so I&#x27;d have enough to tide me over while I waited for the one I&#x27;d ordered from THIS seller to arrive. (Yes, I ordered the 2nd bottle online and yes, it was the one that arrived first.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 3 stars? I love Kerasilk Instant Silk Fluid and didn&#x27;t think it fair to leave a lousy 1 star review. But after waiting so long for my order to arrive, a 5 star review didn&#x27;t seem accurate either. So I did something rare and unusual. I compromised...proving that, yes, indeed there are people in the US who remember what that word means. (ahem!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t hesitate to buy the Kerasilk Silk Fluid! Just buy it from somewhere else. That is unless you LIKE having your orders shipped via Pony Express. Or camel. Or Yak.</li>
    <li> This product works really well on my hair and I have chemically relaxed hair. It&#x27;s just the right amount of moisture without being too heavy like most moisturizers. Good purchase!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair nice and full - Love this product!! You only need a little bit and it makes my hair soft and shiney.  Totally recommend it</li>
    <li> I first used this product at my sister&#x27;s house.  You don&#x27;t need much--one or two squirts. Comb through your hair to the ends and leave it in.  Therere&#x27;s no build up. Protects my hair from the hot hair dryer.</li>
