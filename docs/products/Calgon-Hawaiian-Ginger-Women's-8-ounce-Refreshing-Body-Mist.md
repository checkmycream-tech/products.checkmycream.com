      <li>such a beautiful light scent, stunning.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not over powering or strong at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is light</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved this stuff for decades, and am so glad that it&#x27;s still available online, since I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light, fresh and lovely, and I always get compliments when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>The product that this company NYHealthBeauty sends is not the original Calgon Hawaiian Ginger Body Mist (as shown in the picture) but a cheap looking product made in China.</li>
      <li>I kinda liked the older bottle style, but the new one tells me it&#x27;s still popular.</li>
      <li>and i was excited to get one.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light, sweet fragrance and does not have that alcohol smell some sprays have.</li>
      <li>This came in very quickly and is exactly what I wanted it to be!  </li>
      <li>This could be a good body spray to wear especially during the summer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using it, but the smell disappears quickly, before I could work 8 hours and when I leave work</li>
      <li>Smells sweet and fresh, purchased this for the summer time.</li>
      <li>Love this scent, its very fruity...relaxes me a lot ;)</li>
      <li>so I like to smell nice but not anything that&#x27;s too strong since I have a little one in my arms and up to my chest often.  </li>
      <li>I cannot find it anywhere else these days, and it is not only my favorite scent but</li>
      <li>I have been looking foe this perfume for a long time and when I finally found it I was so happy.</li>
      <li>Pretty swell.</li>
      <li>The wait wasn&#x27;t too long and the product was in safe packaging.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really care for calgon products</li>
      <li>My fav, Fast shipping thx</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s trendy enough for teenagers but adult enough for mature women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>my absolute favorite and why I searched hard to find it.</li>
      <li>First, the bottle is not the same as the bottle displayed, which is the orginal bottle I&#x27;m accustom to.</li>
      <li>So although the scent remains the same, the packaging is different, looks cheap, and I did not want to risk wearing directly on my clothes or skin some chemical which I do not trust.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was a gift to my daughter who has allergies for perfumes, the scent is very mild and she uses it everyday</li>
      <li>Why should I have to pay for return shipping when the seller is clearly at fault?</li>
      <li>Feels soft on.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of a soft breeze on a tropical beach.  </li>
      <li>SO, naturally , when she ran out of it, I ordered this bottle for her.  </li>
      <li>Amazon for making yet another hard to find item available.</li>
      <li>My daughter is the person who brought&lt;br /&gt;it into my house as I am not a person who generally uses scents, so I happened upon</li>
      <li>Calgon apparently has been bought by a company called ILEX which outsources its manufacturing to.</li>
      <li>I wore this body mist in early 2000, which I used to purchase from Rite-Aid or Duane Reade, but they stop selling it a long time ago; so when I saw it here I decided to order it.</li>

<li> Not a real Hawiian fragrance.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think the seller or Amazon has anything with the bottle&#x27;s new look, but it DID NOT smell the same as it did before when I use to use it, it has a faint diluted resemblence of the orginal smell.</li>

<li> and i cant find it in walmart or in other store</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried other scents than Hawaiian Mist, but why would&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Evelope was slightly opened but product was Ok.  </li>
<li> I am still nursing a little one</li>
<li> With a slogan like \\&quot;Take me away,\\&quot; how could you not love</li>
<li> The woman loves it... hard to find at the store these days...</li>
<li> I also recommend that it&#x27;s not neglected and is used at least once a month so that you may indulge in its tropical scent.</li>
<li> recommend that every woman have at least one bottle of Calgon Hawaiian Ginger stashed away in their bathroom.</li>
<li> /&gt;I was extremely annoyed at how this seller mis-represents its products.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t just cover up bad smells</li>
<li> I others could still smell it on me even after sweating all day as a Dance Instructor; anyway, I WON&#x27;T be buying another one :(</li>

    <li> This body spray smells really good!</li>
    <li> I had this when i was in college until i move here in US and i cant find it in walmart or in other store so i tried to check here in Amazon and i was excited to get one. The design was changed, its now an orange design but the scent still the same.</li>
    <li> Just love it,it is my very favorite body mist..People compliment me on it always..</li>
    <li> This was an okay product to me.  However, my sister thinks it&#x27;s the bomb!!</li>
    <li> My best friend loves this scent &amp; I only seem to find it on this site. So, I bought (2) bottles. They arrived on time &amp; were in great condition. I would definately reccommend the seller.</li>
    <li> Not a real Hawiian fragrance.  Using as room spray</li>
    <li> arrived on time  My  Grandaugters loved it too.My favorite fragrance.Been wearing it for years. Thank you for having this product</li>
    <li> The wife was happy to get this and I&#x27;m happy she is happy!</li>
    <li> My fav, Fast shipping thx</li>
    <li> It is great and I am enjoying it very much. Hope you have it avaiable on my next purchase. Please let me know by email.</li>
    <li> This is my cousin&#x27;s favorite.  She lives in Puerto Rico and can&#x27;t find this item anywhere.  So, I get it and mail it to her.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my daughter who has allergies for perfumes, the scent is very mild and she uses it everyday</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this stuff for decades, and am so glad that it&#x27;s still available online, since I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore. I kinda liked the older bottle style, but the new one tells me it&#x27;s still popular.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this is the best odor eliminator I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t just cover up bad smells&lt;br /&gt;in the bathroom and around the litter box, it eliminates them.  Things like air fresheners and&lt;br /&gt;fabreze have nothing on this mist.  I haven&#x27;t tried other scents than Hawaiian Mist, but why would&lt;br /&gt;I; the scent is pleasant and when it&#x27;s gone, so is the odor. My daughter is the person who brought&lt;br /&gt;it into my house as I am not a person who generally uses scents, so I happened upon it&#x27;s amazing&lt;br /&gt;odor eliminating powers by accident!</li>
    <li> Calgon is what some would refer to as \\&quot;so yesterday.\\&quot; For me, Calgon Hawaiian Ginger body mist is timeless, the entire reason I became \\&quot;turned on\\&quot; to Calgon. With a slogan like \\&quot;Take me away,\\&quot; how could you not love it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each and every time I spritz a bottle of Hawaiian Ginger, it takes me back to yesterday, the same place people assume Calgon should stay (usually those who&#x27;ve never tried it). The fragrance is both fruity and spicy, perfect for a morning of sun-bathing or a night on the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light but it still lingers throughout the day. I&#x27;m always complimented when wearing the sultry scent. It&#x27;s trendy enough for teenagers but adult enough for mature women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that every woman have at least one bottle of Calgon Hawaiian Ginger stashed away in their bathroom. I also recommend that it&#x27;s not neglected and is used at least once a month so that you may indulge in its tropical scent.</li>
    <li> I loved the scent and the price. I have been looking foe this perfume for a long time and when I finally found it I was so happy.</li>
    <li> love this scent. cant get enough.</li>
    <li> A bit strong but smells really good.</li>
    <li> This body spray smells so tangy and fruity. The smell reminds me of peach which I totally love. This could be a good body spray to wear especially during the summer. I picked up this bottle at the store today and it was the last one that they had on the shelves. I wasn&#x27;t so attracted by other scents from Calgon but I was definately hooked by this. It was a good buy.</li>
    <li> The product that this company NYHealthBeauty sends is not the original Calgon Hawaiian Ginger Body Mist (as shown in the picture) but a cheap looking product made in China. Calgon apparently has been bought by a company called ILEX which outsources its manufacturing to. So although the scent remains the same, the packaging is different, looks cheap, and I did not want to risk wearing directly on my clothes or skin some chemical which I do not trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely annoyed at how this seller mis-represents its products. Nowhere on the page does it tell you that this is not Calgon by Coty, but is in fact Calgon by ILEX. The picture is meant to mislead people. In my eyes, this constitutes product fraud. And when they were contacted about it, they told me to ship the product back, and I would be refunded. Why should I have to pay for return shipping when the seller is clearly at fault? I got my money back through Amazon A-to-Z guarantee, and will never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a light, pleasant body spray that will not have those riding in the elevator with you wondering who on Earth put on too much cologne, give this a try.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and I don&#x27;t really care for calgon products but I have been buying this spray off and on for years and I love it. It&#x27;s a very sweet summer scent and it&#x27;s not over powering or strong at all. Plus for the price it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Love the body  mist, but I don&#x27;t use it for my body. I use it on my bedroom, living room, etc. It makes my house smell good.</li>
    <li> This came in very quickly and is exactly what I wanted it to be!  I am still nursing a little one so I like to smell nice but not anything that&#x27;s too strong since I have a little one in my arms and up to my chest often.  It&#x27;s a light, sweet fragrance and does not have that alcohol smell some sprays have.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite spray scent; it&#x27;s nice and tropical. A friend insists it smells like cucumber, but I don&#x27;t get it myself.</li>
    <li> First, the bottle is not the same as the bottle displayed, which is the orginal bottle I&#x27;m accustom to. I wore this body mist in early 2000, which I used to purchase from Rite-Aid or Duane Reade, but they stop selling it a long time ago; so when I saw it here I decided to order it. I don&#x27;t think the seller or Amazon has anything with the bottle&#x27;s new look, but it DID NOT smell the same as it did before when I use to use it, it has a faint diluted resemblence of the orginal smell. I&#x27;m still using it, but the smell disappears quickly, before I could work 8 hours and when I leave work I others could still smell it on me even after sweating all day as a Dance Instructor; anyway, I WON&#x27;T be buying another one :(</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife after she aquired a bottle from a friend.  WOW,  It smells really great on her.  SO, naturally , when she ran out of it, I ordered this bottle for her.  Came as promised.  Packaged in bubble wrap inside a standard 8x11 envelope. Evelope was slightly opened but product was Ok.  No damage inside.</li>
    <li> my absolute favorite and why I searched hard to find it.</li>
    <li> 100% recommended excellent product</li>
    <li> such a beautiful light scent, stunning.</li>
    <li> The wait wasn&#x27;t too long and the product was in safe packaging. I have no complaints at all! Pretty swell.</li>
    <li> Love this scent, its very fruity...relaxes me a lot ;)</li>
    <li> Smells sweet and fresh, purchased this for the summer time.</li>
    <li> There is a picture of the product i purchased , and expected to receive.  This, however, is not what I had received in the mail.  I was quite dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to find this on Amazon. I cannot find it anywhere else these days, and it is not only my favorite scent but the only one I use.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, fresh and lovely, and I always get compliments when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for making yet another hard to find item available.</li>
    <li> Love this scent! Everyone else does too!</li>
    <li> The woman loves it... hard to find at the store these days...</li>
    <li> I like to wear this after swimming.  It smells great and very fresh.  It reminds me of a soft breeze on a tropical beach.  It is not greasy or oily.  Feels soft on.</li>
