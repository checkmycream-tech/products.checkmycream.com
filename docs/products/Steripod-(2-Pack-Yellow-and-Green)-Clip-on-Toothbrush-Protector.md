<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these to keep my toothbrush safe in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time and was exactly what I was looking for,</li>
    <li> I was tired of using vanity-top toothbrush holders, because they (at least the ones we owned) constantly grow lots of gross mold down at the bottom and are nearly impossible to clean.  Plus, when sitting out on the vanity your toothbrush is fair game for any bacteria floating around the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the alternatives were any better.  I didn&#x27;t really want my toothbrush sitting unprotected in a drawer either, and I figured a standard travel toothbrush cover would get grimy over time too.  And I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the extra nuisance of one of the UV sterilizers that are expensive and always break or don&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome solution:  steripods!  LOVE them!  Keep toothbrush protected and supposedly even sterile (disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t attempted to grow any cultures myself to prove this claim).  Fits every toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried (including electric).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be great for traveling and when your toothbrush is sitting on a hotel vanity, but is awesome for everyday use.  Hides your toothbrush and keeps it clean.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush covers!</li>
    <li> I bought these to protect my toothbrush when traveling. They&#x27;re light, not too big, and work great for protecting electric toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> Okay, I have not performed scientific tests to see whether these keep the toothbrush sterile or not but it gives me the emotional satisfaction whereby I think it is being kept clean.  I travel quite a bit for work and these give me confidence that my toothbrush is being kept from getting a lot of nasty disease causing germs.  So it may not be totally sterile but it does give me peace of mind and that is all that I need.  At least I am attempting to do something.</li>
    <li> must have keeps tooth brush heads clean! so glad i bought it.</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, this works as advertised. These have a strong, antiseptic, scent (due to the Thymol on the small pad within the pod). When I recieved these, the blue of the pod&#x27;s seal was already broken, so I don&#x27;t use that one. I&#x27;m fairly certain this occurred during shipping but nevertheless, it&#x27;s money down the drain. I almost never have trouble with Amazon, so I can&#x27;t complain much. I&#x27;m continuing to use the pink one since I really only needed it as a &amp;#34;dust/hair cover&amp;#34; anyway. If you need the Thymol, I&#x27;d suggest  buying these at the store yourself if at all possible...just to avoid any potential accidents with your packaging.</li>
    <li> Love these for my toothbrush I take on trips with me. I had a blue light sanitizer that broke and these work just as nice and less bulky. Plus you get two of them so you have a replacement when the first runs out of antibacterial.</li>
    <li> These clip on yoru toothbrush like hair clips. I just feel more hygienic using them. Easy to wash in the dishwasher too.</li>
    <li> I always thought toothbrush sanitizers were unnecessary inventions made for hypochondriacs, but my grandma bought me a pair of these and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since! I can always find them on amazon for a great price and they really do leave your toothbrush feeling much cleaner and sanitary.  I especially like it when traveling because it protects my toothbrush while I&#x27;m transporting it.</li>
    <li> These sanitizers provide enough ventilation to allow the water on the toothbrush to evaporate, which I&#x27;ve found to be the most important feature in a toothbrush sanitizer.</li>
    <li> Clean &amp; peace of mind. I liked them so much I gifted them to a friend who is equally paranoid about bathroom bacteria.</li>
    <li> Started using these for travel only but like them so much I use them daily on my toothbrush at home too!</li>
    <li> I like it because is not the the ordinary toothbrush heads, these are funky colors love it. I bougt it for me and my hubby. Thank you</li>
    <li> I try never to run out of these. Keeps germs away and great for travel. Plus they fit all toothbrushes</li>
    <li> as ordered but wish same color in pack not two different especially common colors like two pink or two blue</li>
    <li> I really like them. But find them at target for the same price without shipping</li>
    <li> Like these, seem to keep my toothbrush clean.  Will buy more.</li>
    <li> My husband brushes his teeth in the shower, which I find gross, so I purchased a two pack of these and put one on his toothbrush. I worried about germs collecting on the brush because he didn&#x27;t have anything covering the bristles. He said that he can tell a difference.</li>
    <li> This gadget is such a great idea! I don&#x27;t know how it sanitizes or to what degree but it gives me the peace of mind that the toilet germs aren&#x27;t getting to my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> this is my second sets of covers.  The first set lasted for a couple of years before breaking.  Great way to keep your wet brush cleaner when traveling!</li>
    <li> always use them for our toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I got this because my bathroom sometimes has mold problems and it has gotten into regular toothbrush toppers in the past.  So far this keeps the toothbrush sanitized from all that.  It gives it a nice clean smell too, I still rinse off my toothbrush before using it just to be sure.</li>
    <li> I have had a steripod on my OralB battery operated toothbrush for about 3 weeks.  After brushing this evening, I noticed some black stuff in the cracks of my toothbrush.  I popped the head off my toothbrush and there was BLACK MOLD inside!!!  I have been putting this in my mouth!!!  Am I going to get sick now?  I thought I was using this so I could avoid germs and mold... not create them!  I used the steripod correctly... rinsed before and after brushing, shook out extra water before putting the steripod on.  Maybe it works on a regular toothbrush... but I won&#x27;t be trying it.  My family all used these...but they are now going in the garbage!</li>
    <li> Allegedly kills germs and is a superior place to store your precious toothbrushes.  The only knock I would say is that it only lasts up to 3 months so it can start adding up in terms of cost.</li>
    <li> These are good because they are easy to put on and take off. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Not sure how sanitary they actually are, but they are good for traveling to protect the toothbrush head. It fits well on my sonicare. Just make sure to rinse brush well before using after this has been on it.</li>
    <li> Love, love love these pods. I have used these for the past year. Even though I may not worry about the germs in my own home, it is very nice to have these when I&#x27;m traveling. I hated those plastic toothbrush holders  because they are so hard to clean and they are probably filled with germs.</li>
    <li> Have bought them a couple of times, nice to have these covers to protect my toothbrushest from wayward germs.</li>
    <li> We have to keep our toothbrushes on the counter since we have the oral b vitality brushes that need to be charged on a base, these pods are a perfect way to have an easy cap for your toothbrushes to keep away nasty toilet germs from when someone flushes the toilet without lowering the lid!</li>
    <li> Keeps toothbrush clean but does not last long,</li>
    <li> These fit my battery operated oscillating toothbrushes. That&#x27;s why I bought them. Vibrant colors and durable plastic. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The translucent plastic is nice looking, not cheap.  They are easy to put on and take off, and they grip the toothbrush securely.  Most importantly, they give the bristles breathing room, so that you&#x27;re not trapping germs in a most environment.  Having had mildew issues with travel toothbrush holders, I can say that these are a definite improvement.</li>
    <li> they really do work well just wish it was for longer than a couple of weeks!</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!! Great investment for those germaphobes like myself!!!</li>
    <li> fast service, great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Yes these stink when you first open them but after they&#x27;ve been out for a day or so you&#x27;ll never notice the smell unless you&#x27;re sticking your nose in it. Dont notice them causing any funny taste and fit my toothbrush fine. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I love the steripod for my toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Great service!&lt;br /&gt;Great to take them when you travel!</li>
    <li> I bought it to protect my toothbrush from busy areas.  It is where I wash my hair, spray it, makeup, clean and other things.  My toothbrush is protected</li>
    <li> Hoping this will help to sanitize the children&#x27;s&#x27; toothbrushes.  Will probably use these for travel.  I&#x27;m not thrilled that it will be necessary for thrm to rinse their brushes off before use due to the chemical..  Would have preferred chemical free.</li>
    <li> These are the best toothbrush covers.  They keep your brush fresh - no weird smells build up if you keep a toothbrush in your desk or travel bag for extended periods of time.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores was more than happy to find them here. Great to travel with and to use as an every day cover for your toothbrush, Will buy more.</li>
    <li> I do enjoy these products! The reason it got 4 stars is because of the two sets I bought, all of them has a little puncture, making the sterilizer part partially used up before I have even used it on my toothbrush. :/</li>
    <li> I keep my travel toothbrush in one and it has yet to come out of it and my toothbrush feels cleaner. it doesn&#x27;t have that stale I haven&#x27;t been sued in three weeks feel.</li>
    <li> We use these instead of those little fold up travel toothbrushes. We can easily clip this on and throw our normal good quality brush in our suitcase or camping stuff and not have to worry about it.</li>
    <li> Great, lets toothbrushes stay away from germs.</li>
    <li> Fits my different sized toothbrushes great!</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling or for use at home. Keeps your toothbrush clean and protected.</li>
    <li> Simply the best, makes sure that your toothbrush is bacteria free and I love the color combo!!</li>
    <li> Love these. I feel like it keeps my toothbrush nice and fresh. I am a frequent traveler and this is by far the best toothbrush cover I have come across. I like that it snaps over the toothbrush instead of the kind that smoosh over the top. The bristles stay fresh and clean when thrown into my toiletry bag, and what more could you ask for than that.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years and couldn&#x27;t find them in the store where I normally get them so I bought them here.</li>
    <li> This is cute. It fits well on my electric tooth brush. I just hope that it does what they say it does, sanitize the tooth brush. No way to check that, but it keeps bugs away from the brush.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really no way of knowing if this is disinfecting my toothbrushes or not, but it does a good job of protecting the toothbrush&#x27;s head from airborne germs in the bathroom (e.g., from flushing the toilet). For the peace of mind and ease of putting this on/taking it off several times of day, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> These brush covers are such a great idea. My whole family uses these. It&#x27;s especially handy for traveling. I like that they come in different colors too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after a few weeks the pod seems to keep moister inside that never dries out. I still like the idea of keeping my brush protected, but I decided to toss it out just in mold grows inside.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy to clean</li>
    <li> Great price for a product that makes me feel clean!</li>
    <li> It works well - easy to use - and keeps my toothbrush clean and covered.  I would happily recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are very handy for travel and at home.  I bought them for travel but now that I am home I am continuing to use them.</li>
    <li> great for your toothbrushes.  I keep my toothbrush on counter and can be exposed to hair products, etc.  this keeps my toothbrush safe and clean</li>
    <li> l love these sterile toothbrush holders. Work great to keep my toothbrush clean. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> A great way to keep the head of your toothbrush clean.  I brought these just for traveling but now I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Love the steripods! I wish they came in other colors but they are great for keeping my toothbrushes clean</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t drop, thingy inside falls off.</li>
    <li> I hate leaving my toothbrush exposed in the bathroom - and this allowed me to not only cover my soniccare tooth brushes but it also sanitizes them while they are on them.  The clip on style makes it a universal fit on any toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Carry these with us where ever we travel.  Not sure they really work, but the reassurance is good for me.  Hate having a hotel housekeeper moving my tooth brush around.</li>
    <li> I feel a lot better capping the toothbrushes with these protectors. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I am using the one and have my tooth brush in it , but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working or not. I might have to try something else. Thanks Lori</li>
    <li> Love these and they arrived very quickly!</li>
    <li> In a study in the Scholar&#x27;s Day Review, toothbrushes stored in steripods had more than 3 times the environmental bacteria colonies as those just left sitting out.  These might keep outside things from getting on your toothbrush, but they cause the bacteria already there to multiply!</li>
    <li> I feel like they might work, so I use them.  They are reasonably priced, and if they help me fight off bacteria and illness, I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
    <li> I was googling for a toothbrush cover and came across this item.  Neat idea! I went to their website and watched the video explaining how the steripod cover works to kill bacteria.  Heck, I just thought I&#x27;d get a cover, but since it came with the bacteria killing stuff in it, why not?  The clips are easy to pinch, even for my arthritic fingers.  I like the colors they come in.  I bought some for my grandkids too, since their toothbrushes are just thrown into their cups, unprotected.  I like that it is not battery reliable or plug-in.  It&#x27;s very convenient and easy to replace.  Amazon had the best price for these things, so far as I know.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if they actually make my toothbrush more sanitary, but they make me feel more sanitary, and that&#x27;s gotta count for something.</li>
    <li> I needed a toothbrush cover that was easy to use for my second home since I&#x27;m only there 3 month of the year. This worked great while I&#x27;m away.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure if these really offer any type of sterilization to my toothbrush but at least they keep it covered.  It&#x27;s just nice knowing my toothbrush hasn&#x27;t collected particles of whatever is floating in the air, one being hairspray.  And, to be honest, I don&#x27;t change them every three months, as suggested.  I buy a new one whenever it looks like it&#x27;s getting dirty.  I rinse it off a few times a week but eventually it starts looking scratched and cloudy looking.</li>
    <li> Keep your toothbrush clean!! Nice little gadget!</li>
    <li> perfect for traveling</li>
    <li> A fantastic product. This way you don&#x27;t have to worry about throwing your toothbrush into a gross drawer or letting germs get on it because no one at your house closes the toilet seat! I like this product and find it very useful and will definitely order more when I need them.</li>
    <li> I originally bought these to cover my oral-b toothbrush when I put it in a bag to travel.  However, I find that I use them all the time at home, to protect my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Stylish &amp;user friendly</li>
    <li> Seriously keeps the smell and bacteria off my toothbrush. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference since I&#x27;ve been using these.</li>
    <li> I really liked using these pods on our last trip because they kept our toothbrushes clean and sanitary while traveling and while in sitting out in the hotel bathroom.  At home we keep them in a cabinet, but that was not possible in this situation so I liked having the extra protection for the bristles. Also worked well while they were being transported in the toiletry bag.  Not sure how long they last so I will buy again for our next trip.</li>
    <li> These are awesome, keeps your toothbrush clean and is also a travel case. I recommend it to anyone especially if you take your toothbrush with you.</li>
    <li> I live in a care facility, so I always want my toothbrush head covered. Typical covers are almost airtight, meaning it develops a strange odor in a short time- not cool in something you want to put in your mouth. These keep the head of toothbrush covered, and kill some germs at the same time. Make sure you rinse head of toothbrush well before and after brushing. I put the date on mine with sharpie, so I will know when 3 months is up. I paid around $5 for a two pack, so $2.50 a pop. I felt this was more than a fair price.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Prompt delivery .  Thanks</li>
    <li> I love these things especially for travelling who knows what my toothbrush head touches and its microbiobial and there is enough of that in my mouth I dont need any additions from my make up bag.</li>
    <li> This is a great invention. It&#x27;s great for travel and is a must have. It&#x27;s very inexpensive. I love it.</li>
    <li> Product works exactly as described.  Keeps toothbrushes clean despite kids&#x27; best efforts.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if these actually work to sterilize your toothbrush or not. I&#x27;m pretty optimistic, so I&#x27;d like to think so.  What I like most about it, though, are the fact that it covers the toothbrush head from any bacteria floating around the bathroom, such as from flushing the toilet, and I also like these for traveling.  My electric toothbrush doesn&#x27;t fit in a standard toothbrush travel case, not to mention how nasty those things can get.  I have been happy with these and will buy more!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my toothbrush at work.  Has a smell to it that I can&#x27;t quite place... maybe Listerine?  At least that means it&#x27;s doing something.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I love that these keep my toothbrush covered and that it sterilizes at the same time. I like the blue.  Easy to use at home and good to go for travel.</li>
    <li> I love these pods. I&#x27;m confident that my toothbrush is clean for my next use. I use body spray and hairspray and I don&#x27;t have to worry that these products get on my electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Very handy for travel.  Makes it easy NOT to confuse similar looking  toothbrushes in brush holder.</li>
    <li> I love how these Steripods keep our toothbrushes so clean and fresh. They bristles never touch the ones on the next guy&#x27;s toothbrush. They&#x27;re also not open to all the flying bacteria every time someone flushes the toilet. The clip mechanism is easy to operate and is smooth when opening and closing. There&#x27;s an essential-oil-type of scent that you can smell when you remove the toothbrush but it isn&#x27;t annoying and besides, your toothpaste should mask it.</li>
    <li> I love these tooth brush covers. They got any tooth brush and kill the bacteria.</li>
    <li> I no longer have to worry about what sorts of bacteria could be on my toothbrush. It is also great for travel. I can just throw my toothbrush into my bag.</li>
    <li> There is a green substance that come from the &amp;#34;pod&amp;#34; and get onto the tooth brush but can be rinsed off and has no foul smell. I have such a small bathroom and it skeeves me out that the toilet is flushing close to my toothbrush and my fiancé leaves his toothbrush in the shower, so these pods are PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend these. Also: such a cute little gift to include in a housewarming basket or something like that!</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Others have mentioned a taste that is on the brush after using, but I have not found that to be true.  Protects the brush well during travel as well.  I will purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> I love these because they fit over the head of a regular toothbrush or a battery powered one. Perfect for travel and camp and keeping your toothbrush bristles off the hotel bathroom counter or wherever your kid may lay his toothbrush at camp, bleh.  They put it on and it keeps it clean and sterile.  At least they say they do and it seems so.</li>
    <li> I use one on my toothbrush at home and one for the toothbrush in my travel bag.  Fits any toothbrush and is compact and easy to use.  Especially great in hotel bathrooms</li>
    <li> I like these little toothbrush toppers a lot.  They seem to do the job. I&#x27;d definitely purchase them again. :)</li>
    <li> My Tooth Brush is bad particles free, I seriously think I have pet peeves, so have this make me feel even more secure about the possible germs that could potentially attack my tooth brush. I love it.</li>
    <li> No idea if these work as described but they make me feel better.</li>
    <li> I like knowing that my toothbrush is safe from germs, but I just wish the packaging explained exactly how it&#x27;s being decontaminated. It doesn&#x27;t say anything about what the gray sand like substance is. Overall it&#x27;s nice, but I think I&#x27;d rather have something with a UV light. These kind of have an awkward smell to them.</li>
    <li> I love the steripod everything is fine. It comes in cool colors too. However, each pod only lasts up to 3 months!</li>
    <li> Love these! Worth your dollars!</li>
    <li> My Niece loves the Steripods that I sent to her</li>
    <li> Awesome idea. My toothbrush smells and feels cleaner. I recommend this to everyone, and they&#x27;re much cheaper on amazon than in a store.</li>
    <li> No way to really test, mine was weird looking on the inside. My husband&#x27;s looked better. I don&#x27;t know...</li>
    <li> I looked all over for a toothbrush holder that would work with electric toothbrush heads. The rectangular travel covers sold at big-box stores crushed the bristles and were awkwardly long. Other holders also pushed on the bristles and I worried the rotating heads would be damaged as I pulled hard to insert or remove them. The Steripod opens and closes on hinges so I don&#x27;t have to drag the head in and out of it. It accommodates the size of Oral-B electric heads without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything antibacterial but the Steripod apparently works for that. The instructions say to rinse the toothbrush after removal from the pod and before use, but I wonder if that removes everything that should be removed. There is a strong smell on the toothbrush before rinsing and it remains very slightly after rinsing. Hopefully the rinse is just to remove a smell and there is no actual chemical on the toothbrush, but the instructions didn&#x27;t mention either way.</li>
    <li> I love these steripods! It is the 2nd set I have bought, and will continue to use them.&lt;br /&gt;Once you get started using them, you get used to putting it back and keeping it safe and sanitized in there.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for travel, and great for your bathroom! I use it on the go, and if I happen to carry a toothbrush with me in a makeup bag, it stays put and great to take with me with my floss.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Great product for traveling to keep toothbrushes clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about a month now &amp; really enjoy them. I obviously don&#x27;t notice a difference but I do know that our toothbrushes are protected from bathroom germs.</li>
    <li> I love my new steripods!  They are great to travel with, I love the colors, and I know my toothbrush is safe from any germs in my bathroom!  I bought one for me and my boyfriend so we both have clean mouths :)</li>
    <li> does the job....cheaper than buying a similar product in the store....</li>
    <li> The clip is awesome... easy to open and close... I had the other styles and it wasn&#x27;t that difficult to open and close but this is just brainless...</li>
    <li> I LOVE these. It may be a total placebo effect but I feel better having my toothbrush in these.</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush protectors I have yet to find. I purchased these as gifts for the gal in my leasing office, and she loved them. She said she and her boyfriend finally feel &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; leaving their toothbrushes out on the counter! Very true... if you have ever read the studies about what lurks around restrooms and clings to your toothbrush bristles.</li>
    <li> These are awesome and I would recommend getting some!</li>
    <li> These things are awesome!! First found at Target, but came to Amazon to find again. Great little keeper/ holder for your toothbrush AND helps keep germs off... win win 5 stars!!!!</li>
    <li> I would like to think these suckers work! Fits my toothbrush if inserted at an angle.  Wish it was made slightly larger. Other than that, great to use for travel.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stand the smell. Just opened the package and could smell it instantly. Thought it would go away, but an hour later, the whole bathroom smelled extremely strong. I&#x27;m very prone to headaches when it comes to strong scents, so I had to throw these out.</li>
    <li> I Like it. To me, is nexpensive way to keep your Toothbrush covered.</li>
    <li> easy to use and gives me the peace of mind that I&#x27;m not sticking a bacteria wand into my mouth each time I brush! Fits on my normal toothbrush, as well as my electric oral-B round head brush. Also great for traveling, goodbye ziplock bags! Will be buying from now on.</li>
    <li> These are the best for traveling or daily use.  They never get mold like so many other holders.  I will be buy more!!!! :)</li>
    <li> These clip on toothbrush protectors are awesome!!! I use this mostly at my boyfriend&#x27;s house because he stores toothbrushes in a drawer organizer. I didn&#x27;t like the idea of my toothbrush just sitting there unprotected so I went looking and found this. The vapor smell is not too overwhelming and they keep your toothbrush nice and fresh. I use mine a little longer than the package recommends because I want it more to protect the toothbrush from sitting directly on things as opposed to using it to kill germs.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t done any lab tests to verify if this product works, but I suspect that it works well enough. It has a very strong smell that is similar to the smell of original flavor Listerine, which leads me to assume it contains thymol, the active ingredient in Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something to clip on my toothbrush, because I don&#x27;t like to leave my toothbrush in the bathroom. This fits it with plenty of room to spare. I don&#x27;t know if the tymol keeps the toothbrush itself clean, but I imagine it keeps the clip from developing mold, which is a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone wanting to be sure that the toothbrush is clean, dip it in a little Listerine before brushing.</li>
    <li> These are perfect, no battery required toothbrush protectors. I love them because the thought of leaving my toothbrush open in a small bathroom where not everyone flushes with the lid irks me. You can use them for travel too, except they&#x27;re not really designed to fit really snuggly around the toothbrush to aid the drying of the toothbrush. But, I can use my toothbrush and not search for a place to put it. I just clip, put it wherever and forget about it. First world problems, I know. But, you&#x27;re browsing amazon, too.</li>
    <li> I really like that this keeps our toothbrushes cover..our toothbrushes sit on the bathroom counter and i do my make up and hair and with spraying hair products it gets everywhere..this product keeps my brush covered and clean..</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have bought these. I love them for travel and use them at home too. I don&#x27;t notice a smell as others have stated. They do the job I want. I recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> I love not worrying about what&#x27;s getting on my toothbrush! I will be purchasing these regularly from now on!</li>
    <li> Love these!  I can only find these on Amazon</li>
    <li> Whether it&#x27;s used as a disinfectant, or just as a handy toothbrush cover, this is an all around great product. It should be switched every 3 months, as the part that works as the disinfectant starts to change color. The clip-on effect is fun and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend giving it a try!!</li>
    <li> Great little toothbrush covers.  Easy to use.  Perfect for an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Keeps my toothbrush fresh and germ-free (I hope).  I like how they last 3 months.</li>
    <li> The whole family loves them! They&#x27;re great for keeping our toothbrushes clean from nasty airborne bathroom germs &amp; they travel well, too. The best thing about them is that they fit on all of our different types of toothbrushes, including our electric brushes. We highly recommend these to anyone who wants to keep germs off of their toothbrushes and out of their mouths!</li>
    <li> Great product and keeps our brushes clean and stored safely.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, See previous review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very practical for a traveling consultant like me - snaps right around the head of the toothbrush while letting some air come in (which means the toothbrush is easy to pack up but can dry out), and fits all different sizes of toothbrushes that I have. Bought extra and shared with friends and coworkers.</li>
    <li> The Steripods are one great invention.  They keep our tooth brushes free of germs and keeps them santized.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase them.</li>
