      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
      <li>And the amount of henna you are given can honestly do 30 of the stencil designs.</li>
      <li>She liked it,</li>
      <li>I will buy the REFILL kit, and my own bottles w/tips, but not the beginner kit.</li>
      <li>I loved this all-in-one kit and it was perfect for the two weeks that my 7 year old daughter was in recovery from a tonsillectomy.</li>
      <li>The color started a brighter orange, but has turned a nice shade of red-brown (brighter color on my ankle, deeper brown on my shoulder).  </li>
      <li>The decals were helpful, though some of the girls wanted their own designs.</li>
      <li>It is amazing and the instructions are really easy to understand and follow!</li>

      <li>The kit is easy and the instructions are good (even though we didn&#x27;t read them fully).</li>
      <li>The oil did a fairly good job of transferring the stencil (more oil on the area made the stencil transfer darker) and I noticed the henna stuck better to the spots that I had used the oil.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to transfer</li>
      <li>Its very easy to do</li>
      <li>So far the tattoos have been on for over a week and are still looking great!  </li>
      <li>I have tried others, and this is by far the BEST!  </li>
      <li>perfect gift for my 15 year old cousin.</li>
      <li>If you buy it,  use it at your own risk and be sure to inform others of the ingredients before using it on them.    </li>

      <li>clean toothpicks are a good idea and some q-tips for blobs or</li>
      <li>The color is very light and takes HOURS for it to have any effect</li>
      <li>we were so impressed on how many tattoos you get with this item, as well as you really don&#x27;t need to have artistic talent.  </li>
      <li>Either of those would do better.</li>
      <li>you accidentally freeze your henna, throw it away and purchase some more.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I found that the transfer of the stencil worked better if you used more eucalyptus oil.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>The henna was fresh and good quality.</li>
      <li>Make sure their skin doesn&#x27;t react to it before you do their tattoo.</li>
      <li>The longer the paste stays on, the better the tattoo will be.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no way this could be used on more than 3-4 hands, max.  </li>

      <li>Many of her friends use it too.  </li>
      <li>My girls love it.</li>
      <li>sure...</li>
      <li>you get much better color.</li>
      <li>We loved it and had lots of fun.  </li>
      <li>I am a beginner and I have five gorgeous henna tattoos on me right now.  </li>
      <li>I kind of laughed at the inclusion of toothpicks in the kit, but I learned quickly that you will make mistakes, and make accidental smears that will need to be quickly taken care of.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Now if I can just my wife to sit still long enough to get her decorated.  She liked it, sure... and there are some neat patterns and all the basics supplied for trying henna art.  But be prepared that henna takes a while to actually stay on the skin.  With that in mind, if you want something cheap, simple and fun to try, this has got all you need, just like the package description says.</li>
    <li> Watch out for leaks in your bag. Will stink up your room (euculiptus oil? maybe) just sitting in the box. Depends how you  like that smell. Art stencils are transfers that look like a cheap xerox copy paper with designs folded in your box. Supposivly transfer with the oil, dunno they looked cheapy hand drawn with 2 tribals in there. Much harder than it seems to draw, much like drawing with toothpaste out of a large needle but you have to let it stain the skin. Directions say for 6hrs i did 2 30min coats and got a dark burnt orange look.</li>
    <li> after i applied the henna to my hand i left it on through the night while i was asleep (somewhere on the directions it says you get the best results doing it that way) so far its been 4 days since i have had it on. it came out very dark like a mahogany reddish brown and is just beginning to fade. this a great product im still looking for a henna that last a month... if thats even possible. if your looking for henna that stays longer than a week and is very dark... THIS IS IT! :c)</li>
    <li> The kit is incredibly easy to use! My friends and I have had a blast using it. The shipping was very fast too!</li>
    <li> This kit simplifies the process of mixing and applying henna tattoos.  This particular kit requires no lemon juice or sugar!  You pour the bottle of solution into the bag of henna powder, mix it thoroughly, let it sit for 2 hours, then apply.  The kit comes with an applicator bottle and tip.  I allowed the henna to remain on my skin for 6 hours, which is the minimum recommended time, and it developed into a medium to deep reddish-brown color.  This is the darkest color I&#x27;ve ever gotten from using henna kits.  The reason I did not give the product a full 5 stars is because the applicator bottle can become tiring for your hands when using it for long periods of time.  But the positives of this product outweighs the negatives, and you can always use a different applicator.</li>
    <li> Read a lot of different reviews on what&#x27;s available through amazon, and decided to try this one. I had a henna tattoo done, and I wanted to refresh it.  The kit came with everything I needed along with some pretty good instructions (easier to read online) and tips.   I mixed the powder and liquid the night before, and left it in the fridge overnight. In the morning, I squeezed it into the bottle, and prepared a test tattoo. I used the oil included to use a stencil for practice with the applicator bottle. The oil did a fairly good job of transferring the stencil (more oil on the area made the stencil transfer darker) and I noticed the henna stuck better to the spots that I had used the oil.  When going over my previous henna, I was able to have a more steady hand from the previous practice.  Two small and one medium tattoo (with thick lines) used a little less than half of the applicator bottle, which appears to be able to be filled twice with what is mixed in the bag. I think the 30+ designs is a generous estimate, unless you&#x27;re using thin lines and small patterns.  The areas that had the oil stuck very well (about 12 hrs) before I scratched it off myself. The color started a brighter orange, but has turned a nice shade of red-brown (brighter color on my ankle, deeper brown on my shoulder).  Definitely recommending it to anyone who asks for a starter kit. I think the only thing left is to see how long it lasts in my super-cold fridge.    UPDATE 9/23/10:  I tried refreshing my tattoos after the henna had been in the fridge for 1 month, and all I got was a faint ornage tint that lasted about 2 or 3 days. Definitely keep the 1 month maximum life in mind when storing!!!</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoyed this product. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. The stencils provided allowed me to make great designs as a beginner. I was able to do it for my sisters as well and all of their friends wanted a henna tattoo too! The only problem I ran into was the tip getting clogged. It was simple to fix by rinsing or soaking it in hot water. The clogs would happen most often when the henna was still fairly cold (just after getting it out of the refrigerator). And the amount of henna you are given can honestly do 30 of the stencil designs. Tattoos were dark for about a week if the paste was left on for a solid six hours. The color deepened over 24 hours after removing the paste. The longer the paste stays on, the better the tattoo will be.</li>
    <li> Instructions are pretty simple and it&#x27;s fairly easy to use. For some reason I had to put a lot of pressure on the bottle for the henna to come out of the needle. Maybe it was me, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it lasted 4 days, then it started to fade. It&#x27;s almost gone now (6 days after the first application). It&#x27;s pretty, but I will not purchase again. Unfortunately I am allergic to it. I got a rash where I applied the Henna, on my wrist and it hasn&#x27;t gone away, probably because the henna is still visible. I am not faulting the product for my allergy, I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it states. BUT... it&#x27;s a fun product and for me personally, it would&#x27;ve been worth it, had I not developed an allergy to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U P D A T E:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the Henna wore off my wrist, the rash disappeared too. I had tried cortisone, anti-rash creams and nothing made it go away, except the fading of the Henna. Sorry, I really wish it had worked for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far for quick, easy, beautiful results. The quickest way is to buy pre made paste, but I&#x27;ve ALWAYS been disappointed. I just mix this up the night before I plan on using it (with the included solution) and it always turns out great. I also separated the powder and solution into 3-4 equal parts, because a small amount goes a long way. It lasts a long time, and the refills are a great price. The only henna product I&#x27;ll ever buy!</li>
    <li> My friend and I did a stay-over watching cheesy movies and doing Henna tattoos. The kit is easy and the instructions are good (even though we didn&#x27;t read them fully). I definitely recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16, 13, and 10 year old daughters. They love it and there is enough product for all 3 of them to reapply it at a few times to a large area. Easy for all 3 to use as it comes with specific directions and a good applicator. I will purchase again. Rated it 4 stars because the kids said it starts to fade in about 4 day depending on where you use it. This might be normal, but in any case, they saw it as a slight downside.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It gives all the supplies needed for a beginner interested in henna. It offers basic and clear directions, as well as a variety of stencils. The henna mixture also lasts for a long time if well taken care of. Definitely a great product!</li>
    <li> Bought this kit to touch-up a henna tattoo received while on vacation that was beginning to fade. Not sure if this product didn&#x27;t wok because of the existing henna on the skin, but it didn&#x27;t darken the areas we wanted to touch up, and then new areas we added on were pretty light compared to the \\&quot;authentic\\&quot; henna received on vacation. We&#x27;re disappointed!</li>
    <li> this product works very well, came on time, and was a lot of fun to use. stains on the skin very well. i recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for. An easy to follow kit, that had every thing I needed to start doing Henna body art in my business. I have tried others, and this is by far the BEST!  &lt;br /&gt;I even had a problem with my refill kit. The Henna wasn&#x27;t darkening, I wrote the company, they responded quickley,and replaced the kit at no charge. &lt;br /&gt;I will continue to do my business with this company, and their product.</li>
    <li> This kit includes everything you need to create henna tattoos and is great for henna artists of all levels. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. I particularly like the patterns on the stencil page (one pattern appears on the box cover). Overall, I enjoyed using this product and plan to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM, GREAT VALUE - we were so impressed on how many tattoos you get with this item, as well as you really don&#x27;t need to have artistic talent.  My 15 year old daughter got this for her and a group of friends to use and they had a blast and all the tattoos look great!  You really do want to wait as long as possible to shower/bathe as to not get the tattoos wet and have them last as long as possible.</li>
    <li> This is the second time i&#x27;ve ordered this product. I was disappointed that the refill kit and the original kit were the same price so I just got the original so I could have the extra stencils and squeeze bottle. The Stencils leave a nice dark pattern to follow if you use a bit more oil and press well. The tip on the squeeze bottle is great for all the stencil designs and the included tootpicks are good for spreading or removing henna depending on the design and your application. Just wish there were a few more tootpicks but those are easy to get at the grocery store. The color looked as it did in the picture on the palm. It does tend to look lighter in certain areas as they inform you in the literature provided.</li>
    <li> This kit overall is nice, but I had to give it so few stars because of the squeeze applicator bottle. You have to squeeze so hard to get the paste out that your hand will quickly start hurting. I would recommend buying henna cones. They&#x27;re much easier to use even when applying detailed designs and won&#x27;t tire your hand out so quickly!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying Mendhi so I bought this kit to see if it&#x27;s really for me.  In the instruction booklet, there is a recommendation to fill the dispenser tube with toothpaste to practice with because, according to whoever wrote it, the henna has the same consistency as toothpaste.  I did this and I had NO IDEA how freaking difficult it is to squeeze out a design!  I&#x27;m going to have to train (as in workout &amp; condition) my hands and fingers to do this.    I played with it as much as I could yesterday and, even though my hand is sore, did some earlier today.  I notice improvement in my hand strength already &amp; I&#x27;m looking forward to creating some great designs in the near future.    The package arrived quickly, in good condition with all parts included.</li>
    <li> The directions say to wait an hour before applying, i&#x27;d wait like three cos you get much better color. mine aren&#x27;t done oxidixing yet but i have a feeling they&#x27;re gonna turn out good. there&#x27;s A LOT of henna. when they say there&#x27;s enough for 20-30 designs, they mean it. it doesn&#x27;t look like a lot but it goes a long way. the tip broke within hours of starting to tattoo, but it&#x27;s still useable so it&#x27;s nbd. the transfers work great. it sucks that you can&#x27;t just print out your own designs and transfer them because it doesn&#x27;t work the same so don&#x27;t bother. i&#x27;ve found that color is most dark when it&#x27;s on my hands or feet, idk why. but simple to use, easy directions, worth the money for some fun!</li>
    <li> I wish it was easier to make smaller batches of it, so it would have lasted longer.  It was really nice and worked very well.</li>
    <li> I love this! It is amazing and the instructions are really easy to understand and follow! The only thing I hated was when I pored the solution in the cone bag (that you supply) I found out the bag was busted open on the side, so I lost a good amount of the power and solution. Over all I love this and think it is amazing! I would definitely recommend this to people.......and a different bag! ha ha!</li>
    <li> We got this for my 15 year old neice and it was her favorite Christmas gift.  They&#x27;re temporary &amp; fun.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 weeks ago.  I tried several techniques and wanted to post those as well.  This product is fantastic, gives a good dark stain, and is easy to use.  I have had my henna tattoos on for two weeks now and they are still a dark walnut color.  On one tattoo, I left the henna on overnight.  On one, I used a lemon and sugar mix several times to keep the henna moist.  One I rubbed off after six hours and one after only two hours.  They all came out the same color.  That&#x27;s amazing.  The one after two hours is fading a little faster than the others, but that is to be expected.  The only problems I had with this kit were user difficulty.  If stored properly, the Henna really does last.  I would recommend this product for anyone of any skill level.  I am a beginner and I have five gorgeous henna tattoos on me right now.  Great value for the cost.</li>
    <li> I loved this all-in-one kit and it was perfect for the two weeks that my 7 year old daughter was in recovery from a tonsillectomy. We mixed it up and did some mendhi before the surgery, and then added more \\&quot;tattoos\\&quot; every few days while she was recovering. Good product, a reasonable choice of design patterns are included. I still chose to use lemon-sugar mixture over the finished design, although the instructions say it isn&#x27;t necessary. Overall--everything you need to have an informal henna party.</li>
    <li> This is a great Henna kit. Very easy to follow instructions, and a few neat designs to use if you like. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is want to explore more with henna.</li>
    <li> This henna kit is a really great addition to a girl&#x27;s night in; last summer I used this with my daughter to create some really cool designs on her, ones inspired by the images in the packaging. Creates a very exotic look without a permanent commitment to a tattoo. Comes with everything you need to apply the henna and the directions were pretty clear and specific about how to get a good result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that drawing on skin is a little harder than I expected; I found it was a good idea to have a few extra drawing \\&quot;tools\\&quot; around to help - clean toothpicks are a good idea and some q-tips for blobs or where you change your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does takes its sweet time to dry/set up so having a movie/dvd handy to pass the time is also a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with this purchase and recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the 1st time ive ever used Henna, but this made my experience great. The directions were easy and it made enough henna to do designs all over my body...literally. &#x3D;P The color probably would have lasted long if i hadn&#x27;t scrubbed it off but i had messed up on the design so it looked awkward.</li>
    <li> I never thought I could actually do henna! This henna is amazing! It darkens to a mahogany brown in about a day, and is just beautiful! The intructions are helpful and give you wonderful hints and tips, the stencils are a huge help when starting out too! I highly recomend this product for first time, and long time henna artists!</li>
    <li> If you want an easy to use, effective henna stain for your own personal use and you are allergy-free, then this is it. However, read the ingredients closely as it is not \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (contains disodium EDTA and benzyl alcohol) and also has several natural ingredients that are common allergens (walnut powder, citric acid). If you are using this as a professional artist, I&#x27;d be VERY careful about warning clients about potential for allergy.     Pros:    ** Pre-measured quantities to make perfect past consistency (easy to use)  ** All necessary materials provided  ** Dark color (my hands tend to take color less well typically yet I ended up with the same color pictured on the box)    Cons:    ** Not natural -- whenever I get such dark color on my hands, I get suspicious. Sure enough, there are chemicals in the product that serve to enhance the natural color (disodium EDTA is a penetration enhancer). My nieces have sensitive skin. In an effort to avoid the incredibly dangerous black henna that is sold at ethnic stores, I bought this. But I could&#x27;t use this on them either once I read the ingredients. I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for genuinely natural henna that is free of additives yet gives reliable color.  ** Many of the natural ingredients are likely to cause allergy.  ** Do NOT use anywhere near anyone with tree nut allergies as the powder contains walnuts. If any of the powder enters the air and gets inhaled, it could cause the person&#x27;s airway to close up and kill them. (If you don&#x27;t believe me, look up \\&quot;anaphylaxis\\&quot;)  ** Tiny amount of henna provided. I tend to make more traditional designs with filled in areas and decorate hands fully. There&#x27;s no way this could be used on more than 3-4 hands, max.  ** Expensive  ** Bottle provided is tiny and made my hand cramp when I used it -- and I have very small hands (wear child-sized rings)  ** Mixed henna cannot be fully transferred into container provided and it is awkward to store.    Overall -- I can&#x27;t say I recommend it because the cons outweigh the pros. If you buy it,  use it at your own risk and be sure to inform others of the ingredients before using it on them.    I agree that it&#x27;s a bit misleading for them to say it lasts 1-3 weeks. I&#x27;ve been using henna for 30+ years as it&#x27;s part of my culture/heritage. I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of henna lasting more than 10 days (and even then..only as a hint of color) and I&#x27;d say it normally lasts closer to 5 days. How long henna lasts has to do with how sweaty you are, how often you wash your hands, how deeply the stain set in the first place, etc.</li>
    <li> Hard to use, the applicator get clogged too easy. I&#x27;m not very happy with this one it just will not come out even. Results look bad. Maybe it was just a bad batch, to old I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m not happy with it.</li>
    <li> First of all I have to say, I am so glad I never went out and got a permanent tattoo. After about two days of having the henna designs on my forearm, I was bored of it. But I don&#x27;t blame the henna for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, onto the product. I was very happy with it. I followed the instructions book (yes, it is included, for the person who gave this one star and said it didn&#x27;t come with any), and then let it sit for the suggested 6 hours. I applied it, and so on. Once it&#x27;s applied, it says to leave it on for about 6 hours. The book says it&#x27;s similar to toothpaste, in consistency, and they&#x27;re right. After I applied it, it hardens and breaks up into smaller sections. However, it said to leave it, so I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not for long enough. I left it on for about 5 hours (it became increasingly irritating not being able to do things with my left arm and hand for fear of smearing it), and then scratched as much as I could off. And then I did something else the book recommended you don&#x27;t do. And that is not to get it wet for 12 hours. But I had to wash my hands after I scratched it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, After I scratched it off, it was a dull orange color. I went to sleep, and when I woke up, it was a bright orange. I was a little worried I hadn&#x27;t left it on long enough, and this was as dark as it was going to get. But again, the book was right. Over the next few days it went from a bright orange to a light brown, and then a darker brown. I also kept adding to my designs, and going over areas that I wanted darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands now, I can just make out the last of my designs where it was darkest, and it&#x27;s been three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for areas of application...I found that it works best on the forearm, and the palm area of the hands. I had intricate designs on the back of my hand, but I wash my hands often, so it came off quicker there (don&#x27;t get me wrong, it lasted for a good couple of weeks there, but without re-application it will fade faster...unless you don&#x27;t plan on bathing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was very happy and impressed with it, and I will be ordering more soon. My suggestions for it&#x27;s application is to have toothpicks and paper towels at hand. I kind of laughed at the inclusion of toothpicks in the kit, but I learned quickly that you will make mistakes, and make accidental smears that will need to be quickly taken care of.Overall, I was very happy and impressed with it, and I will be ordering more soon.

    <li> It arrived promptly. It was brand new and very useful. I would definitely recommend it for first time henna users</li>
    <li> This product was everything it was described as. It works great and the kit is extremely simple. It&#x27;s great for beginners. The only mixing that&#x27;s involved is taking the liquid it gives you and dumping it into the package of henna and mixing it together. Keep in mind, this isn&#x27;t something you can do right on the spot though. You must let it set for at least an hour after you&#x27;ve mixed it. After you mix it and put your design on, you must wait for it to dry which can take about 20 minutes, before you can really do anything around it. Then you have to leave it on there for preferably 3-4 hours to let the stain actually settle in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of this is news though, the guide was extremely informative and let you know everything you needed to know to get great henna stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stencils that come with it transfer over great with the Eucalyptus Oil, that comes with it (which in it of itself is expensive alone), however the stencils that come with it aren&#x27;t that attractive. The good news though, is that the oil that comes with it, can transfer any kind of stencil design as long as it&#x27;s printed with a toner printer (NOT inkjet) or can easily transfer over any kind of pen drawing. It&#x27;s very easy to transfer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage to the kit is the strength of the bag that the henna is mixed in. I found the back started ripping as I was trying to get the mixed henna into the small tube. The tube had a very small opening which made it difficult to get the henna to go in since it was creation suction. It ultimately resulted in a messy process just getting the henna into the tube. However once in, everything went like clockwork. Beautifully easy to draw stencils on with the tip that comes with the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, I must say that I am very satisfied with the product and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone interested in henna stains.</li>
    <li> She is currently covered in Henna.  I have no problem with this stuff.  Many of her friends use it too.  There&#x27;s some sitting in the fridge right now.  I would buy this again for her.  Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> First of all, the kit comes with NO instructions whatsoever.  I had to find directions on the website.      Next, the henna apparently is supposed to last a month, yet I used it a week after it was mixed and it created almost zero coloration.      You also have to mix all the henna at once, so unless you&#x27;re going to put 30 designs on yourself at the same time, it&#x27;s a complete waste for this expensive kit for one or two designs!      Also, my design lasted only five days, as opposed to the WEEKS advertised (and I&#x27;ve used henna before and it has lasted the weeks it was supposed to).      I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The henna was fresh and good quality. I kept leftover mix in the fridge for a month and retouched the \\&quot;tattoos\\&quot;. Worked best on palms, but I still have one on my belly (4 weeks!). I put henna on in the evening and left it on all evening and overnight. Loved it.</li>
    <li> My first henna product and it surpassed expectations.  We loved it and had lots of fun.  So far the tattoos have been on for over a week and are still looking great!  We tried to put them on areas that wouldn&#x27;t get much abuse and they haven&#x27;t even started to lighten yet.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews on the product prior to purchase and can say without hesitation that I experienced no problems with this kit whatsoever. The plastic bag the powder comes in will not rip if you cut enough of the tip off and twist it like a pastry bag. You will have to tape up the extra as it doesn&#x27;t all fit in the bottle, but that&#x27;s no real issue. There is more than enough for many large sized tattoos, as I wear a size 11 shoe, covered my entire foot in an intricate pattern, did my wrist, and the bottle is 3/4 full. I didn&#x27;t use the transfers the kit comes with as I free-handed my design. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this kit.  Loved that it allowed me to make small intricate designs, but also large ones.  The henna design lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve seen some cheap henna out there, but this is top quality stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> The henna stains excellently, it was amazing! However, I rated this 3 stars for a reason. Reason being is the technical aspects of the product. The metal tip did mess up. It was clogged at first with the henna product, so I rinsed it and used a needle to clear out the tip. Still, it clogged up or would spurt out thick lines of henna that messed up my design. Another negative aspect was the transfer stencils. I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t work for me because it forced me to design henna on my own with confidence, however the oil and stencils are horrid. The oil will mess up the stencil, regardless of how you apply it, and it will mess up while applied to your hand if its not removed properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you accidentally freeze your henna, throw it away and purchase some more. I accidentally froze my henna(I was hit with Sandy and my freezer was the last place that was cool)by forgetting it was in the freezer. The henna stain will only last for maximum 4 days without routine washing of body part. (Rinsing will preserve henna). However, its best if you just get rid of it and purchase new henna, you save your self time with having to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I have medium to dark skin(suede 470 in lancome foundation), and this product showed up beautifully. I will buy the REFILL kit, and my own bottles w/tips, but not the beginner kit.</li>
    <li> This kit is completely worth the price.  One could easily pay this amount for only one small design.  With this kit one may create dozens of tattoos.  Additionally, the expected life of the henna is surpassed, as the henna lasts for weeks if refridgerated (and air is removed from bottle properly).  Great idea for groups of children/parties!</li>
    <li> I love this Henna kit!! The only problem is that the paste doesn&#x27;t stick on your skin very well. It&#x27;s hard to get a dark design.</li>
    <li> Very cool. My girls love it. Lasts for a few days on skin. Allows them to be very creative.</li>
    <li> I have never played with henna before but this kit definitely made it very simple. I found the instructions to be very clear and easily understandable. The kit contains powder, solution to mix with powder, a bottle and tip to apply it to your skin, reusable stencils (directions said they can be used up to six times...and I&#x27;d belief that), eucalyptus oil, toothpick and q-tips. You mix the powder with the solution and let it sit for ~2 hours. Then you put it into the bottle for application. To transfer a stencil, you cut out the stencil you want from the sheet of paper, apply a little eucalyptus oil where you want the stencil to go, press it on (kind of like those old fake tattoos you&#x27;d get in crackjack boxes) and start applying the henna. I found that the transfer of the stencil worked better if you used more eucalyptus oil. You need to let the henna dry on your skin for at least 6 hours. I did it before bed, then wrapped the area in saran wrap for the night. In the morning, I scrapped off the dried henna and used vegetable oil to clean off any residue (per the directions). Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results. I did a design on my feet and one on the palm of my hand. The one on my palm is VERY dark compared to my feet. I had been intimidated by the idea of doing mehndi on myself, but this kit was exactly what I needed to get over my \\&quot;henna fear\\&quot;. The only thing that I wasn&#x27;t so thrilled about is the size of the bottle used for application. The bottle is MUCH smaller than the amount of henna paste that is mixed. I didn&#x27;t have a container to store rest of the henna paste so ended throwing out about a third of it. That is after doing two feet and a hand.</li>
    <li> Worst henna kit ever. The bottle with the applicator kept getting blocked and it was a complete waste of time and money...the kit itself was cool and easy to put together, but that applicator was wack...</li>
    <li> I became curious about Henna after getting a Henna body painting done on vacation. I didn&#x27;t know much about how the Henna process works, and I wanted the easiest way to start. This kit has easy to follow instructions, and it worked well for me... I did make a little bit of a mess because I rubbed part of a painting off walking by my sofa ... lol ... Bonus, my boyfriend let me practice on him while he was watching football... I honestly felt like a little kid playing with a new toy. I had a lot of fun and laughs at my drawings that didn&#x27;t come out as well as planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived really fast. I am very satisfied with this product and seller.</li>
    <li> I purchased this body painting kit for my daughter&#x27;s 12th birthday, and she decided to make it an activity at her birthday party. All seven girls got tattoos, some did them on each other, I helped with a few of the more complicated ones. The decals were helpful, though some of the girls wanted their own designs. There was enough henna for each of the girls to have 2 tattoos, with enough left over to do at least one more each (the leftover henna refrigerates for up to 4 weeks).    Only thing to watch out for is that some people are sensitive to the eucalyptis oil. Make sure their skin doesn&#x27;t react to it before you do their tattoo. Auric Blends&#x27; customer service person, Danielle, was terrific help in making sure this arrived in time for the party. All in all, a great experience... you should try it out!</li>
    <li> This was the exact product that I expected and it was shipped super quickly. Loved it and it was perfect!</li>
    <li> The Henna never got really dark on my skin, just a chocolate brown color.  It does last for about a week.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Purchase for teenager as present. I did inspect the box when it arrived and all items are included as listed in advertisement. Have no idea yet how it will look when put to use but I don&#x27;t see why it won&#x27;t work since ingredients have been commonly known to produce good henna results by users for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would suggest 2 dispenser bottles and a little more ingredients for the price though.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its very easy to do and it lasts for weeks! Its dark brown and shows up even on dark skin. Love, Love, Love!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s 12th birthday.  We used it with great results.  according to the instructions we saved the rest in the refrigerator and 4 weeks later we used the remaining and it worked even better with great color.  I am not a fan of tatoos but this is temporary so it is the best of both worlds.</li>
    <li> perfect gift for my 15 year old cousin. this is close to the real stuff, stained dark and quickly and lasted for a week +</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. The instructions are really easy to follow and the tattoo stays on for about 2 to 3 weeks.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t love were the patterns.</li>
    <li> Not the best but OK for the money.  Far from real looking tattoo and failed to stay on very long.</li>
    <li> I took all the measures for best results but it really doesn&#x27;t show and it starts to fade only a few days after. The &amp;#34;14&amp;#34; days that it will take, is a lie. Only remnants of it last that long. The color is very light and takes HOURS for it to have any effect and you have to be extremely careful or it chips off. Really not worth it. Just get a real tattoo or a kids&#x27; tattoo. Either of those would do better.</li>
    <li> I bought the Henna Kit for my daughter and she has struggled to get the ink to flow out through the metal head of the bottle.  We have tired clearing it with pins etc...nothing has worked. It has not been fun, only frustrating!  And it was not cheap for what we got!</li>
    <li> I ordered this just to experiment because it was my first time using henna ever. Overall I like the product the instructions are easy to follow and the designs it comes with are simple but useful if you&#x27;re a beginner. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like much was that it doesn&#x27;t last for a couple weeks in my case it only lasted about 1 week and it fades out very quickly, meaning it only looks good for about 3 or 4 days. I think its a cheap product and you get what you&#x27;re paying for but if you&#x27;re looking to do a design for a special event or you want good quality definitely try something else.</li>
    <li> Got it for our 11 year old. She loves it. My 21 year old did one also. Seems to be plenty of ingredients for quite a few more.</li>
    <li> Love the product, easy to use and each one stayed only a week.  Product was for my niece and she was in haven when she got it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my ex-girlfreind while we were still a thing, from her reaction Im assuming this product met her expectations so going off that I will give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I received my henna kit 2 days earlier and finally got to try it out last night. I mixed it up and followed the instructions which were very easy to understand. I left it on overnight (7 hours) and this morning the color was a nice golden brown. the only problem i saw was that the picture on the back of the box of the kit was wrong. it showed a lot more green powder then what i got and showed the applicator bottle wrong. otherwise it was great. planning on doing more!</li>
