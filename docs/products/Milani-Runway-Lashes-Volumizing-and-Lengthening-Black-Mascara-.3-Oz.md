      <li>*Original Review*  </li>
      <li>This product is not new to the market, but I&#x27;ve never considered Milani mascaras before until I saw great reviews online for this one.  </li>
      <li>Also, I would only stick to two coats at most because any more would also probably cause clumping.  </li>
      <li>The color is a very nice, rich, matte black.  </li>
      <li>As a makeup junkie I am always excited at trying new products and looking for the next great thing.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend using this, especially if you are used to using a brand like Maybelline which did an excellent job of making my eye lashes look super long and full.</li>
      <li>and I think that despite having a cheap price, this mascara really packs a punch.  </li>
      <li>This one is my favorite thus far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I was just playing around with it and didn&#x27;t have any eye makeup on because it would have completely ruined it.</li>
      <li>Like, my lashes look so much longer, full, and noticeable when I use this product.</li>
      <li>Anyway I really love how big, bold, and long this makes my lashes and find myself reaching for it more than others.  </li>
      <li>Okay, so after leaving this product alone for about a week or so and then going back to it, I feel like bumping this up to HG status.  </li>
      <li>No dramatic in eyelash  lengths.</li>
      <li>Runway Lashes does give pretty decent volume and length.  </li>
      <li>Very clumpy and way to much product on brush</li>
      <li>This mascara really does bring out the lashes and make thing stand out and flare.</li>
      <li>Did not create much volume or curl..</li>
      <li>Works great for my straight thin lashes.</li>
      <li>My lashes are straight with medium length, but very fine and blonde and can barely be seen without makeup.  </li>
      <li>Pretty decent volume and length, minimal clumping, no smudging and flaking, plus free from parabens, all for $4??  </li>
      <li>And I had high hopes for this one.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this mascara.</li>
      <li>It makes my eyelashes look so full and long!</li>
      <li>Better than several far more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>And my lashes stay soft.  </li>
      <li>I would rather pay a few extra dollars and get a more quality product.</li>
      <li>This mascara leaves clumps all over your lashes and puts on way too much mascara with one application and felt my eye lashes looked shorter and less full than they have with any other mascara.</li>

<li> This mascara leaves clumps all over your lashes and puts on way too much mascara with one application and felt my eye lashes looked shorter and less full than they have with any other mascara.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t have any major clumping, but I could tell that I do have to apply this carefully otherwise my lashes will stick together.  </li>
<li> When applied slowly, in several coats, your lashes get so long</li>
<li> While my lashes don&#x27;t look like falsies, this mascara does leave a big impact and gives a more dramatic look rather than an everyday look.  </li>
<li> Really no different from any other mascara.</li>
<li> but it makes them stand out and look so long !</li>
<li> The brush is inferior &amp; my lashes don&#x27;t look much different with or without it, except a little darker.  </li>
<li> I expected-</li>
<li> but it is extremely flaky.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY different mascara&#x27;s &amp; this is the WORST!  </li>
<li> Not sure what planet some of the other &amp;#34;4 &amp; 5 Star Review&amp;#34; customers are on.  </li>
<li> I saw this mascara reviewed by a few youtubers and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
<li> I think the formula dried out just a smidge since opening which I prefer.  </li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> sorry to say and ended back with my usual Mac mascara instead.</li>
<li> but it was too late according to the seller.</li>
<li> Smears badly , lashes long though and longer used with &amp;#34; hard candy &amp;#34; fiber primer .</li>
<li> Almost like it was too thin and couldn&#x27;t cling on to my lashes as I kept trying to apply it.</li>
<li> Just like any ordinary mascara...kind of disappointed.</li>
<li> it looks like you are wearing false eyelashes!</li>
<li> but it flakes off like crazy.  </li>
<li> Was very disappointed as it did not thicken or lengthen my lashes at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This mascara really does bring out the lashes and make thing stand out and flare. Like, my lashes look so much longer, full, and noticeable when I use this product. Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mascara from Walgreens.  I thought I would love it but it flakes off like crazy.  By the end of the day its mostly all off my lashes.  I would rather pay a few extra dollars and get a more quality product.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  I know some of the reviews say it flakes off, but mine does not.</li>
    <li> Love this! Doesn&#x27;t clump, and adds a ton of volume and length to my laces.</li>
    <li> Not sure what planet some of the other &amp;#34;4 &amp; 5 Star Review&amp;#34; customers are on.  I&#x27;ve tried MANY different mascara&#x27;s &amp; this is the WORST!  The brush is inferior &amp; my lashes don&#x27;t look much different with or without it, except a little darker.  I guess we sometimes get what we pay for.</li>
    <li> pretty good mascara. i LOVE how it looks on my lashes but it is extremely flaky.</li>
    <li> Ugh, I did not care for this mascara at all. It was probably the messiest one I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m glad I was just playing around with it and didn&#x27;t have any eye makeup on because it would have completely ruined it. And I had high hopes for this one. :/</li>
    <li> Currently my favorite mascara! It makes my eyelashes look so full and long!</li>
    <li> Really no different from any other mascara. No dramatic in eyelash  lengths.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! Works great for my straight thin lashes. Surprisingly it curls my lashes really well. I would repurchase it again.</li>
    <li> The absolute best mascara, I have really light lashes and not as much but it makes them stand out and look so long !</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I heard about it on a video blog and decided to try it. When applied slowly, in several coats, your lashes get so long it looks like you are wearing false eyelashes! It is the perfect black and doesn&#x27;t wipe off unless you use eye make-up remover. I would highly recommend this mascara.</li>
    <li> Smears badly , lashes long though and longer used with &amp;#34; hard candy &amp;#34; fiber primer . I get compliments on my lashes .</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give the length I expected- but I&#x27;ll use it anyway</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascara but this 1 is a must buy.. :) My friends and family ask if i&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes....I recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find some different mascara for a while. This one is my favorite thus far. I do, however, wish that they gave a bit more of a volumizing look.</li>
    <li> Just like any ordinary mascara...kind of disappointed. Did not create much volume or curl..</li>
    <li> I saw a British makeup artist on Youtube who said this stuff was the greatest. Imo it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed as it did not thicken or lengthen my lashes at all. Almost like it was too thin and couldn&#x27;t cling on to my lashes as I kept trying to apply it. I ended up throwing it away sorry to say and ended back with my usual Mac mascara instead.</li>
    <li> I saw this mascara reviewed by a few youtubers and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I love Love LOVE this mascara! Better than several far more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Lengthens. Thickens. Separates. And my lashes stay soft.  No spider eyes.  I wish it was water proof.</li>
    <li> Very clumpy and way to much product on brush</li>
    <li> *UPDATE*  Okay, so after leaving this product alone for about a week or so and then going back to it, I feel like bumping this up to HG status.  I actually like it better than the Lash Sensational from Maybelline that I gave five stars and thought I liked best out of all my recently bought mascaras.  I think the formula dried out just a smidge since opening which I prefer.  Anyway I really love how big, bold, and long this makes my lashes and find myself reaching for it more than others.  It still has that awesome staying power with no smudging or flaking and I will definitely be purchasing this again and again.  Just a bonus that the price is so cheap!  *Original Review*  As a makeup junkie I am always excited at trying new products and looking for the next great thing.  This product is not new to the market, but I&#x27;ve never considered Milani mascaras before until I saw great reviews online for this one.  I picked it up in Kmart for around $4 and I think that despite having a cheap price, this mascara really packs a punch.  My lashes are straight with medium length, but very fine and blonde and can barely be seen without makeup.  A mascara that makes me happy is one that volumizes and defines my lashes, and length is always a nice bonus.  Runway Lashes does give pretty decent volume and length.  While my lashes don&#x27;t look like falsies, this mascara does leave a big impact and gives a more dramatic look rather than an everyday look.  The color is a very nice, rich, matte black.  I didn&#x27;t have any major clumping, but I could tell that I do have to apply this carefully otherwise my lashes will stick together.  Also, I would only stick to two coats at most because any more would also probably cause clumping.  My skin and eyelids are oily, but I&#x27;m so impressed that I didn&#x27;t experience any smudging (or flaking), even though it is now very hot and humid here in the southern US.  Even with it&#x27;s all day wear I was able to remove it easily with an oil-free makeup remover.  So, final verdict.  Pretty decent volume and length, minimal clumping, no smudging and flaking, plus free from parabens, all for $4??  Yes, it&#x27;s possible with Runway Lashes from Milani.  While I wouldn&#x27;t call this an HG product for me, I must say I&#x27;m impressed with how well this product performed.  I&#x27;d definitely say give this a try if you&#x27;re looking to change up your mascara routine.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a mascara to use that doesnt test on animals to replace my Maybelline mascaras that I LOVED. I have tried several different brands, and thought I would give this one a try. This mascara leaves clumps all over your lashes and puts on way too much mascara with one application and felt my eye lashes looked shorter and less full than they have with any other mascara. I tried to return it but it was too late according to the seller. I would not recommend using this, especially if you are used to using a brand like Maybelline which did an excellent job of making my eye lashes look super long and full.</li>
    <li> Comes on smoothly, looks great! Possibly my new favorite mascara!</li>
