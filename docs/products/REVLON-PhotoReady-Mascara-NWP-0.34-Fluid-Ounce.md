      <li>My favorite mascara!great length and volume.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara...</li>
      <li>Pretty good mascara for the price.</li>
      <li>It took about 8 good coats before I really felt like I had any on.</li>
      <li>Thank you Revlon for bringing back a mascara that wears and looks absolutely gorgeous with the longest, smoothest lashes ever!othest lashes ever!</li>
      <li>When it came to washing this mascara off, it was so easy to remove with just soap and water.</li>
      <li>This finely bristled brush with it&#x27;s rounded end doesn&#x27;t miss a lash.</li>
      <li>I was less impressed.</li>
      <li>The best way to remove it is to use makeup remover and cotton round.</li>
      <li>I bought it primarily to add some drama to my night time</li>
      <li>It was good mascara, with good volume, but it dried out too quickly.</li>
      <li>From the minute I put this new Revlon PhotoReady mascara on, I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>A light hand is all I need because it goes on quick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but you have to be careful</li>
      <li>Love the brush, really separates your lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
      <li>It dries quickly, gives great coverage with minimal application.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, clumps just the right amount to make lashes appear thicker, and lengthens beyond believe.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely thrilled to have my old Revlon mascara back on my lashes- especially one that goes on this perfect!</li>
      <li>IDK if I use a lot of it or if it drys out quickly.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything magical to my lashes but they look decent with it on.</li>
      <li>I have found my new favorite mascara.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite.  </li>
      <li>the brush brush make a perfect application it also is long lasting.</li>
      <li>I always get asked if my eye lashes are real!!</li>
      <li>This is definitely the more affordable version and I will be buying again soon!</li>
      <li>No clumps, smooth, glossy and really extends the lashes.</li>
      <li>Beats any Covergirl mascara and also my old favorite, Maybelline&#x27;s Stiletto.</li>
      <li>Its the only product that has ever helped with my kind of lashes.</li>
      <li>I have super straight lashes and every time I test out a different kind of mascara they don&#x27;t seem to help in any way, I curl my lashes before I put on mascara</li>
      <li>I look forward to seeing if it works better once it dries up a little bit more.</li>
      <li>The brush is unusually shaped and firm, which works great for me.</li>
      <li>When I first tried this mascara</li>
      <li>i threw this out after the first day..</li>
      <li>the first thing i noticed about using it was how well it defined my lashes.</li>
      <li>so I use a heavier waterproof one on really hot days.</li>
      <li>I would compare it to Benefit&#x27;s \\&quot;They&#x27;re Real\\&quot; Mascara which is my other favorite!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I love that they use a nice thick wax in their formula for a super smooth, dark look.</li>
      <li>I turned to L&#x27;Oreal and found their new telescopic explosion mascara to be much better than anything Revlon has made for over the past 10 years or more.</li>
      <li>Love the mascara and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>The color (I chose blackest black) is really nice and dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really inexpensive and works like a charm, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
      <li>The formula is very runny</li>
      <li>They hit my sunglasses, I get complements, and my husband really likes the look.</li>
      <li>the volume has to be built by layering it - but it does not clump (with a reasonable number of layers of course)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>and i always have the problem with them going straight again, so</li>
      <li>Revlon&#x27;s new PhotoReady is exactly that.</li>
      <li>I know that all mascaras have liquid tendencies to them, but this one seems to be even more liquidy than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>If you have super straight lashes and have the same problem as I do, then I highly suggest you get this!</li>
      <li>This is hands down my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s just more money going down the drain for me.</li>
      <li>Although the brush is a little large for my eyes, I love the length it offers</li>
      <li>The mascara is super smooth, yet thick, with no clumps or flaking.</li>
      <li>I got this in a kit when I lived in New Zealand.</li>
      <li>I saw the wand has a really finely detailed long brush end with the actual end rounded like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s globe ended brush.</li>
      <li>I had to try this new brush, as it looked perfect, but I also hoped the mascara itself was improved from their dry, clumpy, dull color mascara from the past.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really liked it not too clumpy</li>
    <li> This mascara is wonderful. I wasnt expecting a plastic brush but once I got used to it I like it. It makes my lashes look great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Revlon products since the 70&#x27;s, especially their mascara and eyeliner. (In the 60&#x27;s- I only used Yardley- how I miss those perfect eye products!) For the past couple decades, I have found Revlon&#x27;s many different types of mascara to be really bad- dull color, flaky, clumpy, dry and thin. I turned to L&#x27;Oreal and found their new telescopic explosion mascara to be much better than anything Revlon has made for over the past 10 years or more. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s applicator wand has the new teensy round flexi-globe brush that covers your lashes quite well, but the teensy size brush does take time to cover your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was looking through the different new mascara&#x27;s, I noticed this new Revlon PhotoReady mascara. I saw the wand has a really finely detailed long brush end with the actual end rounded like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s globe ended brush. I had to try this new brush, as it looked perfect, but I also hoped the mascara itself was improved from their dry, clumpy, dull color mascara from the past. From the minute I put this new Revlon PhotoReady mascara on, I was thrilled. The applicator has the best brush I have ever used! This finely bristled brush with it&#x27;s rounded end doesn&#x27;t miss a lash. The mascara is super smooth, yet thick, with no clumps or flaking. The color (I chose blackest black) is really nice and dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like my mascara dark and smooth to make long, lush lashes to stand out from my eye liner. Revlon&#x27;s new PhotoReady is exactly that. After decades of bad mascara, Revlon has finally made a PERFECT mascara. I love that they use a nice thick wax in their formula for a super smooth, dark look. When it came to washing this mascara off, it was so easy to remove with just soap and water. I do not use the waterproof type, and this doesn&#x27;t smudge or run. I am absolutely thrilled to have my old Revlon mascara back on my lashes- especially one that goes on this perfect! Thank you Revlon for bringing back a mascara that wears and looks absolutely gorgeous with the longest, smoothest lashes ever!othest lashes ever!</li>
    <li> This is some of the worst mascara I have ever used.  It did absolutely nothing, in fact it may have even made it look like I had less eye lashes.</li>
    <li> I must say I am highly disappointed with this product. No impressive volume or length, just horrible flaking. I have never used a mascara that was flaking as bad as this one. At first I thought it was due to a primer I use before putting on mascara. I tried both ways, with and without the primer and both times I ended up with horrible residue under my eyes after 2 hour wear. Bad product! Not a revlon mascara I would recommend to anyone unless you like having mascara flakes all over your face.</li>
    <li> I liked it. Nothing extreme.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this type of wand but It looks nice!</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing I look like I have&lt;br /&gt;Dolls eyes when I use this. u gotta try it u will like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mascara junkie and have been using this for the last 3 years.  love it! I do have to buy two at a time though. IDK if I use a lot of it or if it drys out quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the blackest mascara i have ever used and the first thing i noticed about using it was how well it defined my lashes. the volume has to be built by layering it - but it does not clump (with a reasonable number of layers of course)</li>
    <li> This is probably my least favorite mascara that I have tried in a few months. I bought it primarily to add some drama to my night time look for going out and was not very impressed. The brush was a good shape and style, but the formula just did not do it for me. It took about 8 good coats before I really felt like I had any on. Ended up using the whole tube but even still did not give the dramatic results I was hoping for</li>
    <li> This does not volumize-it lengthens; however, it flakes like crazy. It won&#x27;t last all day at work, and for me, it caused a terrible reaction. For some this may not be a problem, but it wasn&#x27;t even a little itchy. My eyes started burning and my they became so red my husband thought I had been sobbing hysterically-not very attractive. Regardless of the allergy, it is not very flattering. \\&quot;Photo ready\\&quot; should make your eyes pop, and this is just not good at all. I was enticed by the brush as well, but this is a let down.</li>
    <li> I have super straight lashes and every time I test out a different kind of mascara they don&#x27;t seem to help in any way, I curl my lashes before I put on mascara and i always have the problem with them going straight again, so that&#x27;s just more money going down the drain for me. But not with this mascara! If you have super straight lashes and have the same problem as I do, then I highly suggest you get this! Its the only product that has ever helped with my kind of lashes. It&#x27;s really inexpensive and works like a charm, you won&#x27;t regret it. Hope this helps :-)</li>
    <li> the brush is wonderful, but at the end of the day i look like a panda bear, it watered. the page says that it is waterproof and it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is ok but I would not purchase it again. It is a little clumpy but not bad. The brush is ok but not great. It didn&#x27;t do anything magical to my lashes but they look decent with it on. I like that it washes off well too.</li>
    <li> a friend gave me this mascara as a gift it is awesome!!!! the brush brush make a perfect application it also is long lasting. i&#x27;m  so happy I found it online!!!</li>
    <li> I really love the brush on this mascara, it&#x27;s super great for lengthening lashes. However, when you take the brush from the product you MUST wipe off all the excess mascara you can, otherwise your lashes will turn into clumpy disasters. Also, make sure to look down while applying because if you don&#x27;t, this will completely ruin the eyeshadow you worked so hard on. I know that all mascaras have liquid tendencies to them, but this one seems to be even more liquidy than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s a great product, but you have to be careful</li>
    <li> I have used the pricier brands and they just don&#x27;t deliver. I have long, straight, thin lashes, and this mascara makes me look like I have falsies on. They hit my sunglasses, I get complements, and my husband really likes the look. A light hand is all I need because it goes on quick. I like to wear it with Urban Decay 24/7 Glide On Pencil in a black or similiar shade. Revlon eyeliners aren&#x27;t very good.</li>
    <li> This is very first mascara that does not give me the black shadow under my eye.  I decided to go cheaper and see what would happen.  I tried this one and another one.  The other one...no go...this one....WORKS.  I was completely surprised.  I always spend money for the expensive ones and they still never work.  I have found my new favorite mascara.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love the mascara and it was exactly what I expected. I&#x27;ve bought this mascara before but think I received the non-waterproof kind which is something to keep in mind...Anyway this mascara is my favorite, it separates and elongates my lashes without clumping. I would compare it to Benefit&#x27;s \\&quot;They&#x27;re Real\\&quot; Mascara which is my other favorite! This is definitely the more affordable version and I will be buying again soon! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale at my local grocer for $3. This is pretty much the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought. It doesn&#x27;t lengthen, it&#x27;s clumpy and it doesn&#x27;t come off. I use soap to wash makeup off of my eyes and never had a problem until now. And if you get the stuff anywhere BUT your lashes? It&#x27;s NOT coming off. This product is poor when it comes to what I look for in a mascara considering my short, thin lashes. Unless you cry often, or your eyes get sweaty, or you don&#x27;t plan to wash your face for a few days, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I heard wonderful things about this mascara and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m going back to my trusty Lorael Voluminous. It was good mascara, with good volume, but it dried out too quickly.</li>
    <li> I hate this mascara. It clumps worse than any mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I realize that it is waterproof but I cannot get it all cleaned off after washing my face and using eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Pretty good mascara for the price. It has good color, adds volume, and you can re-apply without clumping.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara!great length and volume. I always get asked if my eye lashes are real!! Definitely a must try.</li>
    <li> it is so flaky and hard to apply - it took 2 days to finally get my lashes clean even with makeup remover..i threw this out after the first day..</li>
    <li> My new favorite.  It dries quickly, gives great coverage with minimal application.  It does not flake or leave dots under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump.  I gave this one a try an really liked it.  It is a good value on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best Mascara in the world! I&#x27;ve been using this for years! So glad I found it online!</li>
    <li> I got this in a kit when I lived in New Zealand. It was a pleasant surprise, it&#x27;s a great daily mascara for just messing around. I tend to sweat on my face quite profusely so I use a heavier waterproof one on really hot days. Still, a good one for regular, casual use. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product may have been old, it didn&#x27;t wear well, it smudged on my upper eye lid as well as below my eye.</li>
    <li> The mascara is really black and makes my eyelashes look long and thick. I get asked if my eyelashes are fake since i&#x27;ve been using this mascara, it&#x27;s affordable and it works great!</li>
    <li> I hate this stuff. It makes my lashes look very spread apart and thin. I love volume and thick eyelashes and this just doesn&#x27;t do it.  It also rubs off on my brow bone because I have combo skin. I have never had that happen with other mascaras. I guess maybe use water food if you wan this and have combo to oily skin.</li>
    <li> This mascara both lengthens and volumizes your eyelashes. I recommend this to all of my friends. It will always be my favorite!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara...too bad they are discontinuing it...but, it lenghthens and volumizes and lasts all day.  I now just have to buy online.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the rave reviews, and I agree 100%!!! Awesome, dark, doesn&#x27;t fade, doesn&#x27;t lose pigment, doesnt flake, doesn&#x27;t clump (which is HUGE)!!!! Not to mention how incredibly well it accentuates my lashes! LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite mascara. It&#x27;s smooth, clumps just the right amount to make lashes appear thicker, and lengthens beyond believe. This is all I&#x27;m using form here on out. Beats any Covergirl mascara and also my old favorite, Maybelline&#x27;s Stiletto.</li>
    <li> Horrible product.  Flakes off of your lashes all day long, and gets into your eyes.  It makes you look like a raccoon 2 hours after you put it on.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara. The brush is unusually shaped and firm, which works great for me.</li>
    <li> This mascara is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used. No clumps, smooth, glossy and really extends the lashes. The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t just wash off with soap, like I&#x27;ve done with other mascara types. The best way to remove it is to use makeup remover and cotton round.</li>
    <li> Love the brush, really separates your lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump.  I know it&#x27;s a volumizing mascara but for me it also adds some length.  Doesn&#x27;t flake off even after wearing it all day.  2 coats is all I need to make my eyes pop.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t ever purchase this again, it&#x27;s hard to put on, it&#x27;s not thick and you can barely tell it&#x27;s even on.</li>
    <li> Goes on perfectly without clumping. I can apply additional coats to build it up without any problems.</li>
    <li> I like this product. There is no clumping and it can last long but it&#x27;s not waterproof.  I was worried about quality /the price was much less than the local store price/, but it was fine. Very satisfied with those mascara.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this mascara I was very impressed, I used it over my existing mascara as a second coat. But once I tried it by itself I was less impressed. The formula is very runny so I suppose I&#x27;ll have to wait a little bit until it dries up a tad. It didn&#x27;t clump, per say, but when the formula makes your lashes that wet they do tend to stick together. The brush is amazing and has the dome tip at the end of it. I look forward to seeing if it works better once it dries up a little bit more.</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing. Although the brush is a little large for my eyes, I love the length it offers and I love how the brush separates my eye lashes. It gives my eye lashes a natural appearance. It also lasts a very long time. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or causes clumps. I will definitely repurchase this mascara sometime soon.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t seem like the bottle lasts very long even only applying it once a day, but maybe that is all mascara...</li>
    <li> There is nothing to dislike about this product, and I DO check out different mascaras.  It has to be able to be removed with soap and water, and I won&#x27;t pay a fortune.  This product is FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; service</li>
