<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice cleanser, just use little while taking a bath or during washing face. No side effects noticed. Well packaged and shipped.  A sample was sent for r3eview purposes. Bonus it is organic!</li>
    <li> This cleanser works great on my skin. It clears the pores and takes all the residue of makeup, dirt, dust etc out. It gives my skin a youthful and healthy glow. The rose hip oil and Vitamin E are best ingredients for healthy skin. The cleanser is great for the sensitive skin. It has no scent at all. It helps in reducing blackheads. It is very gentle on your skin. I feel my skin is very clean and fresh after I use this cleanser. Due to the rich ingredients it does not dry my skin after use. Rose hip oil is great for repairing the skin. So it is perfect for the any skin type.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this Facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to try this facial cleanser on a promotional discount to give an unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Face feels very clean without feeling tight or dry.</li>
    <li> I was contacted and asked if I would give an honest opinion of this product. I will not receive any money for this review, and I don&#x27;t respond to offers of merchandise for positive reviews. So here goes....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-smells good. It has a very faint scent, and the best descriptor I can think of is that it smells clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-doors a VERY good job at getting everything off my face. Oil, dirt, sweat, makeup, it&#x27;s all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-will last a long time. I use an electric brush and two drops are plenty for my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-does an excellent job of preparing my face for both my day and night skin regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-has never made my face break out, which has happened in the past, especially with products that are very thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is probably the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. One BIG POINT I want to make, however, is that it is important to use an appropriate (for your skin type) moisturizer after cleaning your face with this. It will leave your skin very clean and will not in and of itself dry you out, but the air and all the unhealthy things that may be in it should be locked out if you want to have great skin later. I can definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It over dried my combo-oily acne prone skin causing my skin to get cystic acne and to get irritated . In addition, in here it doesnt fully list the ingredients of the cleanser, as it does in the packaging.  Very disappointed since its not a cheap cleanser. Hope I could get a refund  :(</li>
    <li> The two key ingredients in OZ Naturals&#x27; Ocean Mineral Cleanser are rose hip oil and Vitamin E. According to my research:&lt;br /&gt;* Do a quick search on rose hip oil (like I did because I had never heard of it prior to the use of this product), and you will find that it has been dubbed a skin care superstar. Rich in fatty acids and antioxidants, rose hip oil is said to promote healthy skin cell rejuvenation, reduce the appearance of dark spots and aging spots, and improve complexion problems such as dryness, eczema, and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;* Vitamin E has long been used and recommended for its antioxidant properties and providing protection against UV radiation and other free radicals. It is said to decrease skin roughness, length of facial lines, and wrinkle depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals combines both of these skin care rockstars--rose hip oil and Vitamin E--in the Ocean Mineral Facial Cleanser.  Packaged in flip-cap tube, the cleanser is clear with a light scent. I found that I only needed a small amount, so the product will definitely last awhile. It rinsed off cleanly and left my skin feeling clear and refreshed. According to the packaging, the Ocean Mineral Facial Cleanser is 72% organic and made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who frequently breaks out from skin care products, I was pleased to find that I experienced no breakouts from the Ocean Mineral Facial Cleanser. Yet perhaps the best testament to this product (and the other OZ Naturals products I have been using--please see my other reviews if you are interested) came just a few days ago, when someone asked me, \\&quot;What have you been using on your skin? Your face looks fantastic!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about a month now and it&#x27;s probably one of the best facial cleansers that I&#x27;ve used - it&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t leave residue like normal soap might, but it also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I keep it in the shower and use it as part of my daily routine - about a dime-sized worth of cleaner is enough to foam up just enough to clean my full face and neck. My skin has been clear and healthy looking since I started using this, so that&#x27;s a major bonus!  The one thing that I wish it had was some sort of exfoliating element in the cleanser itself so that I didn&#x27;t have to use two separate products, but that&#x27;s not a hassle enough to mark down a review for this great product.</li>
    <li> It leaves my face smooth and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the way it lathers and works with my Clarisonic, but if it gets in my eyes it burns.  This is the first facial wash that has done so.  Not sure I will reorder again. Kind of disappointed, because I brought the whole product line.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this facial cleanser since I was running very low on my favorite cleanser. I never intended for this to replace my old one.... Until I tried it! I use a Clarisonic so it&#x27;s important that I have something that is smooth and also bubbles up (personal preference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I obviously did was smell it- it smells sweet and refreshing. It&#x27;s not overly perfumed or strong and the scent dissipates shortly after using it. I tried a small spot on my finger to see if it lathered up good and it did. I then tried it with my Clarisonic and fell in love! It left my skin incredibly soft and hydrated afterwards. My skin was hydrated but not oily which is a big thing for me. This is one of the best facial cleaners I have found. I will continue to use this in place of my old one because it is definitely better!&lt;br /&gt;*Complimentary product sent for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love the natural feeling after the cleanser</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean well, will not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great face wash! Smells nice and cleanse deep without over drying!</li>
    <li> Didn t work for my face..made it dry</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because I was in the middle of switching up skin routines or if this just wasn&#x27;t the right type of wash for my skin, but it didnt seem to work for me. I give it 3 stars because of its natural properties and easy application.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked so clean!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I received it yesterday and washed my face with it last night and it felt so fresh and clean afterwards. This is an awesome product and if you are in the market for a new cleanser give this product a try! The consistency is thick enough that it will not run through your fingers and be wasted like other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the results I am getting from the Oz Naturals products.  The face wash was sent to me to try for free, thank you Oz Naturals.  I normally would never switch my face wash.  My skin takes a while to adjust to new face cleansers.  However, I started using this the night I received it,  I wanted to be able to give a review with a little time behind using .  I am happy with the results.  I did have a little bit of an adjustment period from switching but now, almost two weeks down and my skin feels so fresh and clean.  It looks clear and bright.  I am yet to try a product from Oz naturals that hasn&#x27;t impressed me...  I hope you give Oz Naturals a try,  you will not be disappointed.  It&#x27;s amazing stuff and it doesn&#x27;t cost you nearly as much as the makeup in department stores but gives the same or better results..  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try it.</li>
    <li> its ok, nothing special.</li>
    <li> I like that this cleanser is a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; cleanser. It feels nice on the skin and smells pleasant. This product lasted me appoximately 3months. My only upset is that it doesn&#x27;t easily remove makeup. I wear pressed powder and mascara (not waterproof) most days and with this cleanser, I had to wash my face at least 2x to get most of the makeup off. They probably recommend using makeup remover, but I&#x27;m looking for simplicity in my routine and have found drugstore cleansers for $5 that easily remove makeup.</li>
    <li> I definitely feel like it cleanses the face and deep cleans it, much better than having no face-wash and also better than most of the other face-washes I&#x27;ve tried. Not very drying.</li>
    <li> I love this cleaser. No makeup left in your face after using this product. It dosent dries  your face as well.</li>
    <li> Good cleaning.  Leaves skin smooth. Stings when rinsing sometimes.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is a clear gel that makes very little lather.  It has a faint herbal smell similar to witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job cleaning facial skin without leaving it feeling stripped.  It is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate even the sensitive skin around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has a combination of dry, normal, and oily skin and this cleanser works well, so I think that it would be suitable for people with any skin type, except for those who have very dry or oily complexions, as they would benefit from products made specifically for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 oz. (118 ml) tube will last a while, as only a small amount is needed.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (72% Organic):  Organic herbal infusion, organic Aloe barbadensis leaf juice (aloe vera), methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Lavandula officinalis (lavender water), decyl glucoside, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, cocamidopropyl betaine (from coconuts), cocamide MIPA, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, ocean mineral complex, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carrageenan gum, Salvia sclarea (clary sage essential oil), Olea europaea (olive oil), organic Rosa canina (rose hip oil), Borago officinalis (borage oil), Citrus aurantium dulcis (orange peel tincture), Origanum compactum (oregano oil), Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil), Citrus grandis (grapefruit seed ), organic Calendula officinalis (calendula), origanum Arctium lappa (burdock root), organic Trifolium pratense (red clover), organic Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethylhexylglycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals provided cleanser for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I quite enjoyed this cleanser! It left my skin squeaky clean, but not dry. It had a pleasant scent too. I think anyone with combination skin would benefit from it!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and many cleansers that reduce oil leave dry patches behind. This cleanser just leaves me soft, smooth skin. My skin is also sensitive and I experienced no burning or redness from this product, which is a relief. The cleanser itself is clear and odorless. This is a gentle product that seems to even out my combination skin. I would definitely recommend trying this.</li>
    <li> My skin feels clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I have normal skin. This cleanser is not something I can use everyday; too drying for my face and my hands.</li>
    <li> No difference in skin at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about 3 weeks now. It is working very well on preventing breakouts. I also use the company&#x27;s moisturizer and sun screen. I can tell there are no harsh chemicals and a lot of good things from nature in this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I use this on a daily basis at night with my Clarasonic. My skin has never been smoother! It&#x27;s so gentle as well/</li>
    <li> So, first I ordered this for my husband.  He has oily skin, and I have dry skin.  I normally use soaps containing oils for my face, and he normally uses scrubs containing drying agents.  So, I probably shouldn&#x27;t have given it to him to start with.  But, my dryness can be cured by moisturizers, while his break outs are harder to manage, so he&#x27;s always looking for the next great cleanser.  There are *very* few things that he can use that don&#x27;t cause breakouts.  BUT, I should have tried it straight away.  I got a discount for honestly reviewing it, so I need to post the review when I&#x27;ve only used it once (because of the days that have passed while he was trying it).  I will update this if anything different occurs; but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this once, and my skin felt clean and soft.  The fact that it&#x27;s natural and organic means I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being on my skin at all.  I followed it immediately with moisturizer, and have no concern that it will break me out.  It smells a bit odd, as all natural products often do.  So, plan accordingly - but that&#x27;s definitely not a deal-breaker when the alternative is chemically created smells in an unnatural cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;So, this will come with a warning.  If you are REALLY prone to breakouts, this *might* contribute.  I&#x27;m not dinging it, starwise, because it never claims to be noncomedogenic.  It says it unclogs pores of other things, but never says it won&#x27;t clog them itself.  It claims to be gentle on skin, and nourish it.  And, I believe it probably does.  I love that it&#x27;s organic and all natural.</li>
    <li> This smells just like rubbing alcohol. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now. I use it with the Clarisonic and my face feels smooth and clean. It&#x27;s nice but I have yet to see any improvement over the rest of the facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used. Also, no improvement on the size of my pores or with my oily skin. It&#x27;s not bad but I&#x27;m going to keep trying other lotions.</li>
    <li> FIRST...let me tell you about my skin and issues.  I get very warm very quickly.  I can&#x27;t wear coats, scarves, hats because I get too warm.  SO I can&#x27;t have anything on my face that feels heavy because it makes me feel like my face is melting off when I get warm....that said..  THIS IS WONDERFUL.  It is light and lightly scented.  It makes my skin feel soft soft soft.  I tried using it and not putting any moisturizer on to see what it truly does for my skin.  Because you wash off a moisturizer, it is hard to know if it really does anything.  BUT I went a few days with only washing with this and not moisturizing and my skin was soft and supple.  It did not feel dry. AND when I got warm, I did not &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34;.  It washes off clean without any oily or greasy or residue left behind.  TRY THIS...I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE IT.  also..YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE A LOT.  For women on a budget, this is a great thing....a little goes a long way  BUT THAT SAID...I HAVE FOUND THIS ENTIRE LINE TO BE THE SAME WAY...A LITTLE GOES A VERY NICE LONG WAY  I RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> My new favorite face wash. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I gave this a few days use so I can finally write a review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase.  I&#x27;ve been using a lot of facial cleanser products, none of which are organic, mind you and the other products always left my face feeling extremely dry, since I have an oily face.  Until I&#x27;ve stumbled across this gem.  It&#x27;s a pretty light-clear liquid, very faint smell but really potent when it comes to cleansing the face.  It doesn&#x27;t over dry my face afterwards and it leaves a really clean feeling after use.  Best of all, it also leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth to the touch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s and have super dry, irritated skin right now. I normally just use a bar of coconut oil soap to wash my face. But it doesn&#x27;t really get the makeup off and I end up using really harsh toners to get my face clean. I have redness, dryness and some texture problems with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really impressed with this cleanser. I washed my makeup off with it and I am amazed with how clean and soft my skin is. For once my skin has not been further irritated. My skin feels so silky, smooth and softer than it&#x27;s felt in a really long time. It feels as soft as my son&#x27;s skin. I am sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to mention that I tried to use some of my toner afterwards to see how clean my skin was from the cleanser and it was clean! I waste a lot of toner getting excess stuff off my skin and irritate it too much that way. I am glad I found this product &amp; received it in order to share my honest opinion and experiences. I really love it and think it is ideal for normal or dry and irritated skin. I really like the Oz Naturals products and can&#x27;t wait to try some more of them.</li>
    <li> First time I bought this cleanser and I love it,</li>
    <li> I really like OZ natural line of products. They have natural and organic ingredients which are very mild and great for the skin. The products are also cruelty free hence making it a great choice for buyers.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that there is no prominent fragrance in this face wash and it keeps my skin very fresh and smooth all day. I really feel clean and pampered using this face wash. My blackheads have reduced and so have the redness on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my skin feels thanks to Oz natural products. I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> When I first used the cleanser, I thought it did its job. Then, when I used it in combination with OZ Natural Facials Moisturizer,  it caused clogged pores and acnes on my face and neck. I did not have the issue when I just used the cleanser.</li>
    <li> I really like some of their other products, but if you are a woman like me who likes to cut corners, and use your cleanser on/around your eyes, this might not be a good fit. It burns like h*ll if it gets in your eyes. But otherwise, it&#x27;s nice. Definitely not my favorite cleanser though.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is excellent.  My skin was clean, but not taunt.  Very nice product line....would buy again.</li>
    <li> this is amazing highly recommend</li>
    <li> I seem to have a problem with eye irritation after I use this.  My eyes water all day long. I am careful and it still seems to happen. Otherwise, I love what it does to my skin. Very good cleansing. Oh well. I guess this would be fine for someone who is not so sensitive. Back to Aveeno again...</li>
    <li> I am preparing a blog review of this product this evening because the seller sent me a free sample of this face wash for my blog. I wanted to leave a review here because this cleanser has made me change my mind about using a gel cleanser in the winter. I have combination skin. I ALWAYS recommend that people with combo and dry skin switch over to a cream cleanser once colder weather hit because gel cleansers tend to be a bit more drying, you do not need anything that will take more of you natural oils away from you during the late fall and winter. This cleanser right here is very gentle. It does not make my skin feel tight and dry like every other gel cleanser I&#x27;ve used during the wintertime. If you are not the type who wants to switch face washes between season, then this is great product for you.</li>
    <li> They need better packaging so that the product does not leak or explode while traveling. The product works great but the packaging absolutely needs to be changed to a better sealed product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had an issue with facial cleansers and moisturizers drying out my skin. My mom introduced me to the Oz Naturals line and I&#x27;m in love! My skin feels great and I&#x27;ve not experienced and dry, red or irritated skin! This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> This product cleaned.my face well but I felt as though it dried my skin out. I stopped using it and switched back to my normal routine.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product free for review.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Anything from Oz Naturals is a great product in my opinion. Anyway with this facial cleanser it doesn&#x27;t really lather up like most people might think. I use this in the shower and rinse my face with water then apply the product in my palm and rub it a little between my hands and do circular motions all over my face and part of neck area. If you don&#x27;t feel like you have enough on the don&#x27;t be afraid to put more on. This does NOT dry my skin out at all! I even let it stay on my skin for about 15 seconds so my skin can absorb it a little better and then wash it off thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to switch our household into using more and more, green friendly products. We use natural cleaners and some natural skin products as well as other items. It is extremely hard for me to find green skin care products. I can usually use some all natural products, but they do not get the job done. At thirty four I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin, a combination that skin care manufacturers have not seemed to be able to master. I was eager to try out Oz Naturals when I heard how well they work to deep clean and unclog pores as well as use all natural ingredients. All Oz Natural products are cruelty free, organic and contain no alcohol, parabens or sulfates. Oz Natural products are safe for all skin types. Their products are made in the USA and are FDA approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first product that I tried from Oz Naturals was their Ocean Mineral Cleanser. The Oz Natural Ocean Mineral Cleanser deep cleans to unclog pores. It is gentle enough for sensitive skin, yet strong enough to get rid of bacteria. It uses all natural ingredients to clear pores naturally and effectively. I love the smell of this cleanser. You have to be careful as it comes out as an oil form and I find that a lot gets wasted as only a little is needed. It is very mild and did not bother my sensitive skin at all. It also was not drying to my skin. Instead my skin felt very smooth and looked very calm in color. My problem though was that I still needed to use a once a day acne cleanser as it did not get rid of my acne. However, it did improve my all over skin tone and health. Since though it is not what I would call an all-in-one and it has a higher price tag on it, I was a little disappointed it did not do better on the acne as it advertised that it did.</li>
    <li> Hands down one of the best face washes I have ever used works so amazingly, it deep cleans and unclogs my pores. Has 92+ Ocean Minerals. I want to think Tomoson for letting me try this product for free to test and give my honest opinion. Please go see my review @ http://apes-reviews.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Very gentle, but still cleans well.  I love the OZ Natural line of products/.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good for sensitive skin but I don&#x27;t know, I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin at all. Like literally, nothing changed.</li>
    <li> This totally dried my face out after a couple of uses.  A waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I love the OZ Naturals product line...everything I&#x27;ve tried so far has made my skin look wonderful!! This is by far the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used...makes my skin look young and fresh!!</li>
    <li> Smell so so!! Actually dried out my skin a bit.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Arrived super quick too! I have only used this once but I have already seen results. My face is already starting to clear up!</li>
    <li> Love it, you feel it is working since the first time you try it.</li>
    <li> Love this product leaves ur skin so soft</li>
    <li> Skeptical to purchase this product as I&#x27;ve used Aveda for almost 10 years now but I&#x27;ve found myself wanting to try something new.  After reading reviews on multiple sites I thought I&#x27;d give it a go and I have not been disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal to oily skin type, prone to slight breakouts and blackheads.  This cleanser is light and really made for any skin type.  I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has a more even tone to it and my pores seem to be getting smaller.  I now am inclined to purchase the toner and vitamin c serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;ll be disappointed if you try this product!  I did NOT receive this product for free and do NOT regret buying it!  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Im very picky about my cleasners, as my skin is combo/oily.  I love this cleanser! It has a light nice scent and is a clear gel, that foams up into a rich lather. This didnt leave my face tight like most washes. I love, love that all OZ natural products are sealed as well!products!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that this cleanser is life changing - it&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> First of all the smell for this product is terrible. I have always had very clear skin and since I have been using this I&#x27;ve begun to breakout. I bought this face wash along with the OZ Naturals lotion and my skin has gotten dryer since using it. I&#x27;ve had to stop using it completely. Also, it will sting very badly if you accidently get some in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and they were so good I decided to order some of the Oz products. I think most people must have gotten these products for Free in return to leave a positive review! They are ok - nothing great, just ok. I paid for my items so I wanted to leave a real review for anyone looking to purchase. They are ok, not very foaming and I do not feel it removes make up well. I will use up what I have but not purchase again.</li>
    <li> After reading the myriad great reviews I was really excited and hopeful about trying these products (I purchased a serum and eye gel as well), but unfortunately they weren&#x27;t for me. I liked the idea of a really powerful, all natural and almost all organic line, but from the day I started using these products my skin became very dry, I broke out, and developed these random patches of scaly, tiny bumps on my face. I stuck with it for about 2 weeks hoping it was just a transitionary thing, but eventually I couldn&#x27;t stand what was happening to my skin. Switched back to a tried and true line (I&#x27;ve learned my lesson) and my skin is already looking better after 1 night, and on the road to recovery. If the the switch didn&#x27;t make it so drastically clear that the Oz Natural products were doing my skin a disservice, I may have thought, &amp;#34;Hey, maybe these just aren&#x27;t the best products for me.&amp;#34; However, I&#x27;ve tried other products that maybe didn&#x27;t transform my skin and I didn&#x27;t necessarily *love*, but none have actually made my skin worse. Not to say that these products don&#x27;t work for others, but I guess you have to balance out the thousands of success stories with at least one unsuccessful one :/</li>
    <li> I love this mineral cleanser. My face feels so smooth after using it!  It is clear which makes it feel pure and free from harsh chemicals and there is no scent either.  I would definitly buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very nice. I use it in the morning. My face feels really clean and soft, not oily or dry and it&#x27;s very gentle. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a very good cleanser.  It is however, very much like the other Vitamin C Cleanser.  I feel no difference between the two, and I like them both, they are clean and fresh no  scents added, so if you are sensitive to perfumes these cleansers are great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok cleanse, burns the eyes too much</li>
    <li> Oz naturals facial cleanser us awesome. I have been reading up in the product before trying it I love the way it makes my skin feel as well as the smell of the cleanser. I&#x27;m big on skin care and I have my kids already starting early and we do a weekly at home &amp;#34;spa day&amp;#34; where we do our deep cleaning facials using toners cleansers every step now with that we are using for our entire family face care regiment.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
    <li> Something in this makes my eyes burn, like the concept but not sure why it does this if it&#x27;s natural?</li>
    <li> I absolutely love OZ Naturals products! The Ocean Mineral Facial Cleanser with Rose Hip Oil and Vitamin E is gentle on my sensitive skin. Perfect for my combination skin, moisturizes my dry parts and balances my oily parts. 72% organic. Made in the USA and no animal testing!</li>
    <li> This is an OK cleanser.  I wont buy it again though, it made my skin way too dry.  I tried it for a while and increased my moisturizer usage and my skin was still dry.  Went back to my Cerave cleanser and my face is back to normal now!  I didn&#x27;t ask for a refund because I was outside of the refund period. Just didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> I can appreciate that it is natural and is therefore less likely to have all the creepy, fake perfumes in it, it had no smell whatsoever, which was kind of disappointing to me. I also did not notice an immediate improvement in my skin. It is a very expensive product for as little as it has to offer.</li>
    <li> must have in my skin are routine lately!</li>
    <li> i found something equal somwhere else otc cheaper</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser, my skin is sensitive and this product is perfect for it. Even though it is gentle it cleans the skin very well.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! My skin is more even toned and softer!</li>
    <li> Love it, I am still using it daily</li>
    <li> I wish the ingredients were more accurate. They don&#x27;t say on here, but it has lavender and tea tree oil, both of which I absolutely cannot have.</li>
    <li> Too many non-organic ingredients.  The InstaNatural Line has better quality ingredients and for a better price.</li>
    <li> nice product, keep away from eye area, it&#x27;s not tear-proof.</li>
    <li> I have had acne prone skin through my late 30&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t really been able to find anything to help (scrubs, masks, face scrubbers, creams and so many face washes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this was another face wash that didn&#x27;t seem to clean my face or help tame my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next!</li>
    <li> I really like these products, they seem to be very effective and working!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how wonderful this product is ....have been telling everyone I know!!!</li>
    <li> *****I WAS GIVEN A COMPLEMENTARY SAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW**** Excellent, gentle and effective facial cleanser that leaves my skin completely clean of all makeup and outside residue. I love the smell of the cleanser too. Lathers up well and rinses off easily. For a really through clean I strongly recommend OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser!</li>
    <li> Smell bad bad it kinda dry out my face.However after using it, my face felt really clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find a affordable organic face wash. I have combination skin and it has definately made my skin more dry. Probably better to use in the summer than winter, which I did not expect since rose hip is a main ingredient. My biggest issue is that it BURNS my eyes. I am not sensitive to face wash and was disappointed that I now need to use a second cleanser for my eye make up. The few times I decided to bite the bullet my eyes were red for about 30 minutes afterwards. I would not purchase this a second time.</li>
    <li> All Oz Naturals live up to their promise. I have NEVER had a product that did what it said and more. All natural...really!</li>
    <li> I have used Naturopathica products for years. I have super sensitive skin and the Naturopathica aloe cleansing gel is gentle enough to not cause any reactions, but I have to use it twice in a row to actually feel like my skin is clean/make up removed. At $34 a bottle, that just seems ludicrous. I gave this OZ cleanser a shot, tempted by the ingredients, price and the money back guarantee. After a week, I am in love. It cleans my skin beautifully, doesn&#x27;t overdry or need a second application. I haven&#x27;t had any reactions. I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
    <li> This is a nice organic facial cleanser wash. I have been looking for a great one for while. I believe I have found at least one. It has vitamin E and that is a good vitamin for your skin. Rosehip oil is a another nourishing ingredient in this. This is an oil that you will find in a lot of the cleansers to serums lately. Some people are taking straight rosehip oil and putting a drop into their skin care products to add more vitamins to your current products. So as you can see rosehip oil is the big trend. I found with this cleanser it cleaned my face nicely. I do have sensitive skin and had no problems with this working with my skin. I have been using this a couple of weeks and feel good telling you I suggest this. I like to give it a couple of weeks to give my thoughts.  One last note is this is a USA made product. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> My skin has had a heck of a time over my 35 year life.  I finally sorted out what the issue was (major hormonal imbalance...go figure, doctors) and my skin was about 98% clear.  I decided to become a bit more adventurous with my facial products to try to rehydrate and get my skin glowing.  I had been without a big breakout for three months, began this facial cleanser (and their mask) and within two days, my skin looked like garbage again.  It took me about two weeks to clear it up again and did not try the cleanser (or mask) again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the company stood by their guarantee and refunded the money for both products and paid for the return shipping.</li>
    <li> This is my better half’s comments of the Facial Cleanser.  Only a little of the cleanser is needed with water to create a nice foam on the face.  The cleanser helps alleviate oily skin without drying out her face and cleans the face well. The cleanser really doesn’t have any smell and didn’t irritate her skin and doesn’t burn the eyes.  The cleanser leaves her face feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars</li>
    <li> Now like this doesn&#x27;t dry my face out</li>
    <li> I am very happy to be able to try this facial cleasner,first  it barely has a scent,it left my skin very soft  and smooth.It did not irritate my skin, at all.I have used it for a few days,my skin so much different.I love the natural ingredients. I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
    <li> I love everything this product stands for, but it did not work for me. This product made my face worse. I broke out every time I used this product.  Not sure why this didn&#x27;t work for me, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great gentle cleanser. I use it after applying coconut oil to my face to remove my makeup. Doesn&#x27;t over dry, thank god. I get eczema flare ups on my T-zone and this has helped along with their hyaluronic acid serum. I used to get cystic acne breakouts from birth control, but after switching it took a while for my skin to calm down and stop breaking out. This definitely helped nourish my skin after using intense sulfur for my breakouts. I&#x27;m finally getting back to the flawless skin I used to have. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product review is for OZ Natural Facial cleanser that i recieved as a sample product. Oz facial cleanser has natural ingredients such as rosehip oil, vitamin E and ocean minerals, all known to promote healthy, beautiful skin, and to help with aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using store bought brands for a while now, they do just fine but my skin was lacking simething. I needed something more from my facial cleanser. So I thought I would try OZ because I have heard they have quality products.  I am glad that I did, because just after a few days of using it, my face feels softer, my skin looks fresher, and it&#x27;s no longer irritated or dry. And it comes in a convenient tube with a click top lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, I recommend wetting your face with warm water, put a small pea size amount in your hand or on a warm, wet washcloth, then proceed to wash your face. Rubbing gently on your cheeks, for head and all over. I usually do this for about 30 seconds, or until it&#x27;s nice and soapy. Then rinse with warm water, and I like to splash my face with a bit of cold water to finish, it wakes me up. Gently towel dry your face and you are good to go. I like to use it in the morning and at night personally. But once a day at your preferred time works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product, along with their many other products to friends and family. I  will be looking into purchasing more of their products in the very near future. And look forward to seeing what other wonderful products they come out with. I&#x27;m so glad that I got this product for my review.</li>
    <li> Not sure why people say it is a good. Yeah it is mild soap but I don&#x27;t see any benefit after washing my face using the product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for cleaning my face and have spent a lot of money trying different brands. This Facial Cleanser has been the best by far. You really don&#x27;t need much and it does clean your face. I have not had a break out since I started using this product. I noticed some people said that it dries their skin out- maybe don&#x27;t use it every day then? It has worked so well for me, I just ordered some for my teenage son who is starting to experience teen blemishes. You don&#x27;t need to use much either, especially if you apply it to a Clarisonic or some cleansing brush. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> My face has never felt so clean! I couldn&#x27;t believe I splurged on this product, but it is so with it. It does a superior job and is free of all the chemicals and nasties that so many products contain these days. I&#x27;ve since ordered three more Oz Naturals products. I am happy with all of them. All of them are virtually scent-free.</li>
    <li> Only use a little tiny bit of this cleanser, a little goes a long ways. This isn&#x27;t anything like I expected, cleansers usually are all full of alcohol, aggressive, soapy, or gritty. Whoa, this facial cleanser is none of those things, it is a clear liquid that feels like an oil, and kind of acts like oil when you first apply it. Then adding a little water, gentle foam develops. This feels like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried on my face before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face with the cleanser and rinsing off with warm water, my skin was smooth and satiny. The morning when I use this, I have a nice shave, apply a couple drops to my hands, rub all round my face and neck (inspecting for a good shave), and get my hands a little wet and finish washing. I then use a wash cloth to rinse off my face. I&#x27;m amazed at how good my skin looks and feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses this. After removing her makeup and doing her standard face wash, she put a little of this on a wash cloth with some water and washed her face again. She was surprised at how much more dirt came off on the cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gentle cleaning action is great for shaving rash and generally making your face feel a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals has taken a great approach to their packaging. Every one of their products is in a different colored or shaped container. I love that about this company, I don&#x27;t have to study the label carefully. There are three tubes in their face cleaning program - white, blue, and gray. The colors look great together, as my wife said; she would love to have clothes in exactly these colors. It makes it much easier to figure out which tube to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> All of the rave reviews...not from me.  It cleans well, nothing special, not work the cost</li>
    <li> This cleanser makes face feel clean without drying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;A small dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t really done much for me. My pores are still clogged. This product really burns your eyes if you don&#x27;t clean it off your face completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had great skin by any means. I&#x27;ve always struggled with bad skin, larger than normal pores, oily &amp; dis-colored skin, so I&#x27;ve always been on the look out for the best skin products and facial cleansers. I&#x27;ve tried a handful of products from OZ Naturals and have been pretty impressed so I decided to give this a shot. One of the things I love is that all of the products from OZ Naturals are cruelty free and the ingredients are all natural and organic, I was also really drawn to the ingredients which included:  rosehip oil, rich ocean minerals &amp; vitamin e. I was very pleased overall with this product. This facial cleanser was great on my sensitive skin and left me with no irritation. My skin feels much more fresh and vibrant and definitely did a lot for my skin by unclogging my pores and leaving it less oily.</li>
    <li> PCOS mild acne is gone after almost 2 weeks. Chin and jawline pimple free!</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin that reddens easily. This cleanser gently but thoroughly cleaned my face. My face feels great after using it, not tight, not red. If I use a toner afterwords, the cotton ball comes away clean. I can&#x27;t ask for more! I will re-order. BTW a little does go a long way!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin look and feel amazing! Very fresh feeling and eliminates breakouts! I use to have acne since I was 13 and always got dermatologist products but for the first time in my life my skin looks AMAZING!! OZ natural products are magic!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser!!  My face is so much clearer then it ever was! If you have ever had acne issues then use this!  You will love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so picky about face wash. I have acne prone skin which goes back and forth between dry and oily, so it&#x27;s a struggle to find a good wash that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face, but also gets it clean. This did the job quite well, and I was impressed with the price. It&#x27;s not a deep scrub, but a gentle wash, good for daily or every other day face washing to help remove grime and oils, and keep your skin fresh and healthy, and it pairs well with other products in this line. I used the toner right after each day, and saw a nice improvement on the health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given this product to sample and provide honest feedback for potential buyers. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is awesome!! Love the way it makes my skin feel after cleansing. I use other products in the Oz naturals skin care line as well and they all have been great!! I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. My skin is in the best shape since using. No complaints here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample of this product to review, however, the results are my own and my opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;What a great skin care line!</li>
    <li> Finally getting my face back to where it was years ago.  Being more consistent with my daily cleansing and this is the first thing that helped to clear up those ugly whiteheads and tone my pores.</li>
    <li> I LOVE OZ Naturals products and use them daily, but unfortunately this product is an exception.  Here&#x27;s what i did not like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oily residue - I felt it made my acne worse - I don&#x27;t recommend to people who have any acne problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Ouch! My eyes!!!&amp;#34; - This stuff stings like a mofo...the way to tell that all the oily residue is finally removed from my face? The horrible burning stops --no thank you. I have never had this problem with any other face wash.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser.  Before I was using the L&#x27;Oreal cleanser with the scrublet.  The Face Wash by Oz Naturals really cleanses my face, even removing those small bumps/clogged pores I get on my chin.  I would buy this again!  Does not irritate my skin and is not too drying.  Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes, though, it stings!</li>
    <li> So so nice and really deep clean feeling after use. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love this product line. Made a visible difference in tone, evening out my redness in some areas and dryness in others. Monthly breakouts are no longer a problem. It&#x27;s gentle but wonderful. I loved it so much I bought the serum and Super Youth moisturizer which made the most visible difference.</li>
    <li> For those with dry skin and mild acne this would probably be a good daily cleanser. It does make my skin very soft and I don&#x27;t think it made my breakouts worse, I just need something more deep cleaning that contains stronger acne-fighting ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying several Oz Natural products (sent to me for review), including this facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test the thoroughness, I ran a cotton ball with Clinique exfoliating liquid (whatever that purple one is called), and it came out clean. That&#x27;s pretty good, because I use this at the pool, to wash off goopy sunscreen.  I use it with this little gizmo [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I appreciate is that it&#x27;s a tube, not a jar or bottle. This makes it easier to handle at the pool&#x27;s showers. Also, I find tubes are easier to travel by air with and less likely to come open with the increased pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the various OZ products are distinctly colored and packaged. That way, I can tell what I&#x27;m working with, without putting on my glasses. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients seem safe enough. It rinses off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe not the cheapest face wash you can buy, but given the ingredients and that a little bit goes a long way, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> I do not usually review products and will not review them unless I have used them for some time, at least a few weeks. I use a professional and very expensive line from the dermatologist and recently been trying to be a little more in tune to what I put on my skin. I love the OZ Naturals Vitamin C serum and so I decided to test a few more of their products. I am a tough critic and so I would say this cleanser is good. It&#x27;s thick which I like. However I have very sensitive skin which I like to keep thoroughly clean and without using a wash cloth or facial sponge I don&#x27;t think the cleanser thoroughly cleanses the skin. If you use a facial cleansing brush system or a facial sponge I think it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve literally only been using this cleanser for a few days, but I already notice a HUGE difference in my skin! This has never happened with any other cleanser or face wash (even other more expensive!). I have sensitive and acne prone skin (and have actually been breaking out more than normal on my chin/around my lips), but I have been told NOT to buy stuff that directly says &amp;#34;for acne&amp;#34;, etc. So when I came across this cleanser and read reviews, I figured it was worth a shot. I am SO happy I purchased it! My skin feels soft, looks MUCH clearer (it dried out almost all of my existing acne), and my pores look smaller. I am in love. This ONLY thing even semi-negative I would say it that it dries my skin out just a little. BUT, I use a good moisturizer as part of my routine anyways, so it&#x27;s not really a big deal.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!  I found that a little bit of this cleanser does a great job.  It thoroughly cleanses my face and leaves it soft and supple - no feeling of tightness.  My only recommendation is to be careful not to get it in your eyes as it does sting.</li>
    <li> So in love with this product line im 30yrs old and suffer from acne nothing I have been trying has even touched it until now</li>
    <li> makes my face feel clean but i haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin since using it.</li>
    <li> I quite like this cleanser.  It gently but thoroughly cleans my skin without excessive drying and seems to promote circulation.  I noticed a slight tingle after my skin dried but no discomfort or irritation.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser.  I love that it is frangrance free and you only have to use a small amount each time...which means will last longer.  I love how it goes on and cleans.  My face feels wonderful.  I received it two days ago and I can already see a noticeable change to my skin texture and overall the way it makes my skin feel and look.  I will never use another cleanser on my face again.</li>
    <li> Can use just a  tiny amount with Clarisonic Mia.  Feels very clean with out drying.</li>
    <li> I always seem to have issues with cleansers burning my skin due to my dry and sensitive skin issues. OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser has become my best friend. It has helped to reduce my blackheads and helped to reduce my dry skin issues. I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with burning or stinging, just clean, healthy skin. There is absolutely no scent, at least not one that I could pick up, which has also made it my husbands favorite. (He stole it when he ran out of his and has been thieving it on a daily basis! We&#x27;ll have to get him his own). I am thankful to have found something that works for me and my issues without being ridiculously expensive. And my husband is thankful too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product free for review. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser as it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and I am 42. I really don&#x27;t like the smell of it but that is more a personal thing.</li>
    <li> I have been getting terrible blackheads all over my nose, chin, and my forehead!  They are so embarrassing, and every time I am ready to leave the house, I put on as much concealer and foundation as possible to try and hide them.  It has been a couple weeks of using the Oz Naturals Facial Cleanser, and I am starting to notice 50% reduction with the blackheads on my face!  I am also noticing that I have brighter and smoother skin.  My foundation glides on so easily, and I am using less of it now because I don&#x27;t need to hide as many blackheads as I used to.  I will continue using this product because it has been the most effective out there with reducing the blackheads on my face!</li>
    <li> This is a smooth, gentle cleanser.  It works well to remove makeup and it gives the face a nice clean feel after.  My face feels smooth and ready to apply face serums before bed.  Just be very careful to not let the water drip into your eyes as you are applying water to your face after applying the cleanser.  I have gotten the water on the corner of my eye unintentionally and it does sting.  That is the only reason I did not give this product a 5 star.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s organic and gentle yet deep cleans with rosehip oil, ocean minerals and vitamin E. Works very well with my skin type (oily/dry) and does not irritate my rosacea. I use it morning and night followed by Oz tonic, moisturizer and serums and could not ask for a better beauty regimen. My skin looks hydrated and smooth and feels great. I love that it&#x27;s alcohol-free and made here in America. I&#x27;m completely sold on Oz products and have yet to find anything better.</li>
    <li> This face wash is totally awesome especially if you have acne prone skin I wash my face with this and half of my acne was gone within a week .</li>
    <li> This pure, natural cleanser works gently and rinses off easily without drying-out your skin!  Previously, I was using soap-based products to cleanse which were too harsh and stripped my skin of natural oils.  I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family seeking high-quality, cruelty-free skincare.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser not only because its an effective wash its also very natural . it really get the face very clean and you only need to use a small amount to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wash as so many great for your skin ingredients the list is long which makes it a fantastic value because you are getting a really nice sized tube that will last and last. I really like using it ,it foams up nicely get rid of makeup and excess oils but leaves the skin very smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;This facial cleaner is filled with rosehip oil and vitamin E and other minerals and herbals to really make it a great facial wash that is very easy to use . This is also a great size being 4 fl oz and a very small amount is all you need for clean and nourished skin .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! I have oily skin and it is tough to find a cleanser that makes my skin feel clean but not dry. This product works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried. My skin feels taut and oil free for most of the day.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight and itchy.  The size is giant and lasts more than 6 months, using it once a day before bed.  Just made my second purchase.  Follow it up with OZ Naturals Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in this awesome cleanser, are  all natural. My skin feels amazing, and I love it!  There really isn&#x27;t a fragrance. It is just a nice, clean, gentle lather which does not have a ton of lather because this doesn&#x27;t use industrial detergents like so many of our cleansers. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The reason I say this product is OK is because I was not unhappy with the Cetaphil cleanser I used before.  OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser lathers beautifully and cleanses even my eye makeup.  The only negative is that it irritates my eyes at times.  The results are excellent, but the slight irritation of my eyes bothers me.  I don&#x27;t know if I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> Ocean Mineral Facial Cleanser with Rose Hip Oil and Vitamin E is another skin care product from the wizards at Oz Naturals. Like their other products that I’ve tried (after receiving complimentary samples for review), it’s excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rose Hip Oil is probably the source of the lovely subtle scent that you’ll detect immediately after snapping off the cap. The Vitamin E is probably the source of the benefits that you’ll feel after washing your skin. I don’t want to sound like a TV commercial, but my skin does seem to glow after washing it clean with this product. It’s recommended that you follow it with Oz Natural’s other serums, and I won’t quarrel with that, but it seems to have the desired effect all on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian W. Fairbanks</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great!</li>
    <li> Just reordered for the third time.</li>
    <li> Bought this hoping to do wonders for my skin. Well, I was wrong. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not great either. Definitely not worth the $30 I paid for this! I have a lot of pores and blackheads and it didn&#x27;t get rid of them at all. I think they actually got worse... I have dry/oily skin and this dried out my skin even with my moisturizer!!! Scent is not pleasing either. DO NOT listen to all of these reviews because most of them are sponsered!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this cleanser and my skin is really liking it.  I also like that it is organic.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Works well, but the scent is too strong for me even though it&#x27;s all naatural.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin clean and refreshed. Great cleanser and you get a large bottle for the price. Will buy more OZ Naturals products. Will recommend to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is gentle and works better than witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mother that is in her sixties, and asked her to only substitute this for her witch hazel that she uses daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of a week, she noticed an overall appearance to her beautiful skin. I even used it on my manly skin, it left me with a refreshed feeling. Also, it did not dry my face out like soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides just cleaning the skin, there are special ingredients like aloe, lavender, and tea tree that will help to protect your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the gentle nature of the cleanser, it is safe for skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> Not seeing a significant difference in skin; but it smells decent.  Noticed that it dries my skin out compared to other products although skin feels softer afterwards.</li>
    <li> it feels like a natural mud mask, and u just wash it off</li>
    <li> I love the cleanser.  It removes all the makup and grime off my face.  When I run a cordon ball with toner on it in the morning the cotton ball is clean..my skin looks really great after I wash it.  They are very generous with the container size.  I would love to see this in a pump bottle instead of a tube.  The tube does not have a way to stand up after you put the cleanser in your hand or towel.  Wonderful product.  I will be purchasing this product again.  Thank you for letting me test this product.  You can really see the difference.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It removes makeup better than conventional soaps. Leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my face feel! Gets all my makeup off and my face feels tight and clean. Love it!</li>
    <li> First of all, I was lucky enough to get to try these new products for free. Saying that, I have been using this cleanser for a couple of weeks. It has a nice light foaming action, feels really good on the skin. Gets all the makeup off although I would be careful around the eyes can burn a little. Has a nice ingredient list with No Parabens! Big plus for that one, over all I really like the cleanser and will buy in the future. This will last for some time as you only need a little bit.</li>
    <li> Like this will buy more when it is gone.</li>
    <li> I went organic cos I thought it would be better for my face. I&#x27;m pretty sure it is, however this particular organic face wash is making me break out. As cheap as I am, spending $20+ on something that is making it worse is not making me happy at all. I thought my face had to get used to it so maybe a few days for that. But it&#x27;s been two weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t gotten better</li>
    <li> Good cleanser, no adverse effects,will purchase again. Still not been using it long for a truly honest opinion, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I am in the sixth month of use for this facial cleanser and have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with the results. I have a multitude of allergies and sensitivities and have had a lot of difficulty finding a facial care regimen that didn&#x27;t cause me problems.  Before trying the OZ Naturals products, I was using a natural olive oil line for my dry skin.  I had frequent breakouts and a couple of dry, rough patches that wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what I tried.  My skin was always blotchy looking, so I constantly used foundation to help cover the uneven skin tones.  I started using this facial cleanser about six months ago. Those rough dry patches I&#x27;d had for several months completely disappeared within the first week of use and in less than two weeks, my skin tone had improved and my breakouts were gone. Now I rarely have any breakouts, and when I do, it is almost always a single pimple that is soon gone.  I like the fact that this cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean, but not stripped dry.  This product is a good value as well.  After six months of use, I am finally getting low enough on the product to need to reorder, and I definitely plan to keep using this.</li>
    <li> I could go on and on about the ingredients and what they can do for you, but I&#x27;ll let you read the item description. Instead, I&#x27;m gonna tell you what I think of the product itself. It&#x27;s super gentle for one thing. A very airy, light gel that cleans your skin with no harshness and no adverse reaction from my sensitive, rosacea prone skin. It still maintains a rich feel on your skin, however. It only takes the tiniest amount, so this generously sized tube is going to last forever. Afterwards my skin feels clean without feeling dry or tight and I can tell simply by the weightless feel of my skin that it&#x27;s ready to suck up the best my following serums and such have to offer. As a blogger, I review a lot of products that I often throw aside for the next bright shiny toy. Not the case here, this is going to sit by my sink till every last drop is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this to review, however all opinions are my own..</li>
    <li> This is a gentle, and thorough cleanser that doesn&#x27;t strip my skin or make it too dry and has a light, refreshing scent.  I purchased this in combination with the Retinol Serum and Moisturizer to use at night, and they all work very well together. I have noticed that I need to rinse my eyes a little more than with my normal cleanser or they sting a bit. I would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> My skin ranges from feeling dry and parched at certain times of the month to suddenly being overly oily and prone to breakouts, and what I love about this line is that this face wash, and the moisturizer which goes with it, are able to take care of the oily parts of my face without stripping the natural oils from the rest of my skin. This is the perfect facial cleanser and moisturizer combination for those with an oily T-zone and dry skin on your cheeks or neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that my skin was very well cleansed and looked fresh and dewy after use. I would really recommend the moisturizer that goes along with this cleanser, because they work very well in concert with one another. While I received a sample of this product for review purposes, I intend to continue purchasing because they have a better price point than the brands I had previously been using (Lush and L&#x27;Occitane).</li>
    <li> This all-natural cleanser is awesome. For a long time, I was looking for the perfect cleanser that didn&#x27;t contain any harsh ingredients and really was an all-natural product. My skin is dry, sensitive, and acne prone so finding the right cleanser had always been important. This cleanser has to be one of the best ones, I have used. Many cleansers had left my skin feeling dry, itchy, and had even broke me out. This never did. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell, so that takes some getting used too. But I have never broken out and my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry anymore, like it usually does after I wash it. I am really excited to try OZ naturals other products, because so far I have experienced no problems with this product!</li>
    <li> only 3 weeks using this wonderful- really wonderful facial soap my skin looks amazing.. I tried many several expensives products but neither of them works as OZ Naturals products do.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again OZ.</li>
    <li> Great light weight cleanser. Does a thorough job of cleaning. I use it with a cleansing brush when I have had makeup on for even deeper cleaning. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still deciding if I&#x27;m loving this product.</li>
    <li> This is good natural cleanser, however leaves a slippery film after rinse. I&#x27;ve been using it alternatively with Dr Bronners soap - using the liquid soap daily and use this product occasionally when my skin needs a more thorough cleanse. Skin condition has been improved a lot and it is much softer and the pores are cleaned better now. I truly believe this product at least does not harm your skin in any way</li>
    <li> I have troubled skin. This cleanser seems to deeply clean without irritating or leaving my face parched, which is a big deal when you are no longer making oil like a teenager. Simple and works well. Very rare breakouts when using this daily.</li>
    <li> We really like the OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser, it is mild and works well without any negative after-affects. What&#x27;s important to me in a cleanser is that it is made with natural ingredients that work together to clean and refresh my skin without putting chemicals into my body. OZ Naturals always delivers products that I can trust.&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for me to review.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a facial cleanser that would make my combination skin feel clean but not stripped dry.  I have tried a lot of different facial cleansers from drugstore to luxury brands.  I like the feel of this cleanser as well as the clean feeling I get by using it.  My face feels like the daily grime has been washed off but not dried out.  The other appealing attributes are the organic, vegan, cruelty free aspects of this cleanser.  There is no harsh or offensive scent. I&#x27;m not sure it has a fragrance at all.  If it does, it is very mild.  I will continue to use this cleanser as I have been having great results with it.  Just a note - this cleanser would work great with a Clarisonic if you use one.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it had great reviews and I wanted a new facial cleanser to clear out my skin. I have combination skin and really just wanted a cleanser for my t-zone acne. I don&#x27;t break out often but I wanted something that would prevent that from happening. This cleanser actually made me break out even worse, especially on my forehead. The cleanser itself is too rough and after washing my face with it, my face would feel tight and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use it for myself. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a hit for others but I regret spending so much for such a low quality cleanser.</li>
    <li> My 2nd favorite under the OZ Naturals Vitamin C version.</li>
    <li> If you struggle with acne, use in combo with tea tree oil. This soap is soothing and like rubbing aloe on face. Cleanses well but not astringent enough alone.</li>
    <li> good product &amp; is as described, but my skin didn&#x27;t react well to this. It didn&#x27;t feel clean. I used the Sea Infused moisturizer and it always felt dry</li>
    <li> I love OZ skin care products because it comes from nature and it is organic. It does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates That are bad for you skin in the long run. It is made  in the USA and the quality is really amazing. This product is very comparable to those high end department store skin care products. To me, it works better than my Lancome cleasner. It does not make my skin dry at all and it gives a nice glow after only a few uses. It is gentle enough to use on daily basis as a daily facial cleasner. The rich ocean minerals &amp; vitamin e works great on deep pore cleasing. Sometimes, the makeup remover cannot take all makeup away from the face. This will help to remove and wash away any left makeup and impurities. This face wash works on sensitive skin like mine and it didn&#x27;t break me out. Five stars and will continue using it. 4 fl oz can last me about 3-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy reviewing this product in exchange of a discount. My opinions are honest and based on my own experience after testing this product out for a period of time.</li>
    <li> This is a gel cleanser that is very gentle and non-drying.  My face feels amazing.  I like that I recognize all of the ingredients in it, if not technical names, then the descriptive names.  If I don’t know how to pronounce it, at least I know what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, my face feels cleaner than using Clinique soaps or any of the liquid or gel soaps in my house.  The OZ facial cleanser rinsed off cleanly.  It left my skin feeling soft and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only curiosity was in the naming of this product – Ocean Minerals.  The Ocean has always dried my skin.  I saw aloe and lavender in the Herbal infusion ingredients but the ocean infusion ingredients – cellulose, clary sage, olive oil, rose hip oil…  I did not understand this at all.  But I can’t argue with results so I am good with the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this facial cleanser.  I have chemical sensitivities and am allergic to some fragrances, so I appreciate that this cleanser is 72% organic ingredients.  It feels very natural and does not have any strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep it in the shower to wash my face and neck.  I try to follow it with serums (at times) and moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin seems a bit tighter and smoother after using these products.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes.  I plan to continue to use these products and hope to keep my skin smoother and prevent some signs of aging in the future.</li>
    <li> This cleanser cleans my skin naturally! Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been doing great since i use this OZNatural Facial Cleanser, it makes my skin moisturize and feels so soft and smooth,having a dry skin before but since i used this OZNatural Facial Cleanser all of the sudden it change a lot,made my skin healthy and glowing skin ,really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I received this OZ Natural Facial Cleanser for free in exchange of my review.</li>
    <li> This review is based on 11 weeks usage.&lt;br /&gt;This a thin concentrated gel and you won&#x27;t need a lot of it to cover your face. Please be aware that a lot of it does come out when you press the tube, so you might want to pop the top back on fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It washes off really well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. It has a nice fresh fragrance, which is particularly important to me, because as I grow older I find it really difficult to cope with flowery or perfume smells.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels fresher, cleaner and softer after use. It works well in combination with other OZ Natural products as part of my skincare regime.&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals is becoming well-known for their high quality products and delivering skincare that does what it says on the package. As with most, if not all of the products I have been sent to review by OZ Naturals, I would buy them. That in itself is the best recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product via Amazon courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.</li>
    <li> This is hands down one of the best facial cleansers ive ever used. I looooove how clean it makes my skin feel and I actually really love the smell. it feels so good knowing how many amazing ingredients are in this cleanser and that theyre all feeding my skin with wonderful nutrients. This cleanser is also amazing if you have acne or oily skin, it doesn&#x27;t over dry unless you leave it on (which its a cleanser so there&#x27;s no need to), it does exactly what a day after swimming in the ocean does which I personally love because it clears my skin with all the yummy minerals and enzymes from the ocean. LOVE! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Really happy with this cleanser.  My face does well with it, and I have dry skin.  I have noticed my skin looks &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; and more even when I use it.  It has lasted me a long time, because a little goes a long way.  Worth the cost, but honestly not that expensive when compared to other stuff.  This is the second product I have used from OZ, which I had never heard of until recently.  Call me impressed.</li>
    <li> Fresh, Fresh, Fresh!!  That is how you will feel after using this product.  Once again, I am very pleased using this from O.Z.  Very little is needed and I deep cleans the face, making it ready for serums to do their work.  Yes, I would recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This product really diminishes the pores on my face .  It is very gentle on the skin and really cleanses your skin.  Another great product from OZ Naturals!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Love that it&#x27;s all natural.  Gentle and effective.  Great for my acne prone skin. Does not necessarily have a pleasant scent however</li>
    <li> I honestly love this face wash! Unscented, just smells clean and pure - and it is not overly foamy - which was an adjustment for me when I first started using it because my other cleanser was very foamy -- so the first time I used this I used way too much (you really do not need a whole lot) - it felt creamy and nourishing, but I just did not think I has enough to really remove my makeup, boy was I wrong - this stuff is powerful and leaves your skin very clean! Once you start rinsing it off you can already tell that your skin already feels softer too.</li>
    <li> Ok cleanser.  Left my face feeling clean, but not worth the money and the sponsored hype from fake reviews.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product that there was nothing that I do not like about it.  FABULOUS!  I have three tubes so I do not run out😘</li>
    <li> Sorry to only put 2 stars, but I had to rate it so that my review can be posted.  Just a few moments ago, I tried using the promotion codes and received an error message of invalid code.  Based upon the raving reviews, I decided to take my chances and bite the bullet and purchased the facial cleanser and moisturizer.  Of course, it would have been nice to receive the discounts, BUT IF the products work wonders on my face, I will be absolutely happy happy!!!  I will definitely update my rating as soon as I check out the products.....</li>
    <li> Love it!! This is my new go to face product.  I even use it with my Mia face ionizer.  My pours are really opened up by this stuff and I feel like my face can breathe again!!  I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 2 weeks since I began using this product to cleanse my skin, and while there hasn&#x27;t been DRASTIC changes -- there hasn&#x27;t been any breakouts either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is severely acne prone and it takes a lot of effort and responsibility in keeping it refreshed, clean and ph balanced. This product does just that and created for sensitive skin (not harsh, very gentle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally when I test out a facial product, I&#x27;ll know right away (within 36 hrs) if that product will be suitable for my skin. Don&#x27;t get the wash in your eyes as it REALLY BURNS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company also shipped really fast -- received it 2 days earlier than expected delivery date (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for women who have problematic skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff has great ingredients. Rose hip (Vitamin C), Vitamin E, and the 92 minerals from the ocean are great on the face. This makes the skin feel really great and clean and refreshed. . It does not contain the usual toxins that are bad for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy many of the Oz skin products, but especially this one....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, author of the two-time award winning book, The Live Food Factor, as well as others, such as Beyond Broccoli</li>
    <li> Personally this product wasn&#x27;t for me. I felt as if it was not strong enough for my face. I&#x27;m a guy so maybe I need something more tailored to men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the natural ingredients and love how there is very little to no scent.</li>
    <li> Product was okay. Not as good as I expected from the other reviews. Hard to find really good face products that do what they say they do. Maybe some day.</li>
    <li> I use to use Merlen Norman. Now I am changingfor natural products. I like this product. My face is more clear and I look a little younger.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I switch from using this cleanser and their Vitamin C cleanser, both are amazing!  Great for all types of skin!</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews, I had high hopes this would help my skin. I broke out so badly from using the ocean minerals cleanser, the tonic &amp; retinol serum-  it&#x27;s embarrassing.  I hesitate to give a bad review because I love what this company stands for...just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Very gentle. Great for skin prone to acne.</li>
    <li> I chose this cleanser for my pores. Light lather gentle to your face. My face doesn&#x27;t have that dry feel anything. Try it your face will be happy!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser, it&#x27;s perfect for my combination aging skin. I ran out of my cleanser and I received this new product for free from OZ just in time.  I love how this feels on my skin and doesn&#x27;t strip away all my natural oil. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I usually use Origins Checks and Balances foaming face wash and recently decided to try OZ Naturals line of face care.  Started using OZ Naturals facial Cleanser about 10 days ago.  I love the squeaky  clean feeling you get after using it without my skin feeling dry and tight. It&#x27;s even gentle around eyes without any irritation. I use make up wipes so unsure how well it removes heavy makeup.  A small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable cleanser. Excellent choice for sensitive skin since it has no fragrance nor irritating ingredients. It cleanses my skin beautifully leaving it dewy clean, free of makeup, and feeling soft and supple. You need just a little of this to cleanse your entire face. For me, it&#x27;s wonderful facial cleanser! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really liked this facial cleanser. I have very sensitive skin and usually whenever trying new products I instantly break out. Bad. Have been using this product for a few weeks now.  This gentle cleanser left my face feeing very smooth and clean without any crazy  breakouts or redness. Not big on the scent and does not remove make up. Not a big deal since I use make up wipes first.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser. It&#x27;s very light and low sudsing compared to the usual cleanser I buy (Origins).  After I use it my face feels super clean, and stays feeling that way all day.  I like this, will order again for sure.</li>
    <li> great product, skin feels cleans and refreshed with drying. It is completely transparent, no colors and no scent.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this cleanser...it leaves my skin very smooth &amp; soft and I know as time goes by the rose hip oil and vitamin E will continue to improve my skin. I love the solid packaging &amp; fragrance free formula.</li>
    <li> like other Oz Naturals products I&#x27;ve gotten, very good</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. I will definitely try other oz products.</li>
    <li> This cleanser works really well. It leaves my face feeling soft and clean. Thanks for another great product!</li>
    <li> I have received this product free of charge for my review purposes, all opinions and thought are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love trying new beauty products! I have tried a few of the OZ Naturals products, and have rally enjoyed using all of their products.&lt;br /&gt;I have really enjoyed using this. It is an organic face wash that is considered to be the highest quality skin cleanser on the market. It includes powerful ingredients including rosehip oil, rich ocean minerals and vitamin E. I highly recommend this product it will leave your skin glowing. It goes on and clean well leaving your pores much smaller in size. I have used a few different cleansers and I truly love this one! It has no perfume smell, actually no smell at all. fragrance free. It is a very gentle cleanser with lots of natural ingredients. It is excellent for acne and breakouts as well. My daughter loves this cleanser as much as I do. I highly recommend this cleanser. It left our skin feeling very smooth ans soft! Give it a try you will not be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other things I really like about the OZ Naturals line of skin care products is that the are cruelty free organic products. Their products are also made in the USA.</li>
