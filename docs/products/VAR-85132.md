<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it. ! Use them dry or eet, with or without primer. Blend well, last all day long.</li>
    <li> No queda lasonbra bien secae encuanto melapongo</li>
    <li> I wear this makeup everyday. It stays on all day. Everyone always compliments my eyes. I personally recommend this product. I&#x27;ve had it a little under a year now and I&#x27;ve only ran out of three colors. It&#x27;s honestly the best😍</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup freak and these colors are awesome love them I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more. I usually spend a lot on my makeup but this was very reasonable and look just as good!</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous, nude, shimmery colours. Perfect for wedding makeup - you can use wet for a dramatic effect, or keep it sheer by not using water. The California palette is also excellent for both day and night, depending on your application method. Colours last a long time when used with primer of course, one of my longest lasting palettes in fact. But as reviewer Ohelloagain mentioned, you must use these wet if you want to get the intense colours. That&#x27;s the whole point of baked eyeshadows - to have the option of wearing them sheer or intense - and they last aaaaall day. Most baked shadow palettes are uber expensive, so this is a great deal and I expect it will last me a long time. As a woman of colour, I can say this palette will work great for all skin tones! You could even use the darker shadows as a type of liquid eyeliner while wet.</li>
    <li> feels like I need to put on a lot just for it to be visible.. and I use a primer before hand...</li>
    <li> I liked the colors of these shadows but they have too much glitter to them. It does not apply easy and comes off fast. I kept the product and will use it but would not buy another set.</li>
    <li> The shadows were all broken on arrival. because of them being broken all of the colors are muddled together. Will clean out the mess and use the mirror which is the only thing that may be worth the money.</li>
    <li> all the colors look alike - all the brown / bronzy colors look the same, and all the champagne / vanilla  look the same ( i am not calling them by there real name&#x27;s because it is a waste of time .... this is not a &amp;#34;steal&amp;#34; or a bargain because the purple looks just like the browns.....</li>
    <li> Very inferior quality, hard to use.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really see the colors on your skin. The all pretty much look the same</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order this and I got it the same day, it&#x27;s not as pigmented as I thought but it&#x27;s still absolutely amazing and it gives me that shimmer look that I love.</li>
    <li> I got this because everything I&#x27;d ever gotten from e.l.f had impressed me! This pallet looked beautiful in the picture. When I got it, I was a little disappointed because the colors seemed to be pretty different, but whatever they were still pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Once I tried using this, I realized it wasn&#x27;t very pigmented at all. . .it is near impossible to use dry. When using it wet, the colors are VERY vibrant, but I don&#x27;t always have the time or occasion to do such bold eye looks :/&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I am pretty disappointed with this pallet. The more glittery colors are just that. Glitter, and the more matte brown doesn&#x27;t go on well at all, I end up having to really try to get any pigment on my lid. If you&#x27;re looking for a pallet to use wet though, I&#x27;d recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love the colors, they don&#x27;t disappoint. I tried them wet and loved them. Now I just need the other pallet of colors.</li>
    <li> I love the colors! They are a great gift! Amazing quality!</li>
    <li> I hate this product very dusty and when i open it was broken so upset 😟</li>
    <li> E.L.F Baked Eyeshadow Palette offers some nice shades. They are somewhat shimmery but not very pigmented. I guess that&#x27;s good if you prefer more demure eyeshadows. They do blend well and are easy to apply. They would be good for any occasion being that they&#x27;re not too loud...even the shimmer is subtle. They, however, don&#x27;t seem to have enough &amp;#34;staying&amp;#34; power. You probably would have to reapply because the shimmer seems to wear off quite readily. I have to admit that I&#x27;ve never used them wet...so they might have more staying power that way. In any case it&#x27;s a decent eyeshadow palette.</li>
    <li> Nice colors... Didn&#x27;t show up very well. If you wet them they will show up a little bit better.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! Elf makes amazing products for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I rated this makeup the way I did is because it&#x27;s glitter gets all in my eyes and from the picture you really can&#x27;t tell that there is glitter in it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors,  fast shipping, love it!</li>
    <li> The colours are very faint, barely pigmenting the skin (with or without a base eye primer). Will try again perhaps with a gel to &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> By comparison to Sephora&#x27;s baked eyeshadow palettes that contain similar shades this is rather impressive. These make great beauty themed gifts for friends, or loved ones. Using a dense eyeshadow brush these guys go on smooth, stay on successfully, &amp; are pigmented enough that you don&#x27;t need a lot to build a solid color but are still easy to diffuse. I would recommend trying these before investing $35 for Sephora&#x27;s line.</li>
    <li> apply wet or colors don&#x27;t show up just the shimmer but very nice</li>
    <li> VERY glittery ... not simply a shimmer.  Colors appear very nice in the case but the intensity doesn&#x27;t transfer to the skin - yet the glitter does.  I keep experimenting but so far, I&#x27;m not too impressed.  I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t spend a ton of money on this ...</li>
    <li> Like the color assortment &amp; it&#x27;s high pigment. Just needs to come down in price a tad!</li>
    <li> Love elf but these suck... way to shimmery and the pigment is poor.</li>
    <li> Great color choices but not as pigmented as I would have hoped.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow takes multiple layers to get the color to show up. Great price, but not great quality.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!</li>
    <li> Thought it would be more pigmented, but it resulted to be an eye shadow palet for little girls :S, however since the colors turn to light on the eye, it could be used for natural looks.</li>
    <li> Bought for granddaughter for Christmas.  Looks great...love the colors....we will see....</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors for party</li>
    <li> These are very decent eyeshadows for the price. They are very shimmery and look best when applied wet.</li>
    <li> Pigment is exactly as pictured. Shows up bright, and wears well.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to some more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> very nice palette. I wear it every day</li>
    <li> the colors are beautiful but almost impossible to bet them to transfer onto the eyeshadow brush. This is now my travel makeup...</li>
    <li> Got my package in 2 days (as promised) and was so happy, this eyeshadow is very beautiful and has good pigment,  also very good packaging! This is my first time buying elf and I will definitely be trying more of there products</li>
    <li> I found this product to be good. It was just what i wanted,bright and dark colors with shimmer. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the colors!! The only problem with this is it&#x27;s very hard for it to stick to the application brush...both using it dry or with water. Once it is applied...it stays on for a very long time and is very pretty!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and last all day!</li>
    <li> Basically plastic. In store it&#x27;s fine but I can&#x27;t even get my brush to pick up anything.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors! However, the lightest color was already broken, with powder everywhere. I wish it had been a different color, as I use the lightest colors everyday and always use a darker one in the corner. They are beautiful though. I always prefer baked eye shadow because of the nice pigmentation and shine!</li>
    <li> This pallette is so pretty - perfect for my blue eyes. The product came EXACTLY when it was estimated to, and I was so happy to open it and find that none of the shadows were broken up or even cracked. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Should have returned it based on the condition it arrived in.  Waste of time putting it on only for it to fade in an hour.</li>
    <li> Requires a lot of work to actually wear it. The colors would be beautiful if they were easier to transfer from the pallet to my eyes. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Really for real all of you who say the makeup won&#x27;t go on use water. If you have to use more than you think do so you will be more than pleasantly surprised. The colors shown are pretty close except they are way more glittery! Way worth the dough.</li>
    <li> So beutifull and the case is so nice i love it.</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous but 2 of then showed up crushed.. 1 of them the main reason I wanted this palate</li>
    <li> Great palette. The texture is fun.</li>
    <li> You have to apply generous amount of the color for it to actually show on your eye lid. Next time, I will jut splurge and buy an Urban Decay Naked palette.</li>
    <li> Took about two weeks. Came in complete broken and in a unusable condition! So I pretty much paid 10$ for an empty eyeshadow case! Not happy, would not order again!</li>
    <li> Nice and great for everyday.  My 15 year old niece wars it on the daily and it doesn&#x27;t look to heavy or old.</li>
    <li> I do like the variety of colors in the palate and the price is hard to beat.  With the advice of other users, I wet the brush a bit which really did help with the application.  A few colors are bit too golden for me, but overall it was a good purchase.  Just know that the size is BIG, so its not something you can really carry around in purse.</li>
    <li> This set is great.  You can achieve both &amp;#34;high glamour&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34;, depending upon whether you use them wet or dry, and how much you apply.  I am really impressed!</li>
    <li> Love this pallet! Shimmering colors that range from very subtle to rich and deep. I use for work and casual wear.</li>
    <li> I saw this at Target and hesitated because I had never tried E.L.F. cosmetics before. Am I ever glad I took a chance. This is a gorgeous eye shadow palette that would work on many different ranges of complexions and skin colors. Univerally flattering. I used to spend $50 on Urban Decay Naked palettes. No more! Thank you E.L.F.!  For some reason my local Targets are not carrying these any more so when I run out, I will definitely come to Amazon to get more. My only request would be for them to do a palette in a rose gold theme, kind of like Naked 3 by Urban Decay.</li>
    <li> This was suggested on pinterest as a dupe to one the another brands that you would pay 45 dollars for. I have to say I cant tell the difference.</li>
    <li> Looks like pic. Breaks easily. Cram colour arrived broken but I didn&#x27;t see need to return as it looked broken in packaging and can still be used. Not as pigmented as they look</li>
    <li> Love! Similar to Urban Decay Naked!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright.  I have to apply it with my fingertips because it&#x27;s kind of difficult to load on to a brush without making a huge mess.</li>
    <li> The colors don&#x27;t show up very well on my skin, and they are very glittery. Not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought the brushes for my daughter and she was thrilled. She couldn&#x27;t get over how soft they were. I loved the eyeshadows! The colours were excellent and they were easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about my first Amazon purchase...so I was very sad when it was delivered and one of the shadows had completely broken and the broken pieces of the shadow were all over the other lower level shades.  However, I really loved the colors and use the upper level shades everyday...so this would have definately been a love it, except for it arriving broken and messy.</li>
    <li> These eye shadows are as lovely as the ones that cost a fortune. They stay on all day. They also blend with perfection. Great buy.</li>
    <li> So this was my mistake not knowing anything about Baked eyeshadow. This has to be used wet! So you have to wet your brushes then dip into the shadow. Once I figured that out, everything worked out perfectly. :-)</li>
    <li> I love this palette! The colors are awesome and they are all so easy to blend. I love the texture of them and it goes onto the eye lids very nicely. Overall, I am very satisfied with these eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> Love the colors last long :)</li>
    <li> A little powdery. Seems I might go through this quickly, when I use my makeup brush the eyeshadow seems to go down quickly. However, the colors are awesome and do the job! It is a great value.</li>
    <li> Good pallet, I wish the pigments were darker</li>
    <li> Nice. Good colors but does not apply/cover as easily as other brand shadows I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Very shimmery. If you have a heavy upper lid you may want to avoid and stick with matte shadows.</li>
    <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
    <li> Love these colors and my daughter liked them too.........</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner, packaging was great. Love the colors! Very Impressed!</li>
    <li> I love the variety of colors in this pallet, the lighter colors are very subtle, but can be used as for highlighting. I have traveled with this case, and the shadow doesn&#x27;t crumble like many of the other shadows I have traveled with. Highly recommend! Also, my skin is very sensitive, and I have not had a problem.</li>
    <li> The pallet is lovely but beware: if you plan to use them dry, the colors are very faded. Apply wet and they look great.</li>
    <li> hardly picks up on the brush. So disappointed. :(&lt;br /&gt;I will look into their other pallets that have better reviews.</li>
    <li> I love the colors but it tood a while before I could get to a part of the eye shadow that would stick to a brush to show up on my eyes... once that happened I am completely happy w/ it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors! Great quality for the money.</li>
    <li> I was wondering why these were so inexpensive.  Althought they have a lot of pretty colors if you are not into glitter do not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> My eyeshadow came with 2 of them broken!!!</li>
    <li> 1 color arrived broken</li>
    <li> - not pigmented&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t show up very well&lt;br /&gt;- a lot of sparkles, but not too great&lt;br /&gt;- would not recommend</li>
    <li> This product was pretty disappointing... The pigment was very hard to transfer from the pallet to the brush and just didn&#x27;t deliver as an eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I bought this pallet after reading it was a good dupe for UD Naked but I can tell you definitely not a good dupe. The UD brand is worth the extra money compared to this shadow. First no applicator, pigmentation is poor and product does not apply as nicely as the more expensive brand. Save up for the good stuff!</li>
    <li> Colors are great, and a good cheaper alternative to more expense pallets</li>
    <li> This is a reasonably priced eyeshadow that works great.</li>
    <li> Does not spread well on the eyes, or gather on your makeup brush very well...hated it...gave it away to anyone who would take it just so I didn&#x27;t have to throw it out. Terrible product!!!</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is too sparkly. There is no way I have found to apply it without leaving the house with sparkles on my cheeks. The colors are quite muted too and not what I was looking for. It needs to be applied with a brush and not sponges.</li>
    <li> I like the colors but its because i have green/hazel eyes if i had brown eyes, the colors wouldn&#x27;t really make my eyes POP like i would want my eye shadow to do. They do not blend very well on your eye lid because, they are a very rough and course texture, so i wouldn&#x27;t hope to blend the light colors in the set with the dark colors.They are very sparkly, which is fun and if you wet a brush they make a nice eyeliner (but most eyeshadows do.)</li>
    <li> Good price and quality</li>
    <li> They are so shiny fell in love with the colors &amp;#60;3 :)</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors, but must be layed as they are rather sheer. LOTS of fallout though.</li>
    <li> I saw all of the great reviews on this palette, so I decided to try it.  For the price, I figured I couldn&#x27;t be disappointed.  Needless to say, I definitely was disappointed.  The eyeshadow is so baked on, you can&#x27;t get any on the eyeshadow brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would probably be good for a pre-teen, but not for an adult.</li>
    <li> I hated this product. The colors are not rich as they appear on the picture. I am a woman of color and non of the colors even show up on my skin. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> Love this palette!  It&#x27;s an amazing price for great colors!</li>
    <li> The colors look very pretty, even in person, however they are not pigmented at all. They do show up at all when you actually put it on without putting on 8 coats.</li>
    <li> Loved the colors of the eye shadow, but wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply it. It was harder than normal eye shadow to apply, but overall was a great product!</li>
    <li> It goes on very faint and you can hardly see the color.. It feels &#x27;cheap&#x27; which I guess if you buy it for this price you pay for what you get. I would recommend getting your eyeshadow brush wet before applying.</li>
    <li> It was late getting here but other than that very satisfied! Stays on the whole day without smearing off! Love the colors and the shimmer it leaves!</li>
    <li> love these colors they are great for a begining makeup artist. great value !</li>
    <li> Way more metallic than can be seen in the picture. It&#x27;s also quite hard to get the color onto a brush.</li>
    <li> in this pallet you will find yourshelf gazing in the mirror loving the way you look i have a medium skin tone color and it really makes your eyes stand out and look amazing there will be no regret on thaking this one back!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve the color. I&#x27;m glad I can find online hard to get in the store. Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Nice colors just doesnt wear all day</li>
    <li> I like the selection of slightly shimmer colors, nice to mix and match!</li>
    <li> Pretty awesome eyeshadow palette for the price! Love mine !!</li>
    <li> I have to wet my brush to get the shadow to show up on my eyelids, and I am very pale skinned.  I love the colors on the site, but many of them look like the same color in person.</li>
    <li> Adorable eyeshadows! Delivered pretty fast and in excellent condition! I totally recommend this product for all girls:)&lt;br /&gt;Can be used wet as well</li>
    <li> I rated this product 5 stars because of how much I enjoy and thoroughly use this product! Awesome quality and colors!</li>
    <li> It is good quality but smaller than what I was expecting. The picture does not reflect the actual size.</li>
    <li> If you want it to be noticeable, you have to apply it wet, which is a pain. It doesn&#x27;t last very long either. If you like very subtle make-up, you might be happy with this, and the shades are nice.</li>
    <li> The product I recieved had different colors than the online photo and had to be returned. On the plus side, Amazon made the return really easy!</li>
    <li> I love this product. You can make so many looks out of a palette like this, and it is so cheap. It came perfectly packaged, and delivered before the date. I will buy this again. (:</li>
    <li> I love this shadow, it goes with anything I wear and it is now the only one I use. My husband likes it on me as well and we have been married 50 yr&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> THis eye shadow is by far the best. I use to use the bare minerals eyeshadow. But now I use the e.l.f. baked eyeshadow everyday. It is perfect if you want to go from simple shadow and then spice it up and do a smokey eye. I highly recommend it. BUT..... it doesn&#x27;t come with a brush, so you need to either buy one or get an old used one.</li>
    <li> I find that this product is not very pigmented at all. I&#x27;ve used a sponge, brush and even my fingertips to apply and it is so sheer it barely shows up! I usually love elf products but I feel that this was just overpriced and junky.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, they are all neutral colors. applies easily not too soft, doesn&#x27;t scatter when brushed.</li>
    <li> This set is too sparkly for my taste. I cannot use it . In fact I haven&#x27;t even tried. I will be giving it to my grand daughters.</li>
    <li> Love this baked eyeshadow its a must have..It really looks well when you wear it and it has such beautiful colors to choose from. It comes in a pretty case so you can just put it in your purse.</li>
    <li> I ordered this not knowing anything about the brand or colors and absolutely love it. All of the shadows have a little glimmer effect but not over the top.  The quality of the make up is really good. It has the consistency of higher end brands - rich and almost dewy so it doesn&#x27;t crack or get all over the place.  This also makes it spread evenly and last throughout the day.</li>
    <li> one was broken but other than that good</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. the colors were super pretty and very natural. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that some colors are not very pigmented. Other than that I love it. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Its elf. Cheap but love te colors. If youre looking for something of decent quality at a good price and convenient to carry, this is it.</li>
    <li> Pretty colors just doesn&#x27;t go in dark it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of pigment would have to use a shade stick to get some color out of this</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful but They are too light doesn&#x27;t show on my pigmentation. It will be great for lighter skin people. So you see not that it&#x27;s not good ,  it&#x27;s just for me.  I do buy  more of elf anyway.</li>
    <li> I gave these a 4/5 because they are decent eye shadows. If you bake something the moisture has evaporated from the product thus, they will be dry when applied dry! It says you can apply these wet if you are looking for a deep foiled pigmented look. If you want just a bit of shimmer and color then sweep it on dry. You can even use your fingers to apply if you like. You do need decent brushes to pick up the color. Overall, the colors are beautiful although some are very similar. I like that about it because I can do a natural smokey eye for the day time and blend them very easily. For the price, it&#x27;s about getting what you can out of it and you can achieve some sexy looks with this palette with some patience.</li>
    <li> So I bought this palette on Wednesday, and it came in the mail on Friday which was sweeeeeet. The company (Yonelay) that sent it to me left a note thanking me for my business which I thought was nice and personable. Now, the eye shadow is packaged very well... It is not as pigmented as I would like it to be. However, I have not used it with water yet because I&#x27;m waiting for some makeup brushes to use it with. I&#x27;m hoping it looks better when I use it with water. If it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll write another review. Also, I recommend this for people with either dark blue eyes or dark brown eyes. I will definitely buy from the same company in the future and so should you. :)</li>
    <li> I got a bunch of these like 5 of them in my order, I was pleasantly surprised at that. Heres THE down low ladies, dry this is a lackluster yawn - tastic pointless pallette, add eye drops or setting spray and WHOABUDDY it&#x27;s be-u-tiful glistening copper shimmery chocolate glimmering cream plum shimmer and stunning rose gold are yours with this pallette and they are only a couple of dollars and a finger dabbed in eye drops away from being yours. Simply fantastic neutral power bomb of yes!</li>
    <li> I really do like the eyeshadow palette but I received it damaged.</li>
    <li> I love how much sparkle each one has but it&#x27;s kinda subtle. I think every color is really pretty. I use it day makeup but if you add more, it could be a little be dramatic for night. It gets a little messy, but done of the colors have broken. Love this product and would definetly purchase again, but it looks like it will last a long time</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful eye shadow pallete</li>
    <li> Great makeup palette!</li>
    <li> I love these baked eye shadows. The colors are gorgeous, blends well and easy to build upon if you want color that looks rich and luminous. All at a great price!</li>
    <li> Arrived timely.  Case is very good quality and I love the large mirror.  Love the shades.  I am using a primer with the shadows and I must say they stay on all day long.  I have oily skin so this is a real bonus for me.</li>
    <li> I typically find it hard to order eye shadow online because it can break so easily. This was packed perfectly!</li>
    <li> it is hard to apply to the eyes unless you use your finger. I tried using a brush, but the color won&#x27;t stay on it. So again the only way to put in on, is with your pinky.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of baked shadows. I guess I was expecting a bolder color when applied. I found that I have to use a sponge applicator that is wet in order to get enough color. Although the colors appear to be different shades, many of them are so close to the other you can&#x27;t really tell a difference.</li>
    <li> The colors are really pretty, metallic looking, very nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this through Sephora and was extremely disappointed. First of all, the colors are MUCH lighter than they seem to be. And not color-light, just that you can&#x27;t see that you put any on! The plum doesn&#x27;t look plum on. The silver looks just like the 1st, 3rd, and 4th colors on the top row.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the darker color (the dark brown next to the plum) is really the only color you can see on. After about an hour, the color clumps in the creases in the eyes when I use primer. When I don&#x27;t use primer, it &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; off. As in, I see the dust of it under and around my eyes. How embarrassing!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, bottom line, you can probably get something cheaper than this that actually wears better. I prefer Lorac when I have the money lol!</li>
    <li> Pretty colors, but they don&#x27;t stick to your eye very good. This set was inexpensive but I regret buying it</li>
    <li> I have purchased and used ELF great products at a great price.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I am new to e.l.f. products, but was interested in testing out these eye shadows because of the gorgeous colors.  They are easy to apply, but unfortunately, after a few hours, I felt as if the color had faded.  Again, the range of colors is truly beautiful on the palette, there was not a single one that I didn&#x27;t like, I just thought that they would be more vibrant on my skin.  I still think that this might be a quality product, especially for its affordability, and maybe these colors would last longer on other peoples&#x27; skin.  Also, I recommend using the foil technique (adding water to the eye shadow before applying) to increase its strength.</li>
    <li> The colors are pale and barely visible if you are not using water. When used with water the colors are bright and shiny and stay on for a long time.</li>
    <li> Ya..so happy when this order came..love the colors..I have to hide it from my teenagers. Love the way it makes my eyes look.highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Personally, I&#x27;m not really a makeup or fashion freak. I don&#x27;t know anything about the different types of makeup and whatever they do and such. But my best friends older sister, after my Palette came in the mail she was kind of freaking out because she said despite my lack of knowledge in the beauty department, she said I made a great buy. And after trying it out for myself, I agree with her. :) It was lovely!</li>
    <li> These are really gorgeous. I really like shimmery browns a golds so this was perfect. It does make the pallet and mirror dusty but I honestly don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> I like all the colors and how they look on my skin, but not too happy with how I received it.</li>
    <li> I love the sheer shades and the large mirror! The colors blend well together and stay true to their hue all day.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. Idk what all the fuss from other customers who purchased this saying the colors were very transparent. They show up great on me. Although I am very fair complected so maybe that has something to do with it. I do want to use it with water and see how much more dramatic and richer the colors look.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product for the price</li>
    <li> Horrible waste of money. Within five minutes of applying this eyeshadow my eyes started watering and burning. Cheap product with actual eye scratching glitter.</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliment on the looks I&#x27;ve been able to create with these colors. definetly worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Really pretty colors and they show up nicely. Lasts through out the day too. Like a previous person said that it does show up better when used wet.</li>
    <li> so in love with e.l.f. right now. When i opened the box i was like wow! love these colors.Now i have 2 elf baked eyeshadow palete i&#x27;ve to buy the other one. Love It!!</li>
    <li> Seriously awesome dupe of a Sephora palette I paid $30 for! Go elf! I was very impressed. They are also almost identical in shades even! I will admit that the quality isn&#x27;t as amazing as a sephora palette, but close. The pigments aren&#x27;t as rich as sephora, but you can definitely work with this palette!</li>
    <li> good for the price, i do prefer to use it with water because it last longer and it is also easier to pick up with a brush when its wet, it doesn&#x27;t last that long its the only down side other than that is okay.</li>
    <li> I bought this one as a sub for the more expensive set. I would just spend the money next time because it takes a lot of this one to get color out of it.</li>
    <li> For $10 this is a good palette. I feel like my brushes have a hard time picking up any pigment and I have to wear a thicker/lighter primer or base to get the colors to show up better. However for the price this is a pretty nifty palette, they are pretty metallic/glittery.</li>
    <li> Pretty colors but they go on very light. However if you put a primer on first and wet you brush the colors are a little more defined. I still have to use a few coats to attain my desired shade.</li>
    <li> The colors are so soft and beautiful. I love these colors!!~</li>
    <li> It is pretty light... I have to layer it on to get the color dark (or use it wet) but it works.</li>
    <li> I was not to happy with this purchase the palettes break of very easily too bad for my case this was a birthday gift and I was sad to see the shadows broken made the gift look very CHEAP.</li>
    <li> Nice case with lovely colors but they are too light when used without water and too dark with water for an older professional. Also to sparkly; not a frost.  Passed it on yo my daughter who loves the beautiful bold look.</li>
    <li> This is a must buy for the prices. If you have ever tried any other brand of Baked&lt;br /&gt;makeup this will hold up in comparison. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Colors are gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I just received this &amp; am actually very sad that it is all broken &amp; a complete unusable mess &amp; waste of money! It even spilled out all over my other things in the box. Six out of the 10 shades stayed unbroken, the other 4 are a crumbly, shimmery disaster &amp; I will be asking for a refund! I took a picture to prove how horrible it was. SO upset!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but the sparkles irritate my eyes when I use it. The colors are so beautiful, though. If your eyes aren&#x27;t sensitive I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!!!! Love the colors!!!</li>
    <li> Stays on ALL day and looks great!! Colors for night and day or u can mix</li>
    <li> Great colors, long lasting and in a easy to carry case. I would suggest this to anyone who wants a go-to palette</li>
    <li> Love this palette, all the colors are gorgeous! Easy to mix and match, but I only apply them wet as they are too light to use dry. But they last a long time and I always get complements! Just as good as my more expensive eyeshadow, unbelievable price. I will definitely buy more from the company.</li>
    <li> Just ok .. dint feel the colors blend in well or stay long</li>
    <li> I love the product, colors, etc.....but 3 of the colors were damaged/broken to where the domed look was flat when it arrived.</li>
    <li> As much as I love this type of eyeshadow, and the colors, I was a bit disappointed. When this pallette arrived, two of the domed shadows had broken loose and made a mess inside. I don&#x27;t know if it was during manufacturing or shipping. The colors however are lovely, luminous, and work well together. I will continue to buy this variety of Shadow, as I&#x27;ve not found it&#x27;s match for comfort, appearance, and ease of removal.</li>
    <li> I first tried elf products from Walmart.  I really, really liked them.  When I saw the selection here, I was so excited!!  When I got them home....I WAS SO EXCITED!! lol  Love all the products I have tried from elf so far....can&#x27;t wait to buy more :)</li>
    <li> very nice colors but it didnt show up very well on my tan skin, need darker colors and the shimmer was to big i perfer a finer shimmer for a softer look</li>
    <li> Product arrived sooner than I expected.  I really like the color combinations and I&#x27;ve received many complements from others concerning the shades that I&#x27;ve worn thus far.  I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow. I thought maybe, at first, that I wouldn&#x27;t because it looks so sparkly when I received it. Not so when I put it on. Looks subtle but I&#x27;ve only used it dry. Love all the colors and let&#x27;s see what it looks like wet (if I ever do that), but I am so very glad I bought it. Was looking at some of the reviews that it came &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; or such. Mine was perfect, I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and I use it everyday. Yay!</li>
    <li> Beautiful eyeshadows!</li>
    <li> I love the colors. I previously purchased a palette with different  colors I use everyday.</li>
    <li> Nice colors that blend well. Very reasonably priced and arrived on time. I usually use dry, but if you wet your brush a bit the shades really pop for a more dramatic look. Great if you like the smokey eye look that doesn&#x27;t end up looking like a black eye. Lol</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price. This is a great product! The neutral colors are so nice and they last all day.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow powder is pressed so firmly that it takes a thorough scrubbing to get any powder onto the brush. I was spending way too much time grinding off a bit of powder to apply before I just gave up.  Lovely colors, but low quality.</li>
    <li> love it - great colors</li>
    <li> I LOVE the colors and the quality best eye shadow ive had in a long time!!! Definatly would buy this product again</li>
    <li> Beautiful set of eyeshadow perfect for a night out!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, quality product. LOVE!</li>
    <li> These shadows are beautiful wet or dry.  Great pigmentation and lots of combination looks can be created with the colors included.  I purchased both the NYC and California color palettes.  I cross coordinate the colors between the two to create even more looks.</li>
    <li> I was quite excited for this but it came broken and a mess!</li>
    <li> AWESOME COLORS! Similar to the Naked Palettes but at a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice mini eye shadow kit. Comes with very nice colours and a lot of it too! Not like those cheap eye shadows you buy and you can only use each colour 10 times each. This is worth the buy but not the price. The price should actually be more, haha.</li>
    <li> The shadows are okay, but I wish they had a better balance of lighter and darker shades. The picture makes it look like there are several light shades to use as a base color on the lid, but really, only two of them are light enough to use like that. I also have to use quite a bit to get the lighter shades to show up at all.</li>
    <li> Has amazing colors but it flakes off a lot but I like it it work well if you have like a damp brush so it sticks better</li>
    <li> I received a demand today, but make-up broken😠👎🏻</li>
    <li> Colors are about all the same!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great purchase for the price. I love the natural look of the colors and that some are matte and some are shimmery. The compact is so nice and sturdy and I love the oversized mirror.</li>
    <li> very nice, dampen applier first for best color. Will buy again</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows have a great color/pigmentation, they are a little powdery but does not matter.&lt;br /&gt;I would use some with a damp brush to get different color. But I love them in general and will purchase again when I run out of them ;)</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted but unfortunately 7 out of 10 of the eyeshadows were broken when I received it.</li>
    <li> I love elf makeup already, this was my first time buying eye shadows from them, and I must say I was extremely happy with the results! The colors are great and last long! It definitely compares to the naked palettes, big thumbs up :)</li>
    <li> awesome! the shades are more pigmented, but thats sometimes what you want... Amazing when paired with the naked 2 palette</li>
    <li> Love the palette I tried it on yesterday &amp; you can either wear it wet or dry . I prefer wet it gives it more of a sultry look to your eyes</li>
    <li> Once again, it is hard to get the right color as computer display settings are so personal.  They were not the colors I visualized!  I&#x27;ve had this happen when ordering clothes.  Is not the sellers fault.</li>
    <li> I really like the colors in this palette, but don&#x27;t really like the way that it goes on. I use a eye shadow brush (you don&#x27;t get one with the set) and it seems to only last a couple of hours on my eyes. I get the powder from it all over the counter and under my eyes (sorry, not sure I am explaining that correctly).</li>
    <li> These are gorgeous earthy, natural colors.  The shadow stays on for hours, but unfortunately you have to purchase applicators or brushes to apply it separately.</li>
    <li> I really hoped it would be &amp;#34;shimmery&amp;#34; without being &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34; - but no such luck. Each of the colors has flake-y glitter in them, wet or dry. I have like e.l.f. items in the past and will again in the future, I&#x27;m sure, but this one definitely falls into &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; territory.</li>
    <li> I love that it arrived in 1 piece but also i love the shimmer from the glitter that this makeup has not to much and not to little just right i will totally buy this product  and others e.l.f. again !</li>
    <li> Perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate using wet and dry and both end up looking great.  No complaints, but would recommend using Too Faced eye shadow primer beforehand to make it last all day/night!</li>
    <li> Love it, just wish it was a little looser, not soooo compact. Other than that I love it!!!!!!!! Really nice colors!</li>
    <li> These colors are great and would flatter all skin tones. It&#x27;s a great buy for the money. I am absolutely ordering this set again.</li>
    <li> This palette is just fantastic. The colors are beautiful and pigmented. The colors go on smoothly and last throughout the day. Also this is a great price for a palette with great eyeshadows. I have already purchased one for me and my friend and I will be buying more in the future. Absolutely worth the $10 pricetag!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter very happy with this gift. I wondered if product made in China as I have read horror stories about toxic ingredients in eye shadows but she says this company a subsidiary of MAC and safe. Hope this is true. Anyway, she was overjoyed with it do it got 5 stars</li>
    <li> The colors barely show up and it&#x27;s more like colored glitter than eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Nice, but needs an applicator.</li>
    <li> I expected more. Barely can see on my eyelid. Have to really rubthe brush in.I even wet it didn&#x27;t help much.bummer</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette are very pretty, and the amount of shadow is impressive, for the price.  My complaint is that they are ALL VERY glittery.  I normally don&#x27;t mind a little shimmer, but these are a little much for every day wear.  They aren&#x27;t quite as smooth as I expected; the shimmer is just a little gritty.  I still use it occasionally, but I have to be careful how much I use because all that glitter makes me look like I&#x27;m 15...  I&#x27;m 26.. I&#x27;m not an old lady either. haha</li>
    <li> I own just about everything ELF. I swear by their products. But some of their eyeshadows hv been a hit and miss. This is one of those misses. Doesn&#x27;t even work well when u use it wet or with liquid primer or anything. for get about trying to use it dry. HATE HATE IT!!</li>
    <li> I ended up having to exchange these because they came broken, but I love the colors and they are exactly as the picture shows. They are a bit too metallic (shiny) though for my likings but my coworker loves them!</li>
    <li> Love it wet or dry.  Best eye shadow I&#x27;ve purchased in years.</li>
    <li> Although the colors seem neutral they are kind of bright and some are a bit overpowering than I like. But I  feel that it is good quality.</li>
    <li> Other reviews mentioned the colors were more glittery than they had expected so I knew it was going to be more glitter than just shimmer and it was exactly that. I was very happy with the colors and the ease of use. I would recommend to anyone that likes wearing glittery eyeshadows every now and then.</li>
    <li> this is a gift but and it looked beautiful</li>
    <li> Very nice thank you to upscale deal</li>
    <li> Colors are nice and apply well. I use a brush when I apply dry powder and a q-tip to apply wet for a bolder look. It is a little sparkly if you don&#x27;t like that sort of thing.</li>
    <li> Really like it. Just wish the colors were a little more intense. It arrived perfect and on time. I haven&#x27;t bought makeup online before.  Will definitely be doing it again.</li>
    <li> You will love the colors and the feel.  I am middle aged, yes, I can&#x27;t believe it either. Eye shadows can be harsh on your eyes now.  the e.l.f palette is great.  You can wear all the colors.  This is a great palette.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> i like these. i havent used all the colors. it takes a large appliance amount to actually see it. pretty good</li>
    <li> I love ELF but I hated these. They&#x27;re hard to use as they&#x27;re baked into an odd shape and are very hard.</li>
    <li> 20 y.o. daughter received item as Christmas gift and loves it!! Item was received promptly and in great condition! Thanks for offering a wide variety of sought after merchandise!!</li>
    <li> Love colors 4 stars because one of the lumps  broke off right when I got it.</li>
    <li> Colors are pretty but does not apply easily. It takes a lot to get the desired shade if you&#x27;re going for a dark look</li>
    <li> These colors go wonders with my hazel eyes , beautiful selection.</li>
    <li> Love these colors!&lt;br /&gt;Love all of elf cosmetics!&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful shades very simple but gorgeous</li>
    <li> used for every day wear perfect quality exactly what i wanted cheaper than on web site a must purchase yes</li>
    <li> Love the colors! ! And extremely well packaged.</li>
    <li> This pallete is great to pair with your other makeup. The quality it good and the shimmer is never overpowering. Although all of the colors are quite sparkley/mettallicy, these go great to shine up more matte colors. I usually use the two light cream shades and the orangey sunset color on my inner corners to add a touch of sparkle to my makeup. I personally love baked eyeshadows because I think they&#x27;re very versatile. These are everything I wanted and I will definiltey by again!</li>
    <li> Just as good as comps!  Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Not much pigment in theses shadows . I would  not recommend this product. Unless you are on a tight budget .. Don&#x27;t waste your cash.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the product on time as promised.</li>
    <li> Color doesn&#x27;t stay on, very bad quality</li>
    <li> Not deep colors,, i have to repeat 5 times to get the color!</li>
    <li> item was broken when I got in the mail a couple of the shackles were not broken so I tried them on and you can hardly tell that you&#x27;re wearing any eyeshadow on well at all would not recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> I bought this set of eyeshadows because I really liked the set of colors and the amount you get for the price. I&#x27;m usually a high end makeup buyer but I thought I would give it a try before I bought the Sephora palette. So far I really like it. The colors are pretty and if you use an eyeshadow primer they stay on for a long time. I would definitely recommend this palette.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I expected from the picture.</li>
    <li> Love it! But have to be careful, its easy to break if you travel. Beautiful colors and nice application.i have never been able to do the smokey eye effect, but it is easy with this pallet.  I will be buying this again when i run out! Love love love</li>
    <li> Very pretty shades , good value . Some shades were extremely neutral though , I have VERY fair skin and 2 of them could barely be seen</li>
    <li> This eye shadow goes on well and stays well but the colors are on the shallow side.</li>
    <li> I love the colors however once applied to the lid you need to layer colors. Pigment is too light. It does work better when applied wet.</li>
    <li> Great eye shadow kit for unbelievably low price!</li>
    <li> Ehhh I wasn&#x27;t expecting such glittery eyeshadow. It goes on great and stays on. Awesome eyeshadow for cheap!</li>
    <li> The colors pictured are not what you expect when you receive the product.  Shadow very hard to aplly to brush and very light not what I was hoping for at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors in this palette. I wish it had come with a brush, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem anyway.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Love how the colors were exactly what I was looking for:) Will definitely buy more from this brand.</li>
    <li> colors are misleading</li>
    <li> Not in love. The reviews were good, but I can barely see these pigments on my incredibly fair skin. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice, but this is a very glittery product.  Not really at all what I expected, but it isn&#x27;t terrible.  I&#x27;m just not a person who is into glittery make up.</li>
    <li> Elf cosmetics are great. They&#x27;re animal cruelty free, they come at a good price, and they&#x27;re decent products. I love how shimmery this pallet is and while it is shimmery it is not pigmented. I haven&#x27;t tried using it wet cause it is a baked eyeshadow and you can do that. I&#x27;ll have to try that out but all in all its a good buy.</li>
    <li> It goes on great but it will crumble if you are not careful and colors bleed together if dropped the shadow falls out easy! Do not recommend for young girls to play dress up!</li>
    <li> has to be the worst pallete I have ever bought not pigmented at all do not purchase you will regret.</li>
    <li> A waste of money if you expect actual color to show. I applied multiple layers many days, trying out the different colors, and I was disappointed. But hey, it&#x27;s cheap stuff, so what can you do? Bought some really great stuff called physicians formula if you really want some good bold color in these same hues.</li>
    <li> Great palette!  The colors are true and the shimmer is just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I was never a fan of baked eye shadow and as a makeup artist I like the colors but I find it difficult to put on. Love the brand and price.</li>
    <li> AGAIN NO APPLICATORS!!! AND a week and a half to arrive.  TRY YOUR DRUG STORE if you need something.</li>
    <li> Great colors, they all are sparkly though, wasn&#x27;t really expecting that.  I really like the container, too.  Wears well, and doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
    <li> Product was broken and eye shadows were smashed up on arrival.</li>
    <li> Awful. Couldnt get any on the brush to show up on my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this product is rated so highly. It&#x27;s absolutely terrible! I&#x27;m returning it for my $10 back because the product isn&#x27;t even worth that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even go on dry.. there is like, no pigment on the brush and even less on my eyelid. Wet really isn&#x27;t much better. Once the shadow is on your eye it looks nothing like how it doesn&#x27;t the palette!</li>
    <li> absolutely wonderful! and at a great price too. if u have beige skin like me, this looks great on your complexion! I will be ordering another one real soon.</li>
    <li> it is ok...pigment not the best but I liked it just the same</li>
    <li> i recieve my item with damage</li>
    <li> I have no idea exactly what baking the eyeshadow does but I know I love this palette. It has a mix of naturals and complementary colors that are great for blending and from what I&#x27;ve tried so far really have a rich pigment. All of them show bright without making you look clown-ish. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try all the colors yet but I&#x27;ve fallen in love with the ones I have.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like how hard it is to get the color on your brush. Not my fave</li>
    <li> Two of the eyeshadow were damaged &amp; it&#x27;s hard to open up. Will not order this brand again.</li>
    <li> The colors are natural colors...great shades in this palette. ...love the soft colors</li>
    <li> Too shimmery for my taste</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite eyeshadow palette. The colors are gorgeous and shimmery, just like I like them!</li>
    <li> This eye shadow was a huge disappointment. The colors didn&#x27;t show up at all. I put layer after layer of the plum on and it was barely noticeable. After several layers of the gold I finally got some pigmentation. I found these colors to be utterly worthless. With the price for what I will now pay to buy something else I could have gotten a decent product to start with. Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you want colors so subtle you aren&#x27;t sure you are wearing them.</li>
    <li> Colors are super glittery and thin. It also does not come with a brush/application stick. Great for the price but fell short of expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge ELF fan and was excited to try the baked palette.  I was very disappointed as the colors looked like they would be amazing but the pigments do not hold up on application. You can take many many swipes on a brush but the makeup doesn&#x27;t apply well at all. Very faint nothing like how it appears in the palette. This was a miss for ELF.</li>
    <li> Not quite as dark colors as the picture but good for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of the Sephora color compacts and while I really love it, I wanted to expand my colors at a cheaper cost.  Are they as fabulous as Sephora, no but they are nice for the price.  I find that I use the two in conjunction with one another for a good look.  I&#x27;m ready to order a second one of these in another color family and they are great for stocking stuffers for $10.</li>
    <li> Got this for stocking stuffers for my girls - they loved them!!! We love E.L.F. products and buy them all the time!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these eyeshadows.........so much so I ordered another set for my friend.......They are so easy to use and so pretty and go with everthing in your wardrobe.........</li>
    <li> For anyone wanting a glittery affect on their eyes this eyeshadow does this amazingly. It is great for an evening out or wanting a special look for a special occasion.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had a multitude of colors for such a cheap price. While the shadows may be small, they are nicely pigmented and when used with a primer they are great. Very good for the money conscious make-up lover or colorful college student.</li>
    <li> This is one of my MOST USED palettes. I ordered it directly from ELF during the 50% off everything. The baked colors are great and they are fairly pigmented. Great buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: My ordering experience with ELF was awful. I had a friend that placed her order two days after me and got her order a week before mine. Half my order was wrong and their office hours don&#x27;t seem to be correct. Customer service only replies with templated, vague responses. I got everything worked out eventually but I will never order from them again. It wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> Too much fallout,  color isn&#x27;t as pigmented as I hoped</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite eyeshadow palette ever. I&#x27;m extremely grateful for it and it&#x27;s low cost. I hope e.l.f. doesn&#x27;t figure out they could charge way more for this highly pigmented, gorgeous palette.</li>
    <li> I really like the colors. Very pretty. BUT, I have to use my finger to apply it to my eyes instead of my brush. My eye shadow brush cant even get a little bit of it. I used my fingers though and it works just as well. VERY pretty once you get it on.</li>
    <li> harder than expected (i.e. hard to put on) , also more sparkly. Still ok for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this on several occaisions.  Love the shimmer.  The lighter colors are great for wearing to work, and the darker ones are great for a night out!</li>
    <li> Found it cheaper in a store but that happens not quite the shades I thought it would be so a little disappointed but not too bad for the money</li>
    <li> This baked eyeshadow palette is, for the money, totally amazing. Shop around and see outrageous prices for similar items elsewhere. The lighter colors are perfect for casual wear, the brighter ones are great for making a statement. If you use a primer, you&#x27;ll get it to last longer and more in-depth color on your skin. I recommend using a brush, and if you use water in your application, you will get a powerful pop of color. Make no mistake, this is a bargain. Make sure you check out the e.l.f. website, unless you are planning on ordering lots of other stuff to take advantage of this \\&quot;add on.\\&quot; (Try the e.l.f. brushes as well for a real bargain!)</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow does not come off that well, but it was a good price. So not complaining!</li>
    <li> Just got it ! Package is a lot smaller than I expected, about an inch smaller than my hand but the colors are all so pretty and natural</li>
    <li> These colors do not show up at all on brown skin, nor does it shimmer, i was completely dissatisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product almost every day since I&#x27;ve purchased it.  Love the subtle colors - and can be worn with almost anything.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Putting it on wet is the best thing ever.&lt;br /&gt;When you let it dry use a blending brush to blend it out!! Love this pallet so much.</li>
    <li> At least half the colors are not very pigmented at all, even when applied with a wet brush. Was disappointed, because I thought this could&#x27;ve been a dupe for Sephora&#x27;s &amp;#34;In the Nude&amp;#34; baked eyeshadow palette. Sephora&#x27;s is much more pigmented and has good quality, but it&#x27;s so expensive.. Will probably be returning both.</li>
    <li> I bought these dispute reading the reviews that the colors are not that vibrant. I did use a little water and it helped a bunch. Prior to using water I felt like I would have been there all day trying to apply it dry. I think they are fun sparkly colors. I think for the price it&#x27;s ok, great to play around with the colors. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d recommend to someone one, I&#x27;d tell them what I know and let them choose for themselves.</li>
    <li> Really could not tell by pic they were mostly shimmering colors. Colors also not as intense as I am accustomed. Will be nice for weekend bag.</li>
    <li> Great colors.  Dark colors my be too light for dark skinned women.  e.l.f. makes great products I have the nyc shadow where the colors are deeper- particularly for dark skin.</li>
    <li> They definitely should be applied with water to get a deep color.  If not, they are very light.  But when I use a little water, they are nice.  Not bad for 10 dollars.</li>
    <li> I love the colors included in this palette, they&#x27;re neutral but shimmery which makes them fun. One problem I have though is that the colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented. It takes several layers of eye shadow to get the look of the actual shadow.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was packaged well. Came quickly and the color selection is pretty. However, when used as a dry shadow I have to use multiple coats for it to show up. I haven&#x27;t used it wet yet, but I am not a fan of wet shadows. A great price for the amount of colors though and very shimmery. At least worth a try for 10$ :-)</li>
    <li> Great colors, however, I was expect at least a couple shades to be matte, but they all are SUPER glittery.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried e.l.f. products. I was unaware it was a CVS line. I usually buy sephora shadows but, decided to try this because the colors are nice. I dont like it at all, the colors are very dull when applied. Sorry, this item is definitely not for me</li>
    <li> I have to hit the eyeshadow with the end of my brush to loosen it up a bit. It doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and I just wasn&#x27;t happy with it. It might work for everyone else though!</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they might be in line with the sephora baked pallets. not so. you cannot even use these dry, you have&lt;br /&gt;to get them wet first to use them. and then they become too thick and pasty when you put them on. save your money and pay a little more to get a better palette.</li>
    <li> Love the price for this eyeshadow palate and the fact that you get 10 shades, however I did find that the pigmentation wasn&#x27;t that great and there was quite a bit of fallout on my cheeks after application. I did use an eyelid primer and Mac&#x27;s fix plus to make the colors brighter and that seemed to help. Not bad for a $10 palate but probably won&#x27;t purchase again for myself or as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love this palette of eye shadow!! You can wear them very light or you can increase the color with a base coat. I am very please with my purchase!</li>
    <li> wasnt worth it. It didnt work very well</li>
    <li> Great colors came with it broken though so had to dump the excess.</li>
    <li> Hard to get any color to show</li>
    <li> Didnt really like the way it looks.once it was applied</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long before it wears off.</li>
    <li> Color is difficult to get on the brush. The color barely shows up. It&#x27;s very stiff.</li>
    <li> I have pale skin and these work. I put it on using my finger and it worked great. I would probably recommend a primer to hold it. The purple is more pale and the brown isn&#x27;t super dark but the gold are really shiny! I haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet but I&#x27;m glad I got it. Mine arrived one time but one of the corners was cracked and the shadows were shattered. Amazon replaced it same day and sent it next day to me. Very happy for the price!</li>
    <li> others have posted the pigment/color doesn&#x27;t stay.  I use Urban Decay eye primer and my color/pigment stayed all day and night.  Never had to touch it up.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the colors in this palette, they are beautiful! However, this palette isn&#x27;t bery pigmented. I will be purchasing the sephora palette similar to this to replace it. You get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty but too shimmery for my taste. You  have to apply alot for the color to actually shoe up. But its not expensive ao give ita try. Maybe it will work for you.</li>
    <li> I love these colors.  Every color on the pallette blends with the other colors.  They work really well as eyeliner if you wet your precision eyeliner brush before patting onto the color.  I love the metallic shades.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of fallout but I love the colors. I have used all of the colors on this pallets unlike other eyeshadow pallets I have.</li>
    <li> The colors in the California set really appealed to me, but when applying it, the colors are dull and not vivid.&lt;br /&gt;Its not worth the money.  I&#x27;ve gotten better sets from Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I have bought 6 of these already. I tried it myself and loved it so much that I bought five more as gifts. You can use these wet or dry depending on the look you want.</li>
    <li> a little too flakey and messy when applying brush to color pallet, but colors are beautiful and easy to apply and blend.</li>
    <li> This is a great little palette that lets you try many different shades. I used most of them wet to enhance the colors but it is nice to have options. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow! I apply it wet and it doesn&#x27;t crease like some of the other brands that I have tried. It is more shimmery than I first thought, but all of the colors look very nice. I am so glad I got this! It works especially well, considering how cheap it cost. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have every color of these palettes. The colors are vibrant and fantastic. I use them wet mostly, but they are also great dry. They remind me of the higher end brand&#x27;s baked eyeshadow. They are well packaged and the large mirror is great. I have one palette I have had for over a year (with almost daily use) and there is still quite a bit of eyeshadow left. These last a while. would recommend these to everyone!</li>
    <li> Wish it was not the powdered type but it&#x27;s nice still</li>
    <li> But also really pretty. Works best with application with fingers because using a brush is too messy. Also the packaging is nice</li>
    <li> This palette is perfect! The colors are beautifully pigmented (very glittery!) and apply really nicely dry, but you can also dampen your eyeshadow brush for an even more pigmented color, and it lasts all day! The palette itself feels well-constructed and more expensive than it actually is. I am a huge fan of Urban Decay and MAC eyeshadows, and these e.l.f. eyeshadows are definitely comparable! The only thing I would watch out for is fallout - because of the raised design, there is more fallout than most palettes. But for the price, this palette can&#x27;t be beat! Definitely would recommend to anyone that loves glittery, pigmented eyeshadow. :)</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend; not as dark as they look even with primer.</li>
    <li> As is, the color, when applied, is very thin/faint. The color does not show up or pop when applied. It&#x27;s like putting on a slightly glittery powder (not even enough glitter for an overcoat). Even when used with primer, no luck. However, as others have stated, if you get the eye shadow wet then you&#x27;ll get more color. However, I don&#x27;t find this ideal for a few reasons: 1) it&#x27;s hard to blend the color when it&#x27;s wet, 2) it&#x27;s difficult to use the wet color with a brush because the water dries too quickly so applying under the eye is not easy. You can&#x27;t put more water to make it stay wet longer because the shadow is domed upward. The most effective application is wetting your finger and rubbing it into the color, then applying with your finger. If you only want the color on your eye lid, not on the upper lid or below your eye then it&#x27;s probably fine. But I&#x27;d rather just get a shadow that&#x27;s more versatile and doesn&#x27;t require the extra effort.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is pretty good for the price. I wear one light tone to work during the day, then add the darker tones for some shading at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;Stays on all day&lt;br /&gt;Colors show up well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;Only looks good wet (you need a good set of wet brushes)&lt;br /&gt;Some of the colors in the set are almost identical (not much variety)</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting. Doesn&#x27;t apply well, have to use a lot to get desired results. Came in a timely manner and packaging was good!</li>
    <li> Love these shadows, look cute when mixed with something wet. Had for a looong time</li>
    <li> The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
    <li> I got a bunch of these like 5 of them in my order, I was pleasantly surprised at that. Heres THE down low ladies, dry this is a lackluster yawn - tastic pointless pallette,  add eye drops or setting spray and WHOABUDDY it&#x27;s be-u-tiful glistening copper shimmery chocolate glimmering cream plum shimmer and stunning rose gold are yours with this pallette and they are only a couple of dollars and a finger dabbed in eye drops away from being yours.  Simply fantastic neutral power bomb of yes! Repurchasing</li>
    <li> Excellent product, bright colors, excellent seller!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, The make up was hard. Not smooth. Gave to my Daughter for when she plays dress up.</li>
    <li> color has very little pigment. i should have went to my local walmart  or beauty supply . looks nothing like the shades on the pic.</li>
    <li> You have to apply the shadow multiple times before it even starts to show. It&#x27;s quite annoying and even then it&#x27;s pretty dull</li>
    <li> Love the product. Too bad half of the shadows were broken due to shipping.</li>
    <li> My daughter is in love with these colors. Every day she has a  new combination on her eyes and looks beautiful</li>
    <li> I love the colors so much! I used this everyday and I will cry when there&#x27;s no more. . .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! Stays on all day.</li>
    <li> very shear. havent tried using a color under it or wetting my brushh but without anything. u can barely see it</li>
    <li> Way too shimmery. The colors look great on the palette but look kind of messy on your eyes.</li>
    <li> love the colors but not convenient! VERY HARD TO APPLY</li>
    <li> Best seller and super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this palette for me as a gift. I had never used this brand before, but now I use it almost every day. I think it&#x27;s better than my usual powder shadow because it glides on nicely, looks beautiful, and lasts long. The colors are beautiful. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use primer and everything and I just don&#x27;t love this palette. I really have to work on packing on the color with these.</li>
    <li> bought it for my gf, she seems to like it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors! Exactly what I wanted! Super good price, love it!!</li>
    <li> Very nice eye shadows definitely must prime your eyes so it goes on so much nicer and bolder.</li>
    <li> The colors looked beautiful- however it was almost impossible to apply this product. Super cheap!!! I wouldn&#x27;t buy this for anyone or accept even if it was free. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> If you apply it dry you get mess under your eyes, if you apply with wet applicator it doesn&#x27;t stay long on your eyelids. Also these eyeshadows don&#x27;t have enough pigments, almost colorless when you apply</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! It was recommended to my by my sister and I have been so pleased. The shadow is high pigment and stays on remarkably long. It is such a great palette for the price!</li>
    <li> I love the ELF products and am enjoying the baked eyeshadow</li>
    <li> Not pigmented at all.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, but it falls out of the container very easily.</li>
    <li> This palette was overbaked. The shadow wouldn&#x27;t even come onto the brush. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love the colors! Very pleased</li>
    <li> love the texture and great colours</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to get it to go onto the brush to wear it! I don&#x27;t like it at all. The colors are very pretty though</li>
    <li> Like it. Good deal for the price</li>
    <li> Natural Tones should be the name chosen.  These are awesome for a mild makeup wearer to a heavy makeup wearer.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Yes the colors are a bit lighter than you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;But they still look nice.</li>
    <li> hope I&#x27;ll find someone to give this, honestly I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> The colors aren&#x27;t too bright and there&#x27;s plenty of eyeshadow in the palette.The only problem is that it it wears off relatively quickly</li>
    <li> I have tried to apply the shadow dry and wet and even though the colors look nice on the palette they don&#x27;t show up on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> Smaller then I expected but overall a great pallet! Love the colors!</li>
    <li> they all were broken within the second use</li>
    <li> It applied on good, I just need to put like 3 coats for the color to stay.</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty but my palette came with all the colors out of their compartments. The fine dust from the colors banging around was all over the place and it was completely unusable. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> A very nice eyeshadow selection for the price.</li>
    <li> Colors aren&#x27;t comparable to the Naked palette, but for the price this is a good deal. Works best when wet.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color and attractive love these colors so much that the color much seems clear and distinct...&lt;br /&gt; This beautiful shadows&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I like this eye shadow, it goes great with my blue eyes.  However, even though it was packed okay, one of the colors broke off and was floating around the case when I opened it.  It was bubble wrapped and placed in a brown envelope.  It may not have broken had it been put in a box.  In any case, they are nice shadows.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is best used wet. It looks stunning though! The color stays and is beautiful! I don&#x27;t like it as much dry.</li>
    <li> I own nearly every ELF product available through the website. I love the colors of the eye shadow palette BUT I wish they were slightly more pigmented. The individual shadows I purchased are very pigmented, so I&#x27;m not sure why the palette wouldn&#x27;t be, but they aren&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> This product is great, only bad part is that the eyeshawdows are very dusty, which makes the product container very dirty. It makes the mirror hard to see. This is an easy and fast fix though because I can just take a brush and clean it up quick. I can also put it on my eyelid because it is a pretty shade with hints of sliver and gold. The eyeshawdows are pretty good and show up great. They are just perfect and are really worth only 10.00.</li>
    <li> love this as a dupe for the sephora baked pallets! Easy to apply with a damp flat shadow brush. wouldn&#x27;t recommend it dry only because then it is flakey and doesn&#x27;t stick to your lid. with water it is there like glue and creates an awesome finish.</li>
    <li> Wonderful color sets!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy! The eyeshadow won&#x27;t even go on!</li>
    <li> I love e.l.f but this eyeshadow isn&#x27;t very good. Doesn&#x27;t come out good, but that&#x27;s coming from a makeup artist</li>
    <li> I love the colors in this palette they are so nice, the only bad thing about this is that when I opened my package one of the pigments was ruined. They should be MORE CAREFUL other than that I love it!</li>
    <li> Worst makeup palette ever. It irritated my eyes.</li>
    <li> The colors are great and the application is easy. I love the shimmer in the eye shadows. I would certainly buy this again.</li>
    <li> Just eye irritation but its okay. I love it anyway.</li>
    <li> I love the colors. Recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I did like colors but the pigment was not that great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very dissapointed with how I received my purchase. The shadows were broken as you can see in the photo. I just want one that isn&#x27;t busted.</li>
    <li> Love the shadow and the colors for the most part. Package arrived right on time.. But 4 of the colora were completely smashed up.. and all over the inside of the palette. So im giving it 3 stars because no were on the packaging said fragile. I will no longer be ordering eye shadows unless they are already in loose power form.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows are amazing! the only thing is that the kit doesn&#x27;t have any brush or applier whatsoever, still rocks though</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not as shimmery as I hoped.</li>
    <li> I love makeup so I was very excited when this arrived. I was somewhat disappointed as I thought spending a little extra $ would get me a much more quality product. I guess I will differ from the other reviews and say I was not that impressed. I thought the colors would be more defined. I found myself putting alot more on my brush to just get the color to show on my lids. Unfortunately I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> The makeup came broken up into pieces and I was not able to give this item as a gift :(</li>
    <li> Colors are very light and do no blend well. But it is e.l.f. and if your willing to take the time to layer it up, maybe it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
    <li> The colors in this set are beautiful, but the coverage is very light. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the worst set ever.  The shadows are very hard and no color gets onto the brush.  Waste of money.  No pigment in the shadows either.</li>
    <li> Love the shades of the shadows. Love using the this.</li>
    <li> Good selection of shades but I did not expect them to be so glittery. I was looking for a softer shimmer I guess. When I tried this the eyeshadow made a mess and I spent more time cleaning up my face with eye makeup remover. With all the glitter I thought maybe it would be useful for a night out but it gives you racoon eyes after an hour or two.</li>
    <li> These are just as nice or nicer than the expensive eye shadow I have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> Used this wet for a wedding everyone LOVE my eyes and thought it looked awesome. Very light for day to day but a good pallet for wet use for evening/events.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t apply as well as I expected.  Won&#x27;t likely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye shadow palette!!! It allows you to make combinations that will go with any type of event. I love how I can go from casual to night out with this palette. By far the best purchase I&#x27;ve made. If you like shimmery eye shadow that will make your eyes pop, this is the palette for you. I use it with water, so it makes the color even better!</li>
    <li> Love the variety of shades and the price is great!</li>
    <li> what a nice variety and good price</li>
    <li> You can barely see this when you put it on, even the dark colors, not worth buying.</li>
    <li> These were so much more classy and quality than I even expected...very nice</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous, but it takes a lot of elbow grease to apply enough to show.  Most of the powder is wasted in a dusty mess all around the shadows, and not on your eyes.</li>
    <li> No offense it looks really good.. I like the color  .. but the problem it doesn&#x27;t apply very well.. You need to brush It many many times.. For me Not worth the price.. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this it only looks good but It&#x27;s a BiG NAH</li>
    <li> Love the colors this make up is great</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS AND IT CAME WITH FOUR PALETTES</li>
    <li> exactly what was described and i was looking for! fast shipment!</li>
    <li> Nice colors. Quality it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I really love all the shimmery colors but it is very messy.</li>
    <li> Awesome with primer..</li>
    <li> very economical. I bought it because I am new to baked eyeshadow and want to try it out without investing too much. This was quite economical and had 10 shades. I used it once and was fine with the quality.</li>
    <li> I was recommended baked shadow because you can use it wet or dry. Other brands were pretty expensive so I opted for this one. If you use it dry the pigments are pale but wet it&#x27;s bright and shiny! I think it&#x27;s a steel for what I paid!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping..excellent product!</li>
    <li> They stay on really well and vibrant with water. Alone they are hard to see. They stay on well though.  Came in perfect condition</li>
    <li> I bought this palette as a gift set for friend just starting to use make-up and she absolutely loves it. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really really nice. I bought it with 2 concealer palettes as well that I use for contouring and they&#x27;re both really good.</li>
    <li> Very little pigment. Disappointed</li>
    <li> For the price, I cannot ask for more. The down-side is that I must reapply but not much. Nice to carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> The picture gives the look of soft pinks and whites and richer browns and purples. The only thing accurate was the brown and the bottom right purple. The pinks were actually both almost the same exact shade of white, and the one that looks a little mauve is an ugly dirt brown color.</li>
    <li> The packaging is nice, it looks good...but thats about it. The shadows are not very pigmented at all, there is a lot of fall out as well, I mean everywhere! They are nice colours but you don&#x27;t get very much effect when applied to your skin. They definately work better when wet, but I didn&#x27;t want them for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Not as pigmented as I was expecting but decent pallet</li>
</ol>
