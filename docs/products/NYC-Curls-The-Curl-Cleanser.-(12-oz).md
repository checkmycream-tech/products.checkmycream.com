      <li>Once a week - 3 rinses;  the hair feels great</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner are great.</li>
      <li>I did not buy the accompanying conditioner, and that may be why I did not find it great.</li>
      <li>Amazing!  </li>
      <li>It is also good for the skin.</li>
      <li>I liked this: it smells good</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m sure you will see the results like I have!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I just love this product line!  </li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
      <li>I really liked all three products in the range (cleanser, conditioner and styling gel).</li>
      <li>I received many compliments after using as to how healthy and shiny my hair looked.  </li>
      <li>Also no curl definition even when leaving in most of the conditioner and using the gel as recommended.</li>
      <li>love, love, love this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Product is okay for my hair.  </li>
      <li>My curls come out healthy and bouncy with no frizz.</li>
      <li>I would love to also use it for my children.</li>
      <li>Shampoo is okay</li>
      <li>and it DID NOT work better than my Deva Curl line.  </li>
      <li>I would restructure the product for better usage.</li>
      <li>They are so light and fresh, do such a good job of detangling, and smell so delicious.</li>
      <li>i love how easy it is to work through my hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered all 3 products in the line hoping that it would work on my very fine, super frizzy but corkscrew curly hair.</li>
      <li>and I can easily detangle with this cleanser.</li>
      <li>The products seem to moisturize nicely, but the frizz is out of control - like really out of control!</li>
      <li>The delivery was quick and painless!</li>
      <li>This has a great clean, fresh smell, is easy to work through and leaves my hair feeling silky and soft after I rinse.</li>
      <li>I am glad all his years of  &#x60;trial and error&#x27; with other products has paid off and allowed him to create these great products.</li>
      <li>You can get them delivered here from his own website but the delivery charges are v high (not his fault).</li>
      <li>Like many others, the challenges with the squeeze with my first bottle, and also the consistency of it put me off a bit.</li>
      <li>Please consider changing the container to a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; squeeze friendly product.</li>
      <li>Remember to scrub your scalp with it - that&#x27;s what gets your hair clean.</li>
      <li>NYC Curls Cleanser, Conditioner and Gel are simply the best I have ever used (and I have tried all of the major salon and drug store curly brands).</li>
      <li>I used Deva-chan No Poo for a long time, and loved it.</li>
      <li>For my erratic wavy hair, these products are a real dream come true!</li>
      <li>I find NYC cleanser so much better then many of the other silicone free cleansers I have tried.</li>
      <li>Thanks Carlos!!</li>
      <li>Carlos really is an expert!!</li>
      <li>My hair is easy to manage, my curls are soft &amp; healthy looking that even my hairstylist compliments me on how soft my hair is &amp; loves the curl my hair holds.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine type 3a/3b Caucasian hair, and this stuff caused instant tangles and mats</li>
      <li>After years of cowashing, It is refreshing to run into a shampoo that actually cleans your hair without drying it out.  </li>
      <li>It is cheaper but just as effective as other cleansing conditioners I have tried at much higher prices.</li>
      <li>Reading all the positive reviews makes me think I got a defective product.  </li>
      <li>smells great and does not dry out my hair or weigh my curls down.  </li>
      <li>and it cleans curly hair gently.</li>
      <li>Thank God for Carlos - he really understands curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I will never trust new hair or beauty products from Amazon again!</li>
      <li>I immediately went back to Deva Curl the following day and my hair felt so much better.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products.</li>
      <li>After using it for a few weeks I noticed such a positive change in the body, curl, texture, look and feel of my hair, I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>Most hairdressers do it wet and totally mis-judge things.</li>
      <li>you get a perm&amp;#34; because my curls were so clearly defined.</li>
      <li>My curls are soft and bouncy.</li>
      <li>These two products really has worked for my dry frizzy hair that I had all my life.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly and dry hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless no poo products on my naturally curly hair, and this stuff beats them all for performance and price.</li>
      <li>They left my hair soft, shiny and curly.</li>
      <li>My naturally curly hair loves the NYC Curls Cleanser &amp; Conditioner which I have used for several years now.  </li>

<li> They left my hair soft, shiny and curly.</li>
<li> My naturally curly hair loves the NYC Curls Cleanser &amp; Conditioner which I have used for several years now.  </li>
<li> I also use on my 5 year old daughter, who had delicate, medium curly hair and sensitive skin, and she loves them too!</li>
<li> Smells strange.  </li>
<li> that can leave hair feeling dry after use.</li>
<li> This product cleaned well, but left my hair a dry frizzy mess.  </li>
<li> It leaves in the curls and especially if you use the conditioner liberally and a little of the gel and follow the directions on its site-nyc curls.com.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t get a larger bottle, and I wish it had a pump.</li>
<li> I have had absolutely no problems with this cleanser.  </li>
<li> The bottle gets  slippery when wet.</li>
<li> And the plastic bottle is so hard I could barely squeeze it</li>
<li> I have used other cleansers of this type.</li>
<li> But at some point I ran out of other product and decided to try it again.</li>
<li> I have not had to use a conditioner with other cleansers and did not expect to with this.  </li>
<li> , made my hair flat and hard to dry because product was so oily feeling</li>
<li> I was skeptical about this cleanser because of the price, but I found it to be worth the money after I used it for a few days.</li>
<li> He is also one of the few to cut curls when they are dry.</li>
<li> The frustration of getting the product out of the bottle is definitely not worth it.  </li>
<li> The cleanser does not foam up like other shampoos but after reading about the product on NYC Curls website it explains why &amp; it works for me!  </li>
<li> No more dry frizzy curls - now they glisten.  </li>
<li> I switched to NYC Curls a few months ago.  </li>
<li> Other curly girl shampoos I&#x27;ve tried are hard to massage through my thick hair, but not this product.</li>
<li> The bottle is a little hard to dispense</li>
<li> I like the product a lot but not sure I would purchase again.</li>
<li> Hard to squeeze product out.  </li>
<li> Not a good way to start each morning.  </li>
<li> Very hard to squeeze out of the bottle have to take off the lid.  </li>
<li> However, the plastic container is so hard, that it is VERY difficult to get the product out of it&#x27;s container.</li>
<li> Did I mention it&#x27;s expensive?  </li>
<li> I bought the trio - Cleanser, Conditioner, and Gel and was NOT impressed by this line</li>
<li> WRONG.  </li>
<li> As others said, the bottle is difficult to work with in the shower, but hey, you could build some hand strength.  </li>
<li> but the bottle is way too difficult to handle in the shower.  </li>
<li> I have used the NYC Curls products for a few days and am very disappointed.</li>
<li> so bad I had to cut some of them out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> made my hair look and feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Also, made my hair flat and hard to dry because product was so oily feeling</li>
    <li> Hard to squeeze product out.  Bottle too large and stiff.  I like the product a lot but not sure I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is okay but the bottle is way too difficult to handle in the shower.  The bottle gets  slippery when wet. Bottle doesn&#x27;t have enough give to squeeze out the shampoo.</li>
    <li> love, love, love this cleanser.  smells great and does not dry out my hair or weigh my curls down.  Carlos  you are great!</li>
    <li> Thank God for Carlos - he really understands curly hair.  His products are the best I&#x27;ve used yet, and I&#x27;ve used most of them!</li>
    <li> My naturally curly hair loves the NYC Curls Cleanser &amp; Conditioner which I have used for several years now.  These two products really has worked for my dry frizzy hair that I had all my life.  My hair is easy to manage, my curls are soft &amp; healthy looking that even my hairstylist compliments me on how soft my hair is &amp; loves the curl my hair holds.  The cleanser does not foam up like other shampoos but after reading about the product on NYC Curls website it explains why &amp; it works for me!  The bottle is a little hard to dispense but I found a pump to go on it.  Give the product time to show results maybe 6 months or so &amp; I&#x27;m sure you will see the results like I have!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used other cleansers of this type. They left my hair soft, shiny and curly. This product cleaned well, but left my hair a dry frizzy mess.  I have not had to use a conditioner with other cleansers and did not expect to with this.  WRONG.  If you buy this, buy the conditioner.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> After years of cowashing, It is refreshing to run into a shampoo that actually cleans your hair without drying it out.  Curls stay beautiful</li>
    <li> that can leave hair feeling dry after use. This has a great clean, fresh smell, is easy to work through and leaves my hair feeling silky and soft after I rinse. i love how easy it is to work through my hair. Other curly girl shampoos I&#x27;ve tried are hard to massage through my thick hair, but not this product. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Reading all the positive reviews makes me think I got a defective product.  I have very fine type 3a/3b Caucasian hair, and this stuff caused instant tangles and mats so bad I had to cut some of them out.  No slippage whatever.  And the plastic bottle is so hard I could barely squeeze it (and I&#x27;m no wimp).  Did I mention it&#x27;s expensive?  It is.  And I threw it out.  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are great. My curls are soft and bouncy. Is this a \\&quot;no tear\\&quot; product? I would love to also use it for my children. I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> I used Deva-chan No Poo for a long time, and loved it. So switching NYC Curls was an experiment. Like many others, the challenges with the squeeze with my first bottle, and also the consistency of it put me off a bit. But at some point I ran out of other product and decided to try it again. After using it for a few weeks I noticed such a positive change in the body, curl, texture, look and feel of my hair, I was thrilled. Now I&#x27;m using both this and the NYC Curls conditioner and I&#x27;m very happy. For my erratic wavy hair, these products are a real dream come true! Thanks Carlos!!</li>
    <li> This made my hair and skin feel oily and disgusting! It also makes me itch! I will never trust new hair or beauty products from Amazon again!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this cleanser because of the price, but I found it to be worth the money after I used it for a few days. My hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Smells strange.  Very hard to squeeze out of the bottle have to take off the lid.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Product is okay for my hair.  I would give it a 6 on a scale of 1-10.  The frustration of getting the product out of the bottle is definitely not worth it.  Not a good way to start each morning.  I would restructure the product for better usage.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I switched to NYC Curls a few months ago.  Since then people come up to me to comment on my curls.  No more dry frizzy curls - now they glisten.  If my curls are happy, I am happy!  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this product! The delivery was quick and painless!</li>
    <li> I just love this product line!  This cleanser does not foam but it is not &#x27;sposed to.  I have had absolutely no problems with this cleanser.  It leaves in the curls and especially if you use the conditioner liberally and a little of the gel and follow the directions on its site-nyc curls.com.</li>
    <li> I ordered all 3 products in the line hoping that it would work on my very fine, super frizzy but corkscrew curly hair. I have used the NYC Curls products for a few days and am very disappointed. The products seem to moisturize nicely, but the frizz is out of control - like really out of control! Also no curl definition even when leaving in most of the conditioner and using the gel as recommended. I am returning all 3 products for a refund. Back to DevaCurl and DevaCare I go...</li>
    <li> this non-sudsy &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; did wonders for my hair.  I received many compliments after using as to how healthy and shiny my hair looked.  Everyone asked &amp;#34;did you get a perm&amp;#34; because my curls were so clearly defined.</li>
    <li> I liked this: it smells good and it cleans curly hair gently. I did not buy the accompanying conditioner, and that may be why I did not find it great. It is cheaper but just as effective as other cleansing conditioners I have tried at much higher prices.</li>
    <li> I find NYC cleanser so much better then many of the other silicone free cleansers I have tried. I have very curly and dry hair and I can easily detangle with this cleanser. Remember to scrub your scalp with it - that&#x27;s what gets your hair clean. It is awesome - and it smells sooo good too! Carlos really is an expert!!</li>
    <li> Once a week - 3 rinses;  the hair feels great and I am set for the week.It is also good for the skin.</li>
    <li> NYC Curls Cleanser, Conditioner and Gel are simply the best I have ever used (and I have tried all of the major salon and drug store curly brands). They are so light and fresh, do such a good job of detangling, and smell so delicious. My curls come out healthy and bouncy with no frizz. I also use on my 5 year old daughter, who had delicate, medium curly hair and sensitive skin, and she loves them too!</li>
    <li> I really liked all three products in the range (cleanser, conditioner and styling gel). Carlos comes to London 3-4 times a year to cut my hair. I trust him as he has had curls himself. He is also one of the few to cut curls when they are dry. Most hairdressers do it wet and totally mis-judge things. I am glad all his years of  &#x60;trial and error&#x27; with other products has paid off and allowed him to create these great products. I had a friend visit NY so I had them delivered to the hotel as its not possible to get them delivered to London (at the moment via Amazon) but hopefully that will change soon. You can get them delivered here from his own website but the delivery charges are v high (not his fault).</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. However, the plastic container is so hard, that it is VERY difficult to get the product out of it&#x27;s container. Please consider changing the container to a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; squeeze friendly product.</li>
    <li> I bought the trio - Cleanser, Conditioner, and Gel and was NOT impressed by this line and it DID NOT work better than my Deva Curl line.  I can only describe the smell as being like Vapo Rub.  Even my boyfriend agreed.  As others said, the bottle is difficult to work with in the shower, but hey, you could build some hand strength.  I used this once and will not be using it again.  I immediately went back to Deva Curl the following day and my hair felt so much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless no poo products on my naturally curly hair, and this stuff beats them all for performance and price. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t get a larger bottle, and I wish it had a pump.</li>
