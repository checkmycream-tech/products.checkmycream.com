      <li>The silicone nipple covers are great!</li>
      <li>Wonderful product!  </li>
      <li>good product to avoid embarrassing moments!</li>
      <li>Works great for the shoe liners.  </li>
      <li>Great for a backless dress and use with the lift tape.</li>
      <li>This product is great fashion accessory to use.  </li>
      <li>Bought these to wear with a backless dress...worked great.  </li>
      <li>Great product, doesn&#x27;t show at all.</li>
      <li>and they work perfectly , just wished I got more for the money.</li>
      <li>Good price for the amount and product.  </li>
      <li>Served the purpose well!!&lt;br /&gt;And very comfortable to wear!</li>
      <li>Love em!</li>
      <li>But when it&#x27;s time to take them off, they peel off nicely.  </li>
      <li>These are nice but not reusable.  </li>
      <li>I was excited as it had so many great reviews</li>
      <li>Thank you Hollywood Fashion secrets for making my life easier and filled with strapless dress!</li>
      <li>Though this product did not conceal my h.n. 100%, it was 75% better than being fully free.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are a must-have for warmer months, or whenever I can&#x27;t wear undergarments under a dress or top.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping these would work better for travel</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used better</li>
      <li>and they work much better.  </li>
      <li>Provides more coverage than band-aids and are more easily removed without any irritation.</li>
      <li>The problem with this product is that it is just too sticky and does not come off easily.</li>
      <li>Seem to work fine.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>Also a nice way to keep an overly drapery blouse from draping to far to one side.</li>
      <li>It must be true that the Hollywood stylists depend on them.</li>
      <li>Not seeing through my white dress any more!</li>
      <li>This is a good product however, really stays put and offers a modest look while going bra-less.</li>
      <li>I ordered both the no-show concealers and the silicone pads at the same time to test out which will function better.</li>
      <li>And unlike other products comes off easy and doesn&#x27;t give you an allergic reaction to the tape side!</li>
      <li>This is a decent product!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m the type of girl that hates wearing a whole bra</li>
      <li>The silicone pads provide a bit more contour; whether that&#x27;s good or bad&#x27;s up to you.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend, only slightly better than actual tape.</li>
      <li>me, the product is too pricey for 5 pairs; so I won&#x27;t be buying these often and only use when I really need to be conservative for outfits that don&#x27;t look right with bras.</li>
      <li>I wore once for 5 hours and had no issue taking off; wore another time over night (probably a total 13-14 hours) and it was a little more adhered to me, but not hard to take off.</li>
      <li>do have sensitive skin, even around my areola</li>
      <li>I nearly ripped my nipples off removing these, and they took some skin with them.  </li>
      <li>Turns out this one-time-go concealers provide a better coverage, you can hardly see any protrusions even on a thin fabric tank top.</li>
      <li>I found that these did not really provide much coverage</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind my ladies being free, but my nipples are almost always hard, so going bra-less in sheer tops</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not enough padding where the nipple should be (my nipples are not large), so the sticky stuff is on your actual nipple, and it&#x27;s REALLY sticky.  </li>

<li> Other reviews said these were hard to take off, but I found no issue.</li>
<li> they are very small (and I believe I have am average size Arreola)  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I had 2 send these back because they damage my delicate nipple tissue.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t cover anything, too thin.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve also used way worse.  </li>
<li> feel uncomfortable.</li>
<li> Even after a crazy night, a wedding, or a day in sun, they don&#x27;t budge.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s getting cold</li>
<li> They were Extremely PAINFUL to remove!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good price for the amount and product.  I&#x27;ve used better but I&#x27;ve also used way worse.  This is a decent product!  I would get this again and again.</li>
    <li> I was excited as it had so many great reviews and I&#x27;m the type of girl that hates wearing a whole bra so I thought these would be ideal.&lt;br /&gt;WRONG!!  One.  they are very small (and I believe I have am average size Arreola)  Two.  They were Extremely PAINFUL to remove!  I want my money back for this torture.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s getting cold and I need these and they work perfectly , just wished I got more for the money.</li>
    <li> Bought these to wear with a backless dress...worked great.  Would definitely purchase these again, and other products by this brand.</li>
    <li> These are the devils work.  Do not use unless you have pea sized nipples that will not come in contact with the sticky part.  They last long, but they are paper thin, and having to remove them is pure torture!</li>
    <li> What can I say? These are just a necessity.  I won&#x27;t try another brand. These are fantastic.  Even after a crazy night, a wedding, or a day in sun, they don&#x27;t budge. But when it&#x27;s time to take them off, they peel off nicely.  Love em!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover anything, too thin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those backless shirts! And unlike other products comes off easy and doesn&#x27;t give you an allergic reaction to the tape side!</li>
    <li> Not seeing through my white dress any more!</li>
    <li> These are nice but not reusable.  I prefer the silicone cover ups. This is a good product however, really stays put and offers a modest look while going bra-less.</li>
    <li> These little flower shaped covers look natural and work well with the lift tape. Great for a backless dress and use with the lift tape.</li>
    <li> They do not work well. They wrinkle and lack adhesive to properly stick to your skin.  I have the gel/silicone covers from the same company and they work much better.  I was hoping these would work better for travel but no.</li>
    <li> I use this to hold up short shoe liner socks, on the tops of over the knee socks, and on some lighter strapless dresses.  Works great for the shoe liners.  Also a nice way to keep an overly drapery blouse from draping to far to one side.</li>
    <li> good product to avoid embarrassing moments!</li>
    <li> The problem with this product is that it is just too sticky and does not come off easily. Removing it takes sharp pulls and it hurts. I tried taking it off in the shower, but it still leaves glue traces behind, which is another big annoyance with this. Would not recommend, only slightly better than actual tape.</li>
    <li> Served the purpose well!!&lt;br /&gt;And very comfortable to wear!</li>
    <li> I ordered both the no-show concealers and the silicone pads at the same time to test out which will function better. Turns out this one-time-go concealers provide a better coverage, you can hardly see any protrusions even on a thin fabric tank top. The silicone pads provide a bit more contour; whether that&#x27;s good or bad&#x27;s up to you. Thank you Hollywood Fashion secrets for making my life easier and filled with strapless dress!</li>
    <li> This product is great fashion accessory to use.  Provides more coverage than band-aids and are more easily removed without any irritation.</li>
    <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t show at all.</li>
    <li> These are a must-have for warmer months, or whenever I can&#x27;t wear undergarments under a dress or top.  It must be true that the Hollywood stylists depend on them.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Seem to work fine.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I had 2 send these back because they damage my delicate nipple tissue. Wanted 2 get the silicone covers but they were out if stock. The silicone nipple covers are great!</li>
    <li> I found that these did not really provide much coverage so I won&#x27;t be using them again, but they stuck firmly and they did not hurt at all to remove.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a torture device this is it!  Made my nipples hurt for days.  I nearly ripped my nipples off removing these, and they took some skin with them.  There&#x27;s not enough padding where the nipple should be (my nipples are not large), so the sticky stuff is on your actual nipple, and it&#x27;s REALLY sticky.  DO NOT BUY THESE!  (unless you&#x27;re into that sort of thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try these instead:Fashion Forms Women&#x27;s Extreme Silicone Breast Petals</li>
    <li> The dress for my son&#x27;s wedding was shoulder less on one side.  The tape kept the dress from sliding down.  I taped the dress to my staples bra.</li>
    <li> Other reviews said these were hard to take off, but I found no issue. The recommendation on the package is to wear these only for 4-6 hours or less. I wore once for 5 hours and had no issue taking off; wore another time over night (probably a total 13-14 hours) and it was a little more adhered to me, but not hard to take off. Of course every body is different, and would follow the company&#x27;s recommendation first.&lt;br /&gt;I also felt no residue left on me.&lt;br /&gt;I do have sensitive skin, even around my areola I get zits and have dry skin - and this product did not cause me to have any reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I am a C cup - never pregnant - and almost 30 (breast still perky). I don&#x27;t mind my ladies being free, but my nipples are almost always hard, so going bra-less in sheer tops feel uncomfortable. Though this product did not conceal my h.n. 100%, it was 75% better than being fully free.&lt;br /&gt;To me, the product is too pricey for 5 pairs; so I won&#x27;t be buying these often and only use when I really need to be conservative for outfits that don&#x27;t look right with bras.</li>
