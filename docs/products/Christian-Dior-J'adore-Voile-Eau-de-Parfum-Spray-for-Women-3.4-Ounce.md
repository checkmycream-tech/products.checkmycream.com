      <li>wife says this is not the real item ... thinks it is a knock-off ....</li>

<li> Thus, I don&#x27;t feel it lasts long at all.  </li>
<li> Due to some past reviews I was hoping it would be the same scent I was looking for, and it is!</li>
<li> Seems a little stronger than the sample I tried in the store, but I still like it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27; a little pricy</li>
<li> have used this perfume before and this one smells different. :(</li>
