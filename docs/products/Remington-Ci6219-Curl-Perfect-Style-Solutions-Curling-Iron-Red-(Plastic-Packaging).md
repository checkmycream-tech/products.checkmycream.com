<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There was no box or directions at all. It came in a clear plastic bag.</li>
    <li> Tried this one but didn&#x27;t work for me. The curls are too big, too lose and don&#x27;t stay in my hair longer than a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;If someone needs that loose curly look go for it, get this curling iron, most likely you&#x27;ll love it. Not for me though.</li>
    <li> PERFECT FOR MY 13 YR OLD. IT IS VERY EASY TO USE AND DOES NOT BURN HER FINGERS. GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I always had trouble trying to curl my hair with a regular curling iron. With this one, even someone with NO hair skills whatsoever like me, can get beautiful curls easily ! Love it !!!</li>
    <li> My review might not be fair to everyone. So keep in mind this is a review for those of us with long hair. My hair is waist length though my moms hair is about 10 inches shorter than mine and hers was even too long. Because of the casing around the barrel you can only curl 10-12 inches of hair. For me at least this means I can only curl the very bottom of my hair....which looks ridiculous. I was so excited for this curling iron I drove like an hour away to buy it, so disappointed. Since I didn&#x27;t bother to finish curling can&#x27;t say how long the curl lasts.</li>
    <li> I really love the design of this curling iron. It&#x27;s so easy to use and hair falls right into place when wrapping around the barrel. I just wish Remington would have put more effort into this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature has got to be the non-traditional clamp at the base of the barrel. It does not lift up and clamp hair down as traditional curling irons usually have. Instead this clamp slides downward with your thumb creating a small space where you would place the end of your hair. You would then release your thumb and the clamp slides back up effectively holding your hair in place between the plastic sheath and thumbpiece. Though this design makes it more difficult for your ends to have a tight curl (since it is not clamped down directly onto the barrel as with traditional curling irons), this method of holding the ends of hair in place eliminates the problem I often get with my hair sliding too far underneath the clamps on traditional irons and getting tangled/caught in places where I&#x27;d have to yank hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is awesome because you could place hands over the plastic that twirls around the hot barrel and not get burned. Would be a great first curling iron for a younger child. The plastic sheathing guides hair into the right places and really does create the \\&quot;perfect curl\\&quot;...consistent every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No heat settings. This iron was not hot enough for my hair. Though curls didn&#x27;t straighten out after a day, They certainly did not retain the curliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not work on long hair. Period. Shoulder length or a little past shoulder length is fine. But my almost waist length hair was curled only up to my ears. It was extremely difficult to do the half and half method because the design of iron made clamping of hair mid way rather than at the ends, difficult. If I managed to clamp hair in and wrapped hair around barrel, it would only get close to the scalp but not quite. It&#x27;s hard to explain but as you got closer to your scalp the section of hair naturally widens and makes it increasingly difficult to get in between spaces on barrel. And the other problem is, when releasing hair that is from midsection up to scalp, you&#x27;d actually have to pull iron through entire length of hair to release hair (effectively straigtening out lower portion of hair that you had curled previously). You could of course try to unroll your hair gingerly but I found it just kept tangling my hair up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and last...curls only go in one direction. If you like to have curls turning towards the back of head for example, you could do one side but not the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.

    <li> Very cool curler,forms curls easy,only downfall is I didn&#x27;t know I purchased a used product overall it worked for my thick hair</li>
    <li> Found it difficult to use...was hard to get the hair in the groove which is too bad since I had high hopes for it.  It might be worth a try if you are using on someone else&#x27;s hair though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I had to return mine.</li>
    <li> takes me aprox 10 mins to curl my long hair. i work 12 hour shifts as a nurse in the ER and it stays in place all night! everyone asks what product i use!</li>
    <li> Perfect love it ! It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more from it</li>
    <li> My grand daughters can use this ages 11 without fear of burning themselves and it makes incredible curls that last into the next day and their hair never hold curls ,so I bought another after the first one it worked so well .</li>
    <li> I purchased this Curling Iron after read the reviews, which create a positive expectation about this product.&lt;br /&gt;When i went to test the product, I saw that it does not works properly as advertised. I did watch the videos and other information&#x27;s and my conclusion is that this kind of product is not for my kind of hair. When I went to the website to return, the seller does not allow me to do that cause according their \\&quot;policy\\&quot; it was more than 30 days from the purchasing date. My best knowledge about customer affair relationships indicates that this kind of restriction is under laws. The solution for me is throwing out this Curling Iron cause does not work as well and the seller does not want to take it back. I&#x27;m really disappointed with.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is amazing! My friend bought me one for my birthday, and it is the only thing I use to curl my hair. It makes perfect curls, and it is very easy to use. It only has one heat setting, so you have to leave it on for a while. I have thick coarse hair, and it takes a while to curl, this iron makes it faster and easier. My curls hold for weeks! If you want something good, that you won&#x27;t burn your fingers with, this is perfect for you. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a regular wand, the gloves get in the way, and you can still burn yourself. I have tried curling irons and wands, and this, by far is my favorite! You won&#x27;t regret buying this.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling iron! My hair never takes a curl with a regular curling iron. The curl will stay for about twenty minutes and then fall completely flat again. Because I have very long hair, it would also take me about an hour and a half to curl all of my hair with a regular curling iron. With the curl perfect, my curls were still in tact the next day and it only took me a half hour to curl my entire head of hair! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that has had bad luck with regular curling irons and wants to dramatically cut down the time it takes to get perfectly curled hair. Definitely worth the price too! I have seen this product in stores for $25 to $30 and I bought it on Amazon for $14. This product is a must have!</li>
    <li> I love it! As soon as I got it I had to try it out! It makes curling my hair a breeeeezzzzeee!</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron. It is the best I have ever owned for lasting curls. so easy to use and no burnt fingers! I get complements on my beautiful curls every time I use it. I have long fine hair, but the curls stay in beautifully. I section off my hair in layers and curl each layer starting from the bottom up. Takes a little longer, but the results are worth it, because curls stay in all day and I have nice waves the second day. Also purchased this as a gift for my granddaughters and they love it too!</li>
    <li> my daughter uses this almost daily. I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about her getting burned when doing her hair. the curls come out lovely.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different hair curlers and none of the curls ever last more then 10 minutes so I was very surprised with the results of this curler. The curls from this curler could easily last a day if it doesn&#x27;t get wet without any hairspray to it. It works on long and short hair which is a plus</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like them. They do not perform well.</li>
    <li> i have fine thin hair. I&#x27;ve never been able to hold a curl. Until I found this. Now in 5-10 minutes (depending on how curly I want it) I have beach wavy hair that even stays all night if I use a styling foam/spray on wet hair then use this curling iron. Everyone who has ever used mine...buys one. Easily beats out any $100+ irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It fits perfect with my needs!! Its easy to use an the result is amazing, i really love it! And also its really cheap.</li>
    <li> Curls come out perfect. Smooth and effortless. It also leaves a shine that&#x27;s eye catching to the people I&#x27;ve used it on. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have slightly wavy long hair, but i usually flat iron every week with another remington product.  i decided i wanted to have some curls occasionally, so i began looking for curling irons.  Several other well known brands either burnt the hair, creased the curls or created unevenly distributed curls. I came across Remington&#x27;s Curl Perfect on Amazon and i though i&#x27;d give it a try. This was a decision that I have certainly not regretted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron gives you really nice, bouncy evenly distributed curls without out the harsh crease lines.  The curls are smooth and looks natural.  The curl guide barrel makes it simple to curl your hair easily unlike other traditional curling irons. I never had to &amp;#34;re-do&amp;#34; a curl. It was perfect on each try. I&#x27;ve read the other reviews which have said that it can only work with shoulder lenght hair because of the lenght of the barrel.  I beg to disagree because the barrel doesn&#x27;t go all the way up to the root or scalp, but the curls still falls naturally so that the curls doesnt look to tight or false. my hair lenght is almost to the middle of my back. It gives the user a really soft look, which is what i definitely was aiming to acheive. I was really impressed with the guides which are made with some sort of material that doesnt get hot and as such there wasnt any burning of fingers or ears or even the carpet where i was styling my hair.  I didn&#x27;t use any products (gels, sprays etc), slept on it and it was still really curly the next morning. If i have a function to attend, then I will try using a light hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- light weight.&lt;br /&gt;- heats up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;- even distribution and smooth curls.&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t leave marring marks.&lt;br /&gt;- dont need products such as hair spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- The iron doesn&#x27;t come in a larger barrel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is Curl Perfect. Great Job Remington !!</li>
    <li> every body with the medium hair length can use without damaging their hairs. its so perfect and quick to use my 11 year old love so much</li>
    <li> I love this curler because I never get burned and it makes perfect curls. I do not recommend this product to anyone with shoulder length hair or any less than that. I love it because the clap holds perfectly and is easy to handle. It only curls one way though so it looks \\&quot;off\\&quot; sometimes and I have to fix it with my hair straightner. But I do recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I want to LOVE this curling iron. It makes excellent curls, it is not hot to the touch, but the barrel definitely heats up to do the job.  I have very straight, fine hair and this curls it great and the curls hold all day.  HOWEVER, it seems to make all the curls go in the same directions... meaning every single curl on the right side of my head curls back (away from my face) and every single curl on the left side of my head curls in towards my face.  It&#x27;s crazy!  I have tried using is backward, upside down, from the root to the end... I just cannot figure out.  My curls look awesome except for the fact that I curl from the right side of my face all the way to the left side of my face all in one direction.  Yikes!  Not a good look!  I&#x27;m not sure if this is operator error, but I cannot make it work differently.</li>
    <li> i bought for my girlfriend and she is soooo happy! it really easy to use, in fact i do the work for her several times a week! i recommend it</li>
    <li> I was excited about this curler; but my curls fell out in an hour. Did anyone else have this problem?</li>
    <li> Personally, I wasnt crazy about this curler, and it could just be because I am not used to curling my hair and do not have the technique. Even though this is supposed to be &amp;#34;fool proof&amp;#34; because of the design, it wasnt for me. First of all, the opening that you&#x27;re supposed to slide your hair into is way to small- they should make it wider! Second, my hair kept slipping out and it is kind of cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I did read good comments about it, which is why I bought it at first, but this just wasnt for me!</li>
    <li> very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations so well that I was really very happy thank you</li>
    <li> I am simply not smart enough to use this curling iron.  I took it to Goodwill where somebody way more hip than I am will get a real bargain!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my college age daughter who loves it. She tried it when visiting a friend and had to have it. We were unable to find it at local stores so ordered it from Amazon. My daughter has long thick hair and loves how this curls.</li>
    <li> This iron makes nice curls but I find it difficult to use on my own hair. Would need 3 hands to hold and twirl in the correct direction. Easy to use on someone else.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be great for my daughter. she&#x27;s six and likes to move a lot.. so I though it would be safer. The first curl was magnificent. .. everything i hoped it would be. Then as I went on they were not that great.</li>
    <li> well, properly Iam not happy with the product, but My girlfriend loves this iron, now it takes more time to get ready!!</li>
    <li> I guess if you have someone do your hair for you this would work but try by yourself and good luck. This item sucks</li>
    <li> Recomended! Fast and objective! I aproove and I will recomend for all my friends! Thanks for all, amd ill buy much more!</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected.  It does not work for me. I have used curling irons for years and am a former hair dresser. This is simply a bad design.</li>
    <li> Not for thick long hair, works well on thin hair.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to anyone who want alot of curls in their hair, this was a great buy and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I ordered 3/4 inch one, and received 1 1/4 inch one, to this day, I haven&#x27;t received my replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;@ I have perfectly silky Asian straight hair, the curls come out perfect, but they only last about an hour or two&lt;br /&gt;@temperature is too low, I have fairly thin hair, still, it takes me more than 25 mins to curl the entire hair,&lt;br /&gt;@ you can only curl in one direction, it&#x27;s hard to create beach weavy type of curls.</li>
    <li> So there are a few things that make this iron great, and a few things SOME people may dislike but I have gotten around it so that it is my favorite iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;1. I have very fine hair on the thick side, and this one curls my hair and holds ALL day with very little hairspray. With some others I have to spray it to death.&lt;br /&gt;2. There is no place that gets too hot and burns you on the iron because of the protective plastic on the outside that acts as a guide... unless you touch the very tip. I hold it lightly near the tip but not actually on it.&lt;br /&gt;3. It only takes me 1/2 hour to do my hair, versus others have taken me an hour.&lt;br /&gt;4. At some drug/makeup stores, you can get it for pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;5. It trained me how to use a curling iron well, I hate the ones with the clamp now because those just don&#x27;t work on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eh to some:&lt;br /&gt;1. The wand can only curl about half of your hair if it is medium length and even less if longer. I happen to like this look because I don&#x27;t like my hair to be curled at the root. The transition from straight to curly is done well.&lt;br /&gt;2. The curls look very perfect and will always curl in the same direction around your entire head. I don&#x27;t mind this because I break the curls apart to make it look more natural, and the direction of the curl is less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;3. The clamp just does not work for me... I end up not using the clamp. The first time I used it I used the clamp and all it did was get my hair caught. Overall the worst part of the design. It works fine without the dumb clamp.&lt;br /&gt;4. The very ends are a little tricky. I hold the tip of my ends at the end of the slot for maximum curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general when curling I take small sections (for tighter curls, slightly thicker for wider curls) and I put the section into a slot in the middle of the iron. Then I wrap and adjust the curl until the ends of my hair are at the end of the &amp;#34;slot&amp;#34; in the end of the iron. It may take some rotation of the iron to do this, and then continue to wrap the rest of the hair upward (iron facing down). I hold for about 20 seconds or more (it&#x27;s not the hottest iron, not a bad thing) and then gently pull the iron down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great iron. There are a few tricks to it, but if you use it a few times you will get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> This truly does give you a perfect curl.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t cause you to burn your fingers like the last iron.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is easy to use. Your curls will be perfect every time. It heats up quickly. Tip: try using a heat defense product to keep hair shiny</li>
    <li> Does not work!  Waste of my money!!</li>
    <li> We got this for our 9 yr olds birthday and she loves it.  The only issue I have is that it only curls in one direction.  I know there is not really anything that can be done about it but if you are considering purchasing one...it&#x27;s something to consider.  She really doesn&#x27;t care, she&#x27;s just excited to be able to curl her own hair and the plastic rolling guide on the outside of the rod assures us that she won&#x27;t burn herself.  The curling rod itself gets plenty hot to produce a great curl.</li>
    <li> This product only seems good to use on shorter hair.  Maybe I was using it wrong, or I thought my hair was shorter than it really is, but...if I can&#x27;t use the product for any length of hair, I&#x27;ll have to be more careful in the future I guess.</li>
    <li> It is so difficult to get the hair in the iron, and it mostly goes the wrong way, when rolling it up.  If I do get it rolled on one side, then doing it on the other side doesn&#x27;t work.  I am going to try it again next week, but basically, it is so frustrating that I gave up.</li>
    <li> Love this curler!  I have really thick corse hair that never holds a curl. This tool not only gave me perfect curls, they also lasted all day long! Totally recommend this styler.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, thank you.she told me it was way better than her old curling iron, and that it works great.</li>
    <li> excellent looks very beautiful my girl with her ​​curls</li>
    <li> the product is perfect for people who have a hard time curling. it makes curling so much easier and faster. i just wish you could curl in more than one direction.</li>
    <li> not what i expected, hard to use.</li>
    <li> The search for the Right Item just ended after having this Unique Item.Excellent Product &amp; Very Fast Shipping with High Quality Export Packaging. Many Thanks. Strongly recommended to have and experience.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this curling iron.  It&#x27;s like a curling iron for dummies.  Right out of the box, I was able to to curl my entire head in less than 30 minutes.  Perfect spiral curls, exactly like I wanted them.  After paying professionals several times for &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; hair, I was quite impressed with myself and excited to be able to do my own hair for an upcoming wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a Remington flat iron that works better than any flat iron I&#x27;ve used.  I took a chance on this curling iron because of my experience with Remington, and I was not disappointed at all.</li>
    <li> u can curle your hair very easuly.  it looks like make in beauty salon. i suggestfor both  long and short hair womans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i hope u use it easily</li>
    <li> Thank you for your great service and fast delivery! I absolutly love this curling iron! It&#x27;s so easy and makes perfect curls. The only con I would have is that I have very long hair and it only allows you so much hair at a time. So, if you have the time it&#x27;s perfect. I would definitely suggest this for shorter hair!</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron.. I have long hair and even though it doesnt curl all the way to the scalp (i curl as far up as it goes and only hold it there for a few seconds, makes amazing loose wavy curls) .. The curls from this curling iron are super long lasting without hairspray.. :)</li>
    <li> This curling iron is a terrific bargain. It&#x27;s easy to use and protects you from burns. For my medium long hair it works great! It takes a little practice, but once you get it, it&#x27;s easy. Heats up super fast. The only downside to me is that it doesn&#x27;t hold enough hair at one time. If they made a model that did that I would buy it too.</li>
    <li> Is just what I expected as seen in videos, cute curly leaves in my hair. I will recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> I love the idea of curling my hair; sadly, I am not a skilled hair stylist.  I have purchased quite a few curlers and have had very little luck using them, instead of the beautiful curls I dream of, I end up looking like a real mess! Not good.  I saw this product here on Amazon and thought why not try it.  Let me tell you, it is truly awesome.  It is easy to use, and provides me with beautiful even curls.  This item takes very little skill to use, perfect for me! You simply take a portion of hair, wrap it around the barrel and curl away.  The design of this product is quite ingenious.  The plastic attachment on the barrel guides your hair into a perfect position for beautiful curls.  I use it all the time and it is quick and easy.  Worth a shot for anyone who is looking for fool proof curls.  The shipping was great, I love Prime</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter that has long curly hair....it gave her smooth beautiful curls!  Love this curling iron!</li>
    <li> easy to use, long lasting curls, does not burn the hair if occasionally use. Is perfect for a change look.</li>
    <li> This product Is great for beginners its so easy to use. I had no idea to even use a curling iron until I came across this its simple and anyone could use it, even my 10 yr old cousin used it and found it quite easy to use. Its worth the pay I reccomend to anyone who has trouble styling their hair or don&#x27;t understand how to use a curing iron!</li>
    <li> just in time for my wedding, love the product, best ever!! And I looked amazing on my day! Thank you</li>
    <li> So I bought this a few years back in target for like 15 or 20 bucks.At first it was a  difficult to use but after a while you get the hang of it.Also I noticed that you get prettier curls when you do  small sections and this is why it seems better suitable with fine hair.It is a good product for styling tool beginners as it guides the curl for you</li>
    <li> This curling iron is very  easy to use and if you have  the time to spend,  produces lovely, bouncy curls!</li>
    <li> I could not get my hair to stay in it and don&#x27;t have enough time to play with it right now.</li>
    <li> My wife is a little sad because the press says hair not working as expected 100%, however if it works and if enough time is required if styling makes it the curls</li>
    <li> I wanted something where I would not have to use one hand to wrap my hair around the barrel.  The clip is so small it hold only a tiny piece of hair.  Then as you rotate the barrel the hair lays on top of the plastic spiral cover more than it goes down into the grooves.  It knotted my hair, didn&#x27;t curl it, and was a frustrating experience.  I returned it and got a Helen of Troy 1/2 barrel regular curling iron.  By clipping just the very end of my long hair I get great spiral curls.  It cost around $40 at Salley beauty supply and they take returns.</li>
    <li> Came super fast... love it but wish it would get just a tad hotter but it works great.... still learning how to maneuver it lol</li>
    <li> Hard to use, difficult, not anything I want</li>
    <li> I love, love, love my curls!!!!  There is a learning curve and curls only go one way but still overall great curler!</li>
    <li> Perfect spiral curls every single time!!! It works so well on any hair types, and my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl well. I can wake up the next morning with the same curls I put into it the day before.</li>
    <li> I love the curling iron. I have very thick, medium long hair and it works incredibly well. Curls stay in and last for days slowly ending in beach waves. BUT, the packaging was super shady. No original box. Just a plastic bag with a half torn off sticker on it with the website to download directions. Lack of original packaging was not stated in the description. I want to buy one for a gift, but can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m really put off by the deception - if it&#x27;s not in original box, just say so. But the product itself is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I got it today and it works great, I don&#x27;t know why it didn&#x27;t come in its original boxing or with its instructions because I brought it &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;. But the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that I wish the barrel with a bit longer because I have longer hair and I wish you would go all the way to the roots of my hair to make the full strain of hair curly. But other then that I love it and its easy once you get the hang of it and it definitely does the job!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this curling iron.  I get perfect curls every time that last for days!  It never gets hot to the touch, so even my 10 year old can curl her own hair.  Its the best iron out there!</li>
    <li> I have at least 2ft of hair, and I never learned to curl before it got this long, and to say the least this is amazing and so easy to use, i&#x27;m definitely going to order the bigger barrel one next to add to my collection.</li>
    <li> Quick review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro - It makes the perfect curl everytime!&lt;br /&gt;Con - The curls can only go the one way so they eventually all combine as one.</li>
    <li> Loved it! The only bad thing was that I have long hair and the curler isn&#x27;t long enough to curl my hair up to the root. Aside from this note it works great.  Makes curling your hair a lot easier.</li>
    <li> I have used almost every different kind of curling iron out there so I was skeptical when I saw this strange looking iron. I read a few reviews on another beauty site that were excellent and reluctantly tried it. If it didn&#x27;t work I was planning on taking it right back. To my suprise this iron worked better than any iron I have EVER used! The curls are springy at first but if you shake your curls out and even lightly brush them they turn into the most beautiful curls I have ever had, not to mention they last all day! I don&#x27;t know what is so different about this iron but I have never had curls that last all day and look so beautiful. I don&#x27;t even use any product in my hair to hold the curls... it is truly amazing.  I even bought a back up wand just in case anything ever happens to this wand. I don&#x27;t ever want to be with out it again!  I have received more compliments than I have ever received since using this product. I highly highly reccomend.  Also I watched a few you tube videos for technique that really helped</li>
    <li> This item is perfect for those who are a little &amp;#34;styling challenged&amp;#34; when it comes to the traditional barrel.&lt;br /&gt;Short learn curve and you can have a head full of beautiful curls within minutes.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it produces cute, bouncy curls every time - even on my hard to curl hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Worked Great !! *****</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me. I found it awkward to use. The spring clip doesn&#x27;t really hold fine hair well, and it&#x27;s hard to get strands through the plastic spiral.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in the store rather than online because I didn&#x27;t want to mess with shipping. I was a little hesitant because of the design and honestly, I was expecting to return it because my hair usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl and when it does, it looks awful. However, when I tried this product my hair looked GREAT. The spirals make it easy to form the perfect curls and it&#x27;s just the right length of barrel for my hair (a little past my shoulder). My hair actually kept the curls (with a little help from some hairspray).&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I can&#x27;t complain much about this product since I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far. I would say it&#x27;s frustrating that there isn&#x27;t any heat settings because it does get really hot and it&#x27;s probably not the greatest for my hair. BUT, it does the job and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments with my curls. Overall, I&#x27;d say it was worth my $20!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing curling iron.  It is easy to use, and it creates ringlet curls that last all day!  It will not burn your hair either.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I wanted an iron that I could use quickly in the mornings and this one works quite well for me.  I have a little longer than shoulder length hair that tends to curl/wave on it&#x27;s own.  I don&#x27;t have to get a curling iron very hot to curl my hair as that is it&#x27;s natural inclination anyway; in fact, I can&#x27;t leave my hair on this iron long at all or it becomes a bit -too- curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging for this item was easy to open.  None of that horrible sealed plastic packaging here, which was a relief.  I always feel like I&#x27;m going to cut off a finger when opening packaging, so I love it when I don&#x27;t have to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron has a button that works to turn it on and off; I fully expect that the end of life for this iron will either be when the heating element dies or when that button stops working.  Still, it&#x27;s easy enough to use.  There are no heat setting dials, but if you have hair that tends to curl, that won&#x27;t be a problem.  If you have hair that is straight and absolutely hates to take a curl, try putting a curling gel in your hair before you blow dry, then use the iron. Otherwise, this might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting hair into the clip is difficult till you get the hang of it.  I was worried that the ends of my hair wouldn&#x27;t be curled and would be frizzy, but once you start winding your hair into the channel, the end gets tugged tight against the ceramic barrel and curls, too.  It&#x27;s simple to do any hair that you can -see-, but once you get to the back of your head it becomes more difficult.  I had trouble getting my hair into the clip.  However, even when using a regular iron, it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to tell when I&#x27;ve done things properly at the back of my head ... so, I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just me or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first real use of the iron to get ready for work too only about 10 minutes, and left really pretty, shiny curls behind.  I still need to get the timing right as my hair -likes- to curl and sometimes takes a bit too well to heat curling, but otherwise, this is a very nice iron that works well at what it does.  It just takes a little getting used to at first.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time as advertised</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get the hair around the iron the way it was easily shown on tv I have thick hair and the product is difficult to use</li>
    <li> I have this really stright hair... and to have curls for more tan 10 minutes it´s quite a work... and surpriese with the curl perfect I have curls for almost all day, and they look beautifull and natural</li>
    <li> This was a gift and did not come in a box. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron ever</li>
    <li> This curling iron is a quick and easy to use tool. It is made for dummy proof curling. For someone like myself who has never used curling irons or many styling tools, this curling iron worked perfectly for me. I was able to achieve the perfect curl without any trouble or without it taking me an hour to curl my entire head. In less than 30 minutes you can have your hair styled and ready. My curls last all day, with no heavy product to keep them in. I just curl, spray with a flexible hold hairspray, and go. Perfect tool for a young lady just learning to style her hair, or for those of us who need something for a quick style.</li>
    <li> I have searched and searched for a hair curler that would work on my stick straight hair, and finally I am happy to say I have found one!!! Perfect curls each time, and it actually holds...that never happens with my hair!It also took about half the amount of time a regular curler would take! I&#x27;m sooooo happy, the only downside is that I have long hair so I wasn&#x27;t able to curl straight to my scalp, but I don&#x27;t really care because the end result was just so great I didn&#x27;t even need to curl all the way to my scalp!It was Definitely worth the money(which was super cheap by the way)!!!</li>
    <li> Only issue I have with this is that I wish the barrell would hold more hair, overall its a good product</li>
    <li> This product gave my hair the most gorgeous curls ever! and it lasts all day long!! Thank you Remington Solutions!</li>
    <li> Love it.. bought this for my 1 year old and I love it... yes my baby has tons of hair to where I can curl it! Follow me on instagram @mizjaquez</li>
    <li> When I saw this on Amazon, I got excited because I was looking for something to give me loose, spiral curls.  BUT after one use, I sent it back.  It was very difficult to use - tangled my hair.  As a working woman with limited time to spend on my very long hair in the mornings, I would definitely NOT recommend this product!</li>
