      <li>/&gt;It absorbs fairly well</li>
      <li>Superior product.</li>
      <li>I must say that the cream has done a good job on my cuticles.  </li>
      <li>It smells good and the 3.5 oz is a good size.  </li>
      <li>Since the tube says that the cream is good for hands, I started to use it on my hands, nails and cuticles.</li>
      <li>She had mentioned to me that she sure would love to have this product since it is the best hand and cuticle cream she has ever used.  </li>
      <li>love this hand cream!</li>
      <li>Instead some kind of cuticle remover, NOT what I ordered.</li>
      <li>Nice orange fragrance, too.</li>
      <li>BEST PRODUCT FOR REAL.</li>
      <li>Has a nice smell without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>- I hope so,  The fragrance is nice - citrus.</li>
      <li>Neither is the hand cream effective nor is the foot cream effective.</li>
      <li>Pleasant scent, not too strong.</li>
      <li>Very happy with the product came a day early and smells like oranges</li>
      <li>cream was the best I found and fit in my scrub jacket&#x27;s large pockets although the tube is not that small.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is a great proudct, works great and last too.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I was really impressed with the foot cream by sally hansen in the white tube.</li>
      <li>This has been my daughter&#x27;s favorite hand cream for years.</li>
      <li>it became even more flaky and my skin was peeling off.</li>
      <li>We have not been able to find it at any store, either in Virginia, my home or Texas, her home.  </li>
      <li>I love the citrus scent too.</li>
      <li>This product soothes both problems and my fingers are band aid free!  </li>
      <li>so I put more of the lotion on, thinking it would make it better.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of the hand cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many creams, balms &amp; oils on my dry cuticles and this lotion is the best.</li>
      <li>This is the best product for dry winter hands.  </li>
      <li>Now, her hands finally feel nice and smooth again and her cuticles look great.  </li>
      <li>This used to be a great cream; however I think I received an old batch.</li>
      <li>And it smells sweet and citrusy!</li>
      <li>I thoroughly enjoy this and am glad its available on amazon.</li>
      <li>It absorbs easily, without leaving any sticky residue.</li>
      <li>Anyway it is an extremely strong smell</li>
      <li>It was fine for a while</li>
      <li>This is a great hand cream, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>As of December 3, I have yet to receive the right product (which, by the way, I LOVE, give it 5 stars).</li>
      <li>Between manicures I&#x27;ve taken to using this creme, and it is rich, moisturizing and smells like oranges.</li>
      <li>Great for dry skin during the winter!</li>
      <li>She was thrilled and surprised to receive it.  </li>
      <li>As a not unpleasant of \\&quot;Tang\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Creme sinks in the skin quickly, and it smells good too.</li>
      <li>I only purchased this lotion because I needed roughly $5 more for free shipping.</li>
      <li>Applying this directly to my cuticles makes them look amazingly nice, better than the nail salon, after only a couple applications.</li>
      <li>but my last tube has an off-smell to it (not horrible but not the way it should smell).</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>at first</li>
      <li>It leaves my hands feeling smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>It is the best hand cream ever and a small amount is enough for both hands!!!</li>
      <li>I just work it into any rough spots and the creme leaves the skin nice and supple.</li>
      <li>My hands are nice and soft and my nails are thick and strong!</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it used to have the most delicious orange scent, but the last bottle I received didn&#x27;t smell much at all.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hands super soft without being greasy!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hand cream for the dry winter months.  </li>
      <li>Very nice, delicate smell!</li>
      <li>I really dont like the smell.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I worked as a nurse inpatient for 10 years and, like most &amp;#34;floor&amp;#34; nurses, had chronically chapped hands and rough cuticles from all the handwashing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>which is what I really wanted from this product.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>People frequently compliment my natural nails and it is all thanks to this creme!</li>
      <li>Broke a few more last week but once again probably more due to my job entailing a lot of handwashing.  </li>
      <li>My hands weren&#x27;t badly dried or anything, but they could have used some extra loving.</li>
      <li>Really picky with hand lotions, would definitely recommend this one.</li>
      <li>I like that is does not wash off in water and my hands still feel soft.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hands soft.</li>
      <li>It leaves hands and cuticles soft.</li>
      <li>The ironic thing is I broke 3 nails in the last 2 days.  </li>
      <li>A small amount will cover both hands and make them feel moisturized unlike cheap watery feeling lotion.  </li>
      <li>After a day, it was back to normal.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hands soft, however, it is not a miracle product that prevents hangnails, hangnails I can only get rid of professionally.</li>
      <li>the first time for me to try and feel it&#x27;s moisture, waiting for futher try other product of Sally Hansen.</li>
      <li>I like to use this directly on my bare nails and cuticles before doing my nails.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice, delicate smell! Indeed, it softened my hand skin and helped my flaky cuticles heal. It absorbs easily, without leaving any sticky residue.</li>
    <li> It is the best hand cream ever and a small amount is enough for both hands!!! Great product and great price!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Sally Hansen Product, because in Austria we do not have this products and this hand balm is THE BEST I ever had!!  Great to buy it via amazon.com!!!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the service I received when I ordered my Sally Hansen Hand Repair Hand Nail &amp; Cuticle Cream.  The product is very good and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> love this hand cream!</li>
    <li> I have the bad habit of picking my cuticles, which looks awful as well. Applying this directly to my cuticles makes them look amazingly nice, better than the nail salon, after only a couple applications. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This has been my daughter&#x27;s favorite hand cream for years. We have not been able to find it at any store, either in Virginia, my home or Texas, her home.  She had mentioned to me that she sure would love to have this product since it is the best hand and cuticle cream she has ever used.  Well, I went online   and found it at Amazon and sent her a gift of three tubes.  She was thrilled and surprised to receive it.  Now, her hands finally feel nice and smooth again and her cuticles look great.  This is a great product.  When she runs out, I will know where to find it again.</li>
    <li> After reading favorable reviews from users of different nail products, I decided to order two tubes of this product for my cuticles.  I must say that the cream has done a good job on my cuticles.  Since the tube says that the cream is good for hands, I started to use it on my hands, nails and cuticles. My wedding rings are wide and cover my ring finger almost to the knuckle.  Within a week, the area under my rings became swollen and red; the skin is actually burned, showing the impressions of my rings. Some ingredient in this cream reacted badly with my rings which are 14K yellow gold. Never has anything like this happened to me from a hand cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous.  It actually makes my nails harder!  Creme sinks in the skin quickly, and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Just one little dab a day is all you need to keep hangnails away. I wish they still made it.</li>
    <li> I lived in the Southwest for a while and every winter my hands would get so dry that my cuticles would crack and bleed. I tried everything and found Sally Hansen to be the only thing that helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About twice a day I would apply as directed, and my cuticles stayed nice all year!</li>
    <li> Very pleasant scent. Superior product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now and I can truly see a difference. My hands are nice and soft and my nails are thick and strong! And it smells sweet and citrusy!</li>
    <li> This is a great proudct, works great and last too.  I buy it over and over again. I buy other products from Sally Hansen</li>
    <li> Like this a lot. Have very dry skin. I use it on my elbows, feet, and hands!</li>
    <li> the first time for me to try and feel it&#x27;s moisture, waiting for futher try other product of Sally Hansen.</li>
    <li> Makes my hands super soft without being greasy! Also helped with the hangnails I was regularly getting. Really picky with hand lotions, would definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> This hand cream comes in a squeezable container (tube). It&#x27;s quite rich and creamy - somewhat thick. I use it at night before I go to bed - as it is just a wee bit greasy.  I don&#x27;t want that on my hands during the day.  Too soon to tell if it is improving my nails and hands - I hope so,  The fragrance is nice - citrus.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for dry winter hands.  Non greasy and smells great!  Lasts till nest hand washing. Love it</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve used.  Not sticky, but nice and&lt;br /&gt;thick and has a wonderful orange scent</li>
    <li> I CAN&#x27;T SAY THAT I KNOW IF THIS PRODUCT WORKS BECAUSE I USED IT ONCE AND WASHED IT OFF IMMEDIATELY.  THE SMELL IS SO BAD THAT I JUST COULDN&#x27;T TAKE IT.</li>
    <li> This stuff is thick enough without being greasy at all! And it smells wonderful! Great for dry skin during the winter!</li>
    <li> I had bought this product before and I was very happy about it however my last purchase was a shame! it smelled strange and then I found out that there were beetles inside of the cap of the product!!!!!!! the most disgusting scene that you can imagine!!! you want to apply cream on your hand and you&#x27;ll also get some insect on it!!!!!! Probably the seller had stored this product for a long time in a place they store grains or some food!</li>
    <li> I like to use this directly on my bare nails and cuticles before doing my nails. Makes them feel soft and less brittle. I wouldn&#x27;t say it removes the cuticles, but I feel I&#x27;m adding nail polish to nails that now have moisture in them.  As a not unpleasant of \\&quot;Tang\\&quot;.  Would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Seller was prompt item feels great on hands, and around your cuticles..</li>
    <li> This is a great hand cream. Not greasy. Leaves my hands soft. Has a nice smell without being overpowering. Would order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a week.  I really dont like the smell.  It&#x27;s suppose to be grape seed and I guess that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m smelling.  Anyway it is an extremely strong smell and that&#x27;s all I can smell if my hands are anywhere close to my face and I have a very dull nose.  It seems about the same as any other hand lotion.  A small amount will cover both hands and make them feel moisturized unlike cheap watery feeling lotion.  The ironic thing is I broke 3 nails in the last 2 days.  Now this may just be a coincidence since I often break my long nails so I&#x27;m not using it as part of my rating.  Will try to update my review after I use it longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6-22-12:&lt;br /&gt;Upped the rating to 4 stars.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell so it&#x27;s no longer overpowering.  Still guarded about the broken nails.  Broke a few more last week but once again probably more due to my job entailing a lot of handwashing.  Leave a comment if you know a very good hand lotion to prevent brittle nails.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand cream for the dry winter months.  My only complaint is that it used to have the most delicious orange scent, but the last bottle I received didn&#x27;t smell much at all.  Still a great lotion though!</li>
    <li> Smells like Orange tic tacs, and feels so good! Not too greasy. Very nice. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This used to be a great cream; however I think I received an old batch. It was fine for a while but my last tube has an off-smell to it (not horrible but not the way it should smell). I am afraid this product has sat in someone&#x27;s warehouse for a few years since they don&#x27;t make this packaging anymore. I am going to find a newer version of this hand cream (it&#x27;s hard to find in stores).</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was really impressed with the foot cream by sally hansen in the white tube. However, this series in the orange tube is not moisturising. Neither is the hand cream effective nor is the foot cream effective. BAD!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! Ive always been amazed everytime I use it. I have rough hands and this creme has been like a massage creme that add silky softness to the equation. I thoroughly enjoy this and am glad its available on amazon.</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent, not too strong. I leave it on my desk to periodically rub lotion into my short nails. It hasn&#x27;t made them grow, but then again nothing has over the years. It does make my cuticles look nicer though, which is what I really wanted from this product.</li>
    <li> I have a terrible time with dry, scaly skin patches on my hands.  And have to mention the biting and ripping of bad cuticles so that I have to wear bandages around my nails to get them to heal.  This product soothes both problems and my fingers are band aid free!  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many creams, balms &amp; oils on my dry cuticles and this lotion is the best. Not greasy and makes my skin glow. Nice orange fragrance, too.</li>
    <li> Between manicures I&#x27;ve taken to using this creme, and it is rich, moisturizing and smells like oranges. It keeps my hands soft, however, it is not a miracle product that prevents hangnails, hangnails I can only get rid of professionally. Preventing them is what I&#x27;m looking for in a nail &amp; cuticle creme, and have yet to find that quality. It&#x27;s size is not overabundant so it will not go off before finishing it.</li>
    <li> I received the WRONG product, not what&#x27;s listed above.  Instead some kind of cuticle remover, NOT what I ordered. I sent it back on November 9, 2012. As of December 3, I have yet to receive the right product (which, by the way, I LOVE, give it 5 stars).</li>
    <li> This is a great hand cream, especially for the price. It leaves hands and cuticles soft. It smells good and the 3.5 oz is a good size.  I live in Utah and our dry, cold winters can be brutal on the skin. I&#x27;ve tried Philosophy, Clinque, L&#x27;Occitane, Jergens (the worst) and Vaseline. The Sally Hansen Radiant Hand Creme was the best price and the best product.</li>
    <li> I worked as a nurse inpatient for 10 years and, like most &amp;#34;floor&amp;#34; nurses, had chronically chapped hands and rough cuticles from all the handwashing.&lt;br /&gt;This cream was the best I found and fit in my scrub jacket&#x27;s large pockets although the tube is not that small.&lt;br /&gt;I find it works best if one massages it around the cuticles themselves as well as the hands while applying it since it softens them both.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs fairly well but I usually wipe my hand on a towel after its application as I have a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; about having lotion on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;The cream also has a pleasant orange scent.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the hand cream. It leaves my hands feeling smooth and soft. I like that is does not wash off in water and my hands still feel soft.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this hand creme years ago and have been using it ever since. It has been especially helpful with my &amp;#34;maturing&amp;#34; skin (READ: dry!). I use it on my hands, feet, knees . . . anything that needs some serious moisture. I just work it into any rough spots and the creme leaves the skin nice and supple. I love the citrus scent too. People frequently compliment my natural nails and it is all thanks to this creme!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product came a day early and smells like oranges soo good lol</li>
    <li> This was probably the worst hand lotion experience ever... My hands weren&#x27;t badly dried or anything, but they could have used some extra loving. I only purchased this lotion because I needed roughly $5 more for free shipping. When I received this Sally Hansen lotion, I put it on at night before I went to sleep and when I woke up the next morning... MY HANDS WERE FLAKING AND GROSS. The palm side of my fingers were peeling and it&#x27;s looked disgusting. I didn&#x27;t know it was the hand lotion at first so I put more of the lotion on, thinking it would make it better. I was wrong... it became even more flaky and my skin was peeling off. My skin isn&#x27;t very sensitive so this was very alarming for me. After the second day of using it, I decided to revert back to my other hand creme. After a day, it was back to normal. Definitely not worth buying this!!</li>
