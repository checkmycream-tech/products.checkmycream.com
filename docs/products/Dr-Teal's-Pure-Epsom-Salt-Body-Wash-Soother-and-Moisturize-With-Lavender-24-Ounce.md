    <li> This is a wonderful body wash.  I love the scent and it foams up great.  It makes my skin feel sooooo smooth.</li>
    <li> The scent is very very mild. I like my Lavender and other natural oil smells to be almost overpowering and this one is only noticeable in its &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; phase. Once you are out of the bath/shower you cannot smell it at all so its effects are non existent.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this. Makes him feel nice and clean. He said it relaxes him.</li>
    <li> I love the scents. It relaxed me, but it dose not moisturize the skin.  It made my skin very dry.</li>
    <li> I was highly disappointed in this body wash. The fragrance was a little disappointing. I&#x27;m sure someone loves it but I am not a great fan.</li>
    <li> VERY RELAXING, I LOVE TO TAKE MY BATH IN THIS! SCENT IS JUST RIGHT NOT OVERPOWERING, AND I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I like a lot of Dr. Teal&#x27;s products and the scent in this Body Wash is amazing. The Lavender is perfect to put you in a relaxed state for bed time. It definitely washes away the stress and worries of the day. Lathers up really well but it&#x27;s probably because of the SLS ingredient which I wished they didn&#x27;t use. I&#x27;m also not sure when they say &amp;#34;Finished product not tested on animals&amp;#34; - does this mean they test all the preliminary products on animals. Tricky wording.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use Dr Teal&#x27;s lavender body wash. It smells wonderful and definitely makes you feel relaxed and refreshed. Great to use right before bed!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used &amp;#34;Mr. Teals&amp;#34;.  Love the fragance and  suds.  I also use as a bubble bath.  Makes quite a few bubbles. Will continue to use and buy from Amazon</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way it relaxes your mind and body. Lavender is a calming scent , Dr.Teal&#x27;s does not disappoint or skimp on the fragrance  every time i use it i can smell the scent hours after!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wear a lot of perfumy things as I have allergies, but lavender I love and use products with a pure lavender scent. This is a great shower gel. Will buy again.</li>

    <li> This smells great, and lathers a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I feel so feminine when I use it in the shower,&lt;br /&gt;and it smells good after the shower too !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> What a fabulous product,  I actually put in the bath tub like a bubble bath and just&lt;br /&gt;relaxed.  Sleep was not far behind my bath.
