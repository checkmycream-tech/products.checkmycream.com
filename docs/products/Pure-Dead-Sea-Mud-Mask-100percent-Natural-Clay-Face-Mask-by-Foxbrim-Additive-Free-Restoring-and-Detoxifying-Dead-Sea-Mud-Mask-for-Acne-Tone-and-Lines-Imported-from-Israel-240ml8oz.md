<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask by Foxbrim is 100% Natural &amp; Additive Free.&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim’s Dead Sea Mud Mask includes only the ancient healing minerals of the Dead Sea. With renown spanning centuries, many have flocked to the Dead Sea to enjoy the amazing skin purifying properties from the silt and mud of the water. Unmatched in it’s composition, Dead Sea Mud is rich in magnesium, calcium, potassium and iron. All essential to maintaining healthy, supple skin. It has also been shown to kill acne-causing bacteria and effectively treat and heal psoriasis. A perfect in-home treatment, this Dead Sea Mud Mask brings you the sacred mud of the Mediterranean to enjoy youthful, radiant and silky skin. I enjoy using this Dead Sea Mud Mask about once a week. I received this complimentary for testing’reviewing purposes, but I only recommend products I personally use and believe are good.</li>
    <li> I love face masks. I used this product last night and it left my skin feeling smooth and soft. Will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> Dead Sea Mud Masks are beneficial to beauty and skin care aficionados because the main ingredient (dead sea mud) contains high concentrations of salts and minerals. Studies state that it is rich in sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium and have a lot of health benefits and healing properties. It can be beneficial to people suffering from psoriasis, eczema and acne. The rich minerals found in this product also accelerates natural exfoliation that restores the skin&#x27;s ph balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and suffer from breakouts and I love using this mask once a week for exfoliating purposes. I started using it regularly and noticed that the appearance of my skin has improved. After using it, my skin always looks clearer and brighter and my pores not as noticeable. I always feel so refreshed after using it! Foxbrim&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask is one of the brands that I have been loving lately because it&#x27;s well priced and made from superior materials. Ergo, I get the most bang for my buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Before I tell you about the product I would like to tell you that my skin is quite dry and I have problems with blotchiness, and was looking for a product that made my skin better in any way.Now, I&#x27;m not one for putting actual mud on my face, but I really wanted to try this. The mud dried within just a few minutes and as I was taking it off I realized that there were little sand particles scrubbing my face, it kind of burned a bit. I was so surprised at the results. Its been 2 days since I used the mask, and my skin is soooo soft, and absolutely no blotching! My skin looks and feels like there are absolutely no flaws! I can not wait to share this with my mom and sisters! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dry or blotchy skin. And honestly, I just find it really cool that this came from the Dead Sea. This product is definitely one of a kind.</li>
    <li> Pros: It&#x27;s great that the ingredients are pure, dead sea mud is known for drawing toxins out of your face. It&#x27;s also mildly abrasive when rubbing in gentle circles so it works as a natural dermabrasion and helps to eliminate blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: I have VERY sensitive skin and was only able to leave it on for half the recommended time as with in 2 mins it was burning and stinging just leaving it on my face prior to scrubbing.</li>
    <li> I truly love this product. I was having breakouts on my chest for some odd reason. So I put it on my face and chest and the breakouts went away. I love the tightness it gives to the skin, very relaxing. I will put it on and take a bath. It is messy for sure, but that is the nature of mud :) I love how you can put it anywhere you want to detox and feel the results. My skin feels very soft afterwards. I feel like the rewards of reducing and fading away unsightly wrinkles and fine lines is exactly what I wanted. The container is huge! Very impressed how big it was. It comes wrapped around a plastic bag, which is very good, mine was leaking a little. Thank you for a great product that works.</li>
    <li> I can really feel the difference when I use this product. It is an amazing mask.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  It works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> This felt amazing. I was a little hesitant at first because it actually looks like really mud but when I used the mask it made my face feel refreshed and great.</li>
    <li> This is the first mud mask that I have tried.  The mud is very smooth and moist and easy to apply.  While it is not fragranced, the scent is pleasant.  I left it on for 10 minutes.  It did wash off easily.  My skin seemed just a tad red after using this.  I did not do as instructed and try it in a small area.  I also put some  on an area behind my neck.  This felt fine, couldn&#x27;t even feel it.  When finished I  applied some moisturizer and felt fine.</li>
    <li> I liked it because from the first use my skin already felt softer. while using the mask I did not feel any discomfort. I recommend this product because it truly works to clean your skin.</li>
    <li> This made my face feel so soft after I was done using it, made it feel all warm and tingling while it hardened. I will be using it more often. My daughter also likes this alot (had to have her try it first). Made our faces feel refreshed and soft taking away whatever was in out pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various types of masks before, but I&#x27;ve never seen a difference. With just one use, I noticed my skin was less oily, more healthy and glowing. Will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the Dead Sea Mud Mask.  I have used mud/facial masks from the store and on a number of occasions I end up with a rash on my face. I was given the Dead Sea Mud Mask in order to provide a review, and I can honestly say I am pleased with the mask.  After i rinsed the mask off my face was soft,  the dead skin and gunk seemed to be gone. It dried my face,  but when accompanied with moisturizer, this mask is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a mud mask before as part of my skin care regime. I have used other &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; but never one like this. I had zero issues with the seal. Mine came nicely packaged with a protective seal around insuring me that it has never been opened before. It has a texture of what you would think mud would have. It&#x27;s cool to the touch and that coolness to the face is nice. Once it dries, easy to remove with water but I also use it along with a face towel. I have used it twice already and love how my skin is looking afterwards. I live in the dry hot desert so it&#x27;s important to manage a healthy skin care routine as well.</li>
    <li> I love pampering myself with an at home spa treatment and I love the benefits of a face mask so I was really excited to get Dead Sea Mud Mask in the mail! I read that other people received their product with leakage but mine was fine. The mask has a light mineral smell which was expected. I followed the clear instructions on the container. I tested it on a small area of skin first and the brushed it all over my face and neck with a synthetic bristle foundation brush like I do with all my masks. I left it on for ten minutes as suggested. I washed it off  and as I washed it off I noticed the gittiness of the mud, which aided in exfoliation. I washed it in the sink but I would suggest rinsing in the shower, as I did have to wash the mud off the sink off after washing my face. After patting dry my skin felt so soft and smooth! I really like the natural ingredients of the mask and the way it made my skin feel! *Discount given for my unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> It is a mud mask. The container does not make any claims for the mud mask doing anything for your skin beyond &amp;#34;youthful, radiant, and silky.&amp;#34; I have done several different masks and I don&#x27;t feel much of a difference after I washed the mask off. I will use it again next week and see if there is more of a change. I will say this, you don&#x27;t use very much to cover your whole face. The instructions say a thin layer and I am always conservative so I spread it out. I would bet you could get a years worth (or close to it) of mud masks out of one container so it is a good value.</li>
    <li> My skin felt so smooth even after the first use!  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> After one use my face felt smoother , tighter and pores are smaller.  The Dead Sea Mud spreads evenly with application and hardens as it dries.  As the mud dry you instantly feel your face tighter.  Washes off faces easily.  Lessons learned, on application be careful not to get too close to the hair line as it ca be difficult to wash from hair.</li>
    <li> Great! I was having break outs and this mask is clearing it up just after a few uses! I love it!</li>
    <li> This mask made my face feel so clean and soft. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. It dried in 10 minutes &amp; came off easily in a warm towel. Afterwards, my black heads were more noticeable as they came to the surface. I used a biore strip and the blackheads came out better than usual. Disclaimer: I received a discount in order to fairly review this product.</li>
    <li> I use this mask once a week. It really opens up my pores and makes my skin feel great. Before I got this I was having huge acne problems and am left with marks all along my jawline. This also helps diminish them. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I like this stuff so far! I&#x27;ve only gotten to use it once, as I haven&#x27;t had it very long, but I do like how it feels on my face. I was a little iffy given that there is not a comprehensive ingredients list, and the directions had a few grammatical errors, but I used it anyway and it seems OK. I will say that my skin is not sensitive in the slightest, so I can&#x27;t speak to irritants in this mask.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It has minimized pores, reduced redness, decreased my breakouts and leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I didn&#x27;t use it on my face yet. I instead used it on my hands where my psoriasis is. I applied it and it was pleasant. Didn&#x27;t over tighten the skin. Beware though, if you have an open cut it will burn a bit. Not terrible though. I waited 10 minutes then went wash off in warm water. My hands were so smooth and felt so good. The places where my psoriasis are starting to heal today, definitely look better than before the mask. I&#x27;m impressed. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels after I use this mask  it feels so clean smooth and look so healthy am in love !</li>
    <li> LOVE this, kids got a kick out of crazy momma, but my skin was fabulous after!!!  Will become part of my weekly routine for sure!</li>
    <li> Got fooled by all the good reviews .Received the product in a bad condition and when used once it reacted badly to my skin and gave red rashes on my face.</li>
    <li> I literally just received this in the mail about a half hour ago. I have sensitive skin, and was skeptical of purchasing this because some masks really irritate my face. Upon getting this, I read the directions and applied it to my face. I REALLY loved how it felt, not too heavy but just enough to feel it work. The mask is smooth and refreshing. I felt it work instantly, pulling out the dirt, clearing up my blackheads, and giving my face an overall clean fresh look. After I rinsed this off with a warm rag, I loved how refreshed and bright my face looked and felt. It was also really smooth! The mask didn&#x27;t leave my face red and blotchy either which is a huge plus. Oh, another thing I enjoyed was that this mask doesn&#x27;t have any overpowering scent! So many masks I have purchased have such strong smells, it takes away from the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this again, not only for myself, but as gifts!</li>
    <li> Very thick and efficient product! Use it twice a week and skins feels so much better</li>
    <li> This mask makes you feel like you are having a facial at a spa. The texture is soothing and cool. After applying and waiting 10 minutes and washing it off with warm water, my face was noticeably smoother and it felt fresh! I was so happy to have received  this for review, and will surely repurchase in the future.</li>
    <li> We really love this mud mask! Leaves our face feeling deep cleaned and refreshed. We use it 2x a week to clean our faces. This is a nice size jar too. There is a slight smell but nothing overbearing or stinky. Just follow the directions and enjoy the spa day feeling after.</li>
    <li> Great skin care product</li>
    <li> Easy to apply mask right out of the container no mixing the clay. Let set and dry on face (which took about 25 minutes). When dry wash off and pat dry. Leaves skin feeling refreshed and deeply cleaned. Great product that I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very oily skin and using this 2 times a week really helps keep the oiliness down.</li>
    <li> This 5 stars are for the company although the product didn&#x27;t work for my skin, I have very very sensitive skin and inmediately caused me a burn sensation and alot of redness. When I send an email to the company they answer my concern really fast, and make a full refund, don&#x27;t be scared this product is amazing my mom tried it and did nothing but making a perfect clean face and very smooth some pimples that she had were almost gone by next day. I recommend to do a patch test before putting it to the entire face first. Very happy that this company is responsible and honest.</li>
    <li> Feels like a day at the spa!! This mask leaves my face feeling tight and soft and smooth.  It really refreshes the face and leaves it with a healthy glow.  One little tip:  put the jar in a bit of warm water for a bit.  It makes warms it up and makes it that much more pleasant!!</li>
    <li> I used very little product to cover my entire face, so I can tell this 8 oz. jar is going to last me a very long time.  Also, the mask itself is silky smooth, with no lumps or separation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very deep cystic pimple that wouldn&#x27;t go away for over a week, even after using Mario Badescu drying liquid, AcneFree terminator, and toothpaste (my old trick for drying zits).  After using this mask, the pimple started shrinking right away.  It was the only change in my facial routine.  IAfter using the mask, I also noticed that my skin better retained moisture and my oily t-zone stayed in check.  I will be using this weekly from now on.  I really highly recommend this brand- this is my fourth or fifth purchase from them, and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.  Give this mask a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: dead sea mud, grapefruit seed extract&lt;br /&gt;ADDITIONAL INFO: Imported from Jordan.  Cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;INSTRUCTIONS: Apply to clean, dry skin, leave on 10 minutes or until dry, rinse with lukewarm water in circular motions, and pat dry with a clean cloth.&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Do not ingest, for external use only.  Do not use more than once a week. Consult doctor before use if pregnant.</li>
    <li> I always wanted to try different face masks, especially a mud one. I am so glad I was able to try one recently and I can tell you so far I like it. I was nervous using it as I did not have time to do patch test first. I applied it on my face and kept it on for 10 min. My face skin got very tight but that was all, no irritation. I felt my skin drinking up the moisture from the mask. After I removed it, my skin felt so soft and blackheads on my nose were decreased dramatically . You are supposed to use it once a week and I am going to follow that rule. Looking forward using it weekly.( I have received discounted product to review, however this is my honest opinion)</li>
    <li> This dead sea mask helps me to clarify my facial skin. My skin feels great after I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Mud masks are something I love to do for myself, I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different kinds and I have to say I love this one! It&#x27;s not the greatest smelling or looking, but afterwards your skin is amazing. A little on the dry side but apply a moisturizer and it&#x27;ll be amazing! Only use this once MAYBE twice a week or else you&#x27;ll really have dry skin. It&#x27;s not irritating at all. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This mud mask had a very smooth texture that felt great when applied to my skin. The container will last you a long time as a thin layer does the trick. I wait until it dries off (makes my face quite itchy) then use a warm, clean, wet cloth to wipe it off.  My face looks more vibrant afterwards, but I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in terms of acne or keeping my face free of oils afterwards. The mask surprisingly has no scent whatsoever.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve never used a real mud mask before, but the reviews on this were awesome, so I gave it a try. I officially love mud! This was surprisingly silky going on, doesn&#x27;t smell terrible like I imagined, and really did make my face smooth and tighter! It dried in about twenty minutes and was easy to wash off. I will definitely be using this more often!</li>
    <li> I love mud masks so much. I think it&#x27;s the kid in me that used to love making mud pies and this is my adult version.  I have tried a lot of different kinds and when I saw one made by Foxbrim I was excited because I use and love several of their other products.  It has a wonderful thick feel to it and a natural smell.  It&#x27;s easy to apply it evenly because it isn&#x27;t lumpy at all, which I have in other mud masks.  It took about 20 minutes to fully dry and I got in the shower and washed it off with warm water.  I did as they suggested and washed off with my fingers in a circular motion pushing upward.  It came off very easily.  My face felt great, it wasn&#x27;t dry or chaffed feeling.  Once I got out of the shower and patted my face dry my skin felt so very soft. I was lucky enough to purchase this product at discount so that I could provide my honest opinion. You are only supposed to use it once a week, which is too bad because I had fun with it.</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife, she really appreciate it! When she puts it on, is not very pretty, but results are great! She loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried mud mask before this product but now I&#x27;ve tried it I am in love with it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on my skin smooth, did not have any unpleasant smell to it and left my skin feeling refreashed!</li>
    <li> I got this item for the review. I tried it out last night on my face and elbows it works great while I had it on it felt like my skin was getting more firm and after I washed it off my skin was so soft it really works good</li>
    <li> I got this free to try and this provided a great experience to my mind and body (face).</li>
    <li> This is more than just another &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;. Within the beauty industry it is well known that the best benefits for healing of multiple skin conditions and anti-aging come from the dead sea and its mineral rich contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is luxurious and non irritating and the cost vs product amount is very generous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and I tend to get red and irritated with any kind of mask applied to my face, this mud mask was like having spa quality at home!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I had a mud mask party over the weekend.  It was fun!! And our face felt so smooth afterwards.</li>
    <li> I got this for my fiancee and we both ended up using it. It works great. Has no smell. It goes on easy and isn&#x27;t sticky and it&#x27;s easy to wash off once it drys. Skin feels great after usage and we&#x27;ll both be using it again. Her probably more than me. I received a discount on this mud to provide my honest and unbiased opinion. In my opinion it seems like good quality stuff.</li>
    <li> I love mud masks so when I was offered this to try for a review I jumped on it. The jar is huge, it has no smell. Left my face feeling SO nice. Plus, they&#x27;re fun! When I finish my jar I&#x27;ll be buying another as this is affordable and just as good as more expensive masks I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been to several different doctors and specialist to deal with what I thought was an allergic reaction, that turned out to be eczema. But the products that where prescribed, only tamed the itch and did not treat the inflamed skin or the bumps. So I came across this mask and decided, why not? After just two uses, the condition that I&#x27;ve been dealing with for over four years is almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind the first time I used the product, I did feel a burning sensation during the initial application, and felt the burning sensation periodically while the product dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time, a burning sensation. But no as frequent as the first application, nor as intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be doing a third treatment this week and hopefully, this eczema rash will be completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is low and the product is amazing, the only one that actually worked. I would recommend this to anyone! :)</li>
    <li> I love the quality and purity of this&lt;br /&gt;dead sea mud mask.  Smells neutral&lt;br /&gt;as it only has 2 ingredients: dead sea&lt;br /&gt;mud and grapefruit seed extract which is&lt;br /&gt;a natural preservative that won&#x27;t interfere&lt;br /&gt;with the natural chemistry of the mud itself.&lt;br /&gt;The mask can be mixed with a wide array of&lt;br /&gt;natural ingredients, depending on the results&lt;br /&gt;you want to achieve.  For my dry skin, for&lt;br /&gt;example,  I mix the mask with raw honey and&lt;br /&gt;yogurt to get all the benefits of detoxification,&lt;br /&gt;exfoliation, and hydration.  For oily skin types,&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend mixing the mask&lt;br /&gt;with essential oils like lavender, juniper, or lemon.&lt;br /&gt;Either route you take, the results are impressive&lt;br /&gt;even after just one use.  Your pores become cleaner,&lt;br /&gt;and smaller.  Plus your skin looks more supple and&lt;br /&gt;retexturized from the inside out.  Overall a great&lt;br /&gt;product to incorporate with any skin regimen.</li>
    <li> I am very glad to have ordered this. Great deep rich texture. Comes on so easy and comes off with no problems I am very happy that I was able to try this.</li>
    <li> While this product says 100% natural, I was a little surprised to see this only had two ingredients: the mud and grapeseed oil. The grapeseed oil is described only for freshness. There wasn&#x27;t anything else in the mask. This felt good and seemed to keep my face feeling nice but I didn&#x27;t see a huge change in my face right away. I did feel like this hydrated my face. I&#x27;ve also added things to some before putting it on my face like Vitamin C and really loved using this as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; mask.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both used this and we&#x27;re impressed. He tends to have oily skin and I have combination. And, we are both sensitive to products without all natural or too many ingredients. We both enjoyed it thoroughly. There was no scent to irritate the allergies, no chemicals or other additives to irritate the skin. It went on smooth, dried quickly, and washed off easily. The results? LOVELY! We both noticed our skin felt smoother and more balanced than with other similar masks we have used. All day after the night we used it, our skin was less oily than usual and stayed smooth and fresh feeling. Our pores even look smaller. This cleansed our skin so nicely, both on the face and on the patch test we did on our arms, the actual shade of our skin was a little lighter after use. Which tells me it also cleared off a good amount of dead skin and buildup. We really like this mask, best one we have ever used so far, and would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> i received this at a promotional price to give my honest opinion,,i put this on and after 10 min i washed it off and my face started tingly and it burned and my face got red..but in the products defense i have sensitive skin so your results may differ</li>
    <li> This was so wonderful. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> love this feels so good, try it you will def be happy!</li>
    <li> I am a 42 year old female, fair, combo skin with chemical sensitivity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask was used by both my husband and I.  He has rosacea along with my sensitivity to chemicals.  This mask was thin going on but really did pack a punch at exfoliating and firming.  It dried down beautifully and really firmed up the skin.  My skin felt very clean and smooth with no offensive perfumes or burning chemicals.  I have tried drugstore/department store masks that burned my skin and eyes.  This mask gave us NO irritation, red eyes or flared up my husbands eczema.  I appreciate the care that this company has taken with their customer service, selection of ingredients, no additives or perfumes to mask what the product really is.  This is a very good mask for my skin type.  BUNNY APPROVED, CRUELTY FREE!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing to keep in mind, there is no spatula or spoon to dispense the mud.  In order to not contaminate product, we used our own&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was selected to review this product honestly for a reduce cost.</li>
    <li> I got to try this free for review purposes and it is so wonderful!!! SUPER cleans your skin and make your feel like you gave your skin a huge boost!!</li>
    <li> As you can see by all the other reviews as well, this mask is awesome! Mine had a protective seal when first opened, but it wasn&#x27;t securely attached so was a bit pointless, however it did keep the mask from getting over the lid. There is almost no smell which is great. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but all of my blackheads disappeared and my skin felt very smooth!</li>
    <li> quality of mask very nice. mud didn&#x27;t crumble off like others do after short period of time could do stuff around house while i waited. did not get to itchy as it dried. only thing i didn&#x27;t like i had to make sure jar was cleaned up every time you use it. i think it might look extra dirty if you let it go and if it got wet and leak on counter. it also stained my sponges after i washed them in washing machine. so don&#x27;t use best rags you have to rinse it off. it also just smells like mud. it might sound strange but i like smell to hide i just put mud on. trying not to be picky. but it does work skin has improvement.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She uses a couple times a week. It has significantly improved her skin and addressed her small pimple problems. She also says that her face feels less oily. I received a discount for review purposes.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this my skin was glowing and soft!  I am 53 years old and have dry skin since menopause.  I only use this once a week because I am afraid that it may dry my skin out if I were to use it too often since I don&#x27;t have oily skin.  My skin is a little red for about 30 minutes after I take it off like when I use my skin peel from Juice Beauty which I also love.  The redness goes away quickly and I am left with soft, glowing skin like my younger days!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my friend and this is what she said &amp;#34; I have mix feelings. I felt my skin became smoother and soft, but it was very itchy when I put it on. The entire time I wanted to scratch my face. My skin is sensitive, so maybe that&#x27;s the cause&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Really good.  It detox my skin.  Made my skin look clear and soft.  All natural ingredient which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> This mask is awesome!  I have noticed my blackheads clearing up and my pores are dramatically smaller!  I use a kabuki brush to paint this on the my face.  Awesome customer service!</li>
    <li> I am loving this mask!! I needed very little for it apply in a thick layer. I do have sensitive skin and I also have combo to oily skin. When I got this I was in the middle of a break out and had been very oil for a few days nothing was helping. I don&#x27;t know about you but sometimes my combo skin gets very oily and just washing doesn&#x27;t help. It goes through cycles of oiliness if that makes sense! Anyway I was scared at first because I didn&#x27;t do a patch test (I&#x27;ve used many mud masks before) and this started burning within a minute of applying. The burning got so intense I was close to washing it off. After about 2 minutes it did subside. Because of my sensitive skin sometimes things do burn and it doesn&#x27;t harm my skin normally. I was hoping this would be one of those times!! I left it on for a good 15 minutes. I like mine to be dry and cracking so I know it has absorbed all the oils!! When I washed it off I was surprised how smooth my skin was. Very nice. No redness or blotchiness either. I noticed for 2 to 3 days after my oil kept decreasing and some of my break out cleared up. It was like it kept working AFTER I used it. It is a keeper and I will keep using it! Oh an another thing only 2 ingredients! You know this is all natural! Just clay and grapefruit oil as a preservative! Can&#x27;t beat that! Try it out! Don&#x27;t let the burning scare you. You will be glowing after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After 1 full month of use I can say I honestly love this product. On the second use there was no burning what so ever. So it might have just my sensitive skin adjusting to the product. I am not sure. But it hasn&#x27;t burned since the first use. Try it out! You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> This dead sea mud mask is amazing . I Love this product . Leaves your face feeling amazing. I am reviewing this product and I received a discounted price for item. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Tried this last night and it feels amazing. I can&#x27;t wait to do it again. We had a little girls night, and did facials and mani/pedis. We love the way i felt going on. Smooth and not lumpy. I will definitely give this product a 10</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Very easy to use! Makes the skin feel brand new!</li>
    <li> Living in a house that is traditionally filled with more females than men, it’s never a surprise that when a beauty product arrives in the mail, it is quickly examined and put to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful and versatile product in that you can use it as a mask on your face and it works wonders at reducing the appearance of pores and making your skin smooth. But, you can also use it on your hands, legs, and feet to get the same results! It has been known to lighten up dark spots and help in the treatment of skin conditions like eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it good for your skin, but you can use the mud mask on your hair too! Be careful applying it because it can get messy, as does the clean up, but I think it’s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, you can also warm small amounts in the microwave (use 50% power) to spread onto sore areas of the body. Let it dry as usual. You’ll find the warmth spreads quickly through the sore/tender area and helps relieve the pain naturally as a result of the heat as well as the dead sea salts that are in the mud itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love using this product for our weekly girls night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> At first, I was surprised to see the grayish brown color of the mask, but it IS a mud mask! Anyway, considering that, I was surprised that the product contained almost no odor at all. The container arrived full with product, not 3/4 full like some others I have used. I LOVE that the only ingredients are #1: Dead Sea Mud, &amp; #2: 0.25% grapefruit seed extract! to preserve freshness! How much more natural can you get than THAT? Instructions are to apply a thin layer &amp; use only once per week. At that amount, my 8 ounce jar will last me quite awhile! The product dried in approximately 10 minutes &amp; I was amazed how easily it came off. No need to rub or scrape, just gently wiped with a soft wet cloth. I did a test by only applying to 1 side of my face and the difference in the softness on side after mask was noticeably smooth &amp; moisturized. So far, I have loved every Foxbrim product that I have tried!</li>
    <li> Quick, fast , delivery! My bf is super happy and his face is glowing! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fantastic natural dead sea mud mask.  I tried this and my skin felt amazing afterwards.  The mud helps to balance out the mineral deficiencies in your skin and leaves you glowing after you remove the mask.</li>
    <li> Today was my first time trying it on I loved the feeling of it i really recommend it.</li>
    <li> the wife really enjoys this.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i have ever purchased a mud mask. I enjoyed it, it was relaxing. It is definitely the real deal; i say this because it doesn&#x27;t have any kinda of smell... well besides mud.. my skin feels refreshed though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost 2 months now since I&#x27;ve been using it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to: even out my skin tone, help clear up the acne, reduce redness, and the blackheads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;And I did not get those results. What I did get was smooth skin after washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I use this cream , I bought one I gave to my sister that she used it and like it very much.I bought discounted</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  I tried it tonight for my rosacea.  It makes my skin feel so soft and clean.  My rosacea is noticeably lessened almost immediately.  I still use my moisturizer as it says since it does not have moisturizing capabilities.  It makes my skin feel so clean and it really feels like my skin has detoxified.  I rec&#x27;d this product for review and I really like it.  If you have problem skin or just want to detoxify, you need to try this, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask - Love this product! Its super all natural and that is what I love about it. I am so tired and done with chemical laden personal products we should all know better by now - so thank you to this higher minded company for bringing an effective skin care product option.  It leaves your skin feeling amazing. I got it on a review promo and I am so glad I did</li>
    <li> Ok so I just received this product in the mail about 4 days ago and decided to do a little test to see if it really helps out or not. The test I did was simple, for the last 4 days I have been putting this product on only the left side of my face (after a shower).  I have noticed (as well as my girlfriend) that the left side of my face is much smoother and softer than the right side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this product dries on your face it shrinks and pulls the skin tight (because of water evaporation) and I believe it helps take off all the dead skin and pulls a lot of impurities out of the skin.  I will be using this product every other day and will try to come back and give an update on it.</li>
    <li> I really love this dead sea mask because it leaves my skin soft and bright. I have sensitive skin so many products make my skin burn but this Dead Sea Mud Mask didn&#x27;t burn my skin at all. It smells like a beauty product and a little sea like but it not strong once you apply it to your face.The first time I used this product it did dry out my skin a little tiny bit but it wasn&#x27;t too much where I had to apply a moisturizer. I have oily skin thats prone to acne and when I removed the mask it left my skin soft and oil free. The mask dried really fast on my skin probably within 3-5 minutes. This is the most easiest mask ever to remove from your skin because when you wet a towel it comes off fast without having to rub your skin a million times to get the product off. I love absolute love this Dead Sea Mud Mask and look forward every week to applying it to my skin. I was able to get this product for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>

    <li> My daughter and I noticed a huge difference from one use with this mask. Glowing skin, tight pores, smoothness. I would totally buy this again when we run out. Although I did receive a discount for honestly reviewing this product it happens to be a product I&#x27;ve been wanting to try for a long time so I took the opportunity and so glad I did!!! I feel like I really clean my pores out good. Didn&#x27;t leave it feeling dried out afterwards either it just felt smooth and glowing. I give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful, and leaves feeling my face feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!  MY SKIN FEELS SO CLEAN AFTER I USE IT.  MY PORES ARE SMALLER, AND BLACKHEADS ARE GONE.</li>

    <li> i have acne prone skin so im always looking for this to help clear up a break out. with summer coming my skin gets extra oily which causes me to break out more. this mud mask is amazing! ive only used it once and  i can tell a difference already! it dries the skin out a little which i dont mind since mine is super oily and it helps reduce the appearance of my blemishes. love this product</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I recieved this in the mail. I&#x27;ve already wanted to try a Dead Sea mud mask. When I used the product my face felt much smoother and i felt rejuvenated after using it. The container is large enough where you can get several uses out of it. It would highly recommend it..you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I had used a different brand prior to buying this....this works great! I mix it with apple cider vinegar....you can actually feel your pores detoxing and facial skin tightening. Wash off to a renewed glow!</li>
    <li> This mask feels like I had a spa day. It works to clear my pores, relax you and leaves your skin so soft. I was asked to test and review this product and have feel in love. I will continue to use this brands in the future.</li>
    <li> I use Dead Sea Mask a lot. I love the way it makes my skin feel. This was non irritating and felt so good! It seems like a natural stress reliever.

    <li> Great mask! Feels wonderful on my skin, leaves it feeling soft and more radiant! I am looking forward to using this mask in the future and hopefully seeing great results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past week.  After first use I had noticed the a change in my skin.  Smoother, healthier looking.  Also makes it softer.  It help clear up my face with just one use.&lt;br /&gt; received the Dead Sea Mud Mask by Foxbrim for reviewing purposes and to give my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> This Dead Sea Mud Mask is really nice and feels good on your skin.  I have pretty oily skin, and even at 33 years old I still get breakouts.  When I used the Mud Mask by Foxbrim, my face felt very refreshed and not oily anymore after washing it off, and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin!  I found myself touching my skin every now and again throughout the day because it felt so soft.  The Dead Sea Mud Mask is free of additives and is all natural, which I really love.&lt;br /&gt;The correct way to use the Mud Mask, and maximize its benefits is by taking your make up off with a make up wipe, cleanse your face really well and pat dry.  Now you are ready for your Mask.  Put a thin layer all over your face, missing your eyes and mouth.  Now, let the mask dry, usually around 10-15 minutes.  When dry, wash the mask off your face with lukewarm water.  Pat dry with a towel again.  Now you can finish with the rest of your beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;The Foxbrim Dead Sea Mud Mask also has age-defying properties Perfect for killing acne-causing bacteria, effectively treating psoriasis, minimizing pores, reducing redness and fading unsightly wrinkles, fine lines, discoloration and more.

I know you will really like this mask, it is a great price, and it&#x27;s a pretty large jar of Mud Mask!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure~  I did receive this product on a promotion for my true and unbiased opinion.  Under no circumstances was I compensated for my review or opinion.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mask in order to review it. I love how clean and smooth it makes your face feel! Highly recommended to help smooth skin without over drying or making skin feel oily. I have really sensitive skin and this is one of the few masks I have tried that didn&#x27;t cause irritation after using it![[ASIN:B00UG449AC Foxbrim Dead Sea Mud Mask - Revitalizing Facial Mask, 240mL/8oz.]]</li>
    <li> Great product! Wife had a really bad acne problem after our baby and this helped a lot. She said she noticed that her skin was more smoother and less oily.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love mud masks! They are great for your face, legs, and arms too</li>
    <li> I have problem skin. From my early teens all the way into my current 30&#x27;s, my skin has been horrible. I&#x27;ve used a lot of Dead Sea mud masks, but this one is the best! I have extremely oily skin, so I exceeded to suggested use. I received my order on Thursday, and I&#x27;ve used the mask every other day. I had horrible breakouts, but now they are almost completely gone! I wash my face, apply the mask as suggested. I let it dry and wash off. I follow up with the FoxBrim Orange Water Toner. My skin texture has changed. I don&#x27;t have the bumpiness of the underlying acne/whiteheads/blackheads anymore. My skin is so soft! I have noticed throughout the day, I will touch my skin or look in the mirror, and the blackheads and hardened oil will just work its way out of my skin on its own! Since its summer I haven&#x27;t been wearing makeup, so I freshen up with the orange blossom water toner to remove it. That&#x27;s what this mask does, it extracted everything out of my skin. I would suggest using these products together. If the mask is a little drying, the water toner will moisturize. I plan on eventually trying all FoxBrim products. They&#x27;re all natural, no fillers. I even used it on my 12 year old son that is experiencing breakouts. It extracted his pimples with no pain. I will say, that if your pores are full of oil and dirt, you MAY experience some breakouts because it is trying to pull the yuck out of your skin. No worries, it&#x27;s the cleansing process.</li>
    <li> Loved this mask! Made my face feel smooth and soft! Same pulling, pulsing sensation of a bentonite clay mask without the mixing and mess or nasty apple cider vinegar smell. I am definitely switching to this mud mask from now on!!! It is slightly drying, so be careful using it too frequently and I would suggest a moisturizer after using.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve gone my whole life thus far without ever trying a dead sea mud mask and I&#x27;m absolutely ecstatic that this was the first I ever tried. I use it on my face every single week and mud mask day has quickly become my favorite. It leaves my face feeling so smooth. I will definitely purchase many more of these.</li>
    <li> I honestly cant tell this mud mask done anything for my skin. I used it twice so far and I&#x27;m not impressed. I&#x27;ll continue using and update if I see any results.</li>
    <li> I love dead sea mask so much, and I am a true believer of their amazing healing power. My mother lives in Israel and she would frequently bring some dead sea mask for me, and I love them. They made my skin really radiant and supple.&lt;br /&gt;I know Israel is thousands of miles away, and I only get to see my mother once a year, my supply wouldn&#x27;t be enough to suffice till our next meeting. I am so glad that foxbrim had their dead sea mud mask too!! It made my life easier! It resembles the same masks as what my mom brought. It works exactly the same too. It&#x27;s funny that even the consistency is the same. Whenever I use this mask, I feel so pampered and relaxed. I let it sit on my face till it dry and I feel a tightening sensation, it&#x27;s like a signal that the mask is very potent and working. I definitely recommend this mask, it&#x27;s worth it. I purchased mine using a promo code for testing.</li>
    <li> Works great leaves skin feeling great!</li>
    <li> This was a very good mud mask! For it to work as well as it did and be all natural, it is definitely worth the price tag!</li>
    <li> This is amazing mask. I have tried few times and it feels so good. Application is very easy and very smooth on skin. My skin feels very clean and soft after each application. Really good mask. I love it and lucky to receive at discounted price.</li>
    <li> No bad smell like I thought there might be. Spread very well on my face, and dried pretty quickly. I could feel the product working on my face and when I washed it off my face felt really good. It did bring my pimples to the surface on the first use, But It dried them out and there were gone the next day.  I will use this once a week like recommended and would definitely order it again!</li>
    <li> I have never tried a mud mask. I had no idea what to expect. Yup, it&#x27;s mud! It felt strange at first but it felt good when applying to my face. It wasn&#x27;t gritty like I thought it would be. It took about 10 minutes to dry. I wondered if I would see or feel a difference on my face. YES! My face felt wonderful - SO good that I didn&#x27;t feel the need to apply lotion to my face after. THAT is a first for me. I love this mud mask.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time today and I must say my face feels much smoother after only one use! It goes in very easily and also comes off easily! I&#x27;ll post another review after I&#x27;ve used it a few times. So for, I think this is a great product!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I actually bought this a couple of weeks ago and tried it and it has cleared up my acne. It also has helped my daughter. My face feels so much better. I just bought 3 more.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It keeps my face feeling fresh and clean. I even put the product on a rash I had and it made it go away. I leave it on for about 15-20 min when I apply it. I try to the product on atleast 3x a week</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll like the way it makes your skin feel--I do</li>
    <li> In search of finding Spa products at a reasonable price is what my initial thoughts were when choosing this product. Going to any Spa can be costly, and products even more so. So I jumped at the chance of trying this product, having been a fan of previous Foxbrin&#x27;s products, I knew they typically are not a fail, and this product is another good product by them. At first I was nervous, I mean DEAD sea, and the smell and color are NOT appealing at all, but getting over that I tried it, and applied it to my skin. Immediately I felt it working. Cooling, and very moist, a little goes a long way. After a few minutes, you can feel the mask starting to dry and when removing the mask, I could feel the difference. Soft, smooth, and a creamy texture is what my face felt like. I would recommend for those who want a spa in-home treatment at a great cost!</li>
    <li> I love it...I have no reactions from it or even redness. I like it but some reason I do feel tiny burn sensation but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  I really like this mud mask...It does help my face more look healthy... thank you</li>
    <li> First, let me start off by saying that mud mask are my favorite type of mask. I don&#x27;t know what it is about them, but I am instantly draw to them. My face is oily and acne prone. I have acne scars, and continue to get adult acne. I&#x27;ve used pretty pricey mud mask that work great but I have NEVER used a product like this one. For a quarter of the price that I&#x27;ve previously paid, this mud mask leaves my skin feeling AMAZING!!!!!! I use it every other night at night after I have washed my face and used a mild scrub. I like to do it in this order because I like to make sure that my pores are clear and in their best state to benefit from this mud mask. I evenly put this mask on all over my face, avoiding my eyes and mouth, and allow it to dry. Once it is dry, I use a warm water and a damp face towel to wash it off. OMG!! What an amazing feeling!!! My face feels so clean and free of toxins and impurities! I haven&#x27;t gotten any new acne since using this mask. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dead Sea Salt And Dead Sea Mud products for years now. The Dead Sea is unfortunately disappearing due to companies using surrounding resources and water for purposes other than those people have been using the sea for in the past. It makes me sad that we might not have this natural blessing available to us much longer. Dead Sea Mud is one of the most wonderful things I&#x27;ve found. The compounds in these have been used for a plethora of uses from clearing your skin to fighting certain diseases.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a variety of FOXBRIM products. They are high quality and my skin, which I&#x27;ve had issues with in the past, has been staying clear and smooth feeling. Using this and other products in the regimen has kept my (almost) 50 year old skin looking younger than its age.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I love the most about this mud is....... it&#x27;s mud.. A lot of products, even spa products, have ingredients that cause cancer and a slew of other health problems. Many containing formaldehyde, by calling it other names. If you go to my Pinterest  ( www.pinterest.com/kerraboo2 ) you can look in my Healthy Choices Board or my Hair and Make-up board for lists of ingredients that you should look at in your cosmetics and beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;I love that FOXBRIM hasn&#x27;t had any of these ingredients in any of the products I have used. This one had Mud and a bit of grapefruit. Others have other ingredients I usually have in my kitchen. When I applied this to my face it went on very smoothly. Its well blended and had no odor. I&#x27;ve had some other products smell of yucky mud.. This made me feel so clean and fresh. It dried evenly and relatively quick. I tend to leave mine on for an extended time. I did this time.  When I went to wash it off it came right off without me having to deal with dried chunks. It left my face feeling refreshed ad silky smooth. I followed it up with FOXBRIMs Vitamin C Lotion. I&#x27;m very glad I chose this one to try.&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER :  My No Nonsense Thoughts: I could reiterate what is in the description above, but  you&#x27;ve  most likely already read it. What I will try to do is tell you what I see, smell, hear, what happens and what my opinion is as well as I can. In order to try to make easier for you to decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone. I have the money to buy the things I really need. However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description.&lt;br /&gt;As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes that I receive before I purchase the items I use and shop on discount site regardless  and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /&gt; I have no connection to this seller or this company who makes this product and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. I haven&#x27;t been offered anything in return and at times I give no feedback. My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item. I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review. I have dyslexia and very often I don&#x27;t spell check. But I will do my best to describe this item and my thoughts on it.</li>
    <li> My skin didn&#x27;t agree with the product. I did a skin patch test on my wrist , it was ok but it burns and stings instantly on my face so I can&#x27;t put it on even for few seconds.</li>
    <li> I love this mask so far!  Feels great, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and goes on easily.  Washes off easily as well.  Here are some pix of what it looks like in the container and my before and after photos with using this! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First pic - before&lt;br /&gt;Second pic - product in container&lt;br /&gt;Third pic - as soon as I put the mask on my face&lt;br /&gt;Forth pic - after I let it dry for 10 minutes&lt;br /&gt;5th pic - my after picture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review! :)</li>
    <li> I really liked the mud mask it was came in a good quantity size I liked the discount on it excited I just got it and I&#x27;m about to try it looks awesome I have never used among mass excited about using it and it I did he was the last night and was very revitalizing</li>
    <li> you could use maximum three times a week. If you have sensitive skin I would suggest one time a week. You really should do a mask one a week to every couple weeks. I am sure you are asking yourself why? Well we need to recharge our skin ass well as our body. We all need to cleanse out our body of toxins and impurities. I know I am personally using this three times a week. My skin is having some issues. Where I am located the lovely mother nature can not make up it&#x27;s mind on how the temp is going to be. I can tell you when you wash off the mask to do warm water. I do mine then afterwards hop in the shower to make sure I get it all off. Make sure you always follow up with using a toner and serum. Finally make sure you are using a moisturizer that is fit to your skin type. Even if you are oily doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t need moisturizer. It is a misconceptions really oily people need moisturizer put in their body&#x27;s too. I have personally now used a few products of #FoxBrim and I am very happy with the customer service and the product. I feel comfortable suggesting them for you to try. If you are one with some skin problems you could try a mask on there to help with that. Always if you feel comfortable starting a new program do. If not do contact your doctor. I love the option of doing a spa style mud mask at home. As an active blogger I received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Skin feels great after just one use</li>
    <li> I used this mask the same day it came. My face was SO soft after rinsing it off. I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I used this this weekend for the first time and literally my skin was radiant afterwards. Normally I am very careful because i have very sensitive skin, but this has nothing in it that could possibly even had a adverse reaction to my skin. The smell is incredible as well!</li>
    <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask was delivered in excellent condition and as described on it&#x27;s product page.  We were offered this product to sample and review in a promotional discount.  The product is 100% natural Dead sea mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly enjoy treating myself to this at home spa treatment.  The mask goes on smoothly, and my skin feels energized and rejuvenated.  I have used the Mud mask on my body, to reduce stretch marks, and detoxify, especially when on a cleanse.</li>
    <li> Great mask.  Left my skin looking bright, clean, tight, and refreshed!  Great price for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> When I saw this dead sea mud mask being offered at at discounted price to buy, try and review, I had to have it.  I love mud masks and this one did not dissappoint.  I applied it on my face, it went on smoothly and easily.  There was a slight smell, but nothing that bothered me. I didn&#x27;t need to use alot of the mud mask to cover my face, so this jar should last a while. I waited for the mud to dry and then rinsed my face with water, it did rinse off very easy. I patted my face dry and could not believe how good my face felt!  It felt soft, clean refreshed. I will be using this mask once a week.</li>
    <li> Love it! I could see and feel a difference, after just one use!</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels when I glide it onto my face and let it set. I rinse it off feeling clean and moisturized, very refreshing! Definitely recommend it. It has a nice scent, too.</li>
    <li> This was an amazing mask it made my skin feel really clean and smooth! I highly recommend it. Don&#x27;t be deviced by the color its an amazing mask that really does wonders for your skin!</li>
    <li> I have used masks on my face for years.  I have also used Dead Sea products previously, since I was there last year (Mar 2014), so I was eager to try this when those products ran out.  I love that it&#x27;s so pure and appreciate how easily it goes on (smoothly and evenly, as thickly or thinly as you might wish) and how cleanly it rinses off (with no residue in my shower as with other masks).  It left my face feeling soft and smooth.  But I held off on posting a review until after I had used it on my neck &amp; back - I read on the jar that it is good for skin conditions such as eczema and got very excited.  I developed an allergy to my lowlights in Nov 2014 and have had a relentless itching on my scalp, neck, and upper back ever since - more than 1 1/2 years now!  Nothing has helped more than temporarily.  So I slathered it over my neck and upper back this morning and then washed it off in the shower, following up with my eczema cream.  So far, that area is blissfully CALM.  I will do repeated treatments (more than once a week) hoping to eradicate the reaction entirely.  I&#x27;ve switched all of my hair products long since and the lowlights of course have been gone for months now, so I&#x27;m hoping this is finally the solution!</li>
    <li> I could use this every single day, absolutely LOVE this mask! It tightens and doesn&#x27;t make my skin sensitive! Those things never happen together!</li>
    <li> I am one of the lucky ones who get breakouts in the t-zone.  Normally the really embarrassing breakouts.  The kind that could easily be mistaken for a booger or a cold sore.  There comes a time in every woman&#x27;s life where you have to weigh the options of either pretending you have something hanging out of your nose or openly admitting you have acne well into your thirties.  And back-ne as well.  That said, I put together a really simple skincare regime at home.  I regularly use a mask I make out of a smoothie powder that has edible clay in it.  I have read good things about the dead sea, so I decided to give this mask a try.  I originally did a patch test as recommended because I am also lucky enough to be allergic to many topical&lt;br /&gt;solutions.  During the patch test, I noticed this mask is really easy to apply and is very smoothe.  The powder I normally use gets a little messy, but the results are worth it.  I let a week go by before doing a full application of this mask. I applied to my face as well as one cheek of my booty to see how it works on cellulite.  I want to do a for real side by side comparison.  The labeling said to only use this once a week, so I know it will take time to ascertain the results on the cottage cheese front.  On the facial front, I am very pleased to say that the mask did not get itchy or overly dry/cracky.  It was very simple to watch off and not overly oily when on.  I don&#x27;t constantly feel like I missed removing a spot like I do with my regular mask.  After one complete use, I found that my cheeks lost some of their rosy-ness from a two-week-old sunburn.  It leads me to believe that it is sloughing off the dead skin.  My skin feels smoother and I look a little more well rested.  The container is huge and a great value.  I plan to incorporate this into my weekly regime once a week and use my regular mask the rest of the time.  The only con I have is that some of the adhesion on the safety peel had come off and was partially open.  Iattribute that to the unexpected heatwave which was at no fault of the shipper&#x27;s.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to pamper themselves once a week.  It&#x27;s very relaxing!</li>
    <li> This item is just amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my face soft and fresh. Definitely a must try!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved using this mask! Makes my skin feel so soft and clean! This will definitely be an item I have to repurchase! Great quality and I love the mess free packaging!</li>
    <li> I really liked this cream. I wanted to use it a while before committing to a review. As it is a &amp;#34;mud mask&amp;#34; it has a good &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; consistence. The scent, however is pleasant. I used it once a week for 6 weeks so far and my skin is cleaner, and softer. I like that is is all natural. Not at all clumpy. Went on very smooth and washed off easily. A nice mud mask.</li>
    <li> I live this stuff. You can feel it pulling the yuck out of your face. I even will dab a bit in pimples and go to bed. If you want a mask this is the one.</li>
    <li> love how it makes my skin feel.  I got this for review</li>
    <li> I really wanted to fully love this mask because it&#x27;s made with very little fillers.  However, when I tried the mask on my face, I couldn&#x27;t last the full 10 minutes for it to dry since my face was so sensitive causing it to burn.  I had to wash it off immediately.  This made me so sad that I can&#x27;t use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, since I had patch tested for allergies on my arm and there were no issues at all.  So I tried to use it on my arms where I have had dry patches and it worked like a charm! It didn&#x27;t burn (like my face did) and when I washed off the mask, it left behind some very nice soft arms.  So for me, I can&#x27;t use it on my face but it&#x27;s a great for removing dead skin from my body instead.  This will be part of my weekly body exfoliation rotation now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to note - when I received the tub in the mail, there was some condensation in the bubble wrap and that concerned me.  I actually reached out to the company asking if it was still safe to use.  They got back to me asap and they had written an actual reply back (vs. a system generated type of reply)!  So due to them not using any adhesive to seal the tub, but rather using just the tightening of the cap to keep it in place, this may happen from time to time.  I just really appreciated the response back and it was more personable than expected.  So</li>
    <li> My skin has never been this soft!!!!! The product only says to use once a week, but I wish I could use it more. The only problem was that there was a slight burning feeling, but it calmed down after I washed it off with cold water. I have been recommending this to my friends, will be buying this mask again.</li>
    <li> Luxury spa experience at home! This mask goes on very easily, is scent-free and leaves my skin toned and baby soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great mud mask! I loved how it made my face feel afterwards. This Dead Sea Mud Mask was very easy to use and apply to my face. It&#x27;s ready to go instantly after opening. You don&#x27;t have to worry about having to mix it with water or anything like that. It has no fragrance which is a huge plus for me. Also what I love is that it is just a pure dead sea mud mask. You don&#x27;t have any unnecessary ingredients or fillers. Highly recommend this mud mask!</li>
    <li> Excellent product face feels so much cleaner and skin feels baby soft.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I would give this 100 stars of i could. Im in love with this mask. They way my face feels after is amazing. My skin looked brighter and tighter and really smooth. I will never buy another mask again. This is the only one i will ever use.</li>
    <li> Great Mask!  I had to try this right away!  It felt so good going on my face &amp; then I left it on 10 minutes.  It was fun to see it all dried up &amp; cracked-the mask-not my skin!  Then I took it off with a washcloth &amp; my skin felt so wonderful!  The blackheads on my nose were gone!  I will be using this every week it looks like it will last for quite awhile.  I received this at a reduced price for an honest opinion &amp; I likes it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was really upset that the seal under the lid was opened. This caused the product to leak out and make the container nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this product just wish it had been full and not leaked everywhere. I might buy again but not sure if I want to risk it being like this. I hate giving bad reviews but I do want people to be aware it could leak out causing a mess</li>
    <li> I was asked to write a review on the Dead Sea Mud Mask. Frankly I scared the bejeebers out of my husband. BUT I LOVE the mud mask! It goes on very smoothly with a nice smell. As the mud dries, you skin becomes very tight! It was fabulous. I removed it with a cool wet cloth. The mud came off easily. I will continue to use this once a week. Thank you</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try out this product. As a momma to two boys, I was looking for something I could add to my very minimal beauty routine. I have been using this product once a week and it leaves my skin feeling very clean and refreshed. I always love the fact that there are only two ingredients -- Deep Sea Mud &amp; Grapefruit Seed Extract!</li>
    <li> This helps with my acne outbreak. Just once a week for 10 minutes is all I need for this magic mud to works. Save me $$$ in going to the salon as I can keep my skin healthy with this simple steps. It&#x27;s a must included item for a healthy and glowing skin.</li>
    <li> Great price for an amazing mud mask! It helps minimize my pores and prevents acne.  I love the way it helps the fine lines and discoloration on my face fade. I have been using it on my teenage son to help his acne too.  It really helps to make my skin health. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mask! Easy to use and makes my face feel amazing! So easy to just put this on wait 10 minutes and then wash it off, no crazy steps to follow! Great product!</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT, Upon application, I could feel it get hard and sucking all the oils from my skin, also it worked as a face lift, because i could feel it compressing and sucking my skin which is basically stretching it. All in all, good product!</li>
    <li> Mask loved it will reorder  felt good on my face no strong smell and made my face feels soft and smooth. I definitely will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this mask. i have large pores and whatever I used ust didn&#x27;t seem to help. I have used this a few times now and my skin has had so much improvement! My pores are tiny and my skin feels so clean! I received this for an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> After only one use, my face feels so much smoother!</li>
    <li> Feel clean and smooth after first use,hope it&#x27;s getting better</li>
    <li> I am in love! First I received a nice email from the company before I even got my product, which came within 2 days! I just tried it today and was cautious because I thought it would dry out my skin. Not at all! It absorbed all of the oils nd my blackheads! I couldn&#x27;t be happier! My skin is smooth and soft and beautiful.  Like I said I am in love!</li>
    <li> Great product. Mud is where it is at. I put this on and let it dry you can actually really feel it pulling your skin don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t hurt. It actually feels really good. I have used mud products for awhile on my face. This product comes in a nice large size jar. It is 100% natural and best part additive fee!  Leave on about 10 mins or till dry and wash off. Great product I recieved this prodcut to review at a deep discount</li>
    <li> Talk about feeling pampered! This feels wonderful after use my face felt so soft and smooth.  I even had my friend put some on a big sore he had on his leg where his leg brace hits and irritates. He got immediate relief from the pain and reduced swelling.&lt;br /&gt;This is great stuff!</li>
    <li> my daughter used it last night and her skin definitely felt softer after.  she has sensitive skin and there was not hint of skin irritation so it works really good for her.  it says 100% natural so that is probably why.  she is going to continue to use it once a week as part of her beauty regimen and will post a review again for updates.</li>
    <li> Has been a great help to my face.  The medications I have to take have made my face sore and dry.  This mask has helped heal my face,</li>
    <li> I love this mud mask. I use it every week. I used to have mud that my mother brought back for me from the dead sea and this is exactly like it. It stays soft and moist and does not dry up. This really is the real thing.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I&#x27;ve used other mud mask for many years but none had really made my skin feel &amp;#34;Amazing&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve used this Dead Sea Mud Mask about four times now and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with it. My skin feels so soft and clean after using it. It looks, feels and smells like mud so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I really wanted to put it on my face but I&#x27;m extremely glad I did. This is the only mud mask I&#x27;ve found that actually does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This mud mask does wonders for your skin.!It doesn&#x27;t tug at your skin, and its a very comfortable mask. You can put it on while wayching tv, cleaning etc. I really appreciate that because some days im not feeling a super intense mask were i cant even move. This one really takes out all the junk in your pores, i have very stubborn blackheads and this gets rid of them!. It also supples your skin and really heps with acne breakouts. I dont want to make this review too long, bc they can become boring. But do you need this mask?  In my opinion yes you do. Its 100% natural and additive free. Doing masks will make a huge difference on your skin. Start taking care of your skin now and buy it :) treat yourself!</li>
    <li> I love this face mask and it was packed very well.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. I use it once a week. My skin is clear and it feels smooth and hydrated. I received this to review.</li>
    <li> I was trying to get dead sea mud mask, finaly found it! It is amazing! It does what it says!! I must say i glad i found this mask!! Truely out standing! I hot this product at special price to review but nothing to do with my review its my own opinion!! :)</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail today and tried it tonight for the first time.  I have somewhat sensitive skin so i tried a patch test first.  I left on for a few minutes and it felt fine so i then put on as directed except around my eyes.  I left on for 10 minutes and washed off with warm water.  My skin felt clean and refreshed and much smoother.  I then followed it by using a moisturizer which i use twice daily.  I think it is very important to keep great care of your skin and encourage everyone to start while they are young.  Also stay hydrated with water as that is what your cells are mostly made of. It keeps you from getting wrinkles and looking older.  This was an awesome product, great buy for the price and i plan on using this now and in the future.  Thank you for the chance to try.

    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with Foxbrim&#x27;s skin care line, so I was super excited to try out their Dead Sea Mud Mask. This mask contains sacred mud from the dead sea, knowing it&#x27;s coming from Israel means a lot to me being Jewish. It&#x27;s free of additives, fillers and other unnecessary ingredients, that are contained in other masks. People from all over the world travel to Israel just to float and bathe in the dead sea. Now I have it nicely packed in my own personal jar. It can be used on the face and body for a total all over detoxing. The mask is thick and rich, but spreads easily across the skin. There was no need to remix the mask before use. It has a nice smell to it. It takes about 20-30 minutes to dry completely, then you remove it with warm water. You can feel the gunk, grime, and dirt being pulled out of your pores, it&#x27;s amazing. It was easy to remove with my konjac sponge, no need for scrubbing. My skin was free of blackheads on my nose, chin, cheeks, and forehead. My pores were non-existent, and my complexion was glowing. My skin wasn&#x27;t overly dry either after using the mask, there was also no redness or irritation. Overall great quality product, one of the best masks I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ll be keeping this stocked!</li>
    <li> Was lucky enough to get this to review for this company.  I&#x27;ve never used a mud mask before so the thought of it grossed me out lol.  But I opened it and dabbed my hand it and it felt very nice and cool.  I put it on and I felt so relaxed I fell asleep with it on.  But when I took it my skin was so friggin soft.  I really like foxbrim products.</li>
    <li> I really love the results I got from using this facial mask. As I put it on my face it gave me such a refreshing feel. I love that I could feel the mask tingling and tightening. I also love the fact that the mask is made from natural ingredients, and not harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I allowed it to dry on my face and once I rinsed it off and patted my face dry I was amazed! My skin was so incredibly soft! The skin on my face looked amazing! I have already recommended this product to a few of my close friends.</li>
    <li> Got this item for review.  Never had or tried a mud mask before.  This came well protected in bubble wrap and in a nice container.  Mud didn&#x27;t have any smells to it - but i don&#x27;t know if it is supposed to at all.  tried it once so far and it left my face feeling very smooth.  it says to use once a week so i can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> This item is great because it does it&#x27;s job very well and It also feels so good on my face. It came right on time and in perfect condition and also the seller was great to order from too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because even though I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, I&#x27;m still getting acne and oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I put a little on my nose to dry up blackheads- and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference when I rinsed it off!!!&lt;br /&gt;Tonight after church I will do a full face mask and update my review!!!</li>
    <li> cleans my face and keep it smooth</li>
    <li> excellent product,amazing outcome...one should try this before he/she dies..Its a gem of a product.</li>
    <li> I used it the day I got it and my face felt smooth when I finished.</li>
