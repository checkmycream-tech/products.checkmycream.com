      <li>Nice beginners razor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my Lord razor for 9 months, and it has given nice weekly shaves for 8 of them.  </li>
      <li>Holds the blade nicely and evenly.</li>
      <li>Very nice, precise, and close.</li>
      <li>razor itself is good quality, a bit cheap, but</li>
      <li>One of the better razors that I own and use.</li>
      <li>Since, I wasn&#x27;t even sure that this was going to be something I liked, I decided to get a quality razor that was inexpensive.</li>
      <li>The head itself is very nice, good plating, nice weight to it, fairly mild (not too aggressive), and consistent.  </li>
      <li>Great first shave.</li>
      <li>This razor is very light...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all metal, had a nice grip and feels like pretty good quality.</li>
      <li>I am extremely happy I made the switch and can not say enough good things about the Lord brand of razor and blades.</li>
      <li>The blades that came with this were not Lord and were OK.</li>
      <li>Easily better than the cartridge razors at the drug store.</li>
      <li>I used the L6 for about 4 months, dropped it, and the top piece broke.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be tempted to shortcut the shave by taking a more aggressive angle as that will cause irritation.  </li>
      <li>Are there better razors?</li>
      <li>99R. I plan to upgrade one more time.</li>
      <li>Compared to my Fusion five blade razor I love this product.</li>
      <li>The shave was pretty good considering the price of the razor.</li>
      <li>Great razor for the price and great for a newbie getting into double edge blade shaving for the first time.</li>
      <li>The Blue bird blades that come with it are also very good.</li>
      <li>Blades are easy to change.</li>
      <li>razor is great for anyone who isn&#x27;t sure if shaving with a double edge razor is their thing, or if they just want a way to shave a couple dollars off of their monthly expenses.</li>
      <li>Still going strong after 1 year.</li>
      <li>This razor is perfectly fine and works well.  </li>
      <li>This one works fine.</li>
      <li>Probably, but, I haven&#x27;t felt the need to go find one yet as this one has been doing just fine for six months now.</li>
      <li>This very light  shaver, with a nice long handle, seems to present the perfect blade angle to avoid cuts.  </li>
      <li>actual razor handle seems to be made of aluminum, and it has a pretty good texture that lends to good grip.</li>
      <li>I enjoy shaving now.</li>
      <li>go between this and the vintage Gillette and still enjoy the shaves.  </li>
      <li>A cheap way to get into DE safety razors, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
      <li>However, I definitely recommend it to anybody looking to get a great shave and not break the bank.</li>
      <li>I did not have issues with the handle threads being too short; it worked great.  </li>
      <li>Did I mention it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>Great for starting out, and seeing if safety razor shaving is something that works for you.  </li>
      <li>This razor is fantastic for the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the length of the handle is all that important.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The one drawback of this razor is the handle is too light which makes it feel and look cheap.  </li>
      <li>Design looks good and solid.</li>
      <li>I have saved so much money and get a better shave.</li>
      <li>Overall, this razor is good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>Overall if functions well, weighs nicely, and is easy to shave with.</li>
      <li>While of a medium weight, the long handle offers good leverage for easy and comfortable use.</li>
      <li>Fresh blades every week.  </li>
      <li>He absolutely love this and says it has completely changed how he views shaving.</li>
      <li>This is much cheaper than the modern disposable razors and much more fun.</li>
      <li>Light weigh, well balanced, longer handle fits my hand better than standard DE Razors.  </li>
      <li>This thing makes shaving fun.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I will admit that my shaves take longer than with multi-blade razors, but it&#x27;s worth it for both cost and shave results.</li>
      <li>I got interested in double edge safety razors for the savings on the actual razor blades compared to cartridges, the quality of the shave, and the idea of taking more time to have a more enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
      <li>So far, the beard shave has been free of any mishaps, I get a consistently clean shave with no rash, no irritation and no nicks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard you can get different handles which would make this a fantastic razor, but if you&#x27;re going to spend money, might as well go for a nice new Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first razor I got was defective but the seller sent a replacement right away</li>
      <li>It is a very gentle shaver.  </li>
      <li>This is my first double edge, I use it for my head and face, and it gives VERY smooth shave.</li>
      <li>My shaves are much closer with little irritation, although it takes a good deal longer (which I don&#x27;t mind as it&#x27;s actually fun to shave now).&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned it for over a year, and it has never broke, and does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Tried for the first time today.</li>
      <li>Just had my first shave with this.</li>
      <li>so it is definitely top-heavy, which I would probably prefer a more balanced razor</li>
      <li>Its only redeeming feature, the reason I purchased it, is the supposed interchangeability of the head with Merkur razors.  </li>
      <li>I am currently able to get two weeks of daily shaves from each blade by flipping it over after the first week.</li>
      <li>so that I can get to try as many as possible to find one that i like.</li>
      <li>My 26 year old son likes it better than all these new razors that are out there.</li>
      <li>My favorite blades have been platinum edge stainless such as Feather and Israeli Personna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is mild, and gentle, yet good enough to give the user a feel for what wet shaving is like.</li>
      <li>Not very heavy, nice long handle.  </li>
      <li>How do you rate something when its the first time you have used this particular tool?</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to give DE shaving a try without investing $40+ for a handle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve used the Lord L6 for six months now with great results. I enjoy shaving now. The lord razor was great: good close shave, nice grip on the handle, and the perfect aggressiveness for newcomers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Problem? The threads on the screw top became bad after a month. I had to grind down the handle a quarter of a millimeter to fix the threading issue. After another 4 months, I had to do the same thing again. Another problem, the razor is not that heavy. When I bought this I thought it would be at least moderately heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great start for you and most others reading this review! Don&#x27;t let the problems I had deter you; it&#x27;s an investment and practice razor for you to learn on. I have upgraded to the Parker 99R. I plan to upgrade one more time.</li>
    <li> Yeah, they are good.  Get about 3 more shaves off these than other brands.  Buy these if you are looking for a good shave.</li>
    <li> This was my razor I purchased after deciding that I was done paying 100 dollars per pack of &amp;#34;super titanium 38 blade diamond coated&amp;#34; blades that lasted a week or so then dulled out. To me there was always something wrong with the bulk of your money going to the blades and the razor itself costing only a few dollars and being made of cheap plastic most of the time. I did some research, and found that one can spend anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars on a razor. Since, I wasn&#x27;t even sure that this was going to be something I liked, I decided to get a quality razor that was inexpensive. The Lord L6 is a great razor for beginners. It is mild, and gentle, yet good enough to give the user a feel for what wet shaving is like. I bought this along with a blade sampler and have not looked back since. The only complaint I have is the metal they use is a bit cheap and lightweight, though until you get into some of the pricer razors this will be a common problem. I used the L6 for about 4 months, dropped it, and the top piece broke. However, I definitely recommend it to anybody looking to get a great shave and not break the bank.</li>
    <li> Maybe the blade is not as sharp as it needs be. Tends to pull rather than &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; and cut, uncomfortable!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with safety razor for the price. Blades are easy to change. Has a good weight to it. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a wet shaver for over 13 years, but always with a Mach3.  Frustrated with the cost of purchasing replacement heads for the Mach3, I started to look for alternatives.  That&#x27;s when I came across a bunch of guys (no gals yet, that I&#x27;ve seen) talking about the joys and closeness (and cost savings) of shaving with a safety, or straight, or double-edge (DE) razor.  In my searching I came across this Lord razor.  Great reviews, and a great price, convinced me to give it a shot. And it hit the mark!  Great razor.  Nice feel, good wight in the hand!  And although I have big hands and thought I needed this longer handle, as I&#x27;ve used it I don&#x27;t think the length of the handle is all that important.  Actually, I think it would work just as well with a shorter handle.  As for the overall finishing touches of the razor, maybe not the best (like a Merkur), but for the price, you absolutely cannot go wrong!  I plan to use this razor for a long time, and have no plans (as I don&#x27;t yet see the need) to go out and buy a more expensive razor.  Very happy with this purchase!  I think you would be as well.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy I made the switch and can not say enough good things about the Lord brand of razor and blades. I am currently able to get two weeks of daily shaves from each blade by flipping it over after the first week.</li>
    <li> This works just like the one I had when I was a kid. My 26 year old son likes it better than all these new razors that are out there. He&#x27;d never seen one like it before but he says he wants one too.</li>
    <li> How do you rate something when its the first time you have used this particular tool? Compared to my Fusion five blade razor I love this product. It fits the hands nicely - I have X-large hands and it is neither too long, nor too short. I do wish the handle was a little thicker, but I have yet to find one with a thicker handle so that may be a moot point. The weight is better than the plastic crap I&#x27;ve been using for years. And the shave? Well, I thought it would take some getting used to and perhaps I&#x27;d experience a bunch of nicks or cuts. That hasn&#x27;t been the case. So far, the beard shave has been free of any mishaps, I get a consistently clean shave with no rash, no irritation and no nicks. NONE! Shaving the head has never been smoother - with the exception of one on my head where I have an indentation from an old injury, so now I just go over that area slowly and in two directions and no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone new to single edge shaving. Are there better razors? Probably, but, I haven&#x27;t felt the need to go find one yet as this one has been doing just fine for six months now. Ooh, I also use the assorted blade pack on this site: 35 Double Edge Blade Sampler Pack FEATHER DERBY 7 O&#x27;clock BLUEBIRD... so that I can get to try as many as possible to find one that i like.</li>
    <li> Got this and never looked back to that Gillette Mach expensive crap again.</li>
    <li> This very light  shaver, with a nice long handle, seems to present the perfect blade angle to avoid cuts.  It is a very gentle shaver.  Perhaps those with much heavier beards might find it insufficient.  But I can use almost any blade type, inclduing the aggressive feather blade, and all goes smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some commenters mentioned the threaded head onto which the handle screws tended to break off after a while.  Taking this to heart, every time I clean up the razor, I put a few drops of the slimy preshave I bought as a lubricant to reduce any torque friction.  I believer mineral oil would work just as well.</li>
    <li> While of a medium weight, the long handle offers good leverage for easy and comfortable use. Holds blades perfectly, excellent value.</li>
    <li> All the desirability of a fancier model - at a low price! I&#x27;ve owned it for over a year, and it has never broke, and does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who was looking into getting into using straight razors for shaving. He absolutely love this and says it has completely changed how he views shaving. He even said that shaving used to be something that he &amp;#34;just had to do&amp;#34; but now it is &amp;#34;something that I look forward to&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t tell him, but I used it on my legs once and WOW! This thing really IS great, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a low priced, introductory razor I would definitely give this one a shot.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have ever had.  I will never go back to cartridge-style razors and their insane prices.  I&#x27;ve been recommending switching to DE razors to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic for the price. It&#x27;s all metal, had a nice grip and feels like pretty good quality. It&#x27;s not the heaviest and the finish will eventually wear off. But, for the price, this is a great option for those wanting to try a safety razor without a large investment, or for those who would like a secondary razor for travel or other backup purposes.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  Great for starting out, and seeing if safety razor shaving is something that works for you.  I have been using this for about 3 months now with no issues, or rust.  I can get about 5 shaves out of each blade as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Lord razor for 9 months, and it has given nice weekly shaves for 8 of them.  The screw top threads went bad, but the chrome is untarneshed.  Not very heavy, nice long handle.  A cheap way to get into DE safety razors, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This thing makes shaving fun.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting much at this price but I was wrong.  It seems well made with a solid weight and holds blade well.  I have shave 5 times with the same blade and it is still cutting well.  This is much cheaper than the modern disposable razors and much more fun.</li>
    <li> Just had my first shave with this. Very nice, precise, and close. Also no nicks! Would recommend to a beginner wet shaver.</li>
    <li> I recently took up shaving with a safety razor because I hated shaving and always had irritation on my neck.  I&#x27;ve used this Lord L6 and an old 1960&#x27;s Gillette Adjustable.  It has been a great introduction to DE razor shaving for me.  My shaves are much closer with little irritation, although it takes a good deal longer (which I don&#x27;t mind as it&#x27;s actually fun to shave now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is good quality, a bit cheap, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  I did not have issues with the handle threads being too short; it worked great.  The head itself is very nice, good plating, nice weight to it, fairly mild (not too aggressive), and consistent.  My old Gillette holds the blade crooked which causes painful shaves, while the Lord hold the blade evenly, which makes it feel just a bit more aggressive than a disposal two-blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback of this razor is the handle is too light which makes it feel and look cheap.  It seems like it is either plastic or aluminum, while the head itself is brass or steel.  I&#x27;ve heard you can get different handles which would make this a fantastic razor, but if you&#x27;re going to spend money, might as well go for a nice new Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price and the quality of shave, I have to give it five stars as it is the ideal safety razor for a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE May 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor has been used quite a bit and still looks brand new.  No chrome has come off, the threads have not stripped, no issues at all.  It gets cleaned every couple months with some scrubbing bubbles spray.  Fresh blades every week.  My favorite blades have been platinum edge stainless such as Feather and Israeli Personna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go between this and the vintage Gillette and still enjoy the shaves.  Because it is a milder razor and doesn&#x27;t cut down as much, you will need to make more passes.  Don&#x27;t be tempted to shortcut the shave by taking a more aggressive angle as that will cause irritation.  Three passes, with the grain, across the grain, and against the grain will give a very close shave with zero irritation.</li>
    <li> This is my first double edge, I use it for my head and face, and it gives VERY smooth shave. I do shave with, across and finally against the grain and apply virtually no pressure though, which is essential for this type of razor. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to give DE shaving a try without investing $40+ for a handle. The Blue bird blades that come with it are also very good.</li>
    <li> The handle is weak. I don&#x27;t think it will last very long. I have a bull dog handle waiting for when the original handle fails. The shave was pretty good considering the price of the razor.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed that this razor didn&#x27;t twist open with those shuttle bay door type wings you typically see on safety razors. The blades that came with this were not Lord and were OK. When I switched to my 100 pack of Lord blades, bought separately, that&#x27;s when this baby really started to shine. I shave in the shower with a continuous flow of water and can cover the same area 20-30 times without razor burn. I&#x27;m getting the closest and best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten, including those vibrating, multi-blade units that cost $4 per cartridge. I will shave for a year for the same cost as two weeks of Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that my shaves take longer than with multi-blade razors, but it&#x27;s worth it for both cost and shave results.</li>
    <li> The first razor I got was defective but the seller sent a replacement right away and I&#x27;ve had no problems with the second razor at all. Nice beginners razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is very light...aluminum?  pot metal?  THe finish is substandard.  Its only redeeming feature, the reason I purchased it, is the supposed interchangeability of the head with Merkur razors.  (My Merkur head is damaged).  But it actually isn&#x27;t interchangeable, at least not on mine.  The additional razors are taped so excessively to the package that I had to destroy the packaging to open it... making it non-returnable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another one of life&#x27;s lessons, I suppose.</li>
    <li> Works well and is good value for the price.  The aluminum handle feels a little cheap (it&#x27;s light), but I have no reason to upgrade to a more expensive razor.  This one works fine.</li>
    <li> Still going strong after 1 year. I highly recommend this razor. I have saved so much money and get a better shave.</li>
    <li> Light weigh, well balanced, longer handle fits my hand better than standard DE Razors.  One of the better razors that I own and use.</li>
    <li> Overall, this razor is good quality for the price. I got interested in double edge safety razors for the savings on the actual razor blades compared to cartridges, the quality of the shave, and the idea of taking more time to have a more enjoyable shaving experience. This razor has been good for a beginner like me because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be too aggressive, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking it since it doesn&#x27;t cost much.&lt;br /&gt;One point to be made is the quality of the included &amp;#34;Lord&amp;#34; brand razor blade. It seemed to have lost its sharpness after only about 2 shaves, and I wasn&#x27;t getting the closest shaves. I switched it out for one of the other Blue Bird razor blades and I have had no problems since.&lt;br /&gt;The actual razor handle seems to be made of aluminum, and it has a pretty good texture that lends to good grip. The head of the razor seems to be steel so it is definitely top-heavy, which I would probably prefer a more balanced razor but that&#x27;s a small gripe.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is great for anyone who isn&#x27;t sure if shaving with a double edge razor is their thing, or if they just want a way to shave a couple dollars off of their monthly expenses.</li>
    <li> The handle looks to be machined aluminum, and is very nice. The head is of lower quality, die-cast and chrome plated, and could be slightly brittle. (It&#x27;s best not to drop it.) Overall if functions well, weighs nicely, and is easy to shave with. Very good for the money. Easily better than the cartridge razors at the drug store.</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s not a $40 Merkur.  Who cares?  It&#x27;s heavy, the head screws on nice and tight, it&#x27;s evenly balanced, and the razors that come with it are quite passable.  A nice shave, and very hard to beat for the price.</li>
    <li> Got this yesterday. Tried for the first time today. Great first shave. Close shave with no nicks or cuts. No razor burn. Used the Lord blade that came with the razor. Design looks good and solid. Holds the blade nicely and evenly. Not too much blade sticking out. Beard and shave soap washes out nicely also. Great razor for the price and great for a newbie getting into double edge blade shaving for the first time.</li>
    <li> This razor is perfectly fine and works well.  Over the time I&#x27;ve used it, I started to wonder if I wouldn&#x27;t prefer something with a slightly longer handle, but I&#x27;ve had zero problems with this one.  I found that my local Walmart sells razor blades branded as Wilkinson Sword, and they seem to last the longest for me.  If you&#x27;re just starting to use this kind of razor, you definitely need to test out a few different brands of blades, and then take the time to get used to the razor.  Unlike plastic safety razors, this old style of razor takes a little while to train your hand on how to get the closest shave because it depends on slight changes in the angle of how you hold the razor.  I&#x27;m also convinced that different blades affect this angle--so don&#x27;t go switching blades every other time.  Go ahead and go through a pack of 5 - 10 blades of a particular brand before you switch.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Why have I wasted money for years buying expensive multi-blade cartridge razors?&amp;#34;: four month in, I&#x27;m asking myself that question.  I&#x27;m just an average dude.  I don&#x27;t use a fancy boar-hair brush, or soap- just crap that sprays out of a can that my wife buys on sale.  Still, this thing is light-years better than even the most expensive multi-blade cartridge razors I&#x27;ve used.  Works beautifully.  No nicks, no cuts, no coconuts (well, just threw the latter in there because it rhymes)!  Wet face, gel up, shave, throw on some aftershave...all done and CHEAP!!!!  Did I mention it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
