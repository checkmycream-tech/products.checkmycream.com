### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent.  </li>
      <li>Color turned out with great dimension and saturation.</li>
      <li>Superior Preference Mousse Absolue is embedded in my scalp.</li>
      <li>Coverage was good and even, though.  </li>
      <li>I loved the mousse application.</li>
      <li>This was anything but Superior.</li>
      <li>I broke my own rule and did not read reviews before purchasing this product.</li>
      <li>(the foam should be a very light copper color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>More of a black-cherry color.</li>
      <li>the chemical scent in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;-the leftover for touching up that advertising claims?</li>
      <li>I used the 4$ Revlon box throughout college and got more satisfying results.</li>
      <li>Make sure you rub it in all over.  </li>
      <li>last batch worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>Coverage on non-grey was okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring at home for many years &amp; L&#x27;oreal has been my favorite product until now.</li>
      <li>DO NOT, DO NOT DO NOT waste $15.00 on this product !!!!!!!</li>
      <li>First, I have used Loreal Preference or Excellence for years with good results</li>
      <li>So, if you want a hair-color that is easy to apply, but looks like something even a truck-stop stripper would find tacky, this is your product.</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply, it came out like mousse</li>
      <li>the plus side, application was easy.</li>
      <li>The product went on easily and there was no odor.</li>
      <li>It worked fine after that</li>
      <li>I tried this last year and was happy with how easy it was to apply.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, this brings me to the color of the dye, which was anything but light.  </li>
      <li>Or, I should say, none of the many colors on my head right now are close to auburn.</li>
      <li>This worked pretty well for me, and I love the color (used 654 - light auburn brown on my med brown hair).</li>
      <li>I have short hair and thought how wonderful it would be able to apply another application later.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve dyed my own hair, but it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve had</li>
      <li>I added more to roots since it didn&#x27;t look like much was happening, then put it on the rest of my hair.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy that I can retouch more regularly, now that I don&#x27;t have to use a whole box each time.</li>
      <li>I used color #900 which is Pure Light Blond</li>
      <li>These bubble/foam dyes are much better than Loreal&#x27;s, and if you don&#x27;t mind the wait (or live close to an Asian market), then they&#x27;re the better choice.</li>
      <li>I can only describe it as Mousey Blond - almost a very, very light brown.</li>
      <li>The gray was covered and stayed covered, no wash out within the first week.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-I used light brown 600, I have natural brown hair.</li>
      <li>Wish I had read the reviews first.  </li>
      <li>My gray was gray after the first shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Cream, so will go back to that.  </li>
      <li>The odor was incredibly strong though, like I had to leave the room multiple times to get a couple of lung fulls of fresh air.</li>
      <li>The color was pretty, took a little darker than most light auburns.</li>
      <li>My grey turned a vivid shade of purple, which isn&#x27;t a good look on a 45 year old.</li>
      <li>Very disapointing.</li>
      <li>When the foam came out white, I took the top off again, rubbed the top of the &#x27;dye&#x27; side, lightly pushed down on it, put the cap back on, and pressed both buttons on the side to make sure it was locked down.  </li>
      <li>I noticed right away that the foam wasn&#x27;t mixed, but rather swirled white and light gold, so I dispensed it into my hand, swirled it around like you would styling mousse, and then applied it.  </li>
      <li>mainly bought this dye because I didn&#x27;t want to wait on a box of Liese or Palty to be shipped overseas.  </li>
      <li>I have short hair and thought it would be great to have half leftover for next time without inventing my own mixing and storing system which I usually have to do.</li>
      <li>My two issues are that it didn&#x27;t cover my grey quite as well as I would have hoped (will work it in to my hairline better next time) and the conditioner didn&#x27;t rinse out very well.  </li>
      <li>After more than 20 years dying my hair I never had any trouble until today - not even when I bleached it twice in a week.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>so I thought I would try their new mousse product.</li>
      <li>BUT... my hair looks exactly the same after rinsing it out.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell what colour the rest of my hair is, but am suspicious that it&#x27;s pretty patchy, as several areas didn&#x27;t appear to take dye.  </li>
      <li>Somehow I now have roots that are several shades lighter than the package colour (roots are auburn now, package was &amp;#34;deep mahogany brown&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>Once the hot water tank refilled, I took another shower, using up all the water again and shampooing it four times with various clarifying shampoos.  </li>
      <li>Basically, everything this hair dye claims is great if you have thin, short, light to dark blonde hair.</li>
      <li>My roots are 1% lighter than my natural hair colour.</li>
      <li>However, my hair looks completely lifeless and the color looks nothing like the box.</li>
      <li>I started from my tips because my roots are naturally thinner and lighter.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t come out as a mousse, no matter how much you shake it; it comes out only part mousse and part runny substance.  </li>
      <li>I rinsed for twenty minutes straight, finally applied the conditioner assuming it might help get the rest of it out, and then continued to rinse until the hot water tank ran dry.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping maybe it will be back to normal in some days</li>
      <li>This is a bad product that should never have seen the light of day without a lot more testing.  </li>
      <li>Apparently I have company.  </li>
      <li>Will toss what&#x27;s left and go back to my old brand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been colouring my hair for 20 years, generally at home with occasional trips to the salon, and have never once had an experience this horrendous.  </li>
      <li>I had no difference in color and no grey coverage, just like all the reviews here and elsewhere</li>
      <li>I bought this after reading great reviews and was extremely disappointed in the coverage of grey.</li>

<li> My hair is still tacky, flat, and greasy.  </li>
<li> I only spent approx $10.00 thank goodness.  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t count on it if you have long hair.</li>
<li> It did cover the grey</li>
<li> If anyone is thinking about going with lighter for the season, do NOT use this - complete waste of money.</li>
<li> This product did not work at all, just burns your hair, does not cover grey one bit.</li>
<li> Found it much easier to control than the usual bottles of gel in other home hair color.</li>
<li> I am definitely worth more than this crap!</li>
<li> I Have a company photo shoot in 3 days and will now have to figure something else out because my hair is now too dry to do anything with.</li>
<li> , even the $3 Colorsilk crap is better than this!</li>
<li> In all, a big waste of money.  </li>
<li> A few weeks later I tried the product again in case</li>
<li> , 1st few tries they said they said to try again later.</li>
<li> I had patches of dark brown, patches of a maroonish purple, some dark red and my usual dark blonde.</li>
<li> it says to massage the product into scalp, other products say never to do this.</li>
<li> On the other hand, the reason I can&#x27;t tell what colour the rest of it is stems from the layers and layers of mousse embedded in my hair, refusing to be rinsed out.  </li>
<li> Other roots were shades of orange</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t even cover the very few grays i have even after following all instructions.</li>
<li> and I use DARK BROWN.  </li>
<li> I do this to avoid an upside down ombre.</li>
<li> I still ended up with an upside down ombre.</li>
<li> The color is dull and it did nothing for the reason I was coloring my hair - grey hairs are still visible.</li>
<li> positives are it&#x27;s less messy and less time consuming.</li>
<li> It did nothing to cover the grey, and left my hair smelling bad until I shampooed it the next day.  </li>
<li> But all it is is a waste of time and money.  </li>
<li> Waste of time.</li>
<li> My bangs were a faded green, and they were evenly covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The product was a waste of time and money.  </li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> I wish I could give this negative stars.  </li>
<li> /&gt;The mousse is so thin that it&#x27;s difficult to tell if you have enough on and if it&#x27;s even.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Literally did NOTHING to my hair but make it smell bad. Didn&#x27;t even cover the very few grays i have even after following all instructions. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This worked pretty well for me, and I love the color (used 654 - light auburn brown on my med brown hair). I noticed right away that the foam wasn&#x27;t mixed, but rather swirled white and light gold, so I dispensed it into my hand, swirled it around like you would styling mousse, and then applied it.  Found it much easier to control than the usual bottles of gel in other home hair color. My two issues are that it didn&#x27;t cover my grey quite as well as I would have hoped (will work it in to my hairline better next time) and the conditioner didn&#x27;t rinse out very well.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy that I can retouch more regularly, now that I don&#x27;t have to use a whole box each time.</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all, just burns your hair, does not cover grey one bit. Foam does not change color while on your hair, you can tell its not working. Returning from or refund.</li>
    <li> First, I have used Loreal Preference or Excellence for years with good results so I thought I would try their new mousse product. I used color #900 which is Pure Light Blond and I am VERY unhappy with the results. It did cover the grey but I don&#x27;t have a lot. However, my hair looks completely lifeless and the color looks nothing like the box. I can only describe it as Mousey Blond - almost a very, very light brown. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> If anyone is thinking about going with lighter for the season, do NOT use this - complete waste of money. This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve dyed my own hair, but it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve had an unsatisfied experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-strong chemical smell. The aroma stung my eyes and nose. It lessens after a couple minutes but does not go away.&lt;br /&gt;-weak colour pay off. I started from my tips because my roots are naturally thinner and lighter. I do this to avoid an upside down ombre. I still ended up with an upside down ombre. Roots are lighter, tips are darker.&lt;br /&gt;-I used light brown 600, I have natural brown hair. My roots are 1% lighter than my natural hair colour. Tips unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;-leaves the chemical scent in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;-the leftover for touching up that advertising claims? don&#x27;t count on it if you have long hair. It was barely enough for me and my hair is medium length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only positives are it&#x27;s less messy and less time consuming. And, the antioxidant,  UV filter conditioner leaves my hair glossy and like silk. That&#x27;s probably what I paid 14$ for - the conditioner. I used the 4$ Revlon box throughout college and got more satisfying results. Basically, everything this hair dye claims is great if you have thin, short, light to dark blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Did not change my hair color at all.  Left it on for 40 minutes.  Nothing.</li>
    <li> I tried this last year and was happy with how easy it was to apply. The coverage was horrible. My gray was gray after the first shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last batch worked perfectly. The gray was covered and stayed covered, no wash out within the first week. I will stay with this product if the coverage stays as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that it still is not perfect, I have a skunk stripe and it has only been three weeks since I colored it last.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the grocery store using a coupon.  I only spent approx $10.00 thank goodness.  The product was a waste of time and money.  I have short hair and thought how wonderful it would be able to apply another application later. I rinsed out the dye at the end of 30 minutes and there was no change in color.  I woke up the next day with a headache from the smell of the product.  A few weeks later I tried the product again in case I applied it incorrectly and I achieved the same result or should I say I achieved no result. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> To everyone whose foam didn&#x27;t work: the &#x27;dye&#x27; side of your canister was stuck or you put the cap on wrong.  When the foam came out white, I took the top off again, rubbed the top of the &#x27;dye&#x27; side, lightly pushed down on it, put the cap back on, and pressed both buttons on the side to make sure it was locked down.  It worked fine after that (the foam should be a very light copper color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this brings me to the color of the dye, which was anything but light.  It&#x27;s darker and more-purple than compared to the box, but that could be my fault for dying over bleach-blonde hair, which was a risk I decided to take.  Coverage was good and even, though.  My bangs were a faded green, and they were evenly covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly bought this dye because I didn&#x27;t want to wait on a box of Liese or Palty to be shipped overseas.  These bubble/foam dyes are much better than Loreal&#x27;s, and if you don&#x27;t mind the wait (or live close to an Asian market), then they&#x27;re the better choice.</li>
    <li> Would have rated a zero if that were an option.  This product made my eyes water and burn, then would not rinse out  I had to use clarifying shampoo three times to get it out and my hair has this weird texture now.  L&#x27;Oreal will be sued over this one.  Very disapointing.</li>
    <li> I used the root touch up directions. My hair looks the same as it did yesterday. It was easy to apply, it came out like mousse should, it didn&#x27;t smell at all, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to cover gray. After 20 + minutes I added more to roots since it didn&#x27;t look like much was happening, then put it on the rest of my hair. I&#x27;ve been trying to call L&#x27;Oreal all afternoon, 1st few tries they said they said to try again later. The last time I called they said the operators were in training. I&#x27;ve been coloring at home for many years &amp; L&#x27;oreal has been my favorite product until now. I&#x27;d give it zero if I could.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading great reviews and was extremely disappointed in the coverage of grey. Will toss what&#x27;s left and go back to my old brand. Coverage on non-grey was okay.</li>
    <li> If there were zero stars I would have checked that. I broke my own rule and did not read reviews before purchasing this product. I have short hair and thought it would be great to have half leftover for next time without inventing my own mixing and storing system which I usually have to do. The product went on easily and there was no odor. BUT... my hair looks exactly the same after rinsing it out. I had no difference in color and no grey coverage, just like all the reviews here and elsewhere said. I went to the L&#x27;Oreal site hoping to send them and email and all they offer is a call in number.. I have no time for that. DO NOT, DO NOT DO NOT waste $15.00 on this product !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Waste of time. Application of mousse is awkward, you have to hold the can upright which means that you have to tilt your head to apply it. As if this job wasn&#x27;t enough of a task. it says to massage the product into scalp, other products say never to do this. What happens in this case is the product is diluted and the disturbance appears to dissipate development of the color. I used an entire can on root touch up and it was a mess and very unsatisfactory on grey coverage. The area around my face stayed white.  Other roots were shades of orange and I use DARK BROWN.  I did not buy this on amazon but came here to see if I did something wrong. Apparently I have company.  Way too expensive as well. I do not know who this product would benefit.</li>
    <li> This is a bad product that should never have seen the light of day without a lot more testing.  It doesn&#x27;t come out as a mousse, no matter how much you shake it; it comes out only part mousse and part runny substance.  It did nothing to cover the grey, and left my hair smelling bad until I shampooed it the next day.  In all, a big waste of money.  I love L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Cream, so will go back to that.  I&#x27;m really sorry I bothered to try this.  L&#x27;Oreal should take it off the market.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Make sure you rub it in all over.  Use a disposable cap and leave in longer to cover all gray</li>
    <li> i want to give it NEGATIVE stars! It SUCKS!!! The coverage is horrible and  i nearly passed out from the fumes! even with the bathroom door open and the fan on! i have never had a haircolor that was so lousy , even the $3 Colorsilk crap is better than this!</li>
    <li> Turned me into a calico. I had patches of dark brown, patches of a maroonish purple, some dark red and my usual dark blonde. My grey turned a vivid shade of purple, which isn&#x27;t a good look on a 45 year old. Went over like a lead balloon at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mousse is so thin that it&#x27;s difficult to tell if you have enough on and if it&#x27;s even. I used the entire package on my medium hair, then combed it through and still have patches where it didn&#x27;t seem to be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color isn&#x27;t even close to auburn. Or, I should say, none of the many colors on my head right now are close to auburn. More of a black-cherry color. NOT what I wanted. Waste of money. Very poor product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, application was easy. So, if you want a hair-color that is easy to apply, but looks like something even a truck-stop stripper would find tacky, this is your product.</li>
    <li> This was anything but Superior. The color is dull and it did nothing for the reason I was coloring my hair - grey hairs are still visible. I Have a company photo shoot in 3 days and will now have to figure something else out because my hair is now too dry to do anything with. I am definitely worth more than this crap! It got a star because that means I hated it.</li>
    <li> The color was pretty, took a little darker than most light auburns. I loved the mousse application. Color turned out with great dimension and saturation. The odor was incredibly strong though, like I had to leave the room multiple times to get a couple of lung fulls of fresh air.</li>
    <li> After more than 20 years dying my hair I never had any trouble until today - not even when I bleached it twice in a week.&lt;br /&gt;Now I just took this mousse out and my hair is thick ad sticky! I&#x27;m hoping maybe it will be back to normal in some days but I&#x27;m scared!</li>
    <li> Worst product ever.  Wish I had read the reviews first.  Took a chance that this might be convenient and reusable,.  But all it is is a waste of time and money.  Does not cover at all.&lt;br /&gt;AVOID at all costs.</li>
    <li> This product does not work!!!!  I used it to color my roots and my hair was the same after I rinsed it out.  Did not even work, my gray hair was still gray.  I was very disappointed.  Going back to using the regular hair color.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this negative stars.  I&#x27;ve been colouring my hair for 20 years, generally at home with occasional trips to the salon, and have never once had an experience this horrendous.  Somehow I now have roots that are several shades lighter than the package colour (roots are auburn now, package was &amp;#34;deep mahogany brown&amp;#34;).  I can&#x27;t tell what colour the rest of my hair is, but am suspicious that it&#x27;s pretty patchy, as several areas didn&#x27;t appear to take dye.  On the other hand, the reason I can&#x27;t tell what colour the rest of it is stems from the layers and layers of mousse embedded in my hair, refusing to be rinsed out.  I rinsed for twenty minutes straight, finally applied the conditioner assuming it might help get the rest of it out, and then continued to rinse until the hot water tank ran dry.  Then I stuck my head under the cold faucet and continued to rinse... and my hair could still be twisted into a sticky rope that stuck straight out from the side of my head.  Once the hot water tank refilled, I took another shower, using up all the water again and shampooing it four times with various clarifying shampoos.  My hair is still tacky, flat, and greasy.  Rage will be forever embedded in my soul as Superior Preference Mousse Absolue is embedded in my scalp.</li>
