<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got the starter kit from Sally&#x27;s to try the Gelish products and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  Once I started to use the Gelish products exclusively, I ordered the Full size kit.  It was a better choice price wise.</li>
    <li> Came in 3 days before time . Everything was in great shape. Been using it and no issues</li>
    <li> This is a great kit! Easy to understand! I had never done gel nails before but just by looking at the bottles you can understand what to do in order!</li>
    <li> Good deal. Cheaper than buying all of these seperatly.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the gloves like it shows in the picture.</li>
    <li> I started out with the Gelish basic kit to see if I liked to system and could even do it at home myself. As soon as I figured out it worked and was entirely possible to do on your own, I was sold.  When my tiny kit was used, I traded up for a bigger size and went for the &amp;#34;full size&amp;#34; kit.  It&#x27;s more expensive, but considering how long my tiny kit lasted, I&#x27;m imagining this will be well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use.  I love the fact that my nails feel stronger and the nail polish lasts for weeks without chipping!</li>
    <li> Great starter set of full size items at a price not much higher than the mini kit! It was well worth it.</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you need and then some to get started with gel nails. The quality of this product is superb.</li>
    <li> This kit is the way to go when starting a Gelish collection.  The price average per product is great.  I have been using this kit for 6 months and have only had to replace the remover and the cleanser, due to my going through them so quickly.  I love the remover. (MUCH more than acetone...works better, smells better and is easier on my skin.) I really like the cleanser, however I replaced it with rubbing alcohol when I ran out. It is much cheaper and works just as well.  I would still recommend this kit to anyone, and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this starter kit it is Full size bottles which is awesome. I suggest people get this kit verse the half size kit.</li>
    <li> Sally Beauty Supply is a rip of when it comes to anything Gelish. My advice is to definitely buy here!</li>
    <li> After only a few times of using the brushes hardened although they sent replacment brushes it was impossible to get them to stay in the lid.</li>
    <li> This pack has everything you need! The pH bond and base coat allows the nail polish to stay on the nail. The top coat gives your nail an incredible shine. The nourishing bottle smells and feels so good! I love it all!</li>
    <li> I just received my kit today and I had to try it. I love it!!! It&#x27;s so easy to do yourself. The cost of the kit plus color is the same amount I would pay for one manicure. Now I can do it all by myself whenever I want in the luxury of my own home. I totally recommend this to any woman who does her nails at a salon.</li>
    <li> Feel like it was a good price for the full Gelish kit.  Handy to receive all the items I needed to do gel nails in one kit.</li>
    <li> EVER SINCE I HAD MY NAILS DONE AT THE SALON WITH GEL.. I HAVE BEEN HOOKED I LIKE THE FACT THAT AFTER I AM DONE APPLYING IT CAN DO ANYTHING.. DISHES, CLEANING ETC..</li>
    <li> Has everything needed to make the nails pretty &amp; even found some really inexpensive accessories to make my nails real pretty</li>
    <li> Great started kit for anyone wanting to do their own gel nails. There were step by step direction on the website on how to apply the product. The first time I used the kit my nails looked great and the color lasted for over 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use.  I am glad I ordered it&lt;br /&gt;as a set.  The instruction were easy to follow.</li>
    <li> This product works just like it does in the salons. It is very easy to use. Follow the directions and it lasts the entire two weeks. The trick is THIN layers!!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product.  It cures well and is very strong.  I am a rock climber, and this gel polish can endure a tough beating.  The only 2 things that took me by surprise was that 1. The Basix kit was sent to me without it&#x27;s packaging.  I was expecting it to come in a box. 2. Because the kit did not come in a box, one of the bottles was leaking.  So I received it a quarter of the way empty.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the brand Gelish, but the gel polish removers lids dont stay tight. The first time it was mailed to me that package was soiled by remover, and then I was sent a replacement which I appreciated, but the lid still doesnt stay on and has spilled every time I take my equipment to do nails for a party-</li>
    <li> Outperforms ibd gel nails. Allowed me to grow out my own nails with minimal damage. Worked well with 36 watt uv light</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit when I purchased the lamp.  It has everything you need except the polish and each one of those is just a little more than I spend on a good quality polish.  I used it this morning and I can say it was not difficult.  It does not come with instructions which would be very helpful so I took a star off because of that.  There is one review that was helpful and I printed it out and used it and my nails came out looking just fine.  It will take one or two times to get it exactly right and I would suggest buying a polish with some color.  The one I chose is very bland and it really didn&#x27;t show me when I had put too much on and it went into the side of one nail a bit too much.  All in all it is an easy product to use once you get the instructions and the result is just as good as if I went to the salon and paid much more.  It will only take four applications to make back the money on this kit, the polish and the lamp so I think it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> It the FULL SIZED basic kit that includes everything you need, except the color polish, to have the perfect gel polish!&lt;br /&gt;Great price for full sized, considering the price for the MINI basic kit - amazon has them for about $35 and stores usually sell them for $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND, you won&#x27;t be able to find FULL SIZED Gelish polish because stores will usually sell MINI...due to the fact that these are for \\&quot;pros\\&quot; only.&lt;br /&gt;Soooo buy it!! Its probably the best price for a full sized Gelish kit that you will find.</li>
    <li> Im so glad i got this kit! Its perfect. Its a great bargain. The bottles are FULL SIZED. The only downfall is that the bottle for the remover doesn&#x27;t close correctly and the liquid leaks out if bottle is not upright. I may have to put it in a different container... Other than that, im EXTREMELY satisfied with the purchase :)</li>
    <li> I love the Gelish sets. They really work great for long lasting manicures and are much less expensive than CND.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! just started doing my nails at home and it works great.  I originaly picked this product because this is waht my salon uses.  Now I can do my own nails - instead of paying them $40.</li>
    <li> The Gelish polish system is the best. I can easily do my nails at home. They have grown out nicely. The gel polish is great because it adds enough protection to your nails so they don&#x27;t chip &amp; break easily but it&#x27;s also not so strong that when you hit your nails hard (like acrylics your finger nail rips from your nail bed &amp; we all know how much that hurts) The nail does break 1st before you&#x27;re in pain.</li>
    <li> I bought the gelish kit after using sensationail a few times, hoping it would work better, and it did. I painted my nails 2 weeks ago with the gelish kit and they still look amazing! I used the LED light that came with the sensationail kit instead of the UV and it worked just fine!  The bottles are full size which is great!  I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I tried the travel size first and really liked it.  I was a nail tech years ago and it&#x27;s going to take some practice with the nail polish to get both hands looking the way I like.  I figure after 10 full sets (like in the classroom), I&#x27;ll be pretty good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember the gel does not harden with each application so be careful when moving your hands around.  I find that completing one hand first then the other is the best route to go.</li>
    <li> Love the gelish products!  Professional nails done at home.  Who could ask for more.  Thank you gelish!&lt;br /&gt;Would order anytime.</li>
    <li> I really liked how easy it they are to use and that it lasts weeks. I have extremely weak nails and a healthy coat of both the foundation and top coat protects my nails from ripping past the nail bed!</li>
    <li> I started with the mini kit to try it out...I have since become addicted to the gelish products. I have tried a couple others and still come back to Gelish. They have a large variety of colors in their polish and I have really good luck with the gels. Gelish cures nicely and quickly and if it weren&#x27;t for the grow-out because of my quick growing nails...I could probably get a good 3 weeks out of it, but only about 7-10 days because of the grow out. Lasts well, no chipping or peeling &amp; looks great the entire time. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> satisfied with my purchase! Wish it came sooner</li>
    <li> works well, stays on nails for approx 7-10days which is better than regular polish...I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. I received it promptly and we loved the products.  Thanks for the great service.</li>
    <li> These go on the same at home just like at the salon. In fact, this is the exact brand my salon uses! The initial cost is a bit for this, polish and drying lamp unit but it will pay you back in 2 months time.  (I spent approx. $130 total for this kit plus some polish and lamp)  Just remember to wipe any product off your skin/cuticle before you stick under lamp.  This stuff is amazing; nice looking for 2 to 3 weeks; easy removal (DO NOT PICK this off; use acetone soak!! or you will ruin your natural nails) and there are literally tons of tutorials for use and even for broken/cracked nail repair online.  Just go to youtube and type Gelish Nails... you will find out just how very simple it is.</li>
    <li> this product is works great, only problem I had was the soak off remover wasted in the box. and it took a little over a week to deliver....</li>
    <li> the set was great - it had everything I needed.  However the polish is very hard to remove and I go through much more of the remover  - I sugest having a larger sized bottle of the remover.</li>
    <li> This are the smaller bottles, but they work fine for those just starting to do their own gel nails.  Later, I started buying the full sizes separately.</li>
    <li> Way better value than the set of minis. The product shipped quickly and was a great price compare to other beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> My daughter was paying $30.00 every other week in a salon to have her nails done. With the purchase of the GELISH Basix kit and the UV lamp she can do it at home for a fraction of the cost. She really enjoyed this Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> For the price I was so happy to have gotten the full sized bottles of the Foundation ...Top It Off ... PH... and finishing oil..  but the one bad thing was when I got the package my bottle of nail cleanser had leaked and a good portion of the bottle was gone...  but no big deal since it&#x27;s really nothing more then alcohol that I can pick up at the market...  but I received the package within just a couple days so there was super fast shipping..</li>
    <li> I ordered this product just the other day. It came in the mail today and I was super excited to try it! The directions were very easy to follow and the only thing I would change would be the print on the bottles. It was kind of small and I had to turn the bottle just right to be able to see it. Super easy...gently buff nails, apply ph, base coat, color x 2, top coat and put under uv light after each application (except ph) and you have beautiful nails that will last 2-3 weeks depending on wear. I am so glad I finally decided to buy it. It is an investment but well worth it!</li>
    <li> I love my gelish kit!! I save so much money now that I can do them at home and I love the way they look and last for weeks!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent starter kit.  Lets you try before getting in too deep.  Instructions are good.  The product works without any hassle.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of this basic kit!</li>
    <li> Love the product but in this kit the base coat &amp; the top coat were too thick to use - attempted return &amp; got NO response!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product because it has all the essentials that you need to do a complete UV gel manicure. All you need is the UV lamp. I have used this product a few times since ordering it and I love the end result. I would also recommend using gel nails instead of acrylic; gel has the same look and strength but doesn&#x27;t ruin the surface of your nail.</li>
    <li> love it, exactly what i wanted and its full sized bottles! If you buy this product at sallys its nearly bout 35-40 bucks for a STARTER KIT... yea this beats that!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this set of everything I need to do my nails.  It was my first time and it worked better than when I had it done professionally.  I watched several You tube videos before I applied the first time, which was very helpful.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine took me to get a gel mani and I fell in love! I quickly realized that with a bit of effort I could do it at home so i bought this kit. I am a licensed esthetician and I can buy this product at a professional beauty supply not open to the public BUT the price is surprisingly WAY more expensive there. I have done over 10 manis on friends and myself so far and everybody loves Gelish. My collection is expanding rapidly, 15 colors so far!</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  The only downfall is that it did not come with instructions.  However, instructions can be easily found on the Gelish nail polish website.  I used this system with an LED curing light and got fantastic results.  I will be purchasing this item again!</li>
    <li> These items works just as well or better than the salons.  No problems with chipping, peeling or breaking nails.  Hint, wear gloves when cleaning and washing dishes.</li>
    <li> My mother started doing her own nails at home and got me hooked as well. So much cheaper than getting them done at the salon. This kit is perfect for just starting out as it has everything you need, minus the light and colors of your choice!</li>
    <li> Great kit. Been using it for over a year now, and love everything about it. Base and top coat are classics by now. Nail cleaner and ph bond are pretty nice too. My least favorite item is gel remover- seems harsh somehow, I prefer acetone. The cuticle oil is great- smells soooo good. Basically that&#x27;s all you need for gel manicure, just get some colors (this kit works well with such brands and EZFlow, ibd, Red Carpet, sensationail, and, clearly, Gelish) and a lamp (I use sensationail LED- works like a charm). This all lasts for a looong time too. Full size is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I love gelish, since I discovered it its the only nail polish I use. I bought the whole system from amazon, and do it myself at home. When for a reason Im in a hurry and just do my nails with a normal nail polish, I regret it at day 2 because it stars to break or look ugly. With gelish my manicure lasts looking great for 2 whole weeks. I love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably need to use the system 2 or 3 times before you master the technique, but its so worthed.</li>
    <li> Love it !! Arrived fast and everything in tact !</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d my packaged earlier than expected and when I rec&#x27;d it I had rec&#x27;d the 8oz bottles of two of the prodcuts with a note that basically, they were sending them just because!  I was suppose to receive the 4oz bottles with this kit.  Loving it so far if only I can learn to put on evenly I&#x27;ll be okay.  I have to keep trying but the product itself is nice! Much better than my first attempt at buying a gel kit of a different brand and it was horrible! I&#x27;ll be sticking with gelish once I see how long it lasts..</li>
    <li> I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be purchasing things separately from now on, not because this kit is bad but because I&#x27;m using them up at uneven levels. Good quality product though :)</li>
    <li> I used this product and I wanted to love it but I just couldn&#x27;t... It&#x27;s something about the technique that I have not been able to master. The paint usually chips within a few days and I really don&#x27;t want to expose myself to the UV rays to fix it. A manicure usually last two weeks for me.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time last night, looks just like I&#x27;ve been at the salon!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t try this sooner, but I was so skeptical that I couldn&#x27;t do it. It would&#x27;ve helped if the instructions came with this full set. But that didn&#x27;t bother me as much as there is alot of YouTube videos on regular people like us doing it all the time. Combined with the company themselves having a video for their line up of polishes. Love it... Will be ordering more as my stock gets down in the future. By the way this is very easy to use, just keep in mind you will still need these items to start doing the right away. A UV/LED Nail Lamp, Wooden Nail File (To Shape), 180 Nail File (to Buff), 91% or higher Alcohol to clean your brush, Sanitizer spray (If you want) to sanitize everything before &amp; during, also lint free nail pad/wipes (DON&#x27;T get the cotton ones as it was kind of irritating to use it and have to be very careful that I don&#x27;t cure any cotton lint.. ) Well hope that helps.</li>
    <li> The products were fantastic. My friend ordered the same products only the minis prior to my ordering these and I love the larger sizes. The only issue I had was the acetone leaked out some and damaged the labels on some of the bottles. Just some cosmetic damage and a little lose of product. But overall, the products are great.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, I advise!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to start doing gel nails at home to save money.  This product came within three days of me ordering it.  It has everything you need to get started besides the UV light and a color gel nail polish, which i also purchased from Amazon!(54 WATT ROYAL NAILS PROFESSIONAL UV LIGHT GEL &amp; Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish Bella&#x27;s Vampire )  :)  Very satisfied, my nails turned out great!!</li>
