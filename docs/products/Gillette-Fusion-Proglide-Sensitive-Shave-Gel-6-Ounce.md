<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I spoke to my wife about my free samples of Gillette Fusion products which was both the razor with FlexBall and the 2 in 1 Gel from Gillette/BzzAgent. My wife thinks I have way to many &amp;#34;products&amp;#34; as a guy and she wanted to know why I need all this stuff, especially a new razor. I told her that actually the Fusion 2 in 1 actually replaces 3 items (guess I didn&#x27;t help my cause lol) my pre shave lotion, my shaving soap and my post shaving lotion and it does a good if not great job at all 3 and I had her feel my face after my shave to show her the job that it did.. She was impressed.... No for why do I need a new Razor? The true answer was I didn&#x27;t, I have the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power and I was hopeing to tell my wife that with the new FlexBall it put my old one to shame and so far I have to honestly say it didn&#x27;t.... The new FlexBall claims to keep my blades sharper longer, which I haven&#x27;t used enough yet to prove, but if it&#x27;s telling the truth saving money is always a WIN WIN conversation with my wife but until I can prove that claim she won that round .... So to recap, my wife was won over by the fact that the Gel could replace 3 items that are currently in our shower, also by how smooth and hydrated my face was, but she didn&#x27;t see any difference in my shave with the addition of the Flexball but jury is still out if it keeps my blades sharper for longer which would save on expensive refills....</li>
    <li> I got to try it for free thanks to Gillette.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  Just a tiny dollop in the palm of my hand spreads easily and  allows the blade to glide smoothly across my face, giving me a nice, close shave with no nicks.  I&#x27;ve been using a generic shaving cream lately - just trying to save a little bit of money.  It is not worth it - even if I do save money.  I go through a can of the cheap stuff every week.  It doesn&#x27;t go very far.  I slice my face up so much that I&#x27;d begun to hate shaving at all.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel has made my wife very happy.  She absolutely hates when I refuse to shave.  I&#x27;ve shaved every day this week and will continue to do so as long as my wife keeps buying Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel (she says she will!).  I&#x27;m very glad I tried it - well worth the price for a happy wife!</li>
    <li> Gillette was kind enough to send me a free sample of their Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel to check out and review... so here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Shave Gel for about two weeks and absolutely love it. I have extra sensitive skin and seem to get razor burn quite often, but so far have had no issues with this product. This has to be the biggest sell for me because razor burn sucks! I have tried a variety of products on the market so this is a big sell for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging itself has added bonus features. First off, the no-mess dispenser locks in place which completely stops gel from oozing out in-between shaves. My wife and I have a shower caddy that is overloaded with product... can we guess who fills it up? Well, this awesome feature protects the shampoo and conditioner bottles from the ooze and makes cleaning the shower much easier. Speaking of easy cleanup, the bottom of this product is plastic, so no more rust stains! After using the product for only two weeks, I wouldn&#x27;t expect there to be rust yet, but just saying...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the gel has an easy to read gage that tells you exactly how much you have left. No more guessing and running out the morning of an important meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in, this product has definite potential and I am excited to continue using it. This is definitely one to buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I have the unwelcome combination of tough facial hair and sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m willing to try anything marketed as &amp;#34;sensitive.&amp;#34; After a few uses I would say that this stuff delivers in that department, and it&#x27;s helped with a good, close shave too. The top is a little gimmicky but it does seem to help cut down on waste &amp; mess. In the interest of full disclosure I received the product as part of a promotion from Gillette specifically to try it out, and I&#x27;m glad I did because it was totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel through a free promo with BzzAgent.com. I figured I would set aside my normal Fusion Proglide Clear Shave Gel to try out this new product. I really enjoy the packaging as the can has a textured feel and won&#x27;t slip out of the hand when using and the twist-top and push style dispense method is extremely easy to use. The gel lathers up extremely quickly on the face and has a cooling feel after being on my skin for about a minute. It was very refreshing! The blue colored foam quickly fades to white, however, after 2 to 3 minutes as if it&#x27;s drying up and you&#x27;re running out of time to shave. It left my skin feeling smooth and clean and I didn&#x27;t experience razor burn. I also tried this with shave gel with my Panasonic electric shaver and didn&#x27;t get quite the same experience as I do with the Clear Shave Gel that I normally use. I had several hairs that were longer than the others and it required that I go over the same area several times to get the even trimmed shave. Not a big deal but this was the only thing holding back my review from a 5-star.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin.  I have been using a competitor&#x27;s product that has always worked ok for me, but it was great. Their product has a cooling sensation that was tremendously soothing.  The product lathered up very well. The can is great as it is not made out of metal so no rust and the twist cap stops the extra gel building up.   I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> Finally found the ONE!  After receiving a free promotional Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensative Shave Gel thanks to Gillette, I now have the right shaving product for my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous other gels and creams claiming to be made for sensitive skin, only to be disappointed in the result.  Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensative Shave Gel feels wonderfully cool and leaves my skin moisturized afterwards.  I found the one and am sticking with it!</li>
    <li> I had very high expectations for this product when given the opportunity to try it for free thanks to Gillette. While the gel gauge and the ability to rotate the head/keep it clean, I did not experience any difference between this shaving gel and others I&#x27;ve tried for sensitivity. I&#x27;ve tried it for several weeks now and have not seen any major difference. That said, the can is definitely rust-free and I&#x27;ve enjoyed having the gauge. The basic highlights of the product are nice but the sensitivity doesn&#x27;t cut it. At the end of the day, Gillette is delivering what they promise: no rust, no guessing and no mess.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel product for free thanks to Gillette and BzzAgent as part of a promotion. I was happy to be chosen for this product because I shave almost every day and like to try out new products to see what is best for me and my skin. I really liked the Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel first of all because it&#x27;s a gel product. I prefer a gel shaving cream to a foam. Secondly it went on nicely and I was able to spread it easily with my shaving cream brush. Third is it did not irritate my face.I was able to get a close clean shave.I recommend the Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel in Alpine Clean.  Made my skin feel very soft and gave me a smooth shave.  The scent was a little strong for me, but it made my skin feel nice.</li>
    <li> I received this shave gel as a promotion from the Gillette company. I got to admit when I received the shave gel I was skeptical it was gonna be any better than my usual gel. I used the first day I got the gel in the mail and it is amazing. I don&#x27;t have bad sensitive skin but when I shave my skin does get dry. The new Gillette fusion gel keeps my skin moist and completely protects from any kind of razor. After shaving with the Gillette fusion gel I cannot feel any discomfort on my skin from the shave. That&#x27;s something that my old gel failed to do. I am now a believer and would highly recommend the gel and anybody with normal to sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> We all are always looking for great deals right?  Ill tell you about the great deal but first you may want to know some other factors that are a POSITIVE.  Thank goodness for the FREE new bottle that I got from GILLETTE.  I especially am thankful for the twist and lock feature on top, no more caps to worry about or if your throwing the bottle in your gym bag or suitcase, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the cap falling off which would lead to a mess.  The new rust free bottling ensures your bottle to look new &amp; fresh.  Many of you wont notice but there is a Gel Gauge on the side to show how much you have left, this will help you be more organized when preparing your grocery list.  So I am a huge fan of my razor, I love my Power Fusion Proglide.  Since it does a great job, I could use any old shaving gel....WRONG.  See i started using this product a bit before.  I just happen to be at my local 99 cents &amp; more store where they had this shaving gel.  NO, I did NOT get it for 99 cents but it was a great deal and you may want to check your local store to see if they may it but remember all products vary from store to store.  Being that its summer and warm, after using this shaving gel i immediately felt a cooling and refreshing feel which benefits your skin and getting a much closer shave.  How do i know its a closer shave? Well usually by 5 or 6 in the evening i could feel the stub back on my face but with this shaving gel i don&#x27;t experience it as much.  You&#x27;ll feel the smoothness of your shave and the smoothness of your skin.  No i am not going to show you pictures, it wont do justice.  You will just have to experience it yourself.  You will need to use both the shaving gel and the razor to know what im talking about.  When you do it, its going to be like someone saying in the back ground, &amp;#34;I told you so.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Got a can to try from Bzzagent.com. Pretty good stuff compared to the other shave creams out there today; almost as good as the cup soap and brush I used to use way back in my younger days. Smells pretty good, and I really like that the can shows you how much is left. I&#x27;llprobably buy this when the free can runs out.</li>
    <li> Before we get to the actual shaving cream, lets talk about how fantastic this can is. There is no more rusting so I don&#x27;t get those random rust flakes on me when I pick up my shaving cream. The nozzle where you press to get the shaving cream to come out is nice too simply because it doesn&#x27;t jam if you&#x27;re messy and get shaving cream on it. The actual shaving cream smells extremely nice and lathers really well. I can tell the difference from the store brand that I get because this feels lighter but helps get that clean shave while keeping my skin moisturized.I will be purchasing this product once the FREE one the Gillette bzz campaign gave me runs out!!</li>
    <li> I received the Ocean Breeze Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel and I love it!! First off, to open the can all you have to do is spin the top which I really like. It&#x27;s a little thing but it sets it apart from all the other shaving gels. The scent is light but pleasant and my wife loves it. I only shave about twice a week with shaving cream (the other days I shave with my electric razor) but the past couple of times I&#x27;ve used this new Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel and have to say that I&#x27;m hooked. My skin is smooth, it gave me a super close shave, and even though I sweat a ton from working outside as a lineman my face is still hydrated at the end of the day. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free from Gillette in return for my honest opinion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various different shaving cream products over the years, typically settling on the tried but true classic foamy type from barbasol.  My skin is fairly sensitive so I usually always pick up the sensitive skin version.  I received a free trial version of this product to review in the Alpine clean scent.  I was a little hesitant at first to try it given the added scents or dye&#x27;s they put in these products usually negate the sensitive skin claims.  After giving it a shot for a few weeks though I have to say that this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used in terms of skin irritation.  I had much less irritation afterward and the 2 in 1 skin care feature left my skin feeling smoother and cleaner feeling than using the barbasol cream with the sensitive nivea after shave balm I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The Gilette fusion gel was easier to use (you only need a nickel sized amount that foams up as you lather it on your face) vs the typical palm full of regular cream.&lt;br /&gt;The Gilette gel has a slight tingling sensation after applying to your face similar to how most aftershave balms feel, I felt it was a nice sensation and it didn&#x27;t cause my skin to get irritated.&lt;br /&gt;NO RUST! my old shaving cream cans had rust around the edges after only a few uses, the Gilette is all plastic so there&#x27;s nowhere to rust.  This was my biggest complaint about my old shave cream as it made me worry about getting rust in the shaving cream and then contaminating a cut from my razor.&lt;br /&gt;2in1 design saves time applying aftershave and saves the cost of buying the extra product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It seems like the bottle only comes half full by design.  The bottom half seems like it&#x27;s either false or maybe contains the propellant to push the gel out.  I haven&#x27;t finished the bottle yet, but I&#x27;m expecting to get about half as many shaves as I did out of a typical shaving cream bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about twice the price of the regular shaving cream, but I don&#x27;t have to buy aftershave now which helps offset the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product, the Pro&#x27;s definitely outweigh the cons in my circumstances.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it because I&#x27;d tried their non-sensitive gel in the past and found it to irritate my skin and clog my razor too quickly.  This new design with the sensitive skin formula fixed both those issues.  Wish they made a travel size bottle of this so I could take it with me on vacation!</li>
    <li> I shave every other day and I also have a pretty sensitive skin when it comes to shaving so I&#x27;m always on a lookout for products like this that are specifically meant for sensitive skin. This shave gel is meant to be used along with the Fusion Proglide which I already own since it does a close and clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;First I sprinkled water all over my stubble and then added the gel. The gel itself is dark blue in color and it lathered up good and covered the whole area quickly. I let it sit for about 2 minutes before shaving. Got all my stubble shaved without any tugs or pulls and most importantly I didn&#x27;t have any irritation or redness. The shaving gel leaves a nice after shave scent on your skin which I think is really nice. My skin was soft and smooth and my wife especially loved it.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the bottle is made to be rust free that alone makes me a loyal buyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
    <li> A good shave gel, no complaints.  I usually use Gillette shave products, and received this for free as a promotion to try out from the brand.  I was actually impressed with the cap/top, love that you can twist is &#x27;closed&#x27; to stop the small stream of extra gel that tends to leak out the opening after you&#x27;ve used it.  The product itself was good as well:  nice thick lather, pleasant fragrance, felt good on my skin.  Overall a favorable experience, no reason not to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Didnt leave my skin rough or have any type of razor bumps. I was able to try this product for free through bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I was provided a can of the Alpine Clean gel free, thanks to Gillette, to provide a review. I normally use either a foam or soap and brush but I figured why not. I must say, I have been pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can is plastic, so it won&#x27;t leave a rust stain on the counter. It also has a window on the side to show how much product is left. This is nice, so you don&#x27;t run out before knowing it. In addition, the cap rotates, which leaves the side of the can clean instead of having gel or foam dribble down the side. It may only add up to one more shave per can, but it is a savings when your gel isn&#x27;t oozing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is sharp and crisp. I don&#x27;t normally use heavily scented products, but this one is nice. It also leaves my face feeling tingly afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is comparable to most other products. The gel foams up when applied to the skin, so you don&#x27;t need to use a hand-full to get a nice lather. And again, it leaves my face feeling tingly, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is supposed to be for sensitive skin, and I feel they didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I still had razor burn. My face is smooth, though, and with application of my post-shave cream it feels better than some other products I&#x27;ve used. So in all, not bad. If you&#x27;re a gel user I would recommend it. Even if you&#x27;re a foam user I would recommend it, at least to try.</li>
    <li> So I received a free can oof Gillette Sensitive Shave Gel to try and I&#x27;m glad I had the opportunity to try it! While I had been a Gillette buyer before I had moved to another brand because I didn&#x27;t like how shaving gel or cream would come out of the can after I used it. (it just created a mess) When I tried Gillette&#x27;s new Fusion Proglide, I honestly thought it would be the same but I was pleasantly surprised. The can has some nozzle that stops the overflow or the little extra of shaving cream from coming out and making a mess. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a promotion from Gillette and I really like it. I have very sensitiveness skin and I am very prone to razor burn. I am usually very choosy about what shaving cream I use and for the last few years I have stuck with one brand. However, I will be switching to Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a while now, I am very happy with it. It helps protect against nicks and cuts, my skin feels great after shaving and no burn!</li>
    <li> I received Gillette Fusion ProGlide Shave Gel to try for free from Bzz agent.  I have been using the same old shave cream for as long as I can remember  so I never really stopped to think if there was anything better out there or not.  I am now switching over to the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide !  I have several scars on my face and have to be careful  when I shave.  I found that this product delivers a very smooth close shave... better than anything I have ever used.  It makes a nice creamy lather and since it has a no rust can, I can leave it in the shower without worrying about it leaving a rust- ring.  Bonus... my wife loves the way it smells.  She asked me if I had changed my after shave and she loves how smooth my face is.  Win win.</li>
    <li> Wow what a difference. I received a sample of this shaving gel from Gillette and it is great. Nice smell to it as well as how smooth it goes on. Also makes the tough areas for me easier, you know upper lip and chin. Great packaging with the easy turn cap, no extra gel lingering and the plastic bottom is the way to go. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try the product for free thanks to Gillette and Bzzagent and found that  I love this product!!  Yeah yeah, the shave gel is awesome.  It allows me a close shave AND keeps my face smooth and hydrated all day.  But the really amazing part is the packaging!!  How is it that no one has done this before?  The bottle is plastic.....which means no rust on the tile from the bottle getting wet!  I like to shave in the shower so this is an amazing thing!!  Also it has an indicator of the level of gel left.  So I know when I need to get more.  No more running out in the middle of shaving, in the shower!!  Awesome job Gillette!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Edge shave gel for sensitive skin for years and decided to give this a try when I re-ordered Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor blades this month.  I&#x27;m not sure how different shave gels can have such different results, but I will never buy this one again.  Even with a brand new razor, I was left with nicks and cuts everywhere and painful razor burn.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with the Edge shave gel and rarely end up with nicks.</li>
    <li> Product was cheaper at amazon and happy it is made of plastic no more rust stains on shower tiles&lt;br /&gt;My local grocery store sells same product for 1.07 more</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for many years. A few years ago I received an electric shaver for Christmas. I have all but forgotten about the luxury that comes from a nice close shave. I am a part of a product testing website called bzzagent.com. This product came up for testing and I jumped at the chance to try and review it! I was happy that it was a brand that I was familiar with. The Gilette Fusion Proglide Gel lives up to 100% of what it says it will achieve. I have not had a closer shave in as long as I can remember. I have sensitive skin that breaks out at the drop of a hat! The sensitive skin formula that Gillette came up with for this product works like a dream. Not a single mark on even the most sensitive spots on my face or neck.&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing that I can praise them for is the lack of a rust ring on my tub! The bottom of the can does not have the exposed aluminum that most aerosol cans do. Over the course of a few weeks most of them start to rust and tarnish a specific spot on your tub or shower that you then have to, eventually, scrub until your arm falls off! This product alleviates that extra chore. That in itself should draw you to purchase this over others!&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell the Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel is leaps and bounds above most all of the products out on the mass market today. Give it a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Used to dry shave, or shave in the shower.  I have fairly sensitive skin so when I started using this product I had very noticeable results.  No longer had any red bumps or skin irritation.  Also cuts almost never happen any more no matter how careless I am with the razor.  My wife has also been using it on her legs instead of soap and says it does a good job for that as well.  We got our first sample as part of a Bzz Kit, free from Gillette.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this product for free to try and to give my honest opinion on the product. I am rather picky when it comes to shaving products because my skin get irrated easily. Not only did this product provide a clean shave I didn&#x27;t get any of my usual redness after shaving and no bumps. It smells amazing and the can design is awesome. No more rust stains on the sink and it shows how much is left in the can. Gillette stepped it up! I will continue to keep using!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Ocean Breeze shave gel for ~2 weeks now.  Used it on a variety of razors from the Fusion to the Dorco 6 to see how it managed with both new and old blades as well as generic vs name brand.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that at first glance I really like the packaging and I dont just mean the looks. Its finally functional!  My single biggest pet peeve has been the mess left on the top of the can after dispensing it.  Let&#x27;s face it, I think most people toss (or lose) the lid after a week.  And yet rinsing the cap after dispensing the gel never stops that oozing.  Inevitably the gel ends up getting on my wife&#x27;s brush or a comb when I throw it back in the drawer.  This new top really delivers on it&#x27;s promises though.&lt;br /&gt;Another neat feature I found is the &#x27;gas&#x27; gauge.  For whatever reason shave cans feel either new and heavy or like they are going to run out on your next shave.  My last can for before using this felt like it had been running on fumes for weeks!  While I haven&#x27;t yet seen the gas gauge in action it is nice to know that when it gets to that level I will have a better idea as to when it will run dry.  Not a must for me but a differentiator.&lt;br /&gt;As for the  shave itself I really like it.  Having used gels, creams and butter like products to shave the gels  are definitely my favorite.  This one had the right amount of fragrance without being overpowering.  It stayed thick after I put it on and didn&#x27;t &#x27;foam&#x27; up like some other gels do and it felt clean after shaving.  I really liked it.  It definitely outperforms the other gels I have although I would call it evolutionary, rather than revolutionary among gels.  It definitely performed the job well and led to a clean, fresh shave and that to me is what really matters.</li>
    <li> It works well with sensitive skin and any type of skin. It smells great and works great. I got no cuts on my skin finally with a shaving cream that actually works, I was not disappointed with this product. It made my face feel soft as well. There is also no cap for the can, so you turn the top of it to open and close the can. So all and all its a simple can and easy to use. You won&#x27;t regret trying this out!</li>
    <li> I recently was given a chance by Gillette to try their Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel + Skin Care through Amazon.com. I never really gave a lot of thought to my shave cream but after trying this product I realize how much I have been missing out.  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel + Skin Care has provided me with an excellent shaving experience every single time I have used it. It is very soothing and refreshing to my skin. My razor glides effortlessly across face with absolutely no irritation. Additionally, I am left a a fresh, lingering scent (I am using the Alpine Clean scent) that is very pleasent. My wife loves it! The dispenser has also been very thoughtfully designed. It has a no rust bottom that is awesome and a level indicator that will let you know when you are nearing the end of the product. I was also surprised at just how little of the gel I needed to use to obtain an adequate shaving coverage. I am looking forward to trying the other scents in the future. I wholeheartedly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received a can of Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel + Skin Care to try from Gillette.  I honestly have to say Gillette has done it again with another great product.  I get a really close, smooth shave and after shaving with Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel, my skin feels soft and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;In addition to a great shave gel, the folks at Gillette have come up with the perfect can.  First off, there is no cap!  You just turn the top of the can to dispense the gel and there is no oozing gel or mess when you close it.  The second feature is the plastic bottom of the can, this may not sound like a big deal, but my wife sure is happy that there are no rust rings on the bathroom vanity anymore since I started using Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel + Skin Care.  Lastly, there is a gauge on the side of the can to let you know how much you’ve used and how much is left in the can.  No more running out when it feels like there’s still some in the can!&lt;br /&gt;Personally, this is my new go to shave gel and I highly recommend trying Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel + Skin Care!</li>
    <li> I received this a part of a promotion from a BzzAgent campaign. The scent was great.  Not too overpowering, but very clean and light (complimented often by my wife after shaving about how &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; I smell - only used this gel).&lt;br /&gt;Application with little water was thick and substantial.  This added extra glide to the shave and overall provided cooling relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 4 stars because after original solo use, I combined it with shave oil and got a dramatically improved shave (absolutely no nicks or cuts).  This wasn&#x27;t attainable with using either product by it self.  I think the combo with a (very low cost) shave oil creates a perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome scent and gel - would recommend using.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I use the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care in combination with a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology that I got for free from BzzAgent. This combination is unbeatable. What I normally do is shower, wash my face, and apply the gel. After that I normally wait about 3 minutes for maximum beard softening and then shave. I notice my shaves are very close and makes my face feels like a baby. With this pairing, I have absolutely no irritation whatsoever. It is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have used this a couple times now and so I think I understand the product.  I Like the gel type shaving cream but don&#x27;t really use it often. I usually purchase the cheapest or most obvious can of shave cream.  I used a quarter sized dollop and found that was almost too much,  It lathers really well and I feel it protects your face quite well.  Unlike some others I did not use a brand new blade, I used the one that has been several rounds with my face already.  Not a nick or scrape shaves smooth and my face feels better after the shave than usual, no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably re-think the shave cream purchases I make in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying the product for free thanks to Gillette if that makes a difference but I am not paid for a good review.</li>
    <li> So, I got this from BzzAgent and Gillette to try out and give Bzzz back regarding how I feel about this product. I like the scent, and it foams up really nice when applied to a wet face. The shaves are smooth and easy, no razor stubble or burn afterwards and it leaves my face feeling really smooth and clean. This is a great product and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> No more rust stains in the shower! I love the new can. Not thrilled with the price. Gillette has always been liberal in raising prices with each iteration of their products.</li>
    <li> I typically change between shaving before I shower and shaving after I shower.  If I shave before I shower, it usually hurts a little bit.  If I shave after the shower, it hurts less, but I end up with hair following me around all day.  I&#x27;ve been using a gel I got from Dollar Shave Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel as a promotional product from the manufacturer for free, so I tried it out.  I&#x27;ve found that I can put it on my face and let it foam up while I&#x27;m doing other things before my morning shower.  A couple of minutes later, shaving doesn&#x27;t hurt!  And then I can take my shower and don&#x27;t have to worry about the tiny hairs everywhere throughout the day.  :-)</li>
    <li> I got the product free through Gillette and BzzAgent. I have tried it a couple times so far. I have the Alpine Clean for sensitive skin. Really refreshing and tingles.Love the smell. I like how it starts as a gel and foams up.No dripping. It gave me a clean smooth shave, with no irritation. The gauge on the side will be helpful so I don&#x27;t have to guess if it is full or not. The can the gel comes in I really like. I have marble counter tops and I hate when they get marked with rust rings. This can doesn&#x27;t allow that since it is plastic on the bottom. The can is easy to grasp. I will most likely purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this to try free. I revived the ocean breeze scent. The shave gel is similar to many that I&#x27;ve tried before. But the design of the can is great. most other cans allow just a bit of foam out after you dispense. this one is clean, quick, and precise.</li>
    <li> I want to tell you about a great shaving product. I received from Gillette a can of Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel to try out for free. First let me tell you I have a tough thick beard. I have to shave every morning and if I go out at night I have to touch up my face because by 4:30 I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  I have been using a shave oil for several years which helps because I also have Sensitive skin. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel has a nice balance of shaving gel and skin cooling gel the Ocean Breeze has a nice clean smell and is cooling and very refreshing. I don&#x27;t have to put on after shave to cool down my face. The plastic bottom keeps the can from leaving a messy rust ring on the tub. The gel goes a long ways so it doesn&#x27;t take much to get the bread softened up. Some of the other features that I like are the clean-dispense actuator that locks in place to prevent post-shave oozing. The new gel gauge lets you know how much you have left, so there’s no guessing when you get close and don&#x27;t run out leaving searching for something to finish up with something that doesn&#x27;t work as well. The only real issue is that I had to figure out how much pressure to apply because it is so smoothing I found that I was pushing to hard an ended up cutting my face up for about the first week until I was able to get it down. I would definitely recommend Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel + Skin Care. All in all I would say the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> Note: I received this product for free from Gillette in return for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: The gel is great. It is the best I&#x27;ve used for smoothness, closeness of shave, protection from nicks, moisturizing and overall. Nice smell. Don&#x27;t have to use much (so it may be a relatively good value, or at least a better value than you would initially calculate). Also, the can is not metal, so you don&#x27;t get the annoying rust stain when you put it on a damp surface. That is an obvious thing, but I&#x27;m glad someone finally did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: I did not like the way the button works or the gel comes out. I didn&#x27;t have any real trouble; it&#x27;s not like a can or jar you can&#x27;t open. But it was just a little bit too much of a squeeze and didn&#x27;t feel very natural. I guess I am not crazy about new ways to dispense products or clever packaging. But this is a minor concern. Maybe I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> I received a can of Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel + Skin Care from the brand, to sample and provide feedback. I&#x27;ve used various Gillette products over the years, and this one nails it. I prefer the gel form as I feel it stiffens the whiskers to stand up while shaving giving me a skin tight shave, but this sensitive version also left my face feeling conditioned, without any burning sensation or skin itching. If you have sensitive skin, and sometimes get a shaving rash like I do, I encourage you to try it. After a few uses my skin also felt smoother (according to my wife) and shaving felt easier as the blades just glide across the skin without &amp;#34;catching&amp;#34; on tough spots. If you think this review was based on getting something free and making them happy, please read my other reviews on different products. To me, if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll tell you, and sometimes bluntly! But this worked, and now my favorite to use going forward.</li>
    <li> I was given the Alpine Clean version of the Gillette ProGlide shaving gel by BzzAgent, through Gillette for free. Shaving with it gives a very refreshing feel. It also has a very pleasant smell to it.  After shaving, I always felt refreshed and my skin felt smooth. Whenever I shaved with it, I never experienced any razor burn. The canister is great, as it doesn&#x27;t leak gel like other ones. Since it&#x27;s made of plastic, I never had to deal with any rust around the sink from it. The gel gauge on the canister is a great idea, and I&#x27;m surprise other canisters don&#x27;t have a similar feature. Compared to other shaving gels I have used, this one definitely ranks up there as one of the best gels I&#x27;ve used. The gel helps give a nice shave and makes your skin feel great afterwards.</li>
    <li> I received this shave gel as a promotion from the Gillette company through BzzAgent  I must admit when first got the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel + Skin Care in Ocean Breeze that I did not expect much since I have used shaving gels/creams from the cheapest drug store brands to the $50 (4oz) high end spa/luxury brand and have never been completely happy with any of them.  The first day I used the gel was impressive. I don&#x27;t have bad sensitive skin but when I shave my skin does get flaky.  The gel keeps my skin moist without the sticky feeling that some moisturizers. The scent is pleasant and not too strong, just clean smelling.  A unique feature is the twist and lock feature on top, this means easier to use and transport.  The Gel Gauge on the side shows how much you have left, which is perfect for managing your supply.  I would highly recommend this product to every man who shaves.</li>
    <li> When I received an email from Gillette asking to try this product for free I was all of it!  I’m a long time user of all Gillette products and this seemed to be just another great product.  As I expected I was correct in my assumption!  The gel is thick, just the way I like it and it smells pleasant.  The can itself is much better than other Gillette gels and creams; no cap is a plus and the window showing the remaining amount is bonus.  I use the Fusion ProGlide Flexball Razor and with this gel I get a real close shave and my skin is baby-butt smooth.  Although being a little on the pricey side you get what you pay for… I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a great shave gel.</li>
    <li> I really liked tgis shave gel. I was cooling and refreshing as I used it. I like that the container is made from plastic to avoid the rust spots in the tub. I like the gauge on the side that tells you when your running low. It was like a tea tree smell as well.</li>
    <li> I have used Edge forever.  I always thought is was the best cream for the price.  I was able to get a free sample of Fusion Shave Gel and now i am sold.  I love the  no mess dispense actuator that locks in place to prevent post-shave oozing&lt;br /&gt;The canister’s plastic bottom means no rust stains, either.  My wife loves this!&lt;br /&gt;The new gel gauge shows just how much you have left, so there’s no guessing.  Now I dont have to use hair conditioner as my shaving lotion:)</li>
    <li> As a typical Barbasol user I have to admit that this is a great addition to the Gillette lineup! I received a free trial version of this product to review in the Alpine clean scent.The gel smells good and works great like all the other Gillette shaving gels that I&#x27;ve ever tried. I really like that there is no cap with this can and that there is a small window that allows you to see how much is left in the can. Both are very smart innovations. The shaving experience I had with this gel was very good. I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin but this gel made my face feel smooth and soft after shaving, bonus in my book. Even though I was given this as a sample, I will be buying more if this stuff when I run out. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this new can . No more rust . Gillette fusion proglide gave me a silky smooth clean shave using my Gillette fusion razor . #GOTITFREE. So happy to be in this buzz campain</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette, I got to try this product for free, but that&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m saying I like it :-) They&#x27;ve added some nice features (particularly to the packaging) that are so simple, but are really nice touches. The first is the locking top. No more cap to keep up with, especially if you&#x27;re like me and have it uncapped most of the time and then have to search for the top when you travel so you don&#x27;t get shaving gel all in your suitcase! I also like that the can is now made of plastic instead of metal. No more rust rings. The final cool packaging addition is a see-through &amp;#34;gauge&amp;#34; on the side so you can see how much gel is left. The gel inside is also nice. GIves you a nice close shave and smooth feeling skin after without feeling too slimy while shaving.</li>
    <li> Ah, Gillette Shave Gel. For a generation of guys, this is the shave gel we used throughout high school and college. But this version of the shave gel has been fancied up with some features and benefits. Let&#x27;s dive into those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a can of the gel from Gillette to try out. After using it for the past three weeks, I&#x27;ve developed some thoughts on the gel. It&#x27;s purported to be a &#x27;2+1&#x27; for sensitive skin and for skin care. I&#x27;m sure it does fine for this, but the tingling that it gives to the face is a bit much. Normally, I&#x27;d use shave soap or shave cream that are a bit more natural that don&#x27;t tingle the face. That said, the shave does get very close and the gel is very thick. So you shouldn&#x27;t need as much. Which brings us to the next feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a gauge for the gel to give you an idea of the content levels. But wouldn&#x27;t using it until it exhausts give the same idea? I recall using gels, you&#x27;ll start to see it empty out a couple of days before it ends. So the gauge is a nice to have, not a must have. A feature that was a must have was the plastic, rust-proof bottom. The rust ring that shave canisters provided before were annoying so it&#x27;s a nice feature of this can that it didn&#x27;t leave this iron oxide remnant behind. Gillette also points out there is a clean up dispenser, but I just thought it was messier than it was trying to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Proglide Shave Gel does what it&#x27;s supposed to, feels good on the face, and has a snazzy packaging, but there are a ton of other options out there to choose from. It&#x27;s just fine.</li>
    <li> This is a very good package that allows me to use the gel without all the leftover mess that usually is around the cap.  I love the plastic can now because like every man with a wife or girlfriend knows they are going to use our shaving in the shower.  Now there is no rust leftover either.  The shaving gel itself was very soothing and gave me a nice shave with a cooling effect.  I will definitely use again (and would pay for as this one was a test product from BZZAgent) and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I had a chance to try this product for free, thanks Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely awesome. I&#x27;ve used Gillette Shaving Gel for a while - it&#x27;s good. This bottle is great - it is made of plastic and won&#x27;t rust, it has level indicator. It is awesome innovation and i&#x27;ll definitely would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Gillette-I&#x27;m a BIG fan...I received this product free, as part of a promotional offer. The new Gillette Fusion Proglide shaving gel is the best shaving gel I&#x27;ve used to date. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now, and it hits all the bullet points, right on the mark. I like the scent of the &amp;#34;Ocean Breeze&amp;#34; gel that I choose. It refreshes me early in the morning. I also really like the coverage and the fact that it delivers on the sensitive claim. The Gillette Fusion Proglide can has a twist, as in a twist top that closes so there is no &amp;#34;drip&amp;#34; at the opening. Now I don&#x27;t have to shower off the can too, every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;The Genius&#x27;s over at Gillette also put a &amp;#34; gel gauge&amp;#34; on the side of the can so I don&#x27;t run out of gel. The no rust can is a nice change...no more &amp;#34;rust&amp;#34; ring on my sink!&lt;br /&gt;Way to go Gillette...thanks for the improvements.</li>
    <li> While most reviewers will probably focus on the Gel itself,however the most impressive parts about this product for me were all on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic construction of the container prevents the almost instant rust that pops up on the bottom of Shaving Cream containers, and the twist top prevents leakage of gel down the front of the can.  Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those two improvements coupled with the fact that the Gel works just fine has lead to me switching brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
    <li> After receiving a free sample of this I am sold. This is the best shave gel I have tried. Smells great and has a nice tingle. And finally they have created a container that will not rust for us shower shavers. I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I am a huge Gillette fan, and purchased 3 cans from Amazon. It is extraordinarily thick and gooey. When it worked the shave was OK, but not great. The first can stopped working with more than 50% left. The second can clogged my sink, and forced us to use Drano. After using Drano for a few days, it clogged again which forced me to throw the other cans in the garbage. Now, my sink works fine without this gooey shaving cream. This is only Gillette product that I ever purchased that is unconditionally terrible and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I got to review this product through Gillette as a promo. I think overall this product lived up to what it stated. It is great for sensative skin and completely gives a cool and refreshing feel. The gel does a good job of becoming a nice foamy lather. And as for shaves go it goes just as close as any other gel I have used. All in all I would recommend this product as long as it is a comparable price to other gels.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave gel from a can and the most innovative shave gel can ever. Gillette sent me a promotional can to put to the test and I was pleasantly surprised at how different this was from any other shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel itself rubs on very thick and rich. Excellent lather that feels awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can is honestly my favorite part though believe it or not. The twist top prevents leaking after every use which used to drive me crazy on other cans of shave gel. The plastic bottom ring doesn&#x27;t rust, which was never a problem for me, but I saw plenty of it in other bathrooms! The window in the can is kinda cool to see how much gel is left, though I guess you could just shake the can to feel how much is left without a window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product that I recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin.  Most gels leave my face burning or irritated after a shave (both after a hot shower or just straight shave).  I was pleasantly surprised this one didn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated.  As a good test, I didn&#x27;t change the blades on my razor to see if there was a difference with a direct switch from my old shaving gel.  You could definitely feel the difference right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spinning cap thing, I don&#x27;t really understand or see the need for.  If you rinse any gel cap after you use the canister, there shouldn&#x27;t be any leftover gel.  I guess it might be good for people that are lazy and don&#x27;t rinse their canisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a disclaimer, I did receive this product to try for free from Gillette if that makes any difference for anyone.</li>
    <li> Gillette does it again! This 2 in 1 shave gel is perfect for home or travel. I happen to travel for work and I hate when the cap comes off of my shave gel and the leakage gets all over my other grooming products in my shave kit. First this has no cap. Instead it had a twisting locking head and there is not leakage either!! I also hate when I am travelling and the dreaded last squirt comes out of my shave gel can. You can never seem to feel when the can is gonna die. Gillette put a level indicator on theirs and you can actually see when you are about to run out!! This should have been done years ago!! The can won&#x27;t rust either which is great. Finally the shave gel itself, it is thick and makes a great lather and it leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed! I am extremely pleased with this product!! I received this product as a free promotion from Gillette but will definitely be a purchaser going forward!!</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Gillette I was able to try out this great can of Fusion ProGlide Shave Gel for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally am picky about any product I put on my face. When it comes to shaving creams I want something that will get me a close shave as well as leave my face feeling great after. Not only does the gel work great but the can design is awesome.I would defiantly buy in the future!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and so far so good with this product.  I am always skeptical about trying a new product but who can say no to a promotion from Gillette.  I&#x27;m having less skin burn with this shaving cream so I am going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I was given a can of Ocean Breeze scent by Gillette to try for free. I have used the gel for over a month now. I shave every day and my beard is not very heavy so I usually use a shave foam but I decided to give gel another try. Gillette has come up with some great improvements in the canister design that I really appreciate. The no-mess valve is excellent! No more oozing the next time I open the medicine cabinet, which drives me crazy. The plastic canister is also great since it is very light weight. Now for the gel itself, I did like the Ocean Breeze scent, which was clean but not too strong at all. The gel did have a cooling effect on my skin, but that is not something I desire. I don&#x27;t usually get much irritation from shaving. My disappointment is that I still need to work the gel into a lather on my face, as I have with other gels I ave tried. This extra work annoys me. I just want to quickly shave and get going. So I am going to stick with foam. But if you like gel this product with it&#x27;s improved packaging is for you!</li>
    <li> I received this shave gel as a promotion from the Gillette company. I got to admit. When I received the shave gel I was skeptical it was gonna be any better than my usual gel. I used the first day I got the gel in the mail and it is amazing. I don&#x27;t have bad sensitive skin but when I shave my skin does get dry. The new Gillette fusion gel keeps my skin moist and completely protects from any kind of razor I use.</li>
    <li> First of all I was asked to try this product for free by Gillette.  I was hesitant to try it because I only use artisan soap or creams.  I havnt tried a gel shaving cream in some time and felt I could give it a try and see if they have improved.  Certainly the look of the can is appealing and the scent is very nice but doesnt last long at all.  Im not big on scent as I am on performance because lets face it thats what matters the most.  I have shaved with this gel 5 times now so I feel that I have a good sense of the performance of this product.  Each time I washed my face prior to shaving to soften the hair up and dispensed about a half dollar size dollop in my hand.  I added a bit of water to work up a lather and applied to my face liberally.  I let it sit on my face for approximately 3 minutes as I changed the blade in my vintage Gillette super speed.  This is basically the same routine I use on an every-other day basis.  I started making my first pass and my razor glided nicely over my face.  Its important to mention that obviously my 60 year old razor does not have that gooey strip on it.  I was about half way through the first pass and i had to add water to the lather on my face as it dried up pretty quickly.  That was a disappointment.  Of course adding water thinned the lather so I had to apply more gel to my face and built it up again.  I finished up with my first pass and went on to my second pass.  The same thing occured where the gel dried to my face.  I dont take an overly long time to shave but it is nice to take my time and get a good first pass.  In conclusion,  I was neither impressed or disappointed.  Of course my expectations were not very high to begin with but it was acceptable for a quick shave and if I am traveling.  The improvements they made with the no rust bottom, the ability to see how full or empty the can is, as well as once you are done dispensing no more gel will come out are all good improvements.  However, in my opinion, you just cant beat the quality and performance of soap and brush lather.</li>
    <li> I love this product,  I usually use the cheap stuff and even though it works, this stuff is worth the little bit extra.  I like the can, everything about it, stays in your hand even when wet, the nozzle no longer leaks out with extra shave cream,  and the new feature of letting you know how much product is left in the can is fantastic, I can&#x27;t believe that this wasn&#x27;t thought of sooner.  The can I used was the &#x27;Ocean Breeze&#x27; scent, had a nice aroma but not a &#x27;girlie&#x27; scent.  I also like to keep my arms shaved and used it for this as well, after the shave my arms felt great, smooth and soft as if there was some kind of lotion in with the gel.  I will definitely use this product from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette for the free can of Fusion ProGlide Shave Gel to try !!!!!</li>
    <li> I rotate between using a Norelco electric razor and my grandfather&#x27;s 1940&#x27;s Gillette SuperSpeed II Double-Edged Safety Razor. The Norelco is obviously quicker but the Gillette does a better job. Gillette was nice enough to send me a free bottle of this shaving gel so I could share my thoughts, and this is what I came up with: I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off: The Scent. Alpine Clean is a pretty good descriptor. Smells clean and fresh, and reminds me of a light cologne whose name I can&#x27;t put my finger on. Definitely not overpowering, and went well with the after-shave I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it worked: Worked great. I had some Dove Shaving Gel that this replaced. Since I don&#x27;t use my SuperSpeed very often, I often irritate my skin, but this lathered up well, I didn&#x27;t have to use too much, and there was no irritation at all. It was everything you&#x27;d want a shaving gel to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others: This is a no-rust can (which is great since my bathroom gets pretty humid) and has an indicator letting you know how much product is left. I would (and will) get this again!</li>
    <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion Sensitive Gel Active Sport. I received the product from Gillette to test and review, I have used it several times and I think is great, its has a very cool feeling while shaving and afterwards. I would use it again for sure</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product to use, and finally they have fixed the issue with gel keeping popping out after you released the button - thank you Gillette! HOWEVER, now the problem is that it stops working while the can is still half full, meaning that now we have to pay twice as much for it and replace it twice more often, which is very frustrating! Once this problem is fixed, this gel will definitely deserve five stars!  UPD: Amazon was great in sending me a replacement, however this keeps happening with EVERY can. This is a major flaw, this is why I&#x27;m lowering this to 1-star. Wake up, Gillette and fix the issue ASAP!!!</li>
    <li> I am trying the Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel as a free trial and have really enjoyed it thus far. The gel/foaming experience isn&#x27;t all that different from previous Gillette gels I&#x27;ve used in the past-- the gel provides an incredibly close shave that other shaving creams and foams don&#x27;t provide. One distinct difference is that the experience of using/storing the can is much better with the plastic nozzle that doesn&#x27;t rust and removes that &amp;#34;ick&amp;#34; factor from the process. For me, the biggest plus for this gel was the warming/cooling sensation the gel provides. Washing the remaining gel off my face was a refreshing cool experience and I could skip the aftershave with no sensation of razor burn or skin discomfort. Overall, a great improvement on Gillette&#x27;s already positive shaving gels!</li>
    <li> I received the product as part of a promotional campaign.  The canister design  has a plastic bottom so no rust stains on the sink and it has a gauge to indicate how much product is left, which is a unique feature,  but the canister does seem to feel top heavy as the product is used.  The canister also has a no leak feature which is  nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works as advertised.  After using, my skin gets that “tingly” feeling and I’ve noticed fewer nicks on the chin area which is my “problem” area.  It does leave my skin with a softer and smoother feel after usage----no bumps or red spots.  I’ve also noticed that the product worked just as well with several days of growth as it does with minimal growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Alpine Clean scent which was strong enough to leave a bit of lasting smell, but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give the product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> ve tried all types of shave gel that does not compare to this product. This gel actually clings to the face making shaving less difficult. No mess after use and no rust stains on the sink for my wife to yell about! I love this product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The folks at Gillette were kind enough to send me a can of Fusion ProGlide Shave Gel free to try.  I&#x27;m picky about my shaving creams/gels and Gillette&#x27;s Fusion ProGlide Shave Gel has completely won me over.  From the design of the can, to the quality of the gel, to the way it makes my skin feel after I&#x27;m done shaving, this product is a winner.  To start, there&#x27;s no cap.  To open and close  you simply turn the top of the can - a small detail, yes, but if you ask me an important one - especially if you travel.  The gel is very dense so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get the job done.  It provides a very thick lather and when I&#x27;m done shaving a cool sensation that&#x27;s refreshing to the skin (I&#x27;m using the Alpine Clean gel).  I also really love the scent my face has after I&#x27;m done shaving - not overbearing, just a great fresh scent - as if I&#x27;ve used after shave but I really haven&#x27;t.  Finally, my skin is really smooth after shaving with the ProGlide shave gel.  It&#x27;s a great product and one I plan on continuing to use!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It gives such a close shave and my skin feels and smells great afterwards.  I am also trying the product for free thanks to Gillette!!</li>
    <li> Sometimes I need to be reminded not to cheap out on shave gel and receiving a free can of Gillette Fusions&#x27; Proglide Sensitive Shave Gel was the reminder I needed.  A smooth, clean smelling shave with convenient packaging that includes a sliding top that avoids any of that post shave cream residue on the bottle.  I keep mine in a drawer so with others it inevitably gets in the drawer or I have to wipe it off with this packaging I simply click the top into lock, there is also a gauge so I don&#x27;t unexpectedly run out.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used Gillette for years, plus I have sensitive skin so that&#x27;s also a plus.</li>
    <li> Wow what a great gel..I thought they were all the same  Until Gillette sent this to me for me to try....wow it come out of the can so easy and is thick and smells nice...then the lather is great..it is smooth and protects nice. I shaved 4 times with it and it was great no nicks or cuts... I will be purchasing this from now on.. Thanks Gilette for a great product</li>
    <li> I was asked to try this product for free. ProGlide 2 in 1 Shave Gel + Skin Care is cool and smooth.  It raises the hair for a smooth clean shave.  The gel does not make a mess outside the can.  What comes out of the can stays out and what does not come out of the can stays in the can.  You skin after using the ProGlide 2 in 1 Shave Gel + Skin Care is smooth, clean, and fresh.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of a BzzAgent program to give it a try.  I stopped using shave gel in a can years ago and switched to Kiehl&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t like the consistency of the gel, and they were too soapy and hard to rinse when I was done shaving.  I really like this one because it has a good consistency and rinses away easily.  Active Sport has has a nice subtle clean scent scent without too much perfume.</li>
    <li> Tried Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Sensitive Shave Gel + Skin Care as part of a free promotion from Gillette.  This is their best shave gel ever!  I have been a long time user of shave gell and this give the thickest, smoothest lather that I have ever used.  I will definitely be continuing to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary product to try ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care in Alpine Clean.  I am very happy with this product.  First of all this product smell good and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed.  Every time I use it my skin feels smooth and soft . I really like new  redesigned canister that has a clean-dispense actuator, gel gauge and a rust-free bottom. I always have  problems with shave gel&#x27;s rusting bottoms.  Also when I use it, I only need a small amount for shaving since it lathers really well and non irritating on my skin.</li>
    <li> I was able to try this product for free from Gilette. The way the shaving gel is packaged is much better than any other product. Not having a mess at the top and the rust resistant bottom is great. However, the pretty packaging cannot hide the hideous chemicals contained inside. Just do some research on the ingredients.For instance, Propylene glycol has been shown to be linked to cancer, developmental/reproductive issues, allergies/immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and organ system toxicity.</li>
    <li> You should really try the NEW Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care. The gel is great, but the design of the canister is what puts it above all the rest. It is mess free with a window that allows you to see exactly how much you have left in the can. Also the canister is made of plastic so no more rust rings in type shower, and the dispenser turns to seal the head off so that the foam does not continue to dribble out like other shaving gels. I shave in the shower and this has been a great improvement. You should know that I was trying the product for free thanks to Gillette.</li>
    <li> I love this new shave gel.  The container is completely redesigned and gets away from the standard design.  The button is new and does not ooze gel from the cap.  The button also has a locking feature that makes the can easily packable for on the go people like myself.  The best feature is the gauge on the side that shows you how much gel is left in the can.  There has been so many times when I have run out of shave gel mid shave. The gel itself does its job well and I look forward to trying the different types.  Got to try this product free thanks to Gillette. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I have been participating in a what might be called a test panel for BuzzAgent.com regarding the Gillette profusion Pro Glide Razor and the shave gel.  I have already posted a review for the razor somewhere on this site.  The shave gel is good, it smells good and seems to provide a smooth shave along with the 5 blades.  However the can is very close to loosing it&#x27;s ability to shoot the gel out of the can and it&#x27;s still about half full.  I can&#x27;t call this a good deal if the can is going to withhold half the gel.  This forced me to use just a plain old bar of soap to shave with.  I found out that I got just as comfortable a shave with that as with the gel.  I can&#x27;t recommend this if the can is going to fail.  I gave BuzzAgent a readers digest version of this review and they rejected it because I gave a negative review they didn&#x27;t want to give to the manufacturer.  I&#x27;m sorry.  I&#x27;m not the rear end kissing type.  I tell it like it is.  You don&#x27;t like it BuzzAgent??  TOO BAD!!</li>
