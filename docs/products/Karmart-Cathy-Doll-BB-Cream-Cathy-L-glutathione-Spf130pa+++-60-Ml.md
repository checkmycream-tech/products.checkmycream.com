### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>so proud</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works good for lite pp with two tone I 2</li>
      <li>pleaze try thiz product itz so good.....</li>
      <li>but maybe not in a good way.</li>
      <li>and since you can&#x27;t reduce hyperpigmentation without sun block, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>This is good guys.</li>
      <li>I love this cream!</li>
      <li>Need more time to determine its effects.</li>
      <li>After many years of searching for a primer that would help reduce the sweating but not clog my pores, I came across this.</li>
      <li>So glad I bought this before summer, does what it says.</li>
      <li>I wanted something to even out my arms and face since I get the most sun exposure there</li>
      <li>L-glutathione Magic Cream SPF 50 pa+++\\&quot; and some Korean writing under it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff to bits</li>
      <li>I love it&lt;</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>The box said Cathy Doll, but wasn&#x27;t sure if what I got was a legit Cathy Doll product by Karmart.</li>
      <li>and I want more love it</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>Used it and really love this cream, love the SPF 130.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it hopefully it still lightens my complexion and also protects my skin since it does contain the L-Glutathione and Titanium dioxide :)</li>
      <li>the brown spots are better than faded...</li>
      <li>I Love it and it makes your skin so smooth.</li>
      <li>The only good thing is that it makes your skin look milky, and creamy if you have a fair skin tone (temporary), gets rid of redness, and pimples, but it comes off with water, so this is not an actual &#x27;whitener&#x27;, like I said, literally clown make-up, and it also smells good.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>My complexion is a light olive tone and with this sunscreen, my skin tone became lighter but kinda grayish.</li>
      <li>My skin got kind of burned and really tan over the summer, so I bought this thinking</li>
      <li>I stopped using it after a week, so I really cannot comment on whether it makes your skin look better.</li>
      <li>Maybe i really dont know since I dont love it justo like it</li>
      <li>Nice product so far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super protective sunscreen</li>
      <li>I received it quickly.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d DEFINITELY buy more soon!</li>
      <li>amazing product overall!!</li>
      <li>Now the product itself, now knowing that it is a sunscreen, I wore it and it is kind of sheer, not too greasy feeling but with a watery cream texture.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice and they claim the L-glutathione lightens your skin naturally over time, but I don&#x27;t use it that often, so I can&#x27;t really validate that claim.</li>
      <li>My face looks as fresh after work as it did after I put it on in the morning.</li>
      <li>It takes time but its worth the wait.</li>
      <li>I was order the first time</li>
      <li>So while I really love this product for it&#x27;s scent and the fact that it does in fact make your skin lighter temporarily, I&#x27;ve been using it daily over a month</li>
      <li>First of all this took a month to get here.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t think it would do too much lightening on my face.</li>
      <li>It looks redicolous on me, I. A white Caucasian with light to medium skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>tone of neck skin much improved.</li>
      <li>keeps my skin looking nice with it on, but the fact that now without it I&#x27;m full of acne because of it is no good.</li>
      <li>This cream acts like a sunscreen for me and if I put it on before I walk out the door it has my face feeling smooth all day long</li>
      <li>so I highly recommend this for what you want.</li>
      <li>I love pale porcelain looking skin</li>
      <li>Facial skin very much improved...</li>
      <li>when I apply my usual foundation on top of it, my face looks gray.</li>
      <li>It is literally just like white make-up your putting on your body, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get the same effect from using white clown make-up.</li>
      <li>AT first this product makes you look ashy and looks bad lol</li>
      <li>Holy super white skin, I think this thing is just white paint in a tube.</li>
      <li>the smell is kinda of a soft flowery scent.</li>
      <li>I went to the karmart website and they actually sell this product, so it is real.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m liking it a lot.</li>
      <li>This cream goes on smooth, makes my pores less visible and protects my skin from the sun!</li>
      <li>, I love how it has a very high SPF but has an nice floral smell instead of a disgusting sunblock smell.</li>
      <li>It is like the reviews say, white paste , but I put a tiny bit on my face, and whipe off the rest of the residue, it did close my pores and make my face soft, so hopefully there is long term effects of this.</li>

<li> , I love how it has a very high SPF but has an nice floral smell instead of a disgusting sunblock smell.</li>
<li> It is like the reviews say, white paste , but I put a tiny bit on my face, and whipe off the rest of the residue, it did close my pores and make my face soft, so hopefully there is long term effects of this.</li>
<li> It does use a physical UV barrier so the cream gives a light white tint to skin which I do not mind since I am very pale but it may look strange on dark skin tones.</li>
<li> but i received a whitening sunscreen with just a spf 50 Have tried it and gives you a white effect but haven&#x27;t used long enough to know if it does anything.  </li>
<li> The only thing is to use it with other light lotion because it is very thick.</li>
<li> I am already pale (NC20) at M.A.C. and My body has years and years of suntans since I live in a tropical island.</li>
<li> I bought this not too long ago</li>
<li> It whitens you instantly and for the long run (if you apply everyday).</li>
<li> No matter how little I apply, it still looks like a white layer on my face.  </li>
<li> Trying to put on foundation while you&#x27;re sweating like you just finished the New York marathon is NOT a good look.</li>
<li> It didnt lighten my face extremely but it went gradually as i used it.</li>
<li> Not worth it</li>
<li> Really love this product I use it as a base before my makeup.</li>
<li> so it helps you avoid getting tanner and hides previous tan lines.</li>
<li> it would lighten my skin a little bit.</li>
<li> It looked a little too unnatural for my liking, though.</li>
<li> , looks terrible in person or in photos, can&#x27;t believe it got any good reviews, maybe for People and ethnicities that like chalky white skin, useless piece of item</li>
<li> it did not work waste of money</li>
<li> BUT through out time I saw the difference not a huge one</li>
<li> I was still not sure if this was legit.</li>
<li> What a waste of money!</li>
<li> This was a gross, chalky consistency that was very difficult to rub or absorb into my skin.</li>
<li> Plus the shipping was very slow, and no tracking information.</li>
<li> and it does not whiten,and it has broken me out.&lt;br</li>
<li> Poor poor product.</li>
<li> and the product is useless.</li>
<li> still like the scent and the temporary effects, but unfortunately if it doesn&#x27;t work for another month it&#x27;ll be discarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but unfortunately I was not home at the time, I had no clue that there was a post office at my house telling me to go pick it up</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t use a lot if you&#x27;re tan because it looks weird.</li>
<li> boy was I wrong!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really love this product I use it as a base before my makeup. It actually evens out my skins. However, I do not think that the product actually lightens the skin its just an immediate whiteness which will wash away when you shower.</li>
    <li> I received it quickly. It&#x27;s got a lot of sun block so I use it when I&#x27;m not going to sweat working out.  It goes on smoothly and since you can&#x27;t reduce hyperpigmentation without sun block, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This was a gross, chalky consistency that was very difficult to rub or absorb into my skin. I tried it on my knees and wore pants to avoid sun exposure, but it just made me look ashy (I&#x27;m a brown skin girl). I wanted something to even out my arms and face since I get the most sun exposure there but I don&#x27;t want to look chalky, gross, and ashy in the process.</li>
    <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;It works good for lite pp with two tone I 2 and I want more love it&lt;br /&gt;Only get if you lite skin  love it</li>
    <li> hello&lt;br /&gt;everyone pleaze try thiz product itz so good..... youre gonna have a suncreeen a moisturiser a primer n a foundation all in one..... n above all it dosent break out .....</li>
    <li> I sweat...A LOT. Especially in the morning. Which wouldn&#x27;t matter if I didn&#x27;t wear makeup. Trying to put on foundation while you&#x27;re sweating like you just finished the New York marathon is NOT a good look. After many years of searching for a primer that would help reduce the sweating but not clog my pores, I came across this. I put this on before my foundation and glamour. My face looks as fresh after work as it did after I put it on in the morning. Another &#x27;must-have&#x27; for my diva arsenal.</li>
    <li> but maybe not in a good way. My skin got kind of burned and really tan over the summer, so I bought this thinking it would lighten my skin a little bit. Holy super white skin, I think this thing is just white paint in a tube. It looks like you just put a ton of sunblock on your face without rubbing it in all the way. It totally creeped me out, so I just started mixing it in with my tinted moisturizers so that I could still use it. It smells really nice and they claim the L-glutathione lightens your skin naturally over time, but I don&#x27;t use it that often, so I can&#x27;t really validate that claim. Anyway, if you want your face to be a totally different color from the rest of your skin, you might like this. It looked a little too unnatural for my liking, though.</li>
    <li> This just makes you lighter it doesnt even your skin tone or lighten over time. This temporary fix. This shipment arrive from thailand.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I use a whitening soap in the shower and taking glutathione pills too, to speed things up and I&#x27;m in love. It takes time but its worth the wait. This cream acts like a sunscreen for me and if I put it on before I walk out the door it has my face feeling smooth all day long and I feel that it covers up my pores. I also use it on the darker spots on my body. So far I&#x27;m liking it a lot.</li>
    <li> I Love it and it makes your skin so smooth. The only thing is to use it with other light lotion because it is very thick. I dont use makeup when I use this cream.</li>
    <li> This is literally a temporary fix, doesn&#x27;t tone out, or even your skin at all! It is literally just like white make-up your putting on your body, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get the same effect from using white clown make-up. Plus the shipping was very slow, and no tracking information. The only good thing is that it makes your skin look milky, and creamy if you have a fair skin tone (temporary), gets rid of redness, and pimples, but it comes off with water, so this is not an actual &#x27;whitener&#x27;, like I said, literally clown make-up, and it also smells good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this which I thought was a whitening bb cream but i received a whitening sunscreen with just a spf 50 Have tried it and gives you a white effect but haven&#x27;t used long enough to know if it does anything.  Besides I thought I was getting makeup not this.</li>
    <li> so...I ordered the Cathy Doll BB cream L-Glutathione with SPF130 that is shown...but I got a completely different item. First of all this took a month to get here. When it arrived the box already looked different to me. The box said Cathy Doll, but wasn&#x27;t sure if what I got was a legit Cathy Doll product by Karmart. On further inspection, I read the name of the product, which said \\&quot;Cathy Doll |Whitening Sunscreen| L-glutathione Magic Cream SPF 50 pa+++\\&quot; and some Korean writing under it. On the back of the box it had the Karmart website, phone number and a QR code. I was still not sure if this was legit. I went to the karmart website and they actually sell this product, so it is real. This was not what I ordered though. Now the product itself, now knowing that it is a sunscreen, I wore it and it is kind of sheer, not too greasy feeling but with a watery cream texture. It does \\&quot;tighten\\&quot; pores (or it seems to cover them well) the smell is kinda of a soft flowery scent. My complexion is a light olive tone and with this sunscreen, my skin tone became lighter but kinda grayish. I will continue to use it hopefully it still lightens my complexion and also protects my skin since it does contain the L-Glutathione and Titanium dioxide :)</li>
    <li> No matter how little I apply, it still looks like a white layer on my face.  I also don&#x27;t  like the greasy look it gives me. when I apply my usual foundation on top of it, my face looks gray. I stopped using it after a week, so I really cannot comment on whether it makes your skin look better.</li>
    <li> Works great. Don&#x27;t use a lot if you&#x27;re tan because it looks weird.</li>
    <li> Used it and really love this cream, love the SPF 130. I&#x27;ll buy it again. Already recommend to all of my people I know. Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to alert people who&#x27;s want to order this product:  I was order the first time is SPF 130 but the second time SPF only 50. Poor poor product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as claimed</li>
    <li> So while I really love this product for it&#x27;s scent and the fact that it does in fact make your skin lighter temporarily, I&#x27;ve been using it daily over a month and it does not whiten,and it has broken me out.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my skin looking nice with it on, but the fact that now without it I&#x27;m full of acne because of it is no good. I didn&#x27;t actually NEED makeup before.lol&lt;br /&gt;I still like the scent and the temporary effects, but unfortunately if it doesn&#x27;t work for another month it&#x27;ll be discarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, yeah, don&#x27;t use this on your face.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smooth, makes my pores less visible and protects my skin from the sun! This works well for me as a primer under my makeup, I love how it has a very high SPF but has an nice floral smell instead of a disgusting sunblock smell. It does use a physical UV barrier so the cream gives a light white tint to skin which I do not mind since I am very pale but it may look strange on dark skin tones.</li>
    <li> This is good guys. Buy it and you will know it I bought this and I&amp;#34;m so proud I love that is water proof</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American and I ordered three of these creams, it was ordered the ending of March and It was shipped to my house on April 9th but unfortunately I was not home at the time, I had no clue that there was a post office at my house telling me to go pick it up so I didn&#x27;t end up getting these until April 22nd. It is like the reviews say, white paste , but I put a tiny bit on my face, and whipe off the rest of the residue, it did close my pores and make my face soft, so hopefully there is long term effects of this. Will leave another review in the future !</li>
    <li> The cream seems to have improved the back of my hands..the brown spots are better than faded...tone of neck skin much improved.Facial skin very much improved...</li>
    <li> Actually works! It whitens you instantly and for the long run (if you apply everyday). I suggest buying in this smaller size before buying the bigger one so you can check if you like it. It&#x27;s a super protective sunscreen so it helps you avoid getting tanner and hides previous tan lines.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money! Left a white residue n no changes on my face after over a month of daily use</li>
    <li> I bought this not too long ago and I didn&#x27;t think it would do too much lightening on my face. boy was I wrong! It didnt lighten my face extremely but it went gradually as i used it. I love pale porcelain looking skin so I highly recommend this for what you want. I love this stuff to bits and I&#x27;d DEFINITELY buy more soon! amazing product overall!!</li>
    <li> If you want a white pasty zic oxide like gew on your face to clog your pores then order this. It looks redicolous on me, I. A white Caucasian with light to medium skin. It&#x27;s so white and pasty I can&#x27;t even use under make up, looks terrible in person or in photos, can&#x27;t believe it got any good reviews, maybe for People and ethnicities that like chalky white skin, useless piece of item</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this before summer, does what it says. Will be repurchasing before I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also stuck some yummy candies in the package. Always a plus!</li>
    <li> it did not work waste of money</li>
    <li> Nice product so far. Need more time to determine its effects.</li>
    <li> I am already pale (NC20) at M.A.C. and My body has years and years of suntans since I live in a tropical island. I bought this productos to even my arms and legs from years of tan skin and AT first this product makes you look ashy and looks bad lol BUT through out time I saw the difference not a huge one like I tought it would.So would I buy this product again? Maybe i really dont know since I dont love it justo like it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it , The cream is like magnesium your skin looks like clow face for circus , I feel disapointed</li>
    <li> After you apply it, its just white patches. Not worth it and the product is useless.</li>
</ol>
