      <li>I love the way my hair looks when I use this.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This tool gave me exactly what I was looking for and expecting. I got it to do an 80&#x27;s/early-90&#x27;s look and it worked great! The cool thing I like about it is that you don&#x27;t have to just use it for tight waves--if you space out where you put it on your hair you can get that beachy look, too. Only thing I would say is that the low heating setting is really low...even if you have fine hair I&#x27;d start it at least a third of the way up on the heat setting.</li>
    <li> Pros: love it. I wanted one forever finally got one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: expensive</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I asked around before I purchased my first triple barrel and I have been very happy with my choice.  Others have said that similar products that are cheaper don&#x27;t work as well.  You don&#x27;t get as much of a wave.  Some of my recommendations: Don&#x27;t wash your hair that morning.  It works and holds better on day old hair.  Especially if there is still hairspray left in your hair.  Also, to get a perfect wave, start at the top of the hair strand and clamp it.  Then, for the next clamp, flip the barrel upside down so it stays in order.  Hope this helps!  I always get so many compliments when I wear my hair this way. ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its the barrel or if it was my plug. I think because it&#x27;s a US plug, and I used a different voltage, it caused some issues even with the voltage converter. The barrel started smelling like something burnt and smoke started coming out of it. I shut it off before it exploded on me.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair looks when I use this.  Hot Tools rock!</li>
    <li> will tried it hope works good but other than that it arrive on time. thanks</li>
    <li> I  got it today and tried it immediately.  It works really well. Does not frizz my hair out.  Great too for adding body if you brush it out and add some shine serum. It also holds the mermaid look great in my hair.  It is impossible to curl my hair.  I have poker straight and fine  hair that doesn&#x27;t curl&#x3D; and this thing worked :)  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I wanted a barrel roller that had big barrels. This one will do but wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for. Gives a smaller wave than what I wanted but cant seem to find the size I need.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my 11 year old grand daughter. She really likes it, and uses it everyday. I was worried about safety features so she wouldn&#x27;t get burned. It is a very well made product.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to get this after seeing the commercials for it, what a let down and waste of good money!!! It did not do a thing to my hair but frizz it more!!  You would be better off going and getting the vintage crimping iron, those work!! this does not.   DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.   PRODUCT IS USELESS.</li>
    <li> This birthday present for my grand-daughter was described by her as the very best she had hoped for. Apparently does everything she wanted. Don&#x27;t use them myself but who can argue with such a response from an informed teenager.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is everything I expected!!</li>
    <li> the curling barrels are too small and leave hair looking like it was &#x27;crimped&#x27;... Functionally it works well though so if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> This an awesome product. I bought this one to replace the one I&#x27;ve had for several years.  It&#x27;s great for crimping all types of hair and it works fairly quickly.  I don&#x27;t have to hold it long to get the crimps either.    Another thing is the price was pretty reasonable.  In addition I know its gonna last a while.  This really is the best crimper I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the pink titanium hot tools waver.. let&#x27;s just say it went back the next day. Then I purchased this one, is all I can say is I love it and so does my 12 year old daughter. The waver stays very hot, I have it set to the highest setting since my hair is really long and thick. The only down fall about this is the is very time consuming. It takes at least hour in a half to do all my hair, and it works much better on dirty hair verses clean hair. Very good product, and very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected:(</li>
    <li> This hair crimper gave me a very nice crimped hair. Very similar to Taylor Swift. However, whenever I on the crimper there&#x27;s smog coming out from the crimper. I need to leave hot iron open so I ended up gripping a crimper while it&#x27;s heating to prevent the smog. Overall this is a great crimper, it gives me very define curls and you can increase and decrease the temperature.</li>
    <li> The waver took a while to ship and get to my house, but in the end it was a wonderful decision. I have permed my hair in the past, and I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I just got my product today, and it was just what I was looking for! Comfortable to hold, and great brand! I will be posting a picture of the results tonight after I do it!!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, got it quickly. I love doing hair, love my hair being different everyday! And this handy little device helps with that!</li>
    <li> My old one died, not totally, but it just wasn&#x27;t performing (after 14 years!!!) because I dropped it and broke the plastic handle.  It still was working, and though I &amp;#34;fixed it&amp;#34; with duck tape, (yes, I know usually a man&#x27;s fix, but it worked) but after months of using it that way, I just thought &amp;#34;Why don&#x27;t I see if I can get a new one?&amp;#34;  Amazon had it, and with Amazon Prime, it was in my hands in the NEXY day!  Local company, so unless you are in So. California, don&#x27;t expect it that fast!  Great seller, they must have stuck it in the mail the day I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Prime ROCKS!!!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that curls easily with a curling iron, so I thought this would wave my hair nicely. Hardly waved it at all! It may not get hot enough for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect waves. Stays hot so requires less time. Would definitely buy it again. Love all my Hot Tools. They are the best</li>
    <li> Not Good quality. waste of money</li>
    <li> Paid too much money for this!  My teen daughter really wanted one and we are disappointed that it is awkward for her to use it without help.  She cannot possibly reach the back of her hair with it being such an awkward angle and so clunky.</li>
    <li> A fantastic purchase. If you&#x27;re looking for something a little different to do with your hair, try this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I use it religiously and swear by Hot Tools items. I seriously do not have anything but good things to saw about this curling/crimping iron!!</li>
    <li> Nice product but I just think it makes my hair look frizzy rather than wavy.</li>
    <li> Bought this after receiving an older one from a friend but I wanted one with a heat dial. Absolutely love this and how fast it heats up! Works great and has an extra long cord which is awesome because so many of my other hair tools have short ones.</li>
    <li> Although the product pictured is not what I received (it was a spring handle)this company was extremely good to deal with. They answered all my emails quickly and gave me a full refund. I would most definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> great price. I do hair for a living and even with my licensed discount from the supply shop, this price is cut in half. great buy. great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece, and she says it is perfect in every way. She uses it all the time, and loves it.</li>
    <li> My hair barely lays on my shoulders and this waver still works really good on my hair. I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had short hair. Recently I&#x27;ve been growing it out and haven&#x27;t know what to do with it. This tool is really easy. Once you get a technique down it can all be done really quickly. I really wish this iron had come with a heat glove though. Also, it&#x27;s more a crimper than a waver, but I do have really thin fine hair.</li>
    <li> Definitely gives you the wavy look, but doing small sections works best so it does take some time to get this look.</li>
    <li> I did it myself and it looks great.If you need curls ,if you need volume-that&#x27;s the answer. I love it, it take&#x27;s time  for long hair like mine but the result is worthed!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this iron it makes my hair so pretty!! Use small sections and run your fingers through when done and spray! So cute!</li>
    <li> This was my first waver. My stylist had waved my hair once and I was afraid that I would not be able to get the same results at home, but this product met all my expectations! Love it!</li>
    <li> This worked great on my six year old daughters hair, her hair is about shoulder length or a little shorter and it look a good 30-45 minutes to finish. Her hair looked great and it even held the curl over night and looked just as good the next morning and her hair does not hold curl well. I actually bought it for me but after using it on her I realized that with my length of hair (past my shoulder blades) it would take too long and be difficult to do on myself. I will use it on her hair again for sure.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the curler. Doesn&#x27;t heat up very well, I have to hold on my daughters hair for like a minute for it before it gets hot enough to curl.</li>
    <li> Does  not heat up enough to curl my hair.  A huge disappointment and a waste of money. Seller wouldn&#x27;t let me return.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and this actually crimps without hesitation, I love it, I can&#x27;t find many hair products that work this great, I love Hot Tools!</li>
    <li> perfect waves, love it.</li>
    <li> Had to replace the Helen of troy one I had after the storms.  I have fine hair and love the adjustable settings and leaves a nice wave in my hair.  Use small sections of hair but curling goes quickly.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! Heats up quickly. I have super super thin hair and this holds the curls all day.</li>
    <li> On the fense with this one.  I don&#x27;t really like how my hair waves</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this very often, but it works well. I have the heat turned up to ten, but it seems like it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my other Hot Tools curling iron. This was $20 cheaper on Amazon than at Ulta.</li>
    <li> I let it heat about 20 minutes,and I started clamping my hair. Crimped about 2 strands and this item fell apart and almost burned my face and leg. Getting returned asap! Also the crimps it gave were not that defined. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I am so far pretty happy with it other than the fact that I don&#x27;t think it got too hot even at the highest setting. But it heats up quite fast which is good and looks great once you do it.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I have very straight and fine hair that does not hold a curl to save my life. This gave me beautiful thick volume that was nice and wavy, love it!</li>
    <li> It works better after ironing your hair for those who have curly hair already. I really like the waves, they have the perfect sizes and shape</li>
    <li> These hot tools irons are my favorite irons ever. I curl my hair with them all the time. They last a long time and whenever I have had an issue when first receiving the product- they were always helpful. I recommend this for sure.</li>
    <li> Looooove.  I have thin hair, so when I use this all over I am a little closer to God with my volumized hair.. haha.  It is really nice quality and i would recommend it for wide waves.</li>
    <li> Horrible!! It literally broke the first time I used it. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I had a different one with a plastic handle that lasted longer. I thought this one would last longer because it was made of metal but I was wrong!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for what it is, I do think if you want extremely small crimpy hair then this is probably what you want.... I was more looking for a beachy loose wave or at least that perfect S curl. I have long hair so maybe this product is just not suited for long hair. I probably will not use it again but I can&#x27;t blame Hot Tools (it&#x27;s the only brand of curling iron I ever use) I am sure it does what it is supposed to I just personally had different expectations.</li>
    <li> This curler gets HOT! And it works great, but let me say this again: &amp;#34;This curler gets HOT!&amp;#34; And with no safeguard, you must be very careful using it. As pictured, please note that there is no finger guard on the end of the barrel(s), so you are forced to curl one-handed. However, it gives great natural curl, and I like how I can adjust the heat setting.</li>
    <li> Love this! Does awesome waves getting the look I want :) attached selfie lol only to show how perfect the waves come out!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I had been looking for! Would reccomend it to anyone looking for a wave look with all the same size barrels.</li>
    <li> It heats fast and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.  I love it.  That should say enough, but this is requiring more words.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and it&#x27;s easy to use. I didn&#x27;t get the beachy beach I was going for...it looked more crimped. I got better results when I had lots of product on before I used it.</li>
    <li> I love it and it gets extremely hot and makes my hair look great after I&#x27;m done</li>
    <li> Device is disabled I can not traceable,, how is redemptive</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a search for &#x27;the best wide barrel crimp iron EVER&#x27; since mine broke about two years ago. Found it. Hot Tools Professional is perfect if you like awesome waves in your hair that last for more than a day. YAY!!! So happy my search is finally over.</li>
    <li> Works great, definitely what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I bought this to curl my hair, even though I usually do it with my flat iron.  I still prefer my flat iron over this though.  This burned me a couple times. There is not much skin protection.  Just don&#x27;t touch anywhere where there is gold.  But it did what it is supposed to! I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands &amp; the handle is always to hot to hold but hot tools doesn&#x27;t do that. I own several other hot tools &amp; will never use any other brand.</li>
    <li> Finally a hair styling tool I can use&lt;br /&gt;Im not so great at operating hair tools or even doing my hair for that matter. I have shoulder length hair I&#x27;m growing out and it&#x27;s been a real pain cause I don&#x27;t know how to make it look good&lt;br /&gt;But this tool is easy to use and I don&#x27;t burn myself with it&lt;br /&gt;I really like how the cord swivels so it&#x27;ll never snap.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks amazing for days until I wash it and do it again</li>
    <li> The barrels are smaller than expected but hot tools are always good products to buy! And they last for years.</li>
    <li> Hot tools is the best.  I have hair that is hard to curl, get the Hot Tool out!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally straight and hard to curl. With this iron my curls can last up to 3 days!</li>
    <li> I love this! I use this all the time and it is so fun! I get compliments all the time and get asked how I get my hair to do the &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34;It does take a little time but once you get the hang of it..it gets easy!!</li>
    <li> It was not at all what I thought it was.  It didn&#x27;t even curl my hair or make it wavy.  Very disappointed and do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works well but takes a bit to heat up. Also it makes me look more 90&#x27;s and I was going for a more bohemian look. Still, for what it is, it works well. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had a 3 barrel a few times before. Went with a f&#x3D;different brand than hot tools last time and was VERY unhappy. Hot tools is good for your hair and gives a great desired look when done. Use hot tools and you will not be disappointed. Great product, good value for your money</li>
