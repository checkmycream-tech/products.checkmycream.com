      <li>Colors are great</li>
      <li>Great purchase.</li>
      <li>This three pack is great</li>
      <li>For the money, this was a good purchase.</li>
      <li>loved the turbie towels gave them as gifts.</li>
      <li>I have them in my own home and use them every night.  </li>
      <li>I love these all cotton Turbie Twists.  </li>
      <li>love the pattern on these.</li>
      <li>love the 100% cotton turbie twist.</li>
      <li>I have a microfiber Turbie that I absolutely love.  </li>
      <li>These are much much better than the micro ones they have out now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They love the product and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll like this design.</li>
      <li>hope you WILL get more designs...</li>
      <li>Yeah,gotta have more.</li>
      <li>And the snowflakes make them cute.</li>
      <li>Hopefully they don&#x27;t sell out before I order more.</li>
      <li>Love them, I use it all the time now.</li>
      <li>but they work ok.</li>
      <li>Their ok..  not like others ive gotten before..  kinda feel like microfiber ones which I dont like</li>
      <li>wonderfull gift for my niece thanks great seller</li>
      <li>And they came very quickly :3</li>
      <li>The cotton is very soft and absorbent, everyone that received them absolutely loved them.  </li>
      <li>Those were of a thicker cotton, these feel cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>I love turbie towels, I&#x27;m just not crazy about the snowflake design on these.</li>
      <li>So, all in all, I&#x27;m happy with them, but I&#x27;m going to look for solid color ones.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic instead of using a full sized towel.  </li>
      <li>Also, be sure to wash them first</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also great for wrapping your hair up when you don&#x27;t want to get it wet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good enough for my purposes, though.</li>
      <li>I love the real cotton turbie twists..</li>
      <li>and when I took a good look at it, you could see it was much thinner and not nearly as tightly woven as the cream ones I have.  </li>
      <li>love these keep head warm and dry fast.</li>
      <li>Definitely keeps the sneezes away and the kiddos warm.</li>
      <li>I really like these, but I like the microfiber ones (by same company) even better, although they cost more.</li>
      <li>So much easier than wrapping a full towel around your hair while you do makeup.  </li>
      <li>but these are worth using the whole year!</li>
      <li>I love how it eliminates having to use a huge bath towel for wet hair.  </li>
      <li>Love the designs, but even more, they are heavy Terrycloth.</li>
      <li>Previously I ordered the Turbie Twist Cotton Hair Towel 3 pack in cream and loved them.  </li>
      <li>I have some old turbie twist hair towels that are much thicker and more absorbent.</li>
      <li>It is nice to have a separate hair towel that is not huge and one the stays securely wrapped.</li>
      <li>I have used this product since QVC first brought it out years ago.  </li>
      <li>but want something different for spring,summer,fall.  :)</li>
      <li>Sure beats trying to button it, like on my last one.</li>
      <li>I used the first Turbie I had until it was literally a shredded rag.  </li>
      <li>bought them for whole family for xmas.</li>
      <li>These are terry cloth and very absorbent.  </li>
      <li>I would absolutely buy these again..</li>
      <li>but they are the only ones that are like the original.</li>
      <li>I am more of a fan of your previous towels that were velour.</li>
      <li>I purchased an older version of these years ago and now they are a bit dingy after 10 years or so.</li>
      <li>They were extremely absorbent and stayed on easily.  </li>
      <li>I will still use them because the twist design works well, but they don&#x27;t absorb the water from my hair like the old ones did.</li>
      <li>I prefer these to the microfiber as I just like regular ole&#x27; terrycloth for absorbing moisture.  </li>
      <li>I purchased 9 for Christmas stocking stuffers-5 were for granddaughters 8 yrs old and under.</li>
      <li>because I didn&#x27;t and the first time I used them, they just would NOT absorb the wet hair.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully, the more I was it, the less drips will be down my back.</li>
      <li>Bought these as Christmas gifts for my daughters and found these are so much thicker and softer than all the other Turbie Twist microfiber ones we have.  </li>
      <li>The towels do a good job but they are so thick that it is hard to lock into the loop.  </li>
      <li>I have about this product and hence only 4 stars is it not as thick feeling as the original ones from QVC.  </li>

<li> Not worth sending back</li>
<li> After using it, a stream of water dripped down my back.  </li>
<li> I also have them in my RV as they take up less space than a regular towel for my hair.</li>
<li> But these new turbie twists are thin and not very absorbent.</li>
<li> When I wrapped my wet hair in one, water continued to stream down my face.  </li>
<li> only complaint</li>
<li> This will allow me to wander around doing all the morning routines without feeling weighted down from using a reg. bath towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The towels have lots of left over loose annoying material on surface after washing.</li>
<li> A little expensive though,</li>
<li> Not the whimpy thin stuff.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>

But these new turbie twists are thin and not very absorbent. Disappointing. I will still use them because the twist design works well, but they don&#x27;t absorb the water from my hair like the old ones did.</li>
    <li> I have a microfiber Turbie that I absolutely love.  Got this one for Christmas, it still does the job, but didn&#x27;t seem to absorb all the water from my hair.  After using it, a stream of water dripped down my back.  I will still use it.  Hopefully, the more I was it, the less drips will be down my back.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how we&#x27;d handle our girls swimming classes without this.  Definitely keeps the sneezes away and the kiddos warm.</li>
    <li> I love turbie towels, I&#x27;m just not crazy about the snowflake design on these. I only ordered these because they were the only cotton ones I could find (I don&#x27;t like the microfiber). So, all in all, I&#x27;m happy with them, but I&#x27;m going to look for solid color ones.</li>
    <li> I know they have a Christmas style to them but these are worth using the whole year! they are very good cotton and good for those who need it for longer hair! And they came very quickly :3</li>
    <li> I used the first Turbie I had until it was literally a shredded rag.  I actually kept sewing it back up.  These are fantastic instead of using a full sized towel.  They&#x27;re also great for wrapping your hair up when you don&#x27;t want to get it wet.</li>
    <li> love these keep head warm and dry fast. bought them for whole family for xmas. everyone loves them  a must have</li>
    <li> Their ok..  not like others ive gotten before..  kinda feel like microfiber ones which I dont like but they work ok.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t absorb water at all</li>
    <li> Love the designs, but even more, they are heavy Terrycloth. Not the whimpy thin stuff. I really like these, but I like the microfiber ones (by same company) even better, although they cost more.</li>
    <li> I purchased 9 for Christmas stocking stuffers-5 were for granddaughters 8 yrs old and under. I had purchased some a few years ago and really like the 100% cotton ones so I searched for these and found them! I had also tried the micro-fiber ones before but they do not soak up the water out of your hair as well as these do. I would definately recommend turbie twist cotton hair towel. I also have them in my RV as they take up less space than a regular towel for my hair.</li>
    <li> Hopefully they don&#x27;t sell out before I order more.THEY ARE WONDERFUL.Very absorbent.And the snowflakes make them cute.Yeah,gotta have more.CUTE.Must have.All the turbine twists are perfect.</li>
    <li> Bought these as Christmas gifts for my daughters and found these are so much thicker and softer than all the other Turbie Twist microfiber ones we have.  Like.</li>
    <li> loved the turbie towels gave them as gifts. The cotton is very soft and absorbent, everyone that received them absolutely loved them.  I would absolutely buy these again..</li>
    <li> I purchased an older version of these years ago and now they are a bit dingy after 10 years or so. I prefer these to the microfiber as I just like regular ole&#x27; terrycloth for absorbing moisture.  It is nice to have a separate hair towel that is not huge and one the stays securely wrapped. This three pack is great and I considered buying extras as Christmas gifts! Great purchase.</li>
    <li> love the 100% cotton turbie twist. wouldn&#x27;t buy the microfiber stuff. love the pattern on these. bought them for gifts.</li>
    <li> The towels have lots of left over loose annoying material on surface after washing. I am more of a fan of your previous towels that were velour. They did not &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34;...I  washed them about 10 times and had to use the clothes razor to get them useable</li>
    <li> I love these all cotton Turbie Twists.  I have them in my own home and use them every night.  I also bought a number of these for Christmas gifts last year.  So much easier than wrapping a full towel around your hair while you do makeup.  It absorbs lots of water and lessens the time you need to spend with a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Great idea for a stocking stuffer for my wife, daughter and grand-daughter! They will each get a turbie!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They love the product and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll like this design.</li>
    <li> These are much much better than the micro ones they have out now. These are terry cloth and very absorbent.  A little expensive though, but they are the only ones that are like the original.</li>
    <li> Does not want to stay on the head. Disappointed</li>
    <li> Previously I ordered the Turbie Twist Cotton Hair Towel 3 pack in cream and loved them.  They were extremely absorbent and stayed on easily.  When I went to reorder, it showed they were not available but these seemed to be the same, just in bizarre prints, but since very few people see you in a hair towel I ordered them.  Very disappointed.  When I wrapped my wet hair in one, water continued to stream down my face.  There was no drying ability to it and when I took a good look at it, you could see it was much thinner and not nearly as tightly woven as the cream ones I have.  Not worth sending back so I use them for dusting.</li>
    <li> I love the real cotton turbie twists.. the price was great ...them came before x-mas as promised.. hope you WILL get more designs...Snowflakes are great for winter ...but want something different for spring,summer,fall.  :)</li>
    <li> I like the ease of twisting and then tucking it into the elastic. Sure beats trying to button it, like on my last one. If you needed to, you could do it one-handed.  I also like that it&#x27;s cotton and not micro-fiber.  However, on the downside, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as absorbent as the almost threadbare one it&#x27;s replacing.  It&#x27;s good enough for my purposes, though. For the money, this was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The towels do a good job but they are so thick that it is hard to lock into the loop.  Colors are great and I expect they will lose their plumpness after several washings.</li>
    <li> It sheds colored fuzz that stays in my hair.</li>
    <li> wonderfull gift for my niece thanks great seller</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, my wife says.</li>
