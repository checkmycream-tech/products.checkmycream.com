      <li>Taste was ok.</li>
      <li>Make sure to drink water before and after</li>
      <li>Love the chocolate crunch.  </li>
      <li>Thicker though. :-)</li>
      <li>This diet is way too easy.</li>
      <li>The nutrition level is high and your stomach feels pleasantly good after eating.  </li>
      <li>Great and could just buy the one thing instead of an entire order as Medifast requires.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>They taste good and seem to keep away hunger for quite a few hours.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get a discount for my troubles, but they did fix the issue fast enough that I received the right product before the delivery window on the original order was done.</li>
      <li>Really tasty.  </li>
      <li>Makes you feel very bloated and gassy after eating.</li>
      <li>Satisfies hunger when there is no time or place for a real meal.  </li>
      <li>They taste more like a dark chocolate bar, and the bottom is dipped in the chocolate.  </li>
      <li>I bought these with the intention of trying them out to see if I could eat the medifast bars before committing to the diet, clearly this doesn&#x27;t serve that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect real chocolate, you can only dream...</li>
      <li>/&gt;update: On the second try, the seller did ship me the right stuff, and it didn&#x27;t end up costing me anything extra.</li>
      <li>I do not recommend eating them first thing in the morning as they don&#x27;t seem as filling on an empty stomach.</li>

    <li> Love the chocolate crunch.  This diet is way too easy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> Great and could just buy the one thing instead of an entire order as Medifast requires.  Good taste and quick to eat.</li>
    <li> They tasted terrible. I couldn&#x27;t even give them away. No one liked the taste and I belong to an exercise class where everyone is on a diet.</li>
    <li> I lost 22 pounds and my husband lost 40 on Medifast and we love this diet.  Only one that has worked for us.</li>
    <li> Price &amp; product were great! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Not terrible...it&#x27;s a diet bar. The mint bar is the best!</li>
    <li> Better than the Peanut Butter Crunch Bars. A lot like the Chocolate Mint Bars, just no mint flavoring. Great midday fuel snack.</li>
    <li> Really tasty.  I measured them today though and just so you are not surprised they are just a bit smaller than a business card. Thicker though. :-)</li>
    <li> They taste good and seem to keep away hunger for quite a few hours. Order arrived quickly, exactly as I expected</li>
    <li> These taste good. However, they give me terrible abdominal pain, bloating. Eating these, I had trouble sleeping and was taking multiple OTC medications for my stomach every day. Since stopping--pain is totally gone. Speaking with my health coach, it is apparently from the sugar alcohols and it is a very common reaction. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are not medifast, these are optifast.  They look nothing like the picture, and the nutritional information is different.  I bought these with the intention of trying them out to see if I could eat the medifast bars before committing to the diet, clearly this doesn&#x27;t serve that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: Seller says it was just a mistake. They are sending me the right stuff, and will pay for that to be shipped, and the shipping to send back the wrong stuff. Will try to update on how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: On the second try, the seller did ship me the right stuff, and it didn&#x27;t end up costing me anything extra. I didn&#x27;t get a discount for my troubles, but they did fix the issue fast enough that I received the right product before the delivery window on the original order was done. So I guess that counts for something.</li>
    <li> Mid morning snack with a glass of water acts as a tasty meal supplement. If you&#x27;re eating four or five small portion meals a day, a crunch bar and a glass of water will act as a small meal. A small very tasty meal. Good when you&#x27;re out and about and don&#x27;t have time to stop and eat.  Don&#x27;t forget the water.</li>
    <li> These are actually my favorite</li>
    <li> The Chocolate Crunch bars are amazing!  I hardly believe they are diet bars.  I have used Medifast products for several months and lost weight.  These are my favorite.  They taste more like a dark chocolate bar, and the bottom is dipped in the chocolate.  They taste especially great if they are a little warm and are great on the go meals.  I usually reserve these towards the end of the day so it feels like a dessert.  I do not recommend eating them first thing in the morning as they don&#x27;t seem as filling on an empty stomach.</li>
    <li> Taste was ok. Nothing special. Makes you feel very bloated and gassy after eating. Make sure to drink water before and after</li>
    <li> Satisfies hunger when there is no time or place for a real meal.  The nutrition level is high and your stomach feels pleasantly good after eating.  It is also helpful in dieting.</li>
    <li> I LIKE chocolate. I got what I wanted when I wanted it. I LIKE CRACKERS. I got what I wanted when I wanted it</li>
    <li> Medifast knows chocolate!  I&#x27;ve lost 80 pounds and counting by using Medifast&#x27;s &amp;#34;5 plus 1&amp;#34; program.  If I can, YOU can!</li>
    <li> These are part of the Medifast plan.  The flavors are descriptive not actual.&lt;br /&gt;I like these bars as part of the plan.  Once you get going on the plan, these are&lt;br /&gt;pretty good.  Don&#x27;t expect real chocolate, you can only dream...</li>
