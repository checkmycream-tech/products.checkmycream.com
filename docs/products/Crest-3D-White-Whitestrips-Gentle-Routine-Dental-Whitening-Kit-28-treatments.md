      <li>I SOO enjoy getting these by mail as people stand in the aisle at stores and don&#x27;t move out of the way it&#x27;s good to know I have more on the way to whiten my teeth and makes me feel better about myself</li>
      <li>I love crest 3D whitestrips</li>
      <li>They are great for sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>and I get many compliments for having nice, white teeth</li>
      <li>Your teeth will absorb the color of those things more right after you bleach them, so you don&#x27;t want to defeat the purpose of the whole production right after you do it. :)</li>
      <li>Just removes very light surface stains, pretty much you can get the same results from a good whitening toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My very first one was in the summer.  </li>
      <li>Works really well!!</li>
      <li>But if you can tolerate the professional strips, get them for a much better result.</li>
      <li>I tried Crest 3D White Strips when it first launched into the marketplace and I love it!  </li>
      <li>You can get some good results when using in combination with other whitening products.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that not everyone has bright white teeth naturally.  </li>
      <li>Some of us have a more creamy white color that we were born with.  </li>
      <li>Gentle Routine doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth!</li>
      <li>would not recommend this product however I would recommend using the regular strips even though it takes more enamel off.</li>
      <li>I think the price doubled since the first time that I purchased it.  </li>
      <li>Since I have been bleaching my teeth for a while before and had the professional trays years ago, I don&#x27;t have too many stains to keep up with, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective these would be for someone just getting started.</li>
      <li>but these really did work.  </li>
      <li>These were really gentle for me to use and do the trick still.</li>
      <li>I do have to say that I don&#x27;t think they did a very noticeable whitening job though.  </li>
      <li>, so I really expected more.  </li>
      <li>The strips are much flimsier; the bottom one seldom goes on straight</li>
      <li>I loved these strips, u must buy it and try it yourself to know what I mean.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m unimpressed and I will be trying the original ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The sensitive teeth formula for Crest Whitestrips was very gentle and didn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity in my teeth.  </li>
      <li>The product really works, it makes the teeth white, it works in a quick period of time, and without damaging the enamel.  </li>
      <li>I gave it more than one star because it did whiten slightly, but, I can&#x27;t use them to find out how well.</li>
      <li>So I bought the gentle routine whitening strips (I got the gentle routine so that my teeth won&#x27;t hurt and it will be sensitive on it.)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>and these did not make them more sensitive at all...like other whitestrips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them many times a see little change.</li>
      <li>I know a lot of people like these, however, these were still too much for my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed as much of a difference with this sensitive version, but my teeth don&#x27;t hurt after using it.</li>
      <li>and I am able to use these everyday with no pain.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t enough, as they are less effective than the professional type strips.  </li>
      <li>If you have very sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>Have very sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>If your teeth are really sensitive, these will help.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>My teeth are sensitive &amp; they haven&#x27;t hurt once</li>
      <li>I got these because they were out of the Professional Effects.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been bleaching my teeth for years, and maybe that&#x27;s how they got so sensitive now.</li>
      <li>Husband loves these for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>My teeth are extremely sensitive and these strips did not cause me any pain whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>However, these are meant to be for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>If your teeth are sensitive, buy some sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>The old down side is that if you want super white you have to get a level 5.</li>
      <li>I first got these, I was ready to get my money back, but after a few wearings I&#x27;ve decided I can cope with the downsides to save the money.  </li>
      <li>I use it for general sensitivity, and even the Pro Effects don&#x27;t cause sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and had no pain or problems and it actually was on my teeth longer than 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>I have been a fan of Crest professional whitening strips for some time, and I didn&#x27;t realize these would be substantially different.</li>
      <li>They recommend only five minutes wear, which I suppose relects the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; nature of these strips.  </li>
      <li>I had to take them off after 4 minutes the first time I used them because I felt a sudden and sharp pang of nerve pain.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know what the other strips are like, but these are a real pain to wear if your mouth produces a lot of saliva as mine does.  </li>
      <li>Results were much more dramatic with the regular version.</li>

<li> Like many of the other reviews suggested, I left them on for 25-30 minutes each day without fail, but four weeks later, I notice only the slightest hint of difference.  </li>
<li> However, my only issue is that the current product seems a little pricey.  </li>
<li> I am kind of disappointed about this.</li>

<li> This product did not whiten my teeth as expected.</li>
<li> but I see absolutely no change in my teeth getting whiter.</li>
<li> I have had this issue with their stronger white strips in the past.</li>
<li> Be very careful handling them.  </li>
<li> I was skeptical that a sensitive product would actually do anything</li>
<li> I think my teeth are a little brighter, but not as much as I expected.  </li>
<li> I used another normal white strip a few weeks ago and it was really painful on my teeth about ten minutes in and had to remove it.</li>
<li> Ordering off the internet is a lot less expensieve than in the stores.&lt;br</li>
<li> A little.  </li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> The Crest \\&quot;Gentle\\&quot; version does not make teeth hurt or be sensitive to heat and cold after treatment, as some formulations do.</li>
<li> and they have worked for me in the past</li>
<li> These are considerably less expensive.  </li>
<li> These also don&#x27;t have a weird flavor that some do and stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> They did slide off my teeth a little &amp; had a nasty taste</li>
<li> and they aren&#x27;t bad for the price.</li>
<li> I was shocked that I didn&#x27;t have shooting pain after wearing these strips.</li>
<li> I was really, really disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Noticed no results. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching my teeth for years, and maybe that&#x27;s how they got so sensitive now. I used another normal white strip a few weeks ago and it was really painful on my teeth about ten minutes in and had to remove it. These were really gentle for me to use and do the trick still. Since I have been bleaching my teeth for a while before and had the professional trays years ago, I don&#x27;t have too many stains to keep up with, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective these would be for someone just getting started. These also don&#x27;t have a weird flavor that some do and stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP FROM MY DENTIST TO REMEMBER- Just don&#x27;t drink coffee or red wine 24 hours after you bleach. Your teeth will absorb the color of those things more right after you bleach them, so you don&#x27;t want to defeat the purpose of the whole production right after you do it. :)</li>
    <li> I ordered the strips because a friend told me to use them, I don&#x27;t think they work all that well. I&#x27;ve used them many times a see little change.</li>
    <li> Item received as described and in a timely matter.</li>
    <li> Husband loves these for sensitive teeth. They work!</li>
    <li> Work great. Only 5 minutes at a time. My teeth are sensitive &amp; they haven&#x27;t hurt once and they aren&#x27;t bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have yellow teeth but there is a tint of yellow. So I bought the gentle routine whitening strips (I got the gentle routine so that my teeth won&#x27;t hurt and it will be sensitive on it.) I love crest 3D whitestrips and they have worked for me in the past but after 3 weeks the only thing it did for me was take off the yellowness (I brush my teeth 2x a day) and my teeth still are not white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product however I would recommend using the regular strips even though it takes more enamel off.</li>
    <li> Ordering off the internet is a lot less expensieve than in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;It is convenient and not a hassle to order off the internet.</li>
    <li> Loved it...only wish it whitened a lot faster....although I guess it&#x27;s according to the severity of your teeth.  Works really well!!</li>
    <li> I have tried using other Whitestrips and found out that I have sensitive teeth so I tried these. They are great for sensitive teeth but I see absolutely no change in my teeth getting whiter. I am kind of disappointed about this.</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; price beats everything else I have found, including sales/coupons at CVS and Walgreen&#x27;s.  The Crest \\&quot;Gentle\\&quot; version does not make teeth hurt or be sensitive to heat and cold after treatment, as some formulations do.</li>
    <li> Keeps the ivories looking white with a minimum of effort!</li>
    <li> Like many of the other reviews suggested, I left them on for 25-30 minutes each day without fail, but four weeks later, I notice only the slightest hint of difference.  I also use whitening toothpaste, I brush twice a day, and I don&#x27;t drink soda/coffee, etc., so I really expected more.  Overall, I&#x27;m unimpressed and I will be trying the original ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t know what the other strips are like, but these are a real pain to wear if your mouth produces a lot of saliva as mine does.  I basically had to put them in and not talk or move my mouth the entire time, or they would shift around or slide off altogether, the bottom ones especially.</li>
    <li> Whitens teeth with no pain.  I love it!  I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just put it on for an hour and take it off &amp; it&#x27;s a shade whiter.</li>
    <li> These are great! I have sensitive teeth and I am able to use these everyday with no pain. I will definitely order another box of these to use periodically.</li>
    <li> I got these because they were out of the Professional Effects.  At first I hated them because they are flimsy, and easy to mess up/fold even before putting them in.  After a couple tries, I got it figured out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Be very careful handling them.  They aren&#x27;t sturdy strips like the Pro Effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I use them for 30 minutes, and yes, you can&#x27;t talk a lot while they&#x27;re in, or the bottom ones will move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  If your teeth are sensitive, buy some sensitive toothpaste.  I use it for general sensitivity, and even the Pro Effects don&#x27;t cause sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Try not to overlap the strips onto your gums, as they can get irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got these, I was ready to get my money back, but after a few wearings I&#x27;ve decided I can cope with the downsides to save the money.  These are considerably less expensive.  I don&#x27;t know how well they&#x27;d work with the suggested 5 minute routine, but I&#x27;m seeing good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second whitening.  My very first one was in the summer.  I had decades of staining to remove, and white strips work well.  Keep in mind that not everyone has bright white teeth naturally.  Some of us have a more creamy white color that we were born with.  That said, my friends noticed and complimented my white teeth.  One of them went out and bought them for herself.</li>
    <li> If you have very sensitive teeth like I do, this still causes a lot of pain, even after only 5 min of use.  The pain comes after about 5 uses then it becomes unbearable.</li>
    <li> It does whiten the teeth.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, great price.....</li>
    <li> This strips don&#x27;t work too well for darkish or deeper stains. Just removes very light surface stains, pretty much you can get the same results from a good whitening toothpaste. You can get some good results when using in combination with other whitening products.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that a sensitive product would actually do anything but these really did work.  My teeth are extremely sensitive and these strips did not cause me any pain whatsoever.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing service and product.</li>
    <li> very easy to use, I basically use it in the shower so it was very easy to integrate into a routine, seems to be working</li>
    <li> These worked wonderful! I loved them. No pain, nothing. They did slide off my teeth a little &amp; had a nasty taste but they did the job.</li>
    <li> Got these for my wife at her request. She loves them. Started seeing results after only three uses.</li>
    <li> This product does work. The old down side is that if you want super white you have to get a level 5. I have sensitive teeth and had no pain or problems and it actually was on my teeth longer than 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I loved these strips, u must buy it and try it yourself to know what I mean. In shortm worth the price!!! (5 stars)</li>
    <li> They do not stay in place and I will not order them again.</li>
    <li> I always purchase these through amazon because they are cheaper than anywhere else I have looked.  I use them every other day because I have sensitive teeth.  I always receive compliments on how white my teeth look.</li>
    <li> I did not buy these on Amazon, I bought them at Target. However, I figured I would write a review. I know a lot of people like these, however, these were still too much for my sensitive teeth. I had to take them off after 4 minutes the first time I used them because I felt a sudden and sharp pang of nerve pain. I have had this issue with their stronger white strips in the past. However, these are meant to be for sensitive teeth. I gave it more than one star because it did whiten slightly, but, I can&#x27;t use them to find out how well. I was really, really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Gentle Routine doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth! I was shocked that I didn&#x27;t have shooting pain after wearing these strips. Painless whitening!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Crest professional whitening strips for some time, and I didn&#x27;t realize these would be substantially different. The strips are much flimsier; the bottom one seldom goes on straight and they slide around on my teeth.  They recommend only five minutes wear, which I suppose relects the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; nature of these strips.  It isn&#x27;t enough, as they are less effective than the professional type strips.  If your teeth are really sensitive, these will help.  A little.  But if you can tolerate the professional strips, get them for a much better result.</li>
    <li> The sensitive teeth formula for Crest Whitestrips was very gentle and didn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity in my teeth.  I do have to say that I don&#x27;t think they did a very noticeable whitening job though.  After 23 of the 28 days, I&#x27;m still staring in the mirror trying to decide if there is any improvement.  I think my teeth are a little brighter, but not as much as I expected.  Results were much more dramatic with the regular version.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, works perfectly an it DOES whiten your teeth as it says.  My daughter uses them and she loves them.</li>
    <li> I tried Crest 3D White Strips when it first launched into the marketplace and I love it!  The product really works, it makes the teeth white, it works in a quick period of time, and without damaging the enamel.  However, my only issue is that the current product seems a little pricey.  I think the price doubled since the first time that I purchased it.  It&#x27;s a good product and I would recommend it but shop around for a good price.</li>
    <li> I SOO enjoy getting these by mail as people stand in the aisle at stores and don&#x27;t move out of the way it&#x27;s good to know I have more on the way to whiten my teeth and makes me feel better about myself</li>
    <li> Great! No sensitivity and somewhat effective.</li>
    <li> Have very sensitive teeth and these did not make them more sensitive at all...like other whitestrips.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed as much of a difference with this sensitive version, but my teeth don&#x27;t hurt after using it.</li>
    <li> I purchase this item about every couple of months to maintain white teeth.  It works great for me and I get many compliments for having nice, white teeth</li>
    <li> This product did not whiten my teeth as expected.</li>
