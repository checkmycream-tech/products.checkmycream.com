      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>the quality is okay.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off just buying a pair from your corner drugstore like CVS or Rite Aid.</li>
      <li>Also, it took all most a month to receive.</li>
      <li>These are pretty good.</li>
      <li>Not bad for a buck or so!</li>
      <li>and they grab a hair just fine too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly as described and the presentation was cute.</li>
      <li>The tips are about .5cm wide which is good for most applications.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at the quality and performance, and you certainly won&#x27;t find a better value for the price anywhere.</li>

      <li>Shipping took a really long time but its a fine product.</li>
      <li>Cheap, just like the price, as expected.</li>

      <li>Low price for a reasonable tweezer!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any complaints so far.</li>
      <li>I like these Eyebrow Tweezers, but they are a little pointed at the tips, and I am use to the flat slanted tip, which seems to make it easier to get the hair out easy.</li>
      <li>The first time I went to use this it broke in half.</li>
      <li>One of the order-and-forget items that shows up randomly a few weeks later and becomes a fun surprise.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These tweezers have a nice grip and solid metal frame. It does not easily slip from the hand, no matter what the size.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give these five stars simply because they feel so flimsy and I expect they will not stay in alignment and become unusable in short order.</li>
    <li> I like these Eyebrow Tweezers, but they are a little pointed at the tips, and I am use to the flat slanted tip, which seems to make it easier to get the hair out easy. I would recommend these tweezers to anyone who likes the tip pointed ends these have.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work, threw them out. Company got them shipped fast though</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever they get the finest hair excellent seller. You can&#x27;t beat the price buy several!!!!</li>
    <li> the tweezers grip ever little hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived before time, but they took a long time to arrive though. It&#x27;s exactly as described and the presentation was cute. They gave me mine with two cute little things that seems to look like rubber bands at the tip of each tweezers to enclosed them that was nice. They look sharp but I haven&#x27;t used them yet so I wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> well what can you say about tweezers? they tweeze</li>
    <li> These are pretty good. They line up when closed unlike others I have purchased in store from other brands.</li>
    <li> Low price for a reasonable tweezer!</li>
    <li> Very Unsatisfied!! Tweezers came with RUSTY tip! .. GROSS!!  .. U N S A F E!!! Infection waiting to happen--threw OUT!!! ..</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner then expected. I&#x27;m really pleased with this product. Looks just like the picture and even comes with heart shaped bands around the tips. Neatly packed and wasn&#x27;t damaged at all. They do the job. I don&#x27;t have any complaints so far.</li>
    <li> I like the price, just wish it did what it&#x27;s supposed to. The blades are too sharp. Cuts the hair before it can be plucked.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase these tweezers thinking the low price was too good to be true. I was amazed at the quality and performance, and you certainly won&#x27;t find a better value for the price anywhere. I would purchase again, but doubt there will be any need as I expect these to last.</li>
    <li> It clips more than pulls my hair out.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; the hair</li>
    <li> I hate to give bad reviews but I had to speak out on these tweezers. Unfortunately, they cannot pluck anything to save anyone&#x27;s life. It is that bad, plus you&#x27;d have to wait for weeks to receive your order because of the company&#x27;s international location. You&#x27;re better off just buying a pair from your corner drugstore like CVS or Rite Aid.</li>
    <li> Does it come with one or two tweezers?</li>
    <li> These were the worst purchase I ever made at Amazon. I had to wait for 4 weeks or longer before they arrived. Plus, they were extremely flimsy.</li>
    <li> Too sharp, they cut hairs instead of gripping them.</li>
    <li> great received before they were suppose to be hear</li>
    <li> After waiting a month to get these, they were NOT straight tip.  Both pair were slanted tip. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> these were the best that i was able to find anywhere around town or on the internet. these work great... for me for what i use them for. and they grab a hair just fine too. the quality is okay. they are thin but they sure do work good. they will pull a hair. they will pull a splinter out. they will pull a tiny thorn or sticker out of my dog&#x27;s foot too. i got them for a good price too on prime.</li>
    <li> you must try these to see, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find the old fashion kind like I&#x27;ve had for so long but it finally broke.  And, yup, these were them.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> The first time I went to use this it broke in half. Thin and cheap metal. Very, very cheaply made. Also, it took all most a month to receive.</li>
    <li> Work well. Good value for two tweezers.</li>
    <li> Super cheap, and exactly what they need to be. It&#x27;s also fun because shipping is slow (but free), and nobody is in a rush for these. One of the order-and-forget items that shows up randomly a few weeks later and becomes a fun surprise.</li>
    <li> kinda slippery. doesn&#x27;t grasp well.</li>
    <li> Work great- can&#x27;t beat the price thanks</li>
    <li> Cheap, just like the price, as expected.</li>
    <li> Love them! Exactly what I wanted,  but I am a bit confused because I read someone only got one but I got two like it said which was great! They are very sharp and get all the little hairs perfectly</li>
    <li> comes in a pair and a little knob to keep the ends together and extremely affordable!! :D</li>
    <li> Shipping took a really long time but its a fine product. The tips are about .5cm wide which is good for most applications.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t grip any hairs, totally worthless. They took forever to arrive, too.</li>
    <li> You can get this same quality of tweezer at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> The day before the expected date of birth before this - great job. Their shape well, spikes, so good, I bought some used to be boring. Great quality, good price, good fast delivery ...... highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not bad for a buck or so!</li>
    <li> So cheap I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Try and find a better deal</li>
    <li> So so tweezers.  A bit on the weak side</li>
