### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone who needs a Blade.</li>
      <li>Oster just make the best out there..</li>
      <li>If you want a nice close cut, these are great!  </li>
      <li>Great purchase.</li>
      <li>Works great when using the step procedure.</li>
      <li>I got a great deal</li>
      <li>Great inbetween for a fade.</li>
      <li>This blade compliments a wonderful, and wonderfully precise machine.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good with it</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and in good shape but they advertise the AgION collection which is no longer produced.  </li>
      <li>Great product in a new case, nice in oily and works great, haven&#x27;t had any complaints from my customers.</li>
      <li>When I bought the Oster Classic 76 it came with the 000 clipper blade which is an awesome blade</li>
      <li>I needed a new Clipper Blade for my machine so I searched the Internet for the best price and found it.</li>
      <li>Not a terrible device for around $50, but just doesn&#x27;t give an even trim.</li>
      <li>Facial stubble that looks like perfect one day growth.</li>
      <li>Iam pleased.</li>
      <li>The picture is a lie, make sure you do not get screwed.</li>
      <li>I think it is easier and quicker to cut with this blade than the 000, feels like I don&#x27;t have to go over my head as many times.  </li>
      <li>Although most trimmers may cut lower than the 0000 blade, I like the fact that I can have a blend between the trimmer and the  000 blade.</li>
      <li>This came super fast and blade came in a oily state which is a good sign of its good condition.</li>
      <li>pretty good for skin fades and baldies.</li>
      <li>but they cut pretty good.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s surprising how much it takes off.</li>
      <li>Got this as part of a set of barber tools and it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>Great, solid product and</li>
      <li>But so far so good.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a super short buzz cut or to fade with , this is a great blade to have in your set.  </li>
      <li>I got this item on time and thats the only good thing.</li>
      <li>Oster may have been the best clipper company in the past, but now Wahl and Andis have caught up with new technology advancements.</li>
      <li>it shipped very fast.</li>
      <li>I am not mad, but the price for the Oster Agion Professional Blade was much more than Oster Professional Blade.</li>
      <li>Exactly the length I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>this blade gives a very close cut to go a long with my 000 size Oster blade; top quality blade.</li>
      <li>so I will be more careful.</li>
      <li>but time is scarce and for a fellow who likes a very close buzz cut and does not want to clip his hair every 3 days I needed something closer.</li>
      <li>I use my Classic 76 to trim my Shih Tzu&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>Keep it clean and oiled and it will give you a long time in service.</li>
      <li>Cuts my hair to absolutely the right length, it&#x27;s well made and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>After 15 years I needed a new blade.</li>
      <li>The blade is scratched up as well and its in a new package?</li>
      <li>I would only recommend being careful if you have sensitive skin since the points are semi-lethal :).</li>
      <li>Not sure why Amazon allows this deception to persist but with a name like Cavetus Emtore you would think I would know better, oh well.</li>
      <li>It is a little more closer than the last one</li>
      <li>This blade is great for cutting bald fades.</li>
      <li>The detachable clipper I have is the Andis BGRC which does an great job at cutting my hair.</li>
      <li>I was going to return it, but decided to keep it for those times I am in a rush, and for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Oster #0000 today, and wow, what a difference.</li>
      <li>and I needed a blade that cuts as close as a professional trimmer.</li>
      <li>If this was a Oster Agion Blade it would print Agion Collection on the blade and the labeling on the manufacturer&#x27;s box would advertise Oster Agion Professional, not Oster Professional.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting these for nearly 10 years.</li>
      <li>I will not buy the rest to complete my set from these liars.</li>
      <li>I order the Oster Agion Professional Blade and was sent the regular Oster Professional Blade instead.</li>
      <li>I picked the Andis BGRC because the clipper was small and light, unlike the heavy old school Oster 76 that I will carry to my grave.</li>

    <li> If you want a nice close cut, these are great!  I was using the 000 and even though these only cut a little shorter it&#x27;s surprising how much it takes off.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a super short buzz cut or to fade with , this is a great blade to have in your set.  I was using the Size 000, blade and wanted something a little shorter for an all over buzz cut.  The Size 0000 fits the bill, now I only cut my hair about every 5-6 days instead of 3-4.  I think it is easier and quicker to cut with this blade than the 000, feels like I don&#x27;t have to go over my head as many times.  Would definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d previously bought a Norelco stubble trimmer that cuts to .5mm. Not a terrible device for around $50, but just doesn&#x27;t give an even trim. I was going to return it, but decided to keep it for those times I am in a rush, and for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Oster #0000 today, and wow, what a difference. Facial stubble that looks like perfect one day growth. Exactly the length I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also fully buzz my head. For that, I use the #000 that comes with the Oster 76 Classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Cuts with precision. I&#x27;ve been wanting these for nearly 10 years. I finally bought the Oster 76 and these to go along with them. Something I should have done 10 years ago. Don&#x27;t do what I did and sporadically check ebay looking at them and imagining cutting with them. JUST DO IT! get them</li>
    <li> The picture is a lie, make sure you do not get screwed.I end up paying for something I do not want. Seller Lied multiple times</li>
    <li> This came super fast and blade came in a oily state which is a good sign of its good condition. Iam pleased.</li>
    <li> I use a number 2 blade for for my head and this 0000 for trimming my neck. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;Blade arrived after only 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;Kurt</li>
    <li> I order the Oster Agion Professional Blade and was sent the regular Oster Professional Blade instead. I am not mad, but the price for the Oster Agion Professional Blade was much more than Oster Professional Blade. The blade does cut lower than the 000 blade and I needed a blade that cuts as close as a professional trimmer. The detachable clipper I have is the Andis BGRC which does an great job at cutting my hair. I picked the Andis BGRC because the clipper was small and light, unlike the heavy old school Oster 76 that I will carry to my grave. Oster may have been the best clipper company in the past, but now Wahl and Andis have caught up with new technology advancements. Although most trimmers may cut lower than the 0000 blade, I like the fact that I can have a blend between the trimmer and the  000 blade. The 000 blade cuts at .50 mm and the 0000 blade cuts at .25 mm.  Professional trimmers usually cuts between a (Andis Outliner detachable blade) 000000 blade at .1mm  and a (Oster or Andis detachable blade) 00000 blade at .2mm. If this was a Oster Agion Blade it would print Agion Collection on the blade and the labeling on the manufacturer&#x27;s box would advertise Oster Agion Professional, not Oster Professional.</li>
    <li> Cuts my hair to absolutely the right length, it&#x27;s well made and lasts a long time. Keep it clean and oiled and it will give you a long time in service. Oster blades are the only ones I&#x27;ll use these days. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> pretty good for skin fades and baldies. i think if you are using this, you should just switch to the trimmers. but they cut pretty good.</li>
    <li> I use the clippers but they&#x27;re not Agion!</li>
    <li> I use my Classic 76 to trim my Shih Tzu&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s the only clipper I found that will do the job. After 15 years I needed a new blade. I got this one. It is a little more closer than the last one so I will be more careful. But so far so good. But they still don&#x27;t like getting their hair done. I give it a five star woof. They just give it an ugly stare.</li>
    <li> When I bought the Oster Classic 76 it came with the 000 clipper blade which is an awesome blade but time is scarce and for a fellow who likes a very close buzz cut and does not want to clip his hair every 3 days I needed something closer. I considered the 00000 blade but after reading some reviews decided to go with this 0000 blade instead. Just what I needed. Now I only cut every 5 days so it does save me time. Great, solid product and it shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> Got this as part of a set of barber tools and it works just fine.  Have used it to cut my grandkids hair.</li>
    <li> I needed a new Clipper Blade for my machine so I searched the Internet for the best price and found it.I got a great deal and I&#x27;m very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone who needs a Blade.</li>
    <li> This blade is great for cutting bald fades. Use for taking out #000 lines. Works great when using the step procedure.</li>
    <li> I got this item on time and thats the only good thing. This is a used item. There was HAIR on it!!! The blade is scratched up as well and its in a new package? WTH!!! I will not buy the rest to complete my set from these liars.</li>
    <li> Oster just make the best out there..</li>
    <li> Great inbetween for a fade.Depends on how tight your fade is so....mines...tight!</li>
    <li> Product I received is NOT agION as described and pictured. I would not have ordered it if I knew this. Deceptive seller post and description. Zero stars. Im required to enter at least 1 star to post.</li>
    <li> Great product in a new case, nice in oily and works great, haven&#x27;t had any complaints from my customers. I didn&#x27;t even know this&#x27;d</li>
    <li> Not sure if I should be hung-up on the fact that this product is presented (read:pictured and described as) having a silver-based antimicrobial coating (&amp;#34;Agion&amp;#34;) and then being delivered a different product (sans silver antimicrobial coating) but it does cut my hair. Not sure why Amazon allows this deception to persist but with a name like Cavetus Emtore you would think I would know better, oh well.</li>
    <li> This blade compliments a wonderful, and wonderfully precise machine.  I would only recommend being careful if you have sensitive skin since the points are semi-lethal :).</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in good shape but they advertise the AgION collection which is no longer produced.  I thought thats what I was getting but I got the regular style.  They explained this to me and I&#x27;m good with it but they need to change the picture.</li>
    <li> this blade gives a very close cut to go a long with my 000 size Oster blade; top quality blade.</li>
