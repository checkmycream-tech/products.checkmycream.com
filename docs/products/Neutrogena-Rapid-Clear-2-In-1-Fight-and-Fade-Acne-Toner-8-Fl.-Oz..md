      <li>These strong astringents are great as aftershave as they tend to contain alcohol and thusly help prevent your skin from getting infected.</li>
      <li>Its been amazing.</li>
      <li>Amazing product..</li>
      <li>Amazingly, it has done just that.  </li>
      <li>It is simply an amazing product for my skin.</li>
      <li>I believe the toner was effective in the \\&quot;fight\\&quot; aspect, as well-- from examining the cotton balls of toner</li>

      <li>a nice benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but its just really nice to use in the morning after I cleanse my face and before bed</li>
      <li>Now my face is clear and flawless!</li>
      <li>This is by far, the best toner I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see amazing results from using it, but it does an okay job of cleaning the face.  </li>
      <li>That was effective, this latest replacement gave me a rash</li>

      <li>We are satisfied with the product :)</li>

      <li>I love this stuff and use it every day.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t need concealer on most of them.</li>
      <li>My complexion has gotten so much better.</li>
      <li>Thank you! : )</li>
      <li>Iam in love with this product.</li>
      <li>It seems to be a bit more drying than the Proactiv formula</li>
      <li>My forehead (Where the shingles breakouts occurred) looks so much better.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re skin will be more susceptible to getting burnt by the sun using this product.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly on my shoulders and arms</li>
      <li>so glad it&#x27;s on amazon.</li>
      <li>Nice clean scent.</li>
      <li>It works better and is more affordable, plus it doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical odor, which Proactiv does.</li>
      <li>Really keeps my acne under good control.</li>
      <li>If your looking for a toner that&#x27;s easy on the skin</li>
      <li>I am consistent in use of this product I can go without make-up because my face really glows beautifully.     </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is strong</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t mind how strong it is.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten used to the sting, but sometimes it is quite strong (ie, after getting my eyebrows waxed).</li>
      <li>and you should be fine.</li>
      <li>Does a great job in relatively fast amount of time when consistently used.</li>
      <li>I waited until I&#x27;d used it 5 times but honestly, after the first time my skin was already so clear and bright.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Rapid Clear is perfect for my very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have been sensitive, very fair, combination skin (usually very oily) and</li>
      <li>I had a huge blister on my cheek which I thought it was a gigantic cystic acne lump, but it was a blister.</li>
      <li>It gives energy to my skin, my face seems healthy and feels fresh</li>
      <li>This product makes my skin smooth and have an almost matte look.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using it for a while and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I still have about 3/4 of a bottle left and have been using it almost every day for about a month. This product goes a long way, but I don&#x27;t see it helping. Does not help in 8 hours. I am a fan of Neutrogena products but not satisfied with this one in particular.</li>
    <li> This product is designed to replace the Proactiv regimen I&#x27;ve been using for years.  With the three steps of Neutrogena, they work well and keep the skin clear but admittedly not leaving as clean and fresh a feeling as Proactiv.  I do not see any major new breakouts and consequently no fading is required.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and I received it without a seal. It came in a big box, and half of the product had spilled out. I should have purchased this product in store whereas I know that a seal would have been on the bottle. I am very disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about buying skin medication to remove blemishes since I have not had much luck in the past.  This product however worked very well and removed some scars within a couple weeks.  Thanks Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> This item contains salicylic acid AND glycolic acid, which both can help speep up exfoliation. They should put that on the bottle that glycolic acid is added because this stuff is pretty strong but for me, since I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it did what is says. It worked to fade away post acne marks and reduce the size of my pimples quickly. I admit I wasn&#x27;t consistent with using it (once a day instead of twice a day, and sometimes not even every day). But in 3 weeks my dark brown acne marks (i have medium olive skin tone) faded to a caramel color and I don&#x27;t need concealer on most of them. This may not be right for sensitive skin, however. Also I have keratosis pilaris on my legs and am now using it for that purpose. my dermo thinks it&#x27;s a great idea. It&#x27;s beeen only a couple of days and it&#x27;s already working. I just need to moisturize afterwards.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have a problem with after acne marks and this is supposed to help that. The day after I used it my face actually broke out with acne and my hand that came in contact with the product is peeling awfully.  I don&#x27;t know anyone else who has used the product to know if the same thing happened, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it in case it does happen to them.  Definitely didn&#x27;t reduce the swelling, size or redness of the breakout in 8 hours either like the bottle says.  In fact its been 3 days and they&#x27;re the same as they were when I broke out.</li>
    <li> I just went through a bottle and I notice that my acne scars have disappeared quite a bit. I did not use the toner consistently (I may have only used it once a day), so I probably would have seen faster/more effective results if I had used it twice a day, as part of my skin care regimen. The toner didn&#x27;t over-dry my skin or make it sensitive as long as I only used it my two times a day. This was the only fade product I used during that time. I believe the toner was effective in the \\&quot;fight\\&quot; aspect, as well-- from examining the cotton balls of toner I had wiped my face with, I could tell it was cleaning leftover make-up and dirt from my face that my cleanser left behind. My skin stayed clean, my acne cleared up, and my scars faded all while using this toner.</li>
    <li> This toner takes a looot of dirt (you can see it in the cotton ball) compared to Thayers Rose Petal Toner so I tend to use the Neutrogena especially if I was out the whole day.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for a week and I already noticed a difference in my skin. Ive gotten so many compliments on my skin ever since I started using this!</li>
    <li> I love this toner. Its no miracle liquid, but it does make your acne and skin less red. I have nodular cystic acne that covers about 20-30 percent of my face so this probably isn&#x27;t going to help much but its just really nice to use in the morning after I cleanse my face and before bed right after I remove all of my make up. If you have mild to little acne, this will be perfect for you. But always remember to use an oil free moisturizer right after applying this toner because it can be very drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.&lt;br /&gt;I used Clinique&#x27;s Acne Solutions Clarifying Lotion toner ($14 bucks) before this and the Neutrogena rapid clear works just as well if not better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 and still have acne, so I&#x27;ve been around the block when it comes to products, but there aren&#x27;t many I care much for. I bought this one because it was on sale for dirt cheap, and I was looking for a way to get rid of some acne redness/scarring. Now, obviously it can&#x27;t do much to get rid of the actual texture of your skin, but when it comes to getting rid of the redness and the swelling, it actually works VERY well for me, on both old acne marks and current, swelled up, active acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy, so I don&#x27;t really know (or rather, care) too much about the correct way to use \\&quot;toner\\&quot; also, I&#x27;m kinda lazy, so I don&#x27;t use it twice a day, or even once a day for that matter. But when I do, I use it before bed and find that my skin (specifically my acne) doesn&#x27;t look as red and obnoxious the next morning. Everyone&#x27;s skin is definitely not the same, but this product alone does a far better job than the full Proactiv set ever did for me (and I actually stuck to that routine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, give it a shot. It&#x27;s not that expensive. And who knows? Maybe it&#x27;s the 1 product you can stick with from now on.</li>
    <li> This product worked for me. I am 38 years old.  Every skin type is different. I have sensitive skin and break out with certain products but I did not with this one. It took me about a week to notice my face was brighter. It is a product that must be used consistently for it to work. If I stop using it I notice my face looks darker with circles and marks. But when I continue to use it, it lightens again. It makes my skin feel fresh and awake. I really enjoy this product and plan to buy another. I had one bottle so far and it lasted me a couple months. This is because I used it off and on.</li>
    <li> I pair this along with the rapid clear Fade Gel and Cleanser, and my skin looks amazing. Blemishes are gone and my face is always clean. I love this. However, if you scrub your face raw, let your skin rest before you put this on, as it is high in salicylic acid, which really does burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t too strong but the aroma can burn your eyes once your first start using it.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with toners forever! My skin has freckles and acne scars. I am in my late 20s and coming out of a battle with acne. I have tried a vast majority of products on the market. Including, Proactive, Acne Free, Obagi, just to name a few. My sensitive skin was not fond of any products listed. This toner is a great product! I use it after cleaning my face with THE WAVE and have noticed my skin clear up drastically!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*You want a toner without alcohol, as it will dry skin out &amp; lead to early wrinkles. I avoid alcohol in all my skincare choices. Aveda botanical toner, and neutrogena alcohol free toner are products I have used in the past and was also happy with.</li>
    <li> wanna rant about alcohol in all salycilic acid products...it dries the skin too much and for some reason i cannot find any products that are alcohol free.</li>
    <li> I suffer from acne occassionaly,which leaves scar.I am darskined so getting rid of hyperpigmented scars is a challenge.This product helps speed up the lightening of the scars with the use of other topical treatments.My skin is healing faster than ever,and my breakouts aren&#x27;t as frequent.Iam in love with this product.My skin loves this stuff.My skin type is combination. I combine this product with the acne spot gel fight and fade and Iam seeing beautiful glowing skin emerge.This stuff is very effective.</li>
    <li> I have mild acne all over my face and I used this product almost every night and I didn&#x27;t cleanse my face before using at times and it works. My pimples dried and vanished. Post acne marks are still there but are fading. This product is awesome after trying many acne products this is the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over 50 and have had mild acne since my teens. I have not used this for very long, but it seems to work very well. This toner is very strong and I wash it off my fingertips so they won&#x27;t dry out. It does fade the post-acne marks pretty quickly. My face looks much better after using this a short time. It is quickly reducing some hardened little whiteheads. Those are very difficult to get rid of, and I thought I&#x27;d have to let the dermatologist remove them; but they are shrinking down. I use a cotton round to apply it, and I really work it into my skin. Still, it isn&#x27;t too drying for me. I also like to apply it with the texturized, exfoliating rounds--especially the problem areas. I know that it will reduce breakouts fast, but I haven&#x27;t found whether or not it will prevent them.  I plan to continue use to see if it will prevent blackheads from forming on my nose and the occasional cysts on my chin. I think it will at least help a great deal. But there is the \\&quot;purging period\\&quot; of a few weeks, when all the little infections are rising to the surface; during that time, the face looks much worse, but it is getting better! At first it might over-dry, especially for anyone with sensitive skin; so I&#x27;d go lightly with it at first. (If your skin gets too dry, take a little break and use a moisturizer that won&#x27;t aggravate acne. I like the Neutrogena hand cream for all over my skin, including eyelids, chapped lips &amp; nose.) Don&#x27;t get the toner on the edges of your lips, because the taste is hard to get rid of. If your face is not too sensitive, I think you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, fast shipping &amp; price!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t real sure about this product- bought many other products around the same time that claimed to fade acne scars. So far, this is the only one I&#x27;ve stuck to, and it seems to work well. Noticed changes within two days, which is pretty fast compared to other products. But, you can&#x27;t expect it to fix all your dark spots or scars immediately. Takes time, unfortunately, but it definitely reduced my break outs! I use three times a day (if I remember).</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and bought this out of desperation. My makeup usually slides off my oil slick within a couple hours after washing my face. It&#x27;s awful! This toner is great, though. My makeup will last about six hours after using it. It&#x27;s slightly drying, but for me that&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems as though my adult acne (sheesh, I&#x27;m 41--enough already!) has improved since I started using it a couple weeks ago. I can&#x27;t comment on the claim that it fades dark spots since I haven&#x27;t been using it enough. Honestly, though, even if it doesn&#x27;t, its other properties are enough for me to give this five stars!</li>
    <li> I started using this product and it , helped my skin . it stops breakout before they even begin. This is really a great product, \\&quot;THANK U NEUTROGENA\\&quot;, for this its wonderful</li>
    <li> I bought this toner to try something new to get rid of my acne scars &amp; prevent new bouts of pimples from recurring on my face. It worked wonderfully for fighting the pimples- I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month, and I have not had ONE new pimple since using it. However, I have not seen any significant difference in the scarring as far as the \\&quot;fading\\&quot; aspect of the product. Hopefully, my skin is just stubborn and I need to use it a little longer, but this is a bit disappointing. It&#x27;s a great product otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also- It does sting if you have tiny cuts or open pores on your face. I&#x27;ve gotten used to the sting, but sometimes it is quite strong (ie, after getting my eyebrows waxed).</li>
    <li> I waited 2 weeks before I wrote this review because I wanted to ensure it was actually the toner that was clearing my skin. This product has really helped me, within two days my pimples shrunk, and my skin is noticeably less oily. It may dry your skin a bit on the first day but by the second and third its fine. I have noticed that spots on my face from previous pimples are also gradually disappearing. This is an added benefit for my skin.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says it does and works&lt;br /&gt;as well as all their Rapid Clear products. If you have sensitive skin and want clear skin, this&lt;br /&gt;is a really good product to try.</li>
    <li> I had no issues with this product or with the seller.  It worked okay.  It&#x27;s nothing spectacular, but every product works different on different people.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Neutrogena Stress Control Toner for a while now, and recently ran out.  I decided to go a head and give this one a try instead, since I am facing cystic acne scaring.  I am glad I did.  I really love my previous toner, but I think I like this one even more.  I have only been using this for a few days, and my skin seems to be reacting well to it.  I have seen a difference in the tone of my skin and my scars.</li>
    <li> Great for clearing up acne scars. I had a new scar and it cleared it up within a month of using this twice a day. Also my old scars cleared up within 2 to 3 months. They slowly fade away and make your skin look great. Great product and the results were better than expected.</li>
    <li> The old formula was great but this new one gave me a rash! I tried to get a hold of the old formula in store, on their website and online; no luck. That was effective, this latest replacement gave me a rash and I can&#x27;t even return it. O</li>
    <li> This is by far, the best toner I have ever used.  I started using this product because I started getting acne and all the other products that I tried yielded absolutely no results.  It visibly reduces acne and as claimed, fights and fades.  The results are visible within a week of the first application but felt immediately.  The first time you use this product, you feel the difference on your skin.  I highly recommend this to fight breakouts.  I must however, stress the importance of sticking with the entire line of products... the results are guaranteed!  The Oil Free Acne Wash Facial Cleanser and Oil Free Moisturizer are highly recommended by me to be used in conjunction with this product.</li>
    <li> wahhhh i hate leaving bad reviews! but unfortunately i have to!...well i was hoping that this product would help me with my old acne scars and help me with my new unexpected extreme breakout but if anything it made it worse!!!! however i think the only reason was because of my extremely!!!!!! oily skin!!! this product made me even more oily which caused me to have an even worse breakout! i would recommend this product to people with really oily skin but if you dont have oily skin than i say go for it! i pray it works for you</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work at all</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and this product really helped me. My face was clear in only 1 week. I love it. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This did not reduce my dark spots as advertised, but its a nice cleanser.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any luck with this, perhaps I was impatient. The first couple of days of using this as directed, I had a break out of huge whiteheads. On the other hand, it wasn&#x27;t expensive.  Also, it kinda made my skin glow in a way.</li>
    <li> The product was just as we expected and we liked to use it. We are satisfied with the product :)</li>
    <li> Amazing product.. people who are suffering from acne problems... believe me u wont have this problem again</li>
    <li> It DOES work. My face started to clear up within a week. No other product works like this one does.</li>
    <li> I tend to have break-outs every once in a while and I&#x27;ll admit that I am a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34;.  Well, I got this to maybe help me get rid of the ugly dark spots but I must say that this is a let-down.  The label states that it will start working after 8 hours of it being applied.  I mean really?!?  Who, with breakouts, goes 8 hours without washing their face?</li>
    <li> So I bought this stuff after reading an article on Pinterest that it would help clear acne scars.  Amazingly, it has done just that.  I had some scars on one side of my face that have been pretty stubborn.  Slowly they have faded over the last month.  I am shocked.  Not only does it do a great job with clearing up old acne scars, its been doing a pretty darn good job with keeping my face clear!  Now, it does say on the bottle to not apply anything after its application.  However, its pretty drying and I just couldn&#x27;t do it.  I do apply a light moisturizer afterwards. . but I haven&#x27;t had any problems doing so.  Its been amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST toner I have ever used. Proactive does not even come close to the magic that is within this bottle. I saw immediate results the first night. I use to have clear skin, but my sophomore year of college I broke out terribly. Ive been SEARCHING for a miracle. I found out about this product on youtube and I am so glad I did. I have been using this product for only a week and a half, and my acne scars have almost blended with my natural skin color. My pimples and blackheads (gross I know) are almost invisible! I absolutely love this product my sister is now using it and loves it too!</li>
    <li> Great product. Thank you! : )</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has been using this daily for a few weeks, I think her skin is getting clearer and more even. It&#x27;s very refreshing to use. I like it.</li>
    <li> Nothing remarkable. Didn&#x27;t reduce dark spots.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because all of the great reviews but this toner didn&#x27;t help one bit, my acne is noticeably worse I decided to use it for 2 weeks to see if it got better but it didnt, it also recently made my face start to peel because of how dry it was, I would definitely not recommended this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This made my skin brea out horribly and did nothing to fade previous acne marks or diminish current breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have tried many fade and ant-acne products and so, I am quite discouraged when I try something new.  I will say that this works.  I use it mostly on my shoulders and arms and I have noticed a change over time.  I use it on my face when I remember.  It doesn&#x27;t happen over night but its been about 6-8 months (3-4 bottles later) and there is a fade of my acne scars and less acne on my shoulders.  I also do not use it twice a day.  I use it at night after I shower.  Its possible that if you used it twice a day, you may see quicker results.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this product works wonders on my face. I have combination skin and moderate post-acne marks from time to time. I use this product every other day or two. When I slack off in it&#x27;s use I have to use it every day for a consecutive three days before the rewards begin showing on my skin again. This product makes my skin smooth and have an almost matte look. My face looks like I&#x27;m wearing foundation now, when I am not. Whenevr I am consistent in use of this product I can go without make-up because my face really glows beautifully.     I have no complaints and I&#x27;m actually here online again to purchase a few  more bottles of the product to use. It is simply an amazing product for my skin.</li>
    <li> When i first started using the product, my face alway dried up quickly (and even burned because my face was too dry)and i had to apply more facial lotion than usual. In about two weeks, my face got use to this product and i am slowly beginning to see improvements. i would recommend putting hand lotion after too because it does dries the skin on your hand when in contact.</li>
    <li> This has to be made with essence of unicorn and dragon tears because it&#x27;s magical! I waited until I&#x27;d used it 5 times but honestly, after the first time my skin was already so clear and bright. It immediately started fighting the summer rash my skin suffers every year and has left my complexion the best it&#x27;s been in a while. The scent is not for everyone but personally, I really like it so I don&#x27;t mind how strong it is. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> though this product did not work completely it really helped loved it but only lasted a week or 2</li>
    <li> This cleans your face extremely well. After using this you wont have a speck of dirt left on your face. It can work great and be used as a makeup remover and brush cleaner on top of just as a toner. It doesn&#x27;t do anything about acne scars though. But it does dry out active acne. It&#x27;s a bit harsh and drying so you have to really moisturize A LOT after using it.</li>
    <li> Great toner. Keeps pores clean and fights off acne. Neutrogena&#x27;s facial cleansing products have been very effective in comparison to more expensive brands like Proactiv. It works better and is more affordable, plus it doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical odor, which Proactiv does. It&#x27;s important to use toner after cleansing, and I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel extra clean and it does help in fading dark spots.  Good price, a keeper.</li>
    <li> Great product to try! This is worth the extra price because it seems to treat and prevent acne better than any other toner I have tried.</li>
    <li> Nice big bottle of toner.  I have the oily skin type so I really like that it is 2% salicylic acid because this helps to control the oil a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps keep down razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fresh light scent, not purfumed</li>
    <li> This made my face extremely dry anywhere I applied it.  It also made my face break out.  I had high hopes but was extremely disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed! I was looking for a product with a great reputation that wouldn&#x27;t hurt the bank. This has been working great for me! I needed something that would fade away previous blemish marks as well as control future blemishes! Great product!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rapid Clear is perfect for my very sensitive skin. I use the original Neutrogena face wash to go with this product. If your looking for a toner that&#x27;s easy on the skin this is it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for about 5 months. I originally bought it because I was interested in the idea of it fading post acne marks. My skin tone was so unbalanced so I was desperate to try something that was affordable and would help.  The first time I used it, my face felt like it was burning a little bit. It never caused me to breakout and after using it regularly, my face became adjusted to it. Now it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore, but at first it did. If this happens, I suggest sticking with it until your skin gets accustomed to it. WIth that said, there is a noticeable different in my face&#x27;s skin tone. My complexion has gotten so much better. It does take time to really work and the progress is slow, but it does work. I&#x27;ll continue to use it! It has helped with my acne (though I&#x27;ve combined it with a benzoyl peroxide lotion) and I hardly get ANY breakouts anymore on my face.   Also, moisturize with SPF. You&#x27;re skin will be more susceptible to getting burnt by the sun using this product. Plus, moisturizing with SPF is great for your skin and anti-aging!  Will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> I definitely see a difference in the appearance of acne scars. Besides that it leaves u with quite a fresh feeling, but I still like to rinse my skin with plain cold water after I&#x27;ve wiped it down with this toner at night. The next morning u wake up with really soft skin, especially if you apply a thin layer of moisturizer after toning.</li>
    <li> This has become one of my holy grail products. I have light to moderate adult acne with fairly sensitive (but not oily) skin. I use this once a day followed buy a heavy Cetaphil moisturizer and the results are amazing. After several months of use as part of my daily regimen, I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-smaller pores (similar results to other Neutrogena toners I had used in the past)&lt;br /&gt;-lightened red spots/acne scarring&lt;br /&gt;-better skin tone (it seemed to even out a few pock-mark type scars)&lt;br /&gt;-smaller and less frequent breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably can&#x27;t completely credit this one product, but it seems that my cystic as well as surface breakouts have been GREATLY reduced and when they do occur, they are far less visible and the scars fade much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You MUST keep an eye on the drying, though. Moisturize with a non-comedogenic whenever you use it and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> only toner which dries my skin. I have a very oily skin. Recommended only for very oily skin.</li>
    <li> My skin definitely cleared up after using! I was having stubborn break outs along my chin line and forehead that was driving me insane. Once I started using 2x day (morning and at night), I started seeing difference. It also didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but I always made sure my skin was well moisturized to prevent that potential side effect.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few toners out there with both Salicylic Acid AND Glycolic Acid. In my opinion, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I am a 41-year-old woman with combination skin.  In the last few years I&#x27;ve started having more and more breakouts and within the last few months it was at the worst point ever (even worse than in my teens)!  I had seen a dermatologist and was using both prescription gel and lotion but decided to try this toner in combination with a more gentle cleanser.  This toner works great for me.  It started working right away and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts since I started using it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for only a few weeks and my skin looks and feels wonderful.  It&#x27;s even making my old pimple marks fade.  I do normally have some dry skin spots on my face but they aren&#x27;t any more dry than usual (in fact, my overall skin tone is a lot more even).  I&#x27;m now not using anything on my face except a gentle Neutrogena cleanser, a very small amount of moisturizer, and I use this toner 3 times a day.</li>
    <li> When I cleanse my face and apply my makeup, my makeup slides off my face literally. This toner makes my face so oily I had to stop using it after only a week.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 bottles and when I received them, they were not sealed. Hoping for the best, I still used it. Not even an hour later, I developed a severe allergic reaction. I have used Neutrogena acne products in the past and never had any problems.But I always made sure that they were sealed before I buy them. So I ended up going to the doctor and spent more money on medications. The bad part is that I can&#x27;t return them. Lesson learned, never order liquid products.</li>
    <li> Its salicylic acid so it can definitely dry out skin. You might also see some purging at first because this cleans out your pores, didn&#x27;t see a dramatic change in the fading of my post pimple marks. Would still recommend though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toner for over a month and have been quite impressed. I have mild to moderate acne, but my major concern is scarring. This faded my scars (they&#x27;re still there but they look much better) and keeps my acne at bay in the mean time. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that it makes my skin very red, but I just don&#x27;t use it in the morning.</li>
    <li> The item arrived earlier than expected. But with all honesty it didn&#x27;t work for me. Though it will helps you minimize the appearance of pores I think, but when it comes to pimples and acne scars I think it&#x27;s not for me and didn&#x27;t do its job. But of course every individual is different it may work to someone else.</li>
    <li> Basically I&#x27;ve been using this toner in order to remove some moderately painful bumps and swelling and in addition some old hyperpigmentation marks. I&#x27;ve seen some progress towards clear skin, finished the bottle. Gonna buy another one to see if it can fight off the last of them, I&#x27;m close to clear skin. Will be happier when it&#x27;s all gone. Thanks</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. It was really hard for my skin even thought I used it just twice. I wouldn&#x27;t recommended</li>
    <li> I am quite often please with Neutrogena products!! And this one is really good too. It does work for my skin!!!</li>
    <li> Best toner to use if your face is broken out from that time of the month or just in general. It is strong so I only use it once a day in the morning before I apply my makeup. I have been sensitive, very fair, combination skin (usually very oily) and this toner keeps my skin clear, matte and free of past acne marks. It does take about two weeks to fade past dark spots. I highly recommend this toner.</li>
    <li> This toner appears to me, after a while of using, to be an average toner.  I don&#x27;t see amazing results from using it, but it does an okay job of cleaning the face.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! This is the first ever online review I am writing because I just had to share how awesome this toner is. I&#x27;ve only used it twice and am in love with it. I&#x27;m 20 and have had little acne bumps on my forehead for as long as I can remember, and I never thought they would go away. But after using this toner just twice, all the bumps/redness have faded! Obviously I have to use it more to see the long term effects, but for short term, I am very satisfied. It&#x27;s not too rough on my skin either...as long as you moisturize after using the product, it doesn&#x27;t completely dry out. And it leaves a very pleasant smell after. I highly recommend this product, you can hardly ever go wrong with Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 and half weeks now. I have seen this product help to clear my pores. At first it help to bring out my pimples. Towards the end of the 2nd week, I have seen some improvement. I will continue to use this with hopes of continued progress. My skin looks clearer with the exception of the marks.  I can&#x27;t speak to it fading marks b/c I think its too soon to see a difference. It hasn&#x27;t been drying on my skin as others have experienced.</li>
    <li> I will be the first to say I do not normally write any reviews but after using this product I had to write a review. I am a 30 yrs old African American Male who has a break out of Atopic dermatitis ( eczema) on the left side of my face, my dermatologist gave me Clindamycin liquid to get rid of the  blisters and the scaling but it left dark spots on my face. I started using this product and within 3 weeks it was completely gone.  I would highly recommend this product and use it as directed to see the results. It will dry out your skin but that is an easy fix</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product to help heal my face and finally get rid of my bumps. I suffered two bouts of facial shingles (Not fun) last year and am still trying to fade the marks and fight the unexpected acne that developed with it. I tried the three step systems, creams, masks, scrubs, tea tree oil, etc. Nothing helped and I kept developing painful bumps, some formed into pimples, some just became painful bumps just under the skin. I saw this toner for a few bucks and thought \\&quot;Why not, this can be the last thing I try before calling the dermatologist.\\&quot; It worked! It actually worked! I use a gentle cleanser and this toner twice a day. The marks on my cheeks started fading after two days! My forehead (Where the shingles breakouts occurred) looks so much better. I am shocked that I finally found something that works and works so well. My only complaint is that it makes my skin feel dry, so I just use a good moisturizer. I also found that this toner is refining my pores. So happy with this toner! I actually went out without makeup today.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good general, everyday toner. I like that my face feels clean without getting tight or dry. There is no residue after it dries. My face just feels clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that blackheads and pores are minimized, so that is a nice benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice any fading action at all though after daily use and finishing a whole bottle. Newer marks did not go away any more quickly and older ones did not fade at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it for a basic toner, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the \\&quot;fade\\&quot; action.</li>
    <li> I always run out of the Proactiv toner before the other two parts of the kit (I use the extra strength formula).  I searched for something with the same strength of salicylic acid (2%), and this fit the bill.  It seems to be a bit more drying than the Proactiv formula and I don&#x27;t care for the added dye (what&#x27;s the point???), but the overall effect seems to the same.  I&#x27;ll use it as a fill in when I run low on my other toner.</li>
    <li> i love this product very much and it works great, my spots were fading within a week of usage i paired it with the 3 piece acne kit and my face never looked better, so impressed need to get me more of this unlimited supply</li>
    <li> not sure if it actually fades the appearance of scars, however, does a good job preventing breakouts without overdrying my skin.</li>
    <li> Really keeps my acne under good control. Easy to use. I just fold a kleenex up to a small square, squirt a generous amount onto it and apply it over my whole face. Nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> Cant live without this! It works &amp; doesnt dry out my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does a great job in relatively fast amount of time when consistently used.</li>
    <li> If I could give it 10 stars I would!  I&#x27;ve used so many OTC acne products but hands down this is the best. Recommended this to several friends too. Cleared up my acne quick and helps fade dark stops left behind. I&#x27;m in my 30s and developed horrible acne after having my kids. Now my face is clear and flawless!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this product because my skin is so sensitive and very acne-prone, but I decided to buy this because of the great reviews, and I was looking for a fast way to treat my acne flare-up. Over the past month, I&#x27;ve developed big, red, huge zits on my cheek and chin area, which made me very self-conscious.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product because I started seeing results the second day, but it wasn&#x27;t until the third day that I really saw significant results. I use it morning and night after cleansing, and my acne is on its way to being pretty much gone. It&#x27;s helped with fading the scars already (although I know it will take a while to see full results), and I have noticed my skin is less oily since using this (however, that could also be due to the konjac sponge I&#x27;m using). I&#x27;m also pleased that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry. I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try!</li>
    <li> I will recommend this product to my friends. It gives energy to my skin, my face seems healthy and feels fresh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months as a necessity to my face cleansing regime. It minimizes my pores, cleans, and prevents most breakouts.</li>
    <li> Since I had my baby, my pregnancy acne wouldn&#x27;t go away. I found this product at Walmart because some acne had left gross red marks. I&#x27;m on day 5 of use and my acne is gone and my scars are more of a light pink now, almost gone. The first day this did bring all my acne to the top of my skin though, but it was just pulling the bacteria out. So push through the first day! It is so worth it!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face for zits and chest and back keratosis pilaris.i put it in a spray bottle and spray it on after a shower. My husband uses it too and it works. Best thing i have found yet...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I can now count on my subscription to guarantee I have this product every three months.  It&#x27;s so hard to find at my local retail stores now they sell out fast plus it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
    <li> I can never find this in stores, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s on amazon. Really great product. takes some getting used to, because alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;but afterwards, its cooling, and very effective for fading post acne blemishes and brown spots.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Keeps the breakouts down and really helps fade age spots.</li>
    <li> I am 42, and had some adult-onset acne in my mid-30s, much worse than as a teenager. I tried tons of products, and finally settled on a combo of Proactiv and Dr. Perricone products that kept the breakouts under control -- most of the time. I recently ran out of the benzoyl peroxide lotion and pore-clearing toner all at the same time. I also decided around that time to try a mild, over-the-counter face peel to fight off wrinkles. Well, I misread the directions on it, and didn&#x27;t get it washed off properly. As a consequence of my neglect, my forehead, nose and chin all broke out at once. I needed something fast so ran to the drugstore and bought the Rapid Clear toner. Two weeks later, my face is completely clear! The pimples on my forehead and chin were gone in a couple of days. Then, I finally realized that the bumps around my nose weren&#x27;t pimples, they were actually clusters of small blisters from the acid peel. I figured I should be using something else on blisters than a toner, but, the blisters actually had started to dry up! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I had a huge blister on my cheek which I thought it was a gigantic cystic acne lump, but it was a blister. The Rapid Clear healed it in less than a week! It was a little dry around that area, but I just used a small amount of my usual Aveeno Ultra Calming facial moisturizer to compensate. I&#x27;ve also had a couple of under-the-surface bumps under my chin that have been there a couple of years. They are shrinking, too! I&#x27;m not sure about the fading claims, but for me, this worked better than I ever could have imagined on the acne and the blisters. I use it twice a day now and am loving it!</li>
    <li> This product contains both Beta and Alpha hydroxy acid so it has both acne fighters. The scent is a little bit too much but it dissipates quickly. I love this stuff and use it every day.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very gentle.</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t work so perfectly for me! It doesn&#x27;t reduce my acne scar apparently ,just a little bit functional and it make my skin dry and peeling</li>
    <li> These strong astringents are great as aftershave as they tend to contain alcohol and thusly help prevent your skin from getting infected. I notice far fewer ingrown hairs and infected follicles when I use this stuff after shaving as opposed to a gentler toner. Be sure to follow with a good morsturizer as it will dry your skin out otherwise. As far as magically clearing up all your acne I have had better results with this stuff as opposed to clean &amp; clear but still believe that not overbathing and having good moisturizing practices will help you more in that department.</li>
    <li> Any Neutrogena product is always five stars with me.</li>
    <li> I got a lot of breakouts everyday. When I applied it to all my face, I felt IRRITANT, which made me think it&#x27;s working fast. About 10 seconds later, the feeling was gone. I think it should be tested before using.</li>
</ol>
