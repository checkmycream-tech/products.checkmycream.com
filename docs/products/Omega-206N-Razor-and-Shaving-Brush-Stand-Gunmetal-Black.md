      <li>Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice stand.</li>
      <li>This is a nice looking stand.  </li>

      <li>Looks nice in our bathroom.</li>
      <li>This is a nice looking stand.</li>
      <li>Sure it holds the stuff and fits nicely on my bathroom sink but the paint chiped off almost out of the box.</li>
      <li>The stand was reasonably priced, arrived on time, in tact and was the perfect fit for the space I have in the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I should have read the description better before ordering....</li>
      <li>It just looked better and had a sturdier design (better balanced) than the others.  </li>
      <li>This makes more sense then hanging it by the top of the handle.</li>
      <li>I wanted something that was NOT chrome or silver, as most of these stands are.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s stylish and compact.</li>
      <li>So unless you have brushes in the very large side, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>My Merkur 34C double edge razor and Semogue 1305 shaving brush fit perfectly on it.  </li>
      <li>With that in mind it works just fine and looks pretty darn good</li>
      <li>With the handle exposed you have easy access to release and re-dock the brush.</li>
      <li>Some scant blackish residue inside the handle holding tube, rinsed out easily.</li>
      <li>but this is still fine.</li>
      <li>Works fine with my brush.</li>
      <li>This brush stand does a fine job of holding the badger hair brush from my art of shaving kit.  </li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with it and am sure it will last for many years to come.  </li>
      <li>My Merkur 23C and no name brush fit just fine though.</li>
      <li>All of my razors fit, including my bulldog handle.</li>
      <li>Some reviewers have said it doesn&#x27;t fit their brush and or razor</li>
      <li>It holds all but one of my brushes, a Kent BK12 (monster) she&#x27;ll fit but not well.</li>
      <li>At first it appears to be the perfect razor stand until you look in the barrel and find it full of rough guck.</li>
      <li>Nice except it doesn&#x27;t fit the Omega Professional 48 Boar brush.</li>
      <li>Luckily my Ambroley, Merkur 34c and EJ DE89 all fit in it.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this stand because I thought it would look cool with my razorock stealth razor.  </li>
      <li>In fact, the real item looks much better than the picture does.  </li>
      <li>Great little stand, compact and well made.</li>
      <li>It is also rather short, and not even sure it will fit a mach 3 razor.</li>
      <li>The matte paint came right off to reveal the brass underneath.</li>
      <li>The chrome would have better matched the chrome of my double edge razor, but the gunmetal black still looks good</li>
      <li>Be aware, however, the the tube that holds the razor won&#x27;t work with fat- or curved-handled razors.</li>
      <li>Works exactly as I had hoped it would.  </li>
      <li>This is small and compact, and looks good.</li>
      <li>Nice textured black finish.</li>
      <li>I had to bend the stand to fit the larger brush.</li>
      <li>I really like this stand.</li>
      <li>so it doesn’t take much room on my bathroom counter.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really did not think of a stand as a requirement.  </li>
      <li>Has more of a matte black look than compared to the pic.  </li>
      <li>i think the brush holder part could be a little better</li>
      <li>On the one I received right out of the box the finish is chipped off in several places.  </li>
      <li>It also look nice on the counter but only if you have a small loft brush.</li>
      <li>Other than that it looks cool and servs its purpose.</li>
      <li>old (OLD, OLD) brush doesn&#x27;t quite fit the holder, but it was an odd shaped promo item, so...</li>
      <li>Holds the brush in the ready position with handle above the slot.</li>
      <li>The store wanted twice as much for a similar stand</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s solidly made and very stable.  </li>
      <li>Well, after one look, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that the handle sits above the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; and the brush hangs below it.</li>
      <li>so I thought I&#x27;d brush whatever it was with a regular old toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I’ve got no regrets.  </li>
      <li>The stand is VERY small and the razor won&#x27;t fit.</li>

<li> and it does match the dark handle of my shaving</li>

<li> This thing means i have to pack less into my shave kit during travel or have less clutter on the counter at home.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a nice looking stand.  Appears to be a quality build.  Would work well with an average sized brush.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s too small for larger knot brushes (such as my Omega 10049).  I had to bend the stand to fit the larger brush.</li>
    <li> Stable, heavy enough to not tip over. Won&#x27;t win any design awards. Does the job. Using it to hold a Standard Razors razor. Some scant blackish residue inside the handle holding tube, rinsed out easily.</li>
    <li> I looked at numerous razor &amp; shave brush stands before deciding to buy the Omega 206N.  It just looked better and had a sturdier design (better balanced) than the others.  I was torn between the gunmetal black and the chrome, but decided to buy the gunmetal black.  I’ve got no regrets.  The chrome would have better matched the chrome of my double edge razor, but the gunmetal black still looks good and it does match the dark handle of my shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Omega 206N does have a small footprint so it doesn’t take much room on my bathroom counter.  My Merkur 34C double edge razor and Semogue 1305 shaving brush fit perfectly on it.  The quality of the metal and construction appears to be top-notched.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this stand because I thought it would look cool with my razorock stealth razor.  The stand is VERY small and the razor won&#x27;t fit. Other than that it looks cool and servs its purpose.</li>
    <li> No damage upon arrival like some reported. Works fine with my brush. I remember reading a review stating that there was not enough room for the brush to hang from the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; mount. Well, after one look, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that the handle sits above the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; and the brush hangs below it. With that in mind it works just fine and looks pretty darn good sitting there next to the soap dish.</li>
    <li> At first it appears to be the perfect razor stand until you look in the barrel and find it full of rough guck. I didn&#x27;t want to scuff up my razor so I thought I&#x27;d brush whatever it was with a regular old toothbrush. The matte paint came right off to reveal the brass underneath. If the finish can&#x27;t handle a soft-bristle toothbrush it will never hold up to average wear and tear. I wish I had paid closer attention to the comments about paint chipping.</li>
    <li> I wanted something that was NOT chrome or silver, as most of these stands are.  This is small and compact, and looks good.</li>
    <li> This razor and brush holder is very nice.  In fact, the real item looks much better than the picture does.  It&#x27;s solidly made and very stable.  It won&#x27;t tip over regardless of the weight of the razor or brush.  Be aware, however, the the tube that holds the razor won&#x27;t work with fat- or curved-handled razors.</li>
    <li> Having recently gotten into shaving with a safety razor, I went out and bought a razor and a brush, but I needed a stand.  The store wanted twice as much for a similar stand so I ordered it on Amazon.  Just got it today and it looks great on the sink and holds the brush and razor nicely.  Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Displays my safety razor and brush very nicely</li>
    <li> Sure it holds the stuff and fits nicely on my bathroom sink but the paint chiped off almost out of the box.</li>
    <li> Looks nice in our bathroom. The store wanted to sell us a nice one for about $50.</li>
    <li> I received a gold stand, not a gunmetal black stand. Not worth the effort of trying to exchange. It is also rather short, and not even sure it will fit a mach 3 razor.</li>
    <li> Good stand. The razor holder is a little skinny for some Double Edge razors. But all around good quality.</li>
    <li> This thing means i have to pack less into my shave kit during travel or have less clutter on the counter at home. Luckily my Ambroley, Merkur 34c and EJ DE89 all fit in it. Nice textured black finish.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;My old (OLD, OLD) brush doesn&#x27;t quite fit the holder, but it was an odd shaped promo item, so...</li>
    <li> Great little stand, compact and well made.</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible quality stand, it looks and feels cheap but at $25 it wasn&#x27;t.  On the one I received right out of the box the finish is chipped off in several places.  It&#x27;s also poorly designed and terribly small, it doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to fitting my Tweezerman shaving brush or Harry&#x27;s Truman razor.  It&#x27;s already packaged up to be returned.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as I had hoped it would.  I wish it had been five bucks cheaper however.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Well made and solid, but did not fit my Murkur 43C razor so I had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the description better before ordering....my fault.</li>
    <li> Nice stand. I did think it would be bigger, but it&#x27;s not an issue. It holds all but one of my brushes, a Kent BK12 (monster) she&#x27;ll fit but not well. So unless you have brushes in the very large side, you&#x27;re good to go. All of my razors fit, including my bulldog handle.</li>
    <li> This brush stand does a fine job of holding the badger hair brush from my art of shaving kit.  It has just enough height without being too tall as to get in the way or get knocked over.</li>
    <li> just what i wanted. got it as a gift and he loves it. i think the brush holder part could be a little better but this is still fine.</li>
    <li> Small foot print and very stable. Holds the brush in the ready position with handle above the slot. This makes more sense then hanging it by the top of the handle. With the handle exposed you have easy access to release and re-dock the brush. Its the same for the razor holder. Very nice design.</li>
    <li> When I started back shaving with a brush and double edge razor I really did not think of a stand as a requirement.  After learning that a brush needs to be inverted in order to dry correctly I looked for a stand.  I found the Omega 206N after a short search and decided to give it a try.  The stand was reasonably priced, arrived on time, in tact and was the perfect fit for the space I have in the bathroom.  I am very satisfied with it and am sure it will last for many years to come.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Has more of a matte black look than compared to the pic.  Fits my Lord razor and omega brush.  Also it came as a set of 3 (3 seperate identical stands), not sure if I miss read the offer or they made a mistake.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Nice except it doesn&#x27;t fit the Omega Professional 48 Boar brush.</li>
    <li> Use for shaving brush and Gillette Fat Boy razor. Allows both to air dry between shaves. Compact. A bit pricey, but quality made.</li>
    <li> I could only give this 4 stars because it is just a bit short when I put my brush in it.  It is functional but I don&#x27;t like the fact that the brush sits on the bottom of the stand with no air between it.  It also is not designed for all razor handles.  If you have a thick handle this stand will not work for you.  I bought this to use as a travel stand and would recommend it for that purpose as it has a small footprint and will not take up too much space in your bag.  It also look nice on the counter but only if you have a small loft brush.</li>
    <li> This razor and shaving brush stand is very sturdy and holds my shaving brush and razor perfectly. I am very glad that I purchased this stand!</li>
    <li> I really like this stand. It&#x27;s stylish and compact. It suits my needs perfectly. Some reviewers have said it doesn&#x27;t fit their brush and or razor so take that into consideration. My Merkur 23C and no name brush fit just fine though.</li>
    <li> This is a nice looking stand. The size is roughly 3 inches tall by 2 inches wide. It&#x27;s small but works. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the brush holder is not tall enough to hold a brush with the brushes down. It will hold it with the brushes up but that defeats the purpose.</li>
