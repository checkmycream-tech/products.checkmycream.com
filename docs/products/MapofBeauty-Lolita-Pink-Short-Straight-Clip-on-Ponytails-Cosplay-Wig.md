      <li>Perfect fit after adjusting size straps.</li>
      <li>This wig was gorgeous.</li>
      <li>but the size is good for a child.</li>
      <li>cap(a good one).</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;ll probably be fine!!</li>
      <li>All in all, this wig was great. :)</li>
      <li>Got this wig for a Madoka Magica cosplay and its pretty much perfect.</li>
      <li>ITS SO CUTE!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this wig!</li>
      <li>The two pigtails are removable and attach with clibs, and the wig is really nice quality.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The quality is also good and we love the detachable pig tails.</li>
      <li>When it arrived and after combing out the tangles I tried it on right away to ensured it fit perfectly, and it did!</li>
      <li>sooo cute i recamend you to buy a wig holder first!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good quality, and a nice color, like the picture.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m just completely satisfied with this wig</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m honestly really satisfied with how this wig looked.</li>
      <li>It did fit my 7 yr old perfectly.</li>
      <li>It matches exactly like the picture, color and texture wise.</li>
      <li>For the price, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>An OK quality, good for the price, I wear it quite frequently and get many compliments.</li>
      <li>This wig can easily be used, and is what I&#x27;m using it for, for a Madoka Kaname cosplay.</li>
      <li>It was easy to take out the tangles with my wide-tooth comb and it looked completely fine afterwards.</li>
      <li>The color of the clips are a light nude skin color, which matches the wig cap netting of the wig.</li>
      <li>It is in 3 pieces.. and the main wig piece looks awesome even without the ponies that can be adjusted for several looks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just excited for the girls play let&#x27;s do this.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to see it.</li>
      <li>Looks true to color.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>I do not normally have sizing problems with wigs, and normally end up tightening a wig to fit.</li>
      <li>Was great and like picture but didn&#x27;t fit my head or three of my friends :(</li>
      <li>Wig is good quality and not too small, though my short hair may help.</li>
      <li>Came with a wig cap which helps a lot when you have to pile long hair on top of your head to wear a short wig.</li>
      <li>but overall it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
      <li>The wig itself is very soft to the touch and isn&#x27;t overly shiny like other cheap synthetic wigs.</li>
      <li>The bangs needed a cut, which was expected, since it&#x27;s standard for most wigs to come like that.</li>
      <li>it was a bit smaller than anticipated,and not quite as thick as it looks in the picture, but with a little bit of work will be perfect for what i need it for.</li>
      <li>With this wig, not only did it feel like a child size, but it was much shorter than what the photos and description had promised.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There was a bit of confusion with the seller as to whether the wig was for an adult or child.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately the estimated shipping time was completely off.</li>
      <li>It came today EARLY</li>
      <li>I have ordered many wigs in the past from other sellers, and this is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had to return.</li>
      <li>In fact it was pretty loose</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad way at all because I have a bit of a bigger head than other people but the clips don&#x27;t have enough hair to cover the actual clip, which can be very aggravating</li>
      <li>Exactly what my daughter expected!</li>
      <li>Definitely not for an adult.</li>
      <li>The pigtails and the short hair are very soft and you can&#x27;t see the cap on the short hair.</li>
      <li>first, I was really skeptical because many reviewers complained about how small the wig was and how it was more of a child&#x27;s size than an adult&#x27;s.</li>

<li> Thin in some spots when styled certain ways.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard to hide the clips, but that can easily be fixed with some pink paint that matches the wig.</li>
<li> only fault with this entire wig is how thin it is at the back.</li>

<li> The clips on the pigtails are slightly visible, but you can style it so they&#x27;re not.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little on the thinner size</li>
<li> This is just a heads up for those who will complain about how thin it is in the back when purchasing this wig.</li>
<li> The only fixing that I have to do on this wig is cutting it, since some parts are oddly really long and to style it for my cosplay, straighten the wig, and recurl the ponytail</li>
<li> It was really messed up in the packaging, but it wasn&#x27;t anything bad.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my head&#x27;s small or what</li>
<li> Now don&#x27;t get scared and run off, it&#x27;s not SUPER THIN.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just that the wig is not as thick as it seems like in the picture.</li>
<li> The week is small and thin.</li>
<li> I ended up getting the wig 1 month later than the estimated date of arrival :(</li>
<li> I took to pig tails and put them on my blue wig base instead.</li>
<li> The wig base is to small for my head :(</li>
<li> Looks stupid on my head.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m honestly really satisfied with how this wig looked. It matches exactly like the picture, color and texture wise. The wig itself is very soft to the touch and isn&#x27;t overly shiny like other cheap synthetic wigs. When it arrived (it took about a month) I was really excited to see it. It was really messed up in the packaging, but it wasn&#x27;t anything bad. It was easy to take out the tangles with my wide-tooth comb and it looked completely fine afterwards. The only fixing that I have to do on this wig is cutting it, since some parts are oddly really long and to style it for my cosplay, straighten the wig, and recurl the ponytail parts.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was really skeptical because many reviewers complained about how small the wig was and how it was more of a child&#x27;s size than an adult&#x27;s. When it arrived and after combing out the tangles I tried it on right away to ensured it fit perfectly, and it did! In fact it was pretty loose so I had to tighten it up with the straps! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my head&#x27;s small or what but I&#x27;m just completely satisfied with this wig and I would definitely recommend buying this!!&lt;br /&gt;The only fault with this entire wig is how thin it is at the back. Now don&#x27;t get scared and run off, it&#x27;s not SUPER THIN. It still covers up the wig cap netting. It&#x27;s just that the wig is not as thick as it seems like in the picture. This is just a heads up for those who will complain about how thin it is in the back when purchasing this wig. And the clips of the ponytails show up and it&#x27;s hard to hide the clips, but that can easily be fixed with some pink paint that matches the wig. The color of the clips are a light nude skin color, which matches the wig cap netting of the wig.</li>
    <li> Awesome and adorable wig!</li>
    <li> Got this wig for a Madoka Magica cosplay and its pretty much perfect. it was a bit smaller than anticipated,and not quite as thick as it looks in the picture, but with a little bit of work will be perfect for what i need it for. For the price, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> This quality for a wig under $20 is undeniable. It is in 3 pieces.. and the main wig piece looks awesome even without the ponies that can be adjusted for several looks. Came with a wig cap which helps a lot when you have to pile long hair on top of your head to wear a short wig.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good quality, and a nice color, like the picture. The bangs needed a cut, which was expected, since it&#x27;s standard for most wigs to come like that. I used it for a Madoka Kaname cosplay, but I&#x27;ll probably use it for other ones since the ponytails are removable. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig!</li>
    <li> Comes in 3 pieces. The pigtails are attached to hair clips. I still can&#x27;t figure it out.</li>
    <li> I have ordered many wigs in the past from other sellers, and this is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had to return. I do not normally have sizing problems with wigs, and normally end up tightening a wig to fit. With this wig, not only did it feel like a child size, but it was much shorter than what the photos and description had promised. I was very disappointed because I was excited to wear it for a new cosplay I was making, but I ended up searching for a new pink wig the day this one arrived to replace the dud I received from this listing.</li>
    <li> The week is small and thin. The color is beautiful and I&#x27;m hoping I can make it work. It&#x27;s not a bad way at all because I have a bit of a bigger head than other people but the clips don&#x27;t have enough hair to cover the actual clip, which can be very aggravating but Monaco wears those big bows so it&#x27;ll probably be fine!!! I&#x27;m just excited for the girls play let&#x27;s do this.</li>
    <li> Looks stupid on my head.</li>
    <li> The product is great, it looks a lot like the picture. The two pigtails are removable and attach with clibs, and the wig is really nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;There was a bit of confusion with the seller as to whether the wig was for an adult or child. I feel like this could have saved time if they had an option on the page for what size I want.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the estimated shipping time was completely off. I ended up getting the wig 1 month later than the estimated date of arrival :(</li>
    <li> very happy...no problems...thank you...</li>
    <li> Fits my head perfectly!  Wig is good quality and not too small, though my short hair may help.</li>
    <li> Looks true to color. Perfect fit after adjusting size straps. Thin in some spots when styled certain ways. Came with a temporary tattoo of dolphins and a wig cap(a good one). Its so Kawaii &#x27;</li>
    <li> This wig is perfect for my daughter. I was concerned it would be too big for her small head but the size is good for a child. The quality is also good and we love the detachable pig tails. It&#x27;s two wigs in one.</li>
    <li> An OK quality, good for the price, I wear it quite frequently and get many compliments. It&#x27;s a little on the thinner size but overall it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
    <li> Definitely not for an adult. It did fit my 7 yr old perfectly.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my daughter expected!</li>
    <li> This wig was gorgeous. The only problem is that it&#x27;s a little small for my head and I have a pretty small head. The pigtails and the short hair are very soft and you can&#x27;t see the cap on the short hair. The clips on the pigtails are slightly visible, but you can style it so they&#x27;re not. This wig can easily be used, and is what I&#x27;m using it for, for a Madoka Kaname cosplay. All in all, this wig was great. :)</li>
    <li> It came today EARLY and i couldn&#x27;t be happier, ITS SO CUTE!</li>
    <li> sooo cute i recamend you to buy a wig holder first!!!!</li>
    <li> The wig base is to small for my head :( I took to pig tails and put them on my blue wig base instead. Was great and like picture but didn&#x27;t fit my head or three of my friends :(</li>
