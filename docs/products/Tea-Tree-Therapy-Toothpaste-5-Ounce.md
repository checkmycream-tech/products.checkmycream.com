### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Best toothpaste ever.</li>
      <li>Promt delivery, great product!</li>
      <li>Tea tree is the best for all around health.</li>
      <li>Smells great.</li>
      <li>Helps prevent kanker sores which is great.</li>
      <li>got it from AmericaRX, great price.</li>
      <li>so I thought the combination was a good one.</li>
      <li>I switched to this toothbrush after my mother tried it for her ultra-sensitive gums and loved it.</li>
      <li>(the plant is native to Australia) being used to treat gum disease effectively</li>
      <li>It is a good cleaner and taste is fine.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>also like to add salt for better taste</li>
      <li>of my favorite toothpaste</li>
      <li>great toothpaste whole family loves it.</li>
      <li>My dentist noticed, and I believe that&#x27;s the best review possible.</li>
      <li>My gums seem to feel healthy.</li>
      <li>kind of salty and really clean.</li>
      <li>The taste isn&#x27;t as strong as using baking soda alone and in combination with the tea tree oil leaves my mouth feeling fresh without the strong mint flavor of so many toothpastes.</li>
      <li>Cleans very well and has a nice flavor.</li>
      <li>Arm &amp; Hammer, if you&#x27;d go back to that original, it would be great.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste so much!</li>
      <li>It seems to clean our teeth well.  </li>
      <li>In a search for that taste again, I tried this, which is not a bad working toothpaste, but the herbs or whatever have a slightly sweet taste that is not what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>Amazing fresh natural feeling after brush.</li>
      <li>within those 14 days I started to notice that I felt like I had been to the dentist each and every time I used it; my mouth hasn&#x27;t felt so fresh and clean in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>to have an incredibly fresh and clean mouth each and every day?  </li>
      <li>Not cheap, but contains no harmful chemicals, natural ingredients, and tastes good!</li>
      <li>this is the first toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever had that&#x27;s kept my mouth from getting a funky taste overnight.</li>
      <li>I use this toothpaste consistently.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a natural toothpaste with a mild flavor this is definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>I like this toothpaste, but I&#x27;m really hoping for more of a tea tree oil taste, as I remember from similar toothpaste from my childhood.  </li>
      <li>I have to say that after almost a month using this toothpaste I have seen a positive difference in my teeth.</li>
      <li>now continue to use this toothpaste every morning and every night without hesitation just because of how fresh and clean my mouth feels; I actually look forward to brushing in the morning and night just because of how it makes my mouth feel overall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unfortunately I never see it at stores where I live now, so I either order it online, or buy Tom&#x27;s tea tree toothpaste, which is similar (but still not my favorite).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on an absolute quest for the toothpaste of my dreams.</li>
      <li>I really miss the baking soda toothpaste that had no mint flavor...</li>
      <li>After using this toothpaste a few nights in a row, it&#x27;s obvious that it really does keep your mouth clean a lot better than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My dentist had heard of it and even wrote down the brand because so many people in his office swear by it.</li>
      <li>My teeth look better and bleed a lot less.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and will buy again</li>
      <li>Tea tree oil is supposed to be an efficient antiseptic that kills bacteria fast as well as being soothing to your gums for people with sensitive teeth, like me.</li>
      <li>I have used sensitive teeth formulations, from the mega toothpaste companies, that all warn you not to use the product long-term.  </li>
      <li>all natural is a comfort.</li>
      <li>But actually I&#x27;m using this new tea tree toothpaste.&#x27;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this toothpaste.Cleans very well and has a nice flavor.Knowing that&#x27;s its&#x27; all natural is a comfort.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste, but I&#x27;m really hoping for more of a tea tree oil taste, as I remember from similar toothpaste from my childhood.  I&#x27;ve been on an absolute quest for the toothpaste of my dreams.</li>
    <li> It is a good cleaner and taste is fine.  This is our 4th order.  It seems to clean our teeth well.  My gums seem to feel healthy.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever.</li>
    <li> Amazing fresh natural feeling after brush. Highly recommend and will buy again</li>
    <li> Tea tree is the best for all around health.</li>
    <li> After using this toothpaste a few nights in a row, it&#x27;s obvious that it really does keep your mouth clean a lot better than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; toothpaste. I never wake up with yucky morning mouth like I ALWAYS have before..this is the first toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever had that&#x27;s kept my mouth from getting a funky taste overnight. I&#x27;m definitely going to tj maxx to see if they have anymore and stocking up!</li>
    <li> I have to say that after almost a month using this toothpaste I have seen a positive difference in my teeth. I read an article about tea tree oil (the plant is native to Australia) being used to treat gum disease effectively so I decided to try it.  I&#x27;d used baking soda to brush my teeth before so I thought the combination was a good one. The taste isn&#x27;t as strong as using baking soda alone and in combination with the tea tree oil leaves my mouth feeling fresh without the strong mint flavor of so many toothpastes. It isn&#x27;t gritty either. Tea tree oil is supposed to be an efficient antiseptic that kills bacteria fast as well as being soothing to your gums for people with sensitive teeth, like me. I have used sensitive teeth formulations, from the mega toothpaste companies, that all warn you not to use the product long-term.  This product doesn&#x27;t have that chilling warning because the ingredients are different when you read the tubes. If you are looking for a natural toothpaste with a mild flavor this is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste so much! People are telling me my teeth are very white! Great product!</li>
    <li> I really miss the baking soda toothpaste that had no mint flavor...kind of salty and really clean. In a search for that taste again, I tried this, which is not a bad working toothpaste, but the herbs or whatever have a slightly sweet taste that is not what I was hoping for. Arm &amp; Hammer, if you&#x27;d go back to that original, it would be great. Other toothpastes...are you listening? Anyone? Anyone?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a long time. Not cheap, but contains no harmful chemicals, natural ingredients, and tastes good!</li>
    <li> *Flouride FREE&lt;br /&gt;*Great for preventing/healing canker sores&lt;br /&gt;*One of my favorite toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;*I also like to add salt for better taste&lt;br /&gt;*This toothpaste last much longer, as you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, just a small dime size&lt;br /&gt;*I got it from AmericaRX, great price.</li>
    <li> My dentist noticed, and I believe that&#x27;s the best review possible. I don&#x27;t brush or floss as often as I should. I know that&#x27;s bad. I switched to this toothbrush after my mother tried it for her ultra-sensitive gums and loved it. My dentist said, &#x27;oh, I see you&#x27;ve been brushing and flossing twice daily like I recommended!&#x27; I said, &amp;#34;well, no. I try! But actually I&#x27;m using this new tea tree toothpaste.&#x27; My dentist had heard of it and even wrote down the brand because so many people in his office swear by it. My teeth look better and bleed a lot less. The taste is slightly different from regular toothpaste, it is like a stickier, subtle mint than a frothy wintergreen blast, but it is not uncomfortable at all. I use this toothpaste consistently. Unfortunately I never see it at stores where I live now, so I either order it online, or buy Tom&#x27;s tea tree toothpaste, which is similar (but still not my favorite).</li>
    <li> Helps prevent kanker sores which is great. Smells great. I love it.</li>
    <li> Promt delivery, great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste when my naturopathic physician recommended using tea tree oil in my oral health program to help reverse my SEVERE gingivitis.  My gum disease was so severe I couldn&#x27;t brush without the sink being all bloody and severe pain.  I knew only something that was all natural without fluoride and the SLS and other artificial crap other toothpaste contains would do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this toothpaste every morning and every night for the next 14 days and within those 14 days I started to notice that I felt like I had been to the dentist each and every time I used it; my mouth hasn&#x27;t felt so fresh and clean in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now continue to use this toothpaste every morning and every night without hesitation just because of how fresh and clean my mouth feels; I actually look forward to brushing in the morning and night just because of how it makes my mouth feel overall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to have an incredibly fresh and clean mouth each and every day?  Use this toothpaste and then combine it with Tea Tree Therapy Tea Tree Alcohol-Free Mouthwash!  Believe me, you&#x27;ve never had a fresher feeling mouth!</li>
    <li> great toothpaste whole family loves it. it also helps with infected gums</li>
