      <li>but it feels great and helps tremendously.</li>
      <li>but the more you use it the more you want to use it all over!</li>
      <li>Primarily, I use this as a night cream, and in the morning I can notice a bright moisturized look to my skin.  </li>
      <li>In my honest opinion however, if you can afford it, I would suggest getting Egyptian Magic instead.</li>
      <li>but I love the texture.</li>
      <li>and it is already looking better.  </li>
      <li>I got a sample of Egyptian Magic and fell in love with it.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff, and put it on my lips and face too.</li>

      <li>Cream Smells and didn&#x27;t make my skin any better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I usually use organic coconut oil and organic bees wax on my sensitive skin. It works great but I feel that it was lacking in the hydration without making me super oily. I read about Sweet Bee Magic and decided to give it a try. My face looks so soft , clear, hydrated, and even toned. I only use a tiny amount as a little goes a long way. I also use it all over my body at night and feel soft but not greasy. It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as my coconut oil and bees wax I make but that&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ve also been putting it on some surgery scars I have to see if it will help them heal up better. This is some really good stuff that does really amazing things for your skin.</li>
    <li> I put this on my forehead and it reduces the fine lines drastically. Love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> i have sensitive dry skin this cream or should i say ointment is just like putting neosporin on my face .... oily with just a lil on the finger tips not worth more then a dollar.... but it is all organic product made of honey so maybe more then a dollar</li>
    <li> I used two times and some skin break out came out suddenly..&lt;br /&gt;So, I just stopped to using. May be it&#x27;s not the main reason of my skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;But smell is not really pleasant, and not well spread type.&lt;br /&gt;I went beck to Cetaphil now....</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s great this product is made with natural ingredients, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver what it claims to. I bought it to soothe my slightly sunburnt face hoping it would deeply moisturize it, but every morning I would wake up with a dry, dull complexion. I used it for a month to be fair, and came to the conclusion that it&#x27;s not better than Vaseline. Save your money and try something else!</li>
    <li> This is great if you get rashes from dry skin. I use it on my hands in the winter and it&#x27;s very thick and softening. I got my daughter some for her one year old with dry skin as well.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Great for chemotherapy patients.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine. Nothing special. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> nice but feels greasy. doesnt make me break out.. a little expensive... smell stronger than egyptian magic.. also this product is more liquidy than egyptian magic.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay.  I had high hopes after all the great reviews. I find it to be greasy and it just like a solid petroleum jelly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty magical. I was being driven mad by crazy cracking skin (on my elbows and feet) that was helped not in the least by half a dozen different creams. About three weeks of Sweet Bee Magic, which is closer to an ointment than a cream, and they were normal again. Wonderfully healing stuff.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It&#x27;s velvety smooth when it goes on and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  Who knows if it is actually doing any good but I love the texture.</li>
    <li> Good for dry skins, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> I slather this on my face daily. Its the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve used that gives me that baby soft glow. Plus its the consistency and smell of Bee discharge.</li>
    <li> After spending last winter in Eczema hell I stumbled across this awesome product. I have the most sensitive, reactive, allergy prone skin this side of the Mason Dixon line. I am 63 and have thinning dry skin. I was desperate for something to relieve the Eczema around my chin and mouth and this was literally God sent. I call it my new \\&quot;Best Friend\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I agree with another posting that this is a bit greasier than magic cream but it absorbs quickly and actually wasn&#x27;t as oily as I feared it might be. It does seem to work the same and I do like the product. Worth a try if you are looking for something less expensive that works like magic cream</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this, but it is nothing special.  Works well for an all over body moisturizer, but not so well for the face.  I have noticed no difference in my face after using this for two weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought Sweet Bee Magic for my hands and the stuff is so greasy I can&#x27;t touch anything for at least 30 minutes. And the scent is unpleasant. I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> i love it! usually i steer away from any new skin products because my skin is so sensitive but being that this was all natural with no dyes or perfumes i gave it a shot and i&#x27;m so happy i did! its fabulous thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> I like it, its a multi purpose product. I use it to put on the heels of my feel &amp; over night they are soft and amazing! a little goes a long way. This little jar will last a while.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels on my face. I use it nightly and have also used for others things like dry skin patches and my daughters rough spot</li>
    <li> This may or may not be perfect for really oily skin, but for my combination skin, it works wonders. My skin looks and feels 100% better after just 2 weeks of using it twice daily (morning and night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about, It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it doesn&#x27;t feel like Vaseline. It smells like herbal wax... and it has a greasy texture close to that of coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in to natural products, this ones for you!</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks. Moisturizing for the skin, soaks in quickly, does not clog pores. Try this on your hair too!! I have dry frizzy hair- this smooths and moisturizes better than any hair product I have tried. Wonderful as lip moisturizer as well. We use it all over and its fantastic. Natural, non toxic, yummy for the skin. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this product I use it every night after washing away my makeup. Makes my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> As a big fan of raw honey for all kinds of skin and hair care, I was looking for a product that incorporated honey, propolis, beeswax and/or other bee by products into a nonsticky, all purpose balm. I got a sample of Egyptian Magic and fell in love with it. Then I saw the price for a full-size tub. Eek! But Amazon offers Bee Magic, same ingredients, same size, less money. I have found Bee Magic to be as good as, if not better than Egyptian Magic. It is not greasy, absorbs quickly and has many uses. As a side note, for anyone with an oily complexion, this is great as a facial/eye hydrator; my oily skin has not gotten more oily or caused breakouts.</li>
    <li> It works! I used this to remove the sun burns I had and I saw that it works after a few uses.  Now, my skin is lighter not only my face but every part of my body that was sun burnt.  Next time I get sun burn I&#x27;ll now what to do!</li>
    <li> My sister bought Egytpian Magic; I bought this.  We both like this better.  A little goes a long way.  It doesn&#x27;t upset my very sensitive skin.  It promotes healing.</li>
    <li> this product made a dramatic difference in the texture and hydration of my skin almost immediately.  i&#x27;ve been suffering from extremely dry skin this fall and winter and nothing...i repeat...nothing was making a difference.  i tried raw shea butter, oil cleansing followed by facial oils, all kinds of moisturizers, and aloe with no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i am so happy i ordered this.  it is an exceptional product.  i will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> This stuff was a little greasy, so I didbt like it on my face, but on the body it was pretty good.</li>
    <li> I finished my 6 oz of Egyptian Magic Cream so I decided to buy this to give it a try since it was cheaper, and...nope :( not the same. Ended up buying Egyptian Magic again. Here&#x27;s the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Bee: more oily than creamy, was not absorbed very well (kinda just sits on your skin), had a stronger smell, color was darker and had a brown/green tint to it, did not melt into an oil as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Egyptian Magic: creamy, absorbs very well, almost no smell, light yellow/cream color, melts evenly into a creamy oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Sweet Bee didn&#x27;t work quite as well as Egyptian Magic for me. I&#x27;ll just spend the extra money on Egyptian Magic in the future.</li>
    <li> It makes skin trouble.</li>
    <li> I grew up with cocoa butter being the mainstay in our house, but this Sweet Bee Magic has quickly become a favorite of mine as well. It&#x27;s consistency is very favorable as are the results. Compared to the other product this most closely emulates, the Sweet Bee Magic is a steal.</li>
    <li> Loved it. An amazing line.</li>
    <li> Really helped the rash under my daughter&#x27;s eye. The only thing is it is very greasy.</li>
    <li> My husband is bothered by dry skin and this is the only cream that stops the itch immediately.  He scratches so much he bleeds, will be ordering again.  Thanks! finally something that actually works.</li>
    <li> I want to bathe in this! I wish it came in Tub size.  I love it but it does leave my face a little shiney (I don&#x27;t mind that), but be warned if you do mind.</li>
    <li> my husband has had cracked skin on his thumb for weeks (winter weather) and has been miserable. He&#x27;s tried a lot of different natural remedies, including vitamin E which has always worked in the past. His thumb was slowly getting better but still cracked, bloody, and not healing very fast. Last night he tried this bee magic at the store in the tester. we got it, and he put some more on at bedtime. this morning, the cracks have all healed and there is only chapped looking skin - which is a huge improvement. This stuff really works! I am amazed. great product - another satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be able to use a product on my face that contained pure oil in it... but this skin cream is amazing and has actually helped clear up my breakouts, scarring, tone, and texture of my face. I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone who has troubled skin. Even if you are hesitant because your face is already oily, sweet bee actually combats oil and makes your face less oily, all day long. My skin is softer than ever. I plan to continue using this for years to come!</li>
    <li> The product smells like stinkbugs.  I still use it because it is a good moisturizer.  I only use it on my feet so the smell is far away from my nose.  I slather on my feet and put on socks to moisturize overnight.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer which is why I gave it three stars. It is however, as others have mentioned, similar in consistency to Vaseline, limiting when/where you can apply it because it will leave you looking shiny and feeling oily. For the amount of honey and bee products included, I was hoping it would have a nicer scent. Unfortunately the only ingredient I can smell at all is the Olive Oil which isn&#x27;t very pleasant. It&#x27;s not terrible, I can think of worse odors, but I smell like a greased baking pan when I apply this.</li>
    <li> I use this around my eyes at night to help my eczema there. It is thick, almost like Vaseline, but with better stuff in it. It seems a little greasy, but I also put it on pretty thick. There is still a pretty thick layer when I wash my face in the morning. Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it, though I will be trying Egyptian Magic once it is gone as I&#x27;ve heard Egyptian Magic is a bit creamier. I almost feel as though Bee Magic would work best as something that goes over a cream that more easily absorbs into the skin. If Egyptian Magic does that I might end up using both together.</li>
    <li> The item is thick like chapstick, which I expected, however, it is full of thick hard granules. not sure if that&#x27;s how it was supposed to come? was excited for an all purpose moisturizer, unfortunately this is isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at whole foods and I&#x27;m so thrilled with it! I use it as an eye cream, spot treatment, and pretty much put it everywhere. I love that it&#x27;s organic and so effective! I had some scarring from a piercing that I&#x27;d taken out about two months ago. I applied this stuff nightly and slowly saw a great improvement! Two angry looking red spots are now almost gone! You can barely see them whereas before it was so much more obvious. The only thing is that this product is quite greasy so you have to use a very small amount. I recommend using it at night so that it can soak in and also using it as a spot treatment. You only need such a small amount so this bottle will probably last me forever!</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and cheaper than Egyptian Magic (maybe because it&#x27;s smaller, not sure). I have both and Bee Magic is a little less waxy and more oily and easier to spread. I think that I prefer it. It soaks in in about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Not finding much magic here - at least no change in skin appearance. But the product goes on nicely and feels good - will finish out tub for that reason alone.</li>
    <li> I use it on my many minor wounds, and on my new tattoos. love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really work, and I&#x27;m pissed because I&#x27;m allergic to it. Broke out, but my skin and hair was never as soft as when I was using this.</li>
    <li> This helped my son&#x27;s broken &amp; chapped skin, soothed my friend&#x27;s burn, makes my lips soft, and conditions my hair! Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought both this product and Egyptian Magic and over a month&#x27;s use I can say the  Egyptian magic is better absorbed overnight...no greasy feel in the morning, just rinse my face with hot water and put on my makeup.  At night use a olive oil/baby shampoo mixture to cleanse my skin completely.  This is a good product, but not as good as Egyptian magic, at least for my 62 year old skin.</li>
    <li> My friend turned me on to this, she successfully used it to fade acne scars.  I have tried several cheap and expensive face creams and never really noticed a difference good or bad.  But I do see a difference after using this stuff for several months.  It is greasy, but absorbs in the skin quickly.  Primarily, I use this as a night cream, and in the morning I can notice a bright moisturized look to my skin.  Personally, this stuff is too thick to use under makeup, but perhaps if I was doing foundation/concealer/powder/blush it would be fine.  It is safe to use under the eyes, and I have yet to break out.  I was surprised at the price, but after trying it you only need to use a tiny bit of the cream.  I see this jar lasting for many months-years.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love it but it just isn&#x27;t that wonderful.  It&#x27;s okay and 1/2 the price would have been fair, I think.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Really seems to offer relief for my son&#x27;s severe eczema. Not a miracle cure, but a great aid!</li>
    <li> I prefer Egyptian Magic.</li>
    <li> I will order this product again in a heart beat! It is a very soothing cream, even for the genital area. It can practically be used on any parts of the body. I will definitely order this cream again</li>
    <li> This is truly magic.  I had an extremely dry patch of skin on my elbow.  In a very short time, it&#x27;s gone.  I tried the Egyptian Crea,m first, it did not work.  Bee Magic is GREAT.  There are no chemicals or harmful ingredients in it either.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I read about this in a magazine at some point and tried to hunt it down locally.  Could not find it.  Ordered it and I have been very happy.  I started out with the 2 oz. jar and that has been plenty for me.  I tend to use them when I need something healing for dry skin patches, cuticles, etc.  I don&#x27;t use it as a regular everyday moisturizer at this point, but I would consider doing that when I run out of my other stuff.  I really like this product and will repurchase it.  I&#x27;ve used other honey-based moisturizers and this one has a consistency that I like (not too runny lotion-y, not a hard balm.  sort of in-between the 2).</li>
    <li> I love this balm, use it all the time on my face, hands and body. Highly emollient, very healing, non-comedogenic cream and has a very mild, pleasant aroma. If I have any cuts or irritation, this clears it up quickly. I even use it as an eye cream (being careful not to get it in my eyes) as it is great for retaining moisture. I will sometimes give myself a microdermabrasion treatment and put this on afterward and my skin just glows. I tend to have oily skin and break out easily but this does not make me break out at all. In fact, it seems to clear up my skin. It does make me quite shiny initially but, after a while, it soaks in and the shine diminishes. If I have to go out right away, a little mineral powder takes care of the shine. What a great find! I only wish I&#x27;d gotten the bigger container!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really &amp;#34;heals&amp;#34; but I think it does.  I put it over my dry spots.  I also like it for use right above the lipline when I have chapped lips.  I believe it prevents the painful cracking.</li>
    <li> Made in California! Perfect for nasty, dry cuticles. Even use it on my face. Absolutely a fabulous product for those with very dry skin!</li>
    <li> just okay..nothing special...it definitely has a specific smell that not everybody might like...</li>
    <li> So far so good. My sons chapped hands are looking great. I have the stick too for my other sons severely chapped lips and skin around his lips. Both seem to be helping. I&#x27;m seeing a better improvement on my sons hands using the jarred version but my other son has a nervous tic licking his lips very often so they will certainly be more challenging to heal. All in all, both go on very smoothly and feel great. It&#x27;s greasy for sure so be careful with your clothing but it feels great and helps tremendously.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping that it would give some relief to a particular skin problem that I have. Dermatologist recommended using a powder like &amp;#34;Gold Bond&amp;#34; which I did but was still having some issues. After reading about &amp;#34;Medicine Mama&amp;#34; I decided to give it a try. Glad that I did.</li>
    <li> This product works really great as a night moisturizer. I use both retin A and benzaclin for acne which are both very drying on my face. When I use this at night, my face is no longer dry. I also use this on my body which works equally as well. I should have kept record of how long it took to fix the dryness, because I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t overnight. But nonetheless, this product truly works. All these results were with moisturizing only at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also works great on lips too. My lips never get chapped if I rub this on it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is an extremely good alternative to Egyptian Magic. In my honest opinion however, if you can afford it, I would suggest getting Egyptian Magic instead. For me, Egyptian Magic made my skin feel more soft and moisturized. I mean Bee Magic certainly does the job, but it definitely never gave me that nice soft feeling Egyptian Magic did.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great stuff! Just like everybody says, it&#x27;s pretty greasy when first applied, absorbs quickly, it&#x27;s a fabulous moisturizer. Can&#x27;t wait to use it this winter!!!! Buy it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and very moisturizing without clogging pores!! No more 200 dollar cremes for me. I really do love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle lotion.  I gave some to my mother in law for some stitches she had, and hardly any scaring, plus it healed so fast.  I use it on my face which gets rid of fine lines, and acne.  It seems like it would be greasy, but it soaks in so well.  I love how soft it makes my lips too.  This stuff is Amazing!!!!!!!!  There are tons of other uses for it too like athletes foot, hair treatment, bug bites.  Oh I had a horrible skin thing on my fingers where the skin was rough and pealing.  It was gross!  I put some on and in a few days it was gone.  I tell everyone about it!</li>
    <li> This is great skin cream! I use it all the time. My skin is very sensitive and this never irritates it.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle.  Love the product.  I use it on my face and neck area.  Don&#x27;t have to apply much and it keeps my skin moisturized all day.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is comparable to Egyptian Magic, but it has a weird smell to it. I use this as lip balm, cuticle cream, tattoo moisturizer and face moisturizer mostly. I do not like to put much of it on my face. Its greasy so you can only use a tiny bit. Even then, I find I tend to break out more when I use it on my face, even though my face isnt as chapped/dry. I prefer the Egyptian Magic (brand) version of this product and when my Medicine Mamas tub is empty I will be paying extra to switch back.</li>
    <li> This cream is the BEST one I&#x27;ve ever use. It is goof for keeping moisture of my lips and face.I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
    <li> It much be real organic product which make the smell is not that good.&lt;br /&gt;Feel like appplying wax so I only use it with my knees and elbows.</li>
    <li> Not really all it&#x27;s cracked up to bee, so go ahead and ignore the buzz. Heavy ointment with a pleasant smell, but doesn&#x27;t sink into skin very well. Probably best as a barrier cream after face has been moisturized with something more absorbable.</li>
    <li> Love this stufff!! I put it on anything that needs moisturizing and it works great (especially great for razor irritation). I would recommend this to anyone looking for a propolis based moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like a lot... Just not the smell.</li>
    <li> My baby&#x27;s skin loves it. However I use it instead of Vaseline. It&#x27;s more natural and not toxic. Has some smell, but can&#x27;t decide if I like it. For some reason it&#x27;s cheaper in my local Whole foods ( usually everything there is overprised)</li>
    <li> My package arrived on time. I began to apply this to all of my dry skin. I live at a very high altitude (8,000) and I suffer from cracks, so deep in the heels of my feet they often bleed and make it painful to walk. I am not very old either; still a spring chic! My feet have not been in this good of a condition since I was in my early teens! I love this stuff, and put it on my lips and face too.</li>
    <li> Cream Smells and didn&#x27;t make my skin any better. Although can be used just as moisturizer only during night time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I planned to only use it here and there, on dry spots etc... but the more you use it the more you want to use it all over! I have to ration it out, because it can be quite addictive. It made a difference on my uneven/dark spots that evidently were due to chronic dryness and chafing. Hands and especially feet are smoother and more even in tone. Whats crazy is when I used it on my feet the dry skin just kind of slowly peeled off! I didn&#x27;t expect that! But it was great!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff.  It&#x27;s a little greasy at first, so only use a tiny bit.  My man says my face smells funny, but he&#x27;s gotten used to it.  Besides, the goal was soft clear skin.  Pretty much everything bothers my skin, but I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over a year and it&#x27;s wonderful.  I also use it on my kid&#x27;s minor cuts and scrapes.</li>
    <li> I love this product for the winter time! It&#x27;s a little too thick for summer. Makes you hold in heat I think. So I use something else, something lighter for summer. But in the winter who can&#x27;t use all the moisture this stuff provides plus a little heat! I have used this product for over a year.</li>
    <li> A coworker recommended this product and I love it. I also gifted a cream to a friend whose going through chemo and her skin is in bad condition. Its great to know this is organic and has all natural creamy goodness.</li>
    <li> The only creme that works for my daughters psoriasis!! And great for my &#x27;old lady&#x27; skin...dry. Smells very wonderful and calming. I will definitely buy more!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product or the smell. A harder version of Vaseline. Leaves a greasy residue on your skin. If you use it on your feet, better put sox on as it stains the sheets</li>
    <li> I used to love EM. I purchased EM about three times, before I began experiencing some problems. I purchased one at Whole Foods and there was something wrong with it -discolored, hard, bad smell. I returned it and then purchased some off of Amazon -same problem, only the smell was even worse, like cigarette smoke. Since then I&#x27;ve heard rumors of counterfeit EM, but I think it&#x27;s likely a quality control issue. Either way, I decided I didn&#x27;t want to go to so much trouble to buy something so expensive. When I saw this Sweet Bee Cream I was intrigued, particularly because it has the same ingredients yet a competitive price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a different consistency than EM, but not by much. It&#x27;s less creamy and has a lower melting point. The smell is different, but I actually find it more pleasant. Honey and beeswax. My skin absorbs it well and it has been very soothing on my dry, sensitive skin. I recently developed rosacea, so this cream is invaluable to me. I bought a 2oz. before Christmas 2013 and still have plenty left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to EM fans looking for a less expensive option and to anyone who is struggling with sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
    <li> Terrific stuff for our winter weather when keeping hands moist is necessary! A bit sticky but it rubs in well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;ve not used Egyptian Magic, but for all those people comparing the two, one thing you should consider (if it matters to you ... and it should), is that not only is Medicine Mamas Sweet Bee Magic less expensive, it&#x27;s ingredients are certified organic, and Egyptian Magic&#x27;s are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I wanted to point out to people who put it on their face and find it too greasy, you are most likely using way too much. Right after cleansing, while your face is still damp, scoop up an amount no larger than the size of half of a small pea. Rub this between the fingertips on both hands, and then lightly pat, pat, pat your fingertips around your face and down onto your neck (it will seem like you don&#x27;t have enough and that there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;ll be able to get it to all blend together on your whole face and neck, but don&#x27;t worry). Then using the full flat of your fingers, lightly blend it in upwards strokes. The warmth of your skin will start allowing the areas where you touched it on to \\&quot;bleed\\&quot; into one another so that you can get it to blend over your whole face. Your skin should feel dewy, with a slight moistness to it, but not greasy. If it feels slick or greasy, you should use even less. After about 10 minutes, your skin should just feel soft and smooth, with no noticeable residue. I&#x27;ve been using this at night and my skin is looking really healthy ... smooth, plump, with much better color. I&#x27;m feeling comfortable enough to go without foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also used it on some bug bites, which for some reason I&#x27;m very sensitive (possibly allergic) to. They always seem to take forever to heal, frequently get infected, and usually leave marks that can last for 6 months or more. The Bee Magic healed them in about half the normal time, the red area stayed small and contained rather than spreading like it usually does, and the marks are much lighter than normal. It&#x27;s only been about a week, so I think these will fade completely in probably less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mine as a generous sample at my health food store and was checking here to price compare, because I&#x27;m definitely going to buy a jar now that I&#x27;ve seen what it can do. That&#x27;s the other thing, it&#x27;s super concentrated so it will last a long time too.</li>
    <li> This product is very hard to find ESPECIALLY unscented, for those of us who don&#x27;t like to marinate ourselves in phony perfumy scents. It is the exact consistency I was getting from a local beekeeper (now retired). Could NOT find unscented Royal Bee Jelly w/Propolis anywhere. NOT going to pay astronomical prices for it.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it so sparingly, this should last me a long time. I&#x27;ll be keeping the info on the source of this product too, so I can find it again &amp;#34;down the road&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference with this.  It worked like every other balm/salve.  I am not sure about the hype.</li>
    <li> A great all in one product for cuts, dry skin, etc. It&#x27;s more like a salve than a cream; much like \\&quot;Egyptian Magic\\&quot;. The main ingredients are the same, Med.Mamas price is much better.</li>
    <li> Worst part is that it is greasy, does not absorb very well. Best used at night, or if you have a bad spot, under a bandage. Smells good, works well, but that greasiness is a killer for me.</li>
    <li> This is a very greasy product and goes on thick. I am not sure of the results because I hesitate to use it too much or too often. I have dry skin and early signs of aging, so I will continue to search.</li>
    <li> I have used Egyptian Magic as well, and the only difference that I can tell between the two is the texture, like other people have pointed out.  Egyptian Magic is solid and you almost have to apply a little pressure to get the product out, and then warm it up in your hands.  Bee Magic is softer and doesn&#x27;t need to be warmed before application.  I honestly find no huge preference between the two textures, but do feel that this formula is easier to spread over larger areas, such as legs.  I am currently using Bee Magic on a burn, after shaving, on my cuticles, and feet- you can pretty much put it anywhere!  This is a great, natural product with a multitude of uses.</li>
    <li> It works.  I am a 43 year old man but most people guess I&#x27;m 35.  I have fair skin and I don&#x27;t use sun block but I like to try and get a tan every now and then.  I started using a tanning bed and that worked for tanning but it quickly damaged my skin on my face.  The radiation in the tanning bed gave me sun spots that I never got with the natural sun.  I only have tanned about 12 times in two years but I&#x27;m not going to use a tanning bed any more.  This product works GREAT on sun spots and dry skin as I have combination skin,</li>
    <li> Outstanding for extremely dry skin.  Very nourishing without being very oily.  I am on my second jar and don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
    <li> wonderful product, I love it  ;)</li>
    <li> It is AMAZiNG cream. I have to say..I do not like how it feels when you put it on.. It feels like you are putting lip cream all over your face. But it&#x27;s worth it. You will see the result next morning. I got so much complement how my skin got better after using this. I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great face cream. It&#x27;s good for a night cream, otherwise it might be too greasy.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and gentle. Excellent for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fixing the dry skin on my finger better than any other moisturizing product in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this! I had been sent a sample of Egyptian Magic in a Birchbox, and I liked that a lot, but wanted to find a more natural version. This one is both cheaper and higher quality! I use it on my face, body, anytime I get a cut or scrape, and even used it to heal a new tattoo. The tattoo came out beautifully. This little jar will last me forever because I use so little at a time. Great product; I&#x27;ll be using this for life.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. have used on my face and body, feet - wonderful product. Will be a staple in my house.</li>
    <li> I use at  night during the summer. I am looking forward to using during winter  to ward off dry skin</li>
    <li> I bought this product on Amazon and am very happy.  I have only had it a week and have used it in a cut/scar.  It is healing it quickly.  I am so excited.  Also, my husband is trying it on his toenail fungus and it is already looking better.  And It works great on my cold sore.  Stopped the inflammation.  I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because other reviews were comparing it to the famous Egyptian Magic. I really liked this product, it really helped with my dry skin, I was hoping it would help with some dry patches of skin near my scalp but it worked as well as regular lotion. I would buy it again and recommend it because I love the price, the natural ingredients and it lasted a very long time!</li>
    <li> I got really itchy reddish neck rash during summer time, and this little thing really helps! Just take a bunch after shower, the rash is all gone after a few days.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful. I purchased it having some doubts about whether it would be effective, but after using it, I&#x27;m quite impressed. It&#x27;s worked well on dry skin, cuts, and bug bites. And it feels very nice on the skin and smells pretty good, too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! I suffer from sensitive skin due to my eczema. I tried many drugstore lotions to get rid of dry spots under my eyes and cheeks. The dry spots were very frustrating when applying make up, so I would have to wait for the spots to disappear in order to wear any make up. A little sure goes a long way and has lasted me two months and counting!! Worth the investment 😉</li>
    <li> Works well on dry patches of skin.  If you use on large area; make sure you realize it will leave an oily mark.  It does come out in wash with a little pretreat of Dawn.  Also used on hands and covered with latex surgical gloves for an hour.  Softness lasted pretty much all day.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel anything besides it doesn&#x27;t dry my dry type face.&lt;br /&gt;But my daughter which has pimple on her face said it helped pimple disapear.&lt;br /&gt;So I gave 5star.</li>
    <li> This product works great for just about anything and everything- it&#x27;s like the &amp;#34;windex&amp;#34; treatment from that movie about the Greek wedding. I can put it on my dry skin, patchy elbows, knees, feet for a deep overnight treatment, lips. I was using it a little bit for my face, but it tended to clog up the pores on my nose and chin, but for my cheeks, it was fine. It really probably is too thick for facial use. I will still use it for around the eyes, also use it for scars. Promotes quick healing, all natural. This product has lasted about a year and a half. Great purchase!</li>
