      <li>I loved the way this product made my skin look and feel, it really made a difference over what I was using before.</li>
      <li>My skin looks clean and the application is so easy and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Product was shipped and received very quickly.</li>
      <li>Some face washes have a strong smell, and some are designed to \\&quot;wake up\\&quot; your face with menthol; I don&#x27;t like either of those things.  </li>
      <li>Why not try something new!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product packaging, and my first encounter with the product I did not like the smell.</li>
      <li>Absolutely as described and more!</li>
      <li>Nice texture, light lather, nice smell, rinses easily, and leaves your face feeling clean but not dry.</li>
      <li>Great to find products that are specifically for mens facial needs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the following oil-based products and experienced immediate break-out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells like a cheap air freshener and makes me sneeze.</li>
      <li>I have not heard much about kyoku, but it is a line people need to get more acquainted with.</li>
      <li>It also has a good natural scent to it.</li>
      <li>Amazing product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great facial cleanser that is natural and works.</li>
      <li>I always thought soap and water and you were clean.  </li>
      <li>Kiss My Face Organic Clean for a Day Creamy Face Cleanser, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nothing special.  </li>
      <li>Not that it&#x27;s a huge issue but it does seem to take a bit more effort to work into a good lather compared to other face washes I&#x27;ve tried, but the end result feels worth it.</li>
      <li>A good daily cleanser with salicylic acid.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had good results with all Kiss My Face skin care products, such as [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>fresh oil free face, I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend</li>
      <li>is a great product, at the beginning is a little bit strong for the face, but after a while, I see the difference.</li>
      <li>When I first used it my face felt super clean.!</li>
      <li>Leaves the skin feeling clean and fresh without drying.</li>
      <li>The best daily facial scrub for men on the market.</li>
      <li>Best daily facial cleanser I have ever used</li>
      <li>This is an excellent daily facial cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Yes, definitely my new cleanser!!!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a fresh, cool feeling when it&#x27;s put on the  face</li>
      <li>My new favorite cleanser</li>
      <li>Does a great job at removing dead skin and oil from your face.</li>
      <li>, butI guess the price of Suki products are worth the headache of getting basic drugstore products in nice looking containers (Kyoku).  </li>
      <li>face is so fresh after using it</li>
      <li>Defiantly worth your money.</li>
      <li>Id recommend getting right to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to moving on to the Suki line of facial products because I saw more noticeable results with the trial sample I got and didn&#x27;t make me breakout as quickly as Kyoku.&lt;br</li>
      <li>had been using it in conjunction with Kyoku moisturizer and experienced small ripe pimples (about to pop) within 2 ~ 3 times of use.</li>
      <li>There was nothing particularly exceptional about this product compared to other cheaper face wash I have used before.  </li>
      <li>, best part is this product doesn&#x27;t make your skin feeling all dry like some other products do.</li>
      <li>I suppose I am lucky to even have found this line really.</li>
      <li>When you use this with the mosturizer by Kyoku it makes your skin feel so good and less oily than others.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> fresh oil free face, I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> Does a decent job of cleaning and leaves the skin feeling refreshed.  Seems to remove the dirt and oil buildup easily without drying out the skin too much, I also use the Kyoku facial scrub as well as part of the cleaning regiment.  A little dab goes a long way of foaming up.  There was nothing particularly exceptional about this product compared to other cheaper face wash I have used before.  It seems to do the job as well as any other I&#x27;ve used before.  My skin is not as sensitive as some other so perhaps this is more suitable for those individuals</li>
    <li> Love this! It cleans very well but does not dry my skin out. I typically have very sensitive skin on my face, but this cleanser does a great job of balancing that out. Excellent!</li>
    <li> This stuff has a great menthol feel/smell, is heavy enough to clean but not so heavy it feels gross or is hard to get off. Keeps my face feeling clean without being dry, and a little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s good  stuff. Just expensive.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped and received very quickly. Box and tube in excellent condition, unopened. Product is very good. I&#x27;m becoming a big fan of kyoku products.  Would absolutely buy again.</li>
    <li> It only takes a small amount and leaves your face feeling great. No dryness or redness, but a pore opening feeling that feels refreshing.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! My face feels great with this cleanser!</li>
    <li> Good product that does what you expect. Nice texture, light lather, nice smell, rinses easily, and leaves your face feeling clean but not dry. I would have preferred this in a pump for easier, less messy use.</li>
    <li> Irritated my skin slightly less than the scrub, but ultimately dissatisfied. Won&#x27;t try Kyoku anymore.</li>
    <li> The best daily facial scrub for men on the market. Period. If you care about spending money on your personal skin care, you&#x27;ll never go back to anything else</li>
    <li> I loved the way this product made my skin look and feel, it really made a difference over what I was using before. It smells really great too. However it is a little to expensive for me to afford regularly right now.</li>
    <li> is a great product, at the beginning is a little bit strong for the face, but after a while, I see the difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend - he loves it and I find myself using it too!  You need a very small amount to lather up your face and neck - nice smell and simple ingredients.  Leaves your skin feeling clean but not too dry.  Just buy it!</li>
    <li> As the title states, I have acne prone skin and was looking forward to the product. It is very hard to tell if the product helps reducing acne since I continue to break out on occasion. Also, please note that it contains sunflower oil which makes it hard to tell if the cleanser is off your face or not after rinsing it with water. Smells nice though. Okay price. Okay size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using it in conjunction with Kyoku moisturizer and experienced small ripe pimples (about to pop) within 2 ~ 3 times of use. I figured it has to be the moisturizer since cleanser doesn&#x27;t usually cause acne. I stopped using the moisturizer and went back to old lotion I used to use and small acne stopped appearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, I realize both Kyoku products contain oil in them. I&#x27;m beginning to suspect that oil has to be the part of the reason behind continued appearance of acne on my face. I get that oil in facial products do not cause acne in some people. However, personally, I have been experiencing negative effects of oil-based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the following oil-based products and experienced immediate break-out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyoku moisturizer with SPF-15&lt;br /&gt;Burts Bee Acne Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Kyoku Daily Facial Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave three stars because the product didn&#x27;t worsen nor improve my skin from one month of usage.</li>
    <li> Kyoku facial products have been my favorite ever since I started using them. Great to find products that are specifically for mens facial needs. They used to be over priced but recently became more reasonable. I love the way that this cleanser gets rid of all the gunk off of my face without making it feel dried out. It also has a good natural scent to it. I always have problems with acne in the summer because I work outside and sweat a lot. This product is amazing at clearing it up and keeping it away. Amazing product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great facial cleanser that is natural and works.</li>
    <li> Best daily facial cleanser I have ever used, best part is this product doesn&#x27;t make your skin feeling all dry like some other products do.</li>
    <li> I have pretty normal skin, and I rarely get pimples or breakouts. I use a men&#x27;s Neutrogena cleanser regularly with decent results but wanted something more powerful. With this face wash, my face broke out immediately. Disgusting stuff, going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Felt the improvement to my skin immediately after the first application. I&#x27;m definitely going to be a lifelong customer</li>
    <li> Absolutely as described and more! Everyone who&#x27;s on the fence try this now! You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
    <li> Did nothing. Better results with washing with a bar of soap and I would never ever do that. Don&#x27;t fall for this brands hype. Overpriced products and they do not work. Just clog pores and lead to breakouts from ingredients.</li>
    <li> As man, I don&#x27;t quite understand difference Facial Cleanser. So give a 5 star anyway.</li>
    <li> This came as a strong recommendation from a friend, but the whole product line is terrible and over-priced.  The cleanser is pretty harsh and drying and did not even fully prevent breakouts while leaving skin either dry or red and irritated.  I used the entire product line according to their instructions and I&#x27;ve had better results with other less expensive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this and spend it on trying something else.</li>
    <li> Really three and half stars.  A good daily cleanser with salicylic acid.  Does not dry out skin.  Would prefer if it had less chemicals, but it is more affordable than other daily cleansers in this overpriced market with comparable results.  The Kyoku exfoliating scrub is somewhat better, but is not supposed to be used daily.  For the record, there is no earthly reason why any daily cleanser should have &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The key *marketed* ingredients are the likes of ginseng, peppermint leaf, and sunflower oil - which appear on the actual real ingredient list only after 10 hard-to-pronounce chemicals. The first ingredient besides water? Sodium Laureth Sulfate (google it) - a cheap foamer which has been subject to thousands of tests; with mostly one result: it is potentially very harmful long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because I thought the Kyoku brand stood for natural, toxic-free ingredients, so I&#x27;m disappointed in the daily cleanser.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product, it actually works, smells great, cleans great. I use it once a day and my acne is gone and only reappears when I stop using these product for 1 week+</li>
    <li> I love the scrub but this product leaves me wanting a better clean or more pleasant smell. Just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The whole Kyoku product line is great. When you use this with the mosturizer by Kyoku it makes your skin feel so good and less oily than others. I have never had a break out with this product and I only use it once a day in the morning. My face with other products usually doesn&#x27;t react well and would either turn really red or dry. This product smells like a light mint smell (which doesn&#x27;t last and goes away a couple minutes, usually before you get out of the shower) and a little portion goes a long way. Defiantly worth your money.</li>
    <li> This cleanser has a clean masculine scent. A small amount goes a long way. A pencil eraser sized dollop easily produces enough lather to do both my face and neck. Skin is squeaky clean after use and much less oily in between uses.</li>
    <li> It throughly cleans your face and smells good. But it may dries your skin in winter. Overall, i like this facial wash.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash.  It smells great and is not harsh at all.</li>
    <li> Just tried this for the sake of trying something different and if given the chance would go back to Neutrogena for Men. It&#x27;s not as strong and nourishing as some of the bigger brand names out there...</li>
    <li> -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know this product contains artificial ingredients that are likely to cause a major breakout on your face. This product is not all-natural. It smells like a cheap air freshener and makes me sneeze. One of the ingredients is \\&quot;Fragrance.\\&quot;  Also it is colored bright blue, another chemical artificial ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any expert esthetician will tell you that different people respond to the same chemical ingredients differently. My facial skin type is NORMAL. Never oily and never dry. I do not have any pimples or bumps or blemishes. And I never did before using this product. My face was smooth, and I use facial cleanser and a weekly masque only to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Bad Results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of using [[ASIN:B003040T0Y Kyoku for Men Daily Facial Cleanser, 3.4 Fluid Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B002ZSW7OC Kyoku for Men Lava Masque, 5 Ounce]], I have pimples all over my face.  I will never use Kyoku products again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Recommendation for You:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal facial skin, you should use only all-natural ingredients on your face. I&#x27;ve had good results with all Kiss My Face skin care products, such as [[ASIN:B001FB5H60 Kiss My Face Organic Clean for a Day Creamy Face Cleanser, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware - Just because it is expensive doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t ruin your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
    <li> My new favorite cleanser</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser for woman to. Really cleans your face well.  It&#x27;s good to switch off to a scrub., this company has a good one. After I wash I use a small amount of non-oily moisturizer. This product leaves your face so clean and a tad dry, but if you wait about 5 min after washing the dry feeling will go away.</li>
    <li> I used this product once and immediately loved it. It smells nice and you can feel it cleaning. Afterwards I followed up with an acne lotion (oil-free) and my face has never felt so clean and soft let alone the physical appearance of my skin looked tighter and younger. Will buy again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I use Dove Men&#x27;s face lotion in the morning for all day protection. Additionally, I use an exfoliating cleanser twice a week along with Kyoku Lava Masque (must by, will not regret) twice a week. Skin looks and feels better now than ever!</li>
    <li> Some of the best stuff I have ever used, this is amazing and smells great. It cleans your skin without the extremely dry feeling of most cleansers.</li>
    <li> Love this wash!!! Only use in the morning an it cleans me up really well as well as their lava masque and exfoliate every now and then keeps me clear!!!</li>
    <li> A little pricey but leaves my face feeling very clean and soft, in fact I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used a face wash that left my skin feeling so soft and prepped for shaving.  Not that it&#x27;s a huge issue but it does seem to take a bit more effort to work into a good lather compared to other face washes I&#x27;ve tried, but the end result feels worth it.</li>
    <li> This is Step one of my new skin care routine right before exfoliating it helps prep the surface as it where and opens up my pores and skin for deeper cleaning and repair. If your just now getting started with taking care of your skin Id recommend getting right to it. You will thank yourself not only 10 years from now but more likely 10 days from now.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent daily facial cleanser.  It can be used everyday without reddening or drying out your skin.  Does a great job at removing dead skin and oil from your face.</li>
    <li> This product  did not work well at all for me as I had a very serious skin allergic reaction to this product line.</li>
    <li> Very similar to having kum on your face,when dry just peel it off and it cleans!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a fresh, cool feeling when it&#x27;s put on the  face and I do feel like it is cleansing.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I used to use bar soap, clean and clear, and proactiv refining mask for my face (all shots in the dark being a guy who doesn&#x27;t know anything about facial or skin care) until my girl recommended an exfoliator.  I usually drink coffee and stay stressed out all day at work and sometimes it comes through on my face in maybe 3-4 pimple breakouts on a stressful week, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I have acne problems or an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; face.  I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing out on, this stuff makes my skin feel tight and clean for almost the entire day.  It cleared up any acne I had, and I&#x27;ve yet to have any breakouts except for people breaking out to complement my flawless skin (haha jk).  It really does work however, I&#x27;m buying for life.</li>
    <li> not much different than other daily cleansers, not very thick so be careful when opening it up</li>
    <li> i like it. seems to work well buts its tough to review a cleanser because its tough to measure how well it truly works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: doesnt seem to over-dry my skin or irritate my face either&lt;br /&gt;  smells great&lt;br /&gt;  washes off easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: contains parabens and sulfates&lt;br /&gt;  ingredients listed on the front seem to be more of a sales pitch then anything.</li>
    <li> This product contains Sodium Laureth  Sulfate, a known carcinogen.  I.e. it is a substance capable of causing cancer in living tissue.</li>
    <li> Very good face wash that does not dry out my face or leave it oily.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and it seems to be a great sensitive cleaner for his face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few cleansers and this one takes the cake. Love the scent and goes on and washes off well. Bang for your buck for a designer-caliber cleanser.</li>
    <li> My face has started getting a glow after using this and the Kyoku mask. Much better than the brands that you get at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Good size for a dopp kit. Leaves your face clean but not dried out.</li>
    <li> I am 40 years old and just recently began to use product on my skin.  I must say that this cleanser is truly the real deal.  My skin looks clean and the application is so easy and refreshing.  You literally only need a pea size amount to cleanse the whole face.  Yes, definitely my new cleanser!!!!  Thank you Kyoku!</li>
    <li> face is so fresh after using it</li>
    <li> These products have been my go to since I purchased their gift box set back in 2012. I use all of their line now.</li>
    <li> This face wash is great.  It has a nice tingly feeling and smells like peppermint but doesn&#x27;t burn or leave a scent.  Great for acne as well, I have less blemishes now and recommend to everyone.  I keep trying more kyoku products and have been very pleased by them all.</li>
    <li> I like the way this cleans my face without drying.  Only takes a little.  I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner.  Cuts the grime without over drying.  Very little needed so it last forever.  Very bubbly</li>
    <li> The effect is very good and great is a little expensive. But I still really like, I will buy them.</li>
    <li> It is hard to wash and I feel a little dried after using it.  The facial cleanser is not bad, but the price is expensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty mild facial cleanser that I was introduced to via trial samples and I thought that based off the reviews from Amazon that the natural ingredients would be helpful in controlling random breakouts and heavy oil build up throughout the day.  The trial sample wasn&#x27;t enough to see a consistent reproducibility in effect on my face so I decided to go with the pairing of the Kyoku scrub and this facial cleanser.  After a week so far I have noticed an increase in breakouts/blemishes and HEAVY drying (i rarely use moisturizer because I have oily facial skin that seemingly secretes moisture/oil constantly).  Following the use of this cleanser with the scrub (as directed) only made the situation worse; in fact, I have never felt my face burn while exfoliating like I did when using the line.  Almost as if I was getting a slight chemical peel.  This is suppost to have all natural ingredients?  As far as oil control, this product dosen&#x27;t make any difference when compared to your regular drugstore products (ie Clean&amp;Clear, etc.)  I will update this to see if it&#x27;s just an initial reaction to the change in products, like if this is just the storm before the calm.  But so far I am not satisfied.  I&#x27;m looking forward to moving on to the Suki line of facial products because I saw more noticeable results with the trial sample I got and didn&#x27;t make me breakout as quickly as Kyoku.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with Kyoku based on the reviews and pricetag, butI guess the price of Suki products are worth the headache of getting basic drugstore products in nice looking containers (Kyoku).  Secondly, I just want to point out that I understand that not all people have the same skin conditions so I may be the lemon that this product line didn&#x27;t work for; with that said I believe genetics plays a role in this realm so please take the following information with respect: I am a male Pacific Islander in my mid-twenties.</li>
    <li> This is quite certainly the best face wash I have ever used, and I have used many. I suppose I am lucky to even have found this line really. I have not heard much about kyoku, but it is a line people need to get more acquainted with. This does not over dry my face like so many that claim they wont, do. It also makes my face look great and gives it a healthy glow. One added bonus is the smell of this stuff, it is incredible. I have never smelled anything like it before and it is very unique. It lasts a long time as well; a small pea sized bit is all you need. Buy this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a face wash user since my teenage years and I&#x27;ve evolved from brand to brand over the years-- usually when one is discontinued I move on. My current regular face wash is Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask, but I left it in a hotel in Berlin and ordered one of this to be at my destination upon arrival back in the US. Why not try something new!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product packaging, and my first encounter with the product I did not like the smell. Second, the product was a bit too watery for me, but I did use it for a week and determined that it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as clean as I had hoped. It&#x27;s totally usable and I wouldn&#x27;t proactively throw it away and replace it, but it definitely didn&#x27;t edge out what I am already using or cause me to consider moving to this face wash permanently.</li>
    <li> Very ordinary.  Nothing special.  Disappointed with their line of products.  Also purchase eye fuel - absolutely no effects or results.  Looking to try another line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kyoku products for several months now (face wash, scrub, and lotion).  I&#x27;ve had horrible skin since 13(I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s now) and tried it all:  Proactive, Accutane, SkinID, dermatologist prescribed creams, and off the shelf products.  Since implementing Kyoku products into my daily routine a few months ago my skin has improved tenfold.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine using anything else now.  Daily I use: Kyoku Facial Cleanser &gt; Anthony Logistics Toner Pads &gt; Kyoku Face Lotion.  Once a week I&#x27;ll use the Kyoku Face Scrub directly after the Kyoku Facial Cleanser and Menscience Face Mask (I&#x27;ll try the Kyoku Lava Masque once this runs out).</li>
    <li> this is the product that give me what I looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;cleans you&#x27;re pores.&lt;br /&gt;fresh and not leaving dry sensation.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 15 year old son along with the facial scrub and moisturiser. has done wonders for his skin. I&#x27;ve tried the scrub and I love it! Leaves my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband but I use it all the time. I like it better than my cleanser. It smells so clean and has the best slip and rich lather. As they say in the Irish Spring commercial....&amp;#34;Manly, yes, but I like it too&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Ingredients sound good, but it looks artificial and has no smell.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Feels awesome in my face. Usually means my skin feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell, and this product is really doing a good job, feel like it is natural, the only thing is, it is half empty, ran out in 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product has worked well for me</li>
    <li> What a nice pleasant scent. Leaves the skin feeling clean and fresh without drying. A little goes a long way. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Really great smell. Works like a dream. Cost is rough though for the value. Bottle smaller than I&#x27;d hope for.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a moth. This stuff works really well. When I first used it my face felt super clean.!</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser so far. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your face and it seems to be working. I&#x27;ll give it a little bit more time now as I&#x27;m not really seeing the results I was expecting but I&#x27;m also not seeing the opposite</li>
    <li> It gives a refreshing feeling and my wife and barber noticed the difference.  I always thought soap and water and you were clean.  I never noticed any problem with my face but my wife and barber noticed.  My Barber would hit me with a scrub every time I went in (every three weeks)  My wife suggested I try one at home along with this Facial Cleaner and it feels refreshing and my wife and barber have noticed the change in my skin.  I use the whole Kyoku line and since then I have not had dry or damaged skin anymore.  I guess my face was probably dry or something but the rest of my skin was so jacked up i didn&#x27;t notice.  I tell you having skin that feels normal again is awesome.  (I live in a harsh climate and swim five days a week so I really do a number on my skin. This is the only product that I have found that takes care of my skin.)</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this and I like it.  Some face washes have a strong smell, and some are designed to \\&quot;wake up\\&quot; your face with menthol; I don&#x27;t like either of those things.  Kyoku is different.  The smell is very subtle and good.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re washing your face with icy-hot either, it just cleans off the dirt and oil.  The only reason it gets 4/5 stars is it&#x27;s pretty expensive.</li>
