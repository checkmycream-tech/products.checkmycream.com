      <li>This is the best eyeliner ive ever used!</li>
      <li>Great buy!</li>
      <li>This is the best gel eyeliner that I have tried.  </li>
      <li>the brush that comes with it is awesome.</li>
      <li>This seems like a great deal but it wasn&#x27;t for me, I need to use waterproof because in Arizona I literally sweat off my makeup</li>
      <li>BUT this eyeliner is great.</li>
      <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;The brush included is actually very nice quality, so that&#x27;s another star.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I wanted to see how good gel formula was.</li>
      <li>It went on good, but faded during the day and disappeared.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
      <li>Best eye liner ever, it was very smooth and easy to put on.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>My aunt is a makeup artist and she loved it better then MAC</li>
      <li>and it still smudged a great deal, and it continued smudging right through the day.</li>
      <li>It stayed on well, and its easy to apply!</li>
      <li>This is an okay eyeliner.</li>
      <li>But the more you use it is when it starts to clump up.</li>
      <li>the gel had redistributed the eyeliner to the top of my lids and lower lids as well.  </li>
      <li>Glad I tried it at home before going out of the house with it.  </li>
      <li>I love the brush as well</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>The packaging was smashed, but I love the eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner</li>
      <li>Overall this is a good gel and a great value.</li>
      <li>I love the brush that came with it</li>
      <li>It smudges and smears on the top lid, lower lid, lashline,</li>
      <li>It last all day and looks wonderful.  </li>
      <li>, i would have purchased more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it to line my top and bottom lids.</li>
      <li>Not only that but a $1 liner pencil can do a better job!!!   </li>
      <li>Stays on all day and smudges easily for that smoky eye look.</li>
      <li>It is easily applied to the brush and eye.  </li>
      <li>Smears easy</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and easily.</li>
      <li>smudges with contact with water, like tears or sweat or fine morning dew in the air.  </li>
      <li>its very very runny and spreads very easily</li>
      <li>It glides on so smooth.</li>
      <li>Thanks Starry!!!</li>
      <li>but on the top it looks good and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>and you still get a rich color.</li>
      <li>Overall I was pretty happy with it.</li>
      <li>, I actually think the brush is good too 😊</li>
      <li>It smudges with contact with oil, like the kind your eyes naturally produce or from irritated eyes.  </li>
      <li>I think eyeliner from the modern era should be able to work without nursing it all</li>
      <li>But with this product, it takes whole a lot of stress off from my shoulders by providing smooth and precise application.  </li>
      <li>But other than that it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
      <li>Very easy and smooth to apply lasting all day.  </li>
      <li>brush is not of a v great quality, i use a previous eyeliner brush.</li>
      <li>It smudges when rubbed or when left to its own devices.  </li>
      <li>but it was worth</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s one of my favorites right now</li>
      <li>Lastly this eyeliner smears very easily.</li>
      <li>If you use it to line the bottom, be aware if any of the liner gets on your lashes, you will have lash marks on your face all day.</li>
      <li>nice, just what I expected.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner starts off pretty well when your first get it.</li>
      <li>It does not look funny</li>
      <li>I would suggest only using this on the top lashline, though, so it won&#x27;t run and make you look like a raccoon.</li>
      <li>I love this item and will definitely purchase additional colors!</li>
      <li>Not even smudge as in, mild normal corner of the eye.</li>
      <li>I was in search of a highly pigmented gel liner and did not want to spend the cash on MAC Chromaline or Inglot AMC Gel Liner right away.</li>
      <li>This gel goes on easy enough, but.......  </li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s actually a pretty good eyeliner, especially for a gel.</li>
      <li>It goes on really creamy, but it&#x27;s also kind of heavy.</li>
      <li>Also, the more you use the brush, the harder it gets to apply so</li>
      <li>It glides on very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and</li>
      <li>At first I was a little scared because I never tried a gel eyeliner before,im more of a liquid eyeliner girl</li>
      <li>One star is added extra since it&#x27;s so richly</li>
      <li>Added bonus: The brush it comes with is nice and small and does a decent job!</li>
      <li>It works well with a natural eyeshadow and a nice wing or dark smokey</li>
      <li>Haha I highly recommned this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Easy to brush on and its so less messy, love it!</li>
      <li>This product was decent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The shade is very black and rich but has a translucency that makes it easy to sheer out.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure to wipe off the brush when done, it tends to get stiff.</li>
      <li>The brush that comes with it is very good about only using a little bit of the gel to go a long way, so it&#x27;ll last practically forever.</li>
      <li>But it smudges pretty easily, especially since I have to moisturize my face.</li>
      <li>The color is correct, but the texture of the product is a little greasy, and smears so easily.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s very soft but sturdy enough to make a straight or curvy line(your in control of the brush).</li>
      <li>I was excited to have an eyeliner that would stay on my waterline, but it fell down in seconds.</li>
      <li>Do NOT waste money on this overpriced product.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner goes on very smoothly and a little goes a very long way!</li>
      <li>However, when you first apply it on your eyes, it&#x27;s crucial that you dry them off, or else, that gel will get all over the place.  </li>
      <li>The brush is much easier to handle on my eyes, and it really last long.  </li>
      <li>My right eye has a slight thicker double-lid than my left eye.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t really looking for a expensive famous eye liner , just a high quality black eyeliner tbh</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really too bad because it goes on amazingly but comes off and gets all over the place.</li>
      <li>Be careful about how much you use as it can get heavy and smear if you use to much.</li>
      <li>It works, but it is not long lasting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very easy and smooth to apply lasting all day.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I &#x27;bent&#x27; the brush that came with it to make application even easier. This eyeliner goes on very smoothly and a little goes a very long way! If you don&#x27;t use a foundation on your eyelid and put a little shadow or powder over the liner it will mark your eyelid crease but I always wear foundation and shadow on my lids and don&#x27;t have a problem. I have not used on my water line but I would guess it would not stay well. Overall this is a good gel and a great value.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner SMEARS everywhere!! It is extremely messy, not recommended at all! I thought I could use a cheaper brand and get the same results as department brands, but sad to say that is not the case. I gave this eyeliner a chance, but sadly it was tossed in the garbage and immediately I went to Nordy&#x27;s to purchase my MAC.</li>
    <li> I have this eyeliner in a couple of colors. It glides on so smooth. It&#x27;s rich &amp; creamy, I used other expensive brands &amp; this is so much easier to apply. There is a small downfall-It does leave a line on your upper eyelid crease. I use some eye shadow instead of just eyeliner &amp; that seems to fix that problem. I would recommend this product. Just make sure to wipe off the brush when done, it tends to get stiff.</li>
    <li> This gel goes on easy enough, but.......  I applied some this morning about 10 a.m. and by 5 p.m. the gel had redistributed the eyeliner to the top of my lids and lower lids as well.  Glad I tried it at home before going out of the house with it.  Looked like a bloody racoon or my first day putting on makeup.....would never purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Easy to brush on and its so less messy, love it!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is very wet and smudgy. It takes forever to dry and I had to set with a black eyeshadow and it still smudged a great deal, and it continued smudging right through the day. Also a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too much of it. The color is a very black black so that&#x27;s a good thing. I would not repurchase this.</li>
    <li> It works, but it is not long lasting. By the end of the work day, I look like I have raccoon eyes. The color is correct, but the texture of the product is a little greasy, and smears so easily. If you use it to line the bottom, be aware if any of the liner gets on your lashes, you will have lash marks on your face all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this liner last year and thought I would try it. It went on good, but faded during the day and disappeared.Do NOT waste money on this overpriced product.</li>
    <li> It smears and doesn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
    <li> This is an okay eyeliner. It&#x27;s very creamy and the brush that comes with it is awesome. I&#x27;ve used it to line my top and bottom lids. It doesn&#x27;t work so well on the bottom (runs after an hour or so) but on the top it looks good and lasts a long time. You also don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, a small dab is enough to line your whole lash line, so one pot will last you ages. Be careful about how much you use as it can get heavy and smear if you use to much. Overall I was pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner starts off pretty well when your first get it.It glides on very well. But the more you use it is when it starts to clump up. Also, the more you use the brush, the harder it gets to apply so you might as well just use a different brush to begin with or buy a separate one. Lastly this eyeliner smears very easily.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner ive ever used!</li>
    <li> The liner goes on like a dream and a little goes a long way. My issues is it smudges and smears within application! Not even smudge as in, mild normal corner of the eye. This stuff creates a mirror image arc on my lids from where the liner touches my brow when my eyes are open. It&#x27;s really too bad because it goes on amazingly but comes off and gets all over the place. Not only that but a $1 liner pencil can do a better job!!!   MONEY BACK PLEASE!!!</li>
    <li> This seems like a great deal but it wasn&#x27;t for me, I need to use waterproof because in Arizona I literally sweat off my makeup and I had never tried gel eyeliner before so I decided to try this. It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t long lasting and it smudges. It also isn&#x27;t as dark black as I hoping for the color was sort of dull.</li>
    <li> I have asymmetrical eyes.  My right eye has a slight thicker double-lid than my left eye.  So, I always find it so hard to use eyeliner pencils to make &#x27;em look the same.  But with this product, it takes whole a lot of stress off from my shoulders by providing smooth and precise application.  The brush is much easier to handle on my eyes, and it really last long.  However, when you first apply it on your eyes, it&#x27;s crucial that you dry them off, or else, that gel will get all over the place.  Try to dip just the tip of your brush into the gel so that you can get the minimum amount of gel on it.  Over dipping will make it harder for you to not get smudged.</li>
    <li> I like the amount you get! It will last for a long time! But the thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it takes a long time to dry so when I blink it smudges on my eye lid:/ it annoys me! But other than that it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
    <li> This liner does smudge quite a bit, but I have figured out that if you wet the brush and apply it sparsely as you would with watercolor, it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all and you still get a rich color.</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly and easily. But it smudges pretty easily, especially since I have to moisturize my face.</li>
    <li> its very very runny and spreads very easily</li>
    <li> Not as waterproof as it should be.. Smears easy</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t even known what gel eyeliner was until I saw it on here. I love it! It stayed on well, and its easy to apply!</li>
    <li> This product was decent. It goes on really creamy, but it&#x27;s also kind of heavy. I was excited to have an eyeliner that would stay on my waterline, but it fell down in seconds. It will stay for about 4 hours, but then start to run or smear. Other than that, it&#x27;s actually a pretty good eyeliner, especially for a gel. The brush that comes with it is very good about only using a little bit of the gel to go a long way, so it&#x27;ll last practically forever. I would suggest only using this on the top lashline, though, so it won&#x27;t run and make you look like a raccoon.</li>
    <li> brush is not of a v great quality, i use a previous eyeliner brush. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel eyeliner that I have tried.  It is easily applied to the brush and eye.  It goes on dark, however I usually do two coats to make it crisp.  It last all day and looks wonderful.  The only problem is that it tends to smudge if rubbed.  If you do not rub you will have no problems at all.</li>
    <li> Best eye liner ever, it was very smooth and easy to put on. My aunt is a makeup artist and she loved it better then MAC, she even stole it from me. Haha I highly recommned this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> At first I was a little scared because I never tried a gel eyeliner before,im more of a liquid eyeliner girl but I wanted to see how good gel formula was. So I bought the shade (Black Asphalt) and I love it. I also don&#x27;t use it as a liner for my lids but I also use it for my brows as well. It does not look funny what so ever when I put it on,and it also stays put when I wear it whether it&#x27;s 4 hours or even 9 hours maybe even longer. It also does not fade or crease either. I love the brush as well it makes sharp lines not smudgy uneven lines. And it&#x27;s very soft but sturdy enough to make a straight or curvy line(your in control of the brush). I will be buying this from now on. Thanks Starry!!!</li>
    <li> Having not heard much of this brand (very few blog reviews exist), I was worried that the product would not deliver the pigmentation I was looking for. I was in search of a highly pigmented gel liner and did not want to spend the cash on MAC Chromaline or Inglot AMC Gel Liner right away. I love this item and will definitely purchase additional colors! Added bonus: The brush it comes with is nice and small and does a decent job!</li>
    <li> Stays on all day and smudges easily for that smoky eye look. Doesn&#x27;t fall and has a dark black color. I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding eyeliner dark enough for me, and I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> nice, just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Long lasting as long as you set it with black eye shadow. Love it!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t really looking for a expensive famous eye liner , just a high quality black eyeliner tbh this was it, I actually think the brush is good too 😊</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner it&#x27;s one of my favorites right now, i would have purchased more but i did end up seeing them at Ross and started buying them there!</li>
    <li> I love the brush that came with it but the gel is a little smuggy but it was worth it is you put powder ove it</li>
    <li> The packaging was smashed, but I love the eyeliner. If I&#x27;m running late I still use my crayon based eyeliner (only because I&#x27;m still faster at applying that)  BUT this eyeliner is great. It works well with a natural eyeshadow and a nice wing or dark smokey eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t smear, but it washes of nicely.&lt;br /&gt;-The brush handle is short so you can get close to a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s possible to create thin lines &amp;  wings with this brush... But if you&#x27;re used to a crayon/pencil based eyeliner it does takes some practice to do it in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Besides the smashed  packaging (that ended up in the trash anyway)  there aren&#x27;t any.</li>
    <li> One star is added extra since it&#x27;s so richly pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;It smudges with contact with water, like tears or sweat or fine morning dew in the air.  It smudges with contact with oil, like the kind your eyes naturally produce or from irritated eyes.  It smudges when rubbed or when left to its own devices.  It smudges and smears on the top lid, lower lid, lashline, tightline.&lt;br /&gt;It does work pretty well as an eyeshadow base, but it needs to be primed and then set with eyeshadow.  I think eyeliner from the modern era should be able to work without nursing it all day.&lt;br /&gt;The brush included is actually very nice quality, so that&#x27;s another star.&lt;br /&gt;The shade is very black and rich but has a translucency that makes it easy to sheer out.  I&#x27;ll probably never use this for my eyes unless I need monster makeup.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Its will run, only after 30 mins of wearing.</li>
