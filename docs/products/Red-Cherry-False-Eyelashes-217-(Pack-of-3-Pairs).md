      <li>Easiest and most beautiful lashes I have ever used ♥ Completly impressed with the quality of this product.</li>
      <li>My favorite lashes ever.</li>
      <li>red cherry lashes are the best.</li>
      <li>I was hoping the length would make them stand out more, it didn&#x27;t, they are just too wispy to bulk up the volume the way I wanted.</li>
      <li>After trying out all different types of lashes, I like these the best.  </li>
      <li>I bought the multi pack first and decided this pair was a good size for a night out, with out being too over the top.</li>
      <li>Very full look lashes.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply too.</li>
      <li>Beautiful high quality, and look very natural</li>
      <li>Application is pretty easy, but they don&#x27;t come with glue.</li>
      <li>and i had to trim the hairs a bit but other than that they are amazing :]</li>
      <li>Very durable!</li>
      <li>They look so natural and feel so light and airy on.</li>
      <li>But they are the long, wispy type, so make sure that&#x27;s the look you want before ordering them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not stick to your skin..not to much glue</li>
      <li>and I just felt like these gave me more length but got a little lost amongst my lashes.</li>
      <li>I had to trim them and they looked a little better</li>
      <li>yay i finally got them and its my first time trying these</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a bit long, so you might have to trim the inside or outside corners to get them to fit.</li>
      <li>For a woman starting to wear fake lashes, these are of good quality &amp; real looking!</li>
      <li>Nothing natural looking about these lashes.  </li>
      <li>i go for natural soft look.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of natural lashes</li>
      <li>They are thin and whispy and look lovely in the package but the length of them just makes them look totally unnatural.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re long but still look natural.  </li>
      <li>These are my personal favorites (so far) from Red Cherry, they look similar to 747m but just a tad shorter and thinner.</li>
      <li>They are so long and luxurious, but can look so natural at the same time.</li>

    <li> These are my personal favorites (so far) from Red Cherry, they look similar to 747m but just a tad shorter and thinner. They&#x27;re a bit long, so you might have to trim the inside or outside corners to get them to fit. Application is pretty easy, but they don&#x27;t come with glue. I used Ardell&#x27;s Waterproof Lash Grip adhesive (it came with my 110&#x27;s), and they stayed on all night and were still there the next morning.</li>
    <li> yay i finally got them and its my first time trying these and i like em the only thing i do have to say is that they are a bit long in length and i had to trim the hairs a bit but other than that they are amazing :] will re purchase</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; like this product and I knew what I was getting when I bought them based on the other reviews. But they are the long, wispy type, so make sure that&#x27;s the look you want before ordering them. I have a lot of natural lashes and I just felt like these gave me more length but got a little lost amongst my lashes. I was hoping the length would make them stand out more, it didn&#x27;t, they are just too wispy to bulk up the volume the way I wanted. My fault for thinking they would, but we warned.</li>
    <li> For a woman starting to wear fake lashes, these are of good quality &amp; real looking!</li>
    <li> These lashes are very beautiful and flirty!</li>
    <li> While i do like these lashes they are very very long. They are thin and whispy and look lovely in the package but the length of them just makes them look totally unnatural. Still If you are going for that long lash doe eyed look you may want to give them a try.</li>

    <li> my eyes are small and slanted so these lashes were too big for my eyes. they went up to my eyebrows. i dont look for the dramatic look. i go for natural soft look.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product! Can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the different styles. I bought the multi pack first and decided this pair was a good size for a night out, with out being too over the top.</li>
