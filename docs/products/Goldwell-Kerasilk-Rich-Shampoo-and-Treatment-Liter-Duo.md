    <li> I only use Goldwell. I use this formula or the extra rich. My hair is heavily processed and looks great thanks to these product. They also have a color line but I tried those and while they smelled wonderful it washed my color out faster than this formula.</li>
    <li> Takes about a week to feel and see a difference in my hair but it is worth the wait. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I live in Florida so I have a frizz problem. This knocks out 90% of it. Will continue to buy!</li>
