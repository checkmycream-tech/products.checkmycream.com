    <li> I used to love this perfume, and wore it all the time a few years ago. I&#x27;m not sure why, but it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same to me anymore. I don&#x27;t think it works with my body chemistry. Unfortunately it is not returnable.</li>

    <li> Bought as a gift and was well received.  Good value for the price. Not much more to say than that.</li>

    <li> Hi boughtthis as a gift , and now I have love for life</li>
    <li> Aromas are very personal; for us, this one is tops.  It has been around a while but with us will never go out of choice</li>
    <li> My wife had this a couple years ago and absolutely loved it. I had ordered this one just a few days before Christmas. She enjoys the fragrance a lot and loves to wear it. Great product at a reasonable affordable price and loved by everyone around her.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness that I can buy my favorite scent at a reasonable cost. I&#x27;ve it. It is my signature.My husband bought.it for me for Mother&#x27;s day hooray</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the fragrance, and it&#x27;s my favorite perfume.</li>

    <li> I purchased as a gift for my wife.  She loves it and so do I.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff. She&#x27;s worn YSL Opium cologne and parfum for many many years and really likes it. And I like the way it smells, it&#x27;s her. So I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Great parfume...I thought it was bigger bottle.  Will look at other size but that was an oversight on my part</li>
    <li> This has been my &#x27;travel fragrance&#x27; for many years, and I have always gotten complements on it.  I have decided I can use it while I am at home as well as on the road.</li>
    <li> Omgggggg&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the worst perfume ever. I tried before going to the movies w my husband, after an hour I couldn&#x27;t take anymore, I had to go back home  nauseating like crazy!!! I&#x27;m not a complainer. . If I do complain,  I have a good reason for. I had to bath myself.... never again. Smells like an old old old women&#x27;s closet full of powder! No!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! Received a lot sooner then was stated. Would purchase again :-D</li>
    <li> The ordering process was easy, delivery was prompt. It was exactly what I wanted. My Mother was thrilled. Thanks Guys! It is nice to have access to consistent quality.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume - what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> I have always been hesitant to spend a lot of money on a fragrance but this was one that I remember smelling on a stranger I encountered years ago and could not help but ask what fragrance she was wearing.  I finally splurged and bought this item for myself because after looking in several stores and online, this seemed to be the best deal.  Opium has a spicy, floral fragrance that I believe goes well with a formal evening out on the town.</li>
    <li> Love opium! No problems</li>
    <li> Good quality. Fast ship.</li>
