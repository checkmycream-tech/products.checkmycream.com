      <li>really even when some nozzle gets defective...</li>
      <li>However it&#x27;s will be fast faded, you will need to apply it gradually throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I got exactly what I expected from the add in your store.</li>
