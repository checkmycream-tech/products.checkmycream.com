### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great for work!</li>
      <li>Great prices.</li>
      <li>Might buy more to use in my industrial.</li>
      <li>Accurate description.</li>
      <li>Bought it won&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>When I got it it wouldn&#x27;t fit into my 18 gauge piercing.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit in my nose</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s comfortable and discreet for my office job on a phone all day.</li>
      <li>18G. Looks a bit bigger, and isn&#x27;t as good quality as the picture.</li>
      <li>I got it very quickly and it was exactly as described</li>
      <li>At first I liked that the top of the ring was flat</li>
      <li>Not fun or attractive.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone especially when they have better ones that are cheaper.</li>
      <li>To long and didn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Fast transaction.</li>
      <li>They are very willing to work with you and fix any problems with extra diligence!</li>
      <li>leaving a very noticeable dimple on the outside of my nose, completely defeating the purpose of having a &#x27;clear&#x27; retainer.</li>
      <li>AND the straight end  is tooooooooo short...</li>
      <li>Take my word for it: DO NOT waste your money on this piece of s</li>
      <li>gage was WAY too big for a normal nose piercing.</li>
      <li>so it would camouflage better, however, because it was so small and flat</li>
      <li>It feels very secure unlike other retainers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>The retainer itself is very difficult to get into the nose, but once it&#x27;s in, I loved it.</li>
      <li>after over an hour of cussing and lucky maneuvering with a pair of needle-nosed pliers (don&#x27;t ask), I was finally able to get the stupid thing in my nose....</li>

<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s really</li>
<li> Basically just wasted money and had to repierce due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t have a clear retainer for a professional event</li>
<li> Once I put a little makeup on my face after I&#x27;d already put the retainer in, it looked a little like a blackhead and was only really noticeable when my eyes went looking for it.</li>
<li> The ball is too small and nearly worked its way through my piercing.</li>
<li> Very uncomfortable if a new piercing as it seems to stretch the hole too much on the outside.</li>
<li> (opposed to a bigger round ball)</li>
<li> I ignored all the other reviews and went ahead with buying the product but even at 1.99 I regret this purchase.</li>
<li> Not worth the money</li>
<li> I spend at least 20 mins trying to get this through my piercing with no luck, and I regularly wear 18g rings in my nose.</li>
<li> It is noticeable as stated in other reviews, but nose retainers are almost always a little noticeable.</li>
<li> my nose was sore for a few days.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> This piercing is a waste of money!</li>
<li> This sucks, took forever to get in I</li>
<li> ended up cutting the back to make it easier to get in.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too long, and awkward.</li>
<li> It is very hard to put in.</li>
<li> Poor product.</li>
<li> Horrible, difficult to put in because it wasn&#x27;t the right size.</li>
<li> it was extremely difficult and the length was not correct.</li>
<li> Sadly the bioflex was not optimal for insertion into my piercing</li>
<li> Made it very difficult to get into my nose and by the time I did</li>
<li> This product is way too flexible, making it VERY difficult to put on...</li>
<li> its so flexible and i can&#x27;t put it and scrapes me when i try to  wear really bad product</li>
<li> It was painful and caused an infection.</li>
<li> Ugh!  Very unhappy with this product.</li>

<ol>
    <li> The ball at the end is the slightly bigger as the shift therefore allowing the ring to go all the way through the hole. Very uncomfortable if a new piercing as it seems to stretch the hole too much on the outside.</li>
    <li> I got it very quickly and it was exactly as described</li>
    <li> I am using this as a tragus retainer. It was a pain to put in but it&#x27;s comfortable and discreet for my office job on a phone all day. Might buy more to use in my industrial.</li>
    <li> To long and didn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
    <li> The retainer itself is very difficult to get into the nose, but once it&#x27;s in, I loved it. It feels very secure unlike other retainers I&#x27;ve used in the past. It is noticeable as stated in other reviews, but nose retainers are almost always a little noticeable. However, I thought it served its purpose well, and nobody seemed to be staring at it. Once I put a little makeup on my face after I&#x27;d already put the retainer in, it looked a little like a blackhead and was only really noticeable when my eyes went looking for it. I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> its so flexible and i can&#x27;t put it and scrapes me when i try to  wear really bad product</li>
    <li> This is definitely not properly sized. I ignored all the other reviews and went ahead with buying the product but even at 1.99 I regret this purchase. I spend at least 20 mins trying to get this through my piercing with no luck, and I regularly wear 18g rings in my nose.</li>
    <li> Great for work! I just cut the tip off to make it an L shape instead of a the screw because that&#x27;s my preference.</li>
    <li> gage was WAY too big for a normal nose piercing.</li>
    <li> This sucks, took forever to get in I ended up cutting the back to make it easier to get in. The ring ended up gauging my piercing because the ball is slightly bigger and it ended up going into my nose. And my skin grew around it. Not worth the money</li>
    <li> They are very willing to work with you and fix any problems with extra diligence!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like product at all. It is very hard to put in. It&#x27;s too long, and awkward. It also messed up my piercing hole. Causing me to take it out.</li>
    <li> Sadly the bioflex was not optimal for insertion into my piercing it was extremely difficult and the length was not correct. The ball is too small and nearly worked its way through my piercing. It was painful and caused an infection. I&#x27;ve had my nose pierced for 3 yrs now and never encountered these problems.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be flexible.  Made it very difficult to get into my nose and by the time I did my nose was sore for a few days.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s really 18G. Looks a bit bigger, and isn&#x27;t as good quality as the picture.</li>
    <li> At first I liked that the top of the ring was flat (opposed to a bigger round ball) so it would camouflage better, however, because it was so small and flat, it started to sink into my nose and make the piercing bigger. My nose began to get irritated and started to get infected because of the pressure of the tip going through the pierced hole. Not fun or attractive.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! This product is way too flexible, making it VERY difficult to put on...after over an hour of cussing and lucky maneuvering with a pair of needle-nosed pliers (don&#x27;t ask), I was finally able to get the stupid thing in my nose....AND the straight end  is tooooooooo short... leaving a very noticeable dimple on the outside of my nose, completely defeating the purpose of having a &#x27;clear&#x27; retainer. Ugh!  Very unhappy with this product.</li>
    <li> When I got it it wouldn&#x27;t fit into my 18 gauge piercing. Basically just wasted money and had to repierce due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t have a clear retainer for a professional event</li>
    <li> Fast transaction. Fast shipping. Great prices. Accurate description.</li>
    <li> This piercing is a waste of money! Take my word for it: DO NOT waste your money on this piece of s*** nose \\&quot;ring\\&quot;. It is waaaay too flexible</li>
    <li> Bought it won&#x27;t fit. it&#x27;s to big</li>
    <li> Horrible, difficult to put in because it wasn&#x27;t the right size. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone especially when they have better ones that are cheaper. Poor product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit in my nose</li>
