      <li>For those with sensitive scalps this is a very good product.  </li>
      <li>I will use this product for many years to come.</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>Most fragrances in hair products give me a migraine.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I switched to Honeybee gardens and it is fantastic!</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>

      <li>If I wanted to smell nice, I might choose a lightly scented lotion or a dab of quality perfume.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most hair products that contain many chemicals.  </li>
      <li>and I am so glad that I did.</li>
      <li>so I love it for that.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to iodobutylpropanol carbamate, a preservative used in many lotions and sprays.</li>
      <li>I tried this hairspray because I am allergic to all others, and I love it.</li>
      <li>Wal-Mart should carry, lots of folks need an healthy alternative to the scented garbage that on the shelves.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It would be soooo nice if they made this in an aerosol version to create a finer, wider spray resulting in a light coat of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does a very good job job without irritating my sensitive skin at all.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I have sensitive skin and have never had a problem with this hairspray.  No scent.  It holds amazingly well.  And, it is a good bargain.  Not pricey at all.  Been using it for several years now and would recommend to anyone with or without sensitive skin and sensitivity to scents.</li>
    <li> The spray comes out unevenly.</li>
    <li> I;s OK in an emergency.</li>
    <li> This hairspray held fine and did not cause my skin to itch.  At first I was having trouble using the pump spray.  Now I rinse the sprayer tip after, and sometimes during use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any particular sensitivity to scents or dyes, but I still love that this product is not scented!  If I wanted to smell nice, I might choose a lightly scented lotion or a dab of quality perfume.  I would certainly not want to smell like scented hairspray!  My only complaint about this particular product is that the \\&quot;firm hold\\&quot; actually means \\&quot;death grip,\\&quot; and it leaves my hair incredibly stiff.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that it can flake off or leave a thin gray coating on my hair, which can be avoided if you use it sparingly.  If you want really, really stiff hair, then this is the product for you.  I recently ordered the \\&quot;soft hold\\&quot; version so I&#x27;m hoping that will work better for me.</li>
    <li> Great product no smell will be buying more soon !!!</li>
    <li> Best fragrance-free hairspray I&#x27;ve used. My hair is thick and heavy. The firm hold is perfect. Not stiff, but holds well.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t many fragrance-free hairspray options out there, but if there were I probably would be using another one. To its credit there is no smell, which is good because sometimes fragrance-free products can smell kind of bad. My main complaint about this hairspray is that it makes you hair wetter than you would like, especially after styling. The hold is okay, but I&#x27;ve had better. Unfortunately the better ones make my skin itch so it looks like I will be sticking with this one.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  Was apprehensive due to product a necessity for my body but soon learned its holding power exceeded previous item used.  Beauty shop is very impressed with Free &amp; Clear products....</li>
    <li> Love every product this company makes!&lt;br /&gt; Their quality cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> I love their products.  My eczema is disappearing.  Wish I knew about this earlier.</li>
    <li> This is the best fragrance-free hairspray I have ever found.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything claimed. It&#x27;s odorless and a very good hairspray, too. I highly recommend it. This is not my first use of it an it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
    <li> I was afraid it wasn&#x27;t going to be as good as what I had been using when in fact it is better.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to find a firm hold hair spray that doesn&#x27;t cause my scalp to break out.  I spray this on wet hair at the roots as a setting spray, and again at the roots when dry.  It has extended the life of my perm by several months.  I have also ordered the Free &amp; Clear gentler hold spray for all over finishing - my hair is fine and this spray would be too strong for that.</li>
    <li> Glad to finally find a chemical free hair spray that actually holds.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product here all the time, and I&#x27;ve had great service from the various vendors.  Be sure, however, to check the shipping price before placing a final order.  The current vendor (AmericaRx) charges half as much for shipping as for the product itself.  I was able to get the same product through an allergy site for slightly less per bottle, and the shipping was less than half as much per bottle.  I ended up buying FOUR bottles and having them shipped for only sixty cents more (total!) than the price of TWO bottles plus shipping on this site.  \\&quot;Standard\\&quot; shipping on the other site is FedEx Ground, so shipping is fast, and you save $2.25 per bottle on shipping.</li>
    <li> If you are the least bit sensitive to hair sprays, you have to buy this product.  It comes in both firm and soft hold</li>
    <li> Thought I would sacrifice when I had to move to fragrance free products only. Boy, was I wrong. I love this hairspray! Works great on my fine, no-body hair!</li>
    <li> This hairspray holds my hair all day without making it feel sticky. I am also able to easily run a comb or brush through my hair at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Anyone who is allergic to commercial hairsprays has been pretty much out of luck in the hairspray department. The one brand that had a \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; version discontinued it, and many of us who have tried every other possibility in the beauty departments of drug and department stores have been disappointed as we deal with itchy eyes and rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the answer to the problem, and it&#x27;s so good you&#x27;d use it even if you weren&#x27;t allergic to other brands!  Though it does not advertise itself as \\&quot;hypoallergenic,\\&quot; it does emphasize that it has been \\&quot;created for persons who wish to avoid common chemical irritants found in ordinary hair sprays.,\\&quot; and it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a pump spray with a good firm hold, though not stiff and gluey. It does not dull hair, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to accumulate the way commercial aerosol brands do. The price, while higher than the aerosol sprays in the supermarket, is comparable to the \\&quot;designer\\&quot; brand labels in salons, and one bottle lasts me about two months.  The itchy, red eyes are gone, and I am recommending this to my friends--even those who don&#x27;t \\&quot;need\\&quot; it the way I do.  Two of them have ordered it as a result, and they like it as much as I do.  Cannot recommend this product more highly!  Mary Whipple</li>
    <li> This is one of the few hair products I can use without an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I had been doing some research on, [...], for a chemical free, non toxic hairspray and found Free and Clear, I ordered two bottles after reading the reviews posted here and online. It is wonderful stuff, holds your hair, has no weird odor, not sticky and doesn&#x27;t clog!</li>
    <li> Love this product because it is free of chemicals. I have 9 chemical allergies and this works for me.  Anyone that has chemical allergies should really try this product.  Also the hold is not to stiff so this is a plus.</li>
    <li> Since I have fine, limp hair, I need a very firm hairspray without silicone to get lift at the root. Has anyone wondered why their hair is flatter at the root than it used to be a decade ago? That&#x27;s because everything didn&#x27;t have silicone in it back then. This hairspray does have silicone (PEG-12 dimethicone) which makes my hair flat and stuck to my head. I hate that look! There are only a few hairsprays without silicones of any kind, but they are all scented. If anyone knows of a mega firm scent-free hairspray with no silicones, please let me know.</li>
    <li> My dermatolgist recommended it and I love it. It holds well and can be combed through for a softer look.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally find some hairspray that I can use!!  Thank you for supplying people with a great fragrance free line of products</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heavy on my fine hair</li>
    <li> So hard to find, no irritating scents, I am chemically sensitive and this product is a godsend.</li>
    <li> I tried this product b/c I have very sensitive skin, and most hairsprays make my face breakout.  My face continued to breakout while using the Free and Clear hairspray, plus it did not hold my hair, and I did not like the way it made my hair feel.</li>
    <li> This hairspray works well. It holds my hair in place and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  It allows movement of my hair as it does not have a stiff hold.  I like the absence of any odor and stickiness like there is with most hairsprays.</li>
    <li> I could not even begin to get this bottle to work . The &amp;#34;Odor Free&amp;#34; was a great thing for me ,but I can&#x27;t get it to work ,no way!</li>
    <li> I really like this hairspray-it keeps my hair in place and I&#x27;ve had no skin or scalp reactions.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for anyone with allergies to fragrances</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this hairspray. I have allergies and asthma, and am very sensitive to fragrance. I cannot wear fragrance or even use fragranced body lotions, hairsprays, gels, etc. This hairspray has absolutely no fragrance, and works well. I am very happy to have found this on Amazon.com. Next I will try this brand of hair styling gel.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and I am very pleased. I have allergies and asthma and I am very sensitive to scent. This product has no heavy scents or perfumes so I can tolerate it, and still have good looking hair.I would highly recommend this product if you can&#x27;t tolerate harsh scents. I hope they continue to make this product because I will continue to buy it forever!</li>
    <li> I have fine, shoulder-length hair.  I primarily use hair spray around the roots to add body and to hold the baby hairs in place.  I developed a mild reaction to the current hair products I use (that works) and tried Free &amp; Clear Firm Hold Hair Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not happy with the spray.  I&#x27;m not sure what it really does because it feels like my hair is still doing it&#x27;s own thing, regardless how much spray I use.  I may as well use NO HAIR SPRAY because it seems to wear off a few minutes after application.  This is after a using it for a few days: my hair is unruly.  I&#x27;m going back to the stuff I&#x27;m allergic to (it worked all this time without issue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * No itchy dandruff due to allergic reaction to hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * Hold is not firm nor does it give my hair body.  Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s Spray and Play Harder holds better.  Kept my hair in place without looking it like a helmet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * Does not keep baby hairs in place.  John Frieda&#x27;s Fly Away Tamer does the best job on this one.</li>
    <li> I have fine hard to hold hair.  I also have acne prone skin.  I was looking for something that would hold my hair yet not make my face break out.  I read the reviews on this one and tried it.  It holds my hair pretty good.  Not as good and the chemical junk, but so far this is the best thing I have found.</li>
    <li> Only brand so far that I can use.  Have gone without hairspray for years before this.  I also have used the light hold.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily.  It meets my needs and my dermatologist approves.</li>
    <li> Only hairspray I use. It holds perfectly. I like the shampoo too  I wish it came in a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s unscented. My husband hates the smell of any hairspray. He gets deathly ill. When I started using this spray I love that it&#x27;s unscented. The spray gets too wet on the hair and then it flakes! That&#x27;s why I gave it a 3 stars.</li>
    <li> For starters, I have allergic reactions to most products that contain the vague term \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot; With this in mind, I&#x27;ve had a problem finding a hair spray that holds well without making my hair brittle and subject to breaking and splitting ends, but Free &amp; Clear Firm Hold Hair Spray does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; hair spray I have found, that has a good amount of hold (I have very straight, fine hair) but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair overly sticky, and brittle.  I can comb my hair during the course of the day and it will still hold my style.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this hairspray in the morning on my way out the door to work and still had my hairstyle holding up into the evening when I&#x27;ve gone out to dinner.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this hairspray for anyone allergy prone, but still looking for a good amount of hold!</li>
    <li> This product is not fragrance-free.  It has an odor to it that does not go away.  For those who are sensitive to all the petrochemical fragrances in hair products, this is not a good choice.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin this shampoo works well.</li>
    <li> works great, no fragrance, non-irritating.  I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
    <li> Good, but makes my hair oily. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp or flake off.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff because it holds my short hair in place. I have very straight, fine hair and use a curling iron to get it looking decent. This spray holds in place so it doesn&#x27;t go straight and flat.</li>
    <li> This product does wonders for my itchy scalp. I just wish it was a little bit stronger in the hold department. It gets pretty windy here in Vegas.</li>
    <li> I tried this hairspray because I am allergic to all others, and I love it. It has a firm enough (but not helmetlike) hold, is non-sticky, is completely fragrance-free and best of all, I am not allergic (first hairspray ever where that&#x27;s the case!)</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, I mean sensitive. I have tried every hairspray know to mankind and still had irritation. This product is wonderful, no more irritated scalp!!!!!!!!!!. It also holds my hair in place all day. GREAT product.</li>
    <li> I have had many salon hairsprays in the past. Since I developed allergies and dermatitis at this late date in my life, I sure didn&#x27;t know what to purchase. My dermatologist recommended Free &amp; Clear hair products, as well as Vanicream creams and lotions and skin soap.  I have not been disappointed yet!  I use soap and moisturizing cream from Vanicreqm, and shampoo, conditioner, styling gel, hairspray from Free &amp; Clear. SAME OR BETTER than big name salon products, but no scent. Good for us allergy-ridden folk. I highly recommend ANY Free &amp; Clear products. Well done.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! I finally found a hairspray I can use without having allergic reations. I have very chemically sensitive skin so most hairsprays cause me severe allergic reactions but I work in a field where I am required to keep my hair pulled back and neat so this product is a god send. I can keep my hair back and neat for work without having to worry about having reactions and taking allergy meds all the time to counteract them.</li>
    <li> I had tried for months to figure out what was at the bottom of my allergy -- shampoo, conditioner, gel -- when finally I narrowed it down to hairspray -- ALL hairsprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but with a small amount of research on line I located Free&amp; Clear hairspray. Love it! no more allergy symptoms. and it&#x27;s just the right touch of hold -- natural yet firm.</li>
    <li> do not like the pump hairsprays</li>
    <li> the hairspray does what I&#x27;d hoped-in that It has no alcohol odor as some supposedly &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;hairsprays do. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars as it does make my hair very STIFF ,altho.on the plus side,no winds,however strong,can mess up my hair.! I would most likely buy this again as it&#x27;s difficult to find unscented products that are REALLY unscented.</li>
    <li> I have had to search to find this product.  For anyone who has sensitivities to scents or chemicals, but want a bit of hold, this is a great product. It does not have any scent, and it works.</li>
    <li> It does work and it really is hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those of us that have allergies or anyone else...great hold and fragrance free.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This hairspray works great. I have a lot of allergies and can&#x27;t use products that have a lot of ingredients or scents.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It gives great hold like my old Sebastian spray that was discontinued, but doesn&#x27;t leave a glue like shellac on the floor that I used to slip on in the bathroom after spraying everyday with the Sebastian. I like that it&#x27;s unscented too.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband with skin allergies.  It works just as well as any other hair spray without the added scents and chemicals that he doesn&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> I like that it is unscented.  I cannot find another truly unscented hairspray yet.  However, it is a pump spray and it puts a lot of product one the one spot you are spraying, resulting in a sticky stiff spot in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be soooo nice if they made this in an aerosol version to create a finer, wider spray resulting in a light coat of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use this item any more...</li>
    <li> I am allergic to iodobutylpropanol carbamate, a preservative used in many lotions and sprays. The top of my scalp and ears usually  becomes itchy when I use hairspray. The Free &amp; Clear Hairspray doesn&#x27;t cause any problem, and has no scent. It holds my hairstyle well, too. A little goes a long way, so the price seems reasonable even though it is not a large bottle.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thick hair that holds no style.  I have made peace with my hair.  That said, occasionally I would like my hair to stay put.  I can find NOTHING in local stores that does not send me into an instant migraine.  This is finally what I need.  I HIGHLY recommend the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best fragrance-free hairspray I&#x27;ve found so far.  I have thick hair and get some hold from this product.  The 3 stars are for hold.  For fragrance-free it&#x27;s 5 stars, which is why I buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find one that my husband can tolerate with his chemical sensitivities....I used it today and he couldn&#x27;t smell a thing plus it had great holding power....win, win situation!!!!  So glad to have finally found one I can use.</li>
    <li> i am allergic to a lot of chemicals. this is perfect for me and really holds the hair in place. would recommend.</li>
    <li> I recently had a flare-up with red flaky skin around my eyes. I thought it might be from working out--sweat mingling with the styling products in my hair and irritating my skin. I only use premium hair products(Fekkai, Phyto, Davines, Philip B, etc) so I was not too happy that I had to give them up, but I was desperate. Then I did some research on Amazon and found Free and Clear. Well, it didn&#x27;t help my skin condition, but I was pretty impressed with the products (styling gel and hair spray). The styling gel isn&#x27;t sticky and gives my hair volume and shine. The hairspray holds nicely, but isn&#x27;t stiff. I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old products after I use these up, but I wanted to write this review because Free and Clear products really do a great job on your hair. So if you need hair products without certain chemicals don&#x27;t be afraid to try Free and Clear--you don&#x27;t have to give up nice hair for hypoallergenic products--and it might just work for you!!</li>
    <li> It had firm hold, but was not stiff.  Good combination.</li>
    <li> Hairspray made my hair dry &amp; hard.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> Maybe I received a defective sprayer. Here is what happens. I have to push really hard. Big drops come out and make my hair wet. I have to wait for it to dry. When it finally dries, the treated part of my hair is stiff and doesn&#x27;t feel pleasant to touch. It holds OK, but I&#x27;d much rather buy a regular spray that mists the hair and leaves it soft.</li>
    <li> Way to watery to be effective as a hair spray</li>
    <li> Very sticky.... and as of right now, I think I am breaking out from it.  Why, if it&#x27;s free and clear?  It&#x27;s supposed to be good for dermatologic purposes... so feeling mixed about it right now.</li>
    <li> No smell does not work well</li>
    <li> The item arrived quickly.  The only problem I have is that it doesn&#x27;t spray very well.  I need to run water over the top and really shake it every time I use it.  Otherwise it is great to have a hairspray on the market that is paraben and fragrance free.  The hold doesn&#x27;t last very long - not even an hour.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It holds my hair very well and I am not allergic to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Free &amp; Clear line.  They all work well and its use helps keep eczema at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Free &amp; Clear</li>
    <li> Great for allergy sufferers! We need dye free shampoo.  Also like that it doesn&#x27;t have many harmful ingredients. Very gentle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with fine hair so I&#x27;m forced to spray it in place with something.  Unfortunately I also have sensitive skin and I have a bad reaction to every hair spray available locally and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  By the end of the day my head actually hurts to touch my hair and when I get home from work I have to wash it out.  Free &amp; Clear has no annoying fragrance, dries almost instantly and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.  Finally something I can use!</li>
    <li> Alergic to dyes and perfume so this works well for me</li>
    <li> I like the product inside the bottle, and a couple of years ago gave it a 5 star rating.  However, this is the second bottle I&#x27;ve received where the spray pump does not work.  The first time I thought it was a fluke, but now I think it is a common flaw.  A shame, since I can&#x27;t find a non-scented hair spray within a 60 mile radius of where I live.  The first time I poured the contents into an earlier bottle I purchased, but now even that one doesn&#x27;t work.  Amazon says I can&#x27;t return it.  I will update my review when I hear back from them as to the resolution of my complaint.</li>
    <li> If you are truly sensitive to scents do not buy this as it has a noticeable scents and is not returnable.  Plus it is quite expensive for hair spray.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray that I have found that I am not allergic to.  It took me a lot of years to find this and I am so glad that I did.</li>
    <li> Product would not spray out of the nozzle. So, got a small spray bottle at dollar store and put product in there.  Sprays okay but I had to dilute the product and I did so with Citronella Essential Oil.  Unfortunately, then I smell like a picnic candle.</li>
    <li> This is for my wife.  The problem is with the pump, not the hairspray.  It&#x27;s too hard to pump and it comes out in a drip or stream and is almost impossible to keep from spraying it everywhere except on her hair.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Great for sensitive scalps.  I have used this for a long time and am glad that I buy it.  Lasts a long time and works wonderful to hold my hair.  I just wish they had a hairspray between firm and soft.  Sometimes the firm is way too firm.  You can&#x27;t combine the two sprays into one bottle.  However, I do sometimes use the firm one day and soft the next.  This company has a great assortment of hair products.  My dermatologist recommended these products and I haven&#x27;t bee sorry.</li>
    <li> But oh how I miss fragrance and the feel of \\&quot;real hairspray\\&quot;.  It does seem to work for me as far as controlling itch and reactions.</li>
    <li> Good product for those of us who are chemically sensitive.</li>
    <li> Its okay, I need a free and clear so I am stuck there, not happy happy but its okay.</li>
    <li> This might be for chemically-sensitive people, but I found this smelled so strong i couldn&#x27;t use it. If you&#x27;re looking for something w/light or no scent, this isn&#x27;t it</li>
    <li> I was having skin issues (pimpley rashes) with any and every hair product before I found this hairspray. It works very well for those with skin sensitivities. I will use this product for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would not give me a headache like all the other hairsprays I&#x27;ve used, but after only a few minutes I had a massive one.&lt;br /&gt;Even though the hold was good, I still will not be able to use it, plus amazon will not let me return it. It&#x27;s not an all natural product so be aware. I&#x27;m still on the lookout for a good hairspray without headaches.</li>
    <li> If you are allergic to alcohol in products do not purchase this product.  It works well but I am highly allergic to it.  I wish that it would have given me the list of ingredients.</li>
    <li> When I could not find the fragrance free hair spray I (and many of my friends) used anymore, I was a little desperate. But, I found this spray on Amazon and tried it and love it. It is not too stiff, but holds reasonably well. Most importantly, it has absolutely NO scent or chemicals that make me sensitive, i.e. sick. I am now glad that the Jhirmack product is not available, as I would not have found this one otherwise. It is making the rounds of my friends who use hairspray and want to be around me, and so far they are all pleased and have or will be ordering.  Of course I wish the price was not so high, and it has gone up since I ordered it. Didn&#x27;t know that adding my friends&#x27; orders would do that!</li>
    <li> Very strong hold.  There is a rubbing alcohol scent when first applied, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> I have purchased more than one can of these hairsprays for my husband to use so far.&lt;br /&gt;Mainly for the reason that it is way less toxic than some store brands.&lt;br /&gt;Not only the bathroom counter is easier to clean now, the air doesn&#x27;t smell like chemical in the house.&lt;br /&gt;It has enough hold even for fine limp hair. (Though he will combined some hair wax)</li>
    <li> Great product for people who suffer from problematic acne.</li>
    <li> I found out I am allergic to fragrance added to just about every product. This is a great hairspray with no fragrance so no more itching.</li>
    <li> My husband is allergic to fragrances. All of them. When I found this spray I was cautiously excited. Having used it now for a few months I can say I am very happy with it. REALLY - no fragrance! And it holds very well too. I have found I use so much less of this spray than the others I used before. It just doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.  Love this!</li>
    <li> Works well and does not smell bad. Doesn&#x27;t have allergens in it so it doesn&#x27;t bother my daughter&#x27;s allergies. Holds hair without being gunky-- once it is dry. We will buy this again.</li>
    <li> arrived in timely fashion and great hold - rare to find fragrance-free hair products so I value the availability.</li>
    <li> A little sticky but doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin so I love it for that. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product because I was looking for a fragrance free hairspray. I keep buying it because it also holds my hair well &amp; the bottle sprays a fine mist without clogging up like most other pump bottles.</li>
    <li> No odor what so ever! Holds well.</li>
    <li> Holds well. My head doesn&#x27;t itch anymore! This brand was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s allergist.</li>
    <li> Glad I could get this hard to find spray that is much healthier than the usual item found on local shelves.</li>
    <li> I have for many years used alcohol free hairspray, however recently the brand I had been using was no longer available.  I read about several products, and decided on Free and Clear.  When I received it I read the ingredients and discovered it contained SD alcohol. I was very disapppointed, but the cost and time to return the item wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair sprays and all of them caused my scalp to break out until now.  This is the best hair spray on the market that I&#x27;ve tried.  Very happy about this too as I have spent a fortune trying different hair sprays over the years.  Free and Clear is the only spray that does not stink and does not cause my scalp to break out.  I have sensitive skin so it is very critical that I have something that works for me.  I highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin allergies like mine!  My only complaint is that it is not sold in stores locally so it has to be ordered online.  Great product!  Try it and see for yourself!  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product without all the perfumes.  The item was well packaged.</li>
    <li> No fragrance. Holds very well. Only downside: I would like a finer mist from the pump.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Need to return.  Product is NOT scent free. Giving &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; star was not an option.</li>
    <li> no fragrance but left hair stiff.</li>
    <li> It works good. There is no sticky residue. No annoying perfumes added to it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the hairspray I was using was causing my allergies to act up&lt;br /&gt;but, I like this hairspray. It&#x27;s too bad I can&#x27;t buy it locally.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive scalp FREE &amp; CLEAR products (recommended by my Dermatologist) is what I use, exclusively.</li>
    <li> This hair spray gives the most natural feel in compare with all the hairsprays I tried. It works, it&#x27;s great. Great for thin hair or sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> The soray is great but I don&#x27;t like the spray mechanism. That should be changed.</li>
    <li> For those with sensitive scalps this is a very good product.  It holds well.  My only complaint is that it comes out not in a mist but in large drops of liquid.  This does not work well on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most hair products that contain many chemicals.  Not as strong as I would like but at least I can use.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy the soft hold hairspray because my husband has very little hair across the top of his head, but plenty around the sides.  I didn&#x27;t think a firm hold hairspray would be necessary, but the firm hold is perfect.  Since he hasn&#x27;t much hair there&#x27;s also not much for the strands to cling together.  This works very well without causing irritation to his scalp.  What&#x27;s especially helpful is that I don&#x27;t necessarily have to use it on his hair everyday.  I shampoo him twice a week, and after I&#x27;ve used the hairspray for a day or two all I have to do is dip a comb in water and comb across the top of his head and the hairspray remaining in his hair kinda re-activates.  It is a little stiff, but not worse than other sprays.  We&#x27;ve noticed no flaking at this point.</li>
    <li> People with dry skin or alergies will love this.  Holds hair and does not dry out skin like those containing alcohol.</li>
    <li> This does not hold my hairstyle at all, unfortunately. Firm hold maybe means something else?? Maybe hold the container with a firm grip? Maybe firmly hold another container of hairspray and use it instead? Hmmmmmm.</li>
    <li> Nice product - not solving my problem though - in fairness though, I bought this on my own research and was hoping that my scalp issues would clear up.  Since it is for sensitive skin i will use up the whole product and may purchase it again if i see any sort of improvement.  (I will copy and paste this review for the shampoo as well.)</li>
    <li> Good.  Much better than any others I have used. Not too bad in the holding dept either.</li>
    <li> Only products that I can use. Expensive but they DO NOT SMELL! I have had to give up/return many other &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; products from big name brands. The fragrance somehow makes it in their products and some even list the fragrance on their ingredients. Don&#x27;t know how they do business!</li>
    <li> This product worked well for the first 6 months or so, I use it occasionally when I see a chemically sensitive client. Then used it and it stuck to my hair like glue. I looked like I had bad dandruff and I had to go to the hairdresser to get it out - she couldn&#x27;t believe it. Would not recommend this product unless they&#x27;ve reformulated it or if you go through it fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> I have many allergies and haven&#x27;t been able to find hair products that I could use.  This is the first hairspray I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause problems for me.  Another reviewer said it was like spraying water on your hair.  While I don&#x27;t agree with that statement totally, it does flatten your hair style out. In my case, that&#x27;s not a bad thing because I straighten my hair.  My only complaint is that it wears off too quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked EVERYWHERE for a hairspray that didn&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell as I have extreme chemical sensitivities. This hairspray holds my hair firm but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell that bothers my sinuses. Thanks Free&amp;Clear!! No more looking around for any other : )</li>
    <li> Most fragrances in hair products give me a migraine.  For some reason aerosol products are even worse.  I was so happy to find a fragrance free, firm hold spritz.  I have used this every day for the past 2 weeks and I am very pleased with it.  When spraying it on my bangs, I use a towel over my face and I can smell just a hint of the chemicals until it dries (in about 1 minute).  After that I don&#x27;t smell it in my hair at all.  I have not experienced any headaches and my nose is not stuffy.  Thank you for offering a fragrance free product.</li>
    <li> I have adult onset eczema so have had to go free and clear with all soaps (shower, shampoo, hand, laundry) and all products that touch my skin. This hairspray, and all of the Free and Clear brand products were recommended by my doctor. These products are a perfect fit for anyone with sensible skin. The hairspray hold very well and causes no eczema breakout.</li>
    <li> PLEASE Do NOT buy this hairspray! I purchased this hairspray and thought it worked really well. Nice firm hold, etc. Then I started noticing what it was actually doing to my hair. After using this spray my hair is COVERED in flyaways and breakage not to mention it started falling out as well! It looks AWFUL!... I tried changing shampoo and conditioner thinking that would help. Finally, my hair stylist read the ingredients on the hairspray bottle and knew this was the culprit! Alcohol! Several people even asked what had happened to my hair. I have always had gorgeous hair...but not now! I stopped using this but the damage has been done and will take a long time to repair! PLEASE if you like your hair and want to keep it, stay AWAY from this hairspray! I switched to Honeybee gardens and it is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Takes a little longer to dry than other hairsprays, holds great, and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch! Will be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> I have long hair that&#x27;s a bit too curly for its own good and have to have it pulled back for professional engagements, so to avoid the frizzies that happen (really bad when it&#x27;s hot and humid outside...), I have to use gel and some hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that my skin is very sensitive, so my scalp get&#x27;s irritated. This eased it quite a bit, paired with the Free &amp; Clear styling gel. The problems aren&#x27;t gone, but a lot of that has to do with stress anyway, but these products made a big impact on it.</li>
    <li> love it.  Iwas afraid that a chemical-free  hair spray might not hold well. I was wrong. this has great hold.</li>
    <li> The hairspray is better than most fragrance free ones on the market; however, it is a little gummy.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t work for me. It was like I was spraying water on my hair with a little bit of stickiness, but not enough to keep my hair in place. As it dried my hair looked flat and like it hadn&#x27;t been washed for a few days. It reminded me of a Jerry Seinfeld episode I saw years ago where the land lord had changed all the shower heads in the apartment to low flow shower heads and Jerry, Cramer and Elaine had really ugly flat hair. I felt self conscious all day because I did not have time to rewash and rework my hair and use something else.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, if you have extra thick hair and you don&#x27;t need a lot of control, this may work for you, but it was a disaster for me!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does not accept returns for this item because they indicate it is a &amp;#34;hazardous substance&amp;#34; so beware before you buy...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser, so I&#x27;m used to using a lot of professional salon products.  This Free &amp; Clear hairspray is good in the respect that it has no scent, but it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair very well at all.  My hair is blond and fine.</li>
    <li> We ordered this for our elderly parent who has become increasing sensitive to almost all chemicals. This hair spray has been a great help for her. It works well with no discernable scent. We highly recommend it for anybody with similar concerns.</li>
    <li> Unhappy with this product.  Bought it because my ears are sensitive to regular hair spray.  May have helped with my ears, but made my hair clumpy, sticky, and straight.</li>
    <li> sprays on like water &amp; not good hold....sorry</li>
    <li> Great hold product, really free and clear. Perfect for those with sensitive skin, and you don&#x27;t need to spray a ton for good hold, but keeps hair soft.</li>
    <li> Trying to hug the planet a little and make some sacrifices, like pump for aerosol.  Holds well, not sticky.  Keep about a foot from head when spraying and it&#x27;s fine, too close and it&#x27;s like a matted wall of hair!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product...pricey to buy online.  Wal-Mart should carry, lots of folks need an healthy alternative to the scented garbage that on the shelves.</li>
    <li> awesome. high quality hair sray without adding a layer of nasty fragrance.  love this fragrance free product.</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to fragrance and it holds my hair well.</li>
    <li> This product does indeed have a firm hold for everyday use, not just windy day.  I would highly recommend for any hair types.</li>
    <li> Hold is ok.....but do not blow on your hair..</li>
    <li> Pros - love the non aersol pump, but I thought I would never find a hairspray without a strong odor - they go hand in hand and are overpowering. Product showed up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con is the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use it for long before Arbonne International released a botanically based Pure Vibrance hairspray. Finally I have fallen in love with hairspray (and their new hair serum as well). A light plant based smell that is not noticeable, does not linger once sprayed on.  My search is over...but it did not end with this product - although it was the best I had found up until the Arbonne release.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair spray as a gift.  My mom really likes it because there is no scent.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived as described.  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> My dad has horrible eczema on his scalp and other hairsprays were burning his head. He has no burning or issues with this spray and it has holding power.</li>
    <li> Used it for years because of allergies.</li>
    <li> Its a very wet hair spray</li>
    <li> I use this hairspray exclusively since developing contact dermatitis to Ylang Ylang fragrance.  So many of my patients have developed allergies to other fragrances too, so why risk it?  I use all the Vanicream and Free and Clear products which contain no fragrances or parabens or other allergens.  I like reducing exposure to unnecessary chemicals as much as possbile.</li>
    <li> Love it! it is the only product that helped my moms scalp issues. would like to see specials on it. price is a little high.</li>
    <li> When my dermatologist told me that my hair products were contributing to my acne and oiling skin, I went crazy looking for oil free products since my hair style mattered a lot to me.  I always gel (or wax) and then use a hair spray to hold the style in place, and I knew I had to find a product that would go well with my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairspray is probably moderate to moderately strong.  It will hold but needs time to dry, but the amount in the bottle lasts quite a while.  I used one bottle and it lasted probably almost half a year (I style my hair basically every day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish amazon would carry this in prime again...</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairspray due to my boyfriend having severe asthma.  This hairspray is wonderful.....it does not cause him any issues breathing like the rest of the hairsprays I used/tried and the hold is amazing.  I also use much less than I normally  do.  I would recommend this hairspray for anyone.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to all hair products, sprays, gels...anything with with a certain chemical or perfume and unscented products just dont cut it.  This really is the best product for people with sensitivities. I cant believe I found this stuff!!!  Do not hesitate it is worth every penny and it really holds my hairstyle well.  WOO HOO no more itchy, watering, burning eyes :)</li>
    <li> Ugh.  This product stinks worse than the Suave hairspray that I had to stop using because the smell was irritating me.  This is definitely not worth the hefty pricetag.</li>
    <li> Still breaks me out. Hives.</li>
    <li> Not as ideal for a chemically sensitive/MCS patient as I would have hoped.</li>
    <li> No odor and great control....  everything I need in a hair spray</li>
    <li> Only hair spray that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky mess on the floor of my bathroom</li>
    <li> This is a good product that Works well for me  and it Keeps hair in place in any type of weather.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Due to allergies, only hair spray I can use.  My hair stylist tried it and likes it for his customers who have skin/respiratory sensitivities.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes it might relieve the itchy scalp (thinking I might be allergic to normal hairsprays).  It did not seem to change the itchiness.  As for hold, it makes my hair kind of stiff, but then doesn&#x27;t seem to hold very well.  If this hairspray was the only thing I could use because of allergies, I would probably continue to purchase it.  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference for me, so I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have written reviews for this before. Super, super spray for your hair.  My dermatologist recommended it to me and I love it.  You have to be careful not to over spray or it will really HOLD your hair.  Light spray does the trick.  I buy this from Amazon all the time and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Have to use both hands to spray, if not, then it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; , it drips out on to your face, shoulders etc.&lt;br /&gt;Also, makes hair look wet, and very stiff, if not sprayed properly.</li>
    <li> was hard to pump and just spit out.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t give you a helmet head hold, but it works okay. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any lingering smells. No headaches or feeling like I&#x27;ve been poisoned by a cloud of toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> My husband is highly sensitive to perfumes/fragrances and in the past 20 years is has been almost impossible to find a hair spray without ANY oder.... the one I used for years was discfontinued and this is the only one on the market that I have been able to find.....&lt;br /&gt;Jean Wallace</li>
    <li> There is really little smell to it which is great, but it is like glue. It makes my hair VERY stiff and heavy. I usually get extra hold products, but this one is too much. I might try their lighter hold hairspray.</li>
    <li> This stuff is excellent. No smell and no irritation at all. Good price and holds well. Do yourself a favor and get some. Regular over the counter hairspray is loaded with toxins and irritants.</li>
    <li> I am trying to get as many allergens out of my life as possible so I thought I would try this hair spray.  I love it!  It has a very firm hold but is easy to brush out and my hair is shiny.  I just placed a second order and will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> This is great hairspray. I got this because it was unscented for the HCG diet. I use it now on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I really like this hairspray.  I cannot use regular hairspray or I would be washing my hair way too often.  Regular hairspray makes me itch like crazy.  This does not cause me any itching or sensitivity problems.  Bonus is that it works!  Maybe not strong enough for a bouffant but it works well for me.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a product that works and does not weight my hair down.  Brushes out easily. Soft to the touch---not sticky.</li>
    <li> This is good for everyday use.  There is no scent or sticky feel, which helps for allergy sensitive noses and scalps.</li>
    <li> This product is advertised as unscented. While it does not seem to have added perfumes, the actual ingredients in it do have a scent. If you have chemical sensitivities this is not the product for you. Mine kicked up after one small spritz. I tried to return it but the seller said since I had \\&quot;used\\&quot; it they would not take it back. I literally spritzed the smallest amount possible just to test it to see if it smelled when applied to my hair. Needless to say I was disappointed at having wasted my money!</li>
    <li> If you need a fragrance free hair product, this one holds beautifully and it isn&#x27;t too sticky.</li>
    <li> My husband has a sensitive scalp and the hairspray that he was using from the store broke him out in his scalp.  So we found this product and he is not having anymore itchy scalp issues.</li>
