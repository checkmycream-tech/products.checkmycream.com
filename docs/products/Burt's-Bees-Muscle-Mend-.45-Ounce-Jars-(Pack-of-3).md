      <li>pleasantly tingly (wonderful on my neck &amp; back in the morning!), and refreshingly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>My favorite balm.  </li>

      <li>I like this product because it works for pain relief and the odor is pleasant more so than some of the other similar products.  </li>
      <li>Definitely recommend! :)</li>
      <li>More importantly, it&#x27;s VERY different from any Muscle Mend</li>
      <li>Then I started purchasing it from Amazon&#x27;s different suppliers, a task that&#x27;s not so easy -- varying prices, deliveries, you know the drill.</li>
      <li>Made a huge difference to know that he wasn&#x27;t in so much pain and could finally get some sleep.</li>
      <li>Even the smell is very relaxing to me.</li>
      <li>Takes the pain away fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really soothing and relieves the muscle discomfort better than any other menthol pain relief I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
      <li>It works better than every other muscle soothing product I have tried.</li>
      <li>This usually does the trick for my knee and neck arthritis pain, but if I need something that works a little better with more intense heat</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin, but strong enough to help relax and soothe sore muscles, no matter why they&#x27;re sore.</li>
      <li>It is much hotter and seems to open up the pores a little better.  </li>
      <li>It is strong in scent, so be careful, but it will open you up while it eases your aches!</li>
      <li>This is a hard product to find &amp; we love it.  </li>
      <li>Does not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Seems much stronger that all the other pain rubs we&#x27;ve tried.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I strained something in my elbow when assisting my disabled and somewhat overweight husband to stand, and I tried several other OTC remedies with limited success in relieving the pain in my elbow. After one application of Muscle Mend, the pain was gone. I am now ordering the three-pack. Burt&#x27;s Bees ResQ Ointment is also a very effective product that I cannot do without. In addition to the effective healing properties of these products, I enjoy the herbal aroma, which is conducive to relaxation.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Muscle Mend -- subscribed and received the 3-pack monthly until Amazon discontinued that service. Then I started purchasing it from Amazon&#x27;s different suppliers, a task that&#x27;s not so easy -- varying prices, deliveries, you know the drill. This particular order arrived, late, untracked, with the vendor saying only that it would arrive &amp;#34;soon.&amp;#34; It did, but not with the promptness or tracking of an &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; order. More importantly, it&#x27;s VERY different from any Muscle Mend I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s grainy, like sand that doesn&#x27;t melt or change. Just sits on the skin. I pitched mine and ordered from a different company.</li>
    <li> I relied on a bath and body works product that is no longer in production to alleviate tension in my neck and headaches. I have looked for a similar replacement with no luck, and then I stumbled across this. I have been a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees face products for years and have to say I am now a fan of the muscle mend.</li>
    <li> My favorite balm.  Helps relieve muscle pain, pleasantly tingly (wonderful on my neck &amp; back in the morning!), and refreshingly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When combined with some peppermint lipbalm, sunblock, and water, there are few other things I need on an outing (except maybe sandwiches and granola bars... it depends on how long I&#x27;m out!).</li>
    <li> My little 6 year old boy was having a hard time sleeping because of growing pains/aches in his legs. We tried Tylenol and other things but to no avail. When we used B B Muscle Mend (at the suggestion of a friend) he was back to sleep within minutes of applying it!! Made a huge difference to know that he wasn&#x27;t in so much pain and could finally get some sleep.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It helps relax my lower back pain, especially when I use it with a heating pad. Even the smell is very relaxing to me. My Only Complaint is the small size of the jars available. Less than half an ounce is not a lot. Definitely recommend and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great for muscle aches and soreness!</li>
    <li> Takes the pain away fast. Puts you right to sleep though.  Seems much stronger that all the other pain rubs we&#x27;ve tried. Does not irritate sensitive skin. Smells good too. Clears your nose. It will make your application hand feel good too, just wash throughly BEFORE you pet your cat.</li>
    <li> Love this product really works well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great as usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will get it again anytime!  I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t sell it at stores</li>
    <li> I use this product on myself &amp; family members when we get migraines or regular headaches. It is so helpful for getting the tense muscles to relax in a natural way.  I only wish it came in a bigger container, but a little bit goes a long way, so it has lasted for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s really soothing and relieves the muscle discomfort better than any other menthol pain relief I&#x27;ve tried before. The smell is not overpowering either. Definitely recommend! :)</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
    <li> This is a hard product to find &amp; we love it.  This is the stuff we reach for anytime we have aches or pains.  We buy i again and again!</li>
    <li> This has been amazing for my shoulder pain, my husband&#x27;s muscle aches (he does manual labor all day), and my father&#x27;s gout in his foot. It is an overall amazing product. It is strong in scent, so be careful, but it will open you up while it eases your aches!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin, but strong enough to help relax and soothe sore muscles, no matter why they&#x27;re sore. We&#x27;ve used it on pulled muscles, overworked muscles, and aches and pains from a cold. All responded well!</li>
    <li> This is some great stuff. It works better than most other rubs without the burn. Lasts longer too. My family all love it. It also helps me breathe easier with my asthma.</li>
    <li> I have chronic back pain and this was recommended to me by a masseuse. I ordered it and have not been disappointed! It does the trick, just be careful not to get it in your eye.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it works for pain relief and the odor is pleasant more so than some of the other similar products.  This usually does the trick for my knee and neck arthritis pain, but if I need something that works a little better with more intense heat I use Tiger Balm.  It is much hotter and seems to open up the pores a little better.  Still, this product is good and if you don&#x27;t like the overpowering odor of Tiger Balm, Icy Hot, etc, this one works well too.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works better than every other muscle soothing product I have tried. The scent is not too overbearing, but will definitely open up your sinuses. It is a pretty small container, but a little goes a long way. My last container lasted almost a year with occasional use.</li>
