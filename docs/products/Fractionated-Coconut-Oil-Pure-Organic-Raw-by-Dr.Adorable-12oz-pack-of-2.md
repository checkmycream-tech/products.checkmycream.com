<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this off ebay for a great price (16 oz bottle though). It appears from peoes comments that it is edible, that was the only question I had. It is a better price than the 3.5 oz bottle doTERRA sells. It works great with my doTERRA essential oils!</li>
    <li> Nice price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality at a pretty affordable price!!! I bought this as a carrier oil with my essential oils, and it works very well - less &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling than most. The only downfall was one of the lids wasn&#x27;t on tight enough and it had leaked all over the rest of my order - no damage thankfully!</li>
    <li> It was as expected, but did not realize it had no coconut fragrance. A good oil, though.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product.  I use it as a carrier oil with my essential oils and have been very impressed with the quality and quantity for the price.</li>
    <li> love the product and the disbursement cap, doesnt let it all just flow out all at once  and keeps you from making a mess by accident. Great Oil. Love it. Packed well  and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I use this in lieu of lotion. I add a little bit of lavender oil and gardenia oil for scent.</li>
    <li> Great price and blends well with my essential oils</li>
    <li> High quality organic coconut oil.  Great product!  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Seems to be ok but haven&#x27;t been able to use much of it just yet. How does fractionated coconut oil differ from the kind you buy in the store that hardens when it gets cold?</li>
    <li> Awesome carrier oil! I use this as a base for essential oils and find it great to work with. I highly recommend this oil for that purpose!</li>
    <li> Love this FCO! Such a great value, not too greasy!</li>
    <li> Received item the next day. I have purchased this oil before and is as described.</li>
    <li> I use this with essential oils and it is my every day moisturizer</li>
    <li> This product is not correct. The description is wrong it says 24oz. LOOK CLOSELY AT THE PICTURE. THE BOTTLE IS LABLED 12oz. So that is what you will receive 1-12oz bottle not 24oz. So this is a really extermely overpriced bottle of FCO. However it is very good quality oil. Very clear and absorbs quickly. Would have been 5 stars but the fact that i paid 23 bucks for only 12 ounces I am over that.</li>
    <li> I like it for a moisturizer after my shower.</li>
    <li> Good carrier oil....good all around for moisturizing....</li>
    <li> Taken internally in my coffee.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I love it, my husband loves it and it works great for his eczema. Already have it on order again.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product! We have ordered this several times and will continue. We use this to dilute our essential oils. Clear, no smell, not greasy. This is the best price I have found. I only wish they would ship it so that they don&#x27;t leak. They don&#x27;t leak a lot, but just enough to make it necessary to wipe down the outside of the bottles.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I use it to dilute my doterra oils!</li>
    <li> Great product, reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Great Price, Great Product.</li>
    <li> Really neat and has so many uses</li>
    <li> great product. will work with again!</li>
    <li> Great deal!  It works great to mix with my doTerra essential oils for smooth application.  This is the only kind I will buy from now on.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I highly recommend this product. Shipping was great</li>
    <li> The 24 oz was out of stock so two 12&#x27;s were substituted.  Pleased with the quality so far.  Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I use this oil as a carrier oil when applying Doterra&#x27;s essential oils.  great product.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by 1) how quickly this was able to be shipped and 2) the quality of the oil for the price I paid and the quantity received. i will purchase again for future essential oil creations!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  No unpleasant odor.  Liked the price compared to most others out there.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in great time and great shape! I use this with my do TERRA EO&#x27;s and love it!</li>
    <li> While this oil is a bit more expensive for the amount you get, it&#x27;s well worth the more expensive price. I use this oil in my sugar scrub recipes. Everyone raves about the feeling of their skin after. It&#x27;s not greasy, and leaves a moisturized feel.</li>
    <li> LOVE... will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> works great, and great value.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for - good price!</li>
    <li> I love the results I have gotten from oil pulling, however, I have difficulty melting coconut oil in my mouth.  It makes me gag, then I get nauseous.  After that happens I can only oil pull for about 5 minutes.  When I use this oil, I can oil pull for the recommended 20 minutes.  I also use it as a carrier oil for my Young Living Essential Oil blends.</li>
    <li> Love this as a carrier for my essential oils</li>
    <li> Great for mixing with essential oils.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil worked for my basic needs and it is a good product BUT it was advertised as fractionated coconut oil and when I received my shipment, it was just organic coconut oil. I was a little disappointed but it wasn&#x27;t worth arguing or returning.</li>
    <li> This is my second order.  Love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fabulous!! I use it to dilute my essential oils works perfectly fine!😆</li>
    <li> I use this for oil pulling every morning and my teeth have never been whiter and stronger.</li>
    <li> Great for use with doterra essential oils.</li>
    <li> Purchase this on a regular basis and use with all of my doTerra essential oil blends.  Quality FCO, competitive price and always arrives quickly and in good packaging.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Simple very good quality coconut oil. I use it as a carrier oil with my essential oils. Coconut oil is best as a carrier oil as it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores like other carrier oils can.</li>
    <li> This would&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars except that some of the oil had leaked during shipping.</li>
    <li> Love it, so glad I found it. I have regular organic cold pressed virgin coconut oil that I use with my essential oils.  Sometimes I use this fractionated coconut oil with my essential oils but I really love it for oil pulling.  Since it&#x27;s clear it&#x27;s much easier to tell that you&#x27;re getting impurities out of your mouth because when you spit the oil goes from clear to a milky white.</li>
    <li> Great product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Was sent cold pressed not fractured coconut oil. Received 3 stars because the they refunded me and the cold pressed is good quality just not what I ordered.</li>
    <li> About 3 years ago I tried a number of oils and combination of oils for the Oil Cleansing System, and it worked in relieving my dry skin. About 2 months in I started to get bad break outs and when it didn&#x27;t get better over the next 4 months I gave up and went back to traditional face cleansers and dry skin. After ordering this product to dilute my EOs I decided to try it for cleaning my face and IT WORKS. Soft, nourished skin and no more breakouts than normal. This product has become my go to for cleanser, lotion, oil pulling, and diluting EOs and I will buy it again and again...</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Not cloudy, blends well with essential oils!</li>
    <li> This oil is organic and pure and works really well for essential oils.</li>
    <li> Love this product delivered.  on time.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to try Dr Adorables fractionated coconut oil. I was searching for a reasonably priced oil and it was important for it to be organic.  Dr Adorables oil is non greasy, unscented and soaks right into the skin.  I was primarily looking for an oil to use use as carrier oil for essential oils, but have found that it works well as a night cream also.  I am very pleased with my purchase of this high quality oil and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use fractionated coconut oil as a carrier for essential oils so I go through it rather quickly.  Not only is the oil organic and good quality, it is a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great oil used for everything!</li>
    <li> I love how soft it makes my skin feel and it&#x27;s not so greasy.</li>
    <li> I use many different kinds of oils to make skin care, moisturizers, etc. This is by far, my families favorite. There is no scent, so it doesn&#x27;t change the smell of what I&#x27;m making and won&#x27;t interfere with my Essential oils. It stays liquid so I have even used it in a spray bottle to make an after sun spray. This oil is light and soaks in. My husband does not like any carrier oils on him when I use Essential oils except this one. And this one he will use alone for dry skin. He says it isn&#x27;t sticky and slimy. LOVE THIS OIL&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I keep buying this oil from Dr. Adorable! I love it -- feels great--perfect for massage or as a moisturizer! Best price from Dr. Adorable! Packaging is minimal which I like--you see what you get...and you know when you are running low so you can order more!</li>
    <li> Perfect for diluting essential oils.</li>
    <li> Works well in roller bottles with my essential oils.  Slightly less viscous than the FCO from doTerra.</li>
    <li> Will be ordering it again!</li>
    <li> Needs to be sealed better. Both bottles leaked</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this organic oil.  This oil blends well with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Use for mouth pulling.  Cold pressed, and great value!</li>
    <li> Product is exactly what I was looking for. I have used it for cooking and also for mixing Essential Oils.</li>
    <li> This oil works great as a carrier oil for other essential oils. I like the fact that it is organic.</li>
    <li> perfect to use with my essential oils!</li>
    <li> LOVE this oil!!! My whole family uses it as a moisturizer, along with using it with our essential oils. Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Bought 2.... One leaked all over the bag and box.</li>
    <li> Great product and more economical than if purchased through essential oil distributors.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Was exactly what I was looking for. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> You get a good amount for the price.</li>
    <li> just a regular mineral oil. Don&#x27;t buy it !!!</li>
    <li> this is a great oil.  I have used it several times.  just amazing to use. none greasy and leave the skin smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> Very nice FCO, use it for multiple applications.</li>
    <li> perfect to start my new oil hobby</li>
    <li> Great oil, started blending essential oils right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s suppose to but it does not smell like coconut and it appears diluted, confused about this product...</li>
    <li> Product was packaged nicely for shipping. Very happy with quality of oil.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Helped with my growing belly bump</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is the best facial moisturizer ever, but I get overwhelmed by the coconut odor, so this is the perfect product for me.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Important for all of your essential oil mixing needs.  Product was as advertised and arrived in good condition and it is sold at a good price.</li>
    <li> I use this as a moisturizer carrier with essential oil and love it.  It absorbs very quickly -- perfect for post shower slather.  Essential oils give you lots of fragrance options</li>
    <li> This is a great carrier oil for my doTerra oils. I find its great way to save money and increase the time the oils stay on the skin instead of evaporating.</li>
    <li> Great Product and good price with fast delivery</li>
