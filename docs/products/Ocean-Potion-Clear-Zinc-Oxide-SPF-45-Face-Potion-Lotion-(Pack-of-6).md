      <li>By far this is the best sun screen I have used.</li>

      <li>Ocean Potion Face seems to have the best of both worlds - goes on white-ish so you can see that you&#x27;re covered, goes clear if you just rub a bit, and never left any color or residue in my clothing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very greatful to be able to order Faces 45 and receive it so quickly.  </li>

      <li>I ordered Face Ocean Potion, applied it before going into the sun, and my nose healed quickly.  </li>
      <li>a good product for long ex.</li>
      <li>so I apply a little more every 40 minutes or so just to be sure.  </li>
      <li>Their sunscreen washed off in the water the first day and they got sunburned.</li>
      <li>I teach swim lessons for 4-6 hours a day over the summer, so that it really saying something.</li>

      <li>Walmart brand is really bad for me--I can only use Ocean Potion Face 45!---Glad I found Cosmetic Solutions great price!!!</li>
      <li>It has clear zinc oxide and is not greasy.  </li>
      <li>I thought this product was just clear zinc oxide per the labeling - it has all of the sunscreen chemicals in it that I am trying to avoid putting on my children&#x27;s faces.  </li>
      <li>This clear zinc oxide can be rubbed in so I don&#x27;t look like a cartoon character.</li>
      <li>Goes on clear, not greasy and it blends so well when you wear make up.</li>

<li> Formula changed from a couple of years ago, used to go on clear, now has a slight white cast that shows up on darker skin tones.</li>
<li> Waterproof for 80 minutes so keep reapplying if outside for long.</li>
<li> not really clear bt served its purpose.</li>
<li> My spots are slowly going away, thanks to Faces 45.  </li>
<li> Use this ALL summer long on my kids!</li>
<li> Some also have other chemicals which stained my clothes yellow or orange.</li>
<li> I brought out my 3 little tubs of FACE 45, and that was the last I saw of it.  </li>
<li> It goes on as a white cream but disappears after a few minutes.  </li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way with the cream.</li>
<li> I have tried other sun screens for my face</li>
<li> But the only thing that has ever worked for me is zinc oxide which usually looks like a mask on my face.</li>

<li> After trying lots of other products this is what we ise.</li>
<li> My house is littered with half the sunscreens on the market, it seems.</li>
<li> Used it for years and always protects my face without feeling heavy.</li>
<li> I have sun damaged skin on my face, from my past negligence.  </li>
<li> These are usually like $5 in the store.</li>
<li> Major disappointment since I bought a multi pack</li>
<li> Note that these containers have false bottoms</li>

    <li> I want zinc in my sunscreen, to block both UV and infrared, but most do not have it. Those that do tend to leave a white paste on your skin that rubs off on your clothes. Some also have other chemicals which stained my clothes yellow or orange. Ocean Potion Face seems to have the best of both worlds - goes on white-ish so you can see that you&#x27;re covered, goes clear if you just rub a bit, and never left any color or residue in my clothing. Used to buy at Target, but they no longer sell so mail-order was required. Note that these containers have false bottoms so they look as big as 2 ounce containers but only contain the advertised 1 ounce of product.</li>
    <li> I had been able to get Faces 45 at WalMart for years and cannot find it there anymore.  I would stock up during the summer, knowing I would not be able to get it during the winter.  I came so close to running out, I was frantic.  I have sun damaged skin on my face, from my past negligence.  My spots are slowly going away, thanks to Faces 45.  I have tried other sun screens for my face and I broke out like when I was a teenager.  Faces 45 works very well for me, no break outs and it does not cost like the others I&#x27;ve tried and did not like.  I&#x27;m very greatful to be able to order Faces 45 and receive it so quickly.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Glad I found my Faces 45 again.</li>
    <li> I purchased Ocean Potion #45 for my wife, who has been using it for years</li>
    <li> Being allergic to most face creams and other suncreens, this is a pleasure to use.  I just cannot keep enough of it around since my granddaughter and friends discovered it.  Their sunscreen washed off in the water the first day and they got sunburned. I brought out my 3 little tubs of FACE 45, and that was the last I saw of it.  I will order some now for stocking stuffers!</li>
    <li> Ocean Potion face sunblock is great for children, it is easy to apply, does not burn and blocks the sun&#x27;s harmful rays. After trying lots of other products this is what we ise. Waterproof for 80 minutes so keep reapplying if outside for long.</li>
    <li> Im in the sun 40 hrs a week. By far this is the best sun screen I have used. I put it on once in the morning and Im set. Sometimes if I remember, I reapply after lunch. A little bit goes a long way with the cream. barely leaves a residue on your hands. This will be the only sun screen I buy</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen ever!  And great service!  Thanks</li>
    <li> wish it was available at stores&lt;br /&gt;always a good product for long ex. in water. delivery was quick / would order again</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and this product is the ONLY one I am able to use on my face with NO breakout!!

    <li> Used this for years, cannot find in the stores anymore. Goes on clear, not greasy and it blends so well when you wear make up. No skin reactions and it has no scent. Best sunscreen EVER</li>
    <li> Favorite face sunscreen.</li>

    <li> My nose really started to blister and it suddenly got red.  I ordered Face Ocean Potion, applied it before going into the sun, and my nose healed quickly.  It goes on as a white cream but disappears after a few minutes.  You don&#x27;t feel any grease or film, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to run.  It must give excellent protection because I have no sign of being burned.  I could be in the sun playing tennis for more than 2 hours at a time and it works.  The label says good for 80 minutes so I apply a little more every 40 minutes or so just to be sure.  100% satisfied!</li>

    <li> I love this sunscreen.  It has clear zinc oxide and is not greasy.  Goes on really smoothly, feels light. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> not really clear bt served its purpose. won&#x27;t buy again.</li>

    <li> Used it for years and always protects my face without feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> I have been using (Face) for several years and it is the only thing I use for my face...I am a light reflection red-head and burn easily so I finally found something that protects me when out in the sun! Delivery and service was great!</li>
