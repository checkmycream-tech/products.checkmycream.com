<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the color, I love the soft brushes. My brothers did manager to snap one in half though ):</li>
    <li> They work great bristles are nice &amp; soft, the smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as some reviews stated</li>
    <li> some of the heads on these I had to fix, they were loose and I had to fix, no instructions as to what some do, over all not bad just not great.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this because of the color, but I was too stubborn to listen to the earlier reviews on the cheap quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are so soft that they don&#x27;t pick up make-up. I have to try 3x harder with these brushes. The only good thing about these brushes are the eyebrow comb and mascara wand. Be forewarned...</li>
    <li> Gave for gifts and plan to order for me!  great set!  super for gifts or your own use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice carry bag too</li>
    <li> My only down side and request is to put in a small angled brush instead of three lip brushes, other than that I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excelent for that price, the where chea but i buy it anyways and it was a good sorprise to see them work nice.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge makeup person and I even had to ask my friend what all the little ones were for (I rarely use eyeshadow). The fan brush has begin to look like a used toothbrush and I have only used it about 10 times. It is possible that I just need to wash it, but it&#x27;s gotten pretty big. The other brushes are extremely soft, they feel wonderful on my skin, but don&#x27;t put my makeup on like I would like it to. I use blush and I have to press down very hard or use multiple coats with the brush in order for any color to show up on my skin. HOWEVER....the entire kit is worth buying simply for the eyeshadow sponge brush. It is perfect, works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and I have begun to wear eyeshadow daily simply because it is so easy to apply with this brush.</li>
    <li> Soft brushes!. And the color on them is awesome!.. A must have if you do casual everyday makeup on yourself.</li>
    <li> I am always loosing makeup applicators this is just what I needed..My daughter wants me to buy her one which I will, soon</li>
    <li> Best (nonprofessional) brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!!! I had these for about a year and six months and the only problem I had with them was the biggest powder to brush handle came off but other than that these brushes are amazing!!  I love them a lot!!! I just threw mine away two days ago and I&#x27;m ordering some more today!  The packaging stayed together very very well and I think my favorite brush out of the whole that is the big powder brush!  Brushes are great for first-timers they work like a charm their great!  The plus side if you lose one are extras!! And you can&#x27;t beat the price! Have fun with ur new brushes!!</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes and I love them they are so pretty and soft. It took about a week to come in so I didn&#x27;t have to wait super long. Overall I would purchase these again cause I love them.</li>
    <li> Some people say these are poorly made, bristles keep coming out and things like this but I&#x27;ve been using these for months and they are just great. Nothing has happened to them plus they are super cute! I love and use all the brushes.</li>
    <li> I love the mac brushs great buy</li>
    <li> I bought this as a x-mas present, she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I chose this set over other products</li>
    <li> The brushes are falling out, i think the brushes are dryed out.</li>
    <li> Love them!! Very soft brushes and cute color! Great case to! Well worth it!! Exactly what was looking for and great price</li>
    <li> It was a present for someone and they loved it. I would recommend this to someone for themselves or for someone else.</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect...i have tons of brushes that shedd some are to soft or to hard..but these r perfect.. yet to have shedd. Came packaged great the case does have a paint smell to it but that is fine i can live wit it...and the price is great...and its my favorite color purple...i would tell my family to buy them</li>
    <li> i was so excited that i got is my old brushes broke so when i saw these i though that it would be cool to have them and the purple bag was so helpful and they are so soft and i hope that they will last me a long time and they are so good at spreading the makeup around your face they make it look natural so soft on your face.</li>
    <li> These brushes are like in the picture but even better in person they are crazy soft &amp; really really cute already used a few of them &amp; they do an amazing job</li>
    <li> These are totally worth it for the price i use them everyday. Some of the brush hairs (not sure exactly what they are called lol) but quite a few of them started falling out the first time i used the brushes but it only happened the first couple times  i used them so i&#x27;m assuming that it&#x27;s normal. They work very well though and have even held up through me cleaning them.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;these are soft &amp; work perfect. i love em. I&#x27;m going to buy a set for my cousin. the bag does smell but they were packaged very well.\\&quot;---was my first response to the brush set...however time has passed and I don&#x27;t love em not so much anymore. the eyeshadow brushes are horrible!! The only brushes I enjoy using would be the larger brushes the blush brush and powder brush. These brushes do not have names on them and I am a beginner of using brushes for makeup the names on the brushes would be handy for me.</li>
    <li> They arrived just yesterday and I love them. They are so soft, they has a faint smell of paint on them but not so bad that I can&#x27;t deal with plus I love the purple tips, my favorite color.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really soft as previously stated in other reviews! I wanted something a little different than the regular brown or black bristle brushes usually found. These are real nice. I just wish there was blending brush included in the set.</li>
    <li> For the price these are not bad. I ordered them for Halloween makeup because i did not want to stain or ruin my good brushes but these were surprisingly nice, soft and not shedding too bad. the case is just ok but the brushes are worth the price. i would order again. i got doubles of the same brush but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me. all in all, a good value.</li>
    <li> Been using these for a year and they still are in good shape!</li>
    <li> this is an ok item for the price charged, they will be for a teenager, first time using brushes. if you want quality spend a bit more, i knew these were for a teenager so i didnt plan on spending too much.</li>
    <li> I adore these brushes! I love the colors, that was the main reason I wanted them. The bristles are very soft. They pick up product well, and my makeup blends so perfectly and effortlessly with these brushes! On the large powder brush a small amount of the paint is chipped where the handle meets the ferrule (the metal part) but it&#x27;s not something that affects the use of the brush so it doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit. I did want to mention it though. As I noted in some other reviews when I first opened the package the brush roll and brushes did smell quite strongly like paint. You&#x27;re supposed to wash your brushes before using them though - after I washed them and they dried they just smelled &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; - nothing offensive left behind. I also tossed the brush roll into the washer with a load of towels and hung it up to dry. It still has a faint &amp;#34;pleather&amp;#34; smell as expected - it&#x27;s just the nature of that material - but it&#x27;s not as bad as when I first opened up the package. I have had no issues with shedding. They clean up as well as any other makeup brushes after they&#x27;ve been used a bit and need washed to remove product build-up in the bristles. I adore them and would definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> Great quality...good price and variety of brushes.  Easily cleanable and doesn&#x27;t lose bristols. Love the case it is also well made.</li>
    <li> Love these. Still in good shape after months of using them.</li>
    <li> Just recieved it in the mail I love but already thanks . Since I&#x27;m not a pro at applying makeup I can use these to help me.</li>
    <li> These work Great! The fan brush was a little rough looking upon opening but that&#x27;s not a brush I use anyway. And I love the purple brush tips. They look really cool and everything matches. Very good deal and very cheap, although these probably need more frequent replacing than an expensive set.</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous set. i love it.. its affordable and brings great quality. the hairs dont fall out, its really super duper soft !!</li>
    <li> I think this set works for a non professional because the bushes become loose after a couple uses but that can be fixed. It works for me and my everyday use but next time i think i will get something a little more sturdy. Overall i like these brushes but not in love with them.</li>
    <li> Thanks , I love the color and they are so soft , i use them every day .....thanks a lot for your services....</li>
    <li> This product worked like magic! They smelled funny at first kind of like paint but I love these brushes and I would most definitely recommend this to ANYONE!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because they looked so cute and they are however they dnt work as well as i expected. the only brushes i like and actually use are the powder brush and the brow brush. These brushes also shed. i always need to be pulling off hair off my face after every application. I guess its ok for the price.</li>
    <li> Brought this lovely gift for my babysitter&#x27;s birthday. She cried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And proudly showed it to party attendants.</li>
    <li> They came with a funny smell. But I sprayed perfume on them and that should take care of that. They&#x27;re so soft and great quality I love the color.</li>
    <li> This brushes are awsome.I saw that some girl complain about the smell but my came smelling nothing like that.The color on the case and brushes is really nice and I absolutely love them I recomend them to people that love nakeup...</li>
    <li> 2 years later and I am still using most of these brushes. I routinely clean them as I use them pretty often. The faux leather purple carrying case is durable and easy to clean. The brushes are all pretty durable, it was only recently that I had the glue fail on one brush; having the head disconnect from the handle. That was after two years of use, and was easily remedied with a little hot glue.</li>
    <li> The brushes feels nice and soft. Was exactly what I wanted and packaged neatly. Nothing was broken or seemed damaged. The only problem I had with the brushes and the pouch is that it smells like glue. I just threw the pouch in the washer machine to see if I could get rid of the smell because it is really strong and then use some brush cleaner and shampoo to clean the brushes. It looks brand new. Just smells like glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing the brushes the smell came out. After washing the pouch,soaking it in shampoo, spraying it with febreze... the smell never came out!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft like I&#x27;ve expected! For a cheap price I believe that it&#x27;s well worth it. Also, the brushes are adorably cute; the color. The case is nice as well. I love it! There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: One of the brushes fell apart. I just glued it back and it&#x27;s good to go!</li>
    <li> Very cute brushes, super soft and all is included! I would for sure by this agian! Great find for a great price!</li>
    <li> I read previous reviews regarding the paint smell of this product &amp; it does come w/ that smell, but after 3 uses it went away. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s due to the purple tips on each brush. (Don&#x27;t worry, the purple doesn&#x27;t run or get all over your face or anything.) The brushes are super soft so if you have sensitive skin (like me) then these will work really well for you. My makeup goes on smoothly &amp; so far, I&#x27;ve had no issues w/ the brushes. Highly recommend if you need a new application set if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
