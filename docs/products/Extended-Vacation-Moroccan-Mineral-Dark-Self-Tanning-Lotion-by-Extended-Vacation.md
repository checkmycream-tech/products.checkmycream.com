      <li>I love this self tanner.</li>

      <li>i was very excited about this product because of the reviews.</li>
      <li>I have a nice toasty tan like I&#x27;ve been at the beach for a few days and the smell was great, I didn&#x27;t even notice it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I EXFOLIATED WITH THE CHAACOCOA MOROCCAN EXFOLIATING MITT, MOISTURIZED KNEES AND ELBOWS WITH PURE COCONUT OIL AND APPLIED THE MINERAL TAN ALL OVER, EVEN MY FACE. IT DOES LOOK &amp;#34;DIRTY&amp;#34; IN PLACES WHERE APPLIED, WENT TO BED AND THEN  SHOWERED NEXT MORNING AND IT LOOKS GREAT! LOOKS NATURAL AND SUN -KISSED BROWN. I DID NOTICE A SELF TAN SCENT TO MY SKIN BUT IT WAS EASILY MASKED WITH MY PERFUME. I&#x27;M ON MY 4TH DAY SINCE TANNING AND IT STILL LOOKS GREAT, FACE IS LIGHTER THOUGH.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  It gives you more of a brown, than orange color. I have naturally light skin, but tan super fast.  One application gave me good color. I did find that it smells like the cheap stuff as it is developing.  One other issue.  The stuff has brown dye in it that helps you get it everywhere.  It is a little un nerving at first, but you don&#x27;t miss spots.  It is very dark color, streaky not subtle or natural looking.  I put the stuff on in the early afternoon and realized I had to leave the house later...opps.  You aren&#x27;t supposed to shower for 6 hours, so I had to go out looking like a freak. Good news is when you shower the dye rinses away and leaves a great looking tan.  Not sure how long it will last though hopefully long like it claims because of the cost.  It took about 1/4 of the bottle and I&#x27;m only 5 ft  avg weight.  I did paint realistic tan lines as well.  Give it a try...best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve used...most expensive as well.</li>
    <li> i was very excited about this product because of the reviews. however, when i got it the bottle was much smaller than i expected (should have read how many ounces it was) this product did not meet my expectations and did not give me the dark tan i hoped. it gave me a slight tan. it is also on the expensive side. the thing i liked was when the tan does fade away it fades evenly and you will not end up with streaks. im still looking for that tan that will give me the darkest tan possible and this is not it.</li>
    <li> I am a Mystic Tan person but can&#x27;t always go to a booth.  This is the absolute BEST self tanner I have ever used and I will be heart broken if they ever discontinue it!!  Having had melanoma, I cannot go out into the sun so I depend on the Moroccan Mineral products to keep my color beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. (You can buy this from massage therapy websites for HALF the price FYI-google it, just sayin&#x27;). It&#x27;s a small bottle, but a little goes a long way. I used to use L&#x27;oreal sublime bronze self tanner, I loved the deep tan it gave me, but I hated the sparkly shimmer it had. I decided to give this product a try and I love it. You get immediate color as soon as you apply it and a deep dan develops after a few hours-very natural as well, looks like you&#x27;ve been in the tropics for 2 weeks. Just exfoliate well before application and don&#x27;t overly rub in. If it looks a litte streaky (from over rubbing it in), don&#x27;t worry it will blend in. I usually put this on at night so it develops overnight. I have not had any staining issues on clothing either. Make sure to wash your hands immediatlely after you apply or use gloves to avoid staining your palms. It also has a sugary, almond smell that is so yummy, you would never think it was a self tanner at all!</li>
    <li> I NEVER use a tanning bed or the real sun because of skin cancer problems so I have used a lot of different lotions this is 100% the best by far!! You get a more even natural look but most of all your very first time you notice the difference in how dark you are.I would never use another product again!</li>
    <li> This product works okay and doesn&#x27;t turn mostly orange like some others I&#x27;ve tried.  It IS expensive for the amount you use and at only 6 ounces, comes out to $4.33 per ounce and that doesn&#x27;t include the shipping!  I&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars for the following, A: the price per ounce and B: the ingredient list.  Contains parabens, both methylparaben and proplyparaben along with FD&amp;C Yellow #5, FD&amp;C Red #40 and FD&amp;C Blue #1 (dyes).  These items have been tested and are NOT what you want ON or IN your body!  Read up on it........it may save your life.</li>
    <li> As a model, I have always been on the hunt for the perfect self-tanner. I am fair to light skinned with pink undertones, but need a good bronze glow. I read the reviews, and was looking forward to trying out this product. I do not tan in the sun or tanning beds for health purposes, therefore in the past I have tried literally a hundred (or more!) self-tanners to find those that provide even, DARK color (my first priority), easy application (second- I&#x27;m always in a hurry!) minimal smell (a bonus, really) and cost (don&#x27;t mind paying for quality, however). My FAVORITE product by leaps and bounds has been Quick Tan by Body Drench- an affordable spray that is available here on Amazon. Beautiful dark color, quick application and smells delicious! However, despite my various methods of creating a tan-safe zone, I would always stain the floors and surrounding areas from the overspray. So I figured I&#x27;d give a lotion another try. My feelings about Extended Vacation Moroccan Mineral Dark Self- Tanning product is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Messy Application, must apply with gloves, however fairly easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I also disklike that I have to apply it at night (or anytime that I have six hours&lt;br /&gt;to kill before I wash it off.)&lt;br /&gt;*Decent Color- Very Natural (But not dark enough for what I was hoping for, even&lt;br /&gt;with multiple applications)&lt;br /&gt;*Smells Good&lt;br /&gt;*Fades Naturally&lt;br /&gt;*Moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;*Try not to sweat during the six hours-  my A/C broke during my third use and&lt;br /&gt;I had some sweat marks on my chest. However, I have found this to apply to all self&lt;br /&gt;tanners I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a decent product and good for someone really striving for that \\&quot;natural\\&quot; glow, but in my opinion not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> nice color, lasts for a few days, does rub off on clothes though and need to wash hands consistently while applying</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product after reading the other reviews and it definitely did not let me down.  I am forever trying different products on my quest for the ultimate sunless tan and this one is by far the best.  I&#x27;m extremely fair-skinned and most sunless tanners leave me looking a little orange.  Moroccan Mineral Tan gives me a nice brown color, not streaky at all and very believable...like I used to look after spending a few weeks in the tanning bed.  It smells awesome and spreads very nicely...a little goes a long way.  It took me two applications on two consecutive days to reach my desired shade of brown, but there is still a good deal left in the (unfortunately very small!) bottle.  Definitely apply with gloves as it will stain your hands.  I use a cotton ball to apply a bit to the backs of my hands when I am done and that works really well.  The price is a little hard to swallow, but it&#x27;s well worth it for how real it looks.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Judging by the reviews of this product, I expected a really dark tan with no streaking.  I followed the directions very explicitly - I exfoliated beforehand, used gloves during application, worked slowly and carefully.  The bronzer that is built-in to the formula as a \\&quot;color guide\\&quot; looked great, so I hoped when I woke up the next morning I&#x27;d have a wonderful \\&quot;chocolate\\&quot; color like some of the other reviewers experienced.  However, when I got in the shower and the color guide washed off, I was disappointed to find that I had stripes and streaks all over my legs.  Also the color was more like a very, very light caramel than a \\&quot;chocolate\\&quot;.  I am going to try next time to use more of the product and really pile it on - maybe that&#x27;s where I went wrong.  But so far, I have not been very impressed with this product.  It&#x27;s not worth the high price.</li>
    <li> I love this self tanner. In abou 6 hours your a beautiful bronze color. It smells great and its easy to apply. I never use gloves and it does stain your hands, if you use a face wash scrub and wash your hands it will come out</li>
    <li> I received a nice tan without much effort.  Natural, minimal smell.  Stays natural after re-applying after a few days.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I just tried this for the first time today and am completely amazed at how great my skin looks after only one coat. I have a nice toasty tan like I&#x27;ve been at the beach for a few days and the smell was great, I didn&#x27;t even notice it! Next time, I&#x27;m probably going to apply 2 coats just because I have fair skin and would love to be a little darker. My only complaint about this is that the instructions on the side of the bottle are verrrrry vague. I suggest going to [...] and reading their detailed instructions before applying the lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have tried numerous sunless tanners... all which have their own smell, but this one had a kind of \\&quot;sweet\\&quot;  smell to it... not bad at all.  Most tanners I&#x27;ve tried have left my elbows and knees and feet and hands kind of streaky if you look closely enough. This product doesn&#x27;t seem to do that. My only dislike about this product is the timing.  Once you apply it, which the very first time kind of freaked me out, it is streaky. It looks like you have a mud bath at a spa and didn&#x27;t rinse it all off. Then you have to patiently wait for it to dry before getting dressed. And although it says 20mins, I&#x27;m always apprehensive and like to double the time I&#x27;m given because the last thing I want is for some giant white spots where the tanner didn&#x27;t have enough time to dry to my skin and wipes off on my clothes. THEN you have to wait 6hrs (or your preferred time) before showering it off. Once all is said and done.... it looks GREAT. I noticed after 3ish days it started to fade and THEN was when you could see some streaks, but that is normally when I&#x27;d reapply the product.  I do love the color you get from this, it&#x27;s a very nice brown. I just don&#x27;t like that I feel like I need to dedicate almost an entire day to allowing it to dry and \\&quot;work its magic\\&quot;.  One reviewer said she put it on at bedtime and showered in the morning.... I think I&#x27;ll try that next time because if that works, then this is the perfect product.</li>
    <li> This is the only self tanner I will ever use. Everything else smells disgusting and dries my skin, and the color is more natural than anything I&#x27;ve tried (including spray tans). Whenever I use it, my friends tend to give me the \\&quot;Oh my gosh how did you get so tan?!\\&quot; line.   While it&#x27;s a little pricey, a little bit goes a long way. One bottle typically lasts me about a year, as I usually only use it when I&#x27;m going on vacation or have an event. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous! That&#x27;s the only way to describe the color that the Moroccan Mineral Dark Self Tanning lotion gave me!  With pre-mature age spots at a young age, I have two problems: 1) I love to be tan! and 2) I need to stay out of the sun!  I have finally found a product that can give me the most natural looking tan without the harmful effects of the sun.  The Moroccan Mineral Dark Self Tanning lotion has become part of weekly regiment, and since I&#x27;ve started using it, I can&#x27;t imagine living with out! Or wouldn&#x27;t want to for that matter... :-)</li>
    <li> Amazing color, it will however have a little streaking if you don&#x27;t wait till its dry, after I apply I put on baby powder so it dries faster , the results are fantastic. Deep brown tan when used every other day. I wish the bottle was bigger. I have very fair skin and I go through this like wildfire.</li>
    <li> I first would like to say that I have VERY fair skin - white, in the dead of winter.  I have had a difficult time finding a tanner that (1) didn&#x27;t streak, (2) didn&#x27;t have an orange undertone, and (3) didn&#x27;t require every-day applications.  When I first saw the results I was thrilled, but still wanted a second opinion.  I met up with my mother and she said, \\&quot;Oh my God, I&#x27;ve never seen you so tan!\\&quot;  I asked her if it looked natural and she said &#x27;yes, definitely.\\&quot;      Trust me, my mother would certainly tell me if it didn&#x27;t!    I saw an old friend later today and he asked if I had been on vacation.  I had to laugh because of the name of the product: \\&quot;extended vacation.\\&quot;  I promise you, even if you have super fair skin, this tanner is worth every cent.  I just wish I had found it sooner!      The only con is the application.  You have to wear gloves and you need to take a little time.  I also needed help with my back, so make sure you have someone handy!  But since this tan lasts, it&#x27;s worth the extra effort.</li>
    <li> I have pale skin that doesn&#x27;t tan so I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years.  I decided to try this and I&#x27;m really happy with it.  You need to make sure you put gloves on and it takes (I think) a lot longer to dry -- but I got the brownest and most natural tan I&#x27;ve ever had and it&#x27;s lasted almost a week now, fading evenly without that yellowy/nasty look I&#x27;d gotten with some others. Really glad I discovered this.</li>
    <li> Waist of money, the product is really expensive and is the worst taining soliton I have been tryed.</li>
    <li> Pros: The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as some other self tanners and it doesn&#x27;t seem to streak.  I like their self tanning lotion for your face as well.     Cons: I had to apply the lotion several times before I had a dark color and I need to reapply every few days. Because I have to use it so often, it can get costly but it&#x27;s still cheaper than spray tanning.  Even though I let it dry throughly, it stains my white sheets.</li>
    <li> Best self tanner I have found!</li>
    <li> First off I was very excited when I made the decision to purchase the \\&quot;Extended Vacation Moroccan Tanning Lotion...\\&quot; I have a natural olive skin undertones and figured this stuff would make me look amazing :). I am a model and am frequently out doing promotions and need to maintain a base tan. I no longer tan in tanning beds and was using a different self tanner which made me orange.    The day I decieded to try the Moroccan Tanner I exfoliated and cleaned my skin. I applied the self tanner as instructed and went to sleep. I woke up in the morning and showered it off, to my suprise it was all blended evenly. However I am no dark tan, I am a light tan if that. It says you dont need to apply it more than once to get a dark moroccan tan...I think I will need to apply it again tonight and see if I am darker tomorrow.     I am a little dissapointed because I paid more than I would for self tanner and it wasnt amazing like its supposed to be. My facialist said its probably because I have small pores and it didnt penetrate deep into my skin like it normally would for other girls. She uses this stuff and loves it!     For right now its ok and I like it, im just not as dark as the pictures of the girls on the brochure!</li>
    <li> Great product! The color looks more natural than any other self tanners I have tried. It can feel a little \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; so it&#x27;s best to put it on at night before you go to bed, letting it dry first, of course. I&#x27;ve even used it on my face, using a make up sponge to apply. It&#x27;s a good idea to shower the next morning to even out the color as it tends to be darker in some areas. I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at this product, particularly since I know quite a bit about skin cancers and the effects of the sun.  My wife had been lamenting the fact that she can&#x27;t go to the beach and get a tan due to her fair skin and the chance of skin cancer.  She tried all sorts of fake tanning with no real success--orange and smelly was no way to go through life!  However, when she  used this product, it actually gave her what looked like a real tan with no smell.  While I admit that I do not particularly care whether she is pale or tan, she does--and this one seems to work.</li>
    <li> Works better than a lot of others I have tried.  Will try the same product made for the face next summer.  Long lasting!</li>

    <li> I have tried and used many self tanners and I can honestly state that this particular self tanner is the best! It gives me a Natural Sun Kissed appearance! No fake orangey skin here ! It does have a slight oder but not intolerable! I do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> for $30 i am angry!!!!!! it left me streaky blotchy and had to use it every other day. i still have half the bottle left cuz i bought  another brand. and if i could return it I would!!!! HOTRRIBLE!!!</li>
    <li> So like everyone else Ive tried tons of self tanners and am looking for the perfect one.  I was so excited to try this one and bought it here is my results.. pros smell is gone after shower last for 2 weeks and sheds off evenly didnt get those patchy spots everywhere.  Cons turned my pale skin orange for the first week didnt look natural until the second week maybe was to dark for my light skin not sure but would be great product if they made it in a lighter formula...</li>
    <li> Not a good tanning lotion,its says it won&#x27;t turn you orange,oh yes it will,if you have any scares,they will look BROWN!!,and show up VERY well,Its a wast of money!! oh,yea..and broke out my face</li>
    <li> I emailed the company to get a list of the ingredients because I could not find them online anywhere.     Unfortunately, this product is full of toxins. Here is the list the rep emailed me.       Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Dihydroxyacetone, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Erythrulose, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Galactoarabinan, Sodium PCA, Betaine, Sorbitol, Glycine, Alanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Arginine, Lysine, Glutamic Acid, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 80, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Citric Acid, Parfum (Fragrance), Caramel, Mica, Titanium Dioxide.    That is, count &#x27;em, 5 parabens!!! I have never seen 5 different types of parabens in ANYTHING before. So Sad!    I have not tried the product so I cannot tell you if it works well, but I know that there are others out there that are far less toxic that (from the reviews) work better!</li>
    <li> If your goal is to look like a pumpkin then this lotion will be great for you!  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because there are so many fake reviews these days (positive &amp; negative) I never know what to believe.... I figure a lot of you are in the same boat as me and tend to target the 3 star reviews.  Anyway, if a lotion gives you an orange tint you cannot use it.... so after one use I&#x27;ll never use it again.  Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I got the wrong shade, but it turned my skin a most abnormal color.  And when I think back of the woman who suggested I get it, she looked like she overtanned in a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Not the beautiful golden tan as pictured.  Skin looks orange.  Does have a nice smell.  Unable to return.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This self tanner is my new favorite!!! I used to use St. Tropez self tanner but this one smells great and looks like a nice, natural dark tan. I do need to put it on twice though due to the fact my skin is rather pale. I would recommend this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I would never recommend this to anybody.  Horrible uneven,  streaky mess that takes days to come off and comes off on everything....</li>
    <li> I have been ordering / using a lot of different Self Tanners as of late because I hate suffering in the hot sun :)&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t want to look 80 when I turn 50 here soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the stuff I have on hand: Body Drench QuickTan, Tan Physics, St. Tropez, Tan Towels, Ever Glow by Ocean Potion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have found that I keep going to this particular tanner because it gives my skin a glow that the others don&#x27;t like where I have some freckles on my chest they aren&#x27;t so pronounced and my face, arms and legs kind of have a glow  (maybe it&#x27;s the mineral part?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the one thing I CANNOT stand is the &amp;#34;monkey butt&amp;#34; smell you get from most self tanners after a couple of hours (I can&#x27;t stand the way I start to smell) and this stuff does not (as far as I can tell) render that odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after last night&#x27;s application I realized I am getting to the bottom of my bottle (lasted me about 8 applications) and I kind of started to panic that it was low even though I have a closet full of  the others I could use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I reordered this today, along with, the facial tanner  (Moroccan Mineral Facial Tanner by Extended Vacation) because right now I really do like this product the best.</li>
    <li> Finally a self-tanning lotion that allows you to have this really nice tan without looking like you applied one of those self-tanning lotions. Other lotions I have tried so far indeed resulted in somewhat of a tan but never quite the dark and natural tanned look that you come home with from your week on the beach in the Caribbean. I love this one, I applied it about a week ago and today I still look like I just got off the plane from Aruba.  Love it !!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hype, that&#x27;s what it is. I&#x27;ve used a ton of self-tanning products in the past...and I know this isn&#x27;t a gradual tanner, but I tried it anyway. I&#x27;m usually careful about how to apply self-tanners. I wasn&#x27;t too bothered with the tint, but the long wait was annoying. And even so...I ended up with some streaks. Try not to get to sucked away by the &#x27;raving reviews&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Goes on with a tint so you can see where you&#x27;re applying product. Does not have a funny smell like most products. Leaves skin smooth. Some color washes off in water. I am over all pleased with this product, and have tried many other sprays, creams etc.</li>
    <li> The results of this are every bit as good as Prrty Potion, for about half the price, last time I checked. I am fair skinned and blonde, and it looks like I spent 2 weeks at Palm Beach. Smells good and stays for days.</li>
    <li> I am already quite tan, but this enhances the appearance with a great shade.  It lasts about four to five days.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I am very fair skinned and have tried many self tanning products over the years.  I have finally found the one I will stick with!!  I have a very natural looking tan!  All my friends are amazed that this natural looking glow is the result of a self tanner.  I am truly impressed with this product.  It is easy to use and gives amazing results!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that I spent this much money on this self tanner. My results were as vague and barely noticeable as cheap drugstore brands like Loreal and Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice however, but that does not justify the pricing on this one.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of self-tanners. I am very fair so any mistake shows up really bad. I have used Sun Labs and Lorac. They are some of the better ones I have used but I now have a new favorite. This moroccan Mineral Dark Tan is the best I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TY</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning product on the market, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of them. Absolutely no funky smell or odor, the color is phenomenal (not fake or orange), and 1 bottle can last me half a season. Words of advice...I put aloe gel on my face to \\&quot;thin\\&quot;out the lotion when applying to my face, and be careful putting this product on your feet. Feet need to be completely buffed and smooth first. This product rocks!</li>
    <li> Normally I would not spend $30 for a self-tanner or any beauty product for that matter. I always try to find deals. However, I haven&#x27;t found any other self tanner like this. I love the color and you don&#x27;t have to wear gloves to apply it as long as you wash your hands when you are finished. I actually love the color that it gives you right away when you put it on. That&#x27;s what I actually use it for.</li>
    <li> Nice dark real looking bottle tan! I did not wear gloves the 1st time I applied it. Big mistake! Other than that I love the product and woul reccomend to others.</li>
    <li> This did not turn out dark on me, even after multiple days of use. Plus it was expensive and non-refundable. I was disappointed. Maybe fine for someone who wants a light/medium tan but not for a dark tan.</li>
    <li> After years of searching for a self tanner, i finally&lt;br /&gt;the one! I was skeptical at first but after reading all the reviews i purchased it. Years of sunworshipping has left my skin with sun spots and i just cant tolerate the sun any longer as i used to in my younger years.&lt;br /&gt;Upon the first application i freaked out because it looked as though i rolled in the mud, but after the 6 hour wait as instructed, i showered and it became this gorgeous golden brown!! I couldnt believe it! I am very fair skinned, blue eyes and blonde hair. It looked fantastic and realistic!!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone commented on how great snd healthy i looked.&lt;br /&gt;Only advice would to be apply lotion to the creases such as elbows,feet,etc BEFORE applying tanner! I didnt do this first time and had a little discoloration but second application, i used lotion first in those areas and it turned out perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Very messy so use gloves or have a soap wuth a gritty texture to wash hands because it will stain.&lt;br /&gt;It also dries very quickly, about 15 minutes. I would apply at night and wake up and shower. Just wish the bottle was larger but definitely worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> This self tanner worked well for me.  I am a brown skin african american with vitiligo.  It really tones down my white patches.  It is not a complete match but works well after a cpople of allications.  The only down side i can see is that there is no immediate fix.  I have to let it take over night.</li>
    <li> I have researched and researched to find the best lotion and came across this one.  I read all the reviews and what was in the product and decided to try it.  I am a massage therapist and I have been testing this product out on a couple clients and I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it.  I used it on fair skin 1 treatment.  The client has been in touch with me and it has been 7 days.  The color is just now fading naturally.  NO STREAKS AND NO ORANGE COLOR AND NO YUCKY SMELL!!!  Those are the things that I looked for when researching.  On my second client I just did yesterday no streaking and no orange color.  I actually put a second layer on her.  She wanted a bit more coverage and so far so good.  That even worked.  I am extremely excited and pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Only kind I use!</li>
    <li> over twenty years of buying self tanners this was way overpriced for the quality and the small amount you receive. It doesn&#x27;t look like you have a great tan unless you reapply it everyday and no it doesn&#x27;t last for a week and yes it clogs your pores in your face.</li>
    <li> I was absolutely surgical with my prep/ application of this and the results were really disappointing.  Uneven, smelly the next day (great when applying, though!), barely noticeable except in splotches.  I use their face tanner and absolutely love it so I had high expectations for this one but no.  Not a winner.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Extended Vacation products as I use the Tan Refreshment and the Moroccan minerals facial tanners which I will use for the rest of my life! I wanted to try this because I have been using Nature&#x27;s Gate for a while and I do love that one too (the Medium Glow) but the pump bottle it comes in is a little annoying. I end up leaving so much product inside the bottle. The Extended vacation bottles/dispensers are just much better overall which is really key considering how much I spend on self tanning all year long.&lt;br /&gt;My secret with this is that I mix it with the Tan Refreshment. I was a little freaked out at first by the dark brown color so didnt want to apply directly - also I do not have time to sit around and then only wear dark loose fitting clothing all day, so I figured if I diluted it it would be better and it is! Warning - you will not be as tan as you would if you didnt dilute, but this is a better solution for me - i still wait 15 minutes but then just get dressed for work in whatever i was planning to wear. It is a much more gradual tan and I while I love the smell of the other EV products, this smell is better and amazing. I do wish that EV made this lotion in a medium tone and then I maybe would not have to mix it. I am 39 yrs old and have medium tone skin.</li>
    <li> It was ok. color wasnt as dark as Id like and the smell is good. not enough product for your money -</li>
    <li> Great stuff :) Nice dark color the first time you use it. Brown when you put it on, shower 6 hrs later, tan still there, lotion gone. no streaks and no orange :) Works great on face too!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunless tanner I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t stink like all the other sunless tanners. My advice for the perfect tan with this product is to take a shower and exfoliate well. Once you&#x27;re out of the shower, put a light layer of lotion on your feet, knees, elbows and wrists and wait for 10 to 15 minutes to make sure you are really dry. Once your skin is dry, don&#x27;t use too much of the product. It can be a bit streaky when you rub it in, but once you shower later, that all washes off and leaves a streak free tan that does not look orange. People have told me that I look really tan after I have used this. I have used almost a whole bottle of it at this point and am almost ready to buy more. It&#x27;s the first sunless tanner I will actually buy more of. It&#x27;s a great product for the price. The only reason that it&#x27;s not a five star review is because once you use it, you have to wait at least 6 hours before showering which can be a bit of pain as well as the bottle is kind of small. But still a great product for those of you looking for the perfect sunless tan.</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazingly !!!!! Put it on last night for an event today and WOW. People have been asking me all day where I went away on vacation!!! I love this stuff</li>
    <li> If your looking to get a self tanner, do not purchase this. It is extremely hard to rub in, and very clumpy. It definitely leaves a lot of streaks and I wasted about an hour of my time trying to run this in, and wasted my money. I ended up jumping in the shower and scrubbing this off the moment it was all the way on. Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;  You would be better off getting a spray tan or a different self tan lotion. Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer of this product. I have been using it for 4 years &amp; always get compliments on my beautiful tan.</li>
    <li> I was so exciting to receive this tanner after reading all the positive reviews, but it did NOTHING. I put it on last night at 8pm, it is now 9am the next morning, and there is absolutely no change. I have used many, many self tanners and even the $8.00 ones at CVS work much better than this. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective bottle, or what? But im rly pissed I wasted almost $30.00 on this. I&#x27;m just going to go back to getting airbrush tans.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been great! I am currently 4 months prego and wanted something for my olive skin so I can be more tan looking.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a few different ones but this one seems to work best for my skin tone. I am Italian/Korean so I have olive skin but it looks yellowish if Im not in the sun. This is perfect for that!!</li>
    <li> I like it I use it quite often.</li>
