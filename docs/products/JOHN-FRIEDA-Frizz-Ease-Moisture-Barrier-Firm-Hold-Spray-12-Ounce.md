      <li>I love it, works great!</li>
      <li>It also has a very nice scent to it, so you&#x27;re hair will smell good also.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant fragrance and it&#x27;s too rigid.</li>
      <li>best hairspray - does not have strong fragrance</li>
      <li>Good hairspray.</li>
      <li>I have loved every John Frieda product I have used.</li>
      <li>Good for the price</li>
      <li>Does not work good at all.&lt;br /&gt;Aqua</li>
      <li>I know of three really good products:  </li>
      <li>, silver and teal can by Suave “4x Mega” does not work good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This does really good job of holding my hair when styled.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any hairspray residue on my hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush through it with a good amount of spray in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it brings alot of product so thats good.</li>
      <li>I know of two good styling products:  Living Proof&#x27;s Texture Mist and Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s</li>
      <li>This also works good after straightening your hair.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s probably good hair spray for updos, but not for every day.</li>
      <li>I have tried many many hairsprays and I believe this is the best one.  </li>
      <li>It is perfect for an updo or slicked back hair, but is not the best choice for maintaining curls on a humid day.</li>
      <li>Has a nice pleasant scent that I can smell for a 30 minutes after using it</li>
      <li>The spray head is great, too; it&#x27;s not the flimsy spray&#x3D;paint type but an almost low-profile style that&#x27;s very secure.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Kinda worked. Kinda didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried sooo many hairsprays and had so-so results, but Frizz Ease works wonderfully every time.  It reduces frizz and holds styles.  I have naturally extremely straight hair -- but if I curl my hair and use this, not only do the curls last, but so does the body.</li>
    <li> I have tried hundreds of different hairsprays and this one blows the rest of them out of the water; and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does work great...but it has a rather bizarre smells...kind of like Scotch tape or Band-aid smell.</li>
    <li> I love it. it is the best hairspray i ever had.</li>
    <li> John Frieda Frizz-Ease Moisture Barrier Protector Hairspray is advertised as creating a barrier to help seal out moisture and prevent frizzing even in high humidity climates.  It is a product of the John Frieda Corporation and is quite reasonably priced.  Frieda was at one time a famous, award winning hairdresser who was inspired to found a self-named beauty products corporation.  The corporation that bears his name has become a major player in the hair products world, after making a good reputation for itself in the areas of color enhancement and frizz prevention products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, we have long hot humid summers here in Wilmington, North Carolina, my home. And my hair is naturally curly with a tendency to frizz.  So of course I&#x27;m always looking for products that will enhance my efforts in this line: frankly, am not as adept as I might be in dealing with hair.  Have found, over the years, frustratingly enough that whereas a good hairdresser blowout that allows for my curls and waves  may well look very pretty and last for up to a week, or even more, when I do my own hair, even with mousse or some kind of hair product, and leave it curly, it seldom lasts even overnight.  And that&#x27;s now with the long overdue acquisition of silk pillowcases that do help my hair-dos  last longer.  So, in my latest efforts to figure this problem out, have bought several John Frieda products, including this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer states that this product offers a quick drying shine boosting formula that also contains sunscreen, plus firm holding power that supports even the hardest to handle  styles all day long.  I have followed the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions in using this product, and do find that this spray has a certain amount of holding power, but I was not really happy with its retention of my curls the way they look best, or the product&#x27;s prevention of frizz.  For me, the hunt goes on for helpful products to keep my hair looking its best.</li>
    <li> i tried tresemmes version of this hairspray and hated it, it made my hair hard as a rock, alcohol smelling, dryed out, tangled, and didn&#x27;t hold any style for more than 2 hours, but when I used this one my style lasts all day with no annoying weird feeling :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!!! My hair looks fuller and maintains curls without going frizzy. Used to use professional products that cost 3-4 times the price of this one such as BigSexyHair. Purchase it, you will love it.</li>
    <li> The feel of this product on my hair took me back to the 80&#x27;s &amp; the days of Aquanet &amp; stiff  hair. It does have good hold, but you have to use just the right amount any overage &amp; you get the aquanet effect. I&#x27;m keeping it for those occasions when I don&#x27;t want my hair to move at all; definitely not for every day use for me.</li>
    <li> When sprayed on hair, your hair stays!  It has a pleasant fragrance and it&#x27;s too rigid.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great without flaking.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel sticky, and my hair still frizzed badly on a humid day when using this after the curling iron.</li>
    <li> I have to say the Frizz Ease line of products have been a dream for me!! I have only been using it for about a week now, but I get complimented all the time and I feel great after doing my hair!! It looks great after styling with less time spent on it than before! I used to spend a long time trying to tame my hair and now I just shampoo like normal, use the serum when its wet, style it, then rub some of the smoothing creme on and spray with frizz ease hairspray to lock in the AWESOME :) I spend WAY less time on my hair now and it looks WAY better and stays beautiful ALL day, no matter the weather!! I use the whole line though. I think its amazing and will continue to use it and recommend it! Like the other customer review, Id give it more stars if I could :)</li>
    <li> The Frizz Ease hairspray has a pretty decent hold that last most of the day. Con the other hand it does not do much for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Sprays out a coarse jet of sticky gel that gets my hair all wet and tangled up. After it dries up my hair feels like straws.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s because the nozzle is terrible that it feels like a hose-full of goo on my hair.</li>
    <li> This does really good job of holding my hair when styled.</li>
    <li> I have really frizzy hair, especially in the summer months. I just spray some of this on and they disappear! The only downside is if you spray too long or close in one area your hair will get a little crispy. Just move quickly and keep the can further away from your head to avoid that.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I couldn&#x27;t find my old brand...and YAY!! I am LOVING Frizz Ease! LOL! It does exactly what it says it will do and without stickiness or get-your-comb-stuck stiffness! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Best over the counter product. I am a professional hair stylist of over 30 yrs, so I&#x27;ve tried many products, comp to any professional product for about 1/2 the price.</li>
    <li> I have hair like Monica on Friends when they went to Barbados and this hair spray is my little secret to happy hair.  It is really does block humidity. I love it.</li>
    <li> My hair gets wild in the humidity and is usually unmanageable in the summers. I used this (on its own) on damp hair today and let it air dry - it let my hair dry curly but not frizzy and wild! So far I love it!</li>
    <li> best hairspray - does not have strong fragrance</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s broken and we have to return it.</li>
    <li> Perfect hair spray for humid southwest Florida</li>
    <li> I thought this was too stiff feelings. Perhaps a lighter touch would have been better.</li>
    <li> My kid loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Best product for fine hair!</li>
    <li> Very sticky and stiff. Not good for my thin hair as it&#x27;s hard to comb out. Drys very fast and is definitely a firm hold.</li>
    <li> Great hold!. It&#x27;s a little stiff if you don&#x27;t brush through it, but I&#x27;ve quickly gotten used to it. Hold me curls more more than 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Nice and really holds with not.to much bright</li>
    <li> Best price!  Holds hair perfectly.  When they arrive, the tops and spray buttons are usually scattered around the box.  I wish Amazon would pack them better.</li>
    <li> The only hairspray that I use now for my frizz-prone curly hair.  Will have to get used to the new brand look.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and works great!</li>
    <li> Plentiful Cheap and holds like a train on rails.&lt;br /&gt;Hair Type:  I have very fine soft Asian hair about 4-5 in long on top.  Normally sticks out like straight like a broom until I hit it with a flat iron to give it some texture and curl.  After that I either use the Grey Gatsby moving rubber or styling clay.  Then i finish it off this this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to walk 10 minutes down a hill everyday to work.  That hill features non-stop gale force gust and fog as thick as a swamp usually.  (ok that is dramatic but it&#x27;s really windy and foggy). This stuff keeps my hair from being blown to bits by the time I get to the train.  Other hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried leave me looking like I walked out of a Tesla coil.  This stuff is great.  Only con is running your hands through your hair will cause it to flake, so I just don&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this hairspray, but it ended up to be extremely standard, filled up with too much alcohol (I can smell the amount of alcohol as I spray it on my hair). It also leaves my hair dry and withered instead of shiny and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally wavy, frizzy, and fine in texture. This might work for other hair types, but didnt amaze me.&lt;br /&gt;Another downside is that the sprayer is a bit too strong, so I get too much product deposited on my hair, leaving it looking wet and saturated. I wish that the nozzle sprayed in a more fine mist that fell over the top of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I must add that the holding power is medium to strong. I think that it would be great for short hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;The moisture barrier claim confuses me. I don&#x27;t think that this hairspray is capable of blocking against humidity.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I have had better results with hairspray that cost $2.</li>
    <li> The scent is great--fresh, not smell like fragrance, but it definitely harden the hair. Love the price though.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray. Has a HUGE amount hold while also not leaving my hair looking like it&#x27;s wet. It does really seem to help cut down on frizz as well. I buy the tiny canister in travel sections so that I always have it on hand.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, but leaves gross residue if you try to brush it out.</li>
    <li> Living in Florida... humidity is often an issue for hair styles. This spray is perfect for this purpose. It has strong hold while not making your hair hard. It does not get &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; or flake as a general rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time I saw that occur was when I had WAY TOO much on but it was for a Halloween costume and I got sprayed with a squirt gun in the face and head. So... that was to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Dally use and touch-ups throughout the day, it will work well without showing build up. I only use this spray in humid climates.</li>
    <li> Comes out unevenly and it&#x27;s sticky. I think it&#x27;s probably good hair spray for updos, but not for every day.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I haven&#x27;t used anything else for the last 5 years. I can&#x27;t stand what the humidity does to my hair and this product keeps my hair smooth. But this is a firm hairspray so if you are not a fan of strong holding sprays this is probably not the product for you.</li>
    <li> This Hairspray is perfect for life on an island</li>
    <li> Extreme hold. Makes hair stiff and crunch if you hold it to close.  Do not need much to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;Usually use a workable spray while styling and then do a quick overall shot with this at the very end.&lt;br /&gt;Works well for backcombed areas that you don&#x27;t want to loosen.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  Never sticky &amp; I like the extra drying this product does to my hair as I am an oily/curly mophead.  This ,also, helps my hair stay straight when it is humid outside.</li>
    <li> The price was really good on this hair spray, much better than the local drug stores.  However, I was not happy with the packaging.  I ordered five cans and three of them had cracked plastic tops on them when they arrived.  It looks like whoever packed the box just threw them in and sealed the box.  Luckily, I tested each can and they seem to work ok.</li>
    <li> It has a decent hold but it leaves a residue that is sometimes visible on my hair which just makes me feel eh about it...I&#x27;ll use it for my daughter&#x27;s hair when she&#x27;s on stage but as for daily/everyday use, I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> everything works perfect... Great product</li>
    <li> I bought this hairspray because I read in a magazine that it holds well but does not make hair stiff.  I find that it is an okay hold and if you overdo it on the spray then your hair does stiffen and stick together.  I would prefer something that held well but kept my hair looking natural.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  My hair is very stubborn, never wants to stay in place, always having flyaways, etc.  I spray a little of this hairspray and it holds all day long.  It smells pretty good also.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t make it through a humid Midwest summer without this!</li>
    <li> Works well, smells nice!</li>
    <li> Best spray!!! My hair stays in one place with couple of sprays. It doesnt luk shiny or oily. Smell absolutely nothing!! Will buy more in the future</li>
    <li> This stuff made my hair feel like straw.  Not only while you are using it, but after you wash it out, it leaves your hair very dry.  I threw it out.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray ever! It&#x27;s light but holds well! I have been using it for almost a year now and put it on my subscribe and save so I never run out!</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised at this great product and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Best anti-humidity hair spray.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on price and a recommendation by an online beauty blogger that I found.  I am by NO means a high maintenance hair person and I rarely spend time styling my hair.  I have naturally thick curly hair so when I take the time to straighten it, I want to stay nice.  This is the only hair spray I own and I would say it is a great go to.  I dries very quick, keeps a firm hold, tames most of the frizzies and only gets a very tiny bit crunchy after loading it on.  Great for up-do&#x27;s or on teased areas.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!!! Great hold and perfect for keeping waves! Really enjoy this product and would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> Just as expected. This is a firm hold spray and you can even get medium length hair to stand straight up.</li>
    <li> ok this is 10 degrees in humid TX  What would be perfect?</li>
    <li> Great for hot humid days of summer. Scent is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Apply once in the morning and you have great looking hair all day. Hair stays perfectly in place, but does not look stiff at all</li>
    <li> fantastic hair spray. hair stays soft.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and I could not live without this hairspray. It is by far my favorite that I&#x27;ve used in a long time, even replacing the expensive salon brand I was using!</li>
    <li> For how much you get for the price it&#x27;s an amazing deal you get a huge bottle but you do need to use slightly more than other brands because it doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a hold as some other hairsprays but I don&#x27;t mind it at all I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a hair spray that would truly keep my hair in place and slightly &amp;#34;poofed up&amp;#34;...this is that hair spray...I spray with short, quick sprays, so as not to over power...and by doing that don&#x27;t get that lacquered feel...my hair stays both up and in place...I&#x27;ll stick to this make and type (Frizz-Ease) as long as they produce it...</li>
    <li> The John Frieda Frizz Ease Firm Hold is among the very best hair spays at any price point. John Frieda products continue to earn numerous good reviews from reliable sources such as Allure Magazine, and this particular product earns high marks on numerous shopping sites such as target, walmart, and drugstore dot com. It goes on in a fine mist, lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t flake and has outstanding moisture protection and a decent scent. If your hair is prone to curl in high humidity this is one of the best products out there.  A minus is the nozzle has to have frequent cleaning (water is fine)  or the normally excellent fine mist becomes somewhat less fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that it is available at the time of this review with free shipping at target for 4.35 which is much cheaper than the amazon price. In addition this is being advertized as having prime shipping but amazon is giving discount slow shipping, not 2 day free prime shipping. This is clearly wrong as people have paid for prime shipping and are receiving 3-5 day discount shipping-not what they paid for. Recommendation for today is to buy it cheaper elsewhere. Target will give you discount shipping also, but at least they are much cheaper and don&#x27;t advertize something that they aren&#x27;t giving you.</li>
    <li> very strong hold. Good for the price but I am not sure on how it damages the hair...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t style my hair (just brush it straight because that&#x27;s easier), but I have a terrible time with frizz.  My hair is dry and chemically-treated so I have a lot of little hairs near my part (which is in the middle) that stick up.  I don&#x27;t like that, so I decided to find a product to help keep those down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray is pretty good at getting those flyaways to stay flat against my head.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and it dries pretty quickly.  Since I&#x27;m not using a lot at once, the can (which is huge) will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does make the areas where I spray it a little crusty-feeling. You can&#x27;t tell by looking, but you can feel it.  It&#x27;s not a big deal because I keep this on the top of my head around the part, but it&#x27;s just something to keep in mind.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is not for the faint of heart.  It shoots out of the nozzle like a fire hydrant, very concentrated instead of a wide spray.  If you need super hold, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My daughter has very curly hair and we live in Florida where there is high humidity. This really helps control her hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used hairspray before, but recently I decide to try it and see if it would help hold my curls in. I have naturally straight-ish hair with a little bit of a wave to it, but I&#x27;ve never been able to keep curls in for more than a few hours. So I bought a small travel size can of Frizz Ease at Walmart, gave my side bangs a bit of curl and sprayed. The curl froze and didn&#x27;t move for the next 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, my sisters all hate this hair spray, they say it makes my hair crispy, and I agree with them. The smell gives me headaches and I keep spraying myself in the eye with it. It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;mist\\&quot; like other people say hairspray ought to do either. It holds VERY well, too well if you ask me. I am now on the lookout for a \\&quot;pliable\\&quot; hairspray that won&#x27;t make me feel like I just slathered glue all over my head. But if I ever need a super duper strong hair glue, you can be sure this will be at the top of my list. :)</li>
    <li> Firm hold, but not too sticky.  Have naturally curly hair that I usually straighten a bit and this def helps in high humidity</li>
    <li> This product works for my purposes, as have other Frieda products.</li>
    <li> Generally lightweight hold.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Great product and works well</li>
    <li> I use this hairspray every day.  It&#x27;s not real sticky, yet holds really well.  Also it does&#x27;t have a terrible, loud smell that some hairsprays a do.</li>
    <li> Great hair spray...will buy more.</li>
    <li> This spray works great for me.  Has it been discontinued?</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an add-on item and am glad that I did.  I&#x27;ve used another brand for years but it has never held up to the humidity we have here.  John Frieda Frizz Ease Moisture Barrier has definitely solved the problem.  A very light spray and my hair stays in place and seems to have more volume.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is easily weighed down. I have tried a variety of hairsprays over the years, every one of them claimed to create volume or not weigh fine hair down, and although my hair always looked okay right after applying, I would come back later only to find my hair WAS weighed down...an almost \\&quot;oily,\\&quot; limpish look. Happily, this hairspray does not have that affect on my hair, and as an added bonus it is one of the best smelling hairsprays I have ever tried.  I used to be of the opinion that all hairsprays stink...figured it must have been some necessary ingredient in the stuff to make it work, but this actually smells pretty darned good...for hairspray. :)</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray now for years. Helps keep hair in place. Love also the &amp;#34;Shine&amp;#34; made by John Frieda.</li>
    <li> I live in Houston and the humudity can be brutal at times. This hairspray keeps my hair in place and prevents the frizzies. I have loved every John Frieda product I have used. This hairspray is no exception ... and the price is great.</li>
    <li> the best hair spray ever. I love John Frieda products!!! awesome products awesome value, affordable.</li>
    <li> This is such a sensational product for the person with very fine hair.  You can not only set and hold, you can style by successive build applications.  For a nearly bald man like me, it is so great that I give cans to my barber (not stylist) of 25 years to use on me and others as well.  It will sustain its lift and hold throughout a day even in high winds, not falling with humidity or oil advance. When you apply it will not weigh down your fine hair at all.</li>
    <li> I cannot say that I would ever purchase this again.  It does not come out in a fine mist at all and it is not possible to dispense just a small squirt. I was shocked at how much residue was on my counter top from over spray and how I had to literally let water sit on it a bit to get it up, and wonder how this is going to be washing out of hair, without leaving some behind and building up. So, if you are looking for dense, hard hold, this one is for you. I am sticking with Sebastian Shaper Plus.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairspray initially because it was inexpensive, but it actually came to be one of my favorite products! I am pretty picky with hairspray and I&#x27;ve tried higher and lower-end products that didn&#x27;t work as well as this stuff does. The smell is nice (a nice, light, and not overpowering scent), and it still holds my hair in place when I brush through it. I am not one of those people who can let hairspray sit in my hair and feel hard and unnatural - I have to brush through it! Luckily, this hairspray allows me to do that with ease. It doesn&#x27;t leave any hairspray residue on my hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush through it with a good amount of spray in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I knocked off one star is because it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Frizz Ease&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t think my hair looks as smooth as it could. It&#x27;s not really noticeable to anyone else, but for my standards I prefer a little more polished of a look so I&#x27;m thinking of adding a finishing creme to my routine to combat that.</li>
    <li> leaves hair with some resistance to humidity while not being too stiff or weighty on my baby fine but slightly kinky hair.....once styled, I spray a little on my hair, let it dry...then comb to a &#x27;finished look&#x27; and then spray a little bit more.</li>
    <li> it brings alot of product so thats good. but when its spayed too much is released at once</li>
    <li> Maintains the moisture of my hair for 8 long hours! can you imagine that? All hair products I&#x27;ve tried before never gave an impressive result like this!</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray that I&#x27;ve found to work for my course and curly hair without becoming gummy in humidity but can still hold the style.  Of course, sometimes I spray too much and it becomes a bit stiff but I&#x27;ve found it becomes less so as the day goes on and by evening it just feels soft again.  I love this formula!</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best hairsprays I&#x27;ve ever tried. It works very well and keeps the curls curled for most of the day! It is a firm hold hairspray, so it can get your hair kind of crunchy and hard. HOWEVER, that&#x27;s only if you spray it directly on your hair. I reccommend spraying it at least 6 inches away from your hair if you want that lose vibe to your curls. If you want it to be stiffer, then spray it even closer. This also works good after straightening your hair. It also has a very nice scent to it, so you&#x27;re hair will smell good also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still learning to self style my hair and this does do the job. Just make sure u don&#x27;t spray too much or else it would make ur hair look crunchy, I&#x27;ll probably update this review (if I can) once I learn to style perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality hairspray and costs about a dollar less than in most local stores. Holds up well and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I can get my hair looking just like I want it for the first time in my life!  And it will stay and it doesn&#x27;t take much spray to do it.&lt;br /&gt;Like all new cans of spray, it puts out like a fire hose when you first start using it. But there is a solution.  I went to the auto parts store and got some tiny O rings that are the correct size to fit over the spray stem where it comes out of the can.  Put two of them over the stem, and put the spray nozzle back on.  It makes it much more controlable.  I can push gently and make the can put on an extremely fine mist that that doesn&#x27;t wet the hair.  And it drys in a few seconds.  Then put on just a little more the same way, and you are done.  If you fire hose it, it wets it and my hair will move out of place.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!!!</li>
    <li> I recommend this hairspray, it works really well, and I do notice less frizzy&#x27;s when I use it opposed to my other hairspray. it is a great product at a great price! it came before expected, packaged well, no problems with the seller, will buy from again....&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this to everyone, I believe it is a great product at a great price, and works very well!</li>
    <li> Can make your hair &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; if you use too much or for more than one day.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of stray hairs and I would usually spray some of this on my comb, then comb through my hair and it makes it look really smooth. I think it makes up-dos look way better.</li>
    <li> Does hold firmly.  The spray nozzle on the can I have seems to spray in a more concentrated stream than I&#x27;d like, but it works if I move the can around fast enough.</li>
    <li> Works great on my long curly hair</li>
    <li> I like it enough to use it. I feel like it makes my hair a little sticky, but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good price and definitely does the job of hair spray, but it does leave hair a bit stiffer and stickier than I like. Probably best for hair that has been styled and needs to really be held in place. I usually don&#x27;t style my hair and just want to tame flyaways, and this feels like a bit too much for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving four stars because it is great for when I curl or style my hair, as long as I kind of break up the stiffness.</li>
    <li> I like this hair spray. It smells good, holds well and last a long time. The cap doesn&#x27;t seem to get as closed up either like some other hairsprays do and then you have to clean it to get anything to come out of the nosel.</li>
    <li> I live in a moist area and am looking for a spray to help hold my hair style in a humid climate.  I found this to be a rather light hold.  I need something stronger.</li>
    <li> Well DUH if you think this is \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;.  If it wasn&#x27;t, it wouldn&#x27;t be firm hold... Just sayin&#x27;.  This truly is a firm hold hairspray - Not a firm hold wannabe.  If you have straight, thick hair, which needs firm hold hair to keep curls in, I greatly suggest this product!  And yes, also great for updos!</li>
    <li> A little too crunchy, but it does stand up to Deep South humidity.</li>
    <li> Just the right hold. My hair does not move but if you spray it on when the hair&#x27;s dry, it will look like you didn&#x27;t apply anything.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hairspray.  I was using many different salon brand hairsprays, but came across this by using the trial size for travel.  It works soooo well.  Keeps my hair in place, without creating any tangles from holding too strong.  Smells great, and works great.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> First of all, I was excited to try the hairspray as I live in a very his climate. The first time I tried it I put the usual amount on my hair, and my hair was super crunchy! Next time, I put way less and still had the same problem. Now, I&#x27;m not even using it. Beware! Not a fan!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.  Best spray around.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years and love that it&#x27;s on Subscribe &amp; Save.  Holds hair in place well without a sticky finish!</li>
    <li> I am fiercely brand-loyal to this hairspray. I credit it with allowing me to have \\&quot;long\\&quot; hair that holds a curl for the first time in life. (Note...to me, long hair is shoulder-length because of my thin, straight, baby-fine hair.) If the day is really humid or I get rained on, my hair will still go flat but for most weather, my hair holds its shape with this spray.&lt;br /&gt;Other sprays seemed to be \\&quot;wet\\&quot; and my hair would start to fall even as I sprayed it on! The Frieda spray seems \\&quot;dry\\&quot;, it is NOT crunchy...that other commenter must have been plastering it on! I know the spray was designed for curly girls who turn to frizz in humidity, but it seems to work just as well for people who have the opposite problem.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Use it every day!</li>
    <li> Good hairspray. Goes on nice, but a little goes a long way, so use sparingly or else it will crunch.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold like it say it do. But my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz up at all. I love it. Worth buying.</li>
    <li> I love the entire Frizz-ease line which is why I decided to pony up more than $0.99 for this stuff.  And I&#x27;m glad I did.  Unlike really cheap hairspray, this isn&#x27;t sticky or crusty to the touch, even after a light coat.  I use it more heavily on the sides, above my ears, to keep my &#x27;wings&#x27; in check because of my curly hair, and even that heavy application wasn&#x27;t really crusty so much as very secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy this again when I&#x27;m out, which may be a while since it&#x27;s a big can.  The spray head is great, too; it&#x27;s not the flimsy spray&#x3D;paint type but an almost low-profile style that&#x27;s very secure.</li>
    <li> I have tried many many hairsprays and I believe this is the best one.  I don&#x27;t know how it compares to something you pay $$$$ for from a salon, etc., but in comparison to other drugstore, reasonably priced hairsprays, this stuff really holds.  Yes, it does make it slightly stiff but I want it to stay in place so that&#x27;s ok with me.  It washes out very easily too.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. I live in TN and it gets quite humid in the very hot summer. This keeps my hair from going limp while keeping the shine. Love it.</li>
    <li> Frizz Ease is one of the brands I tried in my search for  hairspray that actually works.  I was looking for something to really actually HOLD my hair in place, and I thought the idea of reducing frizz was a bonus.  I&#x27;ll grant that out of the 4 that I tried that ended up on my &#x27;do not buy again&#x27; list, this was the best of the &#x27;bad&#x27; ones.  It did hold better than the 3 below, but still did not hold good and it did nothing for frizz.  I have naturally curly hair that likes to frizz, so I curl it when I go out, but this didn&#x27;t stop frizz at all.&lt;br /&gt; Here are my notes on the ones I compared it to:&lt;br /&gt;Tres Semme in black can:  Does not work good at all.&lt;br /&gt;Aqua Net white can “extra super hold”  does not work good.&lt;br /&gt;Rave, silver and teal can by Suave “4x Mega” does not work good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my search I discovered Salon Grafix Mega hold.  It is AMAZING.  A couple &#x27;normal&#x27;/light sprays and the SG holds my hair and bangs all day, outside, in the wind by the river.  I was floored that I actually found something that worked.  When I got home, every hair of my bangs was still in the exact same place I had sprayed it that morning.  I highly recommend the Salon Grafix.  Save yourself some time and money in the search for the 10 star hairspray and just buy the SG Brand.  I will never buy anything else.</li>
    <li> This hairspray does exactly what the label states. I went from Frizzy to smooth.</li>
    <li> I swear by this hair spray. I have tried various different brands over the years and this John Frieda Hair Spray is my favorite.  It holds all day (if you don&#x27;t touch your hair, that is) and give my hair alot of texture so it looks voluminous. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, not as strong as I had hoped, but not sure how strong other brands are either. Has a nice pleasant scent that I can smell for a 30 minutes after using it :) Its not overpowering. Grape Smell!</li>
    <li> This hair spray keeps out humidity and dries almost instantly. It&#x27;s the only thing that works with my hair. I would recommend it for anyone with straight hair who is trying to make it curl and keep it that way.</li>
    <li> My sister loaned me a bottle of this hairspray 12 years ago on the day of my wedding and I&#x27;ve never switched...it&#x27;s amazing! I have a short, styled haircut that required a VERY firm hold. This spray is like lacquer, it holds my thick hair in shape all day long. Now, you can&#x27;t run your hands through it, but I don&#x27;t care about that, I want hair that stays in place. I can be out in a misty rain or snow and it still holds...amazing!</li>
    <li> This hairspray works great, it is awesome to have to delivered to my front door and not fighting of any crowds.</li>
    <li> This product is defective!  You cannot fit the lid on the can without expressing some of the spray out. (It naturally sits lower than the top of the nozzle.) Also, judging by the buildup of spray on the outside of the can this happened a lot during shipping too.  Yet, despite this, there is NO mechanism to allow me to return it or get refund - because it is deemed a hazardous material??  I am not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> The spray doesn&#x27;t stay up for long. Guess the price is an indication.</li>
    <li> Ok if I could give this NO STARS I would! first time using this was yesterday. I have long black hair. First day of using it I really liked it. My hair stayed in place and didn&#x27;t budge. (What I was looking for) however when I woke up the second day I noticed my hair had A TON of WHITE residue in it. This never happens to me ever so it&#x27;s the hairspray that did it. It was gross!! So nasty! I can usually go 3 days without washing my hair but nope not today. This white stuff was all over where I sprayed the hairspray. I will give this one more shot. If it does it again then this will be a fail. Really wanted to love this stuff. So far not happening. I&#x27;ll report back tomorrow with an update.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my hair feel like plastic, it was beyond firm! If you&#x27;re looking for a very crunchy hair spray to make your hair super dense and stuck to itself like a single matted piece then look no further. The nozzle lets out too much spray at once making it impossible to just mist over your hair with a bit of spray to hold your style, which is what I was looking for. My hair looked very unnatural. Not for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product. My hair tend to become curly during hot summer but this spray is ideal to keep my hair in a nice shape</li>
    <li> Best price!  This is the best hair spray, it is not sticky!!!</li>
    <li> Works well for windy or rainy days to keep hair in place</li>
    <li> Really nice product, it doesn&#x27;t feel too sticky after use either.  It seems to hold up in humidity so far, and I find that the hold is really good.  The smell is great too, in case thats an issue.  I can still touch my hair after use and not worry that it looks wet or sticky.  So far, I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I am 53 yrs. old and I have used less than a dozen cans of hairspray.  I love this spray. It is a bit stiff but just run your fingers through it after it dries. I don&#x27;t mind styling my hair because I know it will hold. Southeast Louisiana is extremely humid and my hair does not frizz with this spray.!! It does keep humidity out. Love it!!</li>
    <li> This spray always leaves my hair crunchy. It is perfect for an updo or slicked back hair, but is not the best choice for maintaining curls on a humid day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! In the daily humid heat of florida it&#x27;s almost a magic bullet against unwanted curl and frizz. It holds all day, sleek and smooth hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I love it, works great!</li>
    <li> This is the best anti humidity hair spray I&#x27;ve putchased.  Terrific hold and really works on frizzy hair. I&#x27;m impressed.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to pick up so I cant leave a review but I did receive a refund.</li>
    <li> this is the crunchy stuff that won&#x27;t budge</li>
    <li> Great product and it arrived quickly*  No problems with the packaging either, I was afraid of it being dented or even exploding in transit, but no... I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> This hairspray definitely works.  It held my loose waves all night and they didn&#x27;t budge at all.  There wasn&#x27;t much humidity so I can&#x27;t say whether it works in all weather but I was definitely impressed with its performance.  It&#x27;s more of a firm hold product not a touchable invisible hold.  It smells a little funky but not really unpleasant.  It&#x27;s a fine mist and a light spray on top and underneath was all it took to keep my style in place.  For touchable hold I know of three really good products:  Nexxus Comb Thru, Toni and Guy, and Tresemme&#x27;s Perfectly Undone.  Nexxus provides the brushable touchable hold that is undetectable.  The same is true of Toni and Guy/  Perfectly Undone is from Tresemme&#x27;s runway collection and is totally unlike any of their other hairsprays, meaning, it works.  Any of these 3 products will give truly strong hold that will last all day and into the next.  If you need to redo on the second day, simply brush the hairspray out and recurl and then respray.  None of them buildup or flake, which is the true test.  All they all wash out without leaving a sticky residue.  And the hold is in no way stiff or forced looking.  I know of two good styling products:  Living Proof&#x27;s Texture Mist and Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Does It All spray.  Both of them work great when used with a curling iron and the waves have shape and definition.  They are both expensive, which is why I use less expensive hairspray.  When I first started styling my hair like I do now, I used the John Frieda hairspray, but since then I wanted a more natural looking style so I switched to different hairspray.  It&#x27;s possible that any of them could be used as a styling spray but I&#x27;ve yet to use them that way.  I highly recommend this hairspray if you want firm hold.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good.  It doesn&#x27;t build up and it is an ok smell.</li>
    <li> Ehhhh wasn&#x27;t too impressed. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray!!!  I live in the South where it is humid all the time. I have fine, frizzy hair and this hairspray does help keep it under control. I have to use it along with a heavy hold hairspray like Bed Head Hard Head. Since my hair is fine, it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well. I find that if I use this hairspray first and then the Bed Head, I can get my curls to last all day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really do a whole lot with my hair but am *trying* to get out of my mom-hair (aka pony tail) phase. I&#x27;ve never bought hairspray other than cheap stuff and Fructis (which is probably in the cheap stuff category?) and wanted to give something new a try. This has been a great product for use in the Florida humidity and has held up my simple hairstyles well. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong, unbearable odor and it hasn&#x27;t caused my hair to look dirty or crunchy. I plan to keep my subscription.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best hairspray for my curly hair. Trust me I have tried them all- expensive or not.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been lasting me a long time!</li>
    <li> I followed the spraying instructions, and this stuff still left my hair grayish looking..</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. My hair used to get blown all over the place in the least breeze. Not any longer. It even hold well in strong winds.</li>
    <li> Great product!  A light feeling spray that holds well!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only spray I&#x27;ll use. My hair is thick, but fine. Volume is always an issue. I finally figured out why this is so good -- unlike every other spray I&#x27;ve looked at, the first ingredient is NOT water. A light mist of this spray holds my hair even in humidity.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping - product as described.  Thanks</li>
    <li> So so works in a pinch but not the great spray made.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR HARD TO HOLD HAIR. MY HAIR IS THIN SO I NEED SOMETHING WITH EXTRA HOLD AND THIS DOES THE JOB.</li>
    <li> I live on the coast and have naturally wavy (frizzy) hair.  This is the only spray that helps me tame it, without flaky, sticky, residue.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells good</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I have fine and curly hair. As long as I don&#x27;t put this product on when my hair is wet I have no issues with it making my hair crunchy as other posters have noted. What I love about it is it&#x27;s ability to make my \\&quot;second day\\&quot; hair much easier to style. If I wash my hair, fix it and use this spray, then sleep on it, the next day my curls still have their shape, they don&#x27;t end up all flat and mangled like they do if I don&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s the difference between looking frumpy on the day after I wash my hair or still looking put together.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray.  It&#x27;s not heavy feeling and allows my hair to still move without being totally stiff. I usually buy it locally unless there is a coupon on amazon.  Not a overwhelming scent either.</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff. I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this spray.  It leaves my hair feeling crunchy and unmovable.  I don&#x27;t spray much but it makes my hair more in one big block if I don&#x27;t comb through it..</li>
