      <li>I find this very refreshing and i feel it works better than your typical visine-type products.</li>
      <li>a little they feel great.</li>
      <li>I called the actual company and spoke with the owner about their AMAZING Advantage drops and how it helped my respiratory problem I&#x27;ve had for three years, and I told him the Eyebright drops didn&#x27;t work after two days.</li>

      <li>I love natural products like this--</li>
      <li>For those with eye irritations, this product may be worth a try.</li>

      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>Will know more after further usage of the product.</li>
      <li>Really works!.</li>
      <li>When I asked about the symptoms after my healthy eye exam, he said it could&#x27;ve been anything such as allergy or seasonal irritation.</li>
      <li>first by using these drops, I then wipe away any discharge using pet eye wipes and then I administer his prescription ointment.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>when I got the conjunctivitis, but I am now starting to be able to read it without using my reading glasses.</li>
      <li>do feel more refreshed after the initial stings.</li>
      <li>Your Advantage, Eyebright drops and Momordica products I&#x27;ve tried REALLY work!</li>
      <li>Good Product, received in a few days, will order again.</li>
      <li>This has proven to be a good and more effective replacement for other more expensive over-the-counter and $300+ prescription Restasis in treating my very dry eye problem</li>
      <li>I have been battling dry eye syndrome for many years now.</li>
      <li>I just started to  use this product in allergy season when my eyes itch and smart.</li>
      <li>I bought this product based on the many positive reviews only to realize those reviews were most likely all fabricated.</li>
      <li>I found out MSM actually provides many eye benefits that you can easily google to research, as do other included ingredients Grapefruit Seed Extract and Apple Cider Vinegar (probably what causes the stings).</li>
      <li>They have really helped with the redness in my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I really did not see any benefit with these eye drops.</li>
      <li>I really like this eye drop</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It really burns</li>
      <li>So it didnt really do much for me.</li>
      <li>but the whole reason I&#x27;m putting in eye drops is for the soothing effect it will produce.</li>
      <li>Better than expected.</li>
      <li>and the pain was too much.</li>
      <li>does not heal floaters, been using for 6 months, very pricey for the results.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>but I experienced headaches due to being sensitive to the MSM (which I later found out was the cause of my headaches).</li>
      <li>It does help, but not any better than other eye drops in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Also, they sting more than any other eye drops I have ever used, including</li>
      <li>They get easily irritated and dry.  </li>
      <li>but it keeps my eyes clear and bright and even seems to help with my usual sinus issues.</li>
      <li>I do not know yet how it is working for my particular eye situation as I had hoped that I would experience a clearer vision after a fewer weeks of using the product.</li>
      <li>I am also using this (w/supplements) on my 2 Toy Poodles, as they are getting older</li>
      <li>Seems to do a better job than some of the more expensive ones sold otc.  </li>
      <li>These drops are all natural, and they really helped to soothe my itchy eyes while treating blepharitis.  </li>
      <li>As far as the bump, I don&#x27;t expect too much to change, but I will continue and keep you posted on the results.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a&lt;br /&gt;great natural product.</li>
      <li>Within hours of starting these drops, my eyes went from bright red to pink and the oozing went from copious to a trickle.  </li>
      <li>I have had sensitive eyes my whole life.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was recently diagnosed with conjunctivitis, and since the doctor determined it was viral, not bacterial, she couldn&#x27;t give me anything for it.  Within hours of starting these drops, my eyes went from bright red to pink and the oozing went from copious to a trickle.  I still can&#x27;t believe what I saw, but there&#x27;s no other explanation for it.  After a few days, I cut way back on using them, and the oozing immediately started up again.  Very impressive, and not at all what I expected.  Wow!</li>
    <li> does not heal floaters, been using for 6 months, very pricey for the results.</li>
    <li> Works but does sting a little.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and has been approved for use by my veterinarian. It has cleared up small eye infections completely before and keeps her eyes clean so that they run less (like cocker eyes seem to do).</li>
    <li> I use tis daily to help with my eyes....apple cider is supposed to help....this product has a slight sting but goes away in a couple of seconds....will continue using this product.....thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it might work for some but I experienced headaches due to being sensitive to the MSM (which I later found out was the cause of my headaches). So if you are sensitive to MSM you might want to reconsider.</li>
    <li> I liked this at first as it seemed to improve my vision when you first put it in and it does sting for a couple of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;However, after using it for a few weeks, there is no improvement in my eyes as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Stings a little bit. Only time will tell if it effective.</li>
    <li> Seemed nothing special.</li>
    <li> Just to let you guyz know that the astringent part that their saying is so great is actually bad for you because it only helps as long as you keep taking it. Once you don&#x27;t have them or stop using your condition with actually get worse</li>
    <li> I initially bought these for my cat  (who had a minor eye irritation, that was quickly resolved). After reading some comments, I decided to try them for myself, every nite. I find them very soothing, refreshing and I see clearer instantly. I am also using this (w/supplements) on my 2 Toy Poodles, as they are getting older and I want to prevent cataracts, if I can.</li>
    <li> Works great!! The burn for me is minimal.  Definitely not as bad as the burning in my eyes that lasts all day when I don&#x27;t use the drops. They have really helped with the redness in my eyes.  As a matter of fact, these drops seem to be the only thing that help. I have two pingueculi on each eye and while the drops have not made them go away - they are less visible.  I stopped using it for a week and I felt the difference.  I can just use a drop in each eye every morning and I am set for the rest of the day.  Not a miracle but the price is worth my comfort.</li>
    <li> These are the best eye drops ever! (and I seriously think I have tried every brand/type)</li>
    <li> I think I like it, but I&#x27;m a little scared to try it. I&#x27;ll get back to you on it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the eye drops.</li>
    <li> Bought for my cat with a clogged tear duct. worked great, and cleared my allergies up a bit too. thanks!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything but burn</li>
    <li> I suffer from very bad allergies each morning and I wake up with watery eyes. On some occasions my eyes are itchy and make my puffy eyes worse. I have been using Eyebright drops each day for about a week and I have noticed some relief. I would recommend these drops as a bandaid to underlying problems but I would would also recommend exploring a solution to the source of your problem. I invested in a room air filtration system and I hope it helps.</li>
    <li> I bought these to see if they would help with eye floaters, but they burn like there&#x27;s no tomorrow and only seem to irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> There is a little stinging after applying the eye drop.  The smell of vinegar is a bit strong too.  Other than that, I feel comfortable after application.</li>
    <li> helped my allergy red bloodshot eyes.</li>
    <li> For the first time in my life, I came down with conjunctivitis after cleaning out my reptile&#x27;s tank. I always wash my hands like 20 times a day because I have pets and it&#x27;s just a habit, but I must not have gotten something off. 24 hours later, almost instantly, my right eye got a disgusting goo over it and I couldn&#x27;t see out of it. I went to urgent care and they told me I had conjunctivitis. I was kind of horrified and felt like I was dirty or something. Anyway, the prescription they gave me took away the goo, but I had a continued layer of fog or something over my eye and I lost my close-up vision in that eye. This was horrible for me, as I work from home at my computer all the time. I found a review about this and a man shared his story that it cured his conjunctivitis. I was skeptical, but at this point, I had nothing at all to lose. I bought it and it burned like heck! I did it for two days and got no results, so I gave up. I called the actual company and spoke with the owner about their AMAZING Advantage drops and how it helped my respiratory problem I&#x27;ve had for three years, and I told him the Eyebright drops didn&#x27;t work after two days. He said, conjunctivitis is a tough one to treat. You must use it twice a day for one month and you will see results. Well, I&#x27;m so impatient, I was my own worst enemy. I started using it twice a day for one month. I&#x27;m not going to lie. It BURNS SO BADLY at times in both eyes that I don&#x27;t look forward to that part, but for 10 seconds of agony, I am now reaping the rewards of the icky stuff on my right eye being gone and I can work again at my PC and not walk away with headaches because I can&#x27;t see! It&#x27;s a miracle! I forgot to use my drops for about 5 days and it came back, so I know this is a lifetime treatment for me now. I couldn&#x27;t see my cell phone at all anymore when I got the conjunctivitis, but I am now starting to be able to read it without using my reading glasses. Not perfectly, but I can see it again. I think I have permanent damage and will need those glasses, but I don&#x27;t have to feel humiliated now and pick up my reading glasses outside just to read it, and it&#x27;s all because of these drops! Thank you, Wisdom of the Ages and this multi-generation family-owned business, for making all-natural products that WORK! God Bless. Your Advantage, Eyebright drops and Momordica products I&#x27;ve tried REALLY work!rmanent damage and will need those glasses, but I don&#x27;t have to feel humiliated now and pick up my reading glasses outside just to read it, and it&#x27;s all because of these drops! Thank you, Wisdom of the Ages and this multi-generation family-owned business, for making all-natural products that WORK! God Bless. Your Advantage, Eyebright drops and Momordica products I&#x27;ve tried REALLY work!</li>
    <li> Love it and use it every day. Didn&#x27;t have any eye problems to start thank God but it keeps my eyes clear and bright and even seems to help with my usual sinus issues. Loved it so much in fact that I ordered it for my mom too :)</li>
    <li> I love natural products like this--the eyebright herb is a favorite of mine.  Soothes the eyes; I recommend it to anyone who believes in natural products and wants something to soothe the eyes and is a natural!</li>
    <li> I tried others eye drops over the years, I used , clear eyes,visine, but this one is far better , because it WORKS!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great.  Keep it in the butter compartment of the fridge along with our other liquid herbs.</li>
    <li> It works, though it does burn if you open your eyes immediately after putting drops in your eyes.  If you keep your eyes closed for a few seconds after applying the drops, the burn decreases considerably.</li>
    <li> These drops work well to moisten and &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my little Shih Tzu&#x27;s eyes.  He is a puppy mill rescue and suffers from severe dry eye.  Every morning, afternoon and evening hid eyes are cleaned and treated: first by using these drops, I then wipe away any discharge using pet eye wipes and then I administer his prescription ointment.  He is under the care of a vet ophthalmologist and these drops meet her approval.</li>
    <li> I can see better without my glasses now. I still have to wear them due to my vision being blurry vision. stop using it for a few days now, it really stings(burn) and the pain was too much. I will use it again just not every single day.</li>
    <li> I just started to  use this product in allergy season when my eyes itch and smart. I get immediate relief and think that I can also see better since I am also nearsighted. I will give the product a while longer to see if the change persists.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product. Will know more after further usage of the product.</li>
    <li> I really did not see any benefit with these eye drops. I have chronic red eyes and purchased these to combat the redness.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed after using them and not seeing any change in my red eye problem. Also, they sting more than any other eye drops I have ever used, including prescription eye drops.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I have had sensitive eyes my whole life.  They get easily irritated and dry.  Ever since I started using these drops I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference.  In the past, after playing a round of golf, my eyes would be dry, irritated and bloodshot.  The last time I played, they were only slightly irritated and not bloodshot.  I will continue to buy these.</li>
    <li> These are the bomb.  They work to relieve my dry tired eyes which helps my actual sght.  I used to feel like I had to close my eyes in the late afternoon so I could stand the discomfort.  No more.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the many positive reviews only to realize those reviews were most likely all fabricated. This product is totally useless, it does nithing to improve your eye situation, whether you suffer from dry,red or itchy eyes. I have yet to find a product that relieves redness from allergies. Whoever rated this product good was obviously not &amp;#34;SEEING&amp;#34; well.</li>
    <li> Awesome , it help my eye became beautiful color eyes again and reduce red eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;MM</li>
    <li> Still stings a bit when used, but my wife and I like the clear feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> I do not know yet how it is working for my particular eye situation as I had hoped that I would experience a clearer vision after a fewer weeks of using the product. It may just take longer for my eyes to recover. I will continue to use it. It does help the dryness of my eyes from being on the computer.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product a lot. My eyes can get red and tired--too much computer use. And the over-the-counter stuff is laden with who-knows-what, so a natural product that does the trick? Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thing is: the burn. I don&#x27;t know about you but the whole reason I&#x27;m putting in eye drops is for the soothing effect it will produce. A burning effect? Well that&#x27;s the problem in the first place, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know...maybe the point is that these eye drops improve your eyes over the long run where as OTC drops just work for a while. Still...ouch.</li>
    <li> Did not work. Wasted money</li>
    <li> Really works!. Feels great since the first application</li>
    <li> Not sure.  Losing vision fast even though I have been using it 2X a day consistently for the past two weeks.</li>
    <li> I suffer very dry eyes and have a yellowing type of disorder (pinguecula) occurring.  I have been using these for less than a week and so far they have made a difference.  They only sting a bit at first and then my eyes look and feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> The whites of My eyes are a lot brighter! Yaaaay! Lol! I&#x27;ve had Dry red eyes for years. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used the drops for a while, didn&#x27;t notice any change re my dry eyes, and when I learned an opthalmolgist had discouraged putting drops into the eye that sting, because the pH of the eye doesn&#x27;t match (not the term he used).  While these drops may help others, they didn&#x27;t help me and I have discontinued them.  Re the sting - in fairness, it does burn a bit, but only for a few seconds.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Uncertain of any improvement, perhaps in time.</li>
    <li> I find this very refreshing and i feel it works better than your typical visine-type products. It really comes down to whether or not you want to use homeopathic or OTC products. I don&#x27;t notice that it makes my eyes white like some claim. For that, I&#x27;d recommend white-out or sherwin william&#x27;s paint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month so far. It does burn when putting in eyes. So far, no difference in my eyes. Not clearer, vessels not smaller. No difference.</li>
    <li> this is good it help me w/ my glaucoma</li>
    <li> the drops do sting but it is only for a few seconds, so far the drops have helped with dry eye and my allergies but I am waiting for my appt with my eye doctor - it&#x27;s his approval I&#x27;m looking for and then I will write a better review</li>
    <li> This is a most wonderful product...be aware it does sting temporarily when you put the drops in, but is a small price to pay for the health of your eyes...it has helped with my glaucoma and really does make my eyes brighter...!!! Love what this product does for my eyes!</li>
    <li> I have had dry, itchy and red eyes for years. I am not sure if it had anything to do with the weather, makeup or allergies, but whatever the case may be, I always got asked, \\&quot;Why are your eyes red?\\&quot; \\&quot;Do you know your eyes are red?\\&quot; \\&quot;Do you have pink eye?\\&quot; It was frustrating and embarrassing. I later started developing a little yellow bump near the inner part of eye and expanded towards my cornea. I started to get a little nervous and did some research. I realize you can&#x27;t diagnose yourself through via \\&quot;Google\\&quot; or other search engines, but with no time and no money for an eye doctor, I discovered as to what appeared to be a Pinguecula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a change in the normal tissue that results in a deposit of protein, fat and/or calcium. It is similar to a callus on the skin. So, I purchased this product and decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience any burning sensation as the other reviewers had mentioned. I was unsure if maybe I received a bad batch, but it was night time and I was off to bed, so I guess I had no choice to wait and see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I awoke with no itchy sensation. No Red Eyes. No Watering. For the first time in a long time, my eyes were white. Ok...I realize it&#x27;s the first day, but it definitely was a noticeable change. As far as the bump, I don&#x27;t expect too much to change, but I will continue and keep you posted on the results.</li>
    <li> These drops are working miracles on my dogs eyes The bulging has go down and he seems happier again!</li>
    <li> after week 2 of using eyebright I noticed a huge difference in less pressure and pain. Less eye headaches. a great relief overall. I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference in my red eye condition but I only used it for a week. It really burns but I did not mind as long as it worked and in a weeks time it had not.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything to alleviate my blepharitis  I&#x27;d hoped it would reduce the inflammation blocking the sebum in my eyelids.  No such luck.  It does sting quite a bit, though.  I&#x27;d suffer the sting if it made an improvement, but this is all pain and no gain.</li>
    <li> These drops are wonderful. I have severe dry eye and have tried everything including the poplar prescription to no avail. The very first day I used this my tearing was greatly reduced; the 2nd day  I did not experience tearing at all.  What a blessing as I have been tearing for over 7 years. These drops do sting a little when applying only for a few seconds.  I also realized no need to reapply during the day. My other drops were used 2,3, or even 4 times a day and still tearing occurred.  I am so thankful to have come across  these.  My hunt for good and effective eye drops is finally over.</li>
    <li> Burns when you put drops in but fades in about a minute.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it does anything.</li>
    <li> This has proven to be a good and more effective replacement for other more expensive over-the-counter and $300+ prescription Restasis in treating my very dry eye problem</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product that heals my eyes.  I would recommend this too any one!!! It is good for prevention!</li>
    <li> These drops are all natural, and they really helped to soothe my itchy eyes while treating blepharitis.  I would even put some on the skin around my eyes where it was red, itchy and sometimes a bit sore.  I don&#x27;t know if they actually helped to treat the blepharitis or simply relieved the symptoms, but they do contain sulfur, which is reported to help.  The sulfur content is the reason I bought them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 4 stars rather than 5, because it did burn a little.  The burn didn&#x27;t last long, however, and they were a life saver when I had to be out and about.  Carry them with you.</li>
    <li> This stuff burns like heck after it goes in your eyes.  I only use it when my eyes are feeling really tired and red.  It does help, but not any better than other eye drops in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Seems to do a better job than some of the more expensive ones sold otc.  Thanks for a&lt;br /&gt;great natural product.</li>
    <li> Good Product, received in a few days, will order again.</li>
    <li> Great Service...Great Product</li>
    <li> I really like this eye drop it gives great relief for dry irritated eyes.  Although it has not brighten my eyes?</li>
    <li> worked for my dog in 24hours...but kinda seems like regular eye drops wit apple cider vinegar and home remedies.</li>
    <li> My eyes were suddenly crusty with yellow discharge when I woke up in the mornings and I noticed slimy clear substance that I could pull out in long strings out my eyes. I thought perhaps I may have contracted a minor infection and decided to try this product while waiting to see my opthamologist on a delayed appointment. The eye drops did sting a bit but they were tolerable. The day after the initial drops, I noticed significantly increased yellow discharge. After few more days of use, the yellow discharge and mucus inclusions completely went away and I was waking up with clear eyes again. Whatever the ailment was, the eye drops took care of it by the time I saw my Opthamologist. When I asked about the symptoms after my healthy eye exam, he said it could&#x27;ve been anything such as allergy or seasonal irritation. I showed him the Eyebright drops bottle for his opinion, and he said the ingredients are safe to use as he saw nothing harmful. I asked about the msm (sulfur) that some of the reviewers complain about, and he said the ingredient is perfectly safe for most people who are not allergic to sulfur (cabbabe, broccoli, cauliflower, etc). As for the eye floaters that some reviewers report of clearing, I already knew the answer but the Dr. confirmed that there&#x27;s no supplement that will make eye floaters go away; However, the larger floater segments can break to smaller pieces and become less noticeable in time. For those buying this to clear floaters - please don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve done my research on this since I had floaters since I was a child. Eyebright herb, which I&#x27;ve also tried ingesting, may improve eye health and possibly prevent worsening of floaters, but the only procedure to clear existing floaters is an operation called Vitrectomy (strain out eye fluid with surgical needles) for bad enough cases only. For those with eye irritations, this product may be worth a try. I found out MSM actually provides many eye benefits that you can easily google to research, as do other included ingredients Grapefruit Seed Extract and Apple Cider Vinegar (probably what causes the stings). I can&#x27;t call this product soothing, but it helps with eye strains and irritations and my eyes do feel more refreshed after the initial stings.arch, as do other included ingredients Grapefruit Seed Extract and Apple Cider Vinegar (probably what causes the stings).

    <li> Then for some reason my eye got really red- inflamed. But my eyes have been red/inflamed before that. So it didnt really do much for me. Idk.I stopped using it. I started eating alot of carrots,wheat grass and spinach and some herbs with it.and that has really helped me from them not being red. ;)</li>
    <li> Love it makes my eyes feel great</li>
    <li> My son had an eye infection problem that was not solved using conventional medication even after three doctor visits over a period of three months.I decided to try this product after some research into the ingredients and within one month of use the positive results were very evident. I am happy with this product and hardly ever use it now since his immune system has things under control. It worked in harmony with his immune system.Hope it works for others.</li>
    <li> I have been battling dry eye syndrome for many years now. I feel like I&#x27;ve used every product on the market. Then I tried this natural eyebright. I keep it in the fridge so it has a nice cooling effect. Yes, it does sting but relieves dry itchy eyes after continuous use. I have been using it every day for about 6 weeks now and my eyes are much clearer and less gritty feeling. I think people fail to realize that a product must be used long term in order to get desired results. Stick with this eye drop and you&#x27;ll be amazed at the health and appearance of your eyes!</li>
    <li> Works well. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Helps with my eyes, redness, dryness, fatigued feeling in eyes. All in all, works quite well.</li>
    <li> I received the product 6 days ago. It came with the manufactures safety seal, and an expiration date of 6/2017.&lt;br /&gt;I put 2 drops in each eye every morning, it stings a little as expected for a few seconds but then after my eyes&lt;br /&gt;water a little they feel great. What sold me on this product is the ingredient, Apple cider vinegar which is something&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for years. My eyes feel GREAT!.</li>
    <li> They sting so I don&#x27;t use them often.</li>
    <li> I have been having trouble waking up with a gritty feeling in my eyes, so I gave this a try.  So far I am amazed at the results.</li>
    <li> Quickly relieves dryness. Good product. Better than expected.</li>
    <li> It says in the label that it will only sting the eye temporarily. Tried it on one eye, but the sting would not go away even for a day. I&#x27;ve tried all things to make the sting go away. At last it finally did, after using an eyewash cup. Terrible!</li>
    <li> I have only been using these drops for a little while now, but I love them. They do sting a slight bit when you first put them in but it&#x27;s not bad at all and in a way almost feels good. I feel like they have made my eyes brighter and less irritated and dry!</li>
    <li> Waiting for improvement.  Still hopeful.</li>
    <li> I had lasik surgery several years ago and my homeopath recommended this product to maintain my vision clarity. Really works!</li>
