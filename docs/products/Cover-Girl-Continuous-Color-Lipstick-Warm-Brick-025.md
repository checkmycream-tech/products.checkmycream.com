<li> so I&#x27;m not surprised by the quality of the lipstick especially for the price I paid for it on here.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;lipstick stays on even after eating, doesn&#x27;t get that dry hard look and didn&#x27;t cost that much.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not orangy like bricks, but not too pink.</li>
<li> This is not quite the color I expected.  </li>
<li> Did not have to waste gas going to the store and got what I wanted while I just sat home and went about my business.</li>
<li> I just hate I always buy the same shades on accident.</li>
<li> it also was really bad because it was hard.</li>
