    <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is the best 11.00 dollars I ever spent it curl better the one I paid 55.00 for :)</li>
    <li> Wish it were lighter in weight.</li>
    <li> Takes forever to heat up</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! well worth the price plus some.  If you&#x27;re worried about it getting hot enough, don&#x27;t.  It melted my sink because i wasn&#x27;t careful where I sat it down.</li>
    <li> used &amp; liked it, but does not hold in humidity</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Especially considering the price.  With 3 females under one roof, we have every type of styling tool known to man, but we still all have our favorites.  This happens to be one of them!  So, I&#x27;ll be buying a few more so we all have one of our own-WHICH, I can do because the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter has (normal to dry) LONG, thick, (more coarse-ethnic like) gorgeous hair, &amp; she LOVES this iron.  Her curls stay all day.&lt;br /&gt;My pre-teen daughter has (normal to oily) long, thick, silky-soft (baby fine hair-but GOBS of it) &amp; this iron also holds her hair all day.&lt;br /&gt;I have (dry to rigamortis) CRAZY (not curly, nor straight), difficult to manage (different textures-some seemingly inhuman-more like that of the hair of a boar&#x27;s A$$), unruly hair.  This also works for ME!  (Unbelievable, I know)&lt;br /&gt;So, we have all of the textures &amp; hair types under one roof &amp; we all love this product.  That&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is perfect for me! While it&#x27;s recommended for thicker, coarser hair, it really works on my fine, thin hair. Usually if I curl my hair, it&#x27;s 1/2 straight with the curls falling out w/in a few hours, regardless of how much mousse or hairspray I put in my hair. The dial allows you to have to several different heat settings, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it burning your hair off. This absolutely works on my hair!</li>
    <li> From the ad I was requesting &amp;#34;Hot &amp; Gold&amp;#34; brand product, never heard of this brand, I &#x27;ve not used it yet, but do like the variable temp setting.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as an extra hair curler for trips.  I have lots of hair, but it is fine.  This curling iron does the job.  It heats up fast and the curl holds well.  The shipping time was right on the dot.  I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Very nice and shiny! Like swivel cord connect and handle. A not too tight on the clamping and holding of hair &amp; WAY TOO HOT if up all the way or--even half temp. Use Caution and be aware when using , but works great.</li>
    <li> I have notoriously difficult hair to curl, and this one did the trick. It even lasted throughout the day fairly well!</li>
    <li> Gets so hot works great.</li>
    <li> This is a very good curling iron.  I like everything about it EXCEPT the placement of the temp. control!  As I use it, it&#x27;s in a place where I am constantly moving the little rolling control.  I just put up with it and try to be more careful because I like the way it does my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron.  I honestly wasnt expecting much because of the price,  so I was pleasantly surprised. It actually has a swivel end which is awesome for curling.  No cord getting tangled.  What a great deal!  It has stayed consistently hot each time I&#x27;ve used it. It also has an adjustable temperature dial.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I have the Lava Gold flat iron.  The curling has the same good temperature control and is well made.</li>
    <li> Better then professional ones. I&#x27;m a licensed hairdresser and didn&#x27;t want to pay crazy prices (even with my discount) so I ordered this. AWESOME!!!!:)</li>
    <li> It burns and breaks hair faster than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Not recommend!</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast and works very well, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> I had to buy this when I left my other curling iron in another city two hours away. I think this one is better than my original. The curls stay longer and my hair is more curly. Please read warnings unless you don&#x27;t mind burning chunks of your hair off because this does get that hot. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron!  Use it almost daily.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best curling irons I have ever owned, it curls nice and in the middle!! Perfect for my hair type!! I definitely recommend!!</li>
