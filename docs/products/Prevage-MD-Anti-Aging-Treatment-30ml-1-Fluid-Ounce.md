      <li>I am so glad I found it on line.</li>
      <li>I love the product</li>
      <li>I would recommend Prevage MD but be sure you know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>

      <li>and I love it,</li>
      <li>My skin looks more luminous, with a youthful glow I haven&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
      <li>My doctor ordered Prednizone to counteract the allergic reaction and I am doing better.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Prevage MD for many years</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>Doctor gave me a shot of cortisone and then more pills.</li>
      <li>My skin is much, much better.</li>
      <li>I love the texture.  </li>
      <li>The regular Prevage from Elizabeth Arden is diluted so it will not deliver the best results.  </li>
      <li>IF you&#x27;re a cougar or a cougar wannabee, you&#x27;ll love this product.  </li>
      <li>Everyone is different, so if your not allergic, then it is a wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>At 70 years of age that is quite amazing in its own right.</li>
      <li>Hi, I bought this product with high hopes afer reading some great reviews.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, this is pretty good stuff.</li>
      <li>It is well worth the money!!</li>
      <li>she&#x27;s brilliant and is involved in all kinds of research at Stanford and UCSF medical schools.  </li>
      <li>At any rate, the real product is good.  </li>
      <li>This product is awesome for mild to moderate aging signs in the face and neck!!!</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, and it does help the tone and quality of the skin.</li>
      <li>I am so happy considering the fact I have so many allergic reactions to different products.</li>
      <li>Beware, this is a strong treatment.</li>
      <li>I am 61 years old and my skin looks amazing!  </li>
      <li>First two times, she liked it.  </li>
      <li>Fine lines, and discoloration have been noticeably reduced.  </li>
      <li>Sun spots lightened and fine wrinkles disappeared.</li>
      <li>What ingredient in this product would cause this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for listening and any input or ideas you have on this reaction I&#x27;d be happy to hear about it to figure out why I had such a severe reaction.</li>
      <li>Just really smooth, almost poreless skinn.</li>
      <li>The doctor confirmed it was a contact dermatitist and prescribed a 10 day steroids pack.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my legs - under fluorescent light to boot.  </li>
      <li>It is a fabulous product.  </li>
      <li>When I stopped using it my face did not look as smooth or even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, it has a really lightly perfumed smell, nothing offensive, so</li>
      <li>Fabulous product.</li>
      <li>I just hope I can get my great looking skin back again.  </li>
      <li>I know that to effectively get rid of your wrinkles, you have to have some kind of deep peel, preferably the CO2 laser.</li>
      <li>The exclusive Idibenone ingredient is patented and only available to this company!!!</li>
      <li>BUT- make sure you get the real thing from a DR!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this one</li>
      <li>but my skin is better than most 40 year old women.</li>
      <li>With Prevage correcting my face, my body&#x27;s natural healing powers are more able to correct the rest of me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best stuff on the marker today!</li>
    <li> This Prevage Anti-Aging fluid is really magical!  Results are noticeable within a few weeks.  It is the basis of my skin regime and well worth the cost. I have used it for 3 years and do not intend to stop!</li>
    <li> This was my second bottle of Prevage.  The first I had purchased from an M.D. and was very impressed with the way my skin began improving almost immediately.  However, the bottle I purchased through Amazon lacked the same feel, nor did it produce the same results.  It felt as though it had been diluted.  At any rate, the real product is good.  Perhaps this was just a fluke and the company produced an batch that was inferior.  In the future, I&#x27;ll just purchase from my doctor again.  I would recommend Prevage MD but be sure you know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of Prevage by my dermatalogist. Applied it one time. I am not particularly sensitive to lotions, etc. Woke up 24 hours later with eyes swollen shut and face bright red, burning and swollen so that I was unrecognizable. My doctor ordered Prednizone to counteract the allergic reaction and I am doing better. I have since heard of others with the same reaction. Will probable take a week to subside, hopefully with no lasting effects.  Beware, this is a strong treatment. I would definitely not apply any without a skin patch test first.</li>
    <li> I bought Prevage MD from my dermatologist for $135.00 and as soon as I put it in my face I noticed a funny smell, it also gave me a rash after just 2 days. I bought Visage MD with 1.5% Idebenone and I love it, it has no smell and it has repaired my sun  damaged skin. Buy Visage MD instead of Prevage, you will be a lot happier.    Gloria De La Ruz</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Prevage MD for a couple years now.  I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s doing much but I figure it&#x27;s a long term kind of thing (like my skin my be worse if I hadn&#x27;t been using it...am I just rationalizing?)?  Anyway, I&#x27;ve bought it both at a doctor&#x27;s office and online -- no difference in product in my experience.  Also I never had any bad reactions like rashes...I think it&#x27;s possible that people can be sensitive to anything but I had no problem.  Also, it has a really lightly perfumed smell, nothing offensive, so I don&#x27;t know what other reviewers are talking about unless what they got was spoiled or something.  So, all in all, I&#x27;ve had no negative experience with it but I can&#x27;t say I woke up one morning with a completely new complexion either.  My derm says it&#x27;s good stuff (and not because she sells it because she doesn&#x27;t) and I trust her...she&#x27;s brilliant and is involved in all kinds of research at Stanford and UCSF medical schools.  We&#x27;re all looking for quick beauty fixes.  Do they really exist???</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I did not have any bad reaction to Prevage MD, but a friend of mine did.  If you are one of the person that don&#x27;t get bad reaction from Prevage MD, you&#x27;re a lucky girl.  From all the expesive creams I have bought during the years, so far this is the best one.  It delivers results and fasts.  I am 43yrs, I had a line in between my eye brows that in order to make it dissapear I went for botox.  Unfortunately, Botox is too expensive for me and only last 6 months, so my doctor recommended me Prevage MD.  The line between my eye brows has dissapeared.  Prevage MD has helped me get my skin soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom and it has lighten up dark areas of my face.  I recently, stared using this cream on the dark circles around my eyes.  The product instructions do not read that can be use for around the eye areas but I took my chances.  After putting the Prevage MD on the dark circles, I use a good moisturizer right after and I start noticing the dark circles getting lighter.  I am sticking to this product.  I always keep 2 bottles in my house.    PS: Prevage MD is not the same as Prevage.  Prevage MD is pure.  The regular Prevage from Elizabeth Arden is diluted so it will not deliver the best results.  Both Prevage, MD and regular, cost about the same price.</li>
    <li> My skin doctor told me to use this .</li>
    <li> I have been using Prevage MD for many years and I love it.  My recent purchase was the first time I bought it online.  The price was much less than I usually pay and my order arrived very fast. I would definitely recommend ABZOO to my friends. I plan to not only order this product from ABZOO but to explore what other items they sell.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product about 6 weeks ago. I got it from an MD&#x27;s office and read all the literature included with the container. I found it to have a really good effect on my dry skin/minor wrinkles and I am middle aged. It has a hydrating effect, and if you get your regular rest and are not run-down or tired, it gives your skin a really nice, firmer texture. It&#x27;s not a miracle drug; nothing is. I know that to effectively get rid of your wrinkles, you have to have some kind of deep peel, preferably the CO2 laser. I have used other products and like this one - I would definitely use it again. All products have the potential to cause allergies.</li>
    <li> Run, don&#x27;t walk to buy this product.  I&#x27;m 46 years old and everyone compliments my even skin tone.  I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation - ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I had used prevage MD years ago with great results.  It does improve the tone and texture of your skin.  I unfortunately have developed ocular rosacea over the years and have found that this product aggravates it.  So, the botton line is it is a great product but if you have sensitive skin, you may want to try a small sample at the store first if you can.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these as gifts for my daughters.  I have used Prevage for some time now and wanted to see if they would like this.  Both of them had allergic reactions to the product and could not use it.  They gave it to me, and upon use, I realized quickly that it is not the prevage I have been using. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product.. been using it for at least 10 years. I wish they would make it in a clear container so i know when I&#x27;m about to run out, but I love the product.   Seller was fast and efficient.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my face after being recommended to use it by a dermatologist.  I used a pea sized portion and immediately my face turned beet red.  Five days later still have a red rash on my cheeks and down the left side of my face.  I have been to a clnic to receive a shot(as it was a Friday night)  and get a Rx for a dose pak.  I now have to use cortisone cream take an allergy pill(a.m. and p.m.), dose pak, cold compresses to my face went back to the dermatologist on Monday.  This might be a wonderful product but please whatever you do test it on tiny area for a few days before using on your whole face.    7-15-2011  It is now almost 2 years later and I still have a severe reaction on my face when I go out in the sun.  That is what I do all summer I am a gardener but I can no longer do this from putting one pea sized portion of Prevage M.D. on my face one time!</li>
    <li> This was formerly only available in doctor&#x27;s offices. Now there is no need to pay doctors VERY inflated prices for this great product. It&#x27;s active ingredient, 1% Idebedone, is a powerful antioxident. Please note, if you have sensitive skin, Prevage MD may irritate your skin. Be advised. I have been using this for several years and I&#x27;m very, very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Apparently, I&#x27;m allergic to it.  Makes the area around my eyes redden and swell.  I would suggest putting a little on your arm before applying to the face for the first time.</li>
    <li> My skin looks ten years younger.  Fine lines, and discoloration have been noticeably reduced.  I love this product and the price in very resonable.</li>
    <li> I used Prevage MD for about a month two times a Day. One day My upper and lower eyelids became red and itchy and I thought it was my sunscreen. The doctor confirmed it was a contact dermatitist and prescribed a 10 day steroids pack. However, I didn&#x27;t stop using the Prevage thinking there was no connection. Seven days later (while still on the meds) I awoke to my entire face and neck area in a red, itchy, bumpy allergic fiasco. I had never seen such a reaction in all my life to any food or product I ever used! The. Doctor gave me a shot of cortisone and then more pills. That was yesterday and my rash is getting better but it was so severe and so shocking to me that it happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The literature downplays contact dermatis from this product but I&#x27;d like to hear if anyone has has a similar reaction. What ingredient in this product would cause this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for listening and any input or ideas you have on this reaction I&#x27;d be happy to hear about it to figure out why I had such a severe reaction.</li>
    <li> I agree with a lot of the other reviewers. I had an absolutely horrifying experience with Prevage, which came as a sample in a sephora package. It took 2 courses of prednisone - very strong - to get it under control and although my face was the worst, it inflamed and irritated beyond words my entire body. It was absolutely everywhere and so unbelievably itchy and painful. I would say I have normal skin, too, not overly sensitive and had never had an allergic reaction before. I am very glad I did not purchase the product, which apparently has warnings but the sample does not so beware if you get one. I only gave it a star because Amazon forced me too to submit this review. It&#x27;s really more like negative 1,000,000 stars...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found the Elizabeth Arden Prevage to work great. No rashes or anything bad. Just really smooth, almost poreless skinn. Beautiful. I switched because it was a tad cheaper buying MD over Elizabeth Arden online. The MD-version seems a bit harsher (maybe stronger). I use it on my face and chest and the PrevageMD makes my chest itch. No bumps or rashes, but it definitely itches.  After two weeks, I finally got a clue and switched back to Elizabeth Arden on my chest and no more itching.  And my face appears to be breaking out more since using PrevageMD. I usually don&#x27;t have much of a problem with zits, but have started seeing small pimples pop up since I started using PrevageMD.  However, my skin still looks poreless...just with some minor blemishes.  I&#x27;m definitely going back to using the Elizabeth Arden-version as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Prevage for a few months now and my skin is feeling firmer and my wrinkles are lessened.  I&#x27;ll be 50 in a month.</li>
    <li> I had a HORRIBLE allergic reaction to this product.  My entire face swelled up like a balloon and my eyes were swollen shut for days.  I nicknamed myself \\&quot;alien\\&quot;.  I do not normally have sensitive skin and this product has now made me wary to try new skin creams.</li>
    <li> Prevage MD is all that it is hyped up to be by Elizabeth Arden,  For once a cosmetic company is not trying to market their way into our wallets with some silly concoction.  Fine lines have disappeared, sun spots have lightened and my skin looks like it did during the &#x27;collagen years!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years.  My skin looks beautiful and never breaks out from it.  I am so happy considering the fact I have so many allergic reactions to different products.</li>
    <li> I am 40 but look 25 due to years of using Retin-A- but was really annoyed by all the peeling. My dermatologist gave me Prevage MD- I love it! Scientifically (I am a scientist by profession) the Retin A 1% should be better, but I have found that Prevage MD makes my skin look even younger- without all the irritation of Retin A. It is even reducing the two teeny lines I was getting around my eyes. My skin looks more luminous, with a youthful glow I haven&#x27;t seen in years. BUT- make sure you get the real thing from a DR! My cousin tried it from a website and ended up with irritation. When she purchased from a DR- it worked perfectly! If you can afford it- this is the best stuff out there.</li>
    <li> I have been using Prevage MD for 5 years now. I am almost 60 but no one has ever guessed me to be older than 45.  I credit Prevage MD. I have purchased it through both a doctor&#x27;s office and Amazon.com. I have never experienced any difference in results. A few years ago Elizabeth Arden/Allergan did change the texture of the product by adding more moisturizing ingredients. That may be what other reviewers have referred to when they found that the product seemed somewhat \\&quot;diluted\\&quot; which differed from their previous purchases. There have been times when I ran out of Prevage MD and had to wait a month to reorder. During that time I would see a significant change in my skin&#x27;s smoothness and overall healthy appearance. After reordering and using the product again, the results were visible and greatly improved within a couple days. It has been years since I ordered this product from a doctor. I always order through various vendors on Amazon.com and have never received anything but the real product. I consider Prevage an necessity, not a luxury, and can testify that the product sold through Amazon.com is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I bought the Prevage trial kit with four small pump bottles.  I really, really, REALLY wanted this product to work.  After reading about the rash outbreaks experienced by many, I tried this product using a VERY small amount applied only to my deepest facial creases.  It was all fine for about 2 weeks (long after the period suggested when doing a patch test).  After that time, I developed a horrible rash on my foot.  It spread to my lower leg, then I got patches of it on my thigh.  The next rashy area developed on my hands, then I had some patches on my face.  The itching is absolutely intense, with small blisters and \\&quot;weeping\\&quot;.  Cortisone ointment helped me stop the itch long enough so I wouldn&#x27;t scratch in my sleep.  Having it on the foot is agony because the rubbing created by walking causes the rash to itch madly and simultaneously supply a simulated scratching.  This creates a viscious cycle of itching, scratching, further irritation and outbreak, etc.  I am surprised this product managed to find its way on the market when there are so many people adversely affected by it.  It is a highly-priced form of torture.  You may be one of the lucky people not experiencing a reaction, but you may also be one of those whose reaction is delayed.  Are you willing to take the risk?  I have to say it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Oh my God! I&#x27;ve used this only 3 days now.  Prevage MD started working immediately.  Sun spots lightened and fine wrinkles disappeared. Not only does my face look better, but the skin on the rest of my body (where I&#x27;m NOT applying Prevage) is improving too -- Imagine that! The skin on my legs is noticeably smoother.  Yesterday, I was working out at the gym (wearing shorts) and I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my legs - under fluorescent light to boot.  The only explanation I can think of is this: With Prevage correcting my face, my body&#x27;s natural healing powers are more able to correct the rest of me.  This stuff is worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I, too, had a terrible allergic reaction to Prevage. This product couldn&#x27;t have made my skin look -- and feel -- worse if it had been made with poison ivy! I broke out in a red, itchy blistering rash all over my face and neck. My eyes were swollen, my face was puffy and itchy! I do not have very sensitive skin and have never reacted to anything the way I have this product. I recommend testing it on a small area for several nights, and wash your hands thoroughly after you apply. I would give it zero stars if I could. A very expensive disaster!</li>
    <li> Did nothing whatsoever for my complexion.  It cost enough and I expected to see some results, but saw nothing after over a month of regular use.</li>
    <li> I have been using Prevage MD twice daily for two years and have found that it has reduced fine lines and given my skin a firmer look. Using Prevage MD daily including moisture creams and sunscreen keeps my skin looking younger.</li>
    <li> ...but it&#x27;s true that some people have a bad reaction. The dermatologist that I used to buy it from stopped carrying it because of that. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years and it improves the quality of my skin more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. You only need to apply a little bit, so it lasts a long time. If you can, try to get a sample and try it out for a few days before purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Prevage MD consistently for about three years, based on a reliable source mentioning that it has one of the highest concentrations available of one of the most powerful antioxidants.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I have no idea if it works. Anybody who tells you they are seeing results from using any cream or lotion is lying or deluded. My complexion looks very good, but how would it look had I used another product? Probably the same. Still, I choose to believe that if any product can have an effect, this one will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many products and have undergone various minor cosmetic procedures (microdermabrasion, laser genesis and photofacials) and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction.  After using Prevage MD for two weeks, my race erupted in a rash-- itchy, red, bumpy and swollen.  It&#x27;s so bad that I have to take steroids and apply topical cortisone.  I have NEVER experienced something like this and hope that nobody has else has to go through it.  I now look terrible, feel very uncomfortable and have to take off days from work to hopefully re-cooperate.  Please don&#x27;t risk your face on this product, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Prevage is an amazing product! I am an aesthetician that retails this in a doctors office. It is a very strong product that delivers wondeful results. Products that are purchased where they are not technically supposed to be purchased (ie: Paul Mitchell in Stop n Shop) are usually fake or tampered with. Also, there are problems with irritation from Prevage due to the dyes and fragrances that have been added to hide the horrible scent of the wondefully working ingredient. When purchased in the proper location, you will love your skin after using this product! FYI Visage MD is a claiming to have 1.5% Ibedenone and they are selling it online. Either that is a lie, or they will get in a lot of trouble soon.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to help even out skin tones and help with tiny lines and wrinkles.  I used it once per day and felt a tingling sensation for the first few applications, but no other skin reactions.  I increased the useage over time to the morning and evening, and can really see the improvement in my skin.  It is softer, more luminous, and has slightly decreased the uneven skin tones and tiny lines.  I recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve tried several and I&#x27;m hooked on this one.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. I have been using Prevage MD for two years and see very good results.  I use it only at nightime.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Well, at first it \\&quot;seemed\\&quot; to improve the look and appearance of the skin on my arms, which received a lot of sun damage as a kid and appeared significantly older than my 45 years (mostly age spots and fine dry-skin wrinkles). I wouldn&#x27;t say that the improvement was dramatic - just a vague lightening of the age spots and mild improvement in wrinkling over the first half of the bottle - but at over $100.00 I was expecting better results and it didn&#x27;t help that the stuff has a rather offensive smell (though that doesn&#x27;t linger for a long time), so I opted to skip the next bottle for more cost-effective treatments...</li>
    <li> I had been using Prevage MD for years as my dermatologist recommended.  About four months ago I thought I would save some money by buying and using an inexpensive store brand moisturizer.  Couldn&#x27;t make that much difference right?  WRONG!!!  My skin has deteriorated noticeably.  The skin tone is uneven with dry patches.  My skin doesn&#x27;t look young and moist.  I have learned my lesson and am returning to Prevage MD and I&#x27;ll never be unfaithful again.  I just hope I can get my great looking skin back again.  Learn from my mistake and don&#x27;t skimp.  This product is 100% worth every cent you pay for it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years and it is the best cream that I have found so far</li>
    <li> Please be careful with this product!  I used it in by eye area, became red and raw for 3 days!!! If it was not for another review I would have not be imagine this could happen!&lt;br /&gt;Will toss out!  Cannot even give it away!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Prevage for a number of years and it is excellent. When I saw the MD on Amazon, I jumped on it and love it! Quite honestly, Prevage has a very unique color and smell, and the container is comes is sealed. Meaning, tampering or counterfeit products are highly unlikely. Either way....great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;PS. I actually received 1 that was damaged from shipping (in with cat food) and sent it back with no issues whatsoever! Thanks</li>
    <li> I am 61 years old and my skin looks amazing!  I have been using Prevage MD since early spring and I love it,</li>
    <li> Got a major skin rash, had to go to a dermatologist! I had been using this product, purchased from my dermatologist and NEVER had a problem! The one I ordered from Amazon caused a three week skin disaster!</li>
    <li> I have not seen any difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My expectation were quite high, based on the price of this product</li>
    <li> I was reading some of the reactions to Prevage MD and I had exactly the same reaction as another poster. I used it for about a month and suddenly I woke up to a red, burned-feeling face. It itched so badly I cried. Nothing over the counter would stop it. My eyes were swollen shut and then my face began to peel. It was horrible! I ended up going to the doctor and had to have a steroid injection to stop the rapid advancement of my allergic reaction.(Which was progressing even as I sat in the doctor&#x27;s office.) I do not have overly sensitive skin and have never had a reaction to any lotions or other treatments before, but I made up for lost time when I used Prevage MD. When I told my doctor what had happened she said, \\&quot;Oh yes, that happens fairly often.\\&quot;  That might have been good to know before I shelled out $135.  Be very careful.  I learned a very expensive lesson.</li>
    <li> Hi, I bought this product with high hopes afer reading some great reviews.  I used it for about a month and did not really notice any improvement in my skin (but sometimes it is hard to tell when you look at yourself everyday).  I didn&#x27;t recieve any compliments about how great my skin looked during this time, but I thought, hey, just give it time..... than after about a month, my face swelled up....bad.  I thought that if I continued using it, that the reaction would go away and I would see some results, so I continued using it for over a week and my face looked BAD.  It was swollen and looked like I was a having a serious allergic reaction. It was bumpy and red and itchy and I looked like I was recuperating from a bad sunburn or chemical peel. I had to stop using it, I was in so much pain.  I tried it again after a couple weeks and instantly my face was swollen and red again for 3 days.  Sigh.... I was really hoping this would work.  Back to the drawing board......</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately five years and it is outstanding; I am just beginning to use on my neck and chest and already I can see a dramatic difference</li>
    <li> My skin got a very bad chemical burn that is taking days to heal. Also tiny pimples where I put the creams to try and help heal the burn. Maybe I should have used it another way? I put it on like a serum at night, nothing else on top and woke up to a bad burn.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this one but I was also worried because I read some comments about skin irritation. I was expecting some redness or something but all good. I am using it for over 6 weeks now and finally I can say &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; something happened here. My skin looks fresh and young. It doesn&#x27;t feel that smooth or soft but my skin looks great . I am ordering again. No skin irritation for me !!</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles of Prevage MD.  I love the product but they had been previously opened.  And, although I don&#x27;t believe any product is missing, it does concern me.</li>
    <li> Have used this off and on for YEARS when Ican afford it!&lt;br /&gt;Huge difference in my skin/tons of compliments and recommended by my dermatologist/skin expert!!&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS GET THE MD BRAND Prevage as it is the strongest!</li>
    <li> This product causes a rash on my face when used every other day.  I&#x27;ve had to stop using it all together until the rash goes away.  I&#x27;ll see if my skin tolerates its use on a twice weekly basis.</li>
    <li> IF you&#x27;re a cougar or a cougar wannabee, you&#x27;ll love this product.  Best price.</li>
    <li> this product takes away the tired look but be careful its strong and a little goes a long way can cause breakouts</li>
    <li> My expectations for a skin cream are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1) Do no harm&lt;br /&gt;2) Provide a positive cost to benefit ratio&lt;br /&gt;3) Show benefits within a reasonable amount of time.....a month or two at most&lt;br /&gt;4) Be pleasant to use. No strange medicinal smells nor oil slick texture&lt;br /&gt;5) Must not attract insects or create skin eruptions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is pretty good stuff. It goes on easily, and it does help the tone and quality of the skin. I have not had an adverse reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An earlier attempt at Retin A was a disaster. My face burned and became red and chapped. My dermatologist&#x27;s advice was to stick it out. I caved (please refer to #s 1-5 as listed above). I am not a masochist....at least where my skin is involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find much of the Olay Definity and Regenerist lines of products excellent but lately I&#x27;ve realized I needed something more....powerful. There are other options out there but Prevage MD works for me. I use it under my other creams. When I stopped using it my face did not look as smooth or even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives to this product are:&lt;br /&gt;A) Some reviewers have reported reactions to the strength. Test before you try&lt;br /&gt;B) The color is an odd yellow-brown when it comes out of the bottle but it goes on clear&lt;br /&gt;C) The smell is sort of pukey but it doesn&#x27;t make me actually puke and it doesn&#x27;t linger long&lt;br /&gt;D) There is only 1 fluid ounce in the bottle....this is not a lot of product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know of something better (please refer to #s 1-5 as listed above) please let me know.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for mild to moderate aging signs in the face and neck!!! It is well worth the money!! The dermatologist charged twice as much in her office for this product.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for years from my doctor. She does not sell it any more and I pursued something else  I did not like it. I am so glad I found it on line. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I started using Prevage Face in 2005.  I loved it!  It was to be used day and night and everywhere including eyes and lips.  Then Elizabeth Arden decided to split the products into categories, and developed prevage anti-aging serum.  It doesn&#x27;t brighten my complexion the way that Prevage Face did...it just sort of goes on, absorbs then nothing.  I&#x27;ve decided to stop trying with Prevage.  Sorry Elizabeth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about seven years and would highly recommend it!  It is a great anti aging product and contains twice the active ingredient you find in the big stores at the malls.</li>
    <li> As many other prior users of Prevage MD, I began to get itchy spots--not right away, but after approximately 6 weeks of use. Three spots on my forehead, one along an eyebrow, and one along the side of my nose.  This frightened me, given what I had read of the bad experience others had with itching and rashes--I stopped using this product immediately.  I have not used Prevage MD for over 4 months.  The itchy spots that developed during use of this product calmed down after I quit using it, but they have not gone away.  Intermittent itching followed by the spot getting dry and crusty and then peeling--over and over and over again.  I have made an appointment with my dermatologist and am hoping for relief.  Be careful with this one folks!!!</li>
    <li> As much as I love Prevage, this version caused an allergic reaction on my nect and face.  This version is so strong, even one drop mixed with water still caused me to go red and swollen.  Everyone is different, so if your not allergic, then it is a wonderful product.  Just be cautious when using.</li>
    <li> I have used Prevage MD for years.....not the Prevage sold in department stores but the 1% ibodene concentration.  Although I rotate some other things into my regime for my acne prone skin, Prevage MD is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; skin treatment.  I continue to have people ask me what I am using.  I am over 50 and my skin looks very healthy with few wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I purchased PrevageMD from a Plastic Surgeon&#x27;s office. It is a fabulous product.  I have red areas on my face and little broken blood vessels and this product makes the skin look even-toned and luminous. I can almost get away without foundation when using this product.  I ran out of PrevageMD and tried some other products but they didn&#x27;t perform anywhere near this one.  I love the texture.  It is creamy and smooths over the face very easily.  I have never noticed any foul odor so I don&#x27;t know what some of the other reviewers are talking about. But, as with any product that goes on your skin, you need to follow the directions and try a small patch and then start with only once a day.  I&#x27;ve only had a bit of redness the very first time I used it and after that, it&#x27;s been fantastic.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girl for the third time.  First two times, she liked it.  The third bottle gave her a severe rash and made her neck swell up.  Perhaps it was a counterfeit, but, I won&#x27;t take any chances on buying it again.</li>
    <li> Using this for a long time and find it is anti-aging. Pricey, but visible results. Apply a small amount every day.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been using it for about a year and see a remarkable improvement on my skin!</li>
    <li> Prevage is one product that makes a difference on skin and the difference in quite noticeable. Don&#x27;t buy it at the department stores or doctor&#x27;s office. This is an excellent product at an even better price.</li>
    <li> I  buy this product from a dermatologist&#x27;s office. I tried buying online.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the actual package, I noticed the bottom was tampered with and the inside&lt;br /&gt;rattled. The product was replaced by the Prevage that is sold in department stores. Plus, there was only a small amount&lt;br /&gt;in the container. When it&#x27;s too good to be true. It is&lt;br /&gt;too good to be true!  Don&#x27;t bother.  I was taken advantage of.</li>
    <li> I really love it because it makes my skin smoother and natural looking unlike those foundation, it makes my face so unnatural.</li>
    <li> I experienced an allergic reaction to this product as well.  I normally use a retinol product so my skin is used to anitoxidants but I am unable to use this product because my skin reacts badly to it.  A lot of money wasted on a product that is unusable.</li>
    <li> Been using prevage md about 6 weeks skin is smoother but no help for wrinkles i expected more havent found anything that really works but ill keep looking.</li>
    <li> I have been using Prevage MD for nine years. I put it on as a moisturizer and apply my foundation over it and wash my face before I sleep and reapply prevage I am almost 60 but my skin is better than most 40 year old women. It has closed pores softened lines and given my skin elasticity that has helped prevent any plastic surgery.  I love this product and keep no less tan three at home so I never panic and run out. I have used many other $$$ products from Barney&#x27;s  and Neiman Marcus but nothing has performed like this. I get stopped in the cosmetic counters to be asked what I use. The best skin repaircibhave used ever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on for several years and am constantly amazed at how immediately it smooths and firms my skin.  It adds just a bit of a glow since it is a golden color when applied and immediately minimizes pores.  I constantly get compliments on my skin.  At 70 years of age that is quite amazing in its own right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using regular Prevage for a while, and figured I&#x27;d step up my routine by adding Prevage MD at night. Turned out to be a mistake. While the regular Elizabeth Arden Prevage is smooth, not unpleasant, and, I think, effective, this particular jar of Prevage MD was quite the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, it smells. Not just fragranced, but really, some kind of unpleasant odor. Nevertheless, I tried it, figuring that perhaps the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; grade formula just smelled different. That wasn&#x27;t the only thing that was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, leaning toward oily most of the year. After maybe two weeks of Prevage MD, my entire face was dry, peeling, and itchy. Worst of all, it was blotchy and puffy. I lathered on the moisturizer, but it wasn&#x27;t until a week after I stopped using Prevage MD that my skin returned to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use Prevage in the morning, Retin-A at night, and a moisturizer with each. My skin is much, much better. I am sorry I tried to cut corners, but I am also sorry I spent any money on this at all. I know each person&#x27;s skin and reactions are different, but I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> recommended by my dermatologist and smooths the skin.  It is great</li>
    <li> I have definitely noticed a difference since using this treatment. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought prevage from my dermatologist. I put it on my face and neck before I went to bed. I woke up with my entire face swollen. My eyes, in particular,  were so swollen I could barely see. My neck was red, hot  and itchy. Benedryl did not help reduce the pain and suffering. It lasted for three days. Horrible!   I have used many other anti-wrinkle products in the past, prescription and non-, without a bad reaction.  I would not even give it one star!!!</li>
    <li> i  got the product used it two times and the bottle is empty.what a rip off.i m very dissapointed with this seller.it was very expensive and i get only two uses</li>
    <li> Great and very prompt service!</li>
    <li> Two years ago, i was looking for a complete anti aging treatment, one that improve my skin, reduce winkles , and protect my skin from future signs of aging. I recommend Prevage.</li>
    <li> Prevage works. My skin looks much better when I use it and it is less dry. I have been using it for some time.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product for me.  I would throw away all makeup, cleansing products, and moisturizers just to use this one product.  It restores the Ph balance and normalizes and smooths my skin.  Well work the money.</li>
    <li> Best anti aging product on the market!!!! The exclusive Idibenone ingredient is patented and only available to this company!!! I have used it since it was launched  every day religiously and can not live without it!!!!</li>
    <li> My Prevage MD was delivered quickly and appeared exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Great product, improves the skin texture, very light</li>
</ol>
