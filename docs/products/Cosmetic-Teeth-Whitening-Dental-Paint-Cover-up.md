### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is great because I can whiten just one tooth at a time, or a pattern of teeth</li>
      <li>I cannot imagine someone finding this an attractive look.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on good, and it smells and tastes like you have toxins in your mouth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>teacher, so important that I look my best.</li>
      <li>It would be great if it came in shades to better match your teeth.</li>
      <li>The good news is, we have a healthy 15 pound baby girl.</li>
      <li>Goes off very easy,  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ll flash him a smile so bright it&#x27;ll make his head</li>
      <li>Spend your money on a better product.</li>
      <li>this is a waste of money, trust me lol, it doesnt cover good and comes off easy, i wouldnt get again</li>
      <li>This was not paint cover up, it was just a sample tooth whitening pen they must have received for free.</li>
      <li>But the customer service when I returned it was fantastic.</li>
      <li>and you cannot give a smooth coat on.  </li>
      <li>So I originally bought this by mistake, for my husband.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that they can gift wrap your order for cheap.</li>
      <li>the more the brush dries out and it is very clumpy.  </li>
      <li>Overall it is ok, better than having the stain show.  </li>
      <li>I had this one knucklehead, Ryan Westmoreland, who kept on making fun of my teeth.</li>
      <li>(I have a rare medical condition in which good news actually depletes melatonin)</li>
      <li>but they weren&#x27;t interested in letting me return product, even after I explained that product wasn&#x27;t useable.</li>
      <li>I had white veneer bonding over my teeth and now after so many years there is a slight discoloration, and they are not the bright glamourous white that they were.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many other types of paint I tried</li>
      <li>It also comes off pretty easily which was a major big deal for me.</li>
      <li>It takes several coats to cover, dries way to quickly to even apply.  </li>
      <li>Left my teeth with streaks, I think white out would work better.</li>
      <li>is good but not more, and you can&#x27;t eat, only drink.</li>
      <li>Long story short, I&#x27;m so glad I found Cosmetic Teeth</li>
      <li>This tooth paint is VERY white, too white for most teeth to look natural.  </li>
      <li>Normally, I let it roll off my back, real cool, but it was happening too much and the other kids were starting to look forward to it and join in.</li>
      <li>I hoped this would help with discoloration on a crown and although there was some extremely modest improvement, any chewing or licking of the front tooth wiped that out.</li>
      <li>Not very good looks like paint and chips off easily</li>
      <li>I have never rated a product before, butI was so excited at the concept of just painting your teeth white that I ignored previous reviews.  </li>
      <li>Not a strong color takes many coats but reaply every other day</li>
      <li>Barely goes on &amp; what does is all clumpy.  </li>
      <li>The bad news is, my teeth look AMAZING!</li>
      <li>I decided to buy the more expensive product and found it to be a colossal waste of $30.00.  </li>

<li> I decided to buy the more expensive product and found it to be a colossal waste of $30.00.  </li>
<li> First - they tend to whiten the teeth permanently, or semi-permanently at least.</li>
<li> And secondly, the way other products are designed, every tooth is whitened.</li>
<li> This is not as it is advertised, I have no idea if these other reviews received the same as I did, but this product is not a dental paint cover up.</li>
<li> If it doesn&#x27;t work for me, then I feel sorry for anyone with bad teeth ordering it and hoping for a nice smile.</li>
<li> This is not worth the money and only wish I had read reviews before purchasing.</li>
<li> I accidentally swallowed a couple teaspoons of Sherwin-Williams and I couldn&#x27;t keep solid foods down for a week.</li>
<li> The item I received was dried out and there were no specific instructions to use the thing.</li>
<li> I have used a few different teeth whitening systems</li>
<li> Paint on stuff of unknown chemical origin.  </li>
<li> Does not adhere to teeth as expected; looked like spotty nail polish; does not work</li>
<li> It aslo looked very fake, and peeled of easily.</li>
<li> This product was a complete failure,  it did nothing it promises.</li>
<li> (alternating, two-on two-off, etc) or any other combination.</li>
<li> The tube is very small, so 3 or 4 thin coats will run it out quick.</li>
<li> It was expensive and I was very disapointed in both product and seller.</li>
<li> It has the consistency of \\&quot;White Out\\&quot; (remember that stuff from typewriter days?), goes on sometimes thin, other times thick, \\&quot;chips\\&quot; off for no apparent reason, and gets all over your lips &amp; gums regardless of how carefully you apply it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other teeth whitening products, but I have a few qualms with them.</li>
<li> When I tried it, it was a mess.  </li>
<li> just wanted to put a little on one tooth.</li>
<li> It was a waste of money.</li>
<li> Is there any way I can receive at least a partial refund?  </li>
<li> It was a waste of my money.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> DON&#x27;T waste your money.</li>
<li> Not easy to apply or spread.</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t even cover a slight discoloration, only a bit if you apply at least 3 or 4 thin coats.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this!</li>
<li> It was a REAL MESS.</li>
<li> looks bad and highly noticeable</li>
<li> Big disappointment.</li>
<li> This product is an absolute, miserable and total FAIL.</li>
<li> Very hard to use on your bottom teeth.</li>
<li> I ordered this thinking it would be something I could do myself, but product was very thick and wasn&#x27;t anything I could use.</li>
<li> I was not happy with this product.</li>
<li> This was not a good buy at all!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product does not look natural and tastes awful. Waste of money. Not as advertised. Would definitely NOT recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This was not a good buy at all! There is no way you can wear this product on teeth it&#x27;s too white and leaves a wired taste in your mouth, not mention it chips off within ten minutes. This is not worth the money and only wish I had read reviews before purchasing. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I hoped this would help with discoloration on a crown and although there was some extremely modest improvement, any chewing or licking of the front tooth wiped that out. Nope - not the answer for me.</li>
    <li> This product was not even close to adhering to my tooth.  I decided to buy the more expensive product and found it to be a colossal waste of $30.00.  Is there any way I can receive at least a partial refund?  I did everything as per directions, and it was a disaster.</li>
    <li> Does not adhere to teeth as expected; looked like spotty nail polish; does not work</li>
    <li> But the customer service when I returned it was fantastic. (Not Amazon&#x27;s customer service.)  The whitening solution is clumpy. It does not apply evenly, and you have to apply several coats. So you are left with an unnatural, discolored, film on your teeth that will not last. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use. You have to do all teeth and it looks totally fake. I do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> So I originally bought this by mistake, for my husband. He asked me for \\&quot;Heinekin\\&quot; and I got this instead (what can I say - baby brain!!!). The good news is, we have a healthy 15 pound baby girl. The bad news is, my teeth look AMAZING! (I have a rare medical condition in which good news actually depletes melatonin)</li>
    <li> The teeth paint tasted toxic, like that used to paint walls. It aslo looked very fake, and peeled of easily. I cannot imagine someone finding this an attractive look. The taste was very bad. I asked for the return info the next day...</li>
    <li> This tooth paint is VERY white, too white for most teeth to look natural.  Overall it is ok, better than having the stain show.  It would be great if it came in shades to better match your teeth.</li>
    <li> Not very good looks like paint and chips off easily, wouldn&#x27;t recommend doesn&#x27;t work at all looks bad and highly noticeable</li>
    <li> Streaks and does not cover up fillings as it states it does! It also comes off pretty easily which was a major big deal for me. I was not happy with this product. I&#x27;d recommend you save your money and find another solution....</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. It did nothing as promised. The item I received was dried out and there were no specific instructions to use the thing. It was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Not a strong color takes many coats but reaply every other day</li>
    <li> The product just does not work. Goes on in globs and looks artifical. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Phys. Ed. teacher, so important that I look my best. I had this one knucklehead, Ryan Westmoreland, who kept on making fun of my teeth. Normally, I let it roll off my back, real cool, but it was happening too much and the other kids were starting to look forward to it and join in. Long story short, I&#x27;m so glad I found Cosmetic Teeth Whitening Dental Paint Cover-Up. I can&#x27;t tell you how many other types of paint I tried before I found this stuff. Some were too runny. Some were too streaky. I accidentally swallowed a couple teaspoons of Sherwin-Williams and I couldn&#x27;t keep solid foods down for a week. It was a REAL MESS. (Like I said, I&#x27;m a Phys Ed. teacher, so you can understand why that&#x27;s a problem.) Next time Ryan Westmoreland asks me if I&#x27;ve been eating dog t*rds, I&#x27;ll flash him a smile so bright it&#x27;ll make his head spin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that they can gift wrap your order for cheap. I&#x27;m getting some for my Grandma. She lives alone, so...</li>
    <li> This is garbage.  It doesn&#x27;t go on good, and it smells and tastes like you have toxins in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT recommend</li>
    <li> This product is a joke.  It has the consistency of \\&quot;White Out\\&quot; (remember that stuff from typewriter days?), goes on sometimes thin, other times thick, \\&quot;chips\\&quot; off for no apparent reason, and gets all over your lips &amp; gums regardless of how carefully you apply it.  DON&#x27;T waste your money.</li>
    <li> Paint on stuff of unknown chemical origin.  Does not go on even and flakes off almost immediately.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with this!</li>
    <li> this is a waste of money, trust me lol, it doesnt cover good and comes off easy, i wouldnt get again</li>
    <li> just wanted to put a little on one tooth. To brite and to white. Not easy to apply or spread. Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is an absolute, miserable and total FAIL. Buyers beware. White-Out works as well and is and a lot cheaper. Don&#x27;t waste money or time on this crap.</li>
    <li> I had white veneer bonding over my teeth and now after so many years there is a slight discoloration, and they are not the bright glamourous white that they were. This product stated it would cover silver in your mouth....doesn&#x27;t even cover a slight discoloration, only a bit if you apply at least 3 or 4 thin coats. The tube is very small, so 3 or 4 thin coats will run it out quick. Very hard to use on your bottom teeth. Very disappointed with this product. If it doesn&#x27;t work for me, then I feel sorry for anyone with bad teeth ordering it and hoping for a nice smile. Spend your money on a better product.</li>
    <li> Coulda bought 8 of the same thing @ Walmart for what I paid for this ONE &amp; all this pen DIDN&#x27;T but claimed to do.</li>
    <li> I tried couple times to put it on , but did&#x27;t work for me. Goes off very easy,  may be just for an hour is good but not more, and you can&#x27;t eat, only drink.</li>
    <li> This product does not work.  Barely goes on &amp; what does is all clumpy.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on it!</li>
    <li> I do not know what to say, I bought it but not for myself</li>
    <li> This product was a complete failure,  it did nothing it promises. Left my teeth with streaks, I think white out would work better.</li>
    <li> This is not as it is advertised, I have no idea if these other reviews received the same as I did, but this product is not a dental paint cover up. I have used a few different teeth whitening systems but I was looking for dental enamel paint not another whitening system. I wanted for a wedding and paid extra for 2 day express shipping. I paid $29 for express shipping and the product came priority, which is $5.95. I would not have paid $29 if it stated it was priority mail, it stated 2 day expedited shipping. This was not paint cover up, it was just a sample tooth whitening pen they must have received for free. The seller said they would take back if not used and I didn&#x27;t, I saw what it was as soon as I opened the package. They would not do anything with the shipping cost. We all want to make money but you don&#x27;t deceive customers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other teeth whitening products, but I have a few qualms with them. First - they tend to whiten the teeth permanently, or semi-permanently at least. And secondly, the way other products are designed, every tooth is whitened. This product is great because I can whiten just one tooth at a time, or a pattern of teeth (alternating, two-on two-off, etc) or any other combination.</li>
    <li> I have never rated a product before, butI was so excited at the concept of just painting your teeth white that I ignored previous reviews.  When I tried it, it was a mess.  It takes several coats to cover, dries way to quickly to even apply.  While you paint a tooth it starts clumping and you cannot give a smooth coat on.  The farther into the process the more the brush dries out and it is very clumpy.  Second thing is that it&#x27;s so white you look unreal.  I thought well I think I only paid about $10-12, but when I check it was $29.00 that I paid not counting s/h.  Big disappointment.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it would be something I could do myself, but product was very thick and wasn&#x27;t anything I could use. When I contacted seller, they were polite..but they weren&#x27;t interested in letting me return product, even after I explained that product wasn&#x27;t useable. It was expensive and I was very disapointed in both product and seller.</li>
    <li> this product did not meet my expectations.</li>
