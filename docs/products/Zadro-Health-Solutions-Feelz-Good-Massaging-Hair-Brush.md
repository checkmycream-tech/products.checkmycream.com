      <li>The quality is good although on touching it may not feel a great quality product</li>
      <li>also find this useful because my pets (dog and cats) aren&#x27;t very good when it comes to the days I have to brush them.</li>
      <li>My HAIR did not grow at all, but it DID get very tangled in the bristles and I lost even more hair!!!.  </li>
      <li>Brush has 2 vibration settings - strong and very strong!</li>
      <li>But can&#x27;t expect more for $6 ..... .... ...</li>
      <li>whats  not to  love?</li>

      <li>Overall very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Very cheap quality and light plastic.</li>
      <li>the feelz Good looked very faded out also</li>
      <li>What a cool feeling!</li>
      <li>came quickly,  easy to add batteries,  </li>
      <li>He was happy to find this one after his last one died after many years of service.</li>
      <li>My cousin bought one of these and kept saying how much she liked it.</li>
      <li>I got an extra one of these for my pets, and without even caring about the noise one of my cats absolutely loved</li>
      <li>do have one suggestion (which is true with every brush)</li>
      <li>Too much vibration on my head maybe for your back it would be good but not MY head</li>
      <li>The lower one is relaxing and higher is a bit powerful</li>
      <li>But do NOT run it through your hair if you have any kind of long hair.  </li>
      <li>-- it&#x27;s a fun, gentle massage.</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>Luckily, if you can get creative you can find other uses for this &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>gentle or more vigor as desired...  used daily.  </li>
      <li>It should not be so easy to open the battery compartment door unless you want to change the batteries.</li>
      <li>Who knew I really needed a massaging hair brush?</li>
      <li>really like this brush.</li>
      <li>So I cannot say if it really worked for me or not.  </li>
      <li>Really gets the scalp tingling.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this product, works very well</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised at how powerful it is.</li>
      <li>1st hairbrush I received was a little stiffer, better quality, but accidentally dropped it and broke.  </li>
      <li>Even arrived early.</li>
      <li>But it feels good on my psorasis that I have on my scalp unfortunately.</li>
      <li>Since my hair is too kinky to brush, I use the flat side of the brush and it really does stimulate.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t use it regularly enough to know if it would really help my hair grow, but overall I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
      <li>I also like how it gives a massage feeling on the back of the brush (the grey part), so not only is it useful for your scalp but with the grey part it is useful for other body parts.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know how long this product will last, though.</li>
<li> The only problem I have is when you&#x27;re brushing your hair you need to be careful where you place your hand because the battery compartment door will slide open.  </li>
<li> I suffer from frequent headaches, and there have been a few times where I used this brush on different pressure points on my head and neck, and it brought some relief.&lt;br</li>
<li> 2nd hairbrush I had ordered looked like it was used, not very stiff,the letters  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had it long</li>
<li> bought it to replace a less sturdy one that finally (after less than a year) broke completely to pieces.  </li>
<li> I got this after reading a book that claimed scalp massage via brushing or motorized scalp massagers or human hands can help the circulation of you scalp which is supposed to stimulate hair growth to areas where people may be experiencing hair thinning due to age, hormones, or from whatever.  </li>
<li> (I wait til mine is fully dry).</li>
<li> The first brush was not packaged correctly and therefore arrived with a number of broken bristles.</li>
<li> Works as well if not better than a more expensive product.</li>
<li> Some reviewers note that it is not gentle, but that is not my experience.  </li>
<li> ; due to what I&#x27;ve seen on some reviews, don&#x27;t use it when your hair is wet</li>
<li> It has massaging beads on the other side.</li>
<li> my wife has tender scalp and can&#x27;t stand sharp bristles</li>
<li> I have also found that I can brush my hair while wet with this brush -- as long as you move slowly, with the vibrations of the brush, it seems to work well to de-tangle.</li>
<li> my hair  is down to my waist.  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t affect performance, just made me think I should put it down and let it rest.</li>
<li> Sounds a little odd.</li>
<li> very loose bristles,  not very good quality does not do any thing for me.  </li>
<li> The brush is little bit harsh on the scalp.</li>
<li> I got this product,i am not satisfied with the package in which the hair brush bristles were broken in the middle of the brush.</li>
<li> I have done A LOT of research on what&#x27;s good and bad for your hair (cause I&#x27;m trying to grow mine out again) and brushing it when its wet is bad for it!</li>
<li> -- I use it at least a few times a day.</li>
<li> should buy a second one use this like crazy</li>
<li> It is a little noisy but its not that bad</li>
<li> you&#x27;ll be sorry you did.</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t too expensive.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this product,i am not satisfied with the package in which the hair brush bristles were broken in the middle of the brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my cat and she loves it. She doesn&#x27;t like to be brushed by any cat brush therefore I purchased this brush for her and it&#x27;s like giving her a massage. If you want to make your pet happy brush her fur with this brush.</li>
    <li> i am very happy with your product,keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> What a cool feeling! I suffer from frequent headaches, and there have been a few times where I used this brush on different pressure points on my head and neck, and it brought some relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this brush. I haven&#x27;t had it long and I don&#x27;t use it regularly enough to know if it would really help my hair grow, but overall I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product for the price. The brush is good and massages my scalp while brushing. Happy about the purchase.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to buy a massaging brush because what woman needs a vibrating brush? Sounds a little odd. But it feels good on my psorasis that I have on my scalp unfortunately.</li>
    <li> My cousin bought one of these and kept saying how much she liked it. I have to agree -- it&#x27;s a fun, gentle massage. Some reviewers note that it is not gentle, but that is not my experience.  I find it very nice.  I have also found that I can brush my hair while wet with this brush -- as long as you move slowly, with the vibrations of the brush, it seems to work well to de-tangle. I&#x27;ve had mine for several months and haven&#x27;t replaced batteries yet -- I use it at least a few times a day. Who knew I really needed a massaging hair brush? ;-)</li>
    <li> I do like the massage brush. The only problem I have is when you&#x27;re brushing your hair you need to be careful where you place your hand because the battery compartment door will slide open.  It should not be so easy to open the battery compartment door unless you want to change the batteries.</li>
    <li> I did not resived the latear wallet cover</li>
    <li> my hair  is down to my waist.  it  got that  long over a few years of  using  olive  oil VERY sparingly in my hair  coupled with the  use  of  one of these brushes!  truly helps stimulate your  scalp to get the hair growing.  GREAT  product at an  awesome price! whats  not to  love?</li>
    <li> 1st hairbrush I received was a little stiffer, better quality, but accidentally dropped it and broke.  So I cannot say if it really worked for me or not.  2nd hairbrush I had ordered looked like it was used, not very stiff,the letters  the feelz Good looked very faded out also very loose bristles,  not very good quality does not do any thing for me.  But if I had received a brush like the 1st one , perhaps I  would know if it works for me or not..</li>
    <li> Just got this product used it once and it would not come back on.</li>
    <li> gentle or more vigor as desired...  used daily.  My wife says she loves it.  bought it to replace a less sturdy one that finally (after less than a year) broke completely to pieces.  Dropped one last time crunch...&lt;br /&gt;This came quickly,  easy to add batteries,  very handy...  my wife has tender scalp and can&#x27;t stand sharp bristles (this does not have any)&lt;br /&gt;to reemphasize my wife loves it.  good price too make it even \\&quot;better\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Nightmare!!! 2 purchase 2 return !! Never work!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great reasonably priced vibrating brush.  I have ordered 2 more as gifts.  Would recommend this product, works very well</li>
    <li> Very happy, thank you.</li>
    <li> This massaging brush stands out because it has dual speeds. More impressive is the company. The first brush was not packaged correctly and therefore arrived with a number of broken bristles. Zadro Health shipped another one immediatly with no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great transaction.</li>
    <li> This feels great on my scalp. I also like how it gives a massage feeling on the back of the brush (the grey part), so not only is it useful for your scalp but with the grey part it is useful for other body parts. It is a little noisy but its not that bad (It sounds like a mechanical toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;I also find this useful because my pets (dog and cats) aren&#x27;t very good when it comes to the days I have to brush them. I got an extra one of these for my pets, and without even caring about the noise one of my cats absolutely loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I do have one suggestion (which is true with every brush); due to what I&#x27;ve seen on some reviews, don&#x27;t use it when your hair is wet (I wait til mine is fully dry). I have done A LOT of research on what&#x27;s good and bad for your hair (cause I&#x27;m trying to grow mine out again) and brushing it when its wet is bad for it!</li>
    <li> This brush has two settings which is great if you want it to be gentle or all more pressure. It has massaging beads on the other side. I do it every night. I think it will help stimulate my hair follicle.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I remember having a glass electric rake that was used on my scalp as a child.  I couldn&#x27;t find one that was inexpensive, so I just wanted to find something that would stimulate my scalp in the areas that are thinner. It wasn&#x27;t too expensive.  Since my hair is too kinky to brush, I use the flat side of the brush and it really does stimulate.  It also helps that there are two speeds for the vibration. I don&#x27;t know how long this product will last, though. After a 10 minutes, I could smell something that I imagine was coming from the motor.  It didn&#x27;t affect performance, just made me think I should put it down and let it rest.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised at how powerful it is. Works as well if not better than a more expensive product. Really gets the scalp tingling. I like the fact it has 2 speeds. Works great on the massage side for getting the kinks out of the neck</li>
    <li> My husband loves his electric brush. He swears the brush stimulates his hair follicles allowing him to keep his hair. He was happy to find this one after his last one died after many years of service.</li>
    <li> Very cheap quality and light plastic. Vibrations are good but noisy.  But can&#x27;t expect more for $6 ..... .... ...</li>
    <li> The brush is little bit harsh on the scalp.</li>
    <li> These brushes have been a gift for multi-handicapped girl. She loves them.</li>
    <li> Even arrived early. Product was as described - good quality. Price was good. Service was prompt. Would definitely purchase again! Brush has 2 vibration settings - strong and very strong! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of my aunt&#x27;s Christmas gift this year. She always loves when people play with her hair because it&#x27;s relaxing. When I saw this brush, I just knew I had to get it for her! She said it works great and feels really good on her head. I havent gotten to try it out yet but hope to sometime!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Feelz good&amp;#34; massaging brush. Good lord, I should have known by the name but I just didn&#x27;t pay any attention to this until I got it home and turned it on.  Call it what it is.......a vibrator!!  I got this after reading a book that claimed scalp massage via brushing or motorized scalp massagers or human hands can help the circulation of you scalp which is supposed to stimulate hair growth to areas where people may be experiencing hair thinning due to age, hormones, or from whatever.  I turned this brush on and just laughed.  MY husband and I both laughed.  Trust me, it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; massager.  Not for the scalp.  My HAIR did not grow at all, but it DID get very tangled in the bristles and I lost even more hair!!!.  Luckily, if you can get creative you can find other uses for this &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;.  But do NOT run it through your hair if you have any kind of long hair.  you&#x27;ll be sorry you did.</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase  should buy a second one use this like crazy</li>
    <li> Too much vibration on my head maybe for your back it would be good but not MY head it made my head red !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since January 2013 now and use it every week. The quality is good although on touching it may not feel a great quality product but this works as promised. There are two levels of vibrations. The lower one is relaxing and higher is a bit powerful which is good. Not a battery eater i suppose. Overall very happy with the product.</li>
