      <li>By far the best value for this vintage classic soap.</li>
      <li>It has a clean smell, rinses cleanly and lasts forever!</li>
      <li>new formula, however, is an adequate approximation to what many of us remember, and is pleasant enough to use even though &amp;#34;the original&amp;#34; formula was superior.</li>
      <li>The descriptions I&#x27;ve read mentioned a light citrus scent.  </li>

      <li>It smells so clean</li>

      <li>would come out of the shower smelling like a 1912 millionaire tycoon , cool and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I got some for my wife and she enjoyed it so much.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how quickly they processed and shipped my order.  </li>
      <li>If it was good enough for the first class on the Titanic it is good enough for me!  </li>
      <li>Gentle and effective even for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>One day, there will not be a person left on the face of the earth who knows what nice things are.</li>
      <li>its worth the price</li>
      <li>When I am ready to order more of this soap (which I most certainly will) I will order from the same company.  </li>
      <li>It produces a luxurious rich creamy lather and has an old fashioned clean scent.</li>
      <li>Worth the price for a first class soap.</li>
      <li>this to the incredibly long list of nice things people cannot have anymore.</li>
      <li>This is a very high quality product that is difficult to find in my area, so I am happy to be able to order it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>THE STATESIDE FOLKS SENT THE CORRECT SOAP FIRST..</li>
      <li>I first bought this soap at a traveling Titanic exhibit as a souvenir.</li>
      <li>First, thank you Carbolic Soap Co</li>
      <li>and I keep coming back for more..</li>
      <li>I LOVE soap, buy big bars and unwrap them to put in pajama and lingerie drawers plus put them in closet with linens.  </li>
      <li>It may or may not have been used on the White Star Line ships but glad to have it today anyway.</li>
      <li>Unlike the other customer here, I love this soap and don&#x27;t like to go without!  </li>
      <li>I first discovered it at a Titanic gift shop.  </li>
      <li>It smells clean, It rinses off completely.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is terrific, but the product is only good and for the price...terrible.</li>
      <li>-- but it was very close.  </li>
      <li>; is still pleasant on the skin with a recognizable fragrance and the last six ingredients added to approximate the original cleansing experience.</li>
      <li>The only similarity between this soap and the original is the packaging.</li>
      <li>The original formula contained the following:  Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Cocoate, Aqua, Glycerol, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Tetrosodium EDTA, Etidronice Acid, Boracic Acid.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several years and just love it especially in the winter months.  </li>
      <li>This formula probably was not exactly what was available on The Titanic -- note the Tetrosodium EDTA?</li>
      <li>This new rendering of &amp;#34;the original&amp;#34</li>
      <li>First off this product is not even a shadow of it&#x27;s former self.</li>
      <li>Mine stays soft and supple!  </li>
      <li>After all, it had been offered to the first class passengers on Titanic as an extra luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Again, the formulation that some of us enjoyed, although closer to the original and containing Etidronice Acid and Boracic Acid as gentle exfoliants along with cold cream ingredients to help cleanse and moisturize, was probably not the exact ingredient listing of the soap back in 1912.  </li>
      <li>I remember these from my trip on the old Queen Elizabeth in 1956.  </li>
      <li>It does well on my face, and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I feel clean afterwards, and I like the heavy scent myself.  </li>
      <li>Because of the cost, I only use it on my face and have had NO trouble at all.  </li>
      <li>Just tells you how long lasting the old soap was too, without the tetra-sodium EDTA that&#x27;s in the new version.</li>
      <li>This unctuous and luxurious soap smells exactly as I remember it over half a century ago.</li>
      <li>Does not dry my skin at all.</li>
      <li>There are plenty of much less expensive soaps out there that are equally as good.  </li>

<li> I gave a bar to a girlfriend who previously used Dove because she has very dry skin.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s HEAVY on citronella instead of the truer citrus scent that went with the otto rose base.</li>
<li> After daily use of at least a shower or two a day, I&#x27;d say it lasted about three weeks to a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> So what if it ruins the product, it saved his job.</li>
<li> Vinolia is now just a glob of saponified Crisco with some mosquito repellent thrown in after a sneeze of synthetic rose oil.    </li>
<li> /&gt;Indeed it is a little pricey for a bar of soap, but it lasted a lot longer than I would have predicted it to.</li>
<li> The main disappointment though is the way it feels now - thinner, less creamy.  </li>
<li> , what&#x27;s the next &amp;#34;nice thing&amp;#34; we can make extinct. .............</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad, too, another quality product down the tubes!</li>
<li> Gone are the cold cream properties.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Picked this up after my mother, my aunt, and I visited the Titanic Museum in Pigeon Forge.  The descriptions I&#x27;ve read mentioned a light citrus scent.  Unfortunately, it smells a bit like bug spray to me.  :(</li>
    <li> I LOVE soap, buy big bars and unwrap them to put in pajama and lingerie drawers plus put them in closet with linens.  This is the cream of the bar soap crop.  Nothing better on earth but to get in a hot tub and lather up.  Heaven!</li>
    <li> First, thank you Carbolic Soap Co you shipped extremely fast and I am very pleased with your service and this review is in no way a reflection on you as you are not the manufacturer of the soap.    First off this product is not even a shadow of it&#x27;s former self. It&#x27;s been entirely reformulated to the politically correct junk grade veggie oil base that every other wimp manufacturer has turned their once fine soaps into. The scent is not the original scent either though it&#x27;s reminiscent enough to approximate what it was. It&#x27;s HEAVY on citronella instead of the truer citrus scent that went with the otto rose base. Also the scent is not as prominent as the original. Gone are the cold cream properties. Gone is the boric acid in the original.     No passenger on the Titanic used anything like this, they used the finest grade A soap made from the finest tallow (animal fat) and coconut oil. That&#x27;s what grade A soap is made out of and it&#x27;s the finest and mildest form of soap known to man. It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin like this present excuse for Vinolia does. Vinolia is now just a glob of saponified Crisco with some mosquito repellent thrown in after a sneeze of synthetic rose oil.    Stay away from it.</li>
    <li> If it was good enough for the first class on the Titanic it is good enough for me!  Feels very rich and leaves my skin feeling soft and wonderful.  Does not dry my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Unlike the other customer here, I love this soap and don&#x27;t like to go without!  It does well on my face, and I have sensitive skin.  I feel clean afterwards, and I like the heavy scent myself.  Because of the cost, I only use it on my face and have had NO trouble at all.  I am happy to be able to buy it here on Amazon! Thank You!</li>
    <li> The Titanic story was the glitz and the lure.  Tryed it and find it to be a luxury soap and nice for the skin.  Ordered some more</li>
    <li> I love the scent of lemon, and have used this product for years. It&#x27;s always been a real favorite of mine.</li>
    <li> There are plenty of much less expensive soaps out there that are equally as good.  The packaging is terrific, but the product is only good and for the price...terrible.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful soap.  It smells so clean and it really does a good job!  Nice and rich lather, and I love the Titanic design on the boxes.  When I am ready to order more of this soap (which I most certainly will) I will order from the same company.  I can&#x27;t believe how quickly they processed and shipped my order.  I received it two days after I ordered it!</li>
    <li> This is the best bar soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It produces a luxurious rich creamy lather and has an old fashioned clean scent. The bars last twice as long as ordinary supermarket bars. Gentle and effective even for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My father used to use this soap as I was growing up. It has a distinctive fragrance that conveys both cleanliness and luxury, without being too aggressive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several years and just love it especially in the winter months.  You know how you skin gets flakey in the winter...not with this soap.  Mine stays soft and supple!  Give this product an A+.</li>
    <li> Fabulous soap! We keep a supply on hand for our use as well as for guests. It may or may not have been used on the White Star Line ships but glad to have it today anyway.</li>
    <li> My wife is a Titantic fan and had to have it. We saw the soap in Vegas at the exhibit.</li>
    <li> The best soap in the world.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Quite to my expectations.</li>
    <li> My mother grew up in Trepassy Newfoundland and used this soap. It has a clean smell, rinses cleanly and lasts forever! When she came to the states she brought this with her and always got a \\&quot;care package\\&quot; to keep her supplied. The kids got lifebouy or ivory...but Mom ...she got the Vinolia. I got some for my wife and she enjoyed it so much. We ordered from this company and got great service and prices delivered to our door. Please USE the STATESIDE folks...as the brits do not seem to understand the lingo...we ordered and paid for one thing..got something else. THE STATESIDE FOLKS SENT THE CORRECT SOAP FIRST..THEN PAID FOR THE RETURN OF THE SOAP SENT IN ERROR FROM THE BRITS. THEY NOW HAVE OUR BUSINESS FOR LIFE!</li>
    <li> The only similarity between this soap and the original is the packaging. It&#x27;s like finding potassium chloride in a Morton Salt box.  The fragrance is completely different.  In fact I still have a nubbin of a bar from the eighties and the wonderful scent is still there.  Just tells you how long lasting the old soap was too, without the tetra-sodium EDTA that&#x27;s in the new version. The main disappointment though is the way it feels now - thinner, less creamy.  It&#x27;s too bad, too, another quality product down the tubes!</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality product that is difficult to find in my area, so I am happy to be able to order it from Amazon. Thank you.</li>
    <li> and long-lasting, too!  I buy this every Christmas for a friend who hadn&#x27;t been able to locate the brand for many years.</li>
    <li> I first bought this soap at a traveling Titanic exhibit as a souvenir. I absolutely loved the way it smelled.. so it only lasted in the box a few weeks before I finally decided I had to try it and see what all the fuss was about. After all, it had been offered to the first class passengers on Titanic as an extra luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed it is a little pricey for a bar of soap, but it lasted a lot longer than I would have predicted it to. After daily use of at least a shower or two a day, I&#x27;d say it lasted about three weeks to a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would come out of the shower smelling like a 1912 millionaire tycoon , cool and refreshed. It does not over dry the skin nor does it clog the pores, whereas I would have a problem with it because I have sensitive skin and usually just buy hypo allergenic soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is great and I keep coming back for more.. its worth the price and I would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about trying it. Try it... You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This thing smells really nice!</li>
    <li> When I was a boy, anytime something nice around the house got ruined, my mother would say quietly, &amp;#34;We just can&#x27;t have nice things.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add this to the incredibly long list of nice things people cannot have anymore. One day, there will not be a person left on the face of the earth who knows what nice things are. We&#x27;re almost there, but not quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody falls for corporate&#x27;s canned answers of how &amp;#34;this is what the majority polled wanted&amp;#34;. They&#x27;re just following more bad form by insinuating it is the consumer&#x27;s fault by making such statements. Pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it&#x27;s just another corporate puppet, terrified of loosing his job by doing it truly well, so he sets out to do what is commonly expected of him: save every penny possible with no regard for product, customer, or integrity or no bonus, vacation, or promotion for him. Cut all the good stuff out of the product since that is what costs them the most money. So what if it ruins the product, it saved his job. Pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, what&#x27;s the next &amp;#34;nice thing&amp;#34; we can make extinct. .............</li>
    <li> great ... doesn&#x27;t even feel like soap!!</li>
    <li> This soap is incredible.  I first discovered it at a Titanic gift shop.  It smells clean, It rinses off completely.  I gave a bar to a girlfriend who previously used Dove because she has very dry skin.  She loves this soap and now chooses it over Dove.</li>
    <li> While the formula is NOT the original formula from the Titanic, it&#x27;s still a fantastic soap. Still MUCH BETTER than detergent bars from box stores.</li>
    <li> The formula for Vinolia Soap changed around 2008-2009 when the soap was acquired by Unilever.  The box read &amp;#34;The Original VINOLIA Boracic &amp; Cold Cream Soap&amp;#34;.  The original formula contained the following:  Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Cocoate, Aqua, Glycerol, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Tetrosodium EDTA, Etidronice Acid, Boracic Acid.  This formula probably was not exactly what was available on The Titanic -- note the Tetrosodium EDTA? -- but it was very close.  Even the back of the soap box was different.  It displayed a British royal insignia and no picture of The Titanic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare the above formula with what is currently Vinolia Soap:  Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palm Kemelate, Aqua, Glycerin, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Citral, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool.  The color of the bar is slightly different, it is not as creamy, and it does not sudse up as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new formula, however, is an adequate approximation to what many of us remember, and is pleasant enough to use even though &amp;#34;the original&amp;#34; formula was superior. (Limonene ingredient in the updated soap may even have some health benefits.) Again, the formulation that some of us enjoyed, although closer to the original and containing Etidronice Acid and Boracic Acid as gentle exfoliants along with cold cream ingredients to help cleanse and moisturize, was probably not the exact ingredient listing of the soap back in 1912.  Time makes changes for whatever reasons.  This new rendering of &amp;#34;the original&amp;#34; is still pleasant on the skin with a recognizable fragrance and the last six ingredients added to approximate the original cleansing experience.</li>
    <li> By far the best value for this vintage classic soap. This unctuous and luxurious soap smells exactly as I remember it over half a century ago. It is an indulgence that doubles as Aromatherapy. I just love it!</li>
    <li> I had heard of a washing technique for your face where you use &amp;#34;hard milled soap&amp;#34;.  I found these and have tried them and cannot say enough good about them.  Smell wonderful, last forever, clean very well, and my face looks better and stays more smooth.</li>
    <li> I remember these from my trip on the old Queen Elizabeth in 1956.  Used to be standard issue for all Cunard ships</li>
    <li> Best soap we have ever found, across a bar by chance and have stayed with it since. Worth the price for a first class soap.</li>
