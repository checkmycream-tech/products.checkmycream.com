<li> You can take on a plane as long as you only take one butane cartridge.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using an older version for at least 6 to 8 years and it finally needed to be replaced.</li>
<li> I have extremely long hair</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very convenient to pop into a purse and head out the door, but the barrel is so small that the curls it produces are less than fashionable.  </li>
<li> but if I wrap it tightly around without using the barrel clip I can just about wrap an entire section of the longest parts.</li>
<li> I will never know if the curling iron worked, because two sets of cartridges (4 total) were defective!!&lt;br /&gt;Money wasted and not able to curl my hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had a few cordless curling irons over the years</li>
<li> It took quite a few button pushes to get it to start heating up.</li>
<li> I found it to be too small even for touch-ups.  </li>
<li> so I have to use small sections</li>
<li> Too hard for self use.</li>
<li> Not too bad in propane use.</li>

    <li> It took quite a few button pushes to get it to start heating up. It didn&#x27;t seem to get very hot. It&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it, LOVE it.....Perfect..fits right in my purse, easy to use and makes your hair look good!</li>
    <li> Too small and gets too hot. Too hard for self use. Easy to burn your scalp. I do not like it.</li>
    <li> Thank You Great trade</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun one since 1999 but can&#x27;t find butane refills to fit mine.  I love mine and how convenient it is to use and you don&#x27;t have to stand in one place.  Great for when I traveled.</li>
    <li> Very convenient  because it is cordless.  I have one at home, at the office and in my travel case.  Lightweight and good for about 2 months on one ThermaCell.</li>
    <li> 5/8&amp;#34; barrel is the size I wanted. Nice and compact. It is air travel approved if you replace the cap on the ThermaCell</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, I had one for 17 years and now got a new one, Easy use&lt;br /&gt;Great results&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few cordless curling irons over the years (I have 3 right now) and this one is my current favorite. It heats up very fast and gets very hot. I have extremely long hair and this is pretty small so it takes about 45 minutes for me to curl all of my hair with this. My hair is still kind of finicky about holding a curl even after a perm so I have to use small sections but if I wrap it tightly around without using the barrel clip I can just about wrap an entire section of the longest parts.</li>
    <li> This is not an item I would use daily, but when I travel or run out of the house and need to do touchups, it is GREAT!</li>
    <li> BEST THING EVERRRR!!!..Ive already used it three times after being on a motorcycle....lol...then beach days!..Thing works GREAT!!..and I have a LOT of hair..;)</li>
    <li> Good product, good service,</li>
    <li> great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> It goes through the fuel fast and doesn&#x27;t do as good as a plug-in curling iron, but it works if you have no electricity.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t get it to function, want to send it back, and can&#x27;t find my receipt!!!  what to do?  is it possible?</li>
    <li> I was surprised at just how compact this mini curling iron is.  It&#x27;s very convenient to pop into a purse and head out the door, but the barrel is so small that the curls it produces are less than fashionable.  I found it to be too small even for touch-ups.  It also didn&#x27;t seem to heat up very well.</li>
    <li> Well, I think if I did it over again, I would have bought the larger barrel iron. But; I really would not put the one I bought down. Since we cruise&lt;br /&gt;a lot, I don&#x27;t have to bring a extra adapter. To me, anyone of them is really GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I have additional products like it&lt;br /&gt; Its the best thing especially when traveling or need a touch up any where</li>
    <li> Terrific curling iron.  Love not having a cord.  You can take on a plane as long as you only take one butane cartridge.</li>
    <li> Works good! Heats up fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older version for at least 6 to 8 years and it finally needed to be replaced. I like this version because it doesn&#x27;t require electricity, it easily travels in its own case and can fit in my SMALL purse. Mh hair is short, too, so its the perfect size. Would I recommend it...absolutely! And it heats up and cools down quickly.</li>
    <li> I will never know if the curling iron worked, because two sets of cartridges (4 total) were defective!!&lt;br /&gt;Money wasted and not able to curl my hair.  I would not recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Works really well. Have had several of these. I just wear them out. Works well on med short hair. Like the brush attachment. Not too bad in propane use. Very convenient!!</li>
    <li> does the job..often lose power and it is a lifesaver</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for years and I needed a new one.</li>
    <li> Bought two and gave them as gifts to co-workers, have had one myself for many years. The ladies both said I could not have given them a better gift. I sure felt good about that and am happy I was able to find them on Amazon. Thank you Amazon</li>
