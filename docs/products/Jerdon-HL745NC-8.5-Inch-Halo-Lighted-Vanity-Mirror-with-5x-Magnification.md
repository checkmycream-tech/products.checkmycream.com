      <li>It sure is pretty, setting on my dressing table..</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t bright enough to light shaded areas of my face when I applied makeup.</li>

      <li>I would certainly recommend the product, just be sure you have adequate room lighting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent mirror!  Really help me see what I am doing. Nice finish and weight as well.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for  my wife...we were vacationing in Mexico and the unit had one of these.  She loves it and uses it every day.</li>
    <li> If you want to look nice for candle light this would be the mirror - other than that the light is way too dim. Very disappointed. My husband already threw away the box otherwise I would have returne it!!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful mirror with perfect lighting and no distortion. It also looks very nice on my vanity.  Just what I was looking for.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> If you want to see your face while putting on make up I would not suggest  this iem.  The mirror itself is about 6 1/2\\&quot;.  If Women like to put their make up and check th entire face while doing so,  this is not the mirror to purchase.  Very dissatisfyed with mirror size</li>
    <li> Jerdon HL745NC 5X Magnification Two Sided Lighted Mirror     Those days of being ashamed of my facial hair..... gone!  Woo hoo! For all you out there with astigmatism, you know that seeing up close is a problem without your glasses.  Well, this little item will have paid for itself in a few short weeks.  No more waxing at the salon.  No more tips!  Do yourself a favor and purchase this.  It&#x27;s beautiful enough to leave out on your bathrom counter top and practical as all get out.</li>
    <li> The mirror developed a small crack within two months of use. I contacted the manufacturer and received a brief dismissing response indicating that they will not honor any warranty. The have also not responded to my follow up email.  Unhappy and disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror since 2009 and I think the light worked for maybe 3 months?? I use it only for the mirror.  I would not purchase it again. It is kind of bulky and takes up a bunch of room on my vanity. The 5x size works well. The color is nice and will blend into a lot of different rooms.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a lighted mirror to use when he was shaving. I bought him a more powerful mirror and it was just too much. He would have to put his face almost againt the mirror to be able to see. We returned that mirror and purchased this one.  We have been very happy with this mirror.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that the light wasn&#x27;t brighter.  There are no directions or inserts in box, so not sure how to get at bulb or if a brighter one can be used.  No light would be just as good and not su bulky.</li>
    <li> Excellent product: solidly constructed, does what it promises, elegant. Large viewing area, easily adjusted tilt.  Changing bulbs is a snap.</li>
    <li> This mirror is not bright enough for me. It may be all right for some but I like more light.</li>
    <li> This is the second lighted mirror I&#x27;ve owned.  This one was twice the price of my first mirror and not nearly as nice.  The mirror is rather small in size and the light is not as bright as it should be. One needs to be in a very well lit room when using the light.  Recommend to others that are contemplating this purchase, look for a less expensive one!</li>
    <li> Just the right magnification!  Excellent quality item with just enough light to make magnified viewing great.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror except I agree with the other reviewers that it does not produce enough light.  Luckily I have a well lighted bathroom.  I hardly ever even turn on the light because first, it is dim and adds almost nothing and second, the switch to turn on the light is inconveniently located on the cord.  I think the switch should be on the unit itself so I don&#x27;t have to fumble around for the cord which is always intertwined with my blow dryer cord or whatever else is plugged into my electrical outlet.  I do like the quality of the mirror, the size and height of the unit, and it feels stable and well built.</li>
    <li> Perfect for putting on my makeup.  The 5x is just enough to put your eye makeup on easily.  Love this light.  This is my second one in twenty yrs.</li>
    <li> I needed a lighting mirror because of the way the sunlight is cast through the bathroom window, but the light on this mirror was ineffective. It wasn&#x27;t bright enough to light shaded areas of my face when I applied makeup.</li>
    <li> I was extremely satisfied when I received this mirror.  It is bigger than I expected and I love the 5X magnification.  I have been hunting for quite a while and most of the mirrors I have found were too high in the magnification.  I can tweeze my eyebrows without glasses....I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted and is exactly as described.  Great value!</li>
    <li> The quality of the mirror is good, however it would be more effective if the lighted circle around the mirror were brighter.  It needs to be used in a very well lit area to appreciate the magnification.  I have used the wall mounted version in several hotel bathrooms which were very well lit and I was quite impressed with the quality. This is what prompted me to purchase the mirror on the stand.  I would certainly recommend the product, just be sure you have adequate room lighting.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror every day to \\&quot;put on my face\\&quot;. I use the magnified side,(eyes aren&#x27;t what they used to be)! The light could be a little brighter.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror almost everyday. For anyone over 50 that has the bifocal thing going on you need one of these. I save a fortune now being able to do my own eyebrows instead of getting them waxed all the time. Great magnification. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the light could be a bit brighter. Fortunately I have good light in my bathroom so it doesn&#x27;t matter much to me, but it could be a problem if you have low light.</li>
    <li> When I was on vacation last year in Italy most of the hotel rooms had lighted make-up mirrors. I have been looking for one ever since.  This product is similar.  It is substantial and beautiful.  It casts a pleasing light and it makes putting on make-up easy and the results are flawless.  It&#x27;s a little disturbing at first to magnify a 50 year old face! Who knew a face could have so much character? The only reservation I have with this product is the light could be a little brighter.  All in all I really like the mirror.  I bought one for my sister and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> Lighting a bit low, but it has good magnification for my needs and is aesthetically pleasing!  I like the mirror.</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 of these. I got 1 for myself last year and another for my mother this year. Works great.</li>
    <li> Very great product and well worth the money. When you need the best,simply buy at amazon.com !!! Great product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> While vacationing, our resort room had a wonderful magnifying mirror. When we came home, we just had to get one. We found this one by Jerdon to be just what we wanted. The mirror looks great, nice enough to keep out on the vanity, we ordered the one that matches our bath fixtures. The magnification is just right and the light is very helpful. It&#x27;s a sturdy mirror-it won&#x27;t get knocked over easily. Very nice product. Happy with our purchase.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0000AFUTB Jerdon HL745NC 5X Magnification Two Sided Lighted Mirror]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can see to put my makeup on properly!</li>
    <li> on time and as described</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror.  I researched on Amazon before buying my magnifying mirror and it is everything i expected.  I have had it for over a year and it is still GREAT!</li>
    <li> The magnified mirror is great, can&#x27;t put on my makeup without it. Perfect height on my vanity.  Lighting is great.</li>
    <li> Was on vacation at a resort in Galveston, Tx. This mirror was in our room and I commented to my husband how much I liked the height of it and the light. So, being the wonderful, generous man he is, he looked at the product info, googled it, and ordered it. You can imagine my delight when it arrived. Love it, get one!</li>
    <li> I had used this exact mirror in a hotel in California.  I was very happy to find it available for purchase.  It came in ALMOST PERFECT condition.  I was a bit disappointed in that there were a few very small scratches on the base of the mirror.  I considered sending it back, but decided that I can &#x27;live&#x27; with the imperfections.  Too bad the company doesn&#x27;t have a bit better quality control.</li>
    <li> This Halo Lighted Vanity Mirror was just what my wife needed as she can not see very good without her glasses on and this was just what she needed to see better to put on her makeup. She is very happy with it .</li>
    <li> I stayed at a hotel that had these mirrors and loved it so much, that when I returned home I ordered one for myself.  However, there is a warning in the box that says not to leave where it is exposed to direct sunlight due to risk of fire.  Wish I had known this before ordering as I would not have ordered it as my bathroom has a large window.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! The mirror is well lighted. The magnification is just right. The lens grind has no visible aberrations.</li>
    <li> very nice.  daughter uses it everyday, and is very happy with it. I would recommend it. wonderful makeup mirror, and great for tweezing the eyebrows!</li>
    <li> This product was advertised perfectly.  I bought it as a gift and the recipient was VERY happy with product.  It came in new packaging and has a great magnification mirror on one side and wonderfully lit normal mirror on the other.</li>
    <li> I bought this model Jerdon mirror about 12 years ago and it is just now requiring a light bulb change!  It has been incredibly durable, is nice-looking on the vanity, and is so convenient for applying makeup and and doing other up-close \\&quot;tasks.\\&quot; I have found the amount of illumination to be more than adequate. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted-clear, 5X magnification, light helpful to see, fits in small space</li>
    <li> Used mirror in out of state hotel room and loved it! Ordered online and was exactly as expected!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror for makeup application</li>
    <li> After doing my research online and going to stores to look at some mirrors, I finally decided on this one.  I think this is a great mirror for the price, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it was cheaply made and looks really good. Also, I really like that it brings a replacement bulb. I would recommend this mirror to anyone looking for a good quality mirror for a decent price.</li>
    <li> The mirror does not magnify nearly enough - and the light is not very bright.</li>
    <li> It is bigger than what i was looking for, but now that i am using it daily i wouldnt want anything smaller. if i need to see up close i do have to use my lamp the lights are not as bright, but for makeup and things like that the light is fine</li>
    <li> This is what I needed!  I can see to put on make up without my glasses.  Putting in contacts is a breeze!</li>
    <li> I used this mirror in a hotel and I was able to see to put on makeup even with my contacts in.</li>
    <li> Well constructed.  Very functional and does a good job.  Looks good, too.  Two thumbs up on this product.  A winner.</li>
    <li> The lighting system on the mirror is not bright enough for optimal usage when applying makeup on normal room light</li>
    <li> The lights are not bright enough.  I had to put a bright lamp next to the light to turn on in order to see in the mirror.  I am very disappointed with the purchase due to the price of the item.  I expected more.</li>
    <li> Sits perfectly in our bathroom.  The light really helps illuminate your face for applying make-up, removing unwanted hairs, etc.</li>
    <li> The light is not bright enough!! After checking everywhere, purchasing this one and returning it - I finally opted to use a non-lit mirror with a light behind it ...works great.</li>
    <li> I Love this makeup mirror! It is the perfect size for me and it has great magnification. I haven&#x27;t even plugged it in, didn&#x27;t need the light.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this mirror,it is a good product and make a good addition to our Master Bathroom.</li>
    <li> I really wish the light was brighter but I love the mirror...At least they send you a second bulb, though I&#x27;ve heard the original one should last a really long time...</li>
    <li> Excellent product; came quickly; packaged very well, and price was very good.</li>
    <li> Product does not work well.  We switch on the light and it last less then 10 minutes the light bulb blow. This include the spare bulb and now we left the mirror standing on the table and try to figure what to do with a defective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the problem from buying from Amazon - No Warranty Services!</li>
    <li> It sure is pretty, setting on my dressing table..but my finished make-up looks quite different when I see myself in a mirror somewhere else throughout the day.  The lighting is a bit off in my opinion. It appears to have a golden/yellow cast which throws off colors. I do love the 5X side, very helpful.  I will use it, but only with the light turned off. I just can&#x27;t get past the strange color of light!!</li>
    <li> Nice mirror but needs to be brighter.  A variable lighting function would be helpful. Quality construction and materials are used.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews but thought that it would work just fine&lt;br /&gt;The light is extremely dim&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like how short the pedestal stand is either</li>
    <li> The light is way too dim to be useful.  I bought this as a gift for my wife and she never uses it.</li>
    <li> The switch to turn it on and off is on the cord.  It should be on the base of the lamp - otherwise the light and magnification is good.</li>
    <li> Real nice mirror but...  unfortunately the on/off switch is cheap and on the cord.&lt;br /&gt;I had to return because it couldn&#x27;t be used on Wife&#x27;s vanity without leaving cord out&lt;br /&gt;on top of vanity.  Needed one with turn on/off switch on mount.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and perfect magnification for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s big, heavy and cumbersome. The light is not very bright. Way to expensive for not much!</li>
    <li> Nice heavy mirror with good magnification.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife a year ago as a gift. She&#x27;s able to sit and apply make-up.  From what she says it&#x27;s great for eyeliner, exfoliating, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit to using it a few times for ingrown facial hairs.  I do recall turning the room lights out and turning the mirror lights on for a spotlight view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the bulb has hung in there over the last year and replacing isn&#x27;t a handful.</li>
    <li> I could not do without this!  It is not always a pretty picture, but it does always tell the truth ;-)  Very nice mirror!</li>
    <li> love the mirror and great help with putting makeup on... with the light it makes it able to see everything</li>
    <li> This is the best thing since sliced bread!</li>
    <li> As I age my eyes really appreciate the 5X magnification in this mirror!  It really is wonderful to see all the details of my eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Product delivered as described. Wife likes it</li>
    <li> I love my new mirror.  I previously had the same mirror for years until I cracked the glass.  This new one the base is much lighter. The other mirror was heavier, but it really does not matter.  I like the switch being on the bottom of the mirror and not on the cord as my old one was.  Its perfect for putting on makeup.  The magnifying side is great for close ups.  Its 5x magnification and good enough.  Too much magnification makes it hard to see your face for putting on make up.  Makes me dizzy. The Halo light is nice and soft and bright enough.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
