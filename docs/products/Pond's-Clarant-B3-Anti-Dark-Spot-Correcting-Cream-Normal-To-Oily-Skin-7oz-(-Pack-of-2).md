      <li>Of all the Ponds creams, this is one of the better ones.</li>

      <li>skin tone has become more even.  </li>
      <li>In 4 weeks cleared even more as advertised.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There is a fragrance, but nothing overwhelming or unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just be sure to apply it multiple times a day and stay out of the sun for the best results.  </li>
      <li>The Mexican-based companies are very experienced with their lightening creams to meet the demands of their customers, and I would trust their expertise over American lightening creams any day.  </li>
      <li>Pond&#x27;s Clarant B3 formula is not too oily or drying, and I love how it smells.</li>
      <li>It has a luxurious silky fee to it along with a lovely, but not overpowering, fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products, even those including hydroquinone, but none seemed to work as well as this one.</li>
      <li>COming the healing marks problem, i didnt observed a very significant effect.</li>

      <li>I am so excited that something is working to lighten these spots!</li>
      <li>It easy to apply and gets absorbed real quick!</li>
      <li>What I love about is that it does go on light and it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling afterwards.</li>
      <li>Easy application.  </li>
      <li>Overall the product is amazing for oily skin types, and seems to be a good lightening cream without hydroquinone.</li>
      <li>It nourishes and absorbs very quickly into the skin, doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily and does not block pores.  </li>
      <li>It absorves easily to the skin and does not feel greasy.</li>
      <li>The smell is so strong it made my eyes and skin burn.</li>
      <li>Strong scent when opening the jar.  </li>
      <li>My skin had a more even tint and was brighter, clearer and yes more white and fair looking.  </li>
      <li>This is a perfect product to tone your skin and remove dark marks.</li>
      <li>after suffering from breakouts, i realized that my pores clogs very easily and that i would need to use a toner with this cream.(the reason that i did not use toner with clarant b3 before was that the cream sits on top of the toner and takes about a minute to really absorb in to the skin if applied after toner.)    </li>
      <li>If you have no problem with those bath&amp;body works perfumery lotions, you should be fine with this cream.</li>
      <li>i have been using the clarant b3 normal to oily skin for three weeks now and so far i have been impressed with the results.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews on amazon received my HUGE jar of ponds</li>
      <li>This cream goes on smooth and light and not at all greasy.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews before and thought maybe I can try since it is so cheap.</li>
      <li>I put it on like 3-4 times a day since its that light on the face.</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy this product because it&#x27;s cheap</li>
      <li>It goes on light and your skin absorbs it almost immediately.</li>
      <li>I was prescribed Benzaclin which was great and worked to help bring the acne under control and not spread any further.  </li>
      <li>Fast shippment,good looking package!!!</li>
      <li>I am pretty sure it had nothing to do with it.</li>
      <li>Within 10 weeks, my face has significantly improved.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s working great for that and even better then my old foot cream.</li>
      <li>The clarant B3 that I had originally bought in Mexico before it was approved in the US stated on the package that the product also contained UV filters.  </li>
      <li>the cream is light and absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it, and very cost effective.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a matte clean finish.  </li>
      <li>but I am already more than satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve had so far.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup and never did because of oily skin, but also I just don&#x27;t wear makeup except for special occasions.</li>
      <li>Even after stopping use while struggling with acne, the improvement in pigmentation in these marks has stayed for a full month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>(The scent also disappears fairly quickly after application.)</li>
      <li>I buy the Walgreens store brand mild soap or use dove.  </li>
      <li>I like the texture of the cream, it does absorb quickly</li>
      <li>Dries quickly</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product ever since I started using it I notice my skin started looking better.. I have acne prone skin and I find this cream helps me a lot... Not only it gets rid of dark spots (Mind you not at a speedy rate &amp; not in a radical way) but helps somewhat. I&#x27;d recomend it for people with very oily skin who have acne prone skin like me.</li>
    <li> Amazon rocks!  I have purchased millions of items on Amazon and have never left a review until now.  I LOVE this Pond&#x27;s product and I received it only yesterday!      It has a luxurious silky fee to it along with a lovely, but not overpowering, fragrance.  It immediately absorbs into the skin without leaving a sticky or greasy film.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it so I rubbed a dab of it on a small spot on the back of my hand and I swear, I saw an immediate improvement in the size and color of the dark spot!  It might be all in my head, but after applying to my face and neck before going to bed last night, this morning the dark spots seemed lighter.  I&#x27;ve tried two products before this Pond&#x27;s product and didn&#x27;t see any real improvement after months of usage.  Nuetrogena corrector did nothing after using 4-5 tubes and Roc seemed to make the spots darker for some reason.  Another added bonus of this product is that it makes a great base for your makeup.    Try this if you are looking for something for your dark spots and/or uneven skin tone!  You&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised just like I am.  Did I say I just love it?</li>
    <li> I like the  product it works and I found what I was looking for!!! finale !!! it will be a good product to use, I do not have to think of some other product that works as this Pond&#x27;s Clarant B3.</li>
    <li> I was using Complex 15. That worked really well, but I think the dry winter spell made it unsuitable. Switched to Pond&#x27;s a week ago. And it&#x27;s amazing! my skin is looking better (less &#x27;scaly&#x27;), though I can&#x27;t say the same for my dark spots...then again, it&#x27;s only been a week.&lt;br /&gt;It is a cream, which did make me worry about my face looking oily later in the day, but that did not happen. It easy to apply and gets absorbed real quick! Great under makeup too.&lt;br /&gt;There is a fragrance, but nothing overwhelming or unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------UPDATE---------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries out my skin. Especially when I use it overnight. Now I&#x27;ve combined it with another moisturizer. Use that as a base then Pond&#x27;s to see if I can get both a moisturizing effect plus skin toning.</li>
    <li> My face is generally very oily, and due to my acne medications, and i have really dry spots too, making finding a moisturizer really difficult, especially one with UV filters, as these tend to be really thick and greasy even if they are not oil-based or claim to be \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot;, which i never find to be the case.  The Clarant B3 formula for normal to oily skin is really good for evening everything out, as far as the oiliness is concerned.  The feeling is also really fresh.  It indeed gives a matte appearance, although after a few hours, I still see some oil, as should be expected.  As far as removing dark spots, the moisturizer does a good job of making the skin tone look very even when it is applied.  I would not be the best person to ask if the results are permanent, because I still have acne so I get new dark spots all the time and can&#x27;t really keep track of the old ones.  I, however, can say that my forehead has been acne free for awhile, and the skin looks very even.  I&#x27;ve even starting to use it on my back for my acne scars there to see if it works, and it looks to be improving.  It is hard to say if this is a natural healing process or the clarant B3 at work.  The product will probably work better for spots due to sun exposure (as it was designed) as opposed to acne.  While I have never tried a lightening cream with hydroquinone, this product has worked for me as a natural looking lightening cream.  Just be sure to apply it multiple times a day and stay out of the sun for the best results.  The Mexican-based companies are very experienced with their lightening creams to meet the demands of their customers, and I would trust their expertise over American lightening creams any day.  (I would trust Americans from bronzing creams).  The clarant B3 that I had originally bought in Mexico before it was approved in the US stated on the package that the product also contained UV filters.  While the package does not explicitly state this, the ingredients contain ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (a UV reflecting agent), and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (a UV absorbing agent).  I do not have the other package to compare the ingredients to, but for me it is a good sign that the moisturizer has these UV filters.  I should mention that I think the product is really only suited for incidental sun exposure.  I did experience a little bit of irritation and reddening at first.  This may be due to sensitivity caused by my acne medication.  I found that by instead of applying the moisturizer with a brushing motion, but rather a patting motion, I was able to avoid redness and irritation.  Overall the product is amazing for oily skin types, and seems to be a good lightening cream without hydroquinone. It provides everything I need and want in a moisturizer.  I will not put any other moisturizer on my face, because they just don&#x27;t compare.  To show you how much I liked it, before this became available in the US, I even ordered the product off of Latino product sites at some pretty outrageous prices compared to the ones offered now.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful.  It nourishes and absorbs very quickly into the skin, doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily and does not block pores.  It isn&#x27;t greasy feeling at all; in fact, it has a very light feel and a nice, subtle fragrance. While not yet a senior citizen, I&#x27;m getting there and this moisturizing cream truly has evened out, brightened, and softened the skin on my hands and face.  Very highly recommended.  Pond&#x27;s products have been around forever and there is a reason....they just work.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple expensive creams trying to rid my face of the horrible large dark spots.  For years nothing has worked, very frustrating, time consuming and expensive.  I decided to give this cream a try and purchased it from my local Wal-mart.  I am only on my second week and I definitely notice a difference.  Even my husband has noticed.  After 2 weeks these dark brown spots are now light brown.  I am crossing my fingers that this will continue to improve my skin.  I have not had any problems with break outs as described by others.  This cream goes on smooth and light and not at all greasy.  I still continue my other skin regime that I have used for almost a year that includes retin A 3 times a week and an ultrasonic cleaning brush used daily.  I think the combo of these items works great for my skin.  I am so excited that something is working to lighten these spots!</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that could help even out the dark spots all over my body and brighten the complexion on my face while nourishing my skin, and I think I found it! Pond&#x27;s Clarant B3 formula is not too oily or drying, and I love how it smells. I try to use this once everyday after I shower and after just a week, I noticed some discolorations on my body due to bug bite scarring begin to fade! I&#x27;ve tried many products, even those including hydroquinone, but none seemed to work as well as this one. After a few days, I started applying this to my face as well, and I think it&#x27;s really brightening up my complexion! All in all, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the travel size at Target. It did not work for me, and made me break out!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I first found it in Peru, of coarse the packaging was all in Spanish.  Regardless managed to find it here and it leaves the same great feeling and refreshing results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I&#x27;m not sensitive to perfumes or scented creams, so while this product is indeed heavily scented, the scent becomes less apparent as you continue to use the cream. (The scent also disappears fairly quickly after application.) The cream is also heavy, which I personally like. I feel pretty insecure around thin creams-- I&#x27;ve never had a successful experience with one.  Anyway, I decided to go through an entire jar before making a review. I made my purchase back in October/November, and I&#x27;m actually still not quite finished with it. I use it once every morning (just before putting on makeup) and at night, since any more applications tend to overly dry the skin. My skin is oily-prone, so this cream not only helped my makeup last longer, it also balanced my overall complexion. Granted, there was an initial (note: minor) breakout on my first week, but I&#x27;ve had clear skin since. Ironically, I now find the first signs of a breakout when I neglect to use the cream for a day.  I&#x27;ll also mention that I initially bought this cream for skin lightening. I&#x27;ve been watching my face like a hawk every morning-- the change is gradual, but I have seen a difference. My face is finally lighter than my neck (a problem I&#x27;ve always had), and my close friends noticed the change as well.  Needless to say, this is a staple to my face routine. It&#x27;s pretty awesome.  PRO&#x27;s:  Balances/evens skin.  Helps makeup last longer.  Lightens skin tone (gradually).  Easy application.  CON&#x27;S:  Dries quickly (this could be a pro, be hey).  Strong scent when opening the jar.  Hope this helps someone!</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewer said, the cream has this bad perfume smell. it&#x27;s wayyy too strong for a facial cream and very strong as a body cream. I don&#x27;t use this on my face, but use it on arms and legs. With just that... it manage to get me sneeze almost every time I use it.     The cream itself is okay, helps even out dark spots. They just need to cut out on this bad perfume smell. If you have no problem with those bath&amp;body works perfumery lotions, you should be fine with this cream. I will switch back to Ambi.</li>
    <li> not worth trying to endure the smell</li>
    <li> I never right reviews but have been wanting to right a review for this product since I bought it back in January this year.  I have had acne all my life.  As I got older the acne got a little better and I would suffer the occasional breakout every few days, but always have had breakouts.  Then last year something went out of wack and I developed full blown acne vulgaris all over my face, forehead, eyebrows, ears, you name it.  I am 42 years old!  I was prescribed Benzaclin which was great and worked to help bring the acne under control and not spread any further.  However it dried out my skin terribly and left a blanket of blackheads that were difficult to get rid of without doing the worse thing, which is popping them.  So in addition to the blackheads, I had hyperpigmentation all over my face from popping the pimples.  My face was covered in acne dark spots.  Every moisturizer I&#x27;ve used in the past did nothing for my face.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup and never did because of oily skin, but also I just don&#x27;t wear makeup except for special occasions. I have extremely oily skin, all the products that claimed to not clog pores over the years did not work, (with the exception of Aveeno daily even tone moisturizer), however that didn&#x27;t alleviate the mild breakouts.  But it was non irritating and it was the best I could do at the time.  I stumbled across the Pond&#x27;s Clarant B3 for Normal to Oily skin back in January of this year.  Literally stumbled on it by accident while at the drug store.  Within the first night of use, immediately I could tell the difference in the texture of my skin.  It was smooth and soft and moisturized without being greasy.  It leaves a matte clean finish.  It is a water based formula that is creamy like whipped cream and you don&#x27;t need much.  Within two weeks the dark spots started to get lighter and the less noticeable spots began to disappear.  In 4 weeks cleared even more as advertised.  Since my spotting was severe, it took more than 4 weeks to clear my skin.  Within 10 weeks, my face has significantly improved. As long as this product is on the market, I will continue to use it.  Not only does it not clog my pores, my skin has never looked and felt better.  I have mild dark spots around the jawline that continue to lighten daily because again, my dark spots were severe.  Within 10 weeks my dark spots are minimal and my pores completely acne free.  I have begun to use it on my shoulders and upper arms where my skin can be blotchy and acne prone.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has oily skin and acne prone.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, however it is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I can wash my face with any soap now.  I buy the Walgreens store brand mild soap or use dove.  But nothing expensive.  I like to keep it simple.  I then wash and moisurize with the Ponds Clarant B3 morning and night.  I actually look forward to washing my face and smoothing it on every day!  Give it a try.  It&#x27;s worth it, and very cost effective.  My first jar lasted 2 months.  Good luck to you if you try it, and remember be patient!  You can expect in 4 weeks to see spots lighten, but a little longer to disappear.  It will be worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described. Thanks a million.</li>
    <li> love it as part of my morning and nightly routine  1. wash face with clean and clear bleakhead scrub  ---------love it because i battle blackheads and acne in one step  2. apply neutrogena oil-free acne stress control toner   --------minimizes my large pores and medicated to fight acne  3. apply ponds clarant b3 for normal to oily skin  --------fades my acne scars and brighten my complection    i love clarant b3 for normal to oily skin because i have combonation skin and my face does not really like mineral oil which is an ingrediant in clarant b3 for normal to dry skin. the first week that i tried this product, i did it without step 2. after suffering from breakouts, i realized that my pores clogs very easily and that i would need to use a toner with this cream.(the reason that i did not use toner with clarant b3 before was that the cream sits on top of the toner and takes about a minute to really absorb in to the skin if applied after toner.)    bottom line, i would recommend it to anyone who wants to fade dark spots and acne scars, FADE being the key word because it probably wont eliminate acne scars and darkspots that are more than a couple shades darker than your skin tone.    GREAT AS PART OF A ROUTINE!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Hand&#x27;s down, this is my favorite moisturizer. I&#x27;ve had moderate to severe acne since my teens with really oily skin. I was using Proactiv for years until it stopped working for me and I started to break out again. From what I&#x27;ve noticed, while it does not completely get rid of the shine on my face, it does reduce it significantly (T-zone still has a lot of work). As for scarring, any new scars that I have are now noticeably reduced, but I can&#x27;t say the same for older scars, hence why I only gave this produce a 4/5. Not that it hasn&#x27;t done anything for old discoloration, it&#x27;s just that it will take a lot longer so that&#x27;s something to keep in mind. I will continue to buy this product because it&#x27;s cheap and it does work.</li>
    <li> All the marks in my face that caused due to pimples have gone, it also improved my complexion. I have used the other versions of this like &amp;#34;Ponds white beauty&amp;#34;. Same formula in different packages, love them all.</li>
    <li> This product has a very strong scent and it dried out my face.  Don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again or recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. My age spots are lighter, my skin is more bright. I use it for 2 weeks only. I hope I will get rid of my sun spots. Wonderful product. I love the smell and the cream like whipped cream.</li>
    <li> NOT good for Combination  Skin &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I 100% recommend this product to anyone. It goes on light and your skin absorbs it almost immediately. You can already feel the difference instantly once it&#x27;s on your skin. What I love about is that it does go on light and it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling afterwards. It hasn&#x27;t made me breakout or leave that reddish hue on my skin. I noticed that it has cleared up my skin and I don&#x27;t mean in a blemish kinda way but the color itself has turned lighter. I noticed that when I was putting on my foundation. I suppose that&#x27;s because it reduces dark patches on your skin. I love it. I regret not finding this sooner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still dark.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is still slightly uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as a moisturizer, it&#x27;s not bad. It doesn&#x27;t heavily moisturize your face, but its a nice light little thing. I put it on like 3-4 times a day since its that light on the face. The smell is very pleasant but the way its packaged is kind of unhygienic if your hands are dirty and you&#x27;re always sticking your hands in the jar. ):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad though. Plus, I didn&#x27;t really expect something so cheap to actually lighten my skin a lot. So, eh. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer - plus it&#x27;s cheap and comes in a pack of 2. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream, it smells nice and does seem to be lightening the dark areas that I use it on.</li>
    <li> Despues de leer varias revisiones decidi provar esta crema.  Solo la use durante una semana y eso basto para producirme puntos negros sobre mi nariz y parte de las mejillas. Por mi experiencia, no recomiendo esta crema a personas con piel propensa al acne o sensible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After many reviews I tried this cream, and let me tell you that this cream is the worse cream I have tried, it produces to me break out (blackheads)all over my nose and cheeks in just one week.</li>
    <li> It is good as a moisturizing cream if you have oily face because it is non greasy.  I have ben using it for around 2 months already and even though my face overall looks lighter, i have notice no change on my dark spots at all.  I will probably use it until is over and try another dark spot corrector.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading the rave reviews. I have gone through many products for hyper pigmentation with no success. The most disappointing was clinique&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product religiously and had absolutely NO results. It didn&#x27;t even work to help overall tone, moisturizer, let alone fade spots.  The product also has a heavy fragrance that I endured over the months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, although it&#x27;s inexpensive, it can be money saved...absolutely not worth trying :(</li>
    <li> As I stated in an earlier POND&#x27;S review, I love their products....been using them for years, as have other friends and family.</li>
    <li> One thing I would say is that it made my skin smooth and soft. I don&#x27;t remember what else it did, I forgot. It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
    <li> At first, I bought a little version of this creame from target. Then, I found out that it was pretty decent of a cream. Then I tried to buy a bigger one, which I could not find anywhere in target. So, I ordered it from amazon. It works pretty well. Not that miraculous but doesnot damage my skin either which other creams definitely do. It gives a matte feel to my oily skin and I don&#x27;t use any other products above it. It feels good. You should definitely try.</li>
    <li> Love it . . Especial para pieles grasa</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this item.  Seemed to have no affect and did not even hydrate well enough.  I would look for some else and not purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Works and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> this is one of the rarest creams that feels non-greasy and dry. Gives a fair coating on your skin. smells nice. COming the healing marks problem, i didnt observed a very significant effect. But its a nice moisturizer with good smell and quality.</li>
    <li> i previously read that  item will cause more breakouts but i still took a chance. guess what it caused more breakouts, nearly immediately upon use.</li>
    <li> Fast shippment,good looking package!!! A pack of two creams as the same as described the AD,used twice times the product,the skin absorbed well,i&#x27;ll keep using it till the acnes are gon away,in a word i&#x27;d like to recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> i have been using the clarant b3 normal to oily skin for three weeks now and so far i have been impressed with the results.  however there are a few drawbacks with this product.    Pros:  the cream is light and absorbs quickly into the skin.  my lighter discolorations have become much lighter.  skin tone has become more even.  the cost is much less per ounce than olay regenerist serum.  it held back my normal oily sheen through my makeup for 4 hours.  works on other dark pigmented areas besides your face.      Cons:  the scent reminds me of a lighter version of some bad 70&#x27;s perfume.  it takes some time to get used to.  you have to use it consistently twice a day or it doesn&#x27;t work as well or not at all.  i broke out in small pimples the first 2 weeks i used it until my skin got used to it.  the darker discolorations on my face are not getting lighter.  i&#x27;m assuming it will take some time for those.    UPDATE:    i have been using this cream for over 2 months.  it has not worked as well on my darker discolorations.  in fact, the color has not changed much at all.  i would recommend this for skin discolorations that are 1 to 2 shades darker than your actual skin tone.  anything 3 shades or darker will probably not work as well.      i will update my review as time goes on to see if time does make a difference with the darker discolorations.</li>
    <li> This cream surprised me! I read the reviews before and thought maybe I can try since it is so cheap. and I do not regret this time! The cream looks thick, but as soon as I applied it to my face, I can feel the water and moisturizing effect. It has a matte finish, and my face doesn&#x27;t get shiny so soon. Most importantly, I&#x27;m not breaking out! Also, it does have a pleasant smell. The 2 jars I bought will last for a while. I would definitely recommend it to those who have combination~oily skin and tend to break out.</li>
    <li> I have heard a lot about this product how it even out the skin and I looked every where for it and did not find it.  Thank you Amazon, you guys have everything that I cannot find in the stores.  I really like this cream I love the way it smells....this is the first Pond&#x27;s cream I use and I am very happy. Follow the instructions and then use it less after the first couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> First of all, if you are sensitive to perfumes, you need to run away from this product as far as you can.  There is no reason why there should be that much perfume in a facial moisturizer.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it caused the breakouts I received when first using it.  Second, I have combination skin and this cream has managed to dry out my whole face.  I only gave it two stars for the matte finish it creates instead of an oily one like most moisturizers.  I tried the normal to dry skin, but that was just too oily.</li>
    <li> I had to wash it off immediately.  The smell is so strong it made my eyes and skin burn. Thank goodness I only bought a trial size at Target. Sorry Ponds.  My Mother used ponds when I was growing up. If it had a nice light rose scent or was unscented it would be wonderful.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really moisturize skin. It works for dark spots but after using it for a while it stops working.</li>
    <li> I have tried salicylic acid and retinol, and all these would work on most hyperpigmentation to some extent (and often completely peel off recent acne marks), but not my most stubborn. Hydroquinone scared me :(.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a persistent patch of hyperpigmentation. It needs constant use of some lightening ingredient. It is not melasma, but an area I traumatized with peeling it off when it got damaged. This cream had really really reduced it in two weeks, more than any other cream I have used. I am confident it would have disappeared for the first time with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, this cream neither worsened or bettered my non-hormonal acne. I am pretty sure it had nothing to do with it. It did lighten up months-long slow healing acne marks (dark and red) very very well in two weeks. Even after stopping use while struggling with acne, the improvement in pigmentation in these marks has stayed for a full month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the derm put me on epiduo for my non-hormonal acne and told me to use a good moisturizer. My zinc oxide based sunscreen is on the drying side, so I am restarting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while the cream may help you with mild acne issues (especially those willing to wait out the ocassional small 2-3 pimples) if you have severe and lots of acne you may need another treatment in conjunction.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream to me as a good hydroquinone free option for evening my skin tone. After using some prescription products and still feeling uncomfortable leaving the house without foundation because of dark patches on my cheeks and around my mouth, I was more than a little skeptical. To my surprise, however, I started seeing more even skin after two weeks. Acne marks that I had for years almost vanished, and the hormone related skin darkening on my cheeks and around my mouth lightened significantly. I just started leaving the house makeup-free and couldn&#x27;t be more confident in my skin. I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> As with any sort of skincare product that is meant to be for the masses, it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I have oily/dry (I suppose you could call it combination) skin, and I&#x27;m 19, so I do have a little bit of acne. While I was using this product, it worked very well for making the acne scars that I have become a lot lighter, as well as improving my overall skin tone. But because my face needs a lot of moisture, this product completely dried out my face, but it did make my face look more matte. Overall, it was excellent at getting rid of dark spots and acne scars, but because of the way my skin is, it dried my face out very quickly. If you have very oily skin that is not combined with dry skin, I would recommend this, but other than that, use caution.</li>
    <li> Overall, I do like service provided. The price is reasonable and I got my jars on time. I put this cream on my face for like 2 days without any problems. I like the texture, it&#x27;s very light and it is like whipped cream. After 2 days using this cream, my face becomes very itchy and turns red. I got scared so I stopped using this product. I think my skin is allergic to certain ingredients in this cream. It is hypoallergenic though.</li>
    <li> My face is very oily and it worked well to keep it under control however I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I cant say i&#x27;ve seen any dramatic difference at all; however, it does help to control the oil so I will continue to use it and hope that it does fade my dark spots over more time.</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and frangrant. It absorves easily to the skin and does not feel greasy. I can&#x27;t tell the difference of my my dark spots. It may take a little more time.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I had a bad sun burn and the dark spots that were left from it would not fade.  I used just one jar, by the time the jar was empty I saw a visible difference.  My skin had a more even tint and was brighter, clearer and yes more white and fair looking.  I also love Bio-hydrant, which gives lot of moisture to mature skin.</li>
    <li> When I bought this face cream, I was already using another face cream and the jar was nearly empty.  I have not used it long but I&#x27;m certain I will like using it and probably reorder when its done.</li>
    <li> I would give this a 5 out of 5 except for the scent. I actually think it smells nice but I have allergies so it bothers me a little. Instead of using it on my hands and face I&#x27;m using it on my dry, cracked heals. So far it&#x27;s working great for that and even better then my old foot cream.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, but did not work on dark spots.  I did read the other reviews and most were favorable, but&lt;br /&gt;my experience was not good.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that I will use on my face. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin greasy or dry. It also cleared up my dark spots pretty quickly. As long as ponds keeps making this product I will be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ my cream smells great and so far it is working.Thank you I&#x27;m very happy with my order. And i received it very fast.</li>
    <li> This product reminded me of my childhood when mother used to use it on my face.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my face for exactly one month and have noticed that an age/sun spot (about the size of a dime) has gotten about 40% lighter. Overall my skin feels softer.  I am going to continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and freckles and of course in the summer freckles get darker so I wanted something to lighten them up a bit and man has this done the trick! Of course I still have freckles but they blend in so much better since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I got this as a tester for like a buck, and have been using it regularly (for about three weeks) without really thinking about it. The other day I noticed that my acne scars actually looked like they were fading significantly and it wasn&#x27;t until then that I even realized that this was a fading moisturizer! I have used everything under the sun in an attempt to fade the hyperpigmentation left from my near constant breakouts (Ambi, Clinique, NuDerm, etc.) at much higher prices and none of them made a noticable difference, and contain hydroquinine! It seems to be working for me, and I will continue to use it. Also, it seems to be a really good facial moisturizer as well; abosrbs fast and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or cause excess oil.</li>
    <li> I have ALWAYs bought moisturizer from the make up counter - Clinique, philosophy, MAC.... Etc. all costing $35+. I read the reviews on amazon received my HUGE jar of ponds and I love it!  It is thick, but not greasy, smells good, and it seems to be improving my unevenness. It has only been 2 weeks but it is totally worth ordering.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! I have been using this for over 2 months. It has almost faded my all my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;This is a gentle product and does keep my skin moist. PONDS does it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while and honestly I have not been noticing any good or bad effects in my skin at all. The only good thing I like about this cream is my skin gets very dry after shower and it moisture s my face enough to protect from dryness and does not make it oily at all!</li>
    <li> Ingredients not effective.</li>
    <li> My mother and my grandmother love it, they say that PONDS is a great brand and that works really well, my Grandmother has been using this brand more than 20 years, and she said that the ones made in USA are the best.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product.!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Feels great on my face.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect product to tone your skin and remove dark marks. It works wonders on dark spots. Can be a bit greasy at times. The product arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> I am 52 and have dark spots on my face from a combination of sun damage and scars from ongoing skin irritations (that I have been dealing with for years).  I also have (had!) noticeably darker skin on both sides of my neck from sun damage, my neck has looked 2-toned for years (the center was much lighter due to my chin shadowing it, I guess).  Literally after 1 DAY of using Clarant B3 AntiDark cream, the sides of my neck were lighter.  I have been using it twice a day for about 10 days now and my neck is pretty much the same tone everywhere, as if that damage never happened!!  My spots/scars are also much less noticeable but not gone completely, which is certainly good enough for me.  I will keep using it to hopefully continue the lightening of the scars but I am already more than satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve had so far.  I like the texture of the cream, it does absorb quickly and I have no issue at all with the smell - not strong or offensive at all, in my opinion.  I did experience some pimply looking bumps around my chin the 1st few days but as long as I don&#x27;t overdo it (meaning using it more than twice a day, which I did try...) the bumps stay away.  I am very happy to have found this product.</li>
    <li> Of all the Ponds creams, this is one of the better ones. This, Ponds Caring Classic Extra and Ponds Dry skin cream is what I recommend. Yet, I have not tried them all...</li>
    <li> This product works great! It takes a week or more to start noticing results but if you give it time and drink lots of water you will see your complexion improve as well as the dark spots fading. Love it!</li>
