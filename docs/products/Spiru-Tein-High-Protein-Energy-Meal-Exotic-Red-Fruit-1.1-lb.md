      <li>Awesome product...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad my niece discovered it!!!!</li>
      <li>The variety is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>Wonderful taste and mixes well in my shaker.</li>
      <li>Great tasting shake!</li>
      <li>I use this as a diet aid, and it is great!</li>
      <li>This is the best alterenative for replacing dairy!</li>
      <li>This is delicious when you mix this with strawberries!</li>
      <li>I mix it with coconut water or Bia5 fruit juice -very good.</li>
      <li>and it greatly improves.</li>
      <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I think it tastes great in water, but for those who prefer a creamier consistency, I can see why mixing in milk as suggested would be appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is great for athletes to replace lost nutrients while training.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great, my wife and I have been using Spiru-tein as a vegan protein supplement for over a year now.</li>
      <li>It tastes great, is good for you and can be added to shakes, oatmeal, and cereal.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s another one that tastes really good (Cookies &amp; Cream) that I stopped using because it has wheat in it.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t taste as good as this one, but I like to give my tummy some variety.</li>
      <li>It was delicious and came right away.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>you feel better about 20 minutes after drinking it!</li>
      <li>We really like it and this flavor is the best!</li>
      <li>The exotic red fruit protein mix taste very good and great to mix with sweet fruits.</li>
      <li>I love the flavors, and it soothes the hunger.</li>
      <li>Love this brand, but I don&#x27;t like this flavor.</li>
      <li>Simply love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I used it every morning and re-ordered more.  </li>
      <li>Good nutrition is far superior to any energy drink.</li>
      <li>I love smoothies and can not have dairy.</li>
      <li>I cant stand that stuff but put in the freezer its much better and weakens the sugar a bit.</li>
      <li>I like the ingredients in this one; most of them are really healthy.</li>
      <li>It has lots of exotic fruits that I&#x27;ve read about as being Super Foods but can&#x27;t buy here.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure if anyone does that they will lose weight quickly.</li>
      <li>After drinking a glass of this I am satisfied, energized, &amp; calm.</li>
      <li>but if you have tendency towards any kind of UTIs be very wary.&lt;br</li>
      <li>make it 2 scoops at a time in my Blender Bottle for 28 grams of protein, and I mix it in water, and very rarely in rice or coconut milk to save calories.</li>
      <li>The Exotic Red Fruit is probably one of my most favorite Spirutein flavors.</li>
      <li>I will say the flavors are good they&#x27;re red fruit and the blueberry cream</li>
      <li>It has an ok taste and when you add fruit it can be very tasteful.</li>
      <li>this tastes nice after blending with some protein and vital nutrients</li>
      <li>Taste much better with light milk or soft smoothie flavored drinks.</li>
      <li>I have been on a high protein/lower carb diet for awhile now and found that it works best for me, but I&#x27;ve also discovered that I am sensitive to animal products such as whey and meat, so my search for a protein shake has been pretty varied.</li>
      <li>make breakfast smoothies with almond milk, frozen fruit, and various additives of my own, like MSM crystals, inositol, silica drops, hemp hearts, diatomaceous earth, Garden of Life probiotics, etc., and I&#x27;m set for the morning.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant berry-ish flavor, and goes down</li>
      <li>Our teenage son has commented how good he feels after a long run and how he is sure it&#x27;s because of the Spirutien.</li>
      <li>It was shipped very fast with no issues.</li>
      <li>and I always gladly come back to it.</li>
      <li>Already re-ordering before I finish the first container.</li>
      <li>The taste is like raspberry, and though I&#x27;m not a big raspberry fan, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I realize after searching on the Internet the other day that this is what has been causing my problems that I am having now so if you have any kind of kidney pain are susceptible to bladder infections I would recommend you don&#x27;t use this</li>
      <li>our taste very well</li>
      <li>Makes the morning smoothie much tastier.</li>
      <li>I add frozen blueberries or mixed berries, a spoon full of Fage yogurt and a dash of flaxseeds for a zestier taste and added fiber.</li>
      <li>High protein gets the day started well and cuts any carb cravings.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product, &amp; all it&#x27;s flavors.</li>
      <li>Be extremely careful if you have any kind of kidney problems using this product I have spent the last five days with a bladder and a kidney</li>
      <li>This is my least favorite flavor I love almost all the others this one just taste too much like fake sugar</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried the Vanilla, Pina Colada, Tangerine, Banana, and Blue Berry so far.</li>
      <li>At first taste I was not excited.</li>

<li> I visited my local healthfood store and picked up a myriad of protein shake single serving packets</li>
<li> The hard chunks are actually fruit skins, which I prefer soft over crunchy -so</li>
<li> The only thing I do differently than the package states is I add an extra 3 oz of soy milk to mix with it because it can be a bit thick.</li>
<li> a lot of hours..very hard, physical work.</li>
<li> only complaint is there always seems to be a bit of the powder that sticks at the bottom of my bottle and refuses to be integrated with the water and the rest of my shake.</li>
<li> With a bit less almond milk or liquid of your choise it gets the consistency of a frozen yougurt.</li>
<li> a little ice, juice, and some berries or even just water</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a negligable amount (maybe 1/4 - 1/2 tsp), but it still doesn&#x27;t mix quite as well as some of the whey proteins I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
<li> I never got tired of it.  </li>
<li> I can never get bored.</li>
<li> This did not give me any energy at all  and for the price I was extremely disappointed.</li>

    <li> Awesome product...you feel better about 20 minutes after drinking it! Im a massage therapist &amp; work a lot of hours..very hard, physical work. Good nutrition is far superior to any energy drink. After drinking a glass of this I am satisfied, energized, &amp; calm. Highly recommend this product, &amp; all it&#x27;s flavors.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! It was shipped very fast with no issues. The variety is wonderful. I can never get bored. The entire family uses this product. It is great for athletes to replace lost nutrients while training.Our teenage son has commented how good he feels after a long run and how he is sure it&#x27;s because of the Spirutien.</li>
    <li> This is my least favorite flavor I love almost all the others this one just taste too much like fake sugar I cant stand that stuff but put in the freezer its much better and weakens the sugar a bit.</li>
    <li> I use this as a diet aid, and it is great! I love the flavors, and it soothes the hunger. I drink this for breakfast and lunch, and then eat a regular dinner. I&#x27;m glad my niece discovered it!!!! I haven&#x27;t tried all the flavors, but I haven&#x27;t had one I didn&#x27;t like and I&#x27;ve tried the Vanilla, Pina Colada, Tangerine, Banana, and Blue Berry so far. I&#x27;m getting the peach, cookie dough, red fruit, chocolate, and chai latte. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than buying breakfast and lunch!!! The only thing I do differently than the package states is I add an extra 3 oz of soy milk to mix with it because it can be a bit thick.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase. I would buy from seller again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  This is the only flavor I&#x27;ve tried but I would like to try the vanilla.  I never got tired of it.  I didn&#x27;t have the discipline to do it for two meal replacements a day but I&#x27;m sure if anyone does that they will lose weight quickly.</li>
    <li> This is delicious when you mix this with strawberries! I love smoothies and can not have dairy. This is the best alterenative for replacing dairy!</li>
    <li> Love this brand, but I don&#x27;t like this flavor.</li>
    <li> a little ice, juice, and some berries or even just water this tastes nice after blending with some protein and vital nutrients</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for years and I always gladly come back to it. I add frozen blueberries or mixed berries, a spoon full of Fage yogurt and a dash of flaxseeds for a zestier taste and added fiber. With a bit less almond milk or liquid of your choise it gets the consistency of a frozen yougurt. Great tasting shake!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several of Spiru-Tein&#x27;s powder mixes. I like the ingredients in this one; most of them are really healthy. It has lots of exotic fruits that I&#x27;ve read about as being Super Foods but can&#x27;t buy here. The taste is like raspberry, and though I&#x27;m not a big raspberry fan, it&#x27;s okay. There&#x27;s another one that tastes really good (Cookies &amp; Cream) that I stopped using because it has wheat in it. I&#x27;ll save it to use in a pinch, but I will reorder this one. They&#x27;re all cheaper through Amazon.com than at our local health food stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make breakfast smoothies with almond milk, frozen fruit, and various additives of my own, like MSM crystals, inositol, silica drops, hemp hearts, diatomaceous earth, Garden of Life probiotics, etc., and I&#x27;m set for the morning. I also use Garden of Life powder drink mixes. They don&#x27;t taste as good as this one, but I like to give my tummy some variety.</li>
    <li> It has an ok taste and when you add fruit it can be very tasteful. Why I give 2 stars is because I bought this for energy, as it says it has. This did not give me any energy at all  and for the price I was extremely disappointed. I still have about 75% of it just sitting in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It tastes great, is good for you and can be added to shakes, oatmeal, and cereal. You must try it!!</li>
    <li> High protein gets the day started well and cuts any carb cravings. No &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; after taste in these Spiru-tein powder mixes.</li>
    <li> The exotic red fruit protein mix taste very good and great to mix with sweet fruits. Taste much better with light milk or soft smoothie flavored drinks.</li>
    <li> At first taste I was not excited. But, I tried mixing it and allowing it to sit in fridge an hour to overnight and it greatly improves. I mix it with coconut water or Bia5 fruit juice -very good. The hard chunks are actually fruit skins, which I prefer soft over crunchy -so the time in the fridge</li>
    <li> I have been on a high protein/lower carb diet for awhile now and found that it works best for me, but I&#x27;ve also discovered that I am sensitive to animal products such as whey and meat, so my search for a protein shake has been pretty varied. I visited my local healthfood store and picked up a myriad of protein shake single serving packets to taste-test. The Exotic Red Fruit is probably one of my most favorite Spirutein flavors. It&#x27;s got a pleasant berry-ish flavor, and goes down easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make it 2 scoops at a time in my Blender Bottle for 28 grams of protein, and I mix it in water, and very rarely in rice or coconut milk to save calories. I think it tastes great in water, but for those who prefer a creamier consistency, I can see why mixing in milk as suggested would be appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is there always seems to be a bit of the powder that sticks at the bottom of my bottle and refuses to be integrated with the water and the rest of my shake. It&#x27;s a negligable amount (maybe 1/4 - 1/2 tsp), but it still doesn&#x27;t mix quite as well as some of the whey proteins I&#x27;ve had in the past. However, I still use this as my go-to since it&#x27;s not as gritty as my hemp protein.</li>
    <li> Wonderful taste and mixes well in my shaker. Mix it with my cocoa and greens organics. Simply love it.  I get 1 every month.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, my wife and I have been using Spiru-tein as a vegan protein supplement for over a year now. We really like it and this flavor is the best!</li>
    <li> Great! Already re-ordering before I finish the first container.</li>
    <li> It was delicious and came right away.  I used it every morning and re-ordered more.  Makes the morning smoothie much tastier.</li>
    <li> Be extremely careful if you have any kind of kidney problems using this product I have spent the last five days with a bladder and a kidney infection.&lt;br /&gt; I realize after searching on the Internet the other day that this is what has been causing my problems that I am having now so if you have any kind of kidney pain are susceptible to bladder infections I would recommend you don&#x27;t use this product.&lt;br /&gt; Also the soy in this product if you are a woman and have hormonal problems it may cause you to have problems with estrogen overload.&lt;br /&gt; I will say the flavors are good they&#x27;re red fruit and the blueberry cream our taste very well but if you have tendency towards any kind of UTIs be very wary.&lt;br /&gt; Until I can flush the rest of this out of my body I don&#x27;t think my kidney infection will go away.</li>
    <li> Flavor is reminiscent of Pepto Bismol.</li>
