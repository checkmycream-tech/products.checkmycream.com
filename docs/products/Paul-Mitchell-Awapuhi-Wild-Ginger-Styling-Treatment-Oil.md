<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it.  Hate that you took it off the market.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 7 years and it&#x27;s still one of my all time favorites. It&#x27;s lightweight, non greasy and smells amazing!! I use this as a heat protector for flat ironing my hair and it also provides just enough sheen for my curly hair days.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recently used this product on me the last time I came in for a trim.  I love how it kept all of my fly-aways in check!  You don&#x27;t even have to use a whole lot.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is exactly as it says in the description. Smells great and works amazing on my hair. I look foward to buying the shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have reordered this twice!  This product was suggested to my by a hair stylist. I told her I wanted something lightweight, moisturizing and frizz fighting. This has all the above. The formula is awesome! It&#x27;s not greesy and is quickly absorbed by my hair.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff everyday...love it!</li>
    <li> Awapuhi Wild Ginger Styling Treatment Oil is a wonderful way to healthy looking hair, even if it&#x27;s extremely brittle or damage.  This is a miracle in a bottle, and is a much better product than the Super Skinny Serum or Gloss Drops (both Paul Mitchell products).  I would buy this stuff over and over and over again, truly fabulous and with an amazing smell you cannot turn this away.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil.  I use it everyday before I blow-dry.  I prefer Awapuhi oil to any other including Morrocan. Use your Amazon Prime for free shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this product I can definitely tell a difference</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used.  It can turn straw into gold without weighing the hair down or giving it a greasy feel.  I will never be without a bottle of it!</li>
    <li> I am a PM person. My stylist uses PM color products. I use PM shampoos, conditioners, styling products and styling tools. My PM smoothing iron is my best friend. I used skinny serum  for years with quick slip because my stylist told me to and it works. Now this is even better. Smells great, even lighter feeling than skinny and sooo great for blow drying, straightening, flat ironing, curling or whatever I do that day! This new line of products is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> The styling treatment oil was ok, nothing special. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I have used others that have worked much better. The stuff smells pretty good though.</li>
    <li> product as described, thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this product to keep my locks looking and felling good! it an execellent product  that amazed me I get a lot of compliments on my look!</li>
    <li> An amazing and wonderfully scented hair oil that I swear by.  Living in humidity makes this essential if you want smooth straight hair or soft curls. Rub on legs and arms for smoothness!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky and smelling wonderful daily.</li>
    <li> My son is bi-racial and I was referred to this product by a friend. This product is WELL worth the price! Immediately his hair became very soft and easy to maintain the way I want it. I love it! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> One of the best leave in serums that really works.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, works great for my hair, tames the frizz quite well!</li>
    <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily (although I don&#x27;t put it on my bangs)</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!! Only one I buy for the last 5-6 years. Smooths away the frizzies after styling.</li>
    <li> I am a male and bought this because I have natural curly hair, which tends to be frizzy on the sides.  I use it after I get out of the shower and it helps keep my hair smelling nice and not as frizzy.</li>
    <li> Like the smell and the soft feel it leaves the hair.</li>
    <li> Best product for ironing hair that I have ever used...plus always get &#x27;your hair smells terrific&#x27; comments. Buy th small sample size and use to refill for purse or travel.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  The only thing that makes my hair feel silky smooth and straightens too!</li>
    <li> I have very long, very corse, very curly hair and my stylist starting using this on me sometime ago and it is fantastic! It can be used on wet or dry hair, is light weight, it&#x27;s like when you put lotion on your hands to keep them soft, this keeps your hair soft and nourished and I frequently blow dry my very curly hair straight and apply this before and after and it keeps it straight even in humidity. I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to buy in on amazon because it is too expensive to buy it from my stylist and I can&#x27;t even buy it in my local beauty supply story.</li>
    <li> My hair is very long and thick with quite a bit of dry dead ends. I love keeping my hair long, but it&#x27;s difficult when you need to keep cutting your hair to get rid of the dead ends. I know that blow drying and straightening my hair contributes greatly to this, but my hair is crazy when I don&#x27;t do these things.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different products for smoothing hair and preventing split ends; my mother is a hair product fanatic because she has been dying her hair blonde every two weeks for 20+ years, giving her hair the consistency of hay. Needless to say she is on an endless quest to make her hair... like hair. Of course with so much damage nothing ever helps, meaning I usually end up with much of these products. During her last visit, she left this treatment oil in my bathroom and I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;My first thought was \\&quot;This smells sooooooo good!\\&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t last too long, but its nice when you apply it. It glided through my hair really nicely, which is cool because usually the ends of my hair snag to each other. When I went to blow dry and straighten it after, I was surprised at how easily my straightener glided through my hair! Because of this, I was left with hardly any dents in my hair when it was done, and when it was done my hair was super soft.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff, and I definitely need to get another bottle. I don&#x27;t usually have staple hair products I swear by, but this is has now become one.</li>
    <li> They use this product on me at the salon and they also sell it but it costs at least $30 there so this price is much better.  It is an oil based product that is very helpful for dry or fizzed hair.  I see them use it on all sorts of hair at the salon so I am glad to find a way to get it cheaper.</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Oil - This is amazing for your hair.  It stops frizz, adds shine, makes for beautiful, beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave in oil for the hair after styling. It creates a shine for the hair and makes your hair light and manageable.</li>
    <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t be interested in an &#x27;oil&#x27; on my hair, as its fine and curly and easily weighed down, but this was a great product that left my hair really silky. The only downside is I did notice it pretty flat the next day, where normally with just my mousse or other leave in products, this wouldn&#x27;t be the case.</li>
    <li> Really love this styling oil, not too heavy and provides a nice shine to the hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Quick service. Product exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair light with a non greasy feeling. No heavy build up. Hair still has bounce and a fresh look.</li>
    <li> The best part about this styling oil is that it gets rid of static without making your hair greasy or weighted down. By far the best styling oil I have used so far and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use it for my hair also for my puppy, the smell so good last on his hair than using perfume</li>
    <li> Bought this serum after my stylist used it on me. Makes my hair feel super soft and hydrated. I have medium to fine hair so 1 to 2 pumps will usually do it for me. Using too much can make hair a bit oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product ever since my hair stylist tried it on me. It isn&#x27;t easy to find. I have to order it online. Haven&#x27;t tried the other products in the line, but I&#x27;d love to.</li>
    <li> The Best Gel I have ever applied to my hair and will use always !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for months and I can feel the difference in my hair in every use! I strongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My stylist gave me a sample and Im hooked. Love that is smooths, softens and takes away frizzies without weighing your hair down or looking greasy.. A little goes a long way. I love the clean scent of ginger...its like nothing ive ever used before.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy/curly (long curls) and was damaged because of highlights. So I was having problems with frizz, very dry ends and curls with no shape. I bought 3 products that definitely changed this scenario: Pantene Pro-V Silky Moisture Whip, Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Styling Treatment Oil and It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave -in Plus Keratin. So, my hair now is just amazing: healthy, shiny and beautifully wavy. But I cant say which product is the best, since I started using them together. This is what I do: I shampoo and condition my hair. I use Its a 10 miracle Leave in and comb it. When its not so wet, I use Pantene Pro-V Silky Moisture and just use my fingers to distribute the product -- I dont use a comb like it suggests. When its drying but still damp I use Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Styling Treatment Oil (which is SO amazing --- Best oil I have ever used. It smells great; It doesnt make my hair oily and it hydrates it a lot making it shiny.)&lt;br /&gt;My waves are more defined because of Pantene Pro-V silky --- it has a good hold, but doesnt make hair look like it has gel or any product on. Its really amazing. I have used Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream Whip, which is also awesome, but its more expensive.</li>
    <li> I basically just like this for the smell. It is amazing! Sometimes I just rub it on my arms like lotion and I can smell it all day. It makes my hair feel softer and it keeps it smooth.</li>
    <li> Initially, my hair is smooth and shiny. However, over time it seems to have a drying affect. Good for occasional use.</li>
    <li> and I have used many.  I apply it after I dry my hair but before using the flat iron.  Dont over apply.  A little is all you need.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have been using it for over a year and can&#x27;t live without. It!  I mix it with curl booster when I do curly hair or use straight for straight hair.  It really makes hair smooth and soft - tames the frizzies.</li>
    <li> I love using this serum! You only need a very small amount, it smells great, and makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Awapuhi line in general. The smell is awesome and this stuff helps cut down on frizz. I have very fine curly hair so I usually use a few pumps of this before I put in any other styling product.</li>
    <li> I love this product I&amp;#34;m a loyal fan of it! I wasn&#x27;t happy that it came already open and with no lid at all.  I thought that was generic and totally unprofessional.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I really, really like it. This particular purchase is actually a gift and I think the recipient will really like it too. Just a small amount (dime sized) will do and it does not make your hair greasy but instead shiny and silky.</li>
    <li> way too &#x27;fragrant&#x27; - has a very strong perfumey smell that makes my eyes smart. Lots of chemicals in this product and dried my hair out. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I would recommend to everyone.  it works as a detangled for my hair too.  I put it on after I towel dry my hair and then brushing through is easier.</li>
    <li> I live in Taiwan and my stylist used AWG products on my hair and I was so in love with the smell, I asked to put some on my hands just so I could sit in the chair and smell it up close. I have a sort of wild cut, short in the back and long in the front so I need a product that is going to give me that beach look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the treatment oil and the sea spray. Using both on wet hair and leaving to air dry gets the results I want. But...the real selling point for me was the smell. Very unique...smells like surf. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s a great product to help keep hair healthy when you use a hot hie dryer every day!</li>
    <li> This oil does a great job especially for flat-ironing and the scent is intriguing.  I can say the same about the&lt;br /&gt;rest of the products in this line too.</li>
    <li> One of my co-workers suggested this Paul Mitchell treatment oil.  She was correct when she said it keeps your hair undamaged from heat styling, as well as sleek, soft, and smelling great.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, either.  I suppose if I used too much that might happen, but with just a few drops in the palm of my hand and rubbing the palms together gently, you should get more than satisfactory results. My co-worker warned me that I could only purchase this in hair salons, but, as usual, I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great in my hair!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0042X83UA Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Moisturizing Lather Shampoo, 33.8 oz / liter]]I have been using this product now for a while...Its been over a year and i have used the shampoo, intensive condition, cream rinse and the small bottles of intensive treatment drops. My hair is full of body with shine.  Every where i go people are always complimenting me on my hair.  Love the product i will always use this product.</li>
    <li> I have used some thermal protection hair products and I have found this one to be the best. It leaves my hair shiny and silky, I also like that it&#x27;s not heavy on silicone. This one and the living proof line have been the only ones that has actually made my thin hair nicer. Most products don&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> Improved texture of hair. Absorbsed easily.</li>
    <li> Loved it. I want more.  I love the books.  Great idea.  Titus is perfect for the role of detective Bosch.</li>
    <li> Others have had a wonderful experience with this product, but it was not a right fit for my hair. It left it too oily and also caused a negative reaction for the skin on my face/neck.  I ended up giving it away after a few uses.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair silky and smooth. And, that&#x27;s says a lot as I live in a high humidity state!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing my stylist use it. I have vey thin,fine hair. This makes it soft and shiny without weighing it down. Smells great also! I use one pump and massage into wet hair.  You only need 1 pump so a bottle should last a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is great for smoothing hair that is already dry. When used on wet hair, hair dries in a tamer smoother fashion. Wonderful scent. Would use it just for the scent ! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wasn&#x27;t sure what smell to expect since I didn&#x27;t really know what ginger smelled like.  It was like a woodsy smell.  I like the way it makes my hair feel though.</li>
    <li> I bought this styling treatment as a gift for a family member who has used it previously; however, it is hard to find in our local beauty salon(s) and beauty supply shops. The one shop I did find it had it priced at 1/3 higher than Amazon, so I snatched it up quickly!!</li>
    <li> This oil is a life saver!  Even though I don&#x27;t actually style my hair (blow drying and all that), I use this product after the shower as a leave-in conditioner.  Just one squirt covers all of my ends.  And my hair feels fuller, smells great, and is protected against the Miami sun and heat.  Thank you, Paul Mitchell!</li>
    <li> I have bleached my hair so needless to say it needs a lot of moisture. I was using things like perfect for platinum which has been amazing. After that I would use this and could not figure out why my hair would feel much more dry afterwords. The alcohol... Same with biosilk. IMO stay away from products with alcohol if you want actual moisture in your hair</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and product exactly as described. I love this product! It helps keep my hair soft and protected from damage when blow drying. I have colored hair and it really makes a difference here too. Hair stays healthy. Thanks!</li>
    <li> A small amount goes a long way! Made my hair feel softer after the first use. Great at detangeling too!</li>
    <li> Well worth every penny n lasts quite long (2yrs atleast). I apply 2 drops of it to my shampooed n wet hair with my fingers on the days I dont use the conditioner n it makes my hair soft, shiny n silky. Smells great too. I have an oily scalp so I shampoo almost everyday n this one doesn&#x27;t make my hair any greasy; n on the contrary- maintains it moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely live this product!</li>
    <li> I love it works well put kind of small for the price.  but it seems to be helping</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have found. I can go several days without washing my hair, or wash everyday, this gives softness and shine!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, I HAVE USED IT BEFORE. I USE THE LAVENDAR AND MINT SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER WITH THIS PRODUCT. I LIVE IN A HOT CLIMATE AND THIS IS EXCELLENT WITH MY HAIR</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair so healthy but you don&#x27;t have to use much.  too much makes it heavy and greasy</li>
    <li> Have to put it in last after all other products or other products doesn&#x27;t work with frizzy hair</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants to have soft and silky hair. You must have the whole system in order to achieve the results that this great product offers. It is a professional line tht you will not find in stores and it is worth the money. I used this on my biracial daughter&#x27;s hair and it gave her the silkiest hair she has every had in her life. Try it you will love it.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for quit awhile now. Works great for split ends and actually a detaingler to. Leaves my hair smelling great and soft. Awesome for humidity and static. I jus love this item!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff !  I got hooked when my hairstylist used it in my hair that was beyond damaged ! A little goes a long way is what she told me I didnt believe her since I have a lot and when I say a lot I mean a lot of hair 2 pumps of shampoo and a couple of drops of the conditioner and my hair is so smooth and soft! The big bottle of shampoo and conditioner have last me almost 2 months. I would definitely recommend this to anyone !</li>
    <li> This is a good product but I think I like the Chi version a little better for control and shine.</li>
    <li> It is not heavy and greasy and it tames my frizzy hair in the worst humidity.  I am thrilled with this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it really gets the knots out of my hair and I love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle - so obviously, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts a very long time - so it may seem expensive at first, but I use it 2 to 3x/week and lasts over six months.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I have found that was able to tame my curly frizz.  And it smells great too!</li>
    <li> I have fine long hair and this stuff is perfect for the ends and keeping flyaways down and manageable. I&#x27;ve used other hair oils and they are so thick and leave my hair looking oily and wet. This product is very light and leaves my hair soft and frizz at bay!!</li>
    <li> This Oil has changed my Hair forever. I never thought it could feel this way! Thank you Paul Mitchell for this great product!</li>
    <li> The awapuwi serum is great on controlling my hair. I use it every night on my damp hair to give it a smoother finish.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. A small amount goes a long way, and it helps tame my frizz and give my hair a nice shine. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted for a cheaper price. Definitely will be coming back for more when this one ends.</li>
    <li> I swear by the Awapuhi line. Love the way it smells and the way it makes my hair look. Could never see myself using a different line anytime soon!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I am using the shampoo, conditioner, keratin treatment, and now this! 2 pumps and i blowdry then when dry for me 1 more pump before heat (curler, flat iron, etc) -- my hair is shiny, doesn&#x27;t look oily, smells wonderful - i was using 12 Benefits which is also great but wanted one product vs. 3 and this WINS!! just buy it -- you will love it!</li>
    <li> Of all the Paul Mitchell products this is my FAVORITE. I put a small pump of this in my hands and rub them together then rub it all over my dry hair before I flat iron it, and it makes it silky smooth and never oily. As a bonus this stuff smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Oil. It helps my hair stay smooth and moisturized; free of fly aways. It smells amazing too! I&#x27;m so happy I got this product for such a great deal. About $10 less than if I were to by it from my stylist. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has dry hair or fly aways.</li>
    <li> I havae used this product for about two years now.  I have tried others but find this one to be my favorite.  It is very light and makes my hair look healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Paul Mitchell wild ginger luxury line since it came out. I love all of the products in the complete line. The cost in salons is so marked up. I use so much that it is more cost effective to order from amazon.</li>
    <li> P M Awapuhi works great to protect hair from blow drying and flat iron. My hair stylist had me to try it. Now I&#x27;m hooked</li>
    <li> Love love love. Frizzy bleached hair is now smooth. And it&#x27;s not oily</li>
    <li> I love this product of  texture and smell. It keeps my hair smooth and light.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Replaced my favorite shine product. I have been a loyal customer for over 5 years now. Goes on smoothe, not greasy or oily on hair or hands, lasts long. Does not weigh hair down at all! I usually buy it at the school but I cannot drive right now. Definitely get what you pay for here, expensive but so worth it! Perfect!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product came so fast in the mail very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really smooths the hair shaft and provides optimal shine when styling. Plan to purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser and its been love ever since! If you would like a smoothing serum without the heavy, greasy feeling this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I like this oil I think it helps keep my hair healthy where I have it colored now. Thank you</li>
    <li> Light but gets the job done with an interesting scent.  Not greasy. Has been helpful to tame the frizzies and add softness.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, but very smoothing product.  It helps with the frizz and makes for an overall healthy feel to my hair.</li>
    <li> this is a great product, tames the flyaways and makes your silky smooth and shiny but even better is the scent, OMG the scent is AMAZING! i am obsessed with it. but i think you have to really like ginger to like it otherwise you&#x27;ll probably think its gross. but if you like ginger, you will absolutely love this product line</li>
    <li> An amazing product. Love how it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> Part of the three step process helping my hair,, Awapuhi wild ginger shampoo, crime rinse, styling oil, with weekly intense treatment</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I need more,,,</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought this. Works well without being greasy. Just pricy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful light weight oil that smooths my hair and makes it shine.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time, appropriately packed. Good vendor to do business with. Saved me money too!</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly hair that gets dry easily and this oil works great to keep my hair moisturized after straightening. I seriously love it. Will definitely need to order more.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff. Gives my hair the look that I&#x27;ve been trying to get for years. Really works wonders</li>
    <li> It does smell good! It really does manage your hair and you really don&#x27;t need a shine spray cause it already makes your hair shine. I use a little when my hair is almost completely dry and then finish drying it and then put some on while I&#x27;m putting my pomade on, I really kinda mix it together when I do that. I do recommend it!!!!!</li>
