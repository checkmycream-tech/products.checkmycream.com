<ol>
    <li> The best toothpaste ever.  Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s off shelves.  Have to go online, so we buy it in the 6-pak!</li>
    <li> I love the taste of this toothpaste, plus it builds enamel.  The price was great as well. So glad I bought it thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase gain, not too fond of the taste compared to others.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years.  No more messy tubes and wasted toothpaste.</li>
    <li> If you like brushing your teeth, this is the product for you.  Ladies and gentlemen... Crest has nailed it!  My teeth are so clean after I brush them... sometimes I have another bowl of cereal after I brush... just so I can brush my teeth again!</li>
    <li> This is the only type of toothpaste I will use. And I&#x27;m not a picky person! In addition to the smooth texture, I love how easy it is to not make a mess or waste the toothpaste. Plus, no more squeezing. This review is annoying me, but it&#x27;s all true.</li>
    <li> I can only use gel toothpaste because regular toothpaste tends to make me gag. I like a little mint, but no too intense because that makes me sneeze! This is the best (and pretty much only) toothpaste out there that works for me, and I love the Scope addition. It is well nigh impossible to find this toothpaste in the stores nowadays (and even drugstore dot com has stopped carrying it). Thank goodness for Amazon coming to the rescue and having it available.</li>
    <li> Good, inexpensive and highly recommended.  Great price. At the store the pricing is twice  as much per unit.  It&#x27;s well worth buying this.</li>
    <li> Favorite toothpaste for years!  Glad Amazon finally carries this product.  Only our local Walmart stocks this so whenever we would see it there, we would have to buy about 5-6 at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other toothpastes out there with the build-in mouthwash but this does not have the tooth whitening ingredients which causes my sensitive teeth to ache/hurt at times.  Teeth and breath feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; after using this.  No more need to use a separate mouthwash in addition to this.  I keep it at my desk at work too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m picky when it comes to toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using this brand/type for a few years now. Seems all the stores have stopped carrying it for some reason so I turned to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect on a subscription. Get 6 tubes every 4 months and not have to keep looking or find an alternative. And it was cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Thankfully Amazon is here! This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Always hated toothpaste tubes.  These work great but are sometimes hard to find.  These 6 will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Ok toothpaste, tastes like scope.  It is in a nice small container.</li>
    <li> My husband is picky about toothpaste. This is the brand and flavor he prefers. I like the continence of getting a a 6 pack so i have it on hand as i have multiple bathrooms and my husband takes a container to work with him. the flip container makes it nice when traveling and the bottle is easy enough for our son to get his own tooth paste with out making the mess he and his father ;) use to with the tubes.</li>
    <li> Does this one have the actual gel. I bought some in a batch that wasn&#x27;t gel its white paste. I have an autistic son who will only brush with gel out of these containers</li>
    <li> The best part about this toothpaste: you only need one hand to open/close it. The toothpaste also tastes good and does its job well. What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this product in stores anymore, but it&#x27;s one I have loved since I&#x27;ve tried it! Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t completely going away, but that&#x27;s whar usually happens when they are no longer on the shelves.</li>
    <li> This mint is my favorite of all the flavors. The price is as cheap as anywhere and the convenience of auto ship saves me time and trouble. This is my favorite of all the toothpastes like this. I have tried most of them and this is my favorite. Since it was hit and miss in the store, this is very convenient.</li>
    <li> Guys, lets face it - chicks dig minty breath. They don&#x27;t like coffee or hamburger breath. They hate liquor breath. This toothpaste helps with all of those. It won&#x27;t help with cigarette breath, so don&#x27;t smoke if you ever want a date. Try this toothpaste. You&#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> Tastes good and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my mouth as all other toothpastes do.  It&#x27;s hard to get where I live.</li>
    <li> I love the flavor of this toothpaste and so easy to use in the squeeze container. Will be back for more...</li>
    <li> Cannot buy these in the store any more.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The Crest toothpaste is great and the container is very convient to use!! I will buy this great product again!!!</li>
    <li> Handy container works well with electric brush.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has been my choice for years. I hope they never discontinue it! Our whole family loves it. The taste is not too strong or minty.</li>
    <li> U bought this toothpaste based on the reviews and I am so glad I did! My favorite part is that it foes not foam a whole lot! And my teeth feel cleaner than ever before! Definitely will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding this particular toothpaste.  I can get the white one, but I like the green one (Scope Liquid Gel).</li>
    <li> Amazon did not like my original review, not sure why. However the Crest toothpaste in the bottle has the following advantages over toothpaste tubes. They are easy too use, not messy like an open tube of paste. The applicator end is small and puts just enough product on the brush. The product appears more staple and does not leak to the sides of the brush. When you close the top of the container, there is no buildup or leakage. Your sink top does not display tube reside with this container. The flavor is excellent .</li>
