      <li>;)</li>
      <li>9 dollars total would be better than 12.50 if it was cheaper</li>
      <li>It really smells like candy canes!</li>
      <li>Funny side story: scratched myself and got a minty surprise.</li>
      <li>As to the scent, at first I did not even notice it - it was overpowered by gel nail polish scent, but it became noticeable after a couple of hours -</li>
      <li>I received tons of compliments and felt very festive.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think it smells too much like a candy cane</li>
      <li>it goes on really well</li>
      <li>For about 12 hours when I touched my face it actually felt cool like menthol.</li>
      <li>I am super excited to layer it over pink for valentines day and blue for 4th of July.  </li>
      <li>O wow this polish really smells like peppermint</li>
      <li>and you definitely have to get pure acetone to get it off!</li>
      <li>Thinking this will look amazing over red or green for Christmas.</li>
      <li>has big chunks of glitter &amp; looks exactly like the    picture</li>
      <li>I topped off with a clear coat I had laying around.</li>
      <li>It goes on clear with flecks of glitter in it.</li>
      <li>I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation of putting the polish in the middle of your nail and spreading from there, which was very helpful.</li>
      <li>I might have picked too light of a base color (very light grey), I think it would look more striking with a darker color, navy, dark grey or green.  </li>
      <li>Love this, hard to remove which means it also is long wearing.</li>
      <li>Strong scent of peppermint and really hard to remove!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not bad, but as I am not a great fan of minty scents I could live without.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care too much, I still like the look, but I am afraid that the clumps will affect how long this entire assembly will stay put :).  </li>

    <li> This is so cute! Looks great over pastel pink!</li>
    <li> Fun holiday color. Smells nice. I Love it.</li>
    <li> I just pt in on today over the gel nail polish and topped with gel top coat, and I like the results.  I might have picked too light of a base color (very light grey), I think it would look more striking with a darker color, navy, dark grey or green.  Also it has plenty of larger pieces, which is a mixed blessing, as they tend to clump together and give a lumpy look when you look at your nail from the side.  I don&#x27;t care too much, I still like the look, but I am afraid that the clumps will affect how long this entire assembly will stay put :).  I am aiming for a week, we&#x27;ll see.    As to the scent, at first I did not even notice it - it was overpowered by gel nail polish scent, but it became noticeable after a couple of hours - it&#x27;s not bad, but as I am not a great fan of minty scents I could live without.</li>
    <li> It actually does smell like peppermint! Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Love this holiday themed &amp; scented nail polish, can&#x27;t wait to wear it for the seasons to come! Arrived quickly, well packed &amp; as described.</li>
    <li> O wow this polish really smells like peppermint i have it on now it goes on really well has big chunks of glitter &amp; looks exactly like the    picture it just has on hang up it    needs to be cheaper 9 dollars total would be better than 12.50 if it was cheaper i could gwt 3 bottles at once hopefully the seller will lower the yprice. But all in all it&#x27;s a great polish.</li>
    <li> My husband loved the scent, I loved the glitter. I layered this polish over mint colored polish for one week and over grey for another. I received tons of compliments and felt very festive. I am super excited to layer it over pink for valentines day and blue for 4th of July.  Funny side story: scratched myself and got a minty surprise. ;)</li>
    <li> Love this, hard to remove which means it also is long wearing. Be sure to use base coat as instructed.</li>
    <li> This polish is AMAZING.  You need at LEAST 2 coats of it though and you definitely have to get pure acetone to get it off! Definitely a great product, though!</li>
    <li> I love this polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I painted my  nails green with a random polish I had, then added two layers of the candy cane crush polish. Keep in mind you&#x27;ll want to kind of move the confetti flakes around a bit with the brush. Also, wait until each layer of polish is dry before adding another. I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation of putting the polish in the middle of your nail and spreading from there, which was very helpful. (You&#x27;ll see a paper with tips on it in your package.) I topped off with a clear coat I had laying around. It has been five days and not even one chip! The durability is better than I had dared to hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t dock stars for it, but the peppermint scent is really unnecessary and actually bothered me. For about 12 hours when I touched my face it actually felt cool like menthol.</li>
    <li> Another perfect polish from KBShimmer! 2 coats, perfect for x-mas or valentines day!</li>
    <li> Love the glitter pieces because their not too blingy and they look really great over pink and white. Thinking this will look amazing over red or green for Christmas. The only downside is that it takes work to get this to spread evenly.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need anything else and you can smell the peppermint!</li>
    <li> Did not like. It all clumped in one spot. Hard to get glitter pieces out. Would not recommend!!</li>
    <li> I bought a kerry green polish for Christmas and plan on using this as a topper. I really don&#x27;t think it smells too much like a candy cane but it is incredible cute!</li>
    <li> One layer over any color. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a holiday thing. Asfar as the scent, I haven&#x27;t been paying attention. 3</li>
    <li> Delivered very quickly. It really smells like candy canes! It will be fun to use it with many backgrounds, but looks great by itself.</li>
    <li> HEr nail polishes are fabulous! Great over so many colors. Great for Valentines too</li>
    <li> Strong scent of peppermint and really hard to remove!</li>
    <li> This polish is pretty cute. It goes on clear with flecks of glitter in it. I do smell the candy cane scent, but I also smell the scent of polish/paint, so I wouldn&#x27;t advise sniffing it. Not while wet, anyway. XP</li>
    <li> I love this! I love the smell and the design.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite nail polish. I am definitely purchasing more nail polish from KBShimmer! I really love it!</li>
