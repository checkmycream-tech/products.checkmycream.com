      <li>, I have been stopped in stores, and asked what perfume I am wearing, but in all good faith I could not advise people to spend money on a designer quality product that has no staying power.  </li>

      <li>I fell in love immediately.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite</li>
      <li>Love the scent of Vanitas Versace and every time I wear it</li>
      <li>a lovely souvenir to bring home from Italy.</li>
      <li>I love this scent</li>
      <li>This perfume will get you so many compliments, from men and women, people will love it every time you wear it.</li>
      <li>i have had many lady&#x27;s ask what i was waring and the guys tell me &amp;</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!!!</li>
      <li>The price was right and the perfume was just exceptional for any occation that we went to.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t stop loving it since the first spray!</li>
      <li>This is the second time I have ordered Vanitas by Versace thru Amazon it is my favorite cologne and comes in a beautiful gold package.  </li>
      <li>I chose to get the Eau de Parfum because I couldn&#x27;t afford the Parfum and the Eau de Toilette version of perfumes fade very quickly.</li>
      <li>this smells great with a lasting smell.</li>
      <li>I first received a gift set of Vanitas and fell in love with the scent.  </li>
      <li>I use Ralph Lauren Romantic, that has staying power, and while I liked the Versace better, I was stunned to find out that after applying the PERFUME which should be concentrated, there was no scent within an hour.  </li>
      <li>It may very well be my favorite.</li>
      <li>I really love this perfume, the scent is gorgeous, but I can only give it 2 stars, really it should get 1, because it fades into nothing within an hour.  </li>
      <li>And he&#x27;s super picky about scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this at any department store and i payed twice as much when I bought it at the Airport Duty Free shop.</li>
      <li>Good and faint scent gives me a good day.</li>
      <li>Sumptuious and rich, this smell is sure to have everyone trying to get next to you!</li>
      <li>I was shopping in the Rome airport&#x27;s duty free shop, looking for a new scent.</li>
      <li>The scent fades quickly, though, so I don&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is the real stuff!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong with the beautiful fragrance!</li>
      <li>and I knew if I was patience and waited until I got back home that I would be able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>I have actually drenched myself in this, and it gets many compliments</li>
      <li>Fresh scent and recommended to me by attendant at perfume store.</li>
      <li>it was exactly what I had purchased.</li>
      <li>I first tested this Parfum when I was on a cruise and when we went ashore</li>
      <li>and his company were very helpful and knowledgeable</li>
      <li>However, Vanitas is a very nice-smelling perfume.</li>
      <li>Its the real deal.</li>
      <li>Normally stick to a couple brands I really like ....</li>
      <li>I enjoyed it on my long flight back to the US.</li>
      <li>It is my new go to scent.</li>
      <li>The lady helping me asked me if I had smelled the new scent by Versace called Vanitas from Italy.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to any woman who value quality, classy perfume.</li>
      <li>I priced it at the local shops and just wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the price</li>
      <li>I will describe it as a soft scent, that stays on for the day.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be a return customer the next time I need a new bottle of Vanitas!</li>
      <li>I get multiple compliments from men, women &amp; even complete strangers.</li>
      <li>I was surprised because it didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Smell like the Vanitas I had purchased from Macy&#x27;s a year prior!</li>
      <li>but I have to use more than I usually do with my other scents.</li>
      <li>We were looking for nice but not as expensive as the boutique French fragrances.</li>

<li> Unfortunately, with perfume it is entirely necessary to try it on first, it will smell different on everyone.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t acutally open it yet as I still have some from my previous order.  </li>
<li> Not the imitation stuff.</li>
<li> Amazon didn&#x27;t let me down 2 times around.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it does tend to fade with a few hours.</li>
<li> It is not strong or overpowering.</li>
<li> Has a complex smell.</li>
<li> Not good at all!  </li>
<li> so it became a very expensive bottle of perfume</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> I was shopping in the Rome airport&#x27;s duty free shop, looking for a new scent. The lady helping me asked me if I had smelled the new scent by Versace called Vanitas from Italy. I fell in love immediately. She described it as sensual. I will describe it as a soft scent, that stays on for the day. I enjoyed it on my long flight back to the US. My son thought it smelled great on me. And he&#x27;s super picky about scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a lovely souvenir to bring home from Italy. It may very well be my favorite. Along with the espresso.</li>
    <li> Happy to say we will be reordering from now on with amazon. Its the real deal. Not the imitation stuff. The price is unbeatable compare to the online mall stores are asking.</li>
    <li> Came in intact n it was exactly what I had purchased. Thank you</li>
    <li> I first received a gift set of Vanitas and fell in love with the scent.  I chose to get the Eau de Parfum because I couldn&#x27;t afford the Parfum and the Eau de Toilette version of perfumes fade very quickly. Unfortunately, this one also fades very quickly.  Also, the scent is different from the one in the gift box I received.</li>
    <li> I loved it! I was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I think most Versace fragrances smell the same, unfortunately, so this scent gets no props for originality. However, Vanitas is a very nice-smelling perfume. The scent fades quickly, though, so I don&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend and while I am not going to pretend to pick out all the notes, I can say it smells absolutely great. We were looking for nice but not as expensive as the boutique French fragrances. My only complaint is that it does tend to fade with a few hours. Unfortunately, with perfume it is entirely necessary to try it on first, it will smell different on everyone. But...I would buy online to save on money.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this after trying it at one of the local Nordstorm. Turns out you get what you pay for. The quality is just not the same. The only reason I gave it a three is because it is still the only  and closest option to the one i had tried that i could afford with my budget.</li>
    <li> Adam was wonderful and i love my perfume!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He and his company were very helpful and knowledgeable and I would definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product wife was very happy</li>
    <li> I love this scent but I have to agree with others&#x27; reviews in the fact I don&#x27;t think it lasts long.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered Vanitas by Versace thru Amazon it is my favorite cologne and comes in a beautiful gold package.  I haven&#x27;t acutally open it yet as I still have some from my previous order.  I just didn&#x27;t want to take the chance of running out of it.  You can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere than thru Amazon.  I first tested this Parfum when I was on a cruise and when we went ashore I priced it at the local shops and just wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the price and I knew if I was patience and waited until I got back home that I would be able to find it on Amazon.  Amazon didn&#x27;t let me down 2 times around.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!!!</li>
    <li> The price was right and the perfume was just exceptional for any occation that we went to. A lot of compliments</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for a couple of years from other retailers and paid double the price that I paid on Amazon. Love the scent of Vanitas Versace and every time I wear it I get multiple compliments from men, women &amp; even complete strangers. I get asked what perfume I have on all the time. I will definitely be a return customer the next time I need a new bottle of Vanitas! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> GREAT!!!!! I will be getting more of this!!</li>
    <li> Because you said you would pay the custom 15.42 charge I had to pay at the post office you haven&#x27;t as yet so it became a very expensive bottle of perfume</li>
    <li> This perfume will get you so many compliments, from men and women, people will love it every time you wear it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite and I wear it all the time. Absolutely love it! Can&#x27;t go wrong with the beautiful fragrance!</li>
    <li> Is as described. Love this fragrance. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Has become a very favorite .... Normally stick to a couple brands I really like ....this smells great with a lasting smell.</li>
    <li> Fresh scent and recommended to me by attendant at perfume store.</li>
    <li> It is my new go to scent. It is not strong or overpowering. It lasts all day but I have to use more than I usually do with my other scents. I also like that I get noticed when I am wearing it.</li>
    <li> oh my how wonderful the sent.  i have had many lady&#x27;s ask what i was waring and the guys tell me &amp;#34;you smell good what is that I want to get it for my wife&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> What can I say? Good and faint scent gives me a good day. Can&#x27;t stop loving it since the first spray!</li>
    <li> This is the best fragrance I smelled so far from Versace. I highly recommend this product to any woman who value quality, classy perfume.</li>
    <li> The 1 I purchase was my 2nd I just luv it I wear it everywhere</li>
    <li> The perfume is great. Got it for my moms bday. Came in a timely manner. I would suggest it to anyone. Has a complex smell.</li>
    <li> This was a steal! I couldn&#x27;t find this at any department store and i payed twice as much when I bought it at the Airport Duty Free shop. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Sumptuious and rich, this smell is sure to have everyone trying to get next to you!</li>

SHAME on the HOUSE of VERSACE!!!  This perfume is gorgeous, but it needs to be recalled and re-designed!</li>
    <li> I was surprised because it didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Smell like the Vanitas I had purchased from Macy&#x27;s a year prior! I don&#x27;t believe this is the real stuff! Very disappointed.</li>
