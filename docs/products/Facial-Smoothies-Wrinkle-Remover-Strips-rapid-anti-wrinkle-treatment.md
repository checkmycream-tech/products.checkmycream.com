<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There just as expected, work good on wrinkles and lines</li>
    <li> Not sure yet, gave to my sister!</li>
    <li> re-usable, slim and not as hot to wear like the silicone</li>
    <li> I sleep on my side and stomach, and was getting nasty lines from having my face smashed into the pillow. It was a continuous line running from my forehead above the eyebrow, along the side of my nose and on my upper lip. These lines were along both sides. I use them every night, and Smoothies proved to be the perfect material to interrupt the process. I also like that they are nearly invisible. They have even gotten rid of another upper lip line that I have had for many years, probably also from sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to be giving my daughter Smoothies in her Christmas stocking, to get a jump on sleep lines. Since I cannot train myself to become a back-sleeper, I am very happy to have found Smoothies.</li>
    <li> I can say I like Dermagen Full Coverage patches better than this brand &#x27;Facial Smoothies Wrinkle Remover Strips&#x27;.  With the Dermagen patches, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the combination of the gel being used with the full forehead patch (my favorite - dips down between your eyes), but it does smooth the wrinkles when worn overnight.  Mind you - ALL these patches are a temporary mechanical fix - so by the end of the day, your wrinkles are making their appearance again.  But you feel and look better for awhile.  I think they help.&lt;br /&gt;As for &#x27;Facial Smoothies&#x27; - these really seem little more than glorified scotch tape.  There&#x27;s just no substance to them. The caption on their box says - &#x27;start when you&#x27;re 30 and you&#x27;ll never look 40&#x27;.. so if you&#x27;re already 40, they&#x27;re telling us not to bother - and as for me, I won&#x27;t - ever again!</li>
    <li> I love using these stickers at night. I&#x27;ve been using them for several weeks now, and though I don&#x27;t see much of a change over time in my forehead/glabella wrinkles, I love the way my skin looks for about 1 hour after wearing these. The stickers are very easy to apply: simply peel and stick on skin that is being held taught with your fingers. I have horizontal forehead wrinkles and 3 vertical glabella wrinkles, all of them being in the range of &amp;#34;medium-deep.&amp;#34; I go to sleep with the stickers on--they are extremely comfortable and I don&#x27;t notice wearing them at all--and when I wake up, I peel them off before heading for the shower. So, for about the first hour after peeling them off, my skin looks very good and smooth. However, the moment I begin to interact with people throughout the day and use my facial musculature, the wrinkles promptly return. I do feel that over long term, these strips will be beneficial, as at least at night I will not be actively producing wrinkles while sleeping/dreaming--anything is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;My plan, however, will be to continue using them, particularly after Botox begins to wear off. I have been getting Botox about once a year for about 5 years now, and have noticed that while the injection almost completely removes my wrinkles, they begin to return when the toxin wears off over several months. The worst of the wrinkles come back when my face &amp;#34;re-learns&amp;#34; to use the previously paralyzed muscles of facial expression. I think this is the when these strips will be most beneficial: in prolonging the effect of Botox by what I hope will be at least a month. What I noticed with these strips is a sensation in my forehead/glabella that was similar to the sensation I experienced with Botox--kind of &amp;#34;un-learning&amp;#34; the use of these muscles, at least for a little while. So, hopefully in combination with a more effective treatment, I will be able to see more sustained results.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend thesestickers not only for people with fine lines who want a little improvement, but for those who do get injectables and would want more sustained improvement of these interventions (or at least I would hope, in theory, it would work this way--since there are no actual studies that I am aware of to show this kind of product being used in conjunction with botulinum toxin treatments).</li>
    <li> A great product that works!!! I&#x27;m 61 years old with a very expressive face.  In fact, my grandmother bought me the paper Frownies when I was 13 years old!!!! She knew my face!  Needless to say after lots of expensive creams that promised to work on DEEP wrinkles, several sets of the paper frownies which do leave a triangle on my forehead, and another brand that looks just like these Smoothies ( they didn&#x27;t stay on and just wrinkled with my wrinkles)...I can see a difference after 2 weeks!  I even went to 2 Dr&#x27;s for Botox.  Each tried 2 times to make the Botox work and I&#x27;m a hopeless case they said!  (one gave me a refund and the other did not).  My aesthetician can tell the difference, the lines aren&#x27;t as deep.  Proof because she looks through a magnifying glass!  I now have hope, will probably always use them because I&#x27;m even expressive when I sleep (so my husband says)!</li>
    <li> I think this product is fantastic.  I love that it is lightweight enough to have on while sleeping. Other products are stiff and uncomfortable to have on your face all night.  This product has amazing results too. People spend a ton of money on creams and lotions that don&#x27;t deliver even a fraction of the results that this product delivers.  With this product you&#x27;ll see amazing results after just the first use.</li>
    <li> These work well and are not uncomfortable but will sometimes leave a sticky residue that is difficult to remove without irritating the skin.</li>
    <li> These work really well! Helps the muscles to relax the deep lines between my eyes is so much better. I like these much better than another brand that I tried, you can sleep with these on all night with no problems.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for a few days and LOVE it. I put them on after my shower and make sure my skin is dry. I apply the strips on some of the deeper &amp;#34;groove&amp;#34; lines (not wrinkles -haha) and leave on for 30 minutes while I have my breakfast. I take them off and then apply my Nourisse cream and VOILA my skin is instantly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do not leave behind a residue and are the right size for every part of your face. I use on the corners of my eyes, my chin area and between the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely impressed with the results and highly recommend anyone to use it, even men. Simple, fast and effective.</li>
    <li> Worthless.  I can&#x27;t even remove the stickers from the paper backing.  Are they old????</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, easy to use but I see no difference yet.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> This product is by far better than other products I have tried. I&#x27;m  very pleased with this product.  Carmenza wagner.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It works as well as Wrinkies &amp; Frownies and even better on the forehead. I have been using Wrinkies &amp; Frownies for 30 yrs and they work. I just discovered Facial Smoothies and I think they are much more comfortable and easier to use. They also stay on better.</li>
    <li> These work really well!  Except i can&#x27;t place them back on the sheets afterwards for re-using without squinting and ruining the effect. Somebody shoot me. lol</li>
    <li> These Worked Well for Me.&lt;br /&gt;Reduced my lines, worked well, definitely more effective at removing wrinkles than &#x27;anti-wrinkle&#x27; creams. I liked these better than the others I&#x27;ve used. Reusable unless you have moisturizer on when you use them, so they&#x27;re a good deal - lots of strips in the package so they&#x27;re economical.</li>
    <li> Just ordered my third box!  I wear at night, when I&#x27;m sleeping, to smooth out lines along my chin and between my eyebrows.  I have very fair, sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no irritation from the product.  It&#x27;s amazing how smooth my face is in the morning!  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me !!</li>
    <li> Facial Smoothies Strips have worked very well for me, in addressing the &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; between my eyebrows.  I had previously relied on Botox injections for them but was never satisfied with the results.  I use the Smoothies every night, and my &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; are almost invisible now, with no expensive Botox. They work best if you use them nightly;  they are re-usable, and I use each set up to 3 or 4 times. There are a variety of shapes and sizes and I usually combine several in different forehead areas. These are much superior to any of the other wrinkle strips I&#x27;ve tried; I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to avoid the cost and pain of Botox injections.</li>
    <li> I am officially hooked on facial smoothies - I am 55 and just started facial treatments in the last 6 months - botox between brows, above and at crows. 1st Chem peel and laser treatment on rosacea - LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 111 between my brows was so deep that the botox has them under control but the wrinkles are so set that the doc warned me it would take at least a year for them to fully recede &amp; I seem to be frowning in my sleep even since botox because I wake up with a noticeable line that is not apparent during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the smoothies primarily between the brows and on forehead. Trimming to size and lifting the edges slightly as recommended helps keep skin smooth too. A terrific supplement for my much more expensive derma treatments. Yes, temporary - as is hair color, teeth bleaching and most every skin treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start early &amp; use often! I am a nightly user now and just ordered more. The triangles are my go-to but I will adapt others for my target areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal, fast delivery - highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I keep ordering these so they must be working. I especially like them in the middle of the forehead and over the lips.</li>
    <li> I just ordered 3 more boxes. These are easy and effective. My 60yr old skin is showing some wrinkles, especially around my mouth. Sleeping on my side just deepens them. But wearing Facial Smoothies allows the wrinkles to &amp;#34;iron out&amp;#34; overnight. Night after night use and the wrinkles eventually smooth out. Using serum and face cream under make up daily speeds up the reversal process.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with Facial Smoothies!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have a very deep wrinkle between my brows and after one night of using Facial Smoothies, it was flat and significantly faded. After one week of applying a Smoothie strip each evening, it was fully flat and stayed that way during the day.  Makeup no longer collected in the groove, because there was no groove. I am impressed. This is definitely better than Botox.  A great value, easy to use and----it works!  My makeup looks great!</li>
    <li> I have used these for 2 nights and can tell a difference.  I know that this is something that I have to continue but its worth it.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference this has made already.  Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I have use them in the past,They are what I expected they stay on and are easy to take off they can be used over if desired.one Happy customer Carmen Delaisla</li>
    <li> Frownies work much better, but neither brand lasts very long..</li>
    <li> I wanted to write this review while my experience was still fresh in my mind. I used this product for the first time last night. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I decided to take the plunge and use one on my forehead overnight. The product was extremely easy to apply, was very comfortable, and didn&#x27;t budge all night. (I didn&#x27;t apply it over moisturizer - just on clean, dry, bare skin.) The product works on the premise that you pull your wrinkles apart with your fingers on one hand, while applying the strips with the other, so I even used a second smaller one to pull up my left eyebrow a little bit, as it has fallen a bit more than my right from years of sleeping on that side. The strips stayed in place with my wrinkles pulled apart underneath. In the morning, when I removed the strips and looked in the mirror I was shocked - about 95% of the wrinkles on my forehead were gone and my left eyebrow was even with my right one! All I could think was &amp;#34;Wow, this is what my forehead would look like if I did Botox or had plastic surgery.&amp;#34; I was thrilled; it was a dramatic difference. Then I went to wash my face and raised my eyebrows to wash my eyelids - causing my forehead to contract and poof - about 65% of my forehead wrinkles came right back. So, I guess it works if you don&#x27;t make any facial expressions. The question now is, will this have any benefits over time? Skin isn&#x27;t a muscle, so it doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;muscle memory&amp;#34; or my answer would be yes. However, one would think skin could possibly be trained, just like how my left eyebrow became droopy after years of my sleeping on that side and my wrinkles are more prominent on that side. However, this occurred on my face over decades (I just turned 50), and one with think it would take years of using this product to stretch out and undo the wrinkles. An optimist would think it could help diminish the wrinkles over time. I&#x27;m going to keep using them for awhile, and at least enjoy the temporary benefits. I&#x27;ll see if after time if it has any permanent benefits. My forehead wrinkles are so deep, any reduction would be considered a success. I will try to report back and post another review after long time use of this product, that is, if I determine it&#x27;s worth pursuing.</li>
    <li> A good temporary face lift.  Wear while you sleep and your lines are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> They really help to keep my forehead from stressing especially while sleeping. Plus they are quite reusable. Love them!!! Will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> These are horrible. They don&#x27;t stick well and slide around easily.  I prefer to use Frownies instead.</li>
    <li> I like how they make your lines disappear...I have bags and wrinkles under my eyes...from my face swelling multiple times before discovering it was my thyroid....anyway damage was done and these seem to help retrain them not to crease when I wear them throughout the night.</li>
    <li> Seems ok but haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
    <li> Facial Smoothies are exactly what I was looking for.  As other reviewers have noted, nothing will permanently remove wrinkles, however,  this product does significantly reduce the appearance of them!  I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> They definitely smooth the wrinkles, but the effect lasts only a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot in the package! 120 so if you are treating just one area, like smile lines, the package will last a long time. Not only that, I have used the card that they come on, to store them to be used a second time. And, the larger strips can be cut into smaller pieces, so it&#x27;s even more economical. They peal off easily and are clear enough that if I wanted to go to the mailbox outside, or drive to work, I would feel comfortable knowing that it wouldn&#x27;t look odd. The other thing I was worried about is if the adhesive would irritate my sensitive skin. So far, no problems. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Basically, I like these very much. They smooth out frown lines, are almost invisible and adhere well. The only downside is that they leave a sticky residue that can only be removed by applying and pulling off masking tape on the area after cleansing. (&amp;#34;Scotch&amp;#34; tape doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.) It took me a while to figure out how to remove the stickiness, but it&#x27;s worth the extra effort as it shows up as dark areas under makeup. I will continue to use them until something better comes along. No Botox for me.</li>
    <li> Thanks to this product, I am in my mid-50s with no frown lines at all between my eyes... as long as I regularly use these strips.  For me, the most vulnerable time for frown lines to form is when I am focused and concentrating, especially when I am on the computer.  Therefore, I wear these when I am going to sit at the computer for an extended time.  If I were to stop using the product for a full day, faint lines would begin to show, but - at this stage, they will entirely disappear when I go back to using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the between-eye area, I use the wider half of one of the pre-formed triangles (or cut a trapezoid shape) and apply with the wider part on top.  When applied well, these strips are barely noticeable. They have a clear, matte (non-shiny) surface, which is perfect. When wearing them, the slight sensation I get from frowning has made me more aware of what I am doing, so it trains me not to frown as much.  I can wear them over make-up as long as I dab the area with a tissue first. The strips are very comfortable on my skin. (When taking them off, it is best to peel them off slowly and at a side angle, rather than pulling directly up (or outward) on your skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have been a success for me in preventing frown lines, so I am grateful to have found them. They are much more natural looking than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> So far I like them, I dont see them being reusable though. I will re-review once ive used them for a longer period. Update: after using them for a few nights I really like them! Definitely see immediate results after one use. I feel the shapes and sizes could be different thought. The &amp;#34;full forehead&amp;#34; strip is way too small to cover all lines yet too big to smoothly stick to your fave. I usually end up cutting it into smaller lines to cover my forehead wrinkles. Most of the shapes are either too big or too small but you can easily cut them into shapes you want. The quantities of each shape is bizarre as well. One long line strip? I dont know anyone that has a single long line on their forehead. I end up using about half a sheet per night and if you plan to use these overnight they are definitely not reusable. My supply will be done in 2 weeks at this rate. Update: two days after wearing line strips on my forehead I wiped my skin with a mild glycolic toner. (I always use this and never have problems) my skin where the tape was placed is swelling up and burns. Is this some sort of allergic reaction what the heck is happening here? Ouch! Strips have not been on my skin for two days. This is not freshly removed redness.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet so I can&#x27;t see any change.</li>
    <li> Obviously they are a temporary thing, wrinkles are not going anywhere unless medically taken care of; but these really do work and you really can tell the difference after taking them off.  I sleep in them and remove them in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have used thus product  for over a year now after switching from another  brand. This is the best anti wrinkle treatment  i have used... love it..</li>
    <li> A big waste of money!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Thin and really diminishes the lines in the morning.and the strips can be re-used2-3 times</li>
    <li> These are very comfortable and work well. I wear them at night and in the morning I have wrinkle free skin... for about an hour. It does feel like it lasts a little longer everyday though and now, after two weeks of using it, my face has a noticeable feeling of relaxed skin(I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it) and I feel that it is really training my muscles to stay relax and not wrinkle up my skin during the day. I&#x27;ve also found that they can be used much more than two times. I&#x27;ve got a weeks use out of each sheet so far. I basically use them till the glue starts coming off but they still work. One note for those of you who can&#x27;t afford these, I get the same result using medical tape but the tape is not as comfortable, can&#x27;t be reused as many times, and can be painful to remove. So there is another option but I really think these are worth the extra cost in the long run.</li>
    <li> I want to say thanks for fantastic customer service, I ordered Wrinkle Remover Strips on Friday and got shipping on Sunday!!!  I think they do a gob and I am looking forward to have even greater results in future. I got the idea to iron tiny little wrinkles using a medicine tape in problematic areas of my face. It worked out well but the process of applying was long and too much complicated. The new strips are very cute, easy to apply,  size is  right and package is nice. Looking forward to look younger without facelift and feel very optimistic.</li>
    <li> Totally temporary but they do work.  So if you have a special occasion I would give them a try.  I have not able to reuse them.</li>
    <li> these are great.  Will order again.Use them for an hour or so before you go out at night and your face is so smooth</li>
    <li> These adhesive strips really do what they promise. I use them for the vertical lines between my brows, and I was really pleasantly surprised the first time I used them -- taking them off, those lines were amazingly reduced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear them all night while I sleep, after moisturising. This means that I can only use the strips once, but I think it&#x27;s the optimal way to use them, for my face. The results are certainly well worth the (small amount) of time it takes (to wait a bit for my evening moisturising to soak in, and then apply the triangle-shaped strip) and also certainly worth the (reasonable) expense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is pretty sensitive, and I&#x27;ve had rosacea in the past. But I&#x27;ve never had the least problem with these strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them very highly. And the company who makes them is very friendly and responsive (and has sent me so much information!), which just makes a good thing better! If you don&#x27;t want to go the Botox route, and moisturising alone isn&#x27;t solving your wrinkle issues, this is your best bet for fighting the good fight against lines!</li>
    <li> Use the facial smoothies at night on marionette lines and forehead lines. Lines are less severe when I first get up and in general the smoothies seem to have slowed down deepening of those same lines.</li>
    <li> I use these in conjunction with the nuface facial toner.  I don&#x27;t think they would work as well just on their own. Perhaps they would have worked better if I started younger.  I was doing it when I was younger in my thirties but my husband complained about me going to bed with things on my face.  Now he is more concerned with me being unhappy with my appearance.  When you first take them off your face looks like it did when you were young.  They have softened the lines but they don&#x27;t take them away completely.  I will keep using them because I don&#x27;t have any alternative except for botox and I won&#x27;t put that in my body.</li>
    <li> Rips off your skin when removing and pulls (not supposed to pull or tug at delicate face skin or it causes irreversable wrinkles without cutting them out that is) PLUS I slept in them and they left dents everywhere. ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good concept but no cigar for me.  Threw them out.</li>
    <li> very poor in quality will be reordering it!!</li>
    <li> Smoothies remove wrinkles better than the wrinkle creams.  Follow the directions though. I found it helps to put a little moisturizer on first so they are easier to get off later. This might reduce the staying power - but mine still stayed on fine. I think this anti-wrinkle treatment is a good deal because there are so many strips in the box and they last a long time.</li>
    <li> These smoothies do not work for lip lines. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I really like using facial smoothies. I am a side sleeper and I wear them overnight to stop those nasty pillow face wrinkles. They also smooth out the wrinkles under my eyes. I look refreshed in the am. If the effects would last I would give 5 stars and be in heaven! But then I guess all the plastic surgeons would be out of business. But I do love the way they temporarily smooth out even the most stubborn wrinkles. Also I find they are reusable once or twice. I will keep reordering them, thank you for a good product.</li>
    <li> First time I tried this product.  To be honest I know vitamin c is great for your skin.  Did I see great results, not really, but continued to use it for,the natural vitamin c benefits.  I don&#x27;t think I will reorder at this time</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my results using Facial Smoothies. I do not yet have many visible wrinkles but I have started to see some lines that prompted me to look for an anti-aging prevention treatment. I am not ready to invest in expensive products or serious procedures and this product was recommended to me. I tried these for the first time for 30 mins after my evening facial cleansing in case my delicate skin reacted. After leaving them on I had zero skin irritation and the lines were nearly gone. I wore again over night a few days later and saw more dramatic results in the morning. After applying my day makeup, lines were invisible. I will definitely continue to use Facial Smoothies as an affordable and effective anti-aging treatment.</li>
    <li> These are terrible!  They do not work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see results for long after taking them off.</li>
    <li> These are just an overpriced tape. Half of them are useless because they are too small which means not such a great deal. I should have paid attention to the pictures instead of reviews (most of 5 star reviews are questionable. I have seen other PR campaigns like this on Amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;If you are a side sleeper, they will dig into your skin and create another line on your face because they are very narrow, which will cause irritation. I do not like Frownies but at least they are generously sized, you can reshape them. I had to cut forehead patch to use on nasolabial lines (they want you to use pea size patches on these...good luck with that!). I can also use triangular patch between brows, but it doesn&#x27;t work as good as frownies or just a tape. I would not recommend reusing them, though they will stick second time around (not as good as the first time), but sweat, oil accumulate on the patch overnight - these are not breathable - they look nasty after the first use. You don&#x27;t want it back on your face. These patches were more irritating than the regular tape (scotch satin), I can not use them. I have red lines on the sides of my mouth for several days now, and a couple of pimples, they accentuate wrinkles even more. In general patches do work - mostly to prevent wrinkles, not to completely get rid of them - so please take comments like this with a grain of salt &amp;#34;I am amazed that my frown lines didn&#x27;t start reappearing until 2 weeks after using these&amp;#34; (looks like this review was promptly edited). I did find the product that I like. I tried Dermagen patches and repurchased them many times since then, love them!! edit. It looks like the seller redesigned the product and came up with different shapes. It&#x27;s a good thing that she took constructive criticism seriously.d a product that I like. I am going to try dermagen patches next (edit: I tried crescent shapes, love them and have ordered more shapes).</li>
    <li> I did not see a notable difference.</li>
    <li> Very good supplier.  Fast Shipment.  Received as advertised.  The Smoothies seemed to help with deep crows feet, at least temporarily.</li>
    <li> So easy to use, and holy moly do they work amazingly!!!! And they can be re-used once or twice!!!!</li>
    <li> I  gave Smoothies a try because it sounded like an interesting product and I thought the price was reasonable. The Smoothies went on easily and removed with ease as well. I kept the product on about 4 hours and then had to go out. I honestly didn&#x27;t see much of a difference when I took them off. This could be because I am almost in my mid sixties and have had wrinkles on a certain spot on my face for years. In fact a dermatologist told me the only way to remove them would be with a series of costly laser skin treatments. I think this product would  probably work better on very fine lines on perhaps someone younger.</li>
    <li> Is very efficient for 18 to 20 years old (without wrinkles), not for mature women.</li>
    <li> I have used these for a week now and honestly I have to say I love this product! I noticed a difference after the first night but after a week there is a significant difference in the wrinkles on my face and neck! I have been able to reuse the first ones for over a week now and they stay on all night with no problem, I am a side sleeper and they stay put until I take them off.  I have very sensitive skin and these have not irritated it all! This is a wonderful product, I will buy again! Another big bonus is I received the smoothies within days.</li>
    <li> Effective and easy to use.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not do what was described, I saw no change.  Results were poor</li>
    <li> I used Smoothies for about a week and loved them until I started getting pimples everywhere I put them. Frownies breathe so this doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> It might sound like a good thing, and it definitely is when they&#x27;re on, but these strips are clear and very hard to see on the sheet.  I need a bright light and my glasses to find the edges.&lt;br /&gt;I do like pretty much everything else about them, though.  My skin looks smoother - not only because my lines are gone, but I think the exfoliation has also helped its texture.  Even though I have sensitive skin and sometimes still get breakouts, it&#x27;s never where I put the Facial Smoothies.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that these are reusable.  First time buyer and will buy again!</li>
    <li> I was thinking that it is time to start getting botox and juvenderm, etc injections,  but not with this product! This product allows me to put off those expensive injections, at least for now. It really plumps up my skin. It got rid of my frown lines and improved the texture of my face for a special event.  I was amazed that my frown lines didn&#x27;t start reappearing until 2 weeks after using these. These will last me quite a while, because there are more than 100 in the package. I notice a little wrinkle on my face and put one of these smoothies on for a couple of hours and the wrinkle is gone for a week+. WOW! Great product! Love, love, love these smoothies!</li>
    <li> I have the # lines on my brow and these have helped immensely! It takes a wee bit of practice to find which patch and placement works, but they do.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try these after reading all the positive reviews.  I took note of those saying they were only &#x27;temporary&#x27; wrinkle removers, some eluded to the fact that with continued use their wrinkles were removed permanently.  After using these for a week, when I take the strip off, yes the wrinkles are gone (and it&#x27;s heaven on earth) for about 5 minutes then it&#x27;s back to business as usual.  Not sure what the point is in these.</li>
    <li> Simple and so effective.  I&#x27;ve used the other well-known brand in the past, with good results; however, the edges of the paper strips never seemed to adhere completely to my skin.  Smoothies go on smoothly, including the edges (more comfortable!), and the different shapes provided make wrinkle coverage so much easier than the other brand.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have had the Facial Smoothies for several months now, but I wanted to wait to see results before I wrote a review.&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using them I have noticed smoother skin and less fine lines. The difference in my forehead lines are probably the most dramatic. I have never seen results comparable with any cream or serum. They are so easy to use and you don&#x27;t have to wear them for that long to see results! Because of my busy schedule, I only have time to wear them for 20 or so minutes a day. They really are an anti-aging secret. I only wish I had started using them in my 20&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Work well. I would recommend !</li>
    <li> They stuck to my skin so much that it was terribly painful to pull them off.  Rodan &amp; Fields (the Dermatologists who created Proactiv) developed a similar product that has a couple of more steps in the process, but it works wonders and is well worth the money.  I think they are only available through individual distributors/representatives, but you might try direct online.  They are the next best thing to getting fillers done at the Doctor&#x27;s office, but we less than the cost.</li>
    <li> these are terrible. I&#x27;ve tried the original by frownies and even though I knew these were a knock off I didn&#x27;t think they would be as bad as they turned out to be. knock offs should knock it off. you&#x27;d have better success sticking duck tape to your wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Falls off the chart; does not meet expectations at all, not even slightly.</li>
    <li> ...I&#x27;ll be back for more.  You have to experiment with the different shapes, can&#x27;t just go by the guide booklet.  CAUTION:  these WILL CAUSE wrinkles in areas where you did not previously have wrinkles if you&#x27;re not EXTREMELY careful where &amp; how to place them.  Work well for &amp;#34;number 11&amp;#34; and forehead wrinkles...of course the effect doesn&#x27;t last forever, only temporary.</li>
    <li> These items are great and really work. Make sure to pull apart your wrinkles before placing them on your forehead unless you want to set your wrinkles. My only complaint is that I wish the forehead strip was bigger.</li>
    <li> Whatever unique ingredients comprise the inner layer that is adhered to the skin, when it is removed, the skin takes on an extremely smooth texture, and is a perfect base on which to apply your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be wonderful if this line also offered full forehead sizes, or entire masks of this material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased, will continue purchasing.</li>
    <li> I searched several products to help with wrinkles and this had several positive reviews. However I did not have any luck with them&lt;br /&gt;and was rather disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use these every night, and they really help smooth out the wrinkles on my forehead, between my eyes and around my mouth. I love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Frownies for years and they do help but after missing just a few days or sometimes by the afternoon, my furrows would return. With this product, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s forcing my face muscles to freeze but it seems to do a better job on a day-to-day basis of smoothing my current wrinkles without creating side wrinkles caused by the firmness of the Frownies.</li>
    <li> awesome product will purchase. seemed to peel the lines around my mouth away.</li>
    <li> The order arrived very promptly and I&#x27;m glad it did as I enjoy using this wonderful product.  I  feel that I can now sleep in piece without worrying about crunching up my face all night as I am a side sleeper.  I use them under my eyes, on my forehead, and around my mouth. I  have noticed that in the morning the bags under my eyes are not as puffy and my forehead wrinkles have smoothed out somewhat.  My eyebrows have even lifted a bit.  I know the wrinkles may not completely disappear but they are quite diminished and I am pleased with the results. I wear the smoothies when I get home in the evening after work and much of the day on Saturday and Sunday.  They feel comfortable on my face and remind me not to frown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely re-order this product.  I feel with continued use things will only get better and for that I am glad.</li>
    <li> Does not work, read the instructions like it said did everything right didn&#x27;t even see a small results wont buy it again</li>
    <li> IMPRESSIVE RESULTS...I&#x27;m 55. My eyes expressions looked less exhausted, Crows-feet &amp; Forehead became smooth. I wanted a change and finally I have the face I deserve. I put my face to the test after using the Smoothies Strips for 3 days, my friends comments were impressive of the results. This product is a 10 STARS , over my expectation. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast-next day!!! I&#x27;m 29 with some forehead wrinkles and near the mouth. I expected different results. If you wear them overnight, you can&#x27;t put any cream on your face.  So you need to figure out a different time to use them. Also, they have very strong glue which stays on your face and you need to rub it off...it hurts especially near the eye area. I&#x27;m not sure how other people see the effect, it works just for few hours until your skin will get back to what it was. I&#x27;ll continue to use it, since I bought it. I will not buy another box.</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;m a guy, I&#x27;ve been really worried about my crows feet that seemed to be getting worse and worse. I spend a lot of time outdoors for work and playing golf. I don&#x27;t really like to wear heavy creams or anything, but these are comfortable enough to wear over night and when I wake up I can&#x27;t believe how smoothed out my wrinkles are.</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use them correctly, or my wrinkles are too cavernous and well educated to change, but I found this a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not very good be cheaper to put scotch tape on my face. Sorry I wanted to believe its promises. I bought it after seeing a  , what I thought , similar product on Shark Tank. The Sharks didn&#x27;t buy it and I shouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> This is working to reduce my marionette lines after just 2 nights of sleeping with them on! I look younger and smoother. I am 43 and avoiding botox as long as I can! These aren&#x27;t very noticeable. My husband hasn&#x27;t even noticed I&#x27;m wearing these to bed. :)</li>
    <li> I wear these while sleeping..I am preventing my &amp;#34;sleep&amp;#34; lines from getting any worse</li>
    <li> Love the product, it really works!  In fact, it works better than expected since it&#x27;s reusable.  I used one for 3 nights and it&#x27;s still sticking.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s the simple remedies that work the best. When I read about Smoothies it seemed too good to be true. I went to their website and read more about the research and the development that went into making Smoothies. It all made sense, but it still seemed too good to be true. But for the low price I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;. So I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package says, &amp;#34;Start when you are 30 and you&#x27;ll never look 40&amp;#34;. I groaned out loud because I passed by 30 AND 40 some time ago. I wondered if, at 53, it was too late for me. Totally NOT. Smoothies do exactly what they say they do. They flatten out the &amp;#34;crease&amp;#34; aka wrinkle and give the the skin a chance to recover its normal condition. It&#x27;s thrilling to see the wrinkles on my forehead, crow&#x27;s feet and, my biggest issue, the lines along my upper lip, disappear. Yes, they came back quickly because I&#x27;m still prone to the facial expressions that caused them in the first place. But as it says on the box, repeated application will bring cumulative results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using Smoothies for 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve already noticed a big difference in the depth and appearance of the lines on my face. I sleep with them to promote the maximum results. Also, I apply Smoothies to my upper lip when I&#x27;m sitting at my computer; both to remind me to be conscious about my facial expressions and to encourage lasting results. I am also sleeping on my back using a travel pillow to create all night comfort. I anticipate that over time I&#x27;ll need to reapply them less and less frequently to maintain results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to point out that I&#x27;ve been able to reapply my Smoothies at least 5 times before losing the adhesive. With and without moisturizer on my face! I have spent as much as $175 for ONE bottle of anti-aging serum that didn&#x27;t give me results this noticeable. $15 is a bargain!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 more packages already. One for each of my daughters as a gift. They are 28 and 32 and I&#x27;m thrilled for both of them that Smoothies appeared on the scene in time to KEEP their skin young looking and beautiful.led for both of them that Smoothies appeared on the scene in time to KEEP their skin young looking and beautiful.</li>
    <li> These strips are very comfortable to wear.  I use them at night because when I sleep it causes a lot of creases in my face.  They make a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how well these worked, will be buying more when I have used my supply up.</li>
    <li> Ordered one box and now I just ordered 2 more! You can actually see a difference in reduction of wrinkles in like 15 minutes of wearing! I wear them approx 4 overnights per week. And you can reuse them as well and they do not lose their stickiness. My biggest issue is my crows feet around my eyes and I can really see a difference after only 1 box - I&#x27;m a 5 star fan!</li>
    <li> These are great!  Stayed on all through night!  I can see how regular use of these would help soften any lines or creases on the face.</li>
    <li> Caused a red mark of where it was placed on my forehead and took a couple of days to clear.  No rash after using anywhere else on my face.  And you can reuse them.  I won&#x27;t buy again and won&#x27;t use on my forehead anymore.</li>
    <li> Yes it seems to work but is this different that plain old regular contact paper?&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have been using them for about a month and they do make the wrinkles vanish-temporarily. They are back by the end of the day.  It is pretty amazing also when you are preparing for a night out because your forehead looks super smooth. I have  also observed over time that my furrowed brow looks less furrowed which can be attributed to the  consistent nightly use.  I agree with the other reviewer who says they can also be reused for several times.</li>
    <li> These things really work.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll have to keep up with, but it is well worth the work.  The price is so minimal!</li>
    <li> Strips/patches are way too small and narrow, and some of the shapes didn&#x27;t really suit my face.The &amp;#34;adhesive&amp;#34;, or whatever it is, is pretty weak.  Even brand new, the strip wouldn&#x27;t stick after I removed it to reposition it. I always had a clean, freshly washed face, with no lotions, or anything else applied.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32, I bought a few &amp;#34;wrinkle &amp;#34; patches from different companies, all at the same time. I&#x27;m new to this so I wasn&#x27;t sure which were best. After I used these, I came back and bought four more boxes. This is the only &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; strip/patch I have rebought. Of course I will finish using the ones from the other companies, (I&#x27;m not made of money) but if I have these, (I&#x27;ve ran out)I I use these first. Like I said, I&#x27;m 32, I&#x27;m working on the forehead area so I don&#x27;t need all the other strips that come with this. However, I do use them in ways they were not intended....such as, under my eye (yes, I use these under my eyes) on a line in my neck, a snip with some scissors and I can place them where ever I wish. They come on something like a note card, and there are about 10 or 11 &amp;#34;cards&amp;#34; per box. I&#x27;m not sure, so don&#x27;t quote me on that.....I wash and dry my face, put them on and then off to bed I go! In the morning, just peel it off and put it back on the sheet, I can only use the same strip twice. A few times, I have just got out of bed, peeled them off my face, left the forehead patch on, covered it with a hat, and left it on all day!</li>
    <li> I have used them only 2-3 times, but can tell they do work. However, I have not been able to wear them past 45 minutes maximum, since I start feeling my skin underneath itching. I give the product 5 starts nevertheless, because it could be my skin is more sensitive that others, and may have nothing to do with the quality of the product. I wonder what would they do if worn a whole night?? I bet you, one could wake up looking like a teenager again, which would be lovely!! :D</li>
    <li> I have the normal wrinkles attributed to 69 years of repeated facial expressions. Silicone injections have softened the lines; however, they are &amp;#34;etched&amp;#34; on my face. Botox lasts 2 to 3 months, and over a year&#x27;s time is prohibitive for many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one week&#x27;s use, I find that this product does smooth the lines, but loses its effect after a few hours. Also,  it makes more sense for me to wear these a few hours before going out than overnight. The product is translucent,  and not unsightly. It took me a few attempts to apply the Smoothies properly, avoiding stretching the skin too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer suggested, I use Lumene Time Freeze with makeup, to prolong the fresh look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use all of the shapes, cutting the odd sizes to fit each particular area. I use each piece twice, although others have reported additional uses. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> SEE review of AHA SOUFLEE CREAM These I will NEVER LIVE W OUT I JUST GOT TONS MORE TODAY DELEIVERED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celebs have KNOWN THIS SECRET FOR DECADES AND NEVER TOLD PUBLIC, old style were FROWNIES, NEW IMPROVED BY DIFF COMPANY IS CALED SMOOTHIES AND ALONG W AHA , have SERIOSULY CHSNGED MY FACE AND WRINKLES AND TONE ALREADY w NO SIDE AFECTS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST REAL EFFECTS !</li>
    <li> I am 44 and have been using Smoothies between my eyebrows (for my ONE) nightly since about November. I used to have a deep wrinkle about 3/4 of an inch long and fairly deep. As of the beginning of April it&#x27;s maybe 1/8 of an inch long and very shallow by midday and completely gone most of the morning. It has helped tremendously{ if you actually want to take a few months}. I wear during the day sometimes too and I think that helps me not make my &amp;#34;squinty&amp;#34; face. I do not think they are actually reusable unless you have a super dry face. But they are very transparent and you can get away with leaving one on while out doing errands. Also if you want to try them out without spending the money, the Nexcare transparent tape works well--you just have to cut the shapes out.</li>
    <li> Works great but must use every night</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well these strips work. I get Restylane fillers every few months. This product really helps in between my treatments. Look, I was super skeptical. Us women try everything and anything to help smooth facial lines. Most products do not work. I reordered already. Good product.</li>
    <li> I tried these strips every night for about a month, and I saw absolutely no improvement.  In fact the strips made more indentations than the wrinkles I was trying to eliminate.  The instructions do address this problem by saying to reposition the strip to try to erase the indentation caused by the strip, but that didn&#x27;t help either.  My sister also tried them and had just as bad experience with them.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other brands of this type (Frownies for example) and these seem to work the best!! First, because they are comfortable. With Frownies which are made of paper, you can often feel them on your face which makes them uncomfortable to sleep with.  Smoothies are of a material that while holding your &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; and lines in place, move a bit with your face so you don&#x27;t feel them.  Plus, you really can&#x27;t see them so if you are not alone, you don&#x27;t look so ridiculous! I often cut some of the pieces to cover specific lines.  You do need to place them carefully or you can end up with a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; line next to the smoothie but when placed correctly, I have almost completely erased the frown lines between my eyebrows!! Love them!</li>
    <li> Very temporary results.... like 5 minutes tops! You can use packing tape with the same results. Waste of money like most rejuvenating products I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
    <li> I decided to try these out of curiosity-- my first anti-wrinkle patches. They&#x27;re pretty comfortable to wear overnight, and I notice a modest difference after using them. I&#x27;m still deciding whether or not to buy them again. They&#x27;re very economical -- a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I read that some other reviewers wear these in public. I would feel like a total Norma Desmond (Google the movie Sunset Boulevard if you don&#x27;t know who that is). An ageing lady with tape on her face - embarrassing! Vanity by night, alright Mr. DeMille, then... by day... \\&quot;I&#x27;m ready for my close-up!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Facial Smoothies are so easy to use and they really work! I like that they are all natural and you will see results whether you wear them 20 minutes or all night. Great product and nice for girlfriend gifts too!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work at all.  Stupid, stupid, stupid me.  You put them on, they don&#x27;t stick.  They don&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product has virtually removed the frown line dent between my eyes!!  I had no idea this product invention even existed until a girlfriend handed these out at one of her home &amp;#34;spa parties.&amp;#34;  Actually, it was a different brand and a little &amp;#34;gooier&amp;#34; residue left, but the same purpose in pulling out wrinkles.  Another woman there who swore by these non-botox products said she was a devout user of this particular brand (Smoothies) because it was known for having (by far) the strongest adhesive for the best results, and you get over 100 pieces.  Hands down correct! No comparison in the adhesive strength, the &amp;#34;dent removal outcome&amp;#34; and zero residue at all.  The other thing too, although maybe not all that important to some people, the packaging  with Smoothies presents as &amp;#34;professionally hygienic&amp;#34; almost like you&#x27;re opening a sterile and safe product to put on your skin.  I think the other ones from the party came in a bag which is probably why I was hesitant to even try these.  SO glad I did!  Rather, SO SO glad I was told about this brand!</li>
    <li> I am new to this product. But have used in my past 2 very popular previous brands. I will stick to Facial Smoothies because of the fast results. At night time I sleep with the well lubricated adhesive strips. I use them for laugh &amp; smile lines. They stay in place better and the next morning I see better results then the past 5 years I have used the other products. Also there is so much more in the box. You can re use them, but I like to use fresh ones. The price is worth the quality of better results. I will re order soon. Also I amusing this brand more frequently. Thank you so much V&#x27;Nette</li>
    <li> These are the only thing I&#x27;ve found that are comfortable to sleep in. They do work in keeping your skin flat while you&#x27;re sleeping so as not to increase wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t recommend reusing the same sticker but rather change them nightly. I would love it if they would come out with a box of all one type of sticker. I use just the frown line sticker and end up cutting the others into shape. Great product though.</li>
    <li> See a difference very quickly.  Lines around lip line faded. Sometimes difficult to peel off but worth the trouble in the long run.</li>
    <li> This really works! You will see immediate results in the first use. Lines will appear diminished considerably. It removes dry flaky skin and picks up some dirt from pores as well... bonus! I will leave comments later after using for a whole month. Super quick shipping as well!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  The strips can be used over and over again - they still stick and do not leave any adhesive residue behind.</li>
    <li> I put these on my forehead before going to bed, and when I take them off the next morning, my forehead is super smooth.  I am in my late 40&#x27;s and have some deep-ish forehead wrinkles, so for those to be pretty much gone, that&#x27;s gotta be saying something! However, throughout the day, my normal facial movements will recreate those forehead wrinkles since I&#x27;m pretty expressive, and I&#x27;m back where I started by the end of the day.  So, I figure if a person can afford to get botox to prevent the facial movements that cause those wrinkles, then the affects of these strips would last longer throughout the day.  I think the magic formula might be botox, these strips, and a really good moisturizer or serum, and one could possibly take their skin back to where it was 10-15 years ago!</li>
    <li> I love these Smoothies! These are SO much better than anything else out there. First, they are more comfortable to use. They also couldn&#x27;t be easier to apply AND remove. Follow the instructions and you&#x27;ll find it so easy to make your lines less noticeable. It is very satisfying to take off those strips and see smooth skin underneath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other wrinkle patches in the past and these are MUCH better looking (you can hardly see them on your skin). You hardly feel them, too. Completely comfortable. They&#x27;re definitely more effective than the other types as well. Besides, the edges of the paper ones always came off (and were really annoying to remove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reapply the strips a few times a week and you&#x27;ll be good to go. No hassle and pretty reasonable price. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Did not notice any changes at all.  Need a product like that, where we could apply makeup over them and it would look like a face lift.</li>
    <li> in the morning, your face is one whole shade off. it deesn&#x27;t hold well either. I like that its clear, but it doesn&#x27;t do the job :(</li>
    <li> Facial smoothies are the ideal anti wrinkle treatment. My skin looks so much smoother, I am amazed. I have fewer lines and they definitely work better than any of the other serums or lotions I have tried (and to be fair I won&#x27;t list them)! They are especially great to remove lines before I apply makeup so my foundation doesn&#x27;t get caught in any unsightly crevices on my complexion. I can really see the results in photos too! I look younger and my skin smoother. I also love to use them before an event and they are so cost effective. I don&#x27;t usually post reviews but, I am determined to share this skin gem i have found!</li>
    <li> Total Rubbish!  They were hard to put on and I felt that you most certainly cannot reuse them the next day as they had lost a lot of their stickiness.  The benefits of using them were 0.  A big, big waste of money.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! PLASTIC SURGERY ON A STICKY STRIP!!!&lt;br /&gt;As a model and an RN, I have to say...&amp;#34;BRAVO&amp;#34;...finally a product that does what it says it does. I have tried other products but they come no where near close so don&#x27;t waste your money buying other &#x27;versions&#x27;. Facial Smoothies are the ONLY brand I use and recommend. You will notice a difference after just one use. Not only do these facial smoothies smooth out and in my case totally eliminate wrinkles but my skin which was already in good condition, is in even better condition...it is flawless and even toned. Like all things, you have to keep this up and let&#x27;s be reasonable here, if you need major plastic surgery then only the skilled hands of a surgeon can remedy any &amp;#34;Major&amp;#34; cosmetic issues. However, if you want to lessen or even rid yourself of wrinkles, achieve beautifully soft skin and I also need to add that my enlarged pores disappeared too, then Facial Smoothies are for you. They are a must for me and my beauty regime. I personally think of these strips as plastic surgery on a sticky strip and you can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;I have had cosmetic laser procedures performed on my skin and I feel that Facial Smoothies even surpass professional cosmetic treatments. I also have amazingly sensitive skin and I have had no problems with irritation at all with Facial Smoothies but other brands and knockoffs have irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;These Facial Smoothies are not only the most effective of all the brands I have tried but they are the most cost effective. Some other brands similar to Facial Smoothies but are &amp;#34;NOT&amp;#34; facial smoothies cost up to 30.7 cents a strip and you WON&#x27;T achieve the same results. Facial Smoothies cost about 13.3 cents a strip and they WORK. You will LOVE Facial Smoothies and you will achieve amazing results but be ready for people to comment on your glowing, smooth, wrinkle free and pore free skin.I have also bought &#x27;Nourisse&#x27; cream from the same company and it is fabulous!!!!I actually even got asked the other day if I had just had any professional work done on my face..LOL.....Facial Smoothies are the best beauty product out there today. I also stopped using botox. So ladies and gentlemen too, treat yourself to a product that finally works. Don&#x27;t waste your money on any other products when Facial Smoothies is exactly what you have been looking for. ( I am not a doctor and do not claim to be one. I am married to one though and he is amazed by my results by using Facial Smoothies and Nourisse)</li>
    <li> I like these a lot - they DO work.  I sleep with them on most nights (all night) and  I initially apply them - yes - just a few minutes after my nightly moisturizer. (I would never ever sleep without moisturizer.)  It may take a while to figure out how much to pull the facial skin around to flatten the area you want to treat. You CAN accidentally cause more skin creases - but - duh - just use another smoothie while you&#x27;re drinking your morning coffee, to solve that problem. I only use these for wrinkles below the corners of my mouth. And even though said wrinkles are caused by sagging skin it still fixes the problem. I use every single strip and I just cut the large ones into sections I can use. Yes - they can be hard to see and remove from their backing, but I just sigh, turn up the lights and find a pair of reading glasses. Despite their flaws they really do work and their gentleness makes frownies look and feel cumbersome in comparison.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts, but I said, &amp;#34;Why not?  For $15.95 it&#x27;s worth a try!&amp;#34; (and I sure never want Botox).  Gotta say, I&#x27;ve come around.  These Smoothie strips REALLY do help.  Not a complete cure, of course, but that&#x27;s only because I can&#x27;t seem to stop making faces!  I never realized just how dramatic my facial expressions are, until I tried to stop making them...  Now, I get why I have these lines!  I always thought it was dry skin, or MY skin, but now that I&#x27;ve got these great little strips, my skin DEFINITELY looks much smoother.  I love my new secret weapon!!  I wear them around the house, even though my kids make fun of me.  However, my mom even thought I looked younger!  Now, she wants to try them too.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it’s clear and you can hardly see it on your face. I bought another brand, Frownies I think, years ago and couldn’t bring myself to use brown shipping tape on my face. UGLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it hard to believe anyone prefers them to Smoothies. Smoothies are more effective too. I’ve tried others as well, I forget the names but they didn’t do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing about all of these wrinkle removal products to keep in mind is that you can’t expect them to function like Botox. I laugh aloud at these reviews that say one half hour later I can see my wrinkles again. Of course they come back if you make the same facial expressions that caused them in the first place. Stop doing that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to make an effort to modify your extreme expressions and relax your face. This is not a permanent fix; it is a wonderful tool for a quick fix to freshen your skin and takes years off your face. Keep that in mind and you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Terrific product. Nicely presented and thorough instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I do not wear make-up much and do not have time for a lot of cosmetic treatments, but a friend raved about these, so I tried them. I really like them too.&lt;br /&gt;It is an idea that never would have occurred to me, but the product is surprisingly effective. They do smooth my lines (upper lip, for me) for a day or so. The perfect smooth appearance does not last forever, but my lines are less pronounced ....  It makes sense that you have to stop making the facial expressions that caused your lines originally, so I will try to do better in that department. In the meantime, I rely on this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Comfy to use, not itchy, does a good job at removing wrinkles for a few hours.... till you start frowning again. I wear them when i&#x27;m working on the computer since that&#x27;s when I frown most.</li>
    <li> I really like the strips for a few reasons. Each sheet in the package contains strips to cover the entire face which I have used up to 5 times. They are clear and hard to see on your face. The biggest reason I like them is because they work! I can&#x27;t sleep on my back and laying on the side of my face causes  &amp;#34;crinkles&amp;#34; around my mouth, eyes and lids. Applying the strips before bed reinforces and flattens my skin making it harder to wrinkle. I love them!</li>
    <li> Product was shipped immediately.  Have been using this product for several weeks and love the results.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. They don&#x27;t breathe and the adhesive clogged my pores.</li>
    <li> These are just ok. You wake up looking pretty good but by the afternoon, all your wrinkles are back. Not a cure for wrinkles by any means.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works wonders for even established wrinkles.  And very easy to use too; I apply while working at the computer or before driving to work.  100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> I like these but they are drying my skin out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked but these work!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but I had to for this product. For the last few years a deepening crevasse has grown across my forehead that I&#x27;ve been trying to fend off with wrinkle creams. Well, they might help fine lines but creams do nothing for my deep ones. I&#x27;ve tried everything but nothing has worked until now. Enter Smoothies to save the day. I am amazed at what a difference these strips make. My line is almost gone when I peel off the strip in the morning. Amazing. Just one question...why did I not see this product until a few weeks ago!?</li>
    <li> What an Improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using other kinds over the years and I am so excited to have found these clear ones in all the different shapes and sizes.  I am wearing the littlest ones all around- in the car mostly, you can hardly see them. I also like to keep some in my purse for touch-ups. They are so easy to use and stay on really well and they&#x27;re so comfortable I forget I&#x27;m wearing them sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use them all the time, just if I really start to notice my lines. It&#x27;s nice to be able to get rid of them them so quickly!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these facial smoothies! My skin feels so smooth and looks great after I use them. The strips are sticky enough to use again, and there are plenty in a pack, so they can last awhile.</li>
    <li> These little stick-ons are just awesome. I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy they are to use and was especially surprised at the effectiveness of these simple &amp;#34;sticky things&amp;#34; that smooth out our frown lines. They are easy to apply and come off without any discomfort at all  You don&#x27;t  have to wear them nearly as long as Frownies and they are much more comfortable!  An added bonus is that they are very inexpensive for the type of dramatic reduction in wrinkles they produce. I think they are worth every penny, and work far better than any of the numerous wrinkle creams I have tried at exorbitant prices. Smoothies should definitely be a staple in any woman&#x27;s wrinkle-reduction routine if they want to see amazing results. I will be using these for a long time!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I have extremely sensitive skin.  These strips gave me a red rash in all the areas that I used them.  The rash lasted only about a day, but for those of you with sensitive skin, I would recommend you try one small strip before putting them all over your face to test to see how you will react.  I am used to using a silicon decollette pad, so I was hoping these would be similar to that but for the face.  Unfortunately, these strips to be similar to putting a piece of tape on your face.  Maybe they work for some people but not for me!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am young -just turned 30- but I get pillow creases all the time and this gets rid of them for me. (I&#x27;m a tummy sleepr so my face is in my pillow alot of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta say I dont get these reviewers who expect the product to be a permanent fix for wrinkles. Weird to be mad that the wrinkles are only gone for a day They&#x27;re gone for a day! Isn&#x27;t that great?!!! Anyway I am very happy with them... I am using the little ones so I don&#x27;t get those creases between my eyebrows. It works - they disappear and don&#x27;t come back for a long time... but like I said I&#x27;m only 30.</li>
    <li> I love Facial Smoothies for flattening out the smile lines and frown lines that creams just won&#x27;t deal with.  Fillers and botox are soooo expensive, and these work fabulously for the evening!  With Smoothies, I am not afraid to smile again!</li>
    <li> Works as described. I hope it provides a more permanent solution with devoted use. I like that the strips are transparent in addition to the size variety.</li>
    <li> Received them quickly and I love this product!</li>
    <li> Great product - actually works!  I was in an accident 7 years ago and lost a lot of weight while being fed through a tube.  My face developed folds and creases due to dehydration.  Placing the strips on over night seems to push the fat to where it should be.  I grow older every year and gravity also plays a part.  I think I will also wear the strips when I walk on the treadmill to help with the effects of gravity.  I want my daughter who is in her thirties to use them too.  The package says something like wear them in your thirties and never look forty.  I wish I had them at thirty!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it made the wrinkles under my eyes worse. I have these weird criss-cross wrinkles now that I never had. No thanks.</li>
    <li> I like what Smoothies do for my skin. They really do smooth out wrinkles - and as others have said, a lot better than wrinkle creams do. I can definitely see the difference after wearing them, I just have to try and not re-create the lines. I do have to keep using them - several times a week, but it&#x27;s part of my routine now. (Besides, I haven&#x27;t found a better alternative.) Some of my lines are really deep and have taken a while to recover, but to me it&#x27;s worth the effort. They&#x27;ve been a long time in the making, so of course they will take a while to go away. The short ebook helped. I think it is definitely worth reading</li>
    <li> Love these!! The ones that go between the eyes have worked wonders! wish I would have had these when I was in my 20&#x27;s. Would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> the strips are way too stiff and wearing them for a night results in new wrinkles at both sides of a strip. I am not allergic to any cosmetic products but every time I use this I get skin irritation which stays there for a few days and they claim it is hypo-allergenic?!. Too bad it is too late to send them back so they are going to trash.</li>
    <li> I am a 64 year old woman who has tried other wrinkle removal strips.  They were a hassle to use and almost ripped my skin off when removing.  I saw Facial Smoothies Wrinkle Remover Strips on Amazon and decided to give them a try. I started using them in mid-June and have used them every night.  I love the fact that you just put them on your face - no requirement to wet first - and they come off very easily. When I first started my face looked like a patchwork quilt I was using so many on the lines around my mouth.  As time has gone by I have noticed that I now only need to use one or two on each side of my mouth.  My skin is definitely smoother.  Also, I have found that I can cut some of the bigger pieces to use on smaller areas to make them last longer.  I just ordered an additional two boxes and plan to use every night.  They absolutely do not disturb my sleep - I don&#x27;t even feel they are there. Also I have made contact with Cindy Barrett, the creator of Facial Smoothies and she has been very personal and helpful.  I definitely give these 5 stars. :)</li>
    <li> These are clear and easy-to-use, can be worn discreetly during the day if not in real close contact with people..think walking, running errands, outside working or driving in the car. I admit I use these in conjuction with Frownies (which I love as well), and wear those at night. I&#x27;m 51yrs-old and have lived a very active life, working mostly outside and in the sun, wind and elements. Smoothies are a great natural alternative, and certainly cheaper than surgery; you just have to be diligent about using them.  If you have deep wrinkles and crevasses between the brows, like me, give them a chance. I&#x27;m a devoted fan.</li>
    <li> Extremely sticky. I need to try this for a longer period of time. I don&#x27;t like sitting and waiting for 30 minutes while it works.</li>
    <li> These strips are great! I have tried everything else on the market.....and had all but given up. I should have tried these first.  The Strips are easy to apply and very effective..... I didn&#x27;t have to wait weeks to see zero results as with other products, I saw results the minute I removed the first strip. Amazing!! And they are a great value with so many strips in the box, and they can be reused. Wish I knew about these years ago, it would have saved me a ton of money.</li>
    <li> These work very well .I like the clear material.I&#x27;ve tried the other brand and much prefer these.They especially work well on my frown lines.I use them every night .Would definately recommend.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. It sticks to your face like a piece of scotch tape ,not to mention it&#x27;s uncomfortable. I would not recommend this product. I am an esthetician and this is probably one if the worst products I&#x27;ve tried. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I fell for this! Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It only smooths wrinkles while you have this white strip ON you.</li>
    <li> I decided to try these rather than the &amp;#34;Frownies&amp;#34; which I usually use. I don&#x27;t think they work nearly as well- the only good thing is that they&#x27;re clear, so it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing a big paper stamp in your forehead at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;There are too many useless sizes in the box, they&#x27;re a little hard to peel off the backing. I would rather have one box of straight up size for forehead or between the brows sizes, so I&#x27;ll be going back to the Frownies that I love.</li>
    <li> These strips really do smooth out any facial wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve seen the wrinkles return with 30 minutes. Still, I think they are worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> I love these Facial Smoothies.  I&#x27;ve used a similar product and while they&#x27;re fine, Facial Smoothies are virtually unnoticeable, even though I only use them at night.  I still run around the house with them.  And the results are phenomenal.  The large strip worn overnight on my forehead made that area look as smooth as a baby the next morning.  I&#x27;m hooked!!  Who needs foreign gunk shot into their face?</li>
    <li> These are great and work to help &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34; out wrinkles. Although the result doesn&#x27;t last all day, even hours later the wrinkle is softened and I think with repeated use they certainly will not get worse. They are easy to apply and you have several sizes and shapes to choose from.</li>
    <li> Thank you, Facial Smoothies!  I have tried them in several places on my 60-something-year-old-face, and have been very pleased with the results -- they are clear (practically invisible), easy to apply and wear, gentle on the skin, reusable, exfoliating, and most importantly of all, effective at reducing the appearance of lines/wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Very effective.  In regard to certain other reviews, I&#x27;ve found that smaller pieces are less likely to create wrinkles.  Also, you have to experiment a bit to find which pieces work best for which areas.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot. They WORK. Wrinkle creams don’t do much for deep lines but THESE facial Smoothies DO help. I needed to read the directions before I got the hang of putting them on right, and you may have to play around with them to get the best results but once you get the hang of it you’ll be pleased. I am also very impressed with this company and their customer service. I like supporting companies who treat their customers so well and who make their products in the USA.</li>
    <li> I have been using clear flex bandage tape, $1.99 per roll, for a year now. I use it across a furrow line between my eyes, and forehead lines, layered and criss crossed...Typically I put it on before bed, and/or wear around the house at times. This basic tape has reduced my furrow line dramatically. As for my forehead, I used to have 3 lines, now I only have one faint one. It holds super strong....After reading all of the glowing reviews for Smoothies I decided to try it in comparison. Unlike tape the Smoothies have left indent marks in my skin, they do not hold as well, and my lines worsened without use of my tape. I decided to try and use the Smoothies meant for the jowl area, they drove me nuts they were so uncomfortable, not to mention they made no difference despite leaving them on for a prolonged period. I have decided to stick with my more effective $1.99 tape method. I also suggest that you not only try it too, but also do your best to sleep in your back, it reduces wrinkling.</li>
    <li> I am a 50+ woman with a few pronounced wrinkles, some wrinkles that are just starting, and some sagging skin.  At my age, to expect to remove wrinkles more than temporarily without a surgical procedure or fillers would be an impossible task for these or any strips.  I look on the Smoothies as long-term maintenance.  If I can smooth out the wrinkles for 7-8 hours a day while I sleep, that goes a long way in keeping the deep wrinkles at bay for a lot more years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these strips every night after applying my retin-A and allowing it to absorb.  My biggest problem areas are the furrows between my brows, the corners of my mouth, and the areas above and below my lips.  For these wrinkles, when I take the strips off in the morning, the skin is completely smooth.  I haven&#x27;t seen smooth skin between my eyebrows for years!  And I think those vertical wrinkles above and below the mouth really show a woman&#x27;s age, and those are completely smooth.  The effect is temporary, but that&#x27;s 8 hours of not reinforcing my wrinkles, and if I have an event to attend and remove them right before, it really takes years off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Frownies and DermaGen.  The Frownies are too harsh and the DermaGen don&#x27;t stick well for me.  The Smoothies stick well where I put them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use them once.  It is possible to use them more than once, but I feel like if I&#x27;m going to do it, I want a fresh one every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest tip is, you can cut these to contour to your own face. I find for the stubborn nasolabial folds which, at my age, nothing is going to smooth out permanently, it works best if I cut a strip that lays exactly down the wrinkle.  Same for above and below the lip area.  You may get a little indent along the edges of the strip right after you remove it but it goes away almost immediately.  It takes a little experimentation to find the exact size for each area, but once you do, it&#x27;s fast to cut them, it makes them last a lot longer, and it makes a big difference in your results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I wish I had discovered these strips 10 years ago (or earlier).  Start using these before you need them but, if you wait until you need them as I did, they can still help a lot.nd it makes a big difference in your results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I wish I had discovered these strips 10 years ago (or earlier).  Start using these before you need them but, if you wait until you need them as I did, they can still help a lot.</li>
    <li> They are ok.  They do stick well and there is some smoothing effect noticeable when you remove them in the morning, but not as much as the harsher Frownies.  Smoothies sure look better while you&#x27;re wearing them.</li>
    <li> what is wrong with all of us (including me)????&lt;br /&gt;WE KNOW THIS S______WILL NOT WORK YET AS HUMAN BEINGS WE ARE&lt;br /&gt;DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR A MIRACLE.....even though we all are smart enough to know&lt;br /&gt;that tape (and this is what this product is... plain simple tape) is NOT going to remove your wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;NEWS FLASH PEOPLE...unless you have millions, like Joan Rivers to go UNDER THE KNIFE you WILL GET OLD&lt;br /&gt;and get WRINKLES and SAGGING WILL come to your face as you age. The ONLY thing that you can do to look your best and you will not get rid of wrinkles and sagging EVEN IF YOU&lt;br /&gt;DO YOUR BEST...the only thing you can do is.... don&#x27;t smoke, eat right, get sleep and use a NON EXPENSIVE creme. PERIOD. THAT&#x27;S ABOUT IT. THIS IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY ANYTHING&lt;br /&gt;WITH YOUR $15 look for a creme on this site and even the cremes will not stop aging.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, signed &amp;#34;Gail the truth&amp;#34; because I am HONEST. I will always try a product once and give you my honest opinion!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!&lt;br /&gt;PS ..all the other reviewers on here that say this product is wonderful must actually &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; in their minds that this is working.&lt;br /&gt;(and I do think that they delete all the negative reviewers so they can get your money)&lt;br /&gt;They are the same ones that think Santa Claus is flying through the air and the Easter bunny comes along at Easter too! LOL</li>
    <li> It creates new lines if you sleep with them. The results otherwise don&#x27;t last long and seem to deepen the lines I already have.</li>
    <li> 1)The &amp;#34;smoothies&amp;#34; are simply stickers that adhere to your face. NOT comfortable at all. They pull at facial skin when removed; that cannot be good when we are trying to tighten skin- not stretch it!&lt;br /&gt;2) Yes, they VERY,VERY temporarily remove wrinkles. After a few minutes, fine lines are back. If you wash your face, apply moisturizer, or  apply make-up- the magic is gone.&lt;br /&gt;3) They are not reusable- personally I &#x27;d prefer to spend another $10 to get Silcskin strips.&lt;br /&gt;Try Silcskin- I&#x27;m not a huge fan, but they are slightly reusable; the directions on how to keep the strips skicky is below average. BUT, the results are much, much better than these Facial Smoothies.&lt;br /&gt;4) I&#x27;ve noticed that while I work on &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; my existent wrinkles out, the tape creates new wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Not worth the cash, they don&#x27;t work long enough to justify the cost, and if you&#x27;re looking for something effective- look elsewhere. I&#x27;m not a fan and will not buy these again.</li>
    <li> Thus far, I have 4 sheets that the strip wont come off.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the strips I used for 3 wks.  I left them on from 3-6 hrs each and nothing.  I didn&#x27;t not think this was a good product</li>
    <li> I like these, they do reduce the wrinkles, not remove, but reduce.  I wish I had found them sooner, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t of had these wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I love these Facial Smoothies for instant treatments. They make me look years younger without a lot of hassle or expense. I do wear them at night sometimes, but I also wear them in the morning and evening while reading and relaxing. I admit that when I  first saw them, I wasn&#x27;t sure that they could be helpful, but I have been pleasantly surprised. The idea just makes sense. Keep your wrinkles smoothed out and you counteract your facial  expressions. I did have to play with them a bit to get my application technique down, but with a little practice I have become an expert. You will, too. They&#x27;re certainly worth it !!</li>
    <li> I like these much more than Frownies. They are easier to apply and they are reusable. Even I can reuse them and I have insanely oily skin. These have smoothed the lines between my eyebrows which were making me look angry all the time. I am also using them on my smile lines and have noticed they are smoothed out, but come back by the end of the day. I also think the fact that these are made of plastic keeps the moisture in your skin underneath, which has a plumping effect,  This is temporary though.</li>
    <li> I am still experimenting with these.  If i use them every night, I think I would see a noticeable difference.  I am still longing for the plastic dermal lift strips that Amazon is no longer selling......for whatever reason.  Those were my favorite.  My maid thought they were trash and threw those away.....grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!  I want those again.....less trouble and really worked!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have ​absolutely seen a difference in my overall skin texture – deep lines are much less noticeable and fine lines are gone. (Pores seem smaller and cleaner too.) I look years younger (imho).  Obviously creams moisturize your face but these strips actually reshape your skin and remove wrinkles.  You can reuse them, too. (I use mine twice or three times.) Just wash and/or tone your face first.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product. Omg it really does what it says. I am ordering another box. These are safe. I am 7 months pregnant and obviously can&#x27;t get my botox. This will work very well for nights out to dinner when I want to look refreshed. I couldn&#x27;t believe the results. Awesome!!!! These really smooth out those lines. I am now a loyal customer.I am on my 4 box!! I can&#x27;t believe and tell everyone how wonderful these work. Fine lines...gone!! Yes this is upkeep but so are injections. Since using these and a few other things....I have not gone to get botox or any fillers. I will not go to bed without these!! I do wear fresh ones every night. I found that these lock in the hydration of my beauty night routine. I wake up looking better than the day before. If you wear these correctly...they will not cause new wrinkles to form!! I have never tried another brand of facial patches nor will I EVER!! LOVE THESE!! I can&#x27;t tell you how well these WORK!! I am a side sleeper. Now with all the evidence coming out about sleeping and wrinkles i was shocked!! I do get botox and fillers. The last time I went to my Med Spa they said sleep on your back so the botox will not pool in an area since you sleep on your side! I can&#x27;t sleep on my back. I wish I could. These cuttable magic strips truly work and I go about once every 8 months for my botox. These save me sooo much money. You can cut these to your needs. I truly wish I had found these when I was 30 because I would look 20!! These hold all night and you can barely see them. This is the only brand that stays on with my facial oil and moisturizer. I have tried other brands and they would fall off and be stuck to my satin pillowcase. I don&#x27;t have any worries with THESE!!  I can&#x27;t rave about these enough. I am 42 and look about 30. I have these to thank for keeping everything locked into place. Thank you Facial Smoothies for a superior quality product that actually does what it says it will do. I can&#x27;t be without them!!</li>
    <li> Read the reviews for so many products and a simple reality check reminded me that at age 68 there were supposed to be wrinkles . . . what about that heredity thing and my mother? No wrinkles and that porcelain complexion that belongs to green eyed blondes! Smoothies are noninvasive, easy to use and they are effective! Marked improvement after just one night . . . forehead and that line in between the brow line for me.  I am impressed with the results. No muss no fuss and not expensive . . . great combination and a great choice for me! The package contains directions with diagrams. Simple  to follow directions that help make a new product easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Cucumber and Pomegranate peel masks by Freeman and they are gentle enough for daily use. Very thin layer and a time out to relax for 10 minutes. The gel is a bit sticky so you don&#x27;t need very much . . . know that you&#x27;ll need to wash your hands. These offer a clean surface for the Smoothies and I&#x27;m going to continue using them with the Smoothies! I have dry, sensitive skin and just happened to find the Freeman products  on Amazon. I was not familiar with the brand and the cucumber mask that I once used has been discontinued. With the help of Amazon reviews, do I really want to go &#x27;shopping?&#x27;  With &#x27;prime eligable&#x27; and 2 day shipping, there is the convience of multiple reviews and it is so much easier for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product to smooth out a small wrinkle /cut on my cheek&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with Facial Smoothies ,  comparing to \\&quot; Frownies\\&quot; (similar product ) , Facial Smoothies are much easier to use and apply.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;although it looks like  regular scotch tape , I&#x27;ve tried using scotch tape before- Very Bad Idea ! always had redness and irritation&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had any skin issues when using this product</li>
    <li> Item delivered as listed and in a very timely manner, kudos to Nature Provides All - I give the company 5 stars. The product is disappointing, but it&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault...seller is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;If you had a good stiff piece of tape you could achieve the same results as these Smoothies, thus the disappointment.</li>
    <li> These are great - an addition to frownies - at least on can remember to remove frownies in the morning. I think I&#x27;ve caught myself with tape on my face. . . I think people are to &amp;#34;polite&amp;#34; to mention. Or maybe they cant see?!</li>
    <li> I really like the triangular shaped patches for the &#x27;eleven&#x27; lines, they are very effective, easy to use and far superior to any of the other adhesive &#x27;wrinkle patch&#x27; products on the market. I haven&#x27;t used any of the other patches on the sheet so can&#x27;t comment on those. It would be ideal if the triangular patches were available separately but I will still continue to purchase in the current format.</li>
    <li> As I worked with these patches and found a way for them to work for me,  I&#x27;m noticing a change for the good.  My original rating was only a one star.  I found solutions that worked for me to hold the products in place....Surgical tape or even transparent tape.  I am also impressed with the creator herself Cindi actually contacting me.  I&#x27;ve contact Frownies several times with a question and   they have never answered.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any another product like this, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, however the strips do work - but not much.  Perhaps I am just too old (late 50&#x27;s), and my wrinkles have been etched in there for so long that the strips can only be expected to do just so much (probably).  If I go to bed at night wearing them, when I get up in the morning and take them off, the smoothing effect only lasts for about 20 minutes. Usually, there are some reddish edge lines from the strips as well, so by the time those disappear, my wrinkles are back!</li>
    <li> I probably didn&#x27;t use these correctly, I know that others have said they work well.</li>
    <li> Literally looks like my wrinkles have been removed after only a half hour of wearing them ONCE. I&#x27;ve tried almost every product and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard fabulous things about this product and can&#x27;t wait to try it. I know this manufacturer is reliable, unlike others on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, this seller gives you a good product, and a great variety of the smoothies.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, SKC.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, but I don&#x27;t like the fact that there&#x27;re so many shapes. I only use it between my eyes and there&#x27;re very smoothies for that. Too much money for very little product. I&#x27;ll stick to the frownies. I do have to say that they&#x27;re easy to apply and like that they&#x27;re transparent.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd box of these..thank the heavens for this product!! Every night I wear the patches on my &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; in between my eyebrows and on the nasolabial fold lines (from corner of nose almost to edge of lip). I cannot believe what a difference they make. Lines are all smoothed out in the morning. By the late afternoon, depending on how much I&#x27;ve laughed or furrowed my brow, the lines start to reappear but not nearly as bad as when I go without the patches. I&#x27;ve also used Frownies, and theirs are so uncomfortable and just do not work for my nose area. Plus they are very obvious. I love that these smoothies are clear, so I can wear them around the house during the day if I want (and I do for extra smoothing!). Also, the great thing is that these keep your face in place while sleeping on your side etc. I can&#x27;t say enough good things. They are my best kept beauty secret hands down. Please keep making them so I don&#x27;t have to get Botox!! : )</li>
    <li> I just purchased my fourth box so I obviously think they make a difference. I&#x27;m 59 years old and people always think I look much younger and often comment that I have &amp;#34;no wrinkles.&amp;#34; The truth is that I do have wrinkles, but Smoothies smooths them out so they aren&#x27;t so deep. The main wrinkles I&#x27;ve used Smoothies for are the vertical ones between my eyebrows, but they have also helped smooth out the horizontal lines across my forehead. Also, I am able to reuse them repeatedly, sometimes more than 14 times! The key is to first apply a really good serum and then a facial oil and then a night cream. Let them absorb before applying the Smoothies. There have been times when the Smoothies have irritated my skin, but only when I haven&#x27;t been taking proper precautions.</li>
    <li> when i sleep at night, i tend to furrow my eyebrows. hard. all damn night. i didn&#x27;t discover that i was doing it until the damage was already there. all that said, i don&#x27;t use this product to get rid of my &amp;#34;angry eleven&amp;#34; wrinkles; i use it to prevent them from deepening. *i* can&#x27;t stop myself from furrowing in my sleep, but this product can--so i love it. the only reason i don&#x27;t give it five stars is that they don&#x27;t provide a pack of JUST between the eyes stickers, so i have to hand cut the big forehead ones to fit the area after i&#x27;ve used up the triangles. i generally reuse each patch for three nights before i throw it away, though, so a pack lasts a while and is a much better value for me than the furlesse brand.</li>
    <li> 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROC lolo Rock&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months 1 week ago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hdhili1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; FROM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oklahoma, USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was online looking for the best product that would help with wrinkles round my mouth area. I research many other product even products that cost more than facial smoothies in the end I took a chance on facial smoothies and purchased it.  I started using the product and after 3 days I begin to notice a change around my mouth area. I was happy to see that facial smoothies was during what it promise it would do fill in and plump up my sagging cheeks and around my mouth area.I am very happy with my purchase and would purchase it again!</li>
    <li> These strips work well. The adhesive is strong, but I would never call it &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;. It feels nice on your skin and does not leave a residue. My skin looks and feels great when I take them off - lines are greatly reduced and my skin looks smoother. You cannot expect the results to last longer than a day, but they are definitely better than wrinkle creams at removing lines, and using strips a few times a week seems to keep lines reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works like magic and can be re-used so very economical! So happy I found Facial Smoothies.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use if you have sensitive skin.  I tried this out before my wedding and used the little triangles designed for your crows feet.  Well when I took them off it a) felt like I was ripping my skin off b) did nothing for my little crows feet and c) left giant red, sore blotches by the corners of my eyes for a good 12 hours afterwards.  Total piece of crap. You&#x27;d be better off using a piece of Scotch tape.</li>
    <li> They did not work as promised. They were difficult to adhere and retained no ability to re-use if desired. Also, although I used three of the small ones only once, I noticed wrinkles beside the smoothie and where it should have removed the wrinkles, no improvement at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but I just received these today, and I put one on the deep frown lines between my eyebrows, and left it on for about 2 hours. I was stunned when i took it of to see the wrinkle is barely noticeable? Ive bought a lot of things that don&#x27;t work, and really expected this to be the same, but its not. Will be interesting to see the difference when I have them on overnight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like it though if they actually just came in square sheets that you could cut and modify for your own face shape. The forehead ones are not big enough for me, and most of the little shapes will just go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;I think if the manufacturer could do that, they would get a lot more sales, that way they could also be used on neck lines maybe? And also the cheeks perhaps.</li>
    <li> These are better then frownies for several reasons; they are sheer, soft, &amp; easier to remove. They train your face to behave and I love them. I only wish when I put them on my lids, they wouldn&#x27;t drag them down they are a bit to heavy for lids.</li>
    <li> This product is great...use it a few nights each week while sleeping and wrinkles diminish over a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the expense</li>
    <li> Good price. Quick ship. Strips stay on well, but I cannot use them a second time. These strips may make your skin a little red and irritated. Not because of peeling them off but because of the chemicals. My skin gets a little itchy and red around the edges of the strips and I think it&#x27;s due to whatever is in the adhesive substance. I won&#x27;t purchase more of these since I&#x27;m not thrilled. My rating: 5 out of 10.</li>
    <li> I found this product because I use another product made by this company which I LOVE, the Nourisse ALL Natural Organic Face Cream. It is simply fabulous – so hydrating. While I think the Smoothies do something completely different than creams, I am thrilled that this company has a cream in their line so I can have the best of both worlds. I find the smoothie results are visible pretty fast. I like that the strips exfoliate my skin too, and I’ve used them only for that purpose at times.&lt;br /&gt;What I learned in the fine print on the box - says &amp;#34;Start when you&#x27;re 30 and you&#x27;ll never look 40&amp;#34;. So these strips are probably meant for 30, 40, and maybe 50 year olds. I am on the highest end of that and I can tell you they work - wish I had found them sooner! Like a lot of things in life, it&#x27;s about maintenance. I’m now using the Smoothies in conjunction with the Nourisse face cream and am loving this regime : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews and I have to disagree…I followed the instructions using them only once a day -and they don’t irritate my skin.  Then again… my skin is well hydrated from the Nourisse cream!  Also, the package says they are &amp;#34;used in hospitals worldwide&amp;#34;, so they&#x27;ve been thoroughly tested.&lt;br /&gt;I say buy both products…as they make a great skin care regimen!</li>
    <li> Love these! I&#x27;ve tried Frownies and hated them. The application process is no fun (having to manually get each &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; wet first) and feeling like you are ripping your skin off when removing them. Facial Smoothies are SO much easier. You simply peel off the backer and apply. Unlike Frownies, removing them is easy and pain-free. I typically just wear these overnight and results are definitely noticeable upon waking up. Forehead lines literally disappear. I love these and just bought two packets to keep on hand. Great product, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> can see results in one use love&#x27;em!! definitely will buy more.</li>
    <li> Have used Frownies for years ( and so did my Aunt for 40 years) I only wish this product was available a long time ago, what a difference! My Husband calls them &amp;#34; face stickers&amp;#34; and these hardly show so no more jokes!</li>
    <li> Smoothies are great,  simple to apply, easy on the skin, nice varieties of shapes  and most importantly they work.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money I don&#x27;t know why I ordered this a weak dumb moment</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and they work wonders! I am able to reuse mine once. They completely take away the lines on my forehead and sleep lines beside my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I sleep with them on and they are so comfortable,  my son has to remind me to take them off before I drop him off at school!</li>
    <li> I put four stars down, because I&#x27;m sure it is my fault that I can not figure out how to use it right. For example first time I used it I put patches under my eyes. When I removed the patches and put my glasses on. It said, don&#x27;t put patches under eyes. Either everyone s writing is getting smaller or I need stronger glasses. I do wish the writing direction was bigger, I truly could not read it with my glasses on. I got a magnifying glass, karma, I use to laugh at my grandma for her huge magnifying glass. Now I wish I had it.</li>
    <li> I ordered both these and the DermaGen crescent patches&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Smoothies&amp;#34; have a greater variety of shapes if you want to use them on other areas of the face. They also provide a greater number of patches per box. And they leave less residue on the face. I have to wash my face after using DermaGen, whereas I&#x27;d be able to use Smoothies as a quick touch up before leaving for an event should I need to someday in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DermaGen are more expensive, but for me they are more effective. They are softer and cover more area than the Smoothies that are intended for around the mouth. The Smoothies for the smile line area are too small and stiff. They often fall off during the night. And when they stay put, they sometimes cause a new line along the edges of the patch, though I do run my fingernail around the edges when I put them on to attempt to prevent this. DermaGen&#x27;s softer, thicker patches do not cause new lines on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I bought the Smoothies particularly to avoid the &amp;#34;smile line dents&amp;#34; from sleeping on my side, I quite like the forehead patch. My tv is on a stand near the ceiling of my apartment, and I have to look up at it. If I slap this forehead patch on before watching tv in the evening, it prevents me from raising my eyebrows when looking up. May as well nip that possibility of wrinkles in the bud before it ever has opportunity to start, right? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve chosen to alternate the two products. Since I don&#x27;t know the precise ingredients used in either product, I&#x27;d rather not have either on my face every single night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do generally like the product. But if I was only going to purchase one product, DermaGen would have the slight edge over the Smoothies in effectiveness for my skin. Yours may differ!</li>
    <li> I am not sure about these it felt like after I wore them I had creases from the folds on my faces and it may had soften the lines but now had creases. Maybe I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Not using them correctly. I wanted to see a dramatic change in th eye furrow as I gave the mommy lines there from worrying.. But it didn&#x27;t help.. Still no Botox for me. Any other ideas for that line natural and I&#x27;m a mom breastfeedinf?</li>
    <li> great idea and seems a great company.  wouldn&#x27;t stay on my face so I retrned.  nice people though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other forms of this type of product and this is by far the BEST. Frownies were a pain in the ass and others aren&#x27;t worth mentioning. The fact that these are clear is fantastic! I have bangs and always sleep with an eye mask. So I put these on at night, pull my bangs down, have my eye mask on my forehead like sunglasses (yes, the fact of it they&#x27;re on my forehead helps relax me before bed as part of my nightly ritual...) Anyway, with all that going on, no one ever notices what I have on ironing out what Botox used to freeze. This truly is the antidote to Botox!&lt;br /&gt;I keep an exacto knife blade in the bathroom by the strips. When I run out of the ones shaped like what I need, I simply slice off the size I need from a bigger section and form it into the size I need. Plus, I usually cut little strips to pull back the skin and prevent any weird edge marks that can sometimes appear.  The best part is, I can use them for about 2 nights, sometimes 3.  So when I have a makeshift shape put together, I simply stick it back on the paper it came off of in the morning, then use it another night without having to go through playing Tetris to make it again.  Seriously, by using these nightly on the lines I used to hate, that Botox used to freeze, are gone. I&#x27;ve actually had people ask me if I&#x27;ve gone back to using Botox. Hell, no...&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s a lot of work, but it&#x27;s far better than injecting s*** into my face. I had a near death reaction to a cosmetic injection a few years ago. Literally - near. death. Had a massive stroke and was in the hospital for 5 weeks. This is a FAR better alternative than Botox! And my face still moves so I don&#x27;t look like some sort of neanderthal wax figure. Lol. Sad thing is, I tried to use Frownies before my NDE. They weren&#x27;t worth the time or effort so I gave up on them and gave into the Botox addiction. Had I discovered Facial Smoothies before the incident, who knows, life might not have thrown me such a curve ball. But at least I&#x27;m still here and I can point people away from injections and toward natural alternatives. This is the holy grail of wrinkle remover strips, I promise!&lt;br /&gt;Just say NO to injections. :)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00FEMO2I0 Facial Smoothies Wrinkle Remover Strips - rapid anti-wrinkle treatment]]&#x27;m still here and I can point people away from injections and toward natural alternatives.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Smoothies for about a week now for expression lines on my forehead and next to my eyes.  I just turned 30 and was considering Botox but am still scared about starting that.  I&#x27;ve been wearing these while I sleep and put them on my freshly cleaned face at night.  I also use Tretinoin (a prescription retinol).  But have switched to applying that in the mornings because I don&#x27;t want to interfere with the stickiness of the Smoothies.  My kids looked at me funny and my husband just thinks &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34;.  My daughter asked if she will have to wear them when she&#x27;s older....I did my best to avoid that conversation!  So happy I found this product!  I find I squint the most in the middle of the night when I turn the light on to go to the bathroom or when I check my phone....now I don&#x27;t have to worry about that!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have found the smoothies work better than any other product of this type. It is wonderful to wake up to see that my frown lines are smooth. I look refreshed! I recommend this product to anyone who is interested in a smoother complexion!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  I used it carefully and never saw even a slight improvement on my relatively mild mouth lines.  Others mentioned that the nasolabial fold (lines on each side of your mouth) lines are not improved (even temporarily) and that is true.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This product serves my purpose well.  Besides using for anti-wrinkles,I used it underneath a Cpack for Sleep Apnea  to pad the hose apparatus.  Good product!</li>
    <li> AWESOME.  I AM REORDERING THESE SMOOTHIES. LOVE THE EASY APPLICATIONS AND MORE THAN THAT THE RESULTS ARE VERY NOTICEABLE.  I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A SKEPTIC ON PURCHASING ITEMS ON LINE, BUT THIS ONE IS A DEFINITE KEEPER.  RECOMMEND HIGHLY.</li>
    <li> Super fast! Great product! Thank you.</li>
    <li> These did not stay on my skin. I did what it said, and they moved around. They also left imprints on my face where the edges of the strips were. I would not buy these again. I am returning.</li>
    <li> Did not perform as described.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely NOT for mature skin or skin which has lost any amount of elasticity. What happens is that after you smooth the skin in opposing directions and apply the product to the flattened out area where the wrinkle lies, the skin around the application bunches up and creates creases which themselves look like lines. This product is for skin which has full elasticity and is showing first signs of mild lines. My forehead has full skin elasticity and the product did work just fine on the brow lines. I have lost some elasticity around the mouth and there this product only made things worse as mentioned before. So, great for skin maintaining full elasticity, not all all for skin which has lost even minute amounts of elasticity.</li>
    <li> Great product, tried a few different brands, used one brand for 3 year costing me a lot of $. So I decided to spread my wings and try some other&#x27;s. Facial smoothies are reasonably priced you get more than any other brand,and they work better. Now let&#x27;s be real,you can&#x27;t remove wrinkles with patches,you can reduce the way they look. Less noticeable, which is what I want,and that&#x27;s what they do! So for me I will continue to use this product. 5 stars</li>
    <li> Works as promised. I have also used Frownies and DermaGen.  I would rate them as follows: #1 Smoothies, #2 DermaGen, #3 Frownies</li>
    <li> These work for minor upper lip lines and  smooth out those puppet lines temporarily if you leave them on long enough. I found them to be not worth the results for the trouble</li>
    <li> I was skeptical for sure.... but the first night I used it between my brows - I saw a difference.  They are comfortable - clear in color so you don&#x27;t even know you have them on - and really help flatten out my &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my brows.  So far - So good!</li>
    <li> I REALLY LOVE THESE ARE EASY TO USE .  JUST STICK BUT I DO HAVE A HARD TIME REUSING THEM WHIC H IS OKAY TO ME BECAUSE THE PRICE IS REASONABLE . QUICK APP GREAT EFFECT&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO LOVE THE CUT OUT SHAPES , THEY ARE EXACTLY PERFECT FOR ALL THE IMPORTANT PARTS</li>
    <li> These are amazing!  I use them every night. Great results!!  I highly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> Facial Smoothies, does exactly what is says it will do. My mother had been complaining about lines on her face and has tried everything under the sun. From the drug store product to the most expensive department store face creams and serums, nothing worked for her. Determined to help my mother find a solution, I started doing my research about Anti-Wrinkle products. I came across Facial Smoothies and was immediately intrigued by the name, I wanted to learn more...I thought to myself, it cant be this easy, but it was, for my mother. She used the trips as instructed, she actually sleeps in hers and immediately saw results. I can&#x27;t believe how much her skin has changed, not only is her skin smooth, but the most prominent wrinkles have begun to disappear. She has this airbrushed look about her, that&#x27;s just amazing. I&#x27;m always skeptical of new products and facial products at that, but these wrinkle remover strips actually work. Me and my mom now swear by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered one box for myself, I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, yet but will use Facial Smoothies to prevent them. I want my skin to look as good as my mother&#x27;s..funny because she should be saying that about mine..lol. Facial smoothies is definitely a great product. Anyone looking for a great inexpensive anti-wrinkle treatment should use Facial Smoothies. It&#x27;s easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> They would be very good except for the fact that it is difficult to see the patches, due to the white on white paper.  If the patches were on colored paper I would rate it higher.</li>
    <li> I love the eye and forehead patches but the smaller odd pieces weren&#x27;t very helpful to me.</li>
    <li> Love the Smoothies.  I&#x27;ve re-ordered.  They really do &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.  The fact that they are almost invisible and adhere so well is definitely a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I put them on at night where needed and wake with a smoother looking face! Now, please invent a covering for aging hands!</li>
    <li> These work!  Love them!</li>
    <li> I have some creases in my forehead that have crept up on me over the years (especially becoming more permanent and unable to relax them in the last 5 years). I am 36.  I find myself waking up each morning with a furrowed brow and difficulty relaxing it. Getting to the point of thinking botox would be my only answer to relax my forehead.  After one night of wearing this, my crease between my brows was smooth for the first time in 5 years.  I wear it to bed, and find it gives me a gentle reminder to relax &amp;#34;3rd eye&amp;#34;.  I wear them while putting on my make up and driving to work too, finding those are the most common times that I wrinkle my forehead. I keep a sheet of them everyone, so that I can use them and reuse them anytime I need them.  I noticed that all of my family members do the same forehead wrinkling behaviors, so I am hoping I can combat what I see if my genetic trends. I will definitely buy these again, but don&#x27;t have to too soon, because they are reusable for several uses and the packages comes with so many sheets.</li>
    <li> the sticky tape hurts to pull off and it does nothing for wrinkles</li>
    <li> These are amazing after a week of wearing them my 33 year old face looks 18 again.  I&#x27;ve been carded in stores and questioned as to how old I am I have 4 children and it made people wonder.  I paid regular use of these with face lift tape by secreat pro and I&#x27;m back toy prime years instantly! Better than all the creams and pills I&#x27;ve tried for anti aging.  Easily as effective as cosmetic surgery.  Down side is that it doesn&#x27;t last if u do t keep doing it... To bad but I&#x27;ll continue to use because of the perfect results</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!! This product has changed the appearance of all my face lines for the better! I look fresh every morning I take them off. Such an amazing product I will buy for as long as I can!!!!</li>
    <li> I really love these things. They aren&#x27;t botox, and it&#x27;s foolish to expect them to permanently eliminate deep wrinkles. Even botox isn&#x27;t permanent!!! I feel like these prevent any further damage to my problem areas.  I think I frown and squinch up my face while I sleep. LOL!! But I think I can keep further damage at bay by using my Smoothies. I like that they stay on where they&#x27;re applied and remove easily and very gently in the morning. Sometimes I can even get a couple nights out of them! And I think the price is very reasonable. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> It seems to help.  I guess you have to use them at least 3 x a week.  I wish they had the strips for the upper eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can keep them for a while until they don&#x27;t adhere.</li>
    <li> no DOUBT these take the wrinkles out - but they make their way back lol the longer you wear and more consistent they do make a difference. i  also use in conjunction with kiehls deep wrinkle cream - making some progress.  i&#x27;m almost 35 - trying to fight the early onset forehead wrinkles! :(</li>
    <li> This product makes good common sense- it smoothes out the wrinkles temporarily and the more time you spend without the lines, the less likely they are to deepen or remain.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I am not &amp;#34;between botox&amp;#34; treatments because I&#x27;ve never had one but I&#x27;ve found these strips provide a small but noticeable difference. The trick is that they must be used every single day for the results to be noticeable over time. I have deep creases between my eyes and, for a few hours after having the strips on all night, the creases are definitely reduced. They will never go away but this treatment takes the edge off, if you know what I mean. I only wish I could get them solely for one area because a lot of the strips go to waste since they are cut in a variety of shapes and sizes.</li>
    <li> One package lasts forever when used judicially. I use each strip for about a week. When the size I prefer is used up on one sheet I just cut larger ones to fit. There is a wide variety of shapes and sizes, so just pick or make what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wrinkles have been there a long time. The worst canyons are those caused by pressure from sleeping on my side. The deep lines from the corners of my eyes down my cheeks are kept at bay with a little strip support each night. Don&#x27;t expect a total face lift from these strips, but if you figure out how and where to use them they will make a big difference. They are nearly invisible and I&#x27;m not surprised that some folks use them in photo shoots with \\&quot;mood\\&quot; lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a long term fix. Keep using them and keep enjoying the results. Quit using them and your muscles will quickly go back to old wrinkly habits. It is interesting to look at your face with strips in place and \\&quot;remember when...\\&quot;</li>
    <li> These are kind of fun.  I have these two deep vertical lines between my eyebrows.  I wore one of these overnight and when I took it off the lines were completely gone!  Of course they were back within 15 minutes but it was cool to see my face without them - it&#x27;s been a long time. These would definitely be good for photographs, wedding,whatever.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen any long term improvement from extended use, but I&#x27;m happy with them.  They were inexpensive and it&#x27;s cool to see my face without wrinkles every once in a while.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this item.  They don&#x27;t work for me.  It states you can wear them over makeup.  Then reapply makeup?</li>
    <li> They work well, work best before bedtime. Lasts about 2-3 hrs before heavy wrinkles are visible again. Can&#x27;t help but wonder if medical tape will give same results at less than 1/4 of the cost</li>
    <li> These are too small for my forehead and I don&#x27;t think they work nearly as well as Frownies.  Now, if only Frownies would make a big, one piece sheet for the forehead so there wouldn&#x27;t be any little lines from the stupid triangular shaped pieces, I&#x27;d be happy.  I just need one big forehead-sized piece!  Why is that so hard to get???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited:  Owner of company promised to send me plain sheets of the stuff so I could cut my own to fit my whole forehead.  Never got anything.  Oh well.  So much for that product.  Back to Frownies.</li>
    <li> Not great at all. Poorly packaged-should have easier peel-off &amp; repositioning.</li>
    <li> I ordered my first box of Smoothies a couple of months ago and am ordering my second box today.  I am a former Frownies user, and I find Smoothies to be FAR superior, both in ease of application and removal as well as results.  I also appreciate how almost invisible they look while I am wearing them.  My husband doesn&#x27;t even notice them when I have them on!&lt;br /&gt;I use Smoothies sometimes at night while sleeping but also if I get up in the morning and see areas where I have caused creases because of the way I sleep.  I put them on while I am having my coffee and getting ready for the day.  All in all, they really do work, and I would recommend them for correction as well as prevention!</li>
    <li> immediate results on frown lines.</li>
    <li> Smoothies are by far the best- easier to use, transparent, and a great value, but I&#x27;ve used all the different brands and types, so I can give you a complete review. First, Frownies are ugly brown gummed paper and are a pain to tear apart and lick. The DermaGen ones are not much better looking and you only get 28 patches (one sheet) in a package. (If you can call an open plastic bag a package- that&#x27;s what they come in.) Dermagen&#x27;s have an icky-gooey consistency, didn&#x27;t stay on my face and were painful to take off. They also didn&#x27;t remove my wrinkles as well as Smoothies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to my favorite. Facial Smoothies are clear- you can hardly see them on your face - especially the smaller ones. I use them in the car on the way to work and parties all the time. There are 120 in a package, so they&#x27;re a way better deal than the others. I reuse them- sometimes a few times, so they last a long time. They stick the best, yet are the most comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve never bothered my very sensitive skin and I use them 3 or 4 times a week (yes, you have to keep using them unless you get botox- and you have to keep doing that, too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a makeup artist, and use Smoothies to create a wrinkle filler effect on my clients before I apply their makeup. They work better and longer than any wrinkle filler I&#x27;ve tried. I leave the strips on for about 20 minutes, and when removed, not only are my clients super happy and impressed, but I have the smoothest canvas ever to work with. There are no more lines, so there is no where for makeup to settle into! It&#x27;s really raised my game. I love Facial Smoothies!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 64 and thanks to these little babies (which I wear when no one is around but sometimes forget to take off!) I have very few wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Helps to keep the deep lines between my eyes smoother. Put them on at night on dry skin, after all moisturizer is dry or wipe with cotton ball before apply.  There are plenty of shapes and sizes to fit your needs. I like the cured ones for this application. I never reuse, they are pretty cheep for what they can do. I find them more comfortable (and invisible) compared to the old paper Frownies.</li>
    <li> I am 28 and starting to see smile lines so I started wearing these at night and when I&#x27;m in front of the computer at home. I haven&#x27;t used them enough to notice longterm results, but when I take them off in the morning my face is smooth. The lines do come back, but I think I&#x27;m still doing some good wearing them part of the time. The fact that products like this have been around for a hundred years or so really makes me think we&#x27;re on to something here. They stay on well and my husband says he can&#x27;t tell when I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
    <li> I have been trying wrinkle fillers and went on Amazon to see what they had, and I found Facial Smoothies. I am very happy with how they remove my lines. They work better than any wrinkle filler I have used. I am able to reuse them 3 times just like they say. A simple, effective anti-wrinkle treatment.</li>
    <li> I really like these Smoothies, with your face perfectly clean you can wear them up to 4 or 5 times.  Once you get a wrinkle, it is never going to completely disappear, but these strips will minimize them.  I have used other kinds and they are too obvious unlike these that are clear and you can hardly see them on your face.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I like these strips and they really do work. They are thin and comfortable. My only complain is that I wish they had some larger curved shapes. I don&#x27;t like the triangles for my eyes - would rather have crescent shapes, but the crescent shape they do have is very small. My favorite shape is the large forehead strip, but it doesn&#x27;t cover my entire forehead, so I find myself trying to fill in he edges with the other strips.</li>
    <li> I really love this product because it works fast.  I would put them on in the morning while getting ready and by the time I left they filled in the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my eyes.  You can also wear overnight to really erase the lines but a quick fix is possible as well.</li>
    <li> I am a mask fan and I have lots of masks. This becomes my favorite! I really like this product. my skin looks tight and bright after I used it. Also you can use them everywhere and anywhere. So easy to use and you will get fantastic results. Great price for great product. Definitely will order more.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using these wrong, but I did not like these at all. First, they were very hard to remove from the paper backing and almost hard to tell if one had already been used. Second, they are not all that easy to apply. Yeah, I know you just are suppose to stick them on wherever you want, but for me, they just would not stick properly. They lifted and looked wrinkled, when the purpose of these is to help get rid of the wrinkles. They also did not feel very good on my face. I do not wear bangs and the very few times I did, they drove me crazy! That is how these strips felt on my face. Maybe I was doing something wrong, but I can&#x27;t see what. It&#x27;s not rocket science, after all. One other thing. The few times I was successful in wearing one of these strips, it was on my forehead. I woke up the next morning and when I removed the strip, there was a shape the size of the strip that almost looked molded into my forehead!!! It took a few hours for that to go away. Needless to say, I wouldn&#x27;t use these again, as they did nothing but aggravate me. I may be in the minority, as everyone else raves about them. Too bad I can&#x27;t. Fast shipping &amp; well packaged.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this worked for others but these are pretty useless for me :(</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time, was easy to use and did the trick. I would recommend that others try it! I will be buying more!!</li>
    <li> These are nice because they are clear and they don&#x27;t rip your skin off like Frownies.  But there aren&#x27;t a lot of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; ones--the big forehead ones.  So I have to buy a lot more packs than I did with the Frownies because I only need the forehead ones.  Oh well, they work so nicely and I don&#x27;t want to go back to having a sticky brown square on my head.</li>
    <li> Absolutely not worth buying</li>
    <li> I am so happy with Facial Smoothies!! I had no idea that I get such great results without Botox or a surgical intervention. It&#x27;s really incredible. Wrinkles simply disappear. I&#x27;ve been using them for special occasions, or when I just want to look refreshed. But I am going to start using them nightly for longer lasting results. I will be a long-time customer of Facial Smoothies because they work!</li>
    <li> I used these Smoothies on my &#x27;parentheses&#x27; lines around the sides of my mouth and saw instant results.  I then applied them to the laugh lines on my forehead and noticed how they appear to diminish as well.  These are amazing, safe, easy to apply and I had fantastic results.  I am never going to have injections done on my face, and I am so thrilled the results from Smoothies… Thank you, thank you… I will be ordering more !!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I’m reaching my big 30 and have always had a youthful look with no grey hairs or wrinkles… until recently. (yikes).  I spent hours looking online for something that looked like it would work (and wouldn’t cost me an arm and a leg).  I have never really been a fan of creams so the smoothies strips looked interesting.  I saw the high star rating and good reviews, so I thought why not try them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASANTLY SURPRIZED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a change in my expression lines on my forehead and under my eyes.  They are easy (and comfortable) to wear around the house.  The fact that they can be used more than once is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only started using them but I am looking forward to outcome after long-term use.</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews, I decided to give these a try.  I love them and am on my second set.  I wish they made one large strip for the neck.  I will sometimes combine several of the larger strips for my neck.  I am 65 years old and put these on before bed about 4 times a week.  By the morning, your wrinkles are gone.  As good as Botox although only lasts about 12 hours.  Also if you are going some place special, put them on an hour ahead of time.  They can be used several times before they lose their stickiness.  I will never be without these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 6 months now and they seem to work, though I didn&#x27;t have much of a wrinkle problem to begin with, sort of preventative use I suppose.</li>
    <li> I am currently using my second box of Smoothies. They are very economical - each set is reusable for about a week. I&#x27;m a side sleeper and use these nightly after cleansing and applying a Vitamin C serum. Instead of waking up with deep creases, I have a smooth refreshed look.  I&#x27;ve gotten far better results using Smoothies than a $200 jar of La Mer. In fact, Smoothies have rolled back the clock about 5 years on my facial lines ( which admittedly were mild at age 55) and now seem to be helping time stand still.  I consider them indispensable!</li>
    <li> Have hardly used my purchase because they are hard to see and the shapes aren&#x27;t big enough. Would not recommend. Sorry</li>
    <li> Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a skeptic about these and the first day I used them for the laugh lines around my mouth, my mom who is 71 told me I looked like a monster, but after 2  nights of sleeping in them I see an improvement already, the lines around my mouth are not as deep and prominent. I plan on staying with this product and I will re-examine my results and post in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> They are OK, but I really only needed them for between my brows. All the other sizes went to waste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 54 and have started to show some lines around my mouth. I used these strips for two weeks. In the morning, I found the wrinkles had smoothed out some, but new deep wrinkles had appeared at the edges of the strips. I followed the instructions to pull 1/8 inch of each strip all around, but that didn&#x27;t help. My skin is too saggy and tends to pucker at the edges of the strips. And the improvement I saw first thing in the morning lasted for only a couple of hours. So I&#x27;ve stopped using the strips and will not reorder. If you&#x27;re younger and have tighter skin, these strips might work. But if you have saggy, loose skin like me, you might create even more wrinkles with these strips.</li>
    <li> Love these! Stick well, remove easily w/ soap and water.  Would like to see sheets w/ the same shape on the sheet, rather than sheets of different shapes so I can purchase the shapes I use the most.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have used a few of the brands and Facial smoothies really do the work. They are much more discreet. I am so grateful and the new sheets are even more usefull!</li>
    <li> i was using furlesse, which i really liked, but when i ran out decided to try these facial smoothies, as they are basically the same material but seemed to come with more options and sizes.  i have used them twice and they honestly make me look worse and it takes hours to look normal again.  after using these (the wide half moon shaped forehead one) , i have weird vertical wavy lines on my forehead and they create even more lines, on either side of the strip. i used the little triangle btwn brows last time and again it left worse lines all around it. suffice it to say, i&#x27;m back on amazon right now ordering more furlesse, or maybe i will try frownies this time.  i have a whole box of facial smoothies i wasted my money on :(</li>
    <li> Great product will order it again. thank u thank u!</li>
    <li> I love it. Does wat it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using these every night, I&#x27;m 56 and have starting to wrinkle especially between my brow lines.  These really help alot!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it does make a difference from before. The result is desapointing</li>
    <li> These are clear plastic stickers in various shapes.  If only I could buy the forehead ones in bulk.  The others I dont need and are just wasted money.  I like it that I can use lots of lotions underneath and it sticks really well.  Taking it off is a breeze, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not repurchasing at this time because I feel it is not economical.  I can resuse them, but they have residue of the previous night on it - grosses me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good if you have lots of $$ to keep up the habit and need to have a sticker on every area of your face.</li>
    <li> These will not permanently remove expression lines (permanent wrinkles).  They may diminish them briefly, which is great for a photo shoot or a date.  What these will do, is prevent wrinkles from getting worse while you sleep and prevent sleep lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to know which lines are expression lines and which are preventable sleep wrinkles, look in the mirror and see which lines are cased by smiling, frowning, etc...  Any lines that you can&#x27;t reproduce with a facial expression, are likely from your face pressing against the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting sleep lines that, as I got older, would take longer and longer to go away.  I had a couple of vertical lines above my eyebrow that were becoming permanent.  I sleep on my side, practically face-down, so the pressure on my face causes these &amp;#34;sleep wrinkles.&amp;#34;  I tried a satin pillow case and a special wrinkle pillow, but neither worked really well for me.  I started putting these on that spot above my eyebrow and the sleep lines have gone away.  If I don&#x27;t use them for a night or two, the lines come back.  I get another line under my eye and these are not comfortable enough to wear under my eye at night, so I just put one on there when I wake up and take it off before I go to work.</li>
    <li> Its ok.. I still have trouble putting it on my face...</li>
    <li> Terrible. It&#x27;s a farce.</li>
    <li> Up until now &amp;#34;Smoothies&amp;#34; conjured up in my mind, a cool creamy drink, but loaded with calories.  However, much to my surprise I have found the perfect Smoothie, with absolutely no calories!  It&#x27;s called Facial Smoothies which are strips that actually remove wrinkles with no pain!  It is a great product that is easy to apply and remove.  Treat your wrinkles to a painless experience that will completely amaze you.  No more messy creams or lotions or products that are reminiscent of a torture chamber.  These strips will really work with noticeable results and will impress your friends.  It will be your little secret that it did not take plastic surgery to clear up your wrinkles.  Barbara from New Hampshire</li>
    <li> After having my first child, it&#x27;s amazing how quickly our bodies start to show signs of aging. My forehead and between my eyebrows are beginning to show slight wrinkles and I just turned 31. My friend gave me a few of her facial smoothies and I&#x27;m officially addicted. I don&#x27;t use them every night, but at least every three days. These are so simple, and they really work! I&#x27;m honestly amazed that these haven&#x27;t come on the market sooner. I love sharing these with my friends and seeing their excitement for this product. You won&#x27;t regret buying these!</li>
    <li> really can minimize wrinkles for a short time and would work great on 40 and 50 year olds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about a week now for some expression lines on my forehead, between eyes, and crows feet.  I wear them while I&#x27;m sleeping.  They are awesome and I can already tell a difference.  Trying to avoid Botox for as long as I can, but hopefully won&#x27;t need it!</li>
    <li> It works it just takes some just felt like it was pulling my face together read instructions carefully to get your results</li>
    <li> These work really well! I like these better than frownies, because they work just as well, but are clear. This means I can put them on after arriving home without feeling like I have a paper bag on my face. I use these on my forehead.  I use all of them and start with any shape and using any combination that covers the lines.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t afford botox,so these work great i use one sheet for a full week and wear during sleep time, great for face.  i have been trying them on my neck but to uncomfortable for me plus i am 56yo waited to late.</li>
    <li> They do remove wrinkles temporarily. Unfortunately I broke out and they made my skin itchy and red.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this 10 years ago. I&#x27;ve been trying so many different products to smooth out wrinkles, especially around my mouth.  I love this product.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and the immediate results are astounding.  It doesn&#x27;t last for more than a couple of hours, but I&#x27;m sure with more usage, and with the new gels I&#x27;ve found, I&#x27;ll look 15 years younger within a couple of months, and I&#x27;m already 62.  I&#x27;ve always been the kind of person who would never get botox or fillers, so this product is a dream come true.  I&#x27;ve already ordered another box and wish this was on the auto delivery system.</li>
    <li> It works unless your skin in already sagging. The wrinkles underneath the strips were temporarily smoothed, but it created a crease next to it that wasn&#x27;t there. I&#x27;m giving it to my 40 something daughter who has wrinkles but no sagging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while and it really improves my lines! I&#x27;m a side sleeper and tend to crunch up my face at night. This totally handles this issue and smooths out my face for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used frownies as well in the past but I don&#x27;t like getting them wet and waiting for them to dry. They&#x27;re great too but super annoying and messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the best! By far my favorite.</li>
    <li> Wow! I follow the directions exactly and I add the use of a little bit of retin-a rx about 20 minutes before I use them. My dermatologist explained &amp;#34;static wrinkles&amp;#34; to me with an analogy of using an iron to press wrinkles out. I suspect these work because the &amp;#34;press&amp;#34; the wrinkles and seem to concentrate the retin-a r/x into the static wrinkles. Thanks, I honestly believe this is as good as botox, or at the very least, good between botox and/or fillers such as perlane/juvaderm, etc. Thanks, I wish your little company continued economic success!</li>
    <li> A friend (female) raved about these strips, so another friend (also female; I&#x27;m male) and I decided to try them…sort of as a lark. I&#x27;m actually shocked at how good they are. I haven&#x27;t done the best job of taking care of my skin, and these funky little strips make me look like I&#x27;ve been a whole lot more conscientious than I actually have.</li>
    <li> These are ok. They do leave skin smooth for about half an hour but I wouldn&#x27;t call them anti wrinkle. Kind of annoying to wear at night.</li>
    <li> not as great as Frownies!!</li>
    <li> Okay, I have been using these for a year or so and switched to Furlesse for awhile. I think these might irritate my skin a little more. I wish that there were thin, small strips for lip lines. I definitely cannot get more than one use at a time from these, so really it is like a half month&#x27;s supply unless you forgo the giant forehead patch and use it when you run out of the small patches to cut more small patches. Still, I appreciate the customer service and would not rule out using them in the future.</li>
    <li> I use these overnight and they have eliminated vertical lines around my eyes that I had for years.  They were caused by creases from sleeping. These strips help smooth the area.  I also use them other places to prevent additional lines from being formed.</li>
    <li> I used there stripes over a year.They are well smooth fine lines on my face.Very easy to use as easily removed without damaging the skin.After I tried a lot of similar products, I believe that this is the best.</li>
    <li> Helps some and lasts a few hours if do overnight.</li>
    <li> I have found that this product not only gets rid of my lines, but also makes my skin looks better in other ways too. Remember Biore Pore Strips? I can’t remember what was in them but these seem to work the same way. At least these make my pores look smaller and I swear that some of the dirt and oil in them also gets whisked away when I take them off. They also help the texture of my skin which is great because I seem to need exfoliating more and more. As I get older my skin also seems to get rougher an rougher. These Facial Smoothies definitely help. I love the way my skin feels and looks when I take them off. If I have a stressful day I do need to use them again the next night but often I can wait a day or two in between (I would anyway-- who has time to do these things every single night?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think these are a good value. You really can use them more than once. I can usually get 2 uses out of them and probably could get more if I tried. (I just don’t want to! - they do get icky with all that dead skin and oil after a couple of uses.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish I’d started when I was younger. My lines are pretty well ingrained at this point. But these definitely smooth them out and make me look better. It is obvious I will have to keep using them so Facial Smoothies you have a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way I have tried other things that are similar to these but Smoothies are much more pleasant to use and less money too.</li>
    <li> The tape is strong and smooths outs my frown lines overnight.  Of course the lines will come back gradually in the morning but if I continue to use them the frown lines do not look as intense.  I have bangs so sometimes I can even get away with wearing the smaller strips on my frown lines out and about.  I would not go to a social event when they are on but would go to pick up my children from school or running to the store or on long trips in the car.  Even the smallest strips smooth out my frown lines when it is actually on.</li>
    <li> I am a first time user of Facial Smoothies and after the results I received I will be a long time user of this effective anti-aging treatment. I have tried high priced creams and treatments and find that the reasonable price and easy use of these wrinkle remover strips are the best! I should mention that the effects are not permanent however they were immediate! Aging doesn&#x27;t ever stop right? I absolutely love using the strips before a party or event, I wear for 60-30 mins before putting on makeup and my face is as smooth as a canvas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I found the information and resources about the REAL CAUSE OF WRINKLES on the Facial Smoothies website very helpful (http://facialsmoothies.com/ebook/). Did you know your facial expressions are to blame? Me either!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Helpful in temporarily &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; wrinkles and retraining muscles to prevent worsening of deep wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Facial Smoothies for some time, now, and I find the product really helpful. I am not one of those women who needs to have a totally wrinkle-free face, and am certainly not prepared to go the Botox route, so the Facial Smoothies are a great compromise. They are slowing down the deepening of wrinkles and do not irritate my very sensitive skin the way other products do. They are almost invisible and comfortable to wear -- when my husband kisses me goodnight he doesn&#x27;t even notice that I am wearing them! I love that Cindy is trying to use natural products -- she has been really helpful and supportive with orders, etc. I will definitely go on buying this product.</li>
    <li> Waste of money for me. The result looks good at first. But those results disappear in as little as 20 min. Maybe good for just before a photo opt. I hate that I fell for this. But no one to blame but myself.....</li>
    <li> Seeem to smooth fine lines!! Fast Shipping!!</li>
    <li> love this product...thanx*****</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old female that woke up one morning and realized that the left side of my face looks 30. I know I know.. 30 is still young. But what I realized was, the left side of my face was aging faster than the right because I sleep on that side every night. So I tried sleeping on my back.. Too uncomfortable! I tried one of those weird crescent shaped pillows where you lay your face in the cut-out. Also not comfortable. Then I tried Furlesse.. Too expensive. Smoothies! These are the best. I put them on all the spots where I am seeing the fine lines starting to form and I can go to sleep at night with ease in the position I feel the most comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was researching this type of product, I came across an article where a dermatologist (if memory serves) said that these patches are useless unless they had a collagen-boosting ingredient. Even though prevention is never useless, that inspired me to kick it up a notch. Before bed, I spray a few sprays of Bioelements Power Peptide over my face. It dries completely and then I out the smoothies on over that. So, all night the peptides are working under the patches. Best combo ever!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I have used other anti-wrinkle creams and these are far best for reducing wrinkles. They don&#x27;t take them away, but fade them.  They do need to be used consistently, in order to work. I had tio accept that aging is a part of life and there is no magic product out there! However, these are the next best thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product after ordering it! I have deep &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines and was willing to try anything. At first, I was using it too much with no creams on my skin. After contacting them thinking maybe I was doing something wrong,  I was given some wonderful advice. The customer service was outstanding.  She told me it takes years to get those wrinkles, but retraining your skin is possible and that I should try a little cream while using. (I have very sensitive skin). It worked like a charm. I was so impatient and wanted the miracle fix. Nothing is. But I am happy to say that with time, my &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines are being retrained and I am noticing a difference! :)</li>
    <li> These do work.  I have deep 11&#x27;s and they do help.  Botox is still the best but this alternative does help.</li>
    <li> Smoothies work great.  They do a better job of smoothing out wrinkles than wrinkle creams.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with the effectiveness of Facial Smoothies:  decided to give them a try with the hope that I would see some improvement,&lt;br /&gt;but they are truly amazing.  They stay on beautifully, I&#x27;ve had no redness or rash, they&#x27;re easy to apply and remove, I can&#x27;t find one thing negative&lt;br /&gt;to say.  I will order more when I&#x27;ve finished this packet and am telling my friends they need to order some, too.  I only hope they&#x27;ll be around as long as I am.</li>
    <li> The biggest waste of money ever</li>
    <li> These are pretty good. I usually wear these at night. For an hour or sometimes until morning. They do smooth out skin by taking off dead skin cells which is a plus. Until I find something better, I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I think these are good for people with just starting wrinkles.  They work but unlike Botox you are constanly pulling the wrinkle apart to use the smoothie and is only a temporary fix,.  I am inclined to think that over time all of the manipulation of the wrinkle pulling it apart and so forth would just lead to that wrinkle getting worse quicker.  It may appear to being doing what Botox is, but Botox is keeping those muscles still for months at a time, even after a while kind of training you not to use them.  With this product all you are doing is moving the line and making it wider to fill it.&lt;br /&gt;I would continue to use this if ihad nothing to lose but i think that it is logical to think that fine lines are going to get worse after a awhile.  I totally do not think this should be used around sagging or soon going to be saggy skin, because those wrinkles need to be pulled up not apart.&lt;br /&gt;I know the product has lots of followers, and the results are good...but not good enough to use on a daily prolonged regimine.  You use this in 20&#x27;s 30&#x27;s by 40 the wrinkle is going to be way worse then it would have been by constantly pulling it apart..</li>
    <li> i just ordered two more boxes of these because they really work!  i had a deep wrinkle on my upper cheek right under my eye every morning when i woke up.  when i use these, it is gone!</li>
