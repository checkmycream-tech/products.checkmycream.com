    <li> Perfect for hair sculpting and braiding</li>
    <li> Good for practicing up hairstyles and  braids.  Initially the hair is very &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; but once you add so product to the synthetic hair it has texture.  Good for the price- hair is thick.</li>
    <li> Hair falls out very easily-don&#x27;t even think about brushing it and hair is very thin.</li>
    <li> Lots of hair! Great length!</li>

    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter... She loves it but I recommend ordering the table attachment.  It&#x27;s a bit cumbersome to use without one.</li>
    <li> Great for cutting and braiding.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this</li>
    <li> Good quality mannequin head. Not real hair hair though. I&#x27;m not sure how it will do with chemical procedures. But i still love it. I can just use it for styling. Good price for the quality. My only compliant is \\&quot;Emily\\&quot; is pretty ugly. But its no matter. Still does what I need it to.</li>
    <li> Really long hair i loved it! Fall semester is going to start I&#x27;m a cosmo  student so they told us we need a mannequin head and the ones they sell at school are twice as expensive.  The one in school are honestly not all that good and the hair is a lot shorter so Im really happy with this head</li>
    <li> I think it works well because if u cant use heat on it ,its.fine. this head is manly used for braiding and hairstyles.</li>
    <li> Her hair is to straight and really silky so some of the braids I was trying to do was not working.  It also breaks real easy.  I would recommending paying more and getting the mannequin with real hair.</li>
    <li> This doll sux can only braid and brush it&#x27;s head okay for a five year old that&#x27;s it can&#x27;t cut or curl this doll :(</li>
    <li> Love it. Going to just use it home to try to learn the newest braiding techniques - getting ready for when my 2 year old granddaughter gets a little more hair! Used Barbie head for my two daughters (now 18 and 34) but this will be better as you can clamp it down on the edge of a table or something instead of holding it between your knees.</li>
