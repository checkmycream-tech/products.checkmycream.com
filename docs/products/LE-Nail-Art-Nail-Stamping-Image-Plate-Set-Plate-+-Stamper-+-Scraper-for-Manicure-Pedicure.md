      <li>and it works wonderfully!</li>
      <li>Not the best buy I&#x27;ve made.</li>
      <li>great product practice makes perfect!</li>
      <li>Great concept but</li>
      <li>I have seen hundreds of videos to learn how it works, but I haven&#x27;t been successful.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>and i loved them</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>I got it on time so good .</li>
      <li>It is good</li>
      <li>.what a mess.good luck and good buy</li>
      <li>Good item</li>
      <li>Also, the stamper does not do a good job of picking up the polish.  </li>
      <li>YOU DO GET SOME NICE STAMPING PLATES TO MAKE UP FOR IT</li>
      <li>I may buy more depends on how others goes,</li>
      <li>so i love just used it yesterday and have already had tons of compliments</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure how it performed but it looked much better than the ones in the store, the plate was metal.  </li>
      <li>This item is fully functional just feels kind of cheap.</li>
      <li>You are better off getting the salon express which can be purchased at walmart, cvs, target, etc.</li>
      <li>and i was expecting a flower one but other than that its a great product the services are good.</li>
      <li>These stamps make it so easy to decorate nails.</li>
      <li>I am still trying to the image on my nail, it looks easy but it takes practice.</li>
      <li>The only thing that is kind of good in this whole kit is the plate!!</li>
      <li>I bought it as a cheap alternative to the Konad system.</li>
      <li>i bought this and was so excited to try it out..</li>
      <li>Slow drying nail polish works best in my opinion.</li>
      <li>no matter how quick we were with it.</li>
      <li>what a waste.it will not work as they say.my little girl was not too happy</li>
      <li>Overall I am satisfied because of the price but be prepared for a cheap product.</li>
      <li>Better to use an old credit card</li>
      <li>I got this for my teen age nieces and they absolutely love it, So much fun to get a mani and a pedi every week.</li>
      <li>the disk holder would be another great product to buy as it is hard to hold and swipe the excess and stamp before it dries</li>
      <li>i will purchase more image plates(konad brand only) and just use the giftcard as the scraper.</li>
      <li>; you get what you pay for&amp;#34; &amp; in this case thats exactly what happened.</li>
      <li>It went back in and I was able to use it.</li>
      <li>Wasnt able to found this product in my area, only online.</li>
      <li>It often does not pick up the polish at all, when it does pick up the polish it often does not pick up the whole image.  </li>
      <li>if it just that it doesn&#x27;t work really well.</li>
      <li>Get the real Konad kit.</li>
      <li>Quick note that there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve for rolling the stamp with my left hand, but</li>
      <li>Do not waste you money!!</li>
      <li>only thing worth keeping is the stamper.</li>
      <li>the money doesn&#x27;t work the plate is too thin to get a good stamp</li>
      <li>Theres no words to describe this other than pure JUNK!!!</li>
      <li>and i also tossed the scraper in the trash, and used and old gift card, it works!</li>
      <li>the image plate has 7 designs on it, and of that 7 only 2 work and turn out very faded at that.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
      <li>so out of this whole set the only thing that works</li>
      <li>I got the Konad double ended stamper for a few dollars more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried cleaning the stamper &amp; plate with acetone between tries, I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and colors of polish, with and without a topcoat, and tried using other plates that I have and have not been able to get a single image to stamp properly or the scraper to scrape evenly.    </li>

    <li> I got this for my teen age nieces and they absolutely love it, So much fun to get a mani and a pedi every week.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my friend on her birthday and it turned out that it doesn&#x27;t even work. It sucks, because now I can&#x27;t even return it. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> The scraper does not scrape evenly, it leaves a streak in the same place each time I scrape the plate because the scraper is not even.  The scraper is not as pictured - there is no metal plate, it is all plastic.  Also, the stamper does not do a good job of picking up the polish.  It often does not pick up the polish at all, when it does pick up the polish it often does not pick up the whole image.  When I go to put the image on my nail it either does not release at all, or releases only part of the image onto the nail.  It appears that the surface of the stamper is too rough and not smooth enough to pick up/release the polish as is necessary for stamping.    In an effort to get the product to work I&#x27;ve tried cleaning the stamper &amp; plate with acetone between tries, I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and colors of polish, with and without a topcoat, and tried using other plates that I have and have not been able to get a single image to stamp properly or the scraper to scrape evenly.    DO NOT BUY THIS!!  I got the Konad double ended stamper for a few dollars more and it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> i bought this and was so excited to try it out.. unfortunately IT DOESNT WORK. the image plate has 7 designs on it, and of that 7 only 2 work and turn out very faded at that. the image plate isnt cut deep enough. the scraper forget about it, it smears the polish across the plate, it doesnt scrape it off at all. i was really mad after trying to get this thing to work for an hour with no luck. i eventually got a nail filer and filed the stamper down some (it worked) and i also tossed the scraper in the trash, and used and old gift card, it works! only 2 of the images on the plate hold polish and transfer onto the stamper.. so out of this whole set the only thing that works is the stamper. i will purchase more image plates(konad brand only) and just use the giftcard as the scraper. dont waste your money on this set.. its not worth it!</li>
    <li> great product practice makes perfect! Slow drying nail polish works best in my opinion. the disk holder would be another great product to buy as it is hard to hold and swipe the excess and stamp before it dries</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product. I bought it as a cheap alternative to the Konad system.The stamper does not work and the designs on the plate are not cut deep enough. What a hunk of junk. You are better off getting the salon express which can be purchased at walmart, cvs, target, etc.</li>
    <li> this scraper sucked so bad. It is metal, and it scraped the plates to all holy hell. im throwing it away in the trash. only thing worth keeping is the stamper. so afriad to use it on my konad or bundle monster plates. what a shame!</li>
    <li> I got this stamper kit and it is nothing like the picture. The scraper is all plastic and does not work. the stamper does not pick up the image. The only thing that is kind of good in this whole kit is the plate!! Do not waste you money!! Get the real Konad kit.</li>
    <li> i was firt introduced to this thing of nail art with stamps when i visited circus circus in las vegas they had 2 small nail polishes the scraper the and the stamper and 2 plates for 70 dollars i bought i and i loved them they worked so well! i lost them throught the years and i dint  know were elseto get them i looked online saw this the plate is a joke the scraper does not have the metal part in the end i would put the polish and remove and everything would come off the plate leaving me nothing to stap wat a waste of money is like 9 dollars including shipping so anoyed i hate wasting money on things that are gonna go in the trash dont waste ur money it does not work</li>
    <li> These stamps make it so easy to decorate nails. Quick note that there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve for rolling the stamp with my left hand, but that&#x27;s operator issues, not product issues.</li>
    <li> stamper doesn&#x27;t work that well, was so disappointed in this product!!!! &#x3D;( some of the images doesn&#x27;t show up as well...</li>
    <li> I like it but it doesnt work as well as I thought it would, cause whenever I put the nail polish on it &amp; scrape it off, the image didnt come out to well.... maybe it was the nail polish I was using.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like I hoped.  I watched videos on how to use this. Seemed simple enough. Didn&#x27;t not get the results I hoping for</li>
    <li> this thing sucks the plate, design are not deep enough, so when you scrape it all the nail polish comes off. and the nail polish doesn&#x27;t stick to the stamper, and it dont transfer onto the nail, its awful, they make it look easy online, but this item sucks!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> the image plate has i nic in it but that doesnt affect its use so i love just used it yesterday and have already had tons of compliments</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say for sure how it performed but it looked much better than the ones in the store, the plate was metal.  The price was also right versus the expensive ones out there.</li>
    <li> i like it, the only thing is that i didnt like its thats it was a fish plate and i was expecting a flower one but other than that its a great product the services are good.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to the image on my nail, it looks easy but it takes practice. Can&#x27;t wait to become a pro !!!</li>
    <li> Good product.Wasnt able to found this product in my area, only online.Lots of choices of differents design.I like the product</li>
    <li> Good It is good I got it on time so good . I may buy more depends on how others goes,</li>
    <li> This item is fully functional just feels kind of cheap. The second I opened it the bottom fell out of the stamper. It went back in and I was able to use it. Overall I am satisfied because of the price but be prepared for a cheap product.</li>
    <li> Great concept but the polish always seems to dry on the plate no matter how quick we were with it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the scraper to even work so I couldn&#x27;t even tell you if the stamper works. Not the best buy I&#x27;ve made.</li>
    <li> what a waste.it will not work as they say.my little girl was not too happy .what a mess.good luck and good buy</li>
    <li> I have seen hundreds of videos to learn how it works, but I haven&#x27;t been successful. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong or if it just that it doesn&#x27;t work really well.</li>
    <li> not worth the money doesn&#x27;t work the plate is too thin to get a good stamp</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was doing it wrong. But I followed the directions. And tried and no matter how fast slow hard or soft I did it. It never worked.</li>
    <li> I WISH I NEVER BIUGHT THIS, IT SUKS ITS NOT CLEAN AT ALL TO USE, SORRY BUT I WONT BUY THIS AGAIN</li>
    <li> Good item but don&#x27;t use the scratcher it ruins the disk. Better to use an old credit card</li>
    <li> Theres no words to describe this other than pure JUNK!!! Theres this saying that says &amp;#34; you get what you pay for&amp;#34; &amp; in this case thats exactly what happened. It took forever for it to get here then, when it finally arrived it wasn&#x27;t even well put together enough so that you could get a smear of nail polish on the sponge like roller that the decal suppose to attach to. We mashed &amp; mashed &amp; never could get a decal to come up on the sponge like thing, not even once so from the beginning it never worked.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT WILL NOT WORK, YOU WILL JUST LOSE YOUR MONEY.....ITS A GIMMICK. YOU DO GET SOME NICE STAMPING PLATES TO MAKE UP FOR IT NOT WORKING THOUGH!</li>
