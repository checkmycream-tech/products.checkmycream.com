      <li>Love this pretty hand soap!</li>
      <li>As I wash my hands it fills the room and takes me to a happy place by an ocean side in some southern country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just so original.</li>
      <li>It smells beauitiful and is clean and organic.  </li>
      <li>soap produces adequate leather with out being too astringent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>At home we wanted something much more gentle and this stuff really fits the bill!  </li>
      <li>I used to find these in local health food store, but they have since d/c the products and have their own brands, which I DO NOT LIKE.</li>
      <li>I think I expected more since it over powered so many per the reviews.  </li>
      <li>and I tend to be sensitive and headachey to strong scents.</li>
      <li>times\\&quot; trick if you need to make sure you are washing properly.  </li>

      <li>You are supposed to hold the middle ring on the dispenser while turning the pump (as you do with most hand soaps), but you can almost never hold that ring in place.  </li>

      <li>Once I advised him to make sure he is really washing his hands properly, the problem went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>actually smelled like old warm orange peels or something.</li>
      <li>The scent is kind of odd.  </li>
      <li>so I end up switching the one pump we were able open, and re-use it in a new bottle.  </li>
      <li>Ordered through Amazon which I really always order throught them if I can.</li>
      <li>Ingredients really do matter.  </li>
      <li>(She loves the scent as well!-- Very calming in my book) Still looking for candles with this scent..</li>
      <li>Cruelty free is a big issue for me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It wants to turn with the pump.  </li>
      <li>I almost hesitated because of that - too much of a scent.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the smell, I smelled too much sweet orange and barely any patchouli.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long a long time and looks good on my counter.</li>
      <li>Classic headache scent is lavender.</li>
      <li>The pump no longer pops up, forcing me to reuse an older pump.</li>
      <li>I have found if using cold water it doesn&#x27;t rinse well, but if using warm water it rinses off OK.</li>
      <li>and I expected a strong Mandarin orange smell.  </li>
      <li>was so excited to get this product although the smell is really strange.</li>
      <li>SO I generally save the ones that do and use them when a new bottle does not pump right.</li>
      <li>Kind of hard to get products out sometimes.</li>
      <li>Good plain hand washing go a long way.</li>
      <li>Patchouli is new to me, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  </li>
      <li>So if you are lucky enough to get a pump that you can easily open and actually pumps, consider yourself lucky and save it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The color of the soap is clear.</li>
      <li>Luckily the soap does last a long time</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I am so excited to find a product that smells lovely without artificial fragrances.  </li>
      <li>I have only used it few days now and so far not that strong.</li>
      <li>It is a thick soap so a small tap of pump is more than enough to clean hands.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bottom line for me is that I apparently don&#x27;t care for Patchouli.  </li>
      <li>but the scent is barely there.</li>
      <li>I guess, try if you like a non-antibacterial thick light scent hand soap.</li>
      <li>The first time it was in an open bag and ran over and ruined other items in the box.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought this was going to be really good. I was under-whelmed.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion there are much better products.&lt;br /&gt;I would not by this again.</li>
    <li> The scent is kind of odd.  Citrus with a hint of something else.  Its OK enough to use up the three pack, but I&#x27;d never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smells beauitiful and is clean and organic.  The only problem is the pump. Many of them don&#x27;t work....  SO I generally save the ones that do and use them when a new bottle does not pump right. I think the company could improve upon the design.  It is annoying.  The soap also comes in another scent that I like as well.  But because of the pump problems, I am considering looking elsewhere in the future.  So if you are lucky enough to get a pump that you can easily open and actually pumps, consider yourself lucky and save it.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  So this is a very mixed bag.</li>
    <li> I used to find these in local health food store, but they have since d/c the products and have their own brands, which I DO NOT LIKE. Thank you AMAZON . I did purchase several different combinations  LOVE  Them ALL</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers well. It&#x27;s a staple for us.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this soap!... and I tend to be sensitive and headachey to strong scents. It&#x27;s just yummy.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this soap.  It is nice and has no sulfates.. however, not one of the pumps worked. I had to pour it into another dispenser. Most of them leaked into the box it was packed in, losing some of the soap, then I lost soap after pouring it into a working dispenser..the soap is so thick I had to water it down to get it out of dispenser.  I do like the scent and it leaves me hands soft, but I would not reorder due to the above issues..</li>
    <li> what can I say? I love the combination of orange and patchouli and will go to great lengths to find them anywhere!  That being said, I bought the three and only gave one away for Christmas to my sister. (She loves the scent as well!-- Very calming in my book) Still looking for candles with this scent.. so my search continues!</li>
    <li> I like this soap. This is the second time I have ordered it. The first time it was in an open bag and ran over and ruined other items in the box. This time they can in a sealed plastic bag, so they only ran all over the inside of it. I didn&#x27;t bother to notify Amazon this time. I will wash off all the bottles and not order again. In checking, all three lids were not screwed on tightly. One was very loose. People comment on the soap not rinsing off their hands. I have found if using cold water it doesn&#x27;t rinse well, but if using warm water it rinses off OK. Liked the soap - hated the quality of the finished product.</li>
    <li> Parfum makes me sick, no matter how good it smells.  That&#x27;s why I am so excited to find a product that smells lovely without artificial fragrances.  I have actually bought extras of this hand soap to put in my friends&#x27; bathrooms.  They all love it as well!</li>
    <li> This hand soap has one of the most wonderful scents.  I will be buying more when I run out.  Just so original.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the scent of the product be way to strong for me (sorry about that English there) as some scent are.  I have only used it few days now and so far not that strong. There are plenty of BB&amp;W scents that are stronger.  I bought for husband because of Patchouli but to my knowledge he hasn&#x27;t used it or commented.  It is a thick soap so a small tap of pump is more than enough to clean hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is not \\&quot;antibacterial\\&quot; only because everything now days is and we are in over kill.  Good plain hand washing go a long way. Due to the cost I will have to weigh if this is something we will continue to buy.  I like mandarin orange but the scent is barely there. I think I expected more since it over powered so many per the reviews.  I almost hesitated because of that - too much of a scent. It gives me a headache at times even light parfums (of scent that I love). Classic headache scent is lavender. Suppose to ease but gives me an instant one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess, try if you like a non-antibacterial thick light scent hand soap. I am not sure if it is just our batch. I gave one to my son. Will check on their feedback.  I will decide based on whether my husband likes it. He loves B&amp;BW Jasmine (sensual) - not full name. To me those scents are a wee bit strong.</li>
    <li> This hand soap cleans well, though I am personally not fond of the frangrance.  I was hoping the Mandarin orange fragrance would be the dominant aroma.  Patchouli is new to me, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  The reviews written by others were very good and I expected a strong Mandarin orange smell.  The bottom line for me is that I apparently don&#x27;t care for Patchouli.  But as a hand cleanser, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> First time I tried this soap was at my acupunturist office loved the smell made me feel good.  Citrus always makes you feel good when you smell it, also Patchouli.  would recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product. Ordered through Amazon which I really always order throught them if I can.</li>
    <li> Nice hand soap that isn&#x27;t too overpowering with the scent. One star taken away for the pump. Kind of hard to get products out sometimes. Other than that, no complaints!</li>
    <li> Love this pretty hand soap! Smells good, too!</li>
    <li> My wife is a nurse and I work in the medical field so we wash our hands often.  Needless to say, it can be super drying!  At home we wanted something much more gentle and this stuff really fits the bill!  It smells great and looks good on the counter.  As far as the one star poster talking about a film on the hands, we have never experienced it.  In conclusion, we feel this is great stuff, that is why we are back for the three pack!</li>
    <li> Love the soap and buy it frequently, but it is virtually impossible to start the pump going--so I end up switching the one pump we were able open, and re-use it in a new bottle.  Any hints on how to get the pump started?</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the patchouli smells musty and the pump doesn&#x27;t bounce back up after you push it down. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> was so excited to get this product although the smell is really strange. I love patchouli but this didn&#x27;t smell like that to me actually smelled like old warm orange peels or something.</li>
    <li> This soap smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this product and it really smells very nice.  It lasts a long a long time and looks good on my counter.</li>
    <li> I use this in all our bathrooms for hand soap.  Several family members and visitors have mentioned they love the soap.  It doesn&#x27;t dry our hands out either.</li>
    <li> I can say after using this hand soap exclusively for about a year that I absolutely love it and I notice my hands are less dry than they used to be when I used other national brand soaps.  Ingredients really do matter.  Cruelty free is a big issue for me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that you need to make sure you wash your hands properly when you use this soap.  By properly, I mean to really work the soap up to a lather and spend a little bit of time really washing your hands, the way you are supposed to.  Try the old \\&quot;sing happy birthday 3 times\\&quot; trick if you need to make sure you are washing properly.  If you do this, you will not have the issue another reviewer claims to have had with film being left behind.  My husband complained about this for a long time, including how it would get stuck under his wedding ring.  Once I advised him to make sure he is really washing his hands properly, the problem went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, and the reason for removing a star, is these things are impossible to open.  You are supposed to hold the middle ring on the dispenser while turning the pump (as you do with most hand soaps), but you can almost never hold that ring in place.  It wants to turn with the pump.  The only way I can do it is to hold the middle ring with a pair of pliers and turn the pump with the other hand.  So I have to keep a pair of pliers handy in both spots. Luckily the soap does last a long time so it&#x27;s only every 3-4 months I need to open one.  But every time I groan.  Really bad design on the dispenser.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product.  Works great on the hands!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to use any other soap. I love everything about it: the smell, the feel, the consistency, the look and its overall efficiency. Once I discovered it years ago, I have never used anything else</li>
    <li> The project was received on time so I have no complaints there.  I didn&#x27;t care for the smell, I smelled too much sweet orange and barely any patchouli.</li>
    <li> Does not smell good and pumps don&#x27;t work well.  Save your money and get something pretty smelling with a good pump on it.</li>
    <li> The product has an amazing scent! As I wash my hands it fills the room and takes me to a happy place by an ocean side in some southern country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap produces adequate leather with out being too astringent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of the soap is clear.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, nice orange smell</li>
    <li> Great smelling and cleans well. Just a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years and I love it, but I hate the packing. The pump no longer pops up, forcing me to reuse an older pump. Also, the pumps are often broken leaving a piece of plastic in the bottle. Finally, the last 3 shipments all arrived with the lids loose and soap all over the box. While Amazon did replace them, I am tired of requesting a replacement every time I order this soap. I will no longer buy this item, or any other soap from Nature&#x27;s Gate.</li>
