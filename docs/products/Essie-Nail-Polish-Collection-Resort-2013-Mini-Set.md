      <li>I love that the colors are so cool and unique!</li>
      <li>I bought this for the blue, in hopes that it was as bright as I wanted!</li>

      <li>I love my new Essie nail polish and the colors look amazing on everyone.</li>

      <li>These colors are so fun for summer.</li>
      <li>and will more than likely buy the full size versions of them as well.</li>
      <li>and this collection is a great gift set because there are four small bottles.</li>
      <li>The polishes themselves are very vibrant, not necessary something i would have picked it on my own</li>
      <li>colours are true  and vibrant does not chip....</li>
      <li>I even tried with a top coat and without, and got the same results both times.  </li>
      <li>In the Cab-ana is more blue than Where&#x27;s My Chauffeur.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you, I LOVE THE BLUE even more than I expected.</li>
      <li>I can go buy a large bottle.</li>
      <li>I think the pink will only go on my toes, its a bit to bright for my taste on the nails, still pretty though.</li>
      <li>The Essie nail polish collection resort 2013 mini set is really</li>
      <li>The colors look better and wear longer than expected.</li>
      <li>then if I really like the color (and I did)</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to spend this much, but a full-size of</li>
      <li>The smaller bottles are perfect if you are not sure if you like the colors, then you can buy the bigger bottles if you want.</li>
      <li>I just wish the blue was a teeny tiny bit more neon-teal than light blue.</li>
      <li>The coral is not very unique, but the other three shades are great additions to my collection.</li>
      <li>The bottle color is beautiful, but something really weird happened with the formula.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I liked having the small bottles to sample</li>
      <li>Shipped fast &amp; the quality looked like new.</li>
      <li>But I use a great base and top coat, so that solves the problem.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> All the colors in this collection are so bright and beautiful!! Shipped fast &amp; the quality looked like new. Come here! is a bright coral more on the orange side than pink. First timer is a gorgeous pastel green and blends flawless w/ turquoise &amp; caicos. In absolutely love in the cab-ana and under where? and will more than likely buy the full size versions of them as well. My only problem was that the mini polishes are less than half the size of the full size bottles but half the price. I&#x27;m not complaining, just saying it&#x27;s not really a deal although it is very affordable. If you&#x27;re looking to sample this collection though, this is indeed the way to go!</li>
    <li> good quality, good size. i liked all the colors, and though I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet, the ones I have used have a great quality</li>
    <li> I love my new Essie nail polish and the colors look amazing on everyone. I use these bright bold colors to broadcast my personality and give a kick to my wardrobe!</li>
    <li> great price and value just when you need those in season  colours  all for the price of one nailpolish... colours are true  and vibrant does not chip....love this mini set</li>
    <li> Colors were as expected. However, the blue and coral colors stained my nails. Really glad I got the minis! In the cabana is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Love Essie nail polish and these shades are wonderful. I like the fact I could get them in the mini sizes so I can actually use them up.</li>
    <li> The Essie nail polish collection resort 2013 mini set is really great.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are so nice and in style</li>
    <li> I love the colors except you need to do 2-3 layers and top coat or it will not look shiny</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. very Nice colors - picture true to hue. Compact and cute. Great for stocking stuffers or on their own.</li>
    <li> The polishes themselves are very vibrant, not necessary something i would have picked it on my own but what got me mad is that the polish tops broke off.</li>
    <li> My favorite colors are in the package. Essie did a great job with all 4 and they were perfect summer colors. I can&#x27;t wait to try their winter 2013</li>
    <li> The colors were great. It&#x27;s nice that you can buy the variety packs because the large bottles are expensive and being geared toward young girls they change colors a lot.</li>
    <li> this had great color, just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Loved these little guys for quick summer manicures!  It&#x27;s fun to try out colors without committing to a big bottle!</li>
    <li> This is a great set - both on color and value. I never use full bottles of polish and these minis are just perfect. I love the colors in this set a ton. I just wish the blue was a teeny tiny bit more neon-teal than light blue. But no matter. I still love it. The only reason I gave it one less star than perfection is that I do notice the paint seems to chip a but faster than some of my other Essies. Not sure if it&#x27;s age, or from shipping. But I use a great base and top coat, so that solves the problem. Gotta do the package deal. Great value on this set overall.</li>
    <li> These shades are fantastic. They are Essie quality, which means you get a big bang for your buck! You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> these colors are great and i love the smaller size bottles! I am loyal to essie. Highly recommended product. :)</li>
    <li> great nail polish gift for christmas</li>
    <li> I liked all the colors but the purple is REALLY Easterish. The bottles are super tiny but the polish lasts as long as OPI.</li>
    <li> The quality of this polish was good bit the colors are so dark and not at all like the picture.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to a niece.  I thought this would be a fun collection of summery colors for her to use.  When it showed up, I actually had a long mental battle over giving it up.  These colors are absolutely adorable.  It&#x27;s a fun, bright variety.  Additionally, I love the small bottles.  They allow you a chance to enjoy a color several times and have variety, without getting bored or hanging on to a bottle so long that it gets dried up or goopy.</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied for paying so much for tiny bottles of Essie nail polish and it only staying on for a couple of days. I applied basecoat and top coat and it started chipping 2 days later, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing! In the Cab-ana is more blue than Where&#x27;s My Chauffeur. It stands out so well and looked amazing on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I had troubles with the other colors. The brush to Under Where? was bent, making it extremely difficult to pain. The color and finish were as beautiful as the swatches.&lt;br /&gt;First Timer was a night-mare! When I used OPI clear topcoat, it turned yellow-green! It looked terrible! I couldn&#x27;t remove it because I painted acrylic nails and had to wait a week until they fell off. The bottle color is beautiful, but something really weird happened with the formula.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried Come Here! When I got the package, it appeared to have been opened.&lt;br /&gt;The prices have dropped since I purchased this, but overall, I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s a bad value for the money. If you&#x27;re going to spend this much, but a full-size of either In the Cab-ana or Under Where? They are very unique and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I like the colors and they have good coverage on one coat.&lt;br /&gt;Problem is they dry up pretty fast because the bottles are so tiny.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never mini again. Good collection though</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous, but they chip real easily, I&#x27;ve had the entire color just chip off my nail within hours.</li>
    <li> Would probably buy them in the full size next time, but it was also nice being able to sample the colors and see what I liked and didn&#x27;t... The in the cabana is way cool!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the blue, in hopes that it was as bright as I wanted! Let me tell you, I LOVE THE BLUE even more than I expected. The green and purple are gorge also. I think the pink will only go on my toes, its a bit to bright for my taste on the nails, still pretty though. These are colors I will need to buy the full size of bc I love them that much for spring/summer. My package arrived in good timing and there were zero damages :)</li>
    <li> I love these 4 piece mini cubes!  The colors in the cube are great.  The coral is not very unique, but the other three shades are great additions to my collection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always admired Essie products, hence the reason why I bought this with 4 colors. Unfortunately, I thought the bottles would be bigger, or at least normal size... this may not last me too long.</li>
    <li> Great price for a sample size of Essie. A regular bottle of Essie is about $8 and this collection is a great gift set because there are four small bottles. Nothing was wrong with the product when I received it. And shipping was on time.</li>
    <li> it was what i expected it to be and the colors are great! i love the blue and green, especially. haven&#x27;t tried out the other two yet, though.</li>
    <li> Love these four colors separately or color blocked! The colors look better and wear longer than expected. Used with Essie base and top coats.</li>
    <li> May Hauer-Simmonds said: Love this collection! Is amazing! I love that the colors are so cool and unique! My favorite is in the cabana! perfect aqua color!</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES the blue and green shades.  They go with so many of her outfits, as well.  I like that the containers are small.  Nail polish goes bad so quickly, you might as well have small bottles!</li>
    <li> The nail polish is beautiful when its on the nails.  The colors are close to the box colors but are way brighter.  But I used a base coat (same that I always do) and it had chipped the next day.  I got about 24 hours with out any chips.  Then I got to about 48 hours and I needed to take it off cause I had chipped more than I could tolerate. I even tried with a top coat and without, and got the same results both times.  For this product being so expensive I think I would spend the extra $1.50 and get OPI.</li>
    <li> Essie continues to put out the neatest colors in their polishes, which always go on smoothly, dry fast and resist chipping.  Can&#x27;t wait to try all 4 of these.</li>
    <li> Came on time, I loved all of the colors and the mini size was perfect.  I love these nail polishes</li>
    <li> I love these colors! The smaller bottles are perfect if you are not sure if you like the colors, then you can buy the bigger bottles if you want.</li>
    <li> These colors are so fun for summer. I liked having the small bottles to sample then if I really like the color (and I did) I can go buy a large bottle.</li>
    <li> These were very thick and chipped the same day. Tried various top coats and still got chips either the same day or the next day. Great colors though.</li>
    <li> I love Essie nail polishes. They are priced right, long wearing (especially on toes), great color saturation and are three free ! I really like the mini collections that way they don&#x27;t dry up and I can get new colors for next the next season.</li>
    <li> Excellent products! I have tried many other brand names on a regular basis but i always go back to Essie. I love the colors!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the size of the bottles is perfect. The colors are perfect for spring/summer. The red is like a neon coral color I&#x27;ve never seen before and looks gorgeous on my olive skin.</li>
    <li> So I received my box of polish and the bottles were opened and chipped and the box was mangled. It looked like it fell off a truck, run over by 10 cars and shredded by a dog by the time it got to me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever finished a bottle of nail polish. I usually use it a few times, then forget about it and it dries out. This is a perfect size to try out all the trendiest colors for summer, without wasting a whole bottle. Love!</li>
