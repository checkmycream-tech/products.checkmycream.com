      <li>me get this right now!!!</li>
      <li>This stuff is just amazing girls love it</li>
      <li>This product sold by Amerifume looks identical to my old bottle but lasts 5hr&#x27;s at best on my skin and by the time 4-5 hrs has reached, the scent is non existant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake?</li>
      <li>As far as the smell... best i&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
      <li>I currently own 6 bottles of Creed and just ordered 2 more.</li>
      <li>In essence: If I were trying to make a useful impression without overstaying my welcome in any walk of life, I&#x27;d wear this stuff on that occasion.</li>
      <li>Just be aware that it is in their best interest to get you to buy from them at the full retail price.</li>
      <li>Just be aware that it is in their best interest to get you to buy from them at the full retail price.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this cologne at full price from retail stores and loved it.</li>
      <li>I am a confident gentleman -</li>
      <li>I get more attention when I use my CK Eternity or Obsessions.</li>
      <li>I did a test spray on my arm and could not smell it more than 6 inches away</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance , I always used but what I do love more is the price from Amazon</li>
      <li>but I love the fragrance but not their price .thanks</li>
      <li>This is 100% authentic.</li>
      <li>Better to have both in your collection</li>
      <li>But, it reminds me of one of the many dime store colognes I would find on my brother&#x27;s dresser about 15 years ago.</li>
      <li>this and imperial are my two favorite creed scents.  </li>
      <li>and I purchase Creed with confidence knowing I will enjoy their proudcts!</li>
      <li>My all time favorite.</li>
      <li>Their customer service is outstanding.</li>
      <li>above\\&quot; most colognes for men out there.  </li>
      <li>and it lasts over 8 hours, so don&#x27;t spray more than two or three times or you&#x27;ll be giving yourself a headache</li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>Great cologne, and the real deal.  </li>
      <li>Outstanding smell.</li>
      <li>For sure, I&#x27;ll be buying more of it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it and purchase from Beauty Encounter is authentic from The Dubai Mall in UAE.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance</li>
      <li>Upon receiving it, I found that it is 100% genuine!</li>
      <li>, what is that scent your wearing\\&quot; on more than one occasion.  </li>
      <li>I notice that it lasts about 6 hours on me with about two sprays, and with any more that number increases to about 12 hours.  </li>
      <li>I am a woman who loves men&#x27;s cologne better than fruity or overly floral women&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite fragrances.</li>
      <li>I am glad I purchased GTI since I&#x27;m into fragrance collecting.</li>
      <li>The best value is with the larger bottle.  </li>
      <li>If that occasion is every day, all the better.</li>
      <li>is my all time favorite brand.</li>
      <li>Additionally, I would also suggest that GIT is best suited for a more mature audience (35+) - those that will appreciate the true beauty of this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>However, the smell is pretty good too.  </li>
      <li>It does smell like cool water which I also own</li>
      <li>This way you will know exactly which CREED scent works best for your particular chemistry.  </li>
      <li>This way you will know exactly which CREED scent works best for your particular chemistry.  </li>
      <li>A greatly unique scent!</li>
      <li>and I strongly believe it&#x27;s authentic based on its packaging, and quality.</li>
      <li>34;too good to be true&amp;#34; certainly applies here.</li>
      <li>Of course one has to check any particular scent  with one&#x27;s own chemistry; but that said I find this stuff to be in a league of its own for men.</li>
      <li>It does have very good lasting ability on the skin, too.</li>
      <li>Very true here.  </li>
      <li>Then again, buying from a genuine Creed boutique is not a bad idea and saves you the hassle of fakes if you have that kind of cash to spend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I felt that is was a refined and more sophisticated version of Cool Water.</li>
      <li>I was really expecting a lot and after a month of good use this has been a disappointment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>all over the world, quite simply, THEY HAVE EARNED the right to be called the best through their reputation of providing the most luxurious and incredibly well thought out scents in the entire world.  </li>

      <li>Very good when it first came in the mail I was not to sure about how it would mix with my natural state</li>
      <li>Cool water smells too synthetic for my taste!</li>
      <li>, one spray lasts for 6 to 8 hours easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t care what anyone says. This is 100% authentic. I know exactly how GIT smells like. I would know if it was fake. It does smell like cool water which I also own but it is definitely higher quality and more refined. You will enjoy the smell of this particular fragrance a lot more than cool water. However, people most people won&#x27;t be able to tell you are not wearing cool water :( I think this fragrance was supposed to be sold in Dubai.... Somehow it&#x27;s being sold on Amazon for a discounted price . I am glad I purchased GTI since I&#x27;m into fragrance collecting. To me, it&#x27;s worth the money but definitely look into cool water because they almost smell identical. Cool water smells too synthetic for my taste! I hope I helped some people.</li>
    <li> I am really disapointed $130 cologne is so light and does not last. I expected the quality of Creed Silver Mt. Water which I use regularly. I guess if you perfer a very faint scent, this is the stuff for you. I would no have purchased this if I had known what I know now. If you want to drop a C note on cologne, get the Creed Silver Mt. Water. Smell great and lasts from sunrise to bedtime.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is really nice. You only need a couple sprays at most to get the full effect. My husband over did it one day, and we learned our lesson, haha. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I took this bottle bough from amazon, sold by amazon for $139. untill amazon gets a new supply selling for close to $200 don&#x27;t buy. Here is what was told to me ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this two starts, because it fooled many, its just such a good fake. Look the bottle is almost exactly the same, Just no serial number, the problem is old bottles did not have a serial number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem is that this says Toilet Water, and that&#x27;s what it is, Creed never makes toilet water, it makes eau de Parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also there hasn&#x27;t been any real box done for Green Irish tweed that is 4.0 OZ that is not GOLD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the biggest problem is this does not last. The smell is almost a perfect copy, even the person who has been working for creed for 9 years, said this smelled like a very good copy.&lt;br /&gt;Creed never lasts long, but his one only lasts 5-10 minutes not hours, minutes&lt;br /&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is killing me though, and made it really hard for the creed store manger, is that A long Long time ago, they did make eau de toilet, if that is true, then this might just be an old bottle, its just hard to tell what i know is it does not last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What i know si that Amazon does not Sell Fakes, I have bought over 30 colognes, they were all real, so this one is deff something very hard to tell</li>
    <li> Be very careful. My Creed may be fake. I cannot find batch number on the box.</li>
    <li> A subtle, soft and pleasing, but deceptively longer lasting scent that is masculine while never overwhelming (or even announcing) one&#x27;s presence (nor anyone else&#x27;s).  It is a gentle scent though it could never be mistaken for feminine, it speaks of quiet confidence.  It appears to dissipate quickly, but this is deceptive, as the gentle linger, even on clothing, lasts throughout the day.  This is the single most pleasing men&#x27;s scent I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  The best value is with the larger bottle.  Wonderful cologne.</li>
    <li> Well I blind bought this cologne from all the recommendations of my buddies. I have had it for almost a year and the only thing i can tell you is that this bottle is worth of $150 or however it is now. Some people say it smells like Cool water, yes indeed it does since the creator of cool water copied GIT, but when it settled down, GIT is way way way better than Cool water. It is a cologne that would make people turn their heads and ask what is that good smell...Creed GIT &#x3D; one of the best.</li>
    <li> I am a great fan of Irish Tweed, this time I tried it from Amazon due to low price but bad luck ... I got a fake one looks exacty like original but smells fake and not lasts long..I suggest to buy this from CREEDBOUTIQUE.COM if you want original one..</li>
    <li> Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed is the best gentleman&#x27;s  fragrance made.  It represents class, confidence, and simply put - a gentleman..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About six (6) months ago I made a decision to venture into niche fragrances.  Up to that point, I had already amassed  a vast collection of designer fragrances and a few &amp;#34;hybrids&amp;#34; or borderline niche, i.e. Tom Ford&#x27;s Noir and Grey Vetiver, but no true niche fragrances.  I purchased two (2) Creed fragrances and three (3) Bond No 9 fragrances at the Nordstom&#x27;s in Nashville. Green Irish Tweed was the first purchased.  There is something magical about holding that bottle in your hand the first time... (for those who own this fragrance know what I mean..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the bottle, you get a heavy dose (and the Creed nozzles are one of a kind) of the beautiful blend of floral, herbal, and woodsy notes with minimal change during the drydown.  A truly one-of-a-kind fragrance that cannot be compared to any other fragrance - yes, there are similarities to other fragrances, but really, there is no substitute nor comparison to GIT.  I find that I get 8+ hours longevity from GIT, but close projection/sillage, just beyond arms length for about 4-6 hours.  The &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34; is amazing - every time I have worn this fragrance I have received compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While GIT offers fantastic flexibility - can be worn during any season, for any event, and day or night - I would pitch that it is not an everyday scent.  I am a confident gentleman - when I apply GIT on for those special occasions, the Superman comes out.  It is a new me.  Additionally, I would also suggest that GIT is best suited for a more mature audience (35+) - those that will appreciate the true beauty of this fragrance.  The younger crowd may disagree, but when you get to be my age (and established), you will understand and agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottling and packaging are first class - what is the old expression, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for..&amp;#34;.  Very true here.  The price/value on the surface is not good - but can you place a value on creating a more confident and a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; you..??  I have no regrets making the purchase at a department store and paying full retail price.  I have since discovered several options (and reliable/trustworthy) on eBay that have cut the cost of subsequent Creed purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I highly recommend adding Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed to any collection.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed and I think you will like the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; you once you wear it.  Unleash the &amp;#34;Superman&amp;#34; in you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Green Irish Tweed is 5 stars out of 5 stars.  The first and only time I have given a perfect score.  GIT is perfection..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count... Invest your time rather than wasting your time...true here.

    <li> Sadly this is fake. I did not look at the reviews before ordering and it arrived recently. The smell is nothing like Green Irish Tweed and does not last long. It feels like they filled a bottle with water and shipped it. Either that or it is a very old product</li>
    <li> Great fragrance! Totally loved it!</li>
    <li> Just simply stunning cologne !!&lt;br /&gt;MY3RD PURCHASE OVER 50% OFF RETAIL STUNNING.&lt;br /&gt;LAST ALL DAY. EVEN THOE I SMOKE IT SMELLS EVEN SEXIER WITH THE MIX OF TOBACCO</li>
    <li> Fake, not the real deal. Stop selling this and stealing people&#x27;s money. I know real Creed and this isn&#x27;t it!</li>
    <li> Very pricey at first glance, this purchase was a huge splurge for me, and I don&#x27;t regret it in the slightest.  A 4-oz bottle of cologne will last someone who uses it every other day for about 4 years, so the value is significant.  Green Irish Tweed (like all of Creed&#x27;s fragrances) shares a very high sillage rate with other top-quality perfumers like Tom Ford, BVLGARI, and Knize.  I notice that it lasts about 6 hours on me with about two sprays, and with any more that number increases to about 12 hours.  A very fresh scent, somewhat reminiscent of Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water with aqua notes, citrusy lemon verbena, and a very subtle cedar base note.  Green Irish Tweed gives the impression of modern sophistication with a nod toward tradition, which I think makes it suitable for men aged 25-45.  An A+ fragrance, GIT has truly become my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I liked Green Irish Creed. The only problem is it&#x27;s not long lasting as compared to the other perfume&lt;br /&gt;named \\&quot;houbigant\\&quot; that I used. But for the time lasts it smells really good.</li>
    <li> save the 150 bucks and buy the real one.. smell goes away after 5 minutes.... very dissapointed. was not expecting this at all</li>
    <li> While this cologne for men is very pricey, far too expensive for some people to even consider, I personally really like this cologne.  I could almost use this as my &#x27;daily&#x27; wear cologne, but the price for me, prevents that from happening.  It is by far one of my all time favorite colognes for men.  I personally change my wear of cologne on a daily basis.  I really don&#x27;t have a \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot; or anything that I wear daily.  I don&#x27;t know why, but I have always been the type of person to change what I wear, every single day.  I guess I just want something different.  Just like not wearing the same clothes everyday, I also don&#x27;t wear the same cologne everyday.  I change cologne daily like I change my clothes.  Also, it depends on what mood I am in.  Green Irish Tweed to me can be worn any time of the day and for any occasion.  Daily wear to work, business venture, impress your wife or significant other, it really doesn&#x27;t matter, Green Irish Tweed from CREED will work in any and all situations or occasions.  It has a very distinguished appeal to this scent in my opinion.  Very refined and makes you feel like a rich, suave, gentleman in my opinion.  You WILL get compliments when wearing Green Irish Tweed from both young and old persons of the opposite sex, I assure you.  I personally have gotten a lot of complements and \\&quot;hey, what is that scent your wearing\\&quot; on more than one occasion.  The only thing I can say, if your considering purchasing this whether for yourself (which I highly recommend) or as a gift for someone else (again, which I highly recommend) spend the extra money and BUY THIS!  It is worth every single penny above the normal \\&quot;mass market\\&quot; brands and this is a cologne that you, your husband, significant other, or friend will cherish and enjoy for the remainder of their lives.  CREED is a brand a \\&quot;notch above\\&quot; most colognes for men out there.  I have tried literally thousands of different scents out there, and I personally own hundreds of different scents, CREED is my all time favorite brand. Not just Green Irish Tweed, which is, my favorite of their brand, but I love several other scents CREED makes for men and women as well. They are expensive, no doubt, but once you experience CREED, you will know why.  They don&#x27;t skimp on anything and they utilize only the finest ingredients in their colognes (for both men and women).  There is a reason that CREED is the supplier of royalty and other distinguished persons (including Presidents and rulers of various nations) all over the world, quite simply, THEY HAVE EARNED the right to be called the best through their reputation of providing the most luxurious and incredibly well thought out scents in the entire world.  There may be more expensive scents out there in the world, but, there is no better, PERIOD.  Do yourself a favor, at least one time in your life, buy a scent from CREED and ENJOY!  (One recomendation I do have for you.  Buy samples of CREED scents FIRST, that way you can experience what the scents are like on your skin.  This way you will know exactly which CREED scent works best for your particular chemistry.  Sometimes what smells great in a bottle, doesn&#x27;t smell so great on you.  On the other hand, sometimes when you smell it in a bottle, then spray on your skin, after it cools down on your skin and softens a bit, it smells absolutely incredible on your skin.  TRY SAMPLES ON YOUR SKIN first, before purchasing.  That way when you do spend $170 to $500 a BOTTLE!, Yes, I told you CREED is expensive, it is then worth every penny you have spent).CREED is my all time favorite brand.

    <li> This is one of my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite fragrances. He was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have used House of Creed Eau-de Toilette and other products from this fine old company for some years now.  But the veracity of Amazon as a authorized seller or re-seller seems very troubling. Specifically, I question the authenticity and origin / source of Amazons supplier. For a product made in France for centuries it seems very odd the there is a label on the bottom of the bottle itself in Arabic script. A bottle Creed Green Irish Tweed would normally retail at $270.00(us),even with an amazing discount, it seems difficult to believe that AMAZON could be selling new,fresh stock for $139.67, and possibly make a profit.  I believe what we are all buying is old, liquidated, foreign export stock. What is that old adage,\\&quot; If it seems too good to be true it probably is\\&quot;.  Such a shame on Amazon, and it seems a gullible shame on me for trying to save a dollar This is the last time for me!</li>
    <li> I wish this cologne would last as long as the Aventus.  However, the smell is pretty good too.  The price is very reasonable compared to department store and I strongly believe it&#x27;s authentic based on its packaging, and quality.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited to try this cologne as it was my very first very expensive cologne I have purchased. I was really expecting a lot and after a month of good use this has been a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell great right from the first spray...but its last maybe an hour tops. The bottle leaks and I haven&#x27;t received any compliments when I wear it. I get more attention when I use my CK Eternity or Obsessions.</li>
    <li> I went back and forth after reading mixed reviews about if what you get is the real thing or not. That is the reason I went directly through Amazon and not a third party seller. This stuff  is hands down the best attention grabber of any cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned. It literally stops women in their tracks to inquire about it and smell me. I highly recommend GIT, but make sure to go directly through Amazon as I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m sure about other sellers.</li>
    <li> Perfect gif for my husband thank you so much!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and it smells great.  We were at a cirque show a couple years ago and my hubby was wearing Green Irish Tweed...at the end of the show the man sitting next to him, (a guy in his twenties with his girlfriend), actually asked my hubby what kind of cologne her was wearing and told him he smelled great!  Yeah, its that good</li>
    <li> Smells great. Came packaged as described. Awesome getting this for half the price of a major retailer. If it&#x27;s old, I can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> This one is either FAKE or very old, it do not last beyond 1 or 2 hours i can feel difference between lasting this one and few others which i bought from Macys</li>
    <li> This is a very well done cologne by Creed, their signature fragrance.  It combines notes of smoke and sweetness without being at all cloying or heavy.  My friend and I are somewhat surprised by how rather light it is.  Additionally, it may improve in the bottle, as you continue to use it...  I would say definitely a first class cologne, and even above such fine fragrances as the RPL line, and Dolce and Gabbana.  But is it worth the price?  It does have very good lasting ability on the skin, too. (...)  And concerning the &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; question: I doubt it generally, but that the sellers may be purchasing it second hand (such as left-over stock).  As a general rule, this should work out all right.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. I was skeptical but it matches my bottle purchased from NM and at a fraction of the price. I&#x27;ll buy again on my other favorite fragrances.</li>
    <li> Excellent deal Thank you</li>
    <li> Great cologne, and the real deal.  I bought from Amazon.com directly, i.e. sold and shipped by.  Mine had two inserts, one the standard House of Creed cardboard propaganda, and the other a folding liner written in Arabic.  Smells amazing, no different from the bottle you&#x27;d buy at the department store.  I have no quarrels with Amazon gobbling up units from the Eastern market for sale in the US... I just saved half of what I would have paid anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Bought this for friend as a gift,it&#x27;s the only perfume he would use. I found it on Amazon for a decent price so I purchased it for him.</li>
    <li> i am guessing that some  up scale Arab shop went threw there inventory and put this item in a box .then sold it to amazon i had purchased a smaller bottle from norstrom prior , and comparing the 2 my bottle did not come with Arabic writing inside the box,and seamed to last a lot  longer mind ya they are booth the edp millesec,maybe they removed this item from there shelf after a period of time, and not to loose profit drop, it back on the  market to make a few bucks rather then destroy it if the price came down it makes a good toilet water i contacted creed ,and received a prompt call back. amazon is not a authorized seller of there product !and i was told that my guess was probably dead on!! shame on amazon for raking in such amount for this item considering its probably a 3 rd of the strength never again  buyer beware</li>
    <li> Soft cedar and spicy scent which is 180 degrees from the cheap trash stuff sold under &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; labels.&lt;br /&gt;This has been around for over 100 years .... and I&#x27;ve been wearing a drop of it every day for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;Subtle ... and incredibly expensive, but a bottle lasts me 2 years.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A FAKE BOTTLE !!!&lt;br /&gt;THE SCENT WEARS OFF AFTER A FEW MINUTES&lt;br /&gt;THE CAP DOES NOT FIT CORRECLTY!!</li>
    <li> I live in an area that only allows me to order this product online. Upon receiving it, I found that it is 100% genuine! Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Its Cool Water packaged for all the rich snobs. Dont buy this. I am a cologne connoisseur and I know my s^^*. Dont waste your money on this when Cool Water is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading through the reviews as well as some recommendations on the internet. To me, the scent was okay to me at most, but that is not the disappointing part because different people have different preference, and I am not writing this review because of that. What disappointed me is how little time the scent can last. I do not think it could last more than an hour! Also the cap is very loose as if it could fall out at any time if you put it in your traveling bag.</li>
    <li> I blind bought this cologne b/c of all the hype surrounding it. It was put on a very high pedestal and I had to climb on my tippy toes just to reach for the bottle. It comes in a matte black bottle which feels pretty substantial. The box is eggshell white with raised CREED lettering (much like the business cards from American Psycho), and a green felt name placard. This bottle is luxurious indeed. The juice inside smells like wet, green hillside on a cool, cloudy morning. It smells very natural and IMHO doesn&#x27;t smell much like Cool Water, as it is often compared to and vice versa. It smells much deeper and much greener. The longevity for an Eau De Parfum is lacking. I get around 5 hours or so with GIT. The projection is pretty strong at first and the smell is very nice. This could be worn for any occasion or time of year.</li>
    <li> It was what i expected</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> The product I received was either old or fake. I did a test spray on my arm and could not smell it more than 6 inches away and it was gone within an hour. I tried to return it but it is not returnable. The only reason I gave 2 stars is Amazon processed a refund without returning it.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance , I always used but what I do love more is the price from Amazon I used to buy my Creed Green Irish Tweed on Neiman Marcus and Sacks of Fith Av but I love the fragrance but not their price .thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> This is a fake. As an EDP it doesn&#x27;t even last 5 minutes. I&#x27;ve bought GIT from the Creed boutique before and it doesn&#x27;t smell quite like it; the real GIT lasts for a very long time. If you really want to try this scent, you are likely going to have to pay full price for it. Avoid this purchase - there&#x27;s no refunds for fake parfums.</li>
    <li> the real deal!! make sure you get from amazon directly,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have much to say about this.  If you like a good modern casual cologne, get this.  Its 4oz, you only need about 1 spray vs the cheap colognes where you need 2-3 so if you think about it.. you are saving money and getting a higher quality cologne for you.  As far as the smell... best i&#x27;ve ever had.  It got me laid in puerto rico and i&#x27;m not lieing.</li>
    <li> This was not and original creed item.&lt;br /&gt;Item is a fake. A little disappointed in amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I will only be purchasing creed from an authorized dealer from now on.&lt;br /&gt;The old saying of &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; certainly applies here.</li>
    <li> First: I still like the smell!&lt;br /&gt;Second: I agree with the other 1-2 star reviewers, that it is hard to believe that this is an original.&lt;br /&gt;I used the perfume years ago and it really lasted the whole day, \\&quot;delivering\\&quot; compliments not only from my wife;-). As it is really expensive, I stopped using it for some years. Now, being in the US, I searched for it again and gave it a try, as I couldn&#x27;t imagine to get a \\&quot;fake\\&quot;. But most likely I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be careful and try to get and original GIT in a perfumery, where you can test it for one day;-)&lt;br /&gt;Again it used to be a fantastic smell!!!</li>
    <li> Let me preface this by saying I can&#x27;t speak as to the fragrance from the retailer. I don&#x27;t know how it smells. The fragrance I ordered from Amazon came with the tell-tale &amp;#34;Arabic writing&amp;#34; at the bottom of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I primed the little pump by pressing it a few times and got a large area of my skin. Initially, the scent is very, very strong out of the bottle, which then slowly subsides. It does have that &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; fresh smell and it lasts over 8 hours, so don&#x27;t spray more than two or three times or you&#x27;ll be giving yourself a headache hahah. I rather like it and wear it every day to the office. For sure, I&#x27;ll be buying more of it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore a jacket and the scent stuck to it for days!</li>
    <li> Love it and purchase from Beauty Encounter is authentic from The Dubai Mall in UAE.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s far and away favorite. I take that seriously not just because..., but she&#x27;s pretty savvy and she also worked in fragrances for a long time. Of course one has to check any particular scent  with one&#x27;s own chemistry; but that said I find this stuff to be in a league of its own for men. The backstory is interesting too, but it doesn&#x27;t sell itself the wrong way around. Cary Grant had good taste, and this is an elegant company. In essence: If I were trying to make a useful impression without overstaying my welcome in any walk of life, I&#x27;d wear this stuff on that occasion. If that occasion is every day, all the better.</li>
    <li> I could still smell faint traces of it, 12 hours after putting it on.</li>
    <li> I did use \\&quot;Green Irish Tweed\\&quot; by Creed for few years. The bottle that I did buy and send direct from Amazon is the worst I ever buy. Is fake is not original. The box is mark with Arab letters and the bottle has a little sticker on the bottom in Arab letters too. I never seen before such thing to original Creed I did buy from Neiman Marcus store. The major problem for this bottle of Eau de perfume is does not last the smell even one hour and can&#x27;t be returned back. I am regular shopper on Amazon but with this occasion I will cut back. Is unacceptable such a major retailer like Amazon to sale such a bad item for $152.24.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this cologne at full price from retail stores and loved it. My only concern was would this be an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; product with limited smell, or would it be a great knock off. Well so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;Orignal</li>
    <li> too bad you can&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s  knockoff. or the real thing.  I received a defective bottle, the company quickly replaced it.  It was green tweed and for 20 years have loved it.</li>
    <li> I had decided to purchase my bottle of GIT from Amazon and found this seller.  My old bottle of GIT (personally purchased from my city&#x27;s authorised Creed seller) would last 10+ hrs on me and still have strong sillage.  This product sold by Amerifume looks identical to my old bottle but lasts 5hr&#x27;s at best on my skin and by the time 4-5 hrs has reached, the scent is non existant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake? - I couldn&#x27;t say because it does last as long as my old bottle of authentic Creed GIT&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it? - At your own discretion, if one doesn&#x27;t wish to spend $300+ for 120ml&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells exactly like the authentic GIT but doesn&#x27;t last long as mentioned, so I have a suspicion that this is a rejected batch from Creed that somehow got out into the market for resell.  I came to this conclusion because the bottle and packaging are exactly the same as the authentic, but this product on Amazon has&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) The batch number filed off the back of the bottle (At least on my bottle)&lt;br /&gt;b) The bottom of the box I got (Different from these pictures shown) does not have the sticker on the bottom left showing ingredients, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this isn&#x27;t a rejected batch from Creed that got onto the market, then what else could it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars are for Amerifume finding rejected bottles or 5 stars for Amerifume having found exact replicas.</li>
    <li> I have used GIT before. A great fragrance in my opinion, but the price is a bit too hard to swallow! I finished my original bottle (purchased through Creed outlet) and decided to try another one through amazon. Since this was sold directly by Amazon and not by a 3rd party market place dealer, I was feeling confident about getting a good bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle that I received was nothing like what I had before. Definitely an old stock and/or counterfeit. The Arabic lettering in the box indicates the stock was sourced through the middle east perhaps? Anyway, be very careful when buying this through Amazon.</li>
    <li> this fragrance is classy... just the best I&#x60;ve ever tried... Im about to try other Creed fragrances: Aventus, Millesime Imperial and Virgin Island Water</li>
    <li> There are several indicators you can use to spot a fake outlined on youtube.  Just do a youtube search for \\&quot;fake creed\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll get instructions on how to tell if what you&#x27;re buying is fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received did not have the proper insert, and the etching on the outside of the box was less detailed than a legitimate one.  The scent didn&#x27;t last beyond two hours.  Legit Creed will still be lingering 7-8 hours after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creed has a shelf life of 5-6 years.  Often the bottles sold by 3rd parties (meaning anyone not Neiman or Creed) are improperly stored or purchased at a discount because the batch is already old or close to expiration.</li>
    <li> Ordered through Amazon itself, normal delivery arrived the next day at a great price. Checked the bottle, looked good, checked the sprayer, three/four pumps before it sprayed (unused), and I loved GIT. First spray calmed my soul, GIT fills your nose with Iris and Violet, very fresh smelling. It settles on my skin very nicely. Unlike Aventus, where whiffs will randomly hit my noise throughout the day, and always a pleasure. Pretty quickly I&#x27;m unable to smell it besides some lingering sense of its presence on the back of throat (can&#x27;t explain it). It doesn&#x27;t last as long as me as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s worth every penny at a great price through Amazon. Whatever issue I&#x27;ve had with any product that I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon itself, they promptly take care of it with return shipping covered. Their customer service is outstanding. I can&#x27;t speak for other outlets</li>
    <li> My all time favorite. Thank You.</li>
    <li> This my second purchase GIT from Amazon. Cost and performance are exceptional!!!</li>
    <li> Creed Green Irish Tweed is by far my favorite cologne, but the one I order from here just doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as strong/good as the same one I buy at Niemann&#x27;s.  Maybe I was already mentally expecting it to be that way after reading some of the reviews, but when I put it on it just doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping that it would be the same since it was such a better deal, but I think that I will (unfortunately) have to buck up and pay full price at the local mall.  :(</li>
    <li> When I met my boyfriend, he was wearing this sent. He has tried several different ones since, but nothing is as good as this one on him. His natural scent must agree with this product well. Wish it is less expensive, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews online calling this \\&quot;One of the Best Colognes under the radar\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;The cologne that George Clooney Wears\\&quot;. I liked a lot of the back story about the cologne. I don&#x27;t much remember now, but something about how it was created for a Hollywood starlet in the 50s or 60s and that it was British. I mean slap a $150 price tag on those two facts and I was pretty excited to use this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the hype was not even close to met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne smells decent. But, it reminds me of one of the many dime store colognes I would find on my brother&#x27;s dresser about 15 years ago. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but, it smells a bit common and honestly, a bit cheap. The one review I remember reading that was pretty accurate compared it to a ridiculously over priced bottle of Cool Water. That&#x27;s pretty spot on. I&#x27;ve got a decent collection of top shelf cologne and this one has received by the far the least acknowledgment from my peers. I would also warn that if you do really like the smell at first (Cool Water) try it out for a day or two. I&#x27;m happy if I can smell it after an hour or two, let alone 4-5 hours into the evening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did order this cologne offline and I&#x27;ve read some reviews that point out contrasting results with department stores products. I can&#x27;t really claim one way or another on that. If you find it at a department store and like the smell, I would just caution you to try it out for a day and see if it lasts long enough to be worth the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean it&#x27;s nice to feel a bit cultured when putting on a cologne with such an interesting story. However, when it comes down to it, Green Irish Tweed would fit right into the $39-$59 range just fine. Paying anything beyond that for this cologne is honestly just pretentious.</li>
    <li> Creed is ten times better at this price especially when its legit! Keep in mind Creed has changed their sprayers on the newr Aventus and Green Irish Tweed as I bought 2 bottles from Nieman Marcus to compare to and one had the new spayer and was informed its brand new from creed and is supposed to leak less than the mammoth spayers... This product has the new sprayer and is LEGIT CALL CREED OR NIEMANS I DID AND THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THE SWITCH ITS REAL!!!</li>
    <li> Received a bottle of Green Irish Tweed sold directly by Amazon.  While the bottle appears to be authentic, the scent does not last at all.  The batch number appears to be recent and from 2014, however the scent does not last more than an hour even with 4 sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Aventus I got from Neiman Marcus, one spray lasts for 6 to 8 hours easily.</li>
    <li> Creed makes the best colognes ! Pricey but worth every dollar ! Long lasting . Worked out at the Gym and females still loved the scent . Not over powering .</li>
    <li> I am a woman who loves men&#x27;s cologne better than fruity or overly floral women&#x27;s cologne.  This is a clean, very fresh scent that I love to wear with sports clothes. It is strong at first, but airs out quickly. Very nice fragrance - green, woodsy, fresh-from-a-waterfall scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just amazing girls love it omg get compliments everyday smells amazing and last pretty long dont go with cool water trust me get this right now!!!</li>
    <li> I like it, but I am not sure if the bottle is fake or real.</li>
    <li> I purchased Creed Green Irish Tweed, 4 oz. bottle on March of 2014 from Amazon Direct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received was a fake. This was a pretty good fake, as most fakes in the $150 dollar price range usually are. The box, the business card, paper insert, bottle, and cap appeared to be legit. The problem was in the sprayer cap. All creed fragrances are embossed with the words, \\&quot;Creed\\&quot; on every cap. This sprayer cap did not have the words embossed. Also, the height of the sprayer was not consistent with the height of all creed sprayers in their Milleseme line. The fake sprayer sat much lower. Also, when you take the spray cap off, the lining inside the atomizer should be all white, not clear, nor a translucent white. The fake had a plastic lining that was clear and did not have that white creed plastic. Additionally, genuine Creed fragrances are famous for their \\&quot;burst\\&quot; when you push down on their sprayers. A fake usually cannot mimic the quality and amount that a genuine Creed sprayer sprays. Of course, my fake sprayed an amount that was not consistent with a genuine creed sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of us do not want to pay the full $330 dollar price tag of a creed, so we choose to buy from the grey market where these fragrances actually come from. Amazon is not an official supplier of Creed. Sometimes, either knowingly or unknowingly, fakes end up in Amazon Direct&#x27;s 3rd. party distributor&#x27;s supply chain. My recommendation is to buy only from Amazon Direct ( because of their speedy, customer-centric service) but get a real sample from a retail chain that is an official supplier of Creed such as Macys.  Finally, use your sample from an official Creed retailer and check the consistency of the smells from an online purchase of Creed. Do not spray a suspected fake on your skin as fake fragrances contain anything from goat pee to very cheap and toxic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to do your homework on what a real Creed fragrance looks and smells like. Know what the real ones look like from packaging, bottle, and smell. Go to a Macys or another official supplier of Creed fragrances and carefully examine the Creed cologne bottles, especially the one you are purchasing online. Compare the real one from the Amazon Direct one you purchased. If you&#x27;re still having doubts, bring the actual bottle to a Creed retailer and check everything there. Just be aware that it is in their best interest to get you to buy from them at the full retail price. Then again, buying from a genuine Creed boutique is not a bad idea and saves you the hassle of fakes if you have that kind of cash to spend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you if you are interested in buying from Amazon. You can still get legitimate Creed fragrances, especially from Amazon Direct, but you have to do your homework first in order to spot a fake Creed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shopping!he real ones look like from packaging, bottle, and smell. Go to a Macys or another official supplier of Creed fragrances and carefully examine the Creed cologne bottles, especially the one you are purchasing online. Compare the real one from the Amazon Direct one you purchased. If you&#x27;re still having doubts, bring the actual bottle to a Creed retailer and check everything there.

    <li> I currently own 6 bottles of Creed and just ordered 2 more. All of them have come from Amazon except one that I got at the mall. I have had no problems with quality or authenticity in my opinion. Yes my bottles have the arabic writing but all seem to be best quality. I have loved cologne collecting since middle school. Everything I knew about cologne was from department stores and my first favorite since 7th grade was Cool Water. When I learned of &amp;#34;Parfums&amp;#34; vs &amp;#34;Toilettes&amp;#34; and discovered Creed I was so excited when I smelled GIT. It was the first one I purchased. I felt that is was a refined and more sophisticated version of Cool Water. I love all Creed scents and keep ordering them, usually without even smelling them. I enjoy having 30+ bottles to choose from when I wake up in the morning and I purchase Creed with confidence knowing I will enjoy their proudcts!</li>
    <li> this and imperial are my two favorite creed scents.  Better to have both in your collection cause they have completely different smells.  Tweed is more a daytime fresh scent and imperial is more a formal night scent imo.  Overall i like it and amazon has great price with authentic product.</li>
    <li> If u want to smell good for your lady then this is the perfect cologne</li>
    <li> Yes, I agree with some of the other reviews this is NOT an official Creed product. The smell in similar, but it does not last. Beware it can not be returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance but I ordered parfum and got toilet water!  The descriptive card inside was clearly marked aux de toilette!</li>
    <li> Outstanding smell. Package did contain Arabic writing. Have never purchased it from another source, so I can&#x27;t compare the smell or longevity.</li>
    <li> I just purchased a 4oz bottle from amazon.com shipping, and it smells exactly as I expected. The top notes, base notes, etc. are just as I remember them, and the smell lasts a long time. The code on the bottle is A3212J01, which I think means it was bottled in 2012 but correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST cologne manufactured by anyone</li>
    <li> Very high quality product. I like it because its a very fresh and different fragrance, I recommend it. No doubt.</li>
    <li> Please read and take into consideration before you purchase. I bought the Creed cologne after smelling it on a friend. The smell was very impressive. I found it here on Amazon at a great price.  I read the reviews and found that there were mixed feelings that there may be some quality issues. I took a chance since it was Amazon. Well I am very disappointed. The cologne was not up to par. The smell didn’t match the one my buddy had bought. And I did do a quality test and used the ladies in my office. Since I spend a lot of money for the product I wanted to exchange the item. Amazon will not return or exchange any cologne since they may be flammable. I am a little pssed since I really like Amazon and shop with them all of the time. I never leave a review so you know that there must be an issue. Even if it is an exchange I would be happy. But I am stuck… Anyone want to buy my bottle?</li>
    <li> This must be the wrong product. Cent doesn&#x27;t last up to 2 mins. Regret spending this King of money on this item.</li>
    <li> A greatly unique scent!</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely awesome. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very good when it first came in the mail I was not to sure about how it would mix with my natural state but I love it thanks GlobalCoreStore.com</li>
