<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect n for a great price</li>
    <li> Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
    <li> Okay so I just received these brushes today and i already see shedding on the bigger face brushes. Also it says that it is a 32 piece set but my set is missing one . I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I&#x27;m just giving a review on how they arrived.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Exactly what it said it was.</li>
    <li> Am actually quite disappointed with this purchase.  Probably should have known it was too good a deal, price wise, for them to be much quality.  Most of the brushes were synthetic, material too smooth to even be able to pick up and hold makeup to apply.  Bristles were falling out immediately, the ferrules on quite a number of them were loose and sloppy and the whole set had an unappealing odor</li>
    <li> Yes, initially there is a paint like smell, but if you let it set out for a day the smell almost completely goes away.  That is just the bag it comes in, there is no more smell at all on the brushes.  They are great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good quality and comes in clean and packed neatly. Where else can you buy something like this for so little? It&#x27;s great, although i wish it came with an angular brush and some brushes do repeat in the set i have received. Other than that it&#x27;s still a steal!</li>
    <li> Love it really soft ☺</li>
    <li> Great quality and so many options of brushes for every makeup application! Definitely would recommend this to someone looking for great quality at a low price!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Great quality brushes. Unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> They smell really bad</li>
    <li> I give these 5 stars. I&#x27;m just a 19 year old girl who absolutely loves makeup. I enjoy applying and watching videos of make up. These brushes are great. The only thing I would note is there is no blending brush for eyeshadow. No problem really.</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty good; I just wish they were labeled.  But they work great and I had no problems with shedding.</li>
    <li> The material is not good</li>
    <li> the brushes were soft and so useful !~~</li>
    <li> I just got my order yesterday! I am not happy with the brushes. VERY cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought all my brusheds off amazon and always received GREAT quality. However, I&#x27;m am not happy with these brushes at all. I love the packaging it came .. it was the only thing good about my order.</li>
    <li> Awful!! Total waste of money. I purchased these brushes thinking that I was getting a deal. When I used them, the bristles from the brushes were all over my face. Wow. I tried a few of the other brushes in the pack, same thing. The only &amp;#34;stable&amp;#34; item was the eyebrow brush. Didn&#x27;t feel like dealing with the process of sending them back, so I just threw them away. What a waste. 😡</li>
    <li> Love this! Got my items quick. The brushes are great for the price</li>
    <li> I love my new brushes! Perfect!</li>
    <li> I love them. I love how soft they are and how great they work.</li>
    <li> Just got mine today love them!!! And great price</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my friend . She said she loved the product so far ! She also said she loved that it came with a case for all the brushes . The only thing she didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t tell you what brush is used for what.</li>
    <li> Good for someone who is really great with makeup. It was too much for my everyday normal use.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used my new brushes yet... But they look good. I washed them and there was minimal fall out... They are soft and decent quality considering the price point.</li>
    <li> This was a value for everything you get! I bought it for my daughter but I bought another one for myself.</li>
    <li> it gets the job done. They do shed a little.</li>
    <li> I love them! So soft and the price is amazing!! There is 2 of some brushes in here, like the most comely used ones. It&#x27;s a great starter kit for someone going into beauty school cuz u get a lot for a great price with great quality. **when you first open it will smell kinda like paint but after about an hr or so it goes away***</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes and very good quality</li>
    <li> Should have brought better brushes. Inexpensive is NEVER THE WAY TO GO.  Too much shedding for make up utensils. lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Hairs shed and brush tips fell off..</li>
    <li> Wow, I was impressed! The bristles are fine and there a lot of different ones that I have used before. I love the case and the best is the price! It was definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Disappointing! In description it says professional high quality brushes. Sadly, this is not true. Half of the 32 brushes are worthless. Lies, more like 2/3 of it is absolutely useless. They feel like children paint brushes that you can buy for $1 a set at Walmart. Not to mention the fact that there is a lack of variety of eyeshadow brushes. I ended up buying a new makeup brush set for a little more and I&#x27;m happy that I can use them. I wish there had been a better review or some kind of warning because this was an absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love these professional quality brushes!!!!!</li>
    <li> Came early. Was a present for my fiance... She absolutely loves it</li>
    <li> Regret buying them. Extremely disappointed</li>
    <li> Really enjoy these brushes. They are perfect for a light look, as they don&#x27;t pick up powder heavily, but for me that is perfect! If you love a very natural, glowing, fresh look then these are the brushes for you.</li>
    <li> Love love love this! The brushes are high quality &amp; the packaging is awesome! However, amazon was incredibly RUDE when I contacted them about my order. They actually hung up on me...</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. I don&#x27;t know how I have gone so long without them.</li>
    <li> Not too bad for the price, the bristles were not the same color as pictured, there black, and mine came yellow.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money its not worth it, the brush set was very cheaply made and some of the bigger brushes were loosing the hair which sucked because they look great in the pics but their not!!</li>
    <li> Way fast shipping on order. The brushes are great</li>
    <li> SO many to pick and choose from. Such a great purchase for such little price. Loved it.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Has a brush for everything !! I only hadyo buy a foundation brush because it didn&#x27;t bring one</li>
    <li> Do not buy anything from these people in quantity my school purchased 33 computer connectors and only 22 arrived (one arrived broken)  they continue to refuse to replace the missing peices</li>
    <li> These brushes really suck I bought them cuz of how great a deal they were but no they&#x27;re terrible whenever I use them to apply foundation or power or anything tons of bristles fall out, there hasn&#x27;t been one time when I&#x27;ve used these brushes and that hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
    <li> Everything arrive on time, love the item.</li>
    <li> The brushes don&#x27;t work. Hairs fall out and they don&#x27;t grab onto shadow powder. It&#x27;s not worth the buy. Keep looking out there. I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll find better.</li>
    <li> Was not pleased with my brushed,should have order a more expense set.</li>
    <li> I ordered mine on Friday and received them today ! I am fascinated ! I love them ! It&#x27;s good quality, what else could you ask for that price ? 100% recommended !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t have much of any expectation of this brush set, but when it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to find that, not only does the handy case look professional, but the brush quality is amazing considering the price.  I thought for certain the brush hairs would easily fall out during application but thus far this item has been simply aces and I have had it for months.</li>
    <li> There is a reason they are so cheap. I was so excited to get these but when they came I was disappointed. The bristles are not quality and are not very soft. If you do not care that much about quality or quality of your makeup, then I&#x27;m sure these will be good for you. But as I&#x27;m getting older, I&#x27;ve realized the importance of using quality products on my face. I like to have my foundation on evenly and my eyeshadow blended, and these brushes just do not do it for me.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, the bristols are very soft and great for your traveling make up kit!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter as a gift.  She absolutely loved it. Tons of brushes, all different styles and sizes. Reasonable priced and freak quality.</li>
    <li> Half of my brushes have hair falling off of them</li>
    <li> came in early and were all in great condition. qulity wasnt as good as i had expected but over all i like them and use then every day</li>
    <li> fell apart poor quality</li>
    <li> It was a decent brush set. I like having the large amount of brushes but some of the bristles for the large ones are falling out, and they don;t pick up alot of product. Otherwise good starter kit and I&#x27;m glad to have it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes. They blend so well and they are easy to use. I don&#x27;t have anything to complain about. By fair the best brush set I have ever bought online!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing.  Such a wide variety</li>
    <li> Bad fell apart not recommending this to use over priced</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not good at all, dont waste your money on them</li>
    <li> Super soft and easy to wash brushed!! Wish there were a few blending brushes but they are so great and an amazing price!</li>
    <li> I will never have to buy individual brushes again!  Saved me a lot of money!</li>
    <li> Good product for beginners. The flat ones that fan out...kinda cheap &amp; shed.</li>
    <li> The bristles were falling out almost immediately after receiving them</li>
    <li> great set of brushes, soft and well made...love them</li>
    <li> Awesome brush set! Every brush you will ever need. They&#x27;re definitely not MAC brushes but you get what you pay for and they do the job just fine. Good quality, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I like the fact there is a lot of brushes to choose from. It&#x27;s alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I wasn&#x27;t really attracted to them. The bristle are way to stiff to blend nicely when apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can work with any brushes, but these sets are kind of far fetch to be do-able.</li>
    <li> I was scared because there&#x27;s many mix reviews on here. I received the brushes last Friday and so far so good. I will update this review later to see if I&#x27;m still happy with them.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and of good quality</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes. Works pretty good maybe even better . The price is worth it. I compared them to Tarte brushes they work as good.</li>
    <li> So happy to received these! Brushes are in good quality, very soft. One very disappointing thing is after I opened it, those brushes smells really really bad.. Worse than paint smell..</li>
    <li> These brushes are hella cheap! Their not how they look in the picture all fluffy brushes. Their like basically all the exact same ones. It doesnt include a blending brush . The face brushes we&#x27;re a little rough and get a lot of fall out.</li>
    <li> Not as soft as a thought but it manageable..very well delivered and fast!!</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re s***, most of them are just shadow brushes</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive these brushes. I am relatively new to serious makeup and wanted a big set that I could practice with and these definitely fit the bill. On the con side there was some shedding and I do not particularly like the face brushes but they will definitely work as intended. I am overall happy that I was ab;e to find such an inclusive set at such an amazing price and shipping because I have been burned within recent memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually showed off some of what these babies can do here if you are interested:&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;16ffAy97CPc</li>
    <li> These brushes were amazing at first! I mean, for the price, it had me hooked! But, I got them in the mail and noticed the paint smell that everyone was talking about, but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I tried them out the next day and thought, wow! These brushes are a life savor! A week went by and  day by day I got more dissopointed, the brush hairs were falling off each day- shedding. I just thought they needed to be washed. I wash all my makeup applicators every week, like they should. And when I washed these, the whole brush heads fell apart. I could literally gently pull at the brush head and all the hairs would fall out, leaving just the ends for me. I was so disappointed. But, on a brighter side the eye brushes, for me, work the best! They don&#x27;t fall apart like the face brushes. So maybe this will help some of you when ordering this product!(:</li>
    <li> no matter what make up case i buy there is always that one piece that falls off before i even get to use it. but i like the variety of this one, very nice.</li>
    <li> Received it pretty fast! The bag does smell like paint. But I don&#x27;t care about that, the brushes are great I used them right away no hairs fall out! Once theses are all worn out I will definitely order again especially with that price!!</li>
    <li> Honestly, These are great brushes. They pick up product well, and if you are one to use a lot of product (Accidently) Then these brushes are for you. They are like a sponge almost. It lets you take in product, but once it is full, it&#x27;s full.. It will fall right out of the brush. As would water to a sponge. Great product in all and all</li>
    <li> My girlfriend just about melted when i got her this for Christmas. Highly advise as a simple cheap gift.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend these brushes to many people. The larger brushes are not dense at all and apply little to no product. There are too many flat, concealer like brushes that are close to useless and the others are small and do not serve any purpose. I would save the hassle and purchase a set that includes denser brushes that don&#x27;t shed with a wider variety of uses. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> The smaller brushes are awesome but the red Bristle brushes are terrible</li>
    <li> This was a gift to a real makeup lover.&lt;br /&gt;She really loves this and all the many brushes for various products ts.</li>
    <li> Great price and brushes quality!</li>
    <li> The brushes are very sturdy and soft. They came in a nice case and look very sleek. I found that the overall face brushes (the bigger ones) worked well. The eye brushes however did not. I have very high end and pigmented shadows and it shows hardly any color on the lids. Even E.L.F brushes worked so much better.</li>
    <li> I love this item, it was exactly as described.  Love It! Thhis item shipped timely it actually arrived earlier than promised which was great.  I showed them to a friend who does make up and she tried to steal them, I said go to Amazon and get you a set.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for an even more amazing price. Bought both pink and black set!</li>
    <li> Great brushes, good deal! Very Professional</li>
    <li> Great set! The only issue I had was that the brow comb/brush broke instantly, although that&#x27;s not a big deal. The other brushes work great, and are soft. I do wish they had some sort of labeling system though, even if it was just numbered. They also come in plastic sheaths, which really helps keep them neat and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Omg! I love it, I love it, I love it (singing voice). Now I can have  that extra umph and flare when applying my make up.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my teen-aged daughter who ask for it as a Christmas present. She loves it! Great deal for all of the quality brushes included and the case.</li>
    <li> Just got them in used them and they are great! The price is great and I would recommend them!</li>
    <li> Rough brushes, not professional quality, and the brush heads fall right off the stick!!!! Don&#x27;t recommend at all. Will be looking for a more professional set.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good brushes for the price you&#x27;re paying. They arrived really quickly. They&#x27;re GREAT practice brushes for someone who is just getting started with makeup. And the case is nice, too.</li>
    <li> Great brushes my daughter love thems</li>
    <li> I like it but the big brushes are not made of good material because they drop hairs :( the rest shadow brush are ok :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good value  for the price and the quantity was right on.</li>
    <li> Excelente Producto !!!! A+++</li>
    <li> My daughter purchased these and loves them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are not that soft and shed A LOT!</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft to the touch. I have really sensitive skin, and these worked perfectly! I was a little disappointed that the set did not come with all 32 pieces. The brushes are dirty and have some dust on them so I would suggest cleaning them before use.</li>
    <li> No smell, good quality.</li>
    <li> I have quickly picked out my favorites.  There are a lot of variations of the same brush which I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever reach for. I like the powder brush.  I wish there were fluffier eyeshadow brushes.  There are decent for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay the brushes shread. The metal pieces comes off at times I had to glue them back. All in all it will get u by.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes...came on time! Will recommend to my friends !</li>
    <li> I love them! There is a huge variety in the brushes, and the carrying case is super durable. The bushes hold product well and wash easily, and are not easily scuffed or scratched. A great dupe for sigma or nars brushes.</li>
    <li> Other than the smell when u first get it , im in love with the brushes  work good .</li>
    <li> The brushes actually came early. they are nice but it seems like all the brushes are similar.</li>
    <li> Got my brushes today they was a mess the Bristol&#x27;s was coming off the red ones the all the big brushes was the worse ones because most of the Bristols was hanging off .... Kinda upset cause thought was gone be a great buy</li>
    <li> Well worth the money but hard as s****t to clean them 😔</li>
    <li> They are perfect, I hope to use them soon.</li>
    <li> Love it. Just wish it came with a brush guide</li>
    <li> I love most of these. I have some repeats, which I like, and they are really soft. Mine seem to be put together well. The case does smell like plastic, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. Some of the brushes bristles were messed up, but great value for the price.  [...][...][...]</li>
    <li> Not what I expected ...the brushes don&#x27;t work and the one that do I don&#x27;t use anyways not worth it .</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on these brushes. They shed horribly. When I first purchased them I was a little hesitate about making this purchase because I saw a number of reviews about this item shedding and others thought they were wonderful but instead of going with my instinct and not purchasing them I decided to give it a try. Worst decision ever!  I also tried different tricks to prevent/stop them from shedding; that still didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> Very stiff brushes. But good for the price</li>
    <li> They come with a strong chemical smell and some of the brush bristles fall out when washed. Despite that, considering the price i think is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Love love love these! More than I could have expected for the price. Great quality</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece and saw her using it. I must say the quality is pretty decent considering the price of this. The brushes are soft, made from natural soft hair and synthetic fiber. She explained me it has to be that way otherwise it would not last at all and this way brushes get the firmness you need to use it. I recommend this and I think it&#x27;s a great value for money. I just took one star because the plastic had some smell but nothing invasive.</li>
    <li> Great price and good product.  The only thing that I did not like was the very strong chemical smell.  Other than that, great value.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup brushes kits helps me with a lot of things thank buy it helps</li>
    <li> I ordered the brushes may 12 and the estimated delivery date was June 13 but I got them may 28 ! So supper fast shipping the brushes are great ! Wicked soft but strong !</li>
    <li> The larger brushes have quite a bit of bristle fallout. Not particularly soft, either. It&#x27;s okay for someone&#x27;s first ever brush set, like me, but I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes! There is a slight smell coming from them but nothing that has me worried since I&#x27;ve bought products like these before and have never had a problem. I really like the face brushes I&#x27;ve been using them daily and the eyeshadow brushes rival  brushes I have bought from Sonia Kashuk which I have used for years. Recommend if you are trying to figure out which style brushes work best for you!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered fast and was new as stated i just thought they would be more plush (Soft) but i guess they are worth what i.payed for and do a good job</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, good quality, this was a gift and my best friend LOVED these brushes!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised good quality thx</li>
    <li> Very happy with te brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Was surprised  at how durable they are.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase more as gifts.</li>
    <li> I would never recommend these brushes to anyone. Its coarse and the hair keeps falling out. Quality is like a paint brush. It hurts and turns my face red when I apply makeup on. Horrible quality, horrible brushes. I hate it so much.</li>
    <li> It is not the same product I saw in the photo.</li>
    <li> they came right on time for xmas .my best friend loved the set, she said it held more powder and they were easy to blend with.</li>
    <li> Amazing price for so many good brushes, but after a while the metal part attaching the brush hairs to the wooden stick can become loose. However, all it needs is a bit of super glue and they&#x27;re good as new.</li>
    <li> Cheap and some of them were broken...</li>
    <li> There was a smell when I first opened them but I wasn&#x27;t too bad and it went away after a little while. They are pretty soft and everything was there and they were in pretty good condition when they arrived.</li>
    <li> After purchase i change my mind and i wanted to return it but they solve the issue and have a good customer service...very happy&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> Love these brushes they are super soft and easy to work with! Such a great value, I have had only one brush that shed. The only suggestion I would have is for more rounded brushes in the set.</li>
    <li> These brushes shed horribly!!! I tried to clean the face brushes and they shed so bad and the color  came off in the water! The worst purchase ever!!</li>
    <li> What a Great deal on this! I have every type of makeup brush I could possibly want and was affordable...Nice quality and comes in a nice case that keeps it all organized!</li>
    <li> These brushes are good. You get what you pay for, only complaints i have about them is some of the brushes are exactly the same and don&#x27;t really pick up product well. But other them that majority of them are great brushes :)</li>
    <li> I SAW HORRIBLE REVIEWS AT 1ST BUT I WANTED TO GIVE THEM A TRY.  THE LITTLE ONES ARE SUPPER STIFF!!!!!! yet i still found use for them so i didnt really whine. but the big ones are super soft but shed horribly, but ill deal with it for personl use and not professional use. but honestly they break and its embarrassing, the tops all fell off of mine! its ridiculous!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got my brushes and the hair is falling out tf!!!</li>
    <li> No problems, received on time!</li>
    <li> One of my hobbies is a makeup artist for family and friends. I love the various sizes of brushes...I will be ordering more very soon!</li>
    <li> Really good byt sort of have an odor</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good cheap addtion to begin my makeup brush collection but I was wrong all of the eyebrushes are similar to each other so 15 brushes are useless because they aren&#x27;t fluffy or capable of blending out your eyeshadow.  Honestly save some money and buy some e.l.f brushes or real techniques brushes or save up for sephora or MAC brushes. These aren&#x27;t great and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone. There is a large fan brush that seems useable along with five other face brushes and two eyebrow and spoolie brushes other than that there are just gonna be brushes taking up space</li>
    <li> decent brushes for price. actually surprised, they were decent. rolled holder was great as well. impressed for price . got here next day with amazon prime</li>
    <li> The where delivered quickly I was so excited to use them on bridesmaids this wk end only to find ALOT OF THEM WHERE MISSING...I usually have great experiences w/ all my AMAZON purchases this was disappointing GREAT QUALITY THOUGH...</li>
    <li> The metal piece keeps falling off.. what a disappointment!!!! I regret purchasing these brushes!!!! I was so excited when I first got them but its sooo not worth it.. I hate them..</li>
    <li> This brush set seems pretty good to me. No shedding, and although there was a paint smell at first, it went away quickly. Unfortunately, there are a lot of duplicate brushes, and since I&#x27;m new to this, it would be really nice if there were labels on the brushes, or even just a paper included that lists what each brush is. They seem very soft, and haven&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin at all though. If I ever figure out what each brush is, I&#x27;ll update with a list for the other newbies.</li>
    <li> Great brush set! Well made and way worth the price!</li>
    <li> These brushes are not very good. I sent them back and got a refund. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Excellent sellers. I recommend 100%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neyeska.</li>
    <li> I had to write today to say that I was amazed over the brush set.i would even recommend this set to a professional makeup artist. Great product!</li>
    <li> Totally agree with the comments the foundation/face brushes are useless. Tried washing them and they still shed profusely. Eye shadow and concealer brushes are okay a little to thick and plasticky. Eye and eyebrow brushes are the best. Worth the price maybe if you just want some extra brushes.</li>
    <li> The bigger fluffier face brushes shed horribly, the smaller eye and concealer brushes I love, they don&#x27;t shed at all!</li>
    <li> As a hobby I play with make up and different  techniques.  I have bought several brush sets but this is worth  every penny if you are trying to learn how to use different looks. You need luggage to transport  it but I have had so much fun. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because the whole set isn&#x27;t useless. Most of the brushes shed like crazy. I actually needed a lint brush to get rid of all the fall out that landed on my top. Only some of the brushes are soft. I actually had to go back to using my elf brushes because I was not happy with this brush set. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this set.</li>
    <li> Did my little sister makeup with these brushes, but it was quite hard to blend. I had a hard time blending the concealer and eye shawdows. It shed like crazy. They apply good though. :-)</li>
    <li> Nice selection of brushes. I have only used a few.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay buy. Brushes are soft and durable but most of the brushes are exactly the same. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> The hair is ok on the larger brushes I mean they are pretty good for contouring but the littler brushes are very good. Especially if you want a stiffer brush for things like eye liner and concealer its perfect. Glue is good on the handle too very sturdy!</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes and was very excited! They came more quickly than I anticipated I wash my brushes before first use as I am supposed to, first let me say if you have sensitive skin these brushes are not for you. The bristles are really rough, then the handle came off 2 of them after first use. I am NOT a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Bought for my sister and she loves the set.</li>
    <li> I loved it, it came two days earlier. I got this as a gift, I opened it, there was a smell, but not a bad smell. Although the brushes have no name, they are a little rough, but not too bad, they do pick up nicely and get the job done! Worth paying for.</li>
    <li> Brushes came on time but you get what you pay for. Horrible quality. Smells funny. One broke as soon as I opened it. I would just invest in some elf brushes they&#x27;re only $1-$3 &amp; better quality.</li>
    <li> Love these! They are really nice brushes for a good price!</li>
    <li> Amazing deal for some amazing quality!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!! They have every brush imaginable that you may need. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> The brushes are good beginner brushes. I would not buy them if you are a professional makeup artist because the quality isn&#x27;t the best. But great for a beginner to practice with.</li>
    <li> This brush set is pretty extensive for the price you are paying. You get 32 brushes and a little leather bag that comes with it for storage, however I have only had this brush set for 2 weeks now. The first three days of using the brush set, and I already have two broken brushes including the contour brush which I use often. I know it&#x27;s only a matter of gluing it all back together, but it&#x27;s still a little bit of an inconvenience at times because it wasn&#x27;t free. So far I don&#x27;t have any or much shedding at all, but I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time. I want to be as realistic and as honest as possible with this review, yes, the brush set is a deal, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I had been anticipating the arrival of these brushes for about two weeks. When they finally arrived, I opened my package to find a horrible smell coming from the pleather case these brushes were wrapped in. Seriously, I thought my nose was going to fall off! HORRIBLE SMELL! The brushes aren&#x27;t too smelly but I would recommend you soak them before using and ditch the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder, fan, and blush brushes are  all very big and fluffy. My fan brush is shedding, badly, but I&#x27;m sure it will stop eventually as brushes usually do. There are ALOT of small and stiff eyeshadow brushes..... and a lot of people are complaining they cant find use for them. It&#x27;s all about getting your money&#x27;s worth! No, these are not the best quality but I will be using them and my makeup will still be BOMB! Go on Youtube and research how to soften stiff brushes, and you&#x27;ll be fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they included a blending brush but aye.....I&#x27;ll live.</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes is really low. But then again, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY BRUSHESSSSS!!! they came right on time everything is so nice I used them yesterday to get ready for work and was feeling myself you hear me. lmaooo.no shedding at all when you use them or wash them. the only thing is the paint smell but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all. buy them these are great to start your brush collection.</li>
    <li> What an awesome value! Must buy</li>
    <li> They have a horrible smell and the hair fibers are falling off and stick to my face just by using lightly.</li>
    <li> Wonderful item it makes putting my makeup on easy, Super great item you want regret it, so go to Amazon and order it great price,</li>
    <li> Daughter loves each brush and uses almost everyone of them</li>
    <li> Love all of these. It&#x27;s a great deal for 32 makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped promptly! I got it over a week before the estimated delivery date! I bought this set because I figured for $15 even if I only liked 1 or 2 of the brushes it would be worth it.  All of the brushes have a really good texture. They are really soft. I was scared that for that price they would be really rough but they aren&#x27;t I am really pleased with this product. I am also pleased with how well organized the business is I got the product 5 days after I ordered it on standard shipping.</li>
    <li> I previously ordered this exact set of brushes and liked them, so I ordered two more sets. They were great. I ordered an additional 5 sets through the link from the previous orders and the brushes I received are not the same, they are tiny.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a great value</li>
    <li> This set of brushes (including the bag it came with) was definitely a great value for the low price I paid. I don&#x27;t think I could ever find a 32 piece set in a regular store for such a cheap value! The larger, poofy brushes aren&#x27;t that soft and shed some unlike the smaller brushes, but the other brushes are very soft. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Obviously you aren&#x27;t going to get professional quality for the price, but a girl can dream! First off a lot of people were right about the distinct smell these brushes had-but all is well after soaking them in a brush cleaning solution. The 2 main problems i saw were that the bristles on the brushed would fall off either on the makeup container you were dipping them in or on your face alongside the makeup you were applying. The feel of the brushes is very hard and coarse. I guess for desperate times one can use these, but they are definitely going in the bottom of some drawer!</li>
    <li> This is a set of brushes for any and every makeup use I can think of. They are soft on my face and no bristles fall out!  The case is nice and has a built in dust cover then rolls up for storage. Great price and great value!! Work well for me!</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed these brushes initially. After using them for a week, the started to bleed when applying my makeup. I plan to try again after washing them all. A very good price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised on how big this set was!!! I love it and it&#x27;s amazing price!!!😀</li>
    <li> The brushes were stiff and painful to us on my face. And all the brushes are shedding while I do makeup</li>
    <li> This makeup brush set is excellent but when i received it, it smelled like it was airbrushed with black paint.</li>
    <li> The hair brushes kept falling out. Didn&#x27;t like having to remove the brush hair off my face, not worth buying</li>
    <li> It was worthless for the cost of even 20$. It was falling apart upon arrival. There wasn&#x27;t 32 pieces. The hard of the brushes were falling out and were horribly bent and distorted!</li>
    <li> Fast ship on the product which was wonderful.  Product bristles are stiff and not comfortable for applying makeup to the face.</li>
    <li> Sheds a lot but gets the job done I guess</li>
    <li> Honestly I think they are amazing. They look just like the picture. The bag did smell like paint for a few minutes after taking it out of the package but after a few minutes it went away. The brushes are fantastic!!</li>
    <li> The brushes broke in half didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Really great for beginners or someone on a small budget.</li>
    <li> Worst brush set I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> These brushes are ok.  But for 15 dollars I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot.  not sure they would be used by professionals but regular people just wanting to experiment with makeup they would be fun. One of the brushes had terrible bristles.  The smaller ones that are used on the eyes didn&#x27;t seem to have near as many bristles sticking out. At first I thought it was just loose bristles but I tried shaking/rubbing the bristles to get the loose ones to fall but I figure I&#x27;ll just end up trimming for a smoother tip. The larger brushes had plastic covers to prevent  them from becoming too messed up in storage.  Just received will update as needed.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with the product. Brushes are to stiff.</li>
    <li> All brushes came individually protected inside the case all were of much better quality than anticipated. I would buy then again</li>
    <li> The bristles come out! Not to be used for professional makeup application. It&#x27;s only worth what you pay for it.</li>
    <li> These brushes look great for show but they are not really functional. There were a about 25 eye brushes and although the bristles are a lot better than the face brushes they still aren&#x27;t good enough to complete an eye look nicely. There was also no blending eye brush which is disappointing because that is crucial to any eye look. I would give the eye brushes a 3/5 because you can use them but they aren&#x27;t great. The face brushes are a different story. The brush hairs had a different color than the eye brushes and the quality was horrible. They were so harsh and even against my hand they were uncomfortable. I would never put these brushes near my face and I cannot even imagine applying product with them. The belt to hold these brushes was pretty nice although I usually hold my brushes on my vanity with glass containers so I will not be using it much. Overall these brushes are a waste of money although they were so cheap I wouldn&#x27;t buy them because they are not functional.</li>
    <li> I received this product and before I even used it I loved it. The brushes are so soft and looked to be sturdy. However, after the third use a blush brush the actual brush end came unglued from the handle, although this is an easy fix with the glue gun I was highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love them!! I have had them for over 6 months. They haven&#x27;t fallen apart and they haven&#x27;t lost bristles either. I mean you can&#x27;t expect much for $13 but this are definitely worth the money. Like everyone else, I wish they were labeled.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very fantastic for the price and the amount of brushes but it repeats alot of brushes they give you multiple of the same brushes</li>
    <li> really loved this set! great brushes works great and applys make-up pretty good.</li>
    <li> Great deal for all the different brushes. Make up comes out flawless !</li>
    <li> All the brushes were in great condition. So many of them I didn&#x27;t know what they were for</li>
    <li> This is awesome bought it and everything arrived. The brushes blend well but are a little rough.</li>
    <li> Love them !!! A little rough but still works great</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. What you see is what you get!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  This brush set is pretty impressive looking. The case is very nice, each brush has plastic covering and several have additional hard plastic coverings. However, after my first use, two brushes fell apart and another two started to shed hairs from the brushes.  On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best in terms of quality) I would give this item a 5. I&#x27;m afraid that long term use may not prove positive.</li>
    <li> everything included, looks just like the pic, soft</li>
    <li> Very good makeup brushes! Especially for the price. I&#x27;d recommend and buy it again</li>
    <li> I am the queen of make up brush death and am happy to say after months of using these brushes every single one is still perfectly in tact. The carrying case is made of wonderful material and holds up well through daily life. My case still looks brand new even though it has been on four road trips, a toilet escapade, and being hidden in a toy box of doom! The brushes feel absolutely wonderful too! I have super sensitive skin and not a single irritation has occurred from any of the brushes. Also this set includes everything a person needs to pull off an awesome look whether you are going for simple or makeup artist of the year! I do recommend to clean the brushes regularly to prevent color mixing but that&#x27;s on the owner not the brushes themselves!  I am in love with this product and if you are looking for fantastic brushes and a simple carrying case then this is definitely the product for you!</li>
    <li> better than I expected!</li>
    <li> Smooth brushes, cute set, leather case, love it! :) good quality for this price (: came in a few days.</li>
    <li> the bigger brushes shed a lot and are very scratchy but the smaller brushes are soft and usable. I would not recommend though.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes...they are a great set of brushes for a low price...Glad I purchased them to add to my set.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes , they&#x27;re extremely soft</li>
    <li> Wonderful assortment of brushes for all makeup application needs. Even included a eyebrow brush as well as scissors&#x27;! You wont find a better price nor a more inclusive product!</li>
    <li> A few of the brushes the larger ones with the redish brown hairs, are falling apart. On the other hand the others are good quality.</li>
    <li> Great price for so many brushes . The little brushes there are approx 3 or 2 of each. But I use the big powder brushes, they lacked that but I&#x27;ve been using all the brushes they are synthetic. There are no flat top brushes though</li>
    <li> Will probably have to get more of these for my other daughter and maybe even as gifts. Tons of different brushes, very fun for teen-agers and up. Comes in a nice case!</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow brushed are great in this brush set! The face powder brushes on the other hand are really stiff and I personally don&#x27;t use any of them since they cause streaks in your make up applications,</li>
    <li> for the price it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Very good variety, and good quality brushes. Sadly it doesn&#x27;t fit in my makeup case, so I guess I have to buy a bigger one!</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for.. lots of brushes that come in handy.. some brushes i use alot maybe like 2 or 3 out of the bunch are too stiff and bristles fall off.. but over all a good product for the price..</li>
    <li> as a cosmetologist I do not recommend this to professionals but as a beginner I do recommend this product is good but some of the brushes hair is falling out I I&#x27;m a big brush collector they are soft but as you swipe hair does come off it&#x27;s mainly fan bushes and the powder brushes also my smudger the little black Sponge does pop out so by any means this product is a 3 out of 5 I will keep an update on how the brushes work on my face but I will not buy this product again. also be wearing if you do have a sensitive now these do smell like paint brushes really really strong male but does go away within an hour or two</li>
    <li> I was going to give away sets for xmas.And will be ordering more from you.Just woted to love them all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no professional but with these brushes and a few YOUTUBE videos I am pretty close...these brushes are great and there are so many. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Sounds like a good set yet something that won&#x27;t last too long..gaor not jest of quality</li>
    <li> While these brushes are good and work well. Keep brushes away from the water. The brush part *will* separate from the handle. Found this out by accident when they fell in the tub. Lost four or five of them to separation and couldn&#x27;t reattach them using regular household glue. Epoxy might have done the job, though, but I didn&#x27;t try it. Otherwise, good product and would recommend.</li>
    <li> These brushes were sold at a good price. Where else would you get 32 brushes for $13.88? BUT it&#x27;s quality actually fit the price ! There rough &amp; they shed a lot of brisciles during application ! I only use the smaller brushes because they don&#x27;t shed like the larger blush brushes ! It&#x27;s just not a good product.  It was okay for my first brush set purchase but I DONT RECOMMEND !</li>
    <li> Bristles started coming out after 2-3 uses. Good for every day makeup, not professional. Good for the price</li>
    <li> It came with 31 brushes? And one extra wrapper</li>
    <li> Perfect..every piece you need</li>
    <li> These Brushes were amazing . The first time i used them. But after you clean them the bristles start falling out, brushes stay stiff and do not blend well afterwards. But like they say you get what you pay for so spend your money wisely</li>
    <li> These brushes are crappy! They feel soft at first, but cling to old makeup and oils. When I tried cleaning them, the dye from the bristles started washing off. The bag is worthless too. With a couple days it was peeling and coming undone at the seams. I like the variety, but I&#x27;d rather put my money towards quality, not quantity.</li>
    <li> Just got them and I love them!!:D</li>
    <li> These brushes are ok. As a makeup artist I need brushes to stand up to alot of use. These brushes do not fit the bill. They are becoming unglued,  which is embrassing in front of clients.  I would recommend these brushes for personal use but not professionally.</li>
    <li> its of really nice quality. i liked it, i used it every time. im glad i bought it. :) :)</li>
    <li> I ordered a set of these for myself and like them so much that I ordered two additional sets for gifts.  Love them</li>
    <li> I just love this. Its my first but it looks so good. n the brushes are exquisite.</li>
    <li> Love them. I just dont like how the brush hairs fall off when you touch it or when you are using it it leaves then on your face.</li>
    <li> They were soft and more than what i expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a friend and when I took one out of the package the brush came off the stick. I checked for the others and they were loose. VERY EMBARRASING AND DISSAPPOINTING</li>
    <li> Brush bristle fall out. Case is not leather. Multiple brushes were bent upon arrival.</li>
    <li> The hair from the brushes were falling out the very first time I used them. These brushes are cheap &amp; shed as soon as it touches your face.</li>
    <li> Not very good quality at all. Dont recommend. Save your money and buy other ones</li>
    <li> Purchased it for my wife and she loves it. Very soft and high quality without the high price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this set. The nail polish smell was a little overpowering</li>
    <li> This set is so nice and for a beginner like myself honestly its perfect! I love it great quality for the price I paid</li>
    <li> So I was so excited to receive my brushes today but when I opened my package it sort of went away... There is a strong odd smell in the box as well as the packaging it makes me nauseous. The large face brushes do shed a significant amount. Also the eye shadow brushes all look the same. What you receive is nothing like the picture. There are no blending brushes or crease brushes there&#x27;s really no variety. Hopefully this awful smell goes.</li>
    <li> When I opened it, it had very strong smell. I washed all brushes and the bag with shampoo, an the smell is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some of the brushes have one or two bristles out of order, but they were few and no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, it is great comparing to the price. it does the job I bought it for</li>
    <li> use it almost daily. even after cleaning them they are holding strong. very impressed with this set</li>
    <li> These are a part of that you can only use once because there is no way you can clean them without all the bristles falling out.</li>
    <li> Lots of diversity with brush selection but they are constantly loosing bristles. Not good quality. Also not very soft</li>
    <li> Got this to help fill up my Freelance artist kit. It has some great core brushes and a great arrangement of brushes that I can use when applying to more than one client back to back. I don&#x27;t particularly like the face brushes for the quality but I use other brushes for that. I recommend this kit for the eye brushes and great array of brushes offered.</li>
    <li> Updated review.. I like these brushes they are soft cheap and there are a lot of them. Trying to find one to blend my eyeshadow is always hard. They&#x27;re soft but if you have loose eyelids it won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I give this a product a two, the brushes that are supposed to be used to apply foundation are horrible, they are not fluffy at all. Although there were smaller brushes that were nice, there is a repetition f the same brushes</li>
    <li> I got my package thank you !!</li>
    <li> So cheap that I ended up returning them and getting my money back, I was so disappointed. I thought maybe they would be ok brushes but I was wrong! Even the packaging was cheaply made. Never again, next time, I&#x27;ll pay more for better quality.</li>
    <li> Loved all the different sizes many options im in love with them and love the beautiful case uh they came in thank you</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty great! It&#x27;s a lot of brushes for a low price. They may not be the softest but they work really well and get the job done.</li>
    <li> For my sister, but she loved them. The only thing is they don&#x27;t come with labels and you have to look them up.</li>
    <li> Not a professional kit at all but for younger kids trying to explore this is wonderful!</li>
    <li> At first I was SUPER excited about these brushes they were soooo soft and beautiful. I haven&#x27;t even used all of them yet but the few I have are already Falling Apart! I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday so I have only used them a couple times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a few months now and they are fine. Work well but you will need to replace them frequently. The mascara brush snapped, the larger bushes drop tons of bristles, and the eyeshadow applicators have nothing inside the tips to hold the sponge in place. Fine for people who are learning how to apply makeup like me but would disappoint daily users and artists.</li>
    <li> The bigger brushes shead.</li>
    <li> mmm.. okay so I expected a bit better. some brushes look like they are repeated. but yes most are good. they feel like there is very little material.</li>
    <li> My gf is just starting to study to become a make up artist.&lt;br /&gt;Loved them, and her friends loved them as well..</li>
    <li> Amazing ! These brushes came right on time all great all packaged I don&#x27;t go anywhere without them great deal haven&#x27;t even used all brushes yet and I got this awhile ago. If u want cheap amazing brushes I recommend these !!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this brush set. The price was amazing. The brushes came in a nice pouch (I wasn&#x27;t expecting that).</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice, stiff bristles. Doesn&#x27;t have some basic brushes like I thought it would, not going to complain for the price though!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! They did come with a slight smell, but I left it unwrapped for the first few days and it went away. Since I had read some reviews about hair falling out of the brushes, I washed them before I used them. I barely had any hair fall out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these brushes! There are so many for a great price. My only complaint is that they weren&#x27;t labeled and that there isn&#x27;t a flat top foundation brush. However, I still like these and I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Worst brushes ever!  Think they are made from dog hair.  DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Got these back in July and was excited for testing. The eye makeup brushes are a disappointment considering i can hardly use them to apply eyeshadow. Almost like plastic.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t expect much for $15 but this set is a complete waste of money. Unless you want 7 or 8 of the exact same brushes and a couple completely broken brushes.</li>
    <li> Sheds but worth bargain</li>
    <li> I love this set for the price but when my package finally arrived one of the brushes were broken so that was upsetting nothing glue cant fix but it seems that&#x27;s its made a little cheap so beware but its defiantly worth the price for the amount of brushes you receive  and a awesome start up kit for people who are just starting out that&#x27;s why I rate it 4 stars!!!</li>
    <li> i got to try these brushes today and i honestly love them. this was such a good buy and everyone looking for a great make up brushes these are defiantly an option! there soft and very easy to use plus I love the holder it comes in. worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I was not expecting it to be as great as it is! I need new brushes and I thought this was a great deal. I bought them and received in a week. These brushes are so good and the case is really handy.</li>
    <li> I really loved all the brushes minus the big brushes (powder brush, fan brush, blush etc.) There&#x27;s nothing wrong with them really they just don&#x27;t serve much use for me</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup brushes that I ever had!! These have very good quality and last for awhile!</li>
    <li> the hairs of the brushes fall out.. dont look profesional.. may be good for practice with differents brushes but no more</li>
    <li> Scent was a little strong...left outside over night and helped a bit. A lot of fall out..brushes are repeated and synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;arrived on time.</li>
    <li> was not happy with this item when it arrives it had a funny smell the brush does not have no name you have no idea what&#x27;s a a foundation brush. brushes to big.</li>
    <li> I purchased this being new to makeup. I have found this kit to be very handy - the brushes do loose strands at first but they stopped after the 3rd or 4th use.  I would recommend it. It is a good value.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of the different brushes. This is my second set of brushes I use one at work and one at home. These are great. I didn&#x27;t really notice a smell or anything either. If you do just wash them in a water, vinegar and dish soap mix!</li>
    <li> Good brushes no shedding very handy</li>
    <li> They were not what I expected and I want to return them, but I waited too long. Im starting to get into makeup and wanted brushes that I could use to do different things. About 10 of the brushes look exactly the same, and do not apply makeup well. They are flat and you are not able to nicely apply eye shadow because of how flat they are. Wishing I would have just spent a little more money and got what I actually wanted. You get what you pa for..smh</li>
    <li> i bought these since I needed new makeup brushes and was worried they&#x27;d suck since they were so cheap, but glad they proved me wrong. They work great and pick up the makeup just right!</li>
    <li> Nice set of brushes!  Quick service on this item.</li>
    <li> These brushes suck. If u know the value of a brush and how it i suppose to feel u will know they suck. Sorry 👎👎👎👎👎👎</li>
    <li> I have no used these bushes yet! But they are semi good quality by the look and the feel of the brisles. I have read some reviews on the smell, the brushes do stink but it&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s been wrap in plastic and then shipped over seas. The brushes just simplely smell like the brush holder they come in, one wash of the brushes and they won&#x27;t smell, and a wipe down of your holder and it is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your get a little more then what you pay. Over all, 32pc set for $14 is never heard of. Great deal !</li>
    <li> dont like it at all.  brushes are hard and they flake</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice. A lot better than what I was expecting for $14, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I got my package almost two months BEFORE the expected delivery date. I&#x27;ll definitely buy from this seller again. These brushes will make a great addition to my cosmetology collection 💁</li>
    <li> t&#x27;was a gift. very happy young lady.</li>
    <li> Kind of has a weird smell but pretty decent.</li>
    <li> A lot to choose from, great brushes for contouring, and all kinds of different eyeshadow/liner looks. Very soft and are not cheap feeling or looking.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re lovely! But when I got them they smelled weird? But I was fine with it but the small fan brush was all nasty and the hairs were not straight when I got them 😓 but all in all they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> for cheap price expected them to be crappy, but they&#x27;re actually great.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re amazing! Wonderful quality!</li>
    <li> Came with a lot of brushes for a cheap price but they were&#x27;t good quality. Most broke within a few months of use. They are all basically the same brush so there isn&#x27;t much variety They don&#x27;t apply makeup smoothlly either awful if you are trying to blend or even just put on eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected- only thing was that when you open it, it smells like chemicals or whatever. This order didn&#x27;t come with a receipt!</li>
    <li> At first I was hesitant to order these brushes due to their unbelievable cheap price. A set like this could easily go for much more than it&#x27;s current sale price. I worried that they would fall apart and the materials would be cheap, but the brushes are soft and apply makeup easily and effortlessly. It shipped relatively quickly (roughly two weeks) and was worth every moment waiting.</li>
    <li> there are a lot of the same brushes but for the amount you get, the leather case, and the price.....you seriously can&#x27;t top it!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes i&#x27;m a hairdresser and these brushes are great to use at the salon.....</li>
    <li> A 4 star because (rarely) brush Brissels may fall out but other than that it is wonderful</li>
    <li> Just received this product this week &amp; I love it! It took a long time for it to come &amp; did have a strong smell to it, but the smell isn&#x27;t a deadly smell and goes away after a couple of hours. The brushes are good also they don&#x27;t shed! Love it &amp; recommend to all makeup lovers like myself!</li>
    <li> Defiantly not what I expected. The brushes are not the ones in the picture.</li>
    <li> Everything I thought it would be!</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice I unfortunately only received 31 brushes. The third from the right brush was missing.</li>
    <li> Horrible......sheds like crazy. I guess I got what I paid for. Maybe two or three brushes are good but the rest just suck!</li>
    <li> Every brush seems to be made VERY well made and a perfect gift for any girl or anyone learning to do makeup. The brushes are easy to clean which is really nice when you do makeup for a living. I have gotten so many compliments on it and happy with this make up brush set. I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> If you are into cosmetics and applying them professionally, these are the tools for you! The makeup flows like silk!</li>
    <li> This brush ate horrible I think my husband house painting brush are softer I had to throw them away bcs not even my sister wanted them for free</li>
    <li> The price is right..but the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; brushes shed a little bit every I use it.</li>
    <li> One brush was missing the bristles. You get what you pay for. Nice set for a beginner to destroy while experimenting.</li>
    <li> I read other comments before I ordered this product and although there were complaints of the hair falling out and it not being a good product, mine was great. I love this brush set so much!</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality.  The brushes are soft and easy to clean which is great. The variety of brushes make makeup application very easy.</li>
    <li> I líked it!  It is the same thing of the picture right there! It is so awesome! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> really good makeup brushes</li>
    <li> I love these brushes great for all styles</li>
    <li> Every brush you can ask for is in there. They feel good and do their job. Would def order it again.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Not a good brush set. I expected it not to be great since it is so cheap. But they are worse then expected. The bristles fall off all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the eye brushes are alright.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s good for starter but it falls apart easily I got to be careful</li>
    <li> Nice, over enough brushes just wish the name/purpose if the brush was written on it.</li>
    <li> Half of these brushes I would never even know what to use for. Only like 10 of them are useable and actually have a purpose</li>
    <li> Not even worth the money, trust me. Yeah you get a lot of brushes but I&#x27;d rather have quality over quantity.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them and the case. They are super cheap and perfect! Shipping took awhile tho but I&#x27;d buy them for gifts for sure</li>
    <li> The brushes look legit. Some work fine. But some poke you when applying your makeup and others leave hair behind. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> When I use the brushes, pieces of them are left on me face or eye lobs</li>
    <li> Nice quality, lots of variety</li>
    <li> At first I was nerves because of the price the product. I thought that it was risky that the quality wouldn&#x27;t be good. I&#x27;m honestly glad I took the risk. The case is good sustainable leather &amp; the brushed are smooth/soft working at perfection.</li>
    <li> great product i love it</li>
    <li> I have to rate a star in order to post a review and so that&#x27;s the only reason I give it a star at all. I placed these brushes on my wish list and my sister bought them for me as a gift so I can&#x27;t rate the timeliness of the shipping. When I went to use them, I immediately felt the difference between them and my mac/elf brushes. The bristles on theses brushes were synthetic and rough. They did not hold product in them at all and were not soft. I compare them to the flimsy brushes that come in the water colors kit. DO NOT BUY THESE. Spend the extra cash and get some mac or sephora brushes, they last up to 10 years so you really get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> They worked very well for a while and are a pretty good set for the price you pay. But mine started falling apart and the bristles started falling out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone who is looking for long term brushes, mi would maybe recommend them to a teenager starting out with makeup :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are garbage! Look I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist, but I have been a makeup geek for many years now. These brushes are terrible. Cheap, plastic, and stiff. Most of the brushes don&#x27;t have enough bristles or enough give in them, it&#x27;s like applying eyeshadow with a q-tip. They don&#x27;t bend at all. I know this kit offers a lot of brushes for a great price but take my advice - spend a little more money and get either the Coastal Scents or Shany. I&#x27;ve not tried Shany but the brushes have great reviews. But then again so did these crap brushes.... I personally love my Coastal Scents brushes, have been using them for 2 years now, just wanted to try something new.</li>
    <li> I am very happy but will have to wait for my daughters opinion as I am giving it as a gift</li>
    <li> Nice brushes, little shedding did not have the fullness that I was expecting</li>
    <li> Okay so the brushes weren&#x27;t so high quality... I mean come on your paying 15 bucks. Anyways I love everything about it. I use it for my Drag makeup. I especially love the case. All in all its a pretty good buy.</li>
    <li> These brushes are good not the best quality but work wonders. You can wash with baby shampoo and they will last</li>
    <li> I love these!!! They are soft and they do not shed!!! I am so happy!!! They arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Great brushes came quick.</li>
    <li> Buy went with no issue. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I got this for a girlfriend who is really big on makeup and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Most of these brushes are quite coarse and hurt my face when I use them. They also had a lot of brush fall out. The only brush I use is the fan brush for highlighter, which is pretty soft.</li>
    <li> Their awesome brushes and you get a variety of them and not to mention it didn&#x27;t take long to come to me</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and dont hold colors well. And the case smells horrible, like some kind of strong cleaning supply or something. Not really sure, there are alot of brushes that come in this, but as for working good... not so much</li>
    <li> I just got them today! Arrived super fast and they&#x27;re so pretty and work great I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Affordable, well made, and fun to use!</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes! So far I haven&#x27;t had had any problems with shedding, and they are super soft.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! For the price it&#x27;s more than awesome. Better than i expect. It came at time. Thanks!!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for this late review. I&#x27;m from Venezuela.</li>
    <li> Great for Gift.  Friend loves it.</li>
    <li> Love it ! They do smell like plastic a little but the smell goes away after a while.</li>
    <li> My daughter said that the brushes were really good but they came with a awful smell.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes but there is multiple of the same. And some of the hairs are falling out of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Literally such a great deal for such good brushes ! Only 2 of the bigger brushes had a few hairs fall out but that&#x27;s it :) they are very soft and sterty !</li>
    <li> Brushes are super stiff even after they were washed. Don&#x27;t hold color very well to apply</li>
    <li> Such an awesome find - I can&#x27;t believe how nice of quality these make up brushes were for the price. Organized and compact; I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> excelent product thanks</li>
    <li> A lovely package . Big sized and smells good ( yes the package smells really new ) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The items inside are well organised and different , all are packed in plastic and very classy thing .. It is a perfect gift for a lady .</li>
    <li> I had given it to my sister for a Christmas present &amp; she loves it !!! Recommend !!</li>
    <li> el producto es muy variado excelente compra para trabajar profesionalmente no tengo quejas la entrega llego a tiempo lo recomiiendo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in luv with these brushes!</li>
    <li> Excelent product and service. I&#x27;m so glad with my purchase. Lo compre desde Venezuela y me llego muy rapido, estoy bastante satisfecho con mi compra</li>
    <li> Pretty neat kit I bought here. A lot of brushes that I need to get used to! Unlike other reviewers, they don&#x27;t smell too bad. They smell a little like plastic but they were wrapped in plastic so what do you expect. Just spritz them with some rose water and they will be fine. They seem to work good though and are in a handy travel case. These will come in handy when I&#x27;m really trying to do my makeup!</li>
    <li> Very nice Brush Set. All as expected</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and thought these would be pretty good, the brushes are okay. But there are like 3 of the same ones which I was not super excited about. But if you want multiples of a brush so you can use one and then have one in your need to be cleaned pile then that wouldn&#x27;t be so bad. I was just not a fan of them.. there&#x27;s better brushes out there.</li>
    <li> i was really upset when i got these brushes. they dont give you all they show you and theyre not decent quality .</li>
    <li> this was a great buy, i use it all the time, tons of different sizes and shapes. a few are kinda cheap but i think there were only like 3 or so which i simply tossed out. some of then were kinda bent out of shape from the rolling but i got them wet and let them dry and they were just fine. im happy with it :)</li>
    <li> the only difficult its to learn how to use each brush</li>
    <li> Not bad, a few odd strands sticking out the end. For the price they are just fine.</li>
    <li> Nice brush set, looks exactly like the photo.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality bristles fell out before  ever used in many brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Best $20 I ever spent. They make my makeup look 20x better. When I need more will Def be buying from here and will be recommending these to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love love this product</li>
    <li> Brushes are super soft and better than I expected. Beyond worth the month. I know a lot of people said they shed but mine don&#x27;t and even if they did that&#x27;s fine because I have a very expensive Lancôme brush that also sheds. It&#x27;s very common.</li>
    <li> Very nice for such a low price.</li>
    <li> I was missing a couple brushes but other that, the brushes it&#x27;s self are okay for the little money I spent for them. So you should expect them cheap looking since you did but them for cheap.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS! and such a great price!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes feel nice and there is definetly a variety of them. The leather brush holder is nice, has a basic ribbon to secure. It smelled really plasticy though, hopefully once I wash them that will go away. I was irritated though when I was removing the plastic on the brushes when some of the handles came off! I&#x27;m going to have to super glue them back on. How embarrasing would that have been if that happened infront of a client.</li>
    <li> good buy for the price came with so many options love this item def. recommeneded for anyone who likes to mess w makeup</li>
    <li> They came in really fast and are really soft! I totally would buy again. They&#x27;re teally nice brushes and the handles are a nice matte black color.</li>
    <li> Large brushes are not high quality. They shed lots of hair!</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Not the best brushes but for the price you can&#x27;t really expect them to be. One of the bigger brushes had a lot of lose bristles. I will use these a lot and might try a different product next time. I&#x27;m just getting really into makeup and also don&#x27;t want to spend $100+ on just brushes. These will serve the purpose.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much and wasn&#x27;t surprised. The brush quality is very inexpensive. I just use them to feel my brush collection but never actually use them.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes thinking they were gonna be a hit or a miss, since thats what most of the reviews were stating. My brushes personally, weren&#x27;t that bad, however they weren&#x27;t the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought. The positives were that there were a large quantity of them, and they work well. The negatives were that a lot of the brushes were shedding and it was quiet annoying. Also one of my brushes broke when I merely picked it up, so it shows they are low quality. However, for the price of 32 brushes, the quality seemed pretty fitting. I give them a 3, because the pricing was good but the quality wasnt that great</li>
    <li> I love my new brush set! Each brush is packaged separately, and has a cover on the brush hairs and handle. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell when you open them. It smells kinda like burned plastic. But overall I cant wait to use them for tons of events!</li>
    <li> Spoke to seller we are coming to a conclusion On small misunderstanding super fast shipping looking forward to buying merchandise again! A++++</li>
    <li> THE BEST BRUSHES EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: The hair don&#x27;t fall out even after a llloooonnnngggg time of using it. and they are really strong and they don&#x27;t break and everything is perfect about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRUSH: IT is so perfect. it doesn&#x27;t make me feel itchy, don&#x27;t hurt my face and perfectly applies the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance: It looks elegant and beautiful. Black is really great.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re  just different sizes of a basic concealer brush. Nothing special. They don&#x27;t blend, they don&#x27;t pick up my eyeshadow, they don&#x27;t even place my eyeshadow correctly. I regret buying this. It&#x27;s just sitting inside a drawer. Use your money on something nicer.</li>
    <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t that bad. I sprayed the pouch they came in with air freshner and laid them outside for a few hours to air out and now they smell fine. The brushes work great. I was hoping that there would be a fluffy blending brush for eyeshadow instead of all the little brushes but they work fine and blend well, you just have to work with them. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes so I would not have to use my personal brushes when doing makeup for others. These brushes are not worth the money at al . They shed and do not pick up product well. They are pokey and rough. I would not reccoment them to anyone. If you want to spend money on good brushed without spending too much check out the BESTOP brand 8 or 10 piece brush set they are amazing sigma dupes.. I guess these brushes would be okay for a beginner practicing or someone that doesn&#x27;t use makeup often</li>
    <li> Did have a paint like scent, but after cleaning them. They are fine</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect and affordable, i love them! They don&#x27;t shed and can be cleaned easily.</li>
    <li> The brushes came very fast and that was very exciting! The bag that hold the brushes smells like paint, but that&#x27;s all goes away after a few minutes. overall the brushes are all great quality and I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase and I recommend it to everyone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of money and wants nice quality make up brushes!</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes let me tell you at first I was very excited to use them but they are very bad quality the only usable ones are the ones for eyeshadow the bigger brushes are very stiff and feels like a bad material I guess you do get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Brushes are great. Only problem I had was that the bristles in one of the brushes came completely out. So I&#x27;m one less brush, but other than that. They&#x27;re as expected.</li>
    <li> Love all the brushes, but wish they provided a list of what each brush is typically for...for the new to the makeup world people like me;)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I can easily see the bristles are very stiff and looks poorly made, def. would have some shedding with this. but like I said for the price its good and they are a lot of brushes you can get good use of.</li>
    <li> I love everyone review and look very much fowared in reading them but my quesion is has anyone here faces ichy or bake outs by useing this products also have they fallin out after useing in a while question cause iam intrested and i and dont want that to afeact my face no at all especialy my face is very combination/oily skin please reply soon before i shop this</li>
    <li> I love that these makeup brush set comes with a variety of makeup brushes I have every one I need Thanks</li>
    <li> The smell is kind of overwhelming at first but it fades out eventually. If you wash the brushes before you use them, it&#x27;ll  be fine. All of the loose bristles will fall out and they&#x27;ll work. Some of them are pointless, I&#x27;m not going to really use them, but overall, the purchase was worth the money.</li>
    <li> Lots of brushes.  Really more than I need but it was a good price.  The brush handles are way too long for comfort.  The brush hairs fall out constantly - I have to pick hairs off of my face as I&#x27;m doing my makeup.</li>
    <li> The brushes are already falling apart. As I&#x27;m applying makeup the bristles of the brush are falling off on my face. Not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture, the brushes themselves aren&#x27;t that great. Shed a lot and don&#x27;t grab the makeup very well. Break very easily.</li>
    <li> All brushes are usable.&lt;br /&gt;There are only 2 of the larger face brushes that shed. After cleaning them though they aren&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;There are some duplicates of eye brushes</li>
    <li> The best brushes ever.</li>
    <li> my wif loved them till she got a rash and now looks like she has chicken pox from using them</li>
    <li> not  good just open it and already the brush are falling apart .. not a happy but u get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I got my brushes today and they are horrible. The brush Hair is really hard and rough. The brushes are really bad that you can&#x27;t even use on you&#x27;re face and it stinks like plastic. I rather buy one nice brush for $20 then to buy  something I&#x27;m never going to use. The brushes will leave lines on you&#x27;re face because the quality is horrible. All the brushes are not even the same color and I&#x27;m missing a brush. Yes they are cheap but don&#x27;t bother wasting you&#x27;re money on this item. You won&#x27;t be happy.</li>
    <li> To be honest they suck... They don&#x27;t apply makeup that great... I just want to get a different set if that&#x27;s possible... I just don&#x27;t like them... I rather by a different set</li>
    <li> the second day I opened the brushes and started to clean them one of the brushes broke apart as I was cleaning them. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Sort of smells like plastic. But, just wash and they are fine.</li>
    <li> They are just great for the price.. great deal</li>
    <li> I love these brushes so much i use them on the dead bodies i have in my room when i want to give them makeovers.</li>
    <li> These are nice brushes.  Case is very nice too</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. They are soft and do have a slight plastic new smell to them, but they are wrapper in a faux leather casing, so I was not surprised at the smell. I was all  brushes I buy anyways, considering you do not know where they have been in the factory. It was not an issue to wash the brushes. Once washed they no longer have a smell to them.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of brushes, and figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to get an extra set. If you&#x27;re looking for a good product, look elsewhere. Mine came with a broken brush, and when I emailed them they told me to contact them through Amazon.. Obviously if I bought them off amazon, that&#x27;s how I contacted you! They then said they &amp;#34;couldn&#x27;t find&amp;#34; my order. Whatever, I wasted perfectly good money on brushes that don&#x27;t transfer product well at all. The large brushes aren&#x27;t dense enough to do anything! The only thing I&#x27;ve used is the eyebrow one and even then it&#x27;s not what it should be.</li>
    <li> These brushes don&#x27;t work at all. I was excited to order them and when they finally arrived i opened them to find the brushes losing hairs and some of them were pointing in different directions..i ignored it though and still used them to discover they dont pick up any pigment of your eyeshadow either they don&#x27;t work at all, dont buy these brushes.</li>
    <li> Its product is the better! Its very good. I recommend to buy it without a doubt. You will not regret</li>
    <li> Really good for the price. The case is but cute... I&#x27;ve not experienced any shedding do that&#x27;s a plus. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m soooooo in love with these brushes. As soon as they came I played in makeup with my roommate so we could get ready for our show. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because one of the bigger brushes began shedding but has since stopped and I use it regularly just as I do the others. I haven&#x27;t tried to clean them yet but I&#x27;m hoping I won&#x27;t have any problems cleaning them. Overall I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re a pretty good buy.</li>
    <li> Im in love with it☺😀😊😍</li>
    <li> Expected better quality!</li>
    <li> The brushes are basically you get what you pay for. Some of the brushes had damage but nothing major. However shipping was longer than expected and they took forever to be shipped out. These brushes are great for someone just starting out but definitely not used by professionals. Hopefully these last!</li>
    <li> These brushes are seriously amazing. They&#x27;re super soft, and the handles are long and easy to maneuver. I love this brush set!</li>
    <li> Love th3 smaller brushes but the bigger brushes shed alot and r hard to clean</li>
    <li> I love how many brushes there are. There are several that are repeats, but that&#x27;s okay. Feel a lot better after washing with shampoo and conditioner to soften the hairs.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Metal does not separate from the handle like other cheap brushes. Very soft and sleek black case. I love it. &#x27;</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes with just enough softness to be gentle on your skin, but still pack on product! I would recommend them to anyone who is starting a makeup collection or someone who is looking for a set of all the brushes you need! Perfect condition and very nice looking carrying bag. Smells a bit weird when they first arrive, but the smell is gone within a day or two!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item hoping it would ship faster than an item I purchased earlier this month. I must say I was dissapointed. There is a large variety of brushes in this set, but majority of them are not useful. The brissles on the larger burshes fall out frequently, leaving pieces all over my face. The eyeshadow brushes are synthetic and dont pick up much color. They also DO NOT blend well. I am now going to have to purchase another set of cosmetic burshes because these were a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Brushes suck. The bristles are to rough and they  all broke off the handle. Never again. No wonder they&#x27;re so cheap.</li>
    <li> Horrible Brushes!!-Shed bristles all over my face and not just one or two bristles but 20-30 in the first use.  Don&#x27;t waste money on these!</li>
    <li> The brushes are not soft at all. My case fell apart when I opened it! The brushes had hairs coming off on the bigger ones and shedding so badly. I was really excited about getting these. They all look synthetic too. When I was blending my foundation, I looked in the mirror and had the bristles all over my face and I&#x27;m not exaggerating.</li>
    <li> The brushes are okay, but they do shed a lot .</li>
    <li> These brushes are so fine! I love them all! I didn&#x27;t expect them to be this great, thank you so much!!! :)</li>
    <li> Brushes are nice quality for beginners. Comes with a nice case which you could place all the brushes and they all have its own little space. Very nicely packaged! I like the brushes for eye shadow they are a great size and it makes it easy to place an all other the eye lid color with them. They are really nice people to work with. If you have any question or need help with anything they are always kind and understanding and wont mind answering any questions; great service. Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Brush set arrived quickly, smelled like plastic but it isnt a big deal. The brushes were neatly covered with plastic. I am really pleased with the brushes.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price, you get a million brushes. The only thing is I wished there were more eyeliner brushes, I thought there would be a few at least so some of these I will probably never use. Good bargain though, they seem pretty sturdy so far.</li>
    <li> It is more of a matter of quantity as opposed to variety of sizes in terms of brushes. Other bruah kits are better and more variate.</li>
    <li> perfect item I like it very good quality</li>
    <li> HAD A TERRIBLE SMELL TO IT. I DID GET HALF OF MY MONEY BACK BUT WOULD NOT ORDER AGAIN.. THREW THE CASE OUT AND HAD TO SOAK THE BRUSHES</li>
    <li> It was worth getting this its all great:)!i liked it all all the brushes work good nd r very soft.</li>
    <li> THEY&#x27;RE OK QUALITY NOT VERY GOOD</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it much but the bristles feel soft and very little shedding. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes were very disappointing! The 2 big brushes are very scratchy and hurt my face. Not worth it,they shed too:/ felt like a brillow pad,not worth it,search real horse hair if you are looking for a nice set,there is a blue one,they are very soft and well worth it!</li>
    <li> I have also seen people complain about the smell and the brush hairs falling out. But it is all minimal. And once you start using it daily it will smell like your makeup and the little stray hairs will go away. If you want a perfect brush kit then just get a pro kit that is expensive. Otherwise this is perfect for starting out with makeup and learning techniques.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  This was purchased as a starter set for someone, and while they love it, I can tell that it isn&#x27;t the best quality.  I would say buy one of two good brushed before purchasing this.  It&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s definitely not the best.</li>
    <li> Great I love these brushes</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and person loved it. Plenty of brushes</li>
    <li> my wife love these brushes</li>
    <li> I liked the price its why i got them but... was didn&#x27;t like the quality of them they are hard and not soft at all but that&#x27;s what you get for the price but if you are trying to learn to use makeup for the first time these they are okay.</li>
    <li> good for price but the brushes are a little coarse...</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes for professional use!</li>
    <li> Yes it did thanks a lot !</li>
    <li> great product excellent price...</li>
    <li> its a great price for all the brushes you get. however I bought this because I wanted all the brushes for eyeshadow. if you&#x27;re wanting to buy this kit for the face brushes, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. the face brushes in mine have hairs falling out, and they&#x27;re not very soft. but I love the eye brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes bristles were very rough on my skin and the bristles came off on my face every time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very poor quality sad to say I will not order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Affordable brushes to use in my makeup class.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and the brushes were beautiful!!! LLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE IIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone who have a passion for makeup!!!</li>
    <li> Brush shed and don&#x27;t keep the shape! All the fluffy brushes shed. It took more time removing brush hairs from my face than applying my makeup</li>
    <li> Exactly what my 16 yr old wanted</li>
    <li> Got these in the mail and I was so impressed by them that I had to write a review - not something that I normally do. I didn&#x27;t notice a smell at all, and the brushes are soft and really (especially for the price) well made. On the 32 piece, the price is approx. 48 cents a brush - try finding that good of a deal elsewhere. I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding, but I have only used some of them, and only once.</li>
    <li> I was VERY Spectical to buy this I usually buy my brushes from BH Cosmetics but I was on a budget I had lost both of my BH cosmetics brush sets so I order this and its AMAZING I LOVE IT!!!!!! The brushes are great love how they work yeah they have a smell but it went away I RECOMMEND 100% !</li>
    <li> Love love the brushes . Didnt have any type of funky smell. Pick up wet or dry product up perfect . For the price its a must.</li>
    <li> Love them but the case had a weird smell</li>
    <li> Get price , came in great timing just to many of the sand brushes wasn&#x27;t really feeling that</li>
    <li> Nice, but a lot of repeated brushes.</li>
    <li> Almost too many brushes to choose from there are so many in this collection.</li>
    <li> Decent product, The eye brushes work well but they shed pretty fast, The face brushes dont seem to hold alot of product. Not a bad kit</li>
    <li> the brushes are not soft enough. will not buy them again</li>
    <li> Love my brushes and going to order more soon</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, exactly what it says in the description. Great product for a great price, not the best quality brushes but are good. Gave as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it. Perfect for day to day. The brushes are soft, nice wide selection of different brushes to learn.</li>
    <li> I am happy that it was a brand new make-up brush set, but two days after I started using them I noticed that the brushes was starting to shed. Every time I tried to put the eye shadow on my eyelid,there goes a piece of the brush on my eyelid. I would&#x27;ve gave this product 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t experience the shedding. Yes there are 32 bushes but the shedding is not something that I was expecting. Which is why I gave this product 2 stars only because the set was brand new.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for someone so I haven&#x27;t used them myself. When they came in the mail though the case had an awful chemical smell. They also look low quality. I can&#x27;t speak for how the brushes are but the case looked used and cheap.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived earlier than expected. They&#x27;re super soft and hold up really well.</li>
    <li> When I bought these brushes I was happy. Now I don&#x27;t like these brushes. The hair are coming out!!!  NOT A HAPPY GIRL!!!!</li>
    <li> They are a good quality brush but they had a very strong plasticky smell and I&#x27;m hoping that they get aired out before Christmas.</li>
    <li> Its a nice brush set for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> I give this item 2 stars only because for one, one of the brushes broke off immediately, the metal part come off of the stick part. Also, as I was looking through the brushes, I noticed that they appear to be 2 set combined. The actual brush part appears to be very different on some of them, different color and texture. Some feel real silky soft, and some feel real course and stiff. Lastly, the different names of the brushes are not on the stick. To many, this will not matter, but I like to have the names on them so  If I am working on someone and I say hand me the blending brush, I want them to be able to find it without holding each one up saying &amp;#34;is this it.&amp;#34; (seems very unprofessional). On the bright side, considering the price of this set, and how much others cost, it was worth the price. I do really like the carrying pouch for them.</li>
    <li> Im in love! After recently finding makeup interesting I needed a good set of brushes and these are definitely them.</li>
    <li> Perfect for pros and begginers. I don&#x27;t do makeup professionally  I do hope I will soon. Easy to clean easy to use. Very fine brushes for less than 35 bucks.</li>
    <li> All kinds of brushes. Now I can do my make up like a professional also they feel very soft on my skin. They are good for their price.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail and they look very good quality and feel great😁</li>
    <li> I got my package today which I was very excited about!! But when I opened it up it was missing brushes from the package...I don&#x27;t know wether to return the product or not..</li>
    <li> They arrived on time and I love them! Use them in daily use and for special occasions. They are an excellent array of tools that are extremely useful.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend LOVED these brushes</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice--very soft and, of course, there are a LOT of them--but they come with a really weird plastic-y smell.</li>
    <li> I love anything beauty related but I was so excited to get these brushes and play around in makeup! Then I had to remember these days makeup can be pretty expensive so I&#x27;m taking it easy! I haven&#x27;t quite used all of my brushes yet but we&#x27;re getting there. They are decent quality which really surprised me. For the price I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what I would receive but I happy I ordered them. They don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re ready to fall apart but the real test comes when I wash them. For now they work great I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!</li>
    <li> 1 broke...but other than that. ..I love it!</li>
    <li> Not happy with brushes. They smell awful. Poor quality.  I guess i paid $ for the poor quality. Still using my M.A.C.brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brushes with limited to no shedding. This was a great buy for a makeup newbie like me!</li>
    <li> Love these! Got them for my Sis.</li>
    <li> Honestly disappointed, the fan brush is all jacked up, the face brushes are all shedding and I just got them and took a look, the eye brushes look and fell all the same, not like the picture and description</li>
    <li> I was kinda worried for a few weeks until I got my brushes because I was thinking that probably it didn&#x27;t come with 32 pieces of it because sometimes amazon things on here is a lie but when i finally receive my sets it came out to be really 32 sets of it and it was really happy about and just started to use them everyday. They are all nice and smooth nothing wrong.😇</li>
    <li> they fall apart as you use them.</li>
    <li> Good if you don&#x27;t wash your brushes often or for professionals who have multiple faces to do in a short amount of time. Multiples of the same brush</li>
    <li> Some brushes look better than others. The pouch smells very bad.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this brushes went straight to the trash can. Don&#x27;t buy this unless you&#x27;re going to give them to your little girls to play. Don&#x27;t waste your shipping money and your time!!!</li>
    <li> The hairs fall out on them like crazy! and they give you so many unnecessary eye brushes! DO NOT BUY THIS! IT SUCKS.</li>
    <li> Great shipping and my wife loved the price.</li>
    <li> I love it its perfect every tool I need in makeup I have it now! :)</li>
    <li> Overall this is not a bad set of brushes.For the price I think it was worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice, i love using them every day. Going to buy other set for my mother and my sisters.</li>
    <li> Hard to clean brushes after use</li>
    <li> Shedding brushes. Disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> this was one of the few gifts my daughter wanted for Christmas.  Can&#x27;t tell you how happy she is</li>
    <li> As soon as I open I package and took the pastic cover off each brush about 5 of them broke. I was extremely disappointed. And on top of that they shed terribly.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter, and she loves it. Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> smaller brushes are great, As they get bigger they really shed to much hair.... kind of pointless to buy! nobody wants brushes that shred right away not for the price they have them for...</li>
    <li> I am pleased with these brushes. I received them within the estimated delivery date. The brushes are beautifully and sturdily made. I have used them for a couple of week now and they still work. I would highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes a lot. They came 3 days early! They are a very good buy for the price! They work great and pick up the makeup just right!</li>
    <li> Nice set with soft brushes. Case is very handy and brushes are of good variety. Great for experimenting or beginner practice. I&#x27;m on a budget but needed new brushes. These are perfect. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is one brush had a hard glue stuck to the end of the hairs in one spot. I hope I can get it out but if I can&#x27;t at least thats only one brush and not every single one.</li>
    <li> I pulled the plastic off the biggest brush and the top part fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All brushes have hairs falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT a good product!!</li>
    <li> They shed horribly. There are maybe four brushes that do not shed. They also are extremely hard to clean. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Too many repeated brushes. Some were unnecessary and too much shedding. Quality isn&#x27;t thaaat great but it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> Excellent price, I really happy with this.</li>
    <li> I was very haply recieving these. They arrived on tome, werw packaged with care, and rach brush was individually wrapped in plastic. So im appreciative of that. Also, they are sosoft, and didnt have a weird smell or anything. Didn&#x27;t make me break out ipon use, and stand up well after cleaning. :) great product.</li>
    <li> pretty gd for so cheap . brush hairs come off alot tho</li>
    <li> All the brushes are harsh on my skin and leave hairs behind. I Wish I could take this purchase back.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT SO MUCH! Im new to makeup and this is great to have for every day use.</li>
    <li> Meh. I didn&#x27;t pay much for this set, so I didn&#x27;t think I would be getting all that great quality, but I bought them anyway to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with many many brushes, in a plastic fold up carrier. To be honest you can really tell the lack of quality when it comes to the larger brushes, shedding and no quality to the shape, so I tossed most of those almost immediately. I ended up keeping most of the smaller style brushes. They do come in handy on occasion when I need to apply something unusual that I don&#x27;t apply everyday on a new brush. They are not my every day brushes but I do use them on occasion, and it is nice to have brushes like that around you can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In hind sight, I think its better to spend a little more money on a nicer set with less brushes. The quantity doesn&#x27;t really make up for lack of quality here.</li>
    <li> Honestly these are horrible ! There not worth buy I just received mine they have a bad Oder . Shed a lot most of the brushes are simillar I regret buying this product !</li>
    <li> When my brushes came in I was super exited! But then I looked at them and I got even more exited!! The first brush I took out was the fan brush, it had broke! I then tested them, I was not very impressed. The brushes shed, they are very hard, and they break easily!!!!! Won&#x27;t be buying for anyone or as gifts!</li>
    <li> Very affordable and impressed with the number of brushes in this case.</li>
    <li> they stink, so many unnecessary brushes. they shed way too much, the feel was horrible. they left me with a burning sensation. never will buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought for so many brushes at a good . Price these were going to be cheap. I hate brushes thAt leave there bristles on your face. Really liked these.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved the great variety of the brushes, but when used, they will leave little bristles all over the place.</li>
    <li> While the brushes are AMAZING, I only got 29 brushes in. :(</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for these brushes but I&#x27;m shopping for different ones. The foundation and powder brushes are extremely itchy. I was hoping for soft bristles and these are not it. It literally feels like they are scratching my face when I use them. They also shed crazy. I may be able to use some of the eye brushes but I just don&#x27;t like how they are super stiff.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very stiff, making it hard for me to use them easily.</li>
    <li> love-a lot for a good price</li>
    <li> Not the best quality brushes, but they work</li>
    <li> just okay. breakage. scratchy. works in a pinch. but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> all in good condition , thanks</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about them. I love makeup and am very picky about using certain brushes for certain things, but just about all of these brushes are flat and do not hold product very well. There&#x27;s only 3 brushes in that kit that I actually use. Wasn&#x27;t really worth the money!</li>
    <li> 90% of these brushes are crap. If you are serious about makeup at all, this is not a set even worth trying. Not only do they shed like crazy, the bristles are also incredibly rough and do not apply product well at all. The flat dome eye shadow brushes and the spooly are pretty much the only brushes that are even remotely usable out of this set. Honestly, a brush set I got from WalMart during christmas time was 100x better quality than these. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for looks and they get the job done but they definitely shed! I took that risk looking at other reviews but ordered anyway. I will continue to use these but may switch back to my cheaper purple ombre brushes I have from a prior purchase months ago.</li>
    <li> Oh my god, these brushes are TERRIBLE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Thank god for free returns &amp; USPS pick up. I ordered these brushes expecting to get black brushes with soft fluffy brown bristles, that is NOT what I was sent. Some brushes were black with redish-brown bristles the others were black with tacky straw-looking yellow bristles. The smell of these brushes was HORRIBLE and they felt so rough. I was also missing 2-3 as i counted 29 instead of 32. The shedding on the brushes I WAS sent was horrible and there were multiple duplicates.</li>
    <li> I BELIEVE EVERY GIRL THATS INTO MAKE UP LIK HOW I AM, NEEDS A WIDE SELECTION OF DIFFERENT BRUSHES TO PLAY WITH IM STILL LEARNING SO THE PRICE WAS PERFECT ONCE I GO PRO THEN I WILL GET THE REAL DEAL BUT FOR NOW THIS IS G\THE CLOSEST THING TO IT AND ITS WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> My makeup is beautiful with the use of these brushes! Yes!!!! Love! Love! Love! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> good price nice product</li>
    <li> All hard bristles cannot use half of what was in the bag it didn&#x27;t come with a summary of what the brushes are called</li>
    <li> Brushes are stiff I don&#x27;t like and won&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> They are really good and soft brushes but they smell when they come but other then that good brushes</li>
    <li> Really nice for the pice</li>
    <li> Item arrived very fast and was of great quality, my daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> Great my daughter love it.. Thanks</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay quality.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes and so does my daughter because now I can make her look like anna</li>
    <li> I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop. Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft, and amazing! They are great quality- MAC and BareMinerals quality. Too many brushes to even count, I am so happy I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, but one of the brushes was broken</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because I thought they would be an inexpensive way to get good quality makeup brushes. The package smelled a little like paint thinner, and the brushes are of poor quality. Worst part is the scratch your face up. But I liked the pouch they came in, for the money I guess they ok.</li>
    <li> Not the best, but good enough &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Like most girls I wanted every make up brush in existence, even though I know how to use maybe four.&lt;br /&gt;This was a price I was willing to pay, even comes with a handy dandy roll. The brushes are good quality, no loose parts falling out, they maintain their shape and I know how to use like 70% of them now.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft &amp; easily to handle. make sure that you wash they before using them. The best way to wash them out is using baby shampoo.</li>
    <li> Not very soft, so makeup does not stick very well and cannot be applied to my face.</li>
    <li> OMG THESE BRUSHES ARE HORRIBLE!!! I&#x27;VE ORDERED BRUSHES FROM AMAZON AND USUALLY USE THE REVIEWS TO FIND OUT WHAT IS GOOD, THIS TIME THE REVIEWS FAILED ME. FOR ONE THE BIG BRUSHES WERE NOT SOFT THEY WERE SCRATCHY AND HARD. THE BRUSHES ALSO SHED A LOT!!!! BIG CLUMPS OF HAIR WERE COMING OUT AT ONCE....I HAD TO TRIM THE BRUSHES BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT EVEN AT ALL.......OVERALL THIS ORDER WAS A MISTAKE, THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN SAY GOOD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT WAS THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF VARIETY IN THE BRUSHES</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Came fast. Brushes are too soft for pro.</li>
    <li> Got my brushes in the mail today. Smelled like paint. Brushes are so cheap. I really shouldve read the reviews first. All the brushes are repeats just different sizes. The brush holder is cute though... Definately give these brushes a thumbs down.</li>
    <li> Their great!!! Im to get a second set for my personal use. The hair in the brushes is good quality and the hairs hold eyeshadow well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the texture of the brushes. not soft at all :(</li>
    <li> My only complaint would be that one of the brushes seemed shoved in a spot with another brush without the protective covering. The bristles are now bent and distorted.</li>
    <li> I chose that I liked it because on of the pieces was broken ... And it came before it was required</li>
    <li> Such a good deal for so many brushes. So glad I bought this</li>
    <li> They arrived on time but the quality is not the best. They shed quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I love the variety of the brushes and the design along with the materials used, but my brushes, especially the large ones, shed something fierce. Is this normal for the price, or did I get special brushes?</li>
    <li> Works verry well super soft</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a must buy. the bristles are soft and they came well protected. I can&#x27;t wait to get my make up on now :-)</li>
    <li> They came in so quickly! The quality is decent for the price, with much variety of brushes. I just wish it included a smaller fluffier blending brush but besides that it&#x27;s great. It does have a strong smell when you first open the package but quickly goes away.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes , everything came really fast and just a couple looked a bit differently then the rest but it doesn&#x27;t matter , I can&#x27;t wait to try these on my face ! Recommend buying these ! I&#x27;m a beginner on make up and I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with these brushes. I almost don&#x27;t want to use them because they are just so beautiful &amp; soft !</li>
    <li> I like these brushes a lot. They came 3 days early! They are a very good buy for the price!</li>
    <li> Brushes are a little stiff but you are getting what you pay for. I didn&#x27;t expect them to be perfect, but they sure work for now and as far as bristles and if they fall out, mine haven&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Just got this in and cant wait to use it since I needed some for modeling. Im excited because they came in like days before it was even suppose to come in! I Love it!! If you need make up brushes, and need them in a good time, I do HIGHLY RECOMMEND this item and the company!!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed  of the Bush set the bristols are falling out.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t very soft</li>
    <li> It came nice and meet.. I was very pleased with it only thing i dislike is the shedding which was very minimum. Hopefully it will stay the same after i clean my brushes...</li>
    <li> The product came in smelling like imitation leather, the bristles fall out and are hard to get off your face. The only good part was that it shipped in a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> Love this! The only complaint I have is that on the brushes with the red tips the bristles fall out. Other than that I love it!</li>
    <li> Got tho for my friend that has recently dove head first in to the make up land! It&#x27;s got a huge variety and are pretty nice for the coast I have got to say one of every thing and then some !</li>
    <li> These brushes are my life. Like they work wonderfully. Definitely will buy again</li>
    <li> Excellent my daughter loves them</li>
    <li> The shedding is extremely bad - they look cheap.  The handle broke off of two brushes after two days....you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> the hairs of the brushes comeout</li>
    <li> I received the brushes this evening and as soon as I opened them I realized I&#x27;d wasted my money. All of the face brushes are rough. I personally don&#x27;t like rough brushes AT ALL. So seeing that they were supposed to be &#x27;&#x27;elegant&#x27;&#x27; really sadden me. The eye brushes are very soft, but they all look the same to me. They all have the same &amp;#34;fullness&amp;#34; to the hairs so I couldn&#x27;t blend with a very dense brush. Would not repurchase, would rather spend a little more money on Coastal Scents brushes that are worth the money and affordable.</li>
    <li> If you need need makeup brushes that are nice, then yes.. order them! Great price too. I read other reviews that say they smell.. and they do, but only until you get them out of the package. It doesn&#x27;t even smell gross. It smells like when you sniff a Sharpie.</li>
    <li> Obsessed !!!! I love it</li>
    <li> Bristles were scratchy and not well made.</li>
    <li> Brush hair was so hard and started falling off after the few use.</li>
    <li> I love this set. Such great quality for such a cheap price. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Awful set, wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, brushes were either to stiff and rough on skin and or not full enough to carry the product and apply to surface without losing said product from pallet to skin surface.</li>
    <li> Good price, good quality!</li>
    <li> The brush quality sucks and after one use, the brush hairs come apart. I expected better. It&#x27;s even hard to clean the brushes</li>
    <li> Leather case smells like paint .. Not to bad for the price but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that hair synthetic hairs fall off the brush like crazy!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy with product at all concealer does not blend well , made me look like I was in a casket.</li>
    <li> Aside from the smell when I first opened-- I love these brushes! They are affordable and great for makeup-- I love make up and tend to use them a lot! Great for a novice artist as well!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. There are brushes in case that do the job.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very hard. Too rough for my face. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Great brush set Especially for the price. I love them.</li>
    <li> i thought it was christmas all over again daughter loves them</li>
    <li> i like it! pretty cool product good quality!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this brushes , and it turns out to be that they not that good there okay for starters.  They don&#x27;t pick up that much product.</li>
    <li> Love it my professional kit</li>
    <li> I recieve my order on the day it says it&#x27;ll arrive. It does have a smell, it smells like brand new leather, I would recomend to wash the brushes first. I did see a little bit of chip on one of the brushes just one and on the other it had like only 2 hairs fall out on one of the brush. But for 32 brushes for $15 wow that&#x27;s a lot cheap for a really nice pro brushes. I like them all and I recomend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> These are nice however you get exactly what you pay for. I&#x27;ve had them less than a year and they wear out quickly. Some have even fallen apart. Overall, I do like how the work and glide easy.</li>
    <li> the brushes are super soft and a great quality for the price</li>
    <li> They arrived the day ut said, they are a little rough but they get the job done it comes with every brush needed for a full face makeup...</li>
    <li> Loveeeee these brushes</li>
    <li> The brushes are good for the price.  Great bristle which does not shed, however the wooden part of the brush is not properly attached and from the set one, one fell apart.  A little improvement in this minor glitch would make this a wonderful set to have.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with these brushes. The quality of the brushes are way beyond what I&#x27;d expected. The shipping was very fast. The product was well packaged. I&#x27;ve used them several times and have washed them and they are holding up very nicely. HIGHLY recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my purchase, thank you!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes, only one brush out of the whole set came a little loose. Other then that it is great !!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I absolutely love this, this was totally worth the purchase. I had less than hairs from shedding, from less than 5 brushes out of 32. I thinks that&#x27;s pretty good, and they&#x27;re decent quality brushes. These brushes are really worth it.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. The brushes are very stiff. They don&#x27;t hold eye shadow every well. no blending brush.... well one that works nicely anyways. . But for the price it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Bristles come off really easy. Hard to clean</li>
    <li> Excellent received in Good condition</li>
    <li> Most of the brushes are made very cheap. You get what you pay for. Also a lot of the brushes are practically the same exact brush. The hair in the brushes in very low quality. I do enjoy the fan brushes but other than that there were very few useful brushes.</li>
    <li> I was floored when I got this product. The brushes are high-quality and the roll feels just like leather! This is one hundred percent worth the investment- it&#x27;s not a splurge, it&#x27;s a STEAL.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas but it was such a GREAT deal I bought myself one too.</li>
    <li> Great Brush Set. so much brushes for the money!! Recommend!!</li>
    <li> Good brushes, inexpensive and good quality! I&#x27;d recommend</li>
    <li> From the time I was a child I wanted a set of real cosmetic brushes. As time went on, I just could not ever seem to afford one. I would see these awesome sets in the stores and never have the money for them, they were just not in my price range. Then one day, strolling through the wonderful Amazon, I stumbled across this set of super cheap, SUPER AWESOME brushes. It was the largest set I found, the cheapest as well. When I got them, I took them all out, inspected them, played with them for a while to get a good feel of them and their uses. In comparison to those pricey brushes I see in the store, these are just as good if not better even than some brands out there. I recommend use of these brushes. So many ways to play with your colors inside this roll. All brushes come enclosed in their own plastic wrappings tucked into pockets in the roll. For a few of the larger brushes, there is a thicker plastic sleeve to protect the brush bristles, which is an excellent idea and I use the sleeves still. The bristles are super soft, they hold the product, no matter the texture or consistency(ie blush vs foundation) very well, and allow for an even application rather nicely. I love my new brushes.</li>
    <li> I was undecided between spending $40 on two MAC eyes shadow brushes, or this set for less than half... I&#x27;m happy i gave these a try, they are far from MAC but they get the job done. There&#x27;s so many of them I have one brush for every color of eye shadow, liner, or powder, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning them to use another color. It also saves me some time in the mornings. I have used them for about a two months now and there is not sign of the brissles falling out, and I use these everyday.</li>
    <li> Item as described fast shipping</li>
    <li> I would be buying another one next week or even sooner. Great gift for a person that loves makeup!</li>
    <li> Well the actual package arrived pretty early which I was a bit shocked and upon opening there was a strong smell of plastic/chemicals but after wiping the  bag down and cleaning the brushes it went away. Don&#x27;t really have any problems like some of the other reviewers reported. The brushes are alright, I don&#x27;t find much use for a few of them but the eyeshadow ones work decently in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Overall not the BEST set around and spending a good $30+ on a nice set of brushes would more then likely be worth it, but if you&#x27;re a beginner or just need some extra spare brushes and not looking to spend alot then buying these is a nice choice.&lt;br /&gt;**You have to realize this set was only 19.99 so it&#x27;s not like you would be getting some fantastic brushes. Like the saying go, \\&quot;You get what you payed for\\&quot;, and with that being said I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The hairs on the brushes keep falling out. I regret ever buying them. I had bought Shany brushes before and I loved it I thought to try another brand but I was WRONG and should of never done it.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> this product is pretty good, i thought there would be a blending brush and duo brush but either way, its still pretty good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few brushes, but love them</li>
    <li> Had to return the product, as it was really bad.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my seventeen year old, who is a makeup nut. Suffice it to say, she LOVED it. It came fast and was exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Great brushes great price good quality. Doesn&#x27;t get better than that</li>
    <li> I was worried they would be cheaply made, but they are actually great brushes!!! If you are starting out your brush collection I 100% recommend these!</li>
    <li> Extremely low quality. All the hairs fell off as soon as I opened it. I&#x27;m returning this, its ridiculous.Its not even the same as the picture. Completely different product!</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. I love that I have the complete set. The brushes are not the softest on the market but they do get the job done. I love the leather case that holds it.</li>
    <li> Okay if they were a bit stiffer it would be nice</li>
    <li> mine are soft and came with all 32 so I&#x27;m happy so far. they&#x27;re no kabooki brushes but they&#x27;re really good considering how many you get for such a low price. good for clients and for practice and definitely good for those on a budget</li>
    <li> Love it  such a nice array of brushes for the price. Would buy them again only downside is the smell</li>
    <li> I needed a new brush set. I was happy with the quality of the product. I even brought one for my daughter and she loves it. I would recommend this set great buy!</li>
    <li> Brushes are very soft, great condition, and all pieces came together. I have not seen any shedding at all so far.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, awesome to contour with. I am in beauty school and while we were doing makeup and it made everything so much easier especially when you know what each brush is used for.</li>
    <li> The big brushes she&#x27;s a lot but the eye brushes work wonders</li>
