      <li>The colors were very light and didn&#x27;t take as well as the other brands that were later</li>
      <li>My husband is an amateur tattoo artist who has tried a few different kind of inks and found StarBrite ink to be top teir.  </li>
      <li>And as far as I can tell they are legit.</li>
      <li>im new to tattooing and have been practicing on practice skin for some time when I decided that I wanted to do actual work.</li>
      <li>That wasnt the only problem, the seal on the blue ink was damaged, I can get over the blue but the red was very dissapointing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about these sellers at all so cannot and won&#x27;t comment on shipping , leaking or any of that. I can tell you I have had my arms sleeved with StarBrite Ink for MANY years and it is still bright vibrant and has hardly faded at all. All I know is the sleeves I have had for years still have great color. If your tats fade with this ink you better find a new artist who knows how to get the ink in correctly.</li>
    <li> these inks are incredible. im new to tattooing and have been practicing on practice skin for some time when I decided that I wanted to do actual work. i read reviews on good inks and selected starbrite, the ink settles well and is amazingly vivid color.</li>
    <li> The ink works amazingly&lt;br /&gt;I love it! The only white ink that has ever stayed and shown uo on me&lt;br /&gt;Very very satisfied customer</li>
    <li> I gave this item to my daughter-in-law as a gift and I do not know if she has used it in her tattoo studio yet.  She requested this item on her Amazon wish list, so I assume this brand has a good reputation in the tattoo artist community.</li>
    <li> I tried lot ink this is best I done 4 large tattoos with it .Its thick mix well with other colors same brand Doesn&#x27;t fade heals quick an shipped fast</li>
    <li> They sent this to me the next day and was able to use right away. the ink is not knock off and is the real starbrite..</li>
    <li> All of these colors and good and super bright. I would get more from them...Best ink around any town baby!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Not really impressed with this particular color kit. The colors seem to fade down after the tattoo has healed.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and in good condition. My husband loves it and I love the bright colors.</li>
    <li> not real starbrite inks. they are watery and not worth the money. i hated it. the packageing sucked also. i would not recommend this product.-XOAuriBeauty&lt;br /&gt;XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Watered down. Total waste</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottles were going to be. Still a great price. Hadn&#x27;t been able to try because these are a bit pricey. But with this deal I can try a lot of the colors out at a fraction of the cost to see if I actually like them.&lt;br /&gt;Love that they are sterilized, so I know they are good to use. I love the richness of the colors and how bright they show up. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> great ink. This ink is great colors are all vibrant and with just this set right here, if you know how to mix you can mix it</li>
    <li> Great item and fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy this is some of the best ink out there. On the other hand I ordered seven primary colors and I did not receive the colors as advertised. They sent me two blacks in place of other colors. So I gave them only four stars because of this.</li>
    <li> I am a professional tattoo artist and have been for the past ten years. I have used most of the colors in the starbrite line and all are decent.  I do however highly recommend country but canary yellow, and bright white.  These are mandatory colors in your stable.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tattooist and I tried this ink on a client and 2weeks later the ink fell out n I was not happy so I got ink from intenze Wow better quality n brite</li>
    <li> I really like star bright inks, although some of their colors dont like to stick like the blue and pink..... but thats only on some people. Others it sticks like a dream. So maybe it&#x27;s the bases of peoples skin, but I still love the ink</li>
    <li> The ink stays in the skin well but after healing seems to fade pretty fast. Touch ups are a must</li>
    <li> Good product. Slow delivery</li>
    <li> great colors they stick well in the skin and heal up nice... i had a slight issue but i contacted the seller and they responded promptly and resolved the issue with no problems.  i will definitely be re-ordering starbrite pigments from this company again</li>
    <li> Great stuff always will be ordering real soon!</li>
    <li> Ive used alot of different brands of ink. But i am blown away by Starbrite! These inks fly into the skin super quick, packed with pigment and are really bright when healed. This is the way tattoo ink should be! I highly recommend this ink. U will be very impressed! Thanks. R. TAT</li>
    <li> All the colors are great.</li>
    <li> It came in quick and was exactly what was advertised</li>
    <li> Awesome inks, just perfect for really really colourfull tattoos, the item was well packaged, no inconvenients at all. I recomend this to begginers, interediates or professionals. Has all the necesary colours to start making all your tattoos right out of the box. Amazing.</li>
    <li> This ink shipped quickly.  I have used this brand before and I never had any problems or issues with it.  The package shipped quickly, I had no issues with the ink leaking in the box.  This are great to travel with, perfect size.</li>
    <li> My husband is an amateur tattoo artist who has tried a few different kind of inks and found StarBrite ink to be top teir.  Lays nice and stays nice.  Shipped as stated and we are very happy with this transaction.</li>
    <li> i finally got my starbrite ink in the mail, and tried it on myself and the ink is one of the best,i&#x27;ve been tattooing on and off for a right good while and tried alot of brands and the new and improved sterile ink is awesome i could not believe how good the lite blue went in and you know lite inks such as white yellow ect. is hard to put in and not bleed out,and the lite blue ink did not bleed at all .the iron buttery fly is made by starbrite,but it&#x27;s not quiet as good,for some reasom but do&#x27;nt get me wrong the iron butter fly is quality top grade ink,and a little cheaper.i&#x27;m buying me some more starbrite ink because i love the colors and it go&#x27;s in and packs the colors in the first time and its safe and you protect yourself and your customers because its sterilized and haves safe pigments. lol crazy rick I,M BACK WITH ANOTHER REVIEW ON STARBRITE, I&#x27;M ORDERING MORE BECAUSE IT ONE OF THE BEST TATTOO INK ON THE MARKET. I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR A WHILE NOW AND LOVE IT, IT MIXES GOOD AND SHADES AND BLENDS IN GOOD,AND HOLDS UP ,THE COLOR DON&#x27;NT FADE LIKE ALOT OF THEM OTHER BRANDS OUT THERE, BUT I&#x27;M TRING ALL THE TOP OF THE LINE BRANDS. THANKS LOL CRAZY RICK</li>
    <li> Very nice colors they run out really well</li>
    <li> Good pigments pack well and looks bright when healed.</li>
    <li> This truly is one of the best tattoo ink deals out there. So very glad I ordered this set. The yellow is so bright!</li>
    <li> Really disappointed that 3 of the inks were opened an had no seal, Pink leaked a little, white was all crusty an the green had a damn ink cap placed inside the bottle, maybe it was used already? Shipping took about 2 weeks witch was odd.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much! Very fast shipping! It came a day before the estimated delivery began. It came October 1 when the estimated delivery was October 2-7. Very pleased! A+++++</li>
    <li> Starbrite is a great ink. I&#x27;m a kuro sumi man myself but starbrite has some great colors. And as far as I can tell they are legit. Hold great</li>
    <li> 5 of the 6 bottles arrived in good shape. Pink had no seal and leaked everywhere.</li>
    <li> I checked the reviews, and was excited about trying the colors. To begin with my order wasn&#x27;t correct the first time. Luckly the sender did the right thing and made good on that. However, the product it self was disappointing. The colors were very light and didn&#x27;t take as well as the other brands that were later tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part,  I have had very pleasant experences ordering all kinds of items from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I have never written a bad review but I had to share this. The packaging was one of the worst I&#x27;ve seen and the red ink came in without a seal and was half way empty. Plus the ink was all crystalized. I was very very upset because that was the main ink I intended to use. That wasnt the only problem, the seal on the blue ink was damaged, I can get over the blue but the red was very dissapointing.</li>
    <li> This ink is decent, pretty good consistency, the colors are bright, they all go in pretty easy besides blue. They don&#x27;t look the same in the skin as it does in the bottle. The shipping was very fast arrived on time, bottles did not leak and they all had a good seal. For the price you get some good ink but I&#x27;d personally buy a more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> BEST INK MONEY CAN BUY BAR-NONE. THATS ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID BUT IT WONT LET ME SUBMIT IT</li>
    <li> Color that is vibrant and sticks!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with starbrite been using this ink for 11 years now.</li>
    <li> Tommy supply has done a wonderful job at developing an amazing ink</li>
    <li> Okay I am a tattoo artist I have a lessens to tattoo but I work from my home can&#x27;t take shop BS ........ I&#x27;m doing this for so called &amp;#34;Scratchers&amp;#34; so u dont get ripped off and most of all so u don&#x27;t hurt anyone unintentionally this ink is good so far it dose look like real Starbright ink I will edit this review after I use the ink  thanks for reading  Doc</li>
    <li> Do not buy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ink is water down , they are fake inks ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the inks was open (Scarlet Red)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were dirty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didnt come on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An they seem smaller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> i was very pleased with the shipping it was really fast!&lt;br /&gt;when i opened my package the pink one seem to have leaked a tiny bit but i know the inks are sterilized so i don&#x27;t think it should be a big problem.. and its not like all of them leaked and mixed together so over all it is great.</li>
