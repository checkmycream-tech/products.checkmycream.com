      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry, and smells great!  </li>
      <li>Plus you don&#x27;t need to use a large amount to get good results.    </li>
      <li>Leaves hair light and healthy, Girlfriend likes the smell too.</li>
      <li>Its not as moisturizing as the clear moisture, no surprise, but does a great job.</li>
      <li>This was a reorder for us, but it&#x27;s nice to order it in volume and at a more reasonable price.</li>
      <li>No conditioning properties so rinses easily.</li>
      <li>The proteins and glycerin which are part of its main ingredients are supposed to be good for the hair.</li>

      <li>I was really happy when Redken came out with specific products geared toward men.</li>

      <li>It leaves my hair clean and free of residue.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to try this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>One of the qualities I like in Redken is their dedication to consistently producing  top quality products.  </li>

      <li>Prompt shipping and a good price for a good product that seems to be hard to find in the stores these days.</li>
      <li>It does not leave a squeaky clean feeling, even after washing 3x my hair feels oily and unclean.  </li>
      <li>Does what is supposed to do, leave you with clean hair.  </li>
      <li>My stylist told me that I had wax build up and suggested the Redken Go Clean product.  </li>
      <li>Good Product, Using it for several years.</li>
      <li>I asked some female customers at the shop that sells this to rate the smell, and they all loved it.</li>
      <li>Clean fresh smell</li>
      <li>You may want to consider sturdier packaging and more than just a tiny strip of tape over the top.</li>
      <li>It builds a nice lather, has a fantastic neutral smell, and it seemed to make my hair thicker overall.</li>
      <li>Maybe after reading all those 5 star reviews I was expecting something truly extraordinary and it didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
      <li>Great product, fast shipping, everything as expected.</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner work very well together, and I feel post-shower that my hair is clean and not greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>This product really does make my hair feel clean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, everything as expected. You may want to consider sturdier packaging and more than just a tiny strip of tape over the top.</li>
    <li> My barber had recommended this shampoo for me, since I have thinning hair. The proteins and glycerin which are part of its main ingredients are supposed to be good for the hair. I love the smell of this shampoo and it lathers just perfectly. It makes me look forward to jumping in the shower each day. Even though its a bit more expensive than what I normally pay, this shampoo is definitely worth it.  You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and the price was very competitive. I have a hard time finding the large size of Redkin&#x27;s Go Clean Shampoo for men so I&#x27;m very pleased to have an on-line store that carries it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time.  Amazon found this at a price about 1/2 of what I paid at Wal Mart.</li>
    <li> Asked for a pump and they sent 2, arrived super fast. Great simple daily shampoo, cleans great.</li>
    <li> I was really happy when Redken came out with specific products geared toward men. The shampoo and conditioner work very well together, and I feel post-shower that my hair is clean and not greasy feeling. Some shampoos feel so heavy and then leave your hair feeling weighted down - this one doesn&#x27;t do that. Plus you don&#x27;t need to use a large amount to get good results.    I recommend buying this product online since many salons charge exorbitant amounts for high-end brands like Redken.</li>
    <li> Had issues with an itchy scalp until I tried this.  Love it.  Will definitely become my go to shampoo for daily use.</li>
    <li> Husband really likes this stuff.  Pleasant smell, not girly at all.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this shampoo.  Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping and a good price for a good product that seems to be hard to find in the stores these days. I have used this shampoo for years and swear it is the same thing (different packaging) that I used from them back in the early 1980s.</li>
    <li> Not a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; shampoo, but good if you&#x27;re washing your hair more than it likes, i.e. multiple times a day. Along with dirt, shampooing removes most of the good oils from your hair. This product is milder on the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking like straw. I use this for routine shampoos and another stronger shampoo for when I skip days. Nice smell if you like old men&#x27;s cologne. Citrusy.</li>
    <li> Somewhat disappointed. Maybe after reading all those 5 star reviews I was expecting something truly extraordinary and it didn&#x27;t happen. Shampoo is good, but nothing \\&quot;out of this world\\&quot;. Frankly, I&#x27;m  not sure I will order it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has suddenly gotten to be too expensive.  It&#x27;s gone up about $10 a bottle since I last bought it last September.  I&#x27;m going back to American Crew.  Same results, lower price.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair light and healthy, Girlfriend likes the smell too. I keep one of the smaller bottles of Go clean around and use this size to refill it.</li>
    <li> Great for men&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I changed from Head and Shoulders.... Should have done this a LONG time ago!!! It feels great afterwords, and I never get tired of the scent! It wakes me up every day!!!! This is a must have shampoo and I will never use another kind!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, received as promised, would definitely order from this Seller again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo caused my son to break out in hives from his head to his toes for 3 days.  He was miserable and needed steroids to get rid of the hives.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good buy for more of a bulk size.  I still just refill my smaller bottle.</li>
    <li> I came from using Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea tree shampoo, thought I&#x27;d try Redken since it seems to have a good reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without looking at ingredients (who has time for that?) this shampoo is OKAY at best for my preferences.  It does not leave a squeaky clean feeling, even after washing 3x my hair feels oily and unclean.  It smells good... I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re buying this particular brand in the smaller bottle at a salon then you are paying way too much. This bottle can last me anywhere from 6 to 9 months. All you need is a little and it goes a long ways and I shower morning and evening.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the only one the men in my family will use. It smells great and masculine, while cleaning dirty, oily hair very well. Sometimes it is hard to find, but worth looking for. I hope they will continue to make this great shampoo. We buy the big bottle so we don&#x27;t run out. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for some years now. It&#x27;s great, perfect for me. Now it comes in this larger container... even better... savings.</li>
    <li> Can not judge bottle came with hole in the bottom and shampoo leaked out</li>
    <li> Perfectly for everyday use. Feel refresh after use.</li>
    <li> This was a reorder for us, but it&#x27;s nice to order it in volume and at a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo for my husband and he loves it!</li>
    <li> What can you say? It is shampoo. No conditioning properties so rinses easily. I asked some female customers at the shop that sells this to rate the smell, and they all loved it. Nuff said? :-)</li>
    <li> Simply put, I was 100% satisfied with the shipping and condition of the item I purchased.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Company delivered product as promised.  Had an issue initially, but company very responsive to customer satisfaction.  Recommend</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Love the smell, clean and refreshing -- but for the love of all that is holy, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to cut through the oil in my hair and I keep it extremely short (military).</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Love the smell. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years. I buy small bottles at first and then buy a big bottle to refill the small one with. That way my shower isn&#x27;t dominated by the 33oz version.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great results. My favorite shampoo. And a great price in the large economy size.</li>
    <li> Great seller! Great shampoo! The only shampoo   that my husband likes after 4 years of trying  different shampoos.</li>
    <li> I reviewed the Redken Clear Moisture, which was my go to shampoo for a few years. After moving to a place which uses well water i began noticing that my hair never felt clean for long. I decided to give this shampoo a try. Its been great at removing some of the build up without stripping my hair. Its not as moisturizing as the clear moisture, no surprise, but does a great job. I plan to rotate the two for now on.</li>
    <li> I complained to my barber about poofy damaged hair, and he sold me an 11oz bottle i believe it was of this same exact shampoo, i loved it. many people actually wondered if had cut my hair differently after i started using this shampoo. But the problem was the 11oz bottle was about $12... and that&#x27;s a bit steep for me, so here i am on amazon purchasing this for the 2nd time. The last bottle lasted for a few months (I have short hair).</li>
    <li> use every day.  easy on fine hair</li>
    <li> My favorite daily use shampoo.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry, and smells great!  Awesome price too, my hair stylist sells the tiny bottle at the same price.</li>
    <li> Again, Redkin products for men work great for me.  Not bald on this 66 y.o. head. :)</li>
    <li> So nice and clean, gets all of the product out of my hair</li>
    <li> After years and years of using my favorite shampoo, they discontinued making it, so now I was faced with shampoo soul searching.  Men can relate to how disheartened I felt, when my loyalty was betrayed.  Rightly so, I had been using another brand when I realized that my hair just didn&#x27;t feel right, it didn&#x27;t feel alive or jubilant.  It was as if my hair was going through the every day motions along with the rest of me.  My stylist told me that I had wax build up and suggested the Redken Go Clean product.  At first I was reluctant to try it because I was going through shampoo withdrawal but my trust in my stylist and my disfranchised hair persuaded me otherwise.  That evening, I put a little dab close to my nose and the aroma was pleasantly handsome, not strong but not faint either.  Exact words cannot describe the smell I experience except to say that it made me think of sitting in a new car or taking out laundry fresh from the dryer on a cold wintry day.  I realize that I was in for the most uplifting experience of my life.  Once I put the dab on my hair, it was like quenching a dried neglected plant that was clinging on to dear life.  My hair became consumed with the proteins and glycerin to give it a natural bounce and shine as if to say thank you.  Now I know the reason they call this a daily product, it is because my hair longs for it.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo I use!</li>
    <li> Awesome mens hair product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It makes my hair feel really soft and has a fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Great product for thin hair</li>
    <li> Great product for shampooing daily.  No need to luck further.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is great.  when I ran out of my first retail bottle and came here to buy another, i saw this massive sized one and used it to refill my original bottle that I keep in the shower.  great deal, great product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this shampoo that great at all. Yea, it cleans my hair. But the cap on the bottle is so difficult to open it actually hurts my fingers. It doesn&#x27;t lather very well and leaves my hair feeling pretty dry. I will probably next move on to the next &#x27;for men&#x27; shampoo product that I haven&#x27;t tried yet...</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo.  I do not like the top that they use with this product.  It is a flip open top that can accidentally open and allow the contents to spill out.  I prefer the rocking type opening that some other brands use.  Also with this top it&#x27;s harder to control the amount of shampoo dispensed.</li>
    <li> Since I tried this for the first time last year, this is the only shampoo I get for my husband. It smells so good, his hair gets soft, really good!</li>
    <li> This product met all my expectations.  It cleans great, good suds action, smells great.  It leaves my hair clean and free of residue.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Clean fresh smell and it doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oil out of your hair like the supermarket stuff.  Really hard to find (beauty supply stores only) and I&#x27;ve never seen it in this size.</li>
    <li> It may seem to be a little expensive, but its the best shampoo I have ever used. Use the conditioner products too.</li>
    <li> This product really does make my hair feel clean. I have used All-Soft shampoo for several years, but my hair felt oily. I liked the smell of the All-Soft, but this Go Clean product is nice to, not too perfumy and not medicinal. Good clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Most shampoos dry my hair out and make my hair feel rough and brittle. Within a week of using RedKen shampoo, my hair feels softer and more moisturized. I&#x27;m so impressed with the results, I ordered RedKen conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for several years.  It has a fresh, clean, manly scent and his hair looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  I have a very thin strand of hair and this product, with just a small amount, not only cleans my hair, but keeps it in good shape until the next day&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it is as advertised.  I highly recommend it to men who may be looking for a new, better shampoo.  Very good product!!  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> but the price it&#x27;s quite high.</li>
    <li> good value, priced about the same as a 16 oz bottle on other sites</li>
    <li> Redken Go Clean works fine as a daily shampoo, but only if you don&#x27;t have a dandruff-prone scalp. It builds a nice lather, has a fantastic neutral smell, and it seemed to make my hair thicker overall. However I&#x27;m knocking it two stars for two reasons. First, it has salicylic acid in it, the same stuff that&#x27;s in your pimple cream and works as a drying agent. If you deal with flakes at all this shampoo could exacerbate the problem (it did for me). Second, it&#x27;s simply overpriced. I understand the idea that \\&quot;a little goes a long way\\&quot; but the same can be said of other products on the shelf that don&#x27;t have a price tag this high; specifically, I&#x27;m referring to shampoos that don&#x27;t use sodium lauryl sulfate such as those in the Clear Men Scalp Therapy line.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Does a great job of cleaning my hear and it smells great as well, highly recommend.</li>

    <li> The absolute best smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever seen or used. It has a very masculine and almost cologne smell that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by several people.  I was excited to try this shampoo.  This product has no lather and it totally dried my hair out (even with conditioner).  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Been using various Redken products over the years, and this matches up the the quality I expect. A good shampoo.</li>
    <li> A great shampoo for men.  Period.</li>
    <li> I have used Redken products for many years.  This was my first experience with this particular shampoo and I was not disappointed. One of the qualities I like in Redken is their dedication to consistently producing  top quality products.  I will continue to know that whatever product I use will be just what I needed.</li>
