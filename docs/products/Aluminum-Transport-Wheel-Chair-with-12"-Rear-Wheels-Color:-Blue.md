      <li>This way my partner and I don&#x27;t have to sacrifice our walking explorations and my mom is in in all the fun.</li>

      <li>This was perfect for transporting small adult to the bathroom or the kitchen.</li>

      <li>so I called the company and found out I was supposed to call the seller first.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what we were looking for.</li>

      <li>The bigger wheels make it easy to push around.</li>

      <li>The wonderful thing about it is that I can actually stand it behind my seat in my Honda Civic four door sedan.  </li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because the seat is quite low and the armrests are a bit high to get in and out of easily.  </li>
      <li>The chair is great; back 12\\&quot; wheels are definitely a help over rougher terrain and the brakes are really handy when going down a slight incline.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it to others needing a transport chair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this chair.  </li>
      <li>Made it easy to transfer to other areas.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve already been to the county fair, a parade in downtown and to our local mall.  </li>
      <li>We originally had a chair which had a  19 inch wide seat,  and the one they sent  was narrower.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Having this chair for my Mom has been a blessing. It is lighter than a wheelchair and easier for me to get in and out of our vehicle. Having the breaks on the handles is wonderful as I&#x27;m not always leaning over her to lock the wheels. She finds it more comforable because the back is higher too!! I&#x27;m very happy with my choice to get this chair and it got here quickly too! I&#x27;d highly recommend it to others needing a transport chair.</li>
    <li> Good construction, but the front wheels stink.  It&#x27;s been 3 months and my wife&#x27;s car still has to be aired out when we get in.  We had this with a pull cart we bought from the container store too...it seems that rubber is being replaced by some other material when manufactured in China and it stinks...not much we can do about it.  Other than that, it&#x27;s an excellent transport chair and our second one of this type.  BTW...taking off the wheels and soaking them in vinegar does not remove the smell.</li>
    <li> Light and easy to get in and out of vehicle to use.  Has an easy fluid movement - easy to push around with a person in it.  Very well made and does not seem to be flin\msy at all.  The bigger wheels make it easy to push around.</li>
    <li> Well built and shipped assembled, the Invacare Transport Chair suited our purposes perfectly because of the following:  It is light weight but sturdy.  It can be folded to transport in a trunk of a car.  The footrests are easily detachable.</li>
    <li> It is so smooth, sturdy, and lightweight.  If it stands the test of time, it will prove to be the best.  So far we are extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> My father already has an Invacare rollator walker &amp; I liked its sturdy quality. I read reviews/comparisons on this transport chair &amp; was convinced would be best choice. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed; it&#x27;s sturdy yet lightweight (19.5 lbs). I have back problems but this chair is light enough for me to pick up &amp; store either in the back seat or trunk of my Toyota Corolla. The 12\\&quot; rear wheels does make it easier to maneuver. As for the issue with the foot rests swaying about once the chair is closed/folded, I used a short bungi cord thru the chair to hold them in place &amp; that solved the problem. It was a great investment for the money &amp; CSN Stores provided the best price. What I like about them, is they under promise &amp; over deliver. Ordered the chair on a Sunday &amp; received it (in great shape) by Wednesday; I didn&#x27;t expect delivery for a week. I highly recommend both the chair &amp; the vendor!</li>
    <li> The chair is nice.  It is light for my husband to get in and out of the car.  It pushes fairly easily on rough surfaces such as stone paving.  I gave it 4 stars because the seat is quite low and the armrests are a bit high to get in and out of easily.  I got a thick cushion to put in the seat and that helps.  The cushion also helps with the short foot rests. A regular wheel chair might be easier to push but would also be heavier to get in and out of a car.  Over all, I&#x27;m pleased with this chair.</li>
    <li> This is our second chair, it has been the best thing , it holds up well got so much use that we thought it was time for a new one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife who had arthriris and fibromyalgia. It was a hugh help to both of us. It was easy to fold and fit into the trunk of our Impala along with our luggage for medical appointments and shopping. Because of this chair, she was able to enjoy shopping again. It was quick to set up and easily pushed in parking lots, sidewalks and buildings. I particularly enjoyed having the brakes on the push handles plus I did not have to find and fetch a chair at every location. For people in the same or similar situation, I can&#x27;t recommend this chair enough.</li>
    <li> This transport chair has given my mother the freedom to accompany me and my husband everywhere!  We&#x27;ve already been to the county fair, a parade in downtown and to our local mall.  This chair has kept my mother from being house bound! It&#x27;s exactly what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a strong and lightweight means to transport an elderly person.  I have pushed it up small hills at the beach and have used it off pavement in the National Parks so it seems rugged for more than a trip to the shopping center.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to take my mom on trips to local amusement park to see the shows.  It is light weight, very easy to handle and maneuver and we are quite happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews and am glad that we chose the one with the 12&amp;#34; inch rear wheels.  She does not have the arm strength to self propel so this was perfect for us.  If she wants to get out and walk and push the car, it is fine for that as well.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for transporting small adult to the bathroom or the kitchen. Fits through our doors.  Made it easy to transfer to other areas.</li>
    <li> My mom can walk, but only for short distances. Having is chair makes it possible to take her along on vacation and still walk everywhere. This way my partner and I don&#x27;t have to sacrifice our walking explorations and my mom is in in all the fun. Folds nicely into the back of the car and rolls smoothly.</li>
    <li> I pick my Mom up to take drives and sometimes go to the park.  Using this wheel chair has saved my back from lifting her big wheel chair in and out of the car.</li>
    <li> Great transport chair...lightweight and easy to stash in trunk of car.  Bought one for both my Mom and Mother in law.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and easy for me to lift.  Big wheels in the rear make transporting my husband easier then dealing with big wheels on other chairs.  Only problem is you must be careful when loading a patient into the chair as it will tip backwards if you are not holding onto the back of the chair.  Otherwise we like it very much.  The arms could be padded a little better too, but they work ok.  Would highly recommend this chair as long as caution when seating someone is taken.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> We purchased this wheelchair for my father who is 85 and has trouble getting around. He is mobile but moves very slowly. This chair is light enough for my mother to get in and out of the trunk and for her to push. My father is about 5&#x27; 3&amp;#34; and weighs about 125 lbs. This chair fits him well and he says it is very comfortable. The only negative comment I have is regarding the brakes. The brakes do not work all that well, but are good enough to slow down the chair on wheelchair ramps. For a heavier passenger, I think it may be a problem. Also, as has been noted by other reviewers, there is no locking brake mechanism. My father is mobile enough to get into the chair by himself, so I can hold the chair and squeeze the hand brake while he sits down. If help is needed to seat the passenger, then I think it may be difficult - especially if the ground isn&#x27;t perfectly flat.</li>
    <li> The chair seems pretty sturdy and rather easy to push, however, I can&#x27;t seems to position the foot rests without them blocking and locking the front wheels.</li>
    <li> The chair is great; back 12\\&quot; wheels are definitely a help over rougher terrain and the brakes are really handy when going down a slight incline.  Folds up well and is light to handle.  Used for a local walkabout in a nearby town and because of the size and agility of the chair we were able to get into almost all the artist studios and stores (only those with steps were off limits.  Went over the grass and quite a few bumpy spots but chair handled well and my mother (87) felt safe and comfortable in it.</li>
    <li> We just unpacked our wheelchair.  It was easy to prepare for use. The quality is excellent .  We purchased this model because it has larger wheels to go through our thick St. Augustine grass.  The cloth grab handles  on the seat make it easy to fold and carry.  The fold down push-handles make storage a snap</li>
    <li> Light (about 19-20 lbs.) and much easier to handle than a wheel chair (35-40 lbs.).  Great to take my Mother to out of facility events like Walmart, Mall, Parks etc.  Easy to manuever.  Good value.  Well constructed and roomy.</li>
    <li> This chair is perfect!!!  I bought this chair on the advice of some therapists and am so glad they suggested it.  When it first arrived one of the foot rests would not tighten up so I called the company and found out I was supposed to call the seller first.  The company gave me a complaint number to give to the seller so that they would have the information they needed when the seller contacted them.  When I called the seller they were nice and said they would take care of it and the part would be on it&#x27;s way as soon as possible.  I did not hear anything for a week so I called the seller again and they called the company and found out that the part should be here in the next day or two.  It was here the next morning!  I have used this chair for a few months now and it is wonderful.  My husband is comfortable and we go all over with this chair.  It is very light and durable.  We took it on vacation with us and it could go pretty much anywhere.  Every so often I tighten up everything on it but that is going to happen no matter what chair you buy.  If you need a lightweight chair that is comfortable for the person and easy for you to push around this is it.</li>
    <li> good poduct for the money,very good for moving around town and doctors office.foot rests could be of better fit,hard tokeek ajusted</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this chair. Bought it for my 91 yr old Father to.transport him to Doctor appointments and other outings. Easy to move and fold. Fits in trunk well. Met our expectations.</li>
    <li> If you decide to purchase this chair be aware that Invacare&#x27;s service policies are absurd. Following about three months of mostly indoor use, one of the plastic rear wheel hub caps broke and went missing. Upon contacting Invacare through their authorized dealer I learned that the low-cost cap is not available separately and the entire wheel assembly would have to be purchased at the ridiculous price of almost half the cost of the entire new chair. When I contacted Invacare&#x27;s customer support, I was told they were unable to replace the part. So, based on my experience, I would warn others to stay clear of this product and others from this manufacturer because of Invacare&#x27;s total lack of integrity with regard to backing their products.</li>
    <li> My object in purchasing this chair was that I needed a wheelchair that would be easier for people with less strength to pick up and put the chair into a car.  Whereas the 50 lb. wheelchair was a little much for them to lift. This chair accomplishes that task as it is only 20 lbs.  The disadvantage is for the person sitting in the wheelchair in that she has not control to move it or put on the brakes.  Being a control freak and the person sitting in the chair, I find that difficult.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these for my father. He&#x27;s about 150 pounds. I do note others complaining that this unit doesn&#x27;t work well with 250-350 pound patients. I&#x27;m not surprised. This is a portable unit designed to fold down so it fits in the trunk of a car. We&#x27;ve had this unit over a year and it still looks and works like new. Over sidewalks and streets, the large wheels make transport of the patient convenient and comfortable; the wheels are large enough so they don&#x27;t get stuck. Bottom line: Good purchase and good value for the $$.</li>
    <li> We needed a lightweight mode of transportation for my Mom when she wouldn&#x27;t be using her walker. This has worked out great. It&#x27;s easy for me to get out of the car and rolls easily. Mother only weighs 70 lbs and is very small and it fits her perfectly. It arrived before the estimated arrival date.</li>
    <li> It is lightweight, folds easily and is easily maneuverable.  The handbrakes allow it to also be used as a walker.  Most advertised rolling walkers with seats do not have the armrests that are important for standing up.  This is an excellent substitute.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. Well made, sturdy construction, yet light weight.  Easily folds to fit in the car trunk..</li>
    <li> Received the chair quickly. Easy to set up. Lightweight and easy to fold up and put in the car. Very useful transporting husband to appointments when he is not up to walking all the way. Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Mom can get around with a walker, but she tires quickly if we are out for any length of time.  We purchased this chair after reading the reviews and checking the specs against some of the other chairs.  The wonderful thing about it is that I can actually stand it behind my seat in my Honda Civic four door sedan.  It is easy to maneuver in and out of the car, and the ride is excellent.  Mom finds it comfortable and it has made us able to go out almost anywhere we wish.  I highly recommend this chair.  It arrived all put together except for the footrests.</li>
    <li> The chair was too narrow and my husband could not fit his hips into it.  Sending it back would cost a lot of money.,  We originally had a chair which had a  19 inch wide seat,  and the one they sent  was narrower.  I am hoping to get a 19 inch seat chair from another company. So we are  stuck with this useless wheelchair.</li>
    <li> Went to grandsons&#x27; graduation very uncomfortable.  Sits too low.  Not for sitting, only getting in and out. Had trouble with foot rest.</li>
