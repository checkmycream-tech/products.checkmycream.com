<li> last a long time</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t last long when you spray it on for a day recommended cologne.</li>
<li> /&gt;Scent: The sour note from the original Issey is missing, and i find it a little sweeter over the 2013 edition.</li>
<li> , I don&#x27;t  appreciate the smell on my husband&#x27;s for that long, it actually disappear that quick considering the expensive price.</li>
<li> On my dry skin lasts for about 6-8 hours.</li>
<li> double the volume for half the price.</li>
<li> Totally as expected.</li>
<li> (but i would-not call it a &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; because it serves it purpose): the cap is really tight, so opening and closing the cap takes work...but a tight cap does mean that there is seal, so no juice evaporates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I actually purchased the wrong scent.</li>
<li> Am trying to find out the authenticity of this cologne if its real or fake.</li>

    <li> I purchased this item on a guess because my husband loves Issey Miyake cologne. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it smelled. My husband loves it and I do too.

(this is just my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;Bottle: Love the bottle! The color of the cap is especially eye capturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con (but i would-not call it a &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; because it serves it purpose): the cap is really tight, so opening and closing the cap takes work...but a tight cap does mean that there is seal, so no juice evaporates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason i bought it: needed a new summer smell, and cheapest (price wise) out of all the Issey summer line-up.</li>
