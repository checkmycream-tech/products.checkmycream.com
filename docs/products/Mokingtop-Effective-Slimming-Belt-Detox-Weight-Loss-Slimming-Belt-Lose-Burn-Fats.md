    <li> Nope, nope and nope. Good for tightening up for a party but that&#x27;s about it</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit anyone who&#x27;s trying to lose weight</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s meant to be worn by someone that&#x27;s a size 2 or smaller</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Paper wrap will do better...</li>
    <li> just a waste of my money even thought they were cheaper 😠😬</li>
    <li> Waste of money. You are better off using your seran wrap or your grocery bags.</li>
    <li> works great!  put it on for the walk home from work&lt;br /&gt;and when i took it off&lt;br /&gt;there was like at least a half cup of sweat!  Holy Moly!&lt;br /&gt;but its probaly all just water weight- so i dont use it that often-&lt;br /&gt;you kinda need water</li>
    <li> Did not like it it didn&#x27;t work for me it didn&#x27;t stay on it keep coming off so don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> cheap plastic is what I seen when I opened this product, I hated it and I will never order this again.</li>
    <li> Just a piece of plastic, serves no purpose.  Not sure what anyone could think that this is supposed to do</li>
    <li> I should have thoroughly checked over this thing. It&#x27;s better to put a Saran Wrap over your tummy than buy this in all honesty!!! Used it while working out today and once I took it off, the pink wrap was leaking with sweat and my mid section was drenched as well!! I didn&#x27;t see any improvement other than maybe losing water weight ? Should have reconsidered :(</li>
    <li> Just a piece of plastic, should have purchase Saran Wrap from the supermarket instead. This product didn&#x27;t do me any justice.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly with my nightly body wraps! I use them every night and I could see the results each morning.</li>
    <li> If your maybe a size 4 or 5 this will wrap around you. If your a size 7 don&#x27;t bother buying this it will not fit.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother, not worth it. If you can even get it around you who would want to, it smells, it&#x27;s sticky, uncomfortable, does not breathe, pure plastic junk.</li>
    <li> Just a piece of plastic, dont waist your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought because I wanted to lose some inches, didnt work at all</li>
    <li> Bull s*** no ideal how it works, please don&#x27;t sell to nobody else</li>
    <li> it wont wrap around waist unless you are already skinny.</li>
    <li> The worst item I have ever purchased from Amazon</li>
    <li> Worthless even at this price.</li>
    <li> It was plastic. I thought it was a belt.</li>

    <li> I didnt use yet, but I am not sure how to use it, if you guys can explain me how , will be awesome, thanks :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell. Instructions written in Chinese and I cannot understand&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;This is from my daughter&#x27;s perspective of whom I purchased it for.  Sh&lt;br /&gt;asked me.  So I can&#x27;t really say, since I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> It broke my skin out with a rash and welts</li>
    <li> docent even stick to your stomach</li>
    <li> It does make you sweat by I have to secure it with a zipped body slimming belt.  But for the price it does make you sweat especially while you exercise.  Need to buy bigger because it comes a tad small and does not go all the way around.</li>
    <li> No good ya just be taking people money</li>
    <li> Didnt even fit around me I had to give it away</li>
