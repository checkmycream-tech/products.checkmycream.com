      <li>They loved the smell.</li>

      <li>Love B &amp; B!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>But, oh, the lovely non-greasy moisture!  </li>
      <li>It just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything spectacular to my hair to justify the price.</li>

      <li>Smells great, and worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Aside from leaving your hair smelling absolutely fantastic, it does a great job at keeping hair healthy.</li>
      <li>Basically most bumble &amp; bumble products are all amazing</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and makes hair shiny and more manageable .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a heavier shampoo/conditioner and great for making curls and waves lay the right way.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using Pureology now, much better.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair has nice body, it&#x27;s silky smooth, no noticeable scent</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I get LOTS more compliments on my hair since I started using it.</li>
      <li>It smells ok.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, love the feel of this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is ok, .</li>
      <li>I love it and continue to buy it. : )</li>
      <li>but I absolutely LOVE the smell of the creme de coco &amp;</li>
      <li>As with the shampoo, I have bleached platinum hair and this line smells great and keeps my hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
      <li>(it was more like the effect of using a cheap hotel hair product).  </li>
      <li>It is great, detangles and leaves hair soft.</li>
      <li>The delivery was fast and the price was good.</li>
      <li>I thought that it would make my hair smooth and give it more shine, but my hair feels like I am using a cheap supermarket brand shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have nice healthy hair.</li>
      <li>And it was mailed very quickly.</li>
      <li>It has worked well for me when I had shoulder-lenghth hair, and it works great with my currently short cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There was nothing fantastic about it, expect for the smell.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;ve been consistently using the Coco conditioner, my stylist always comments how healthy my hair is.  </li>
      <li>I believe this is what led me to thinking it was super fabulous</li>
      <li>This conditioner is great for dry, damaged hair.</li>
      <li>so I use it sparingly for special occasions</li>
      <li>I only deducted a star because I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but until I find something this good</li>
      <li>a conditioner should - it adds moisture, makes it easier to comb through my curls when they are wet, and it smells AMAZING :)</li>
      <li>it leaves my hair soft &amp; shiny :)  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft and smooth, helps with frizzes and the smell is fabulous but doesn&#x27;t overpower</li>
      <li>Often times i just use Pantene curly hair shampoo/conditioner, but Bumble and Bumble Creme de Coco is my favorite by far when i can afford it.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft, healthy and delicious-smelling.</li>
      <li>--- I have thin, fine hair for those looking for a good conditioner I def recommend!</li>
      <li>alternate this conditioner with other brands to mix things up, and this product is always the best.</li>
      <li>Considering how often I use this product, I noticed right away that the color was off.</li>
      <li>Sure, this stuff costs $$$, but I just went through my cupboard (shameful product graveyard!) and contributed twice this much to the local shelter.</li>
      <li>I have been using this conditioner for almost 10 years and like it very much.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have to use much because it&#x27;s so think; one bottle lasts me about a year!</li>
      <li>You only need an amount in the size of a dime, or more if you have longer hair.</li>
      <li>What a waste ( for me) of an insanely good scent.</li>
      <li>conditioner does a great job of absorbing into the hair follicle making it really soft, yet it never makes my hair feel or look weighed down.</li>
      <li>I have thick, medium to coarse brown hair and this conditioner is perfect for that type of texture.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, bouncy, and full of body.     </li>
      <li>I have been using the Bumble and Bumble shampoo and conditioner for over a year now, and my hair is alway super soft.  </li>
      <li>I was smart ( ???</li>
      <li>Buy moisture maniac if you really want to see result and its  aquarter of the price.</li>
      <li>The vanilla scent is very fragrant without being overpowering.  </li>
      <li>and then the Gentle Shampoo, (which I like quite a bit)   </li>
      <li>and I love the coconut oil/scent getting harder to find</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to have my healthy, shiny, soft hair back!</li>
      <li>On work days, I add [[ASIN:B000BIUGRI Bumble and Bumble Prep (8 Ounces)]] and then a small dollop of [[ASIN:B000BIXP4O Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme, 8-Ounce Bottle]] and blow out for a look that is still natural, but stays in place and looks good all day.  </li>
      <li>If you find the price to be a bit much for the combination, I highly recommend buying just the conditioner and using your choice of shampoo.  </li>
      <li>with winter &amp; heated dry air, upon us  I expect they will enjoy this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Only conditioner that makes my hair smooth and young.</li>
      <li>When you use a shampoo that really dries out your hair, this conditioner puts moisture right back in.</li>
      <li>It seemed just like a normal conditioner</li>
      <li>I had taken a long break from this conditioner, and just came back to it after considering getting keratin treatment for my fine frizzy wavy hair (but being reluctant to put chemicals in my hair).  </li>
      <li>I love all B&amp;B products and this conditioner keeps my hair healthy and prevents my extremely long and thick wavy hair from getting too dry.</li>
      <li>how smart is 8 bucks for a mini bottle of conditioner, I am so warped) and only purchased a mini of this</li>
      <li>For several days after using the conditioner, my hair has been left very tangled and frizzy so much so that my hair breaks when I comb it.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really sensitive to over-scented products (I&#x27;m the one in the shampoo aisle taking the caps off every bottle).  </li>
      <li>The Bumble and Bumble products keep my hair feeling soft and keep it in place.      </li>
      <li>I have a LOT of thick semi-curly/wavy brown hair that i like to wear curly and straighten on the ends to make it lay a bit better.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not that special, my hair is harder to detangle,the ends are really dry, and it isn&#x27;t really that soft like say after Pureology.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The Creme de Coco conditioner is horrible. (I always buy from a salon mind you) It leaves your hair feeling waxy and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t absorb into the hair follicle. It smells ok. I&#x27;m not a fan. I have medium texture and long hair with highlights. I&#x27;m using Pureology now, much better. I must say though that the Creme de Coco Shampoo is awesome, but the conditioner-not so much!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0016855UK Bumble and Bumble Creme de Coco Conditioner]]    I have been using this since recommended by a beautician for my 4 ft long hair 5 years ago.  It is great, detangles and leaves hair soft. I get LOTS more compliments on my hair since I started using it.</li>
    <li> My sister has been using the Bumble and Bumble shampoos for years (Seaweed), and I&#x27;d tried them at her house, but never seen the attraction (her hair is gorgeous, though.  on the recommendation of my hair dresser, I tried the Creme de Coco line, and I am hooked!    The conditioner has a slight coconut smell - very slight.  I&#x27;m really sensitive to over-scented products (I&#x27;m the one in the shampoo aisle taking the caps off every bottle).  The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger in my hair either.  But, oh, the lovely non-greasy moisture!  My hair is soft, bouncy, and full of body.     I&#x27;ve been using the Coco shampoo and conditioner alone on my days off with great results.  My hair has nice body, it&#x27;s silky smooth, no noticeable scent (this is a plus for me).  On work days, I add [[ASIN:B000BIUGRI Bumble and Bumble Prep (8 Ounces)]] and then a small dollop of [[ASIN:B000BIXP4O Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme, 8-Ounce Bottle]] and blow out for a look that is still natural, but stays in place and looks good all day.  Sure, this stuff costs $$$, but I just went through my cupboard (shameful product graveyard!) and contributed twice this much to the local shelter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t trust that I received Bumble and Bumble product. I have used this conditioner before and loved it. This time around it is drying my hair out and making it feel straw-like. Bummer.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really help dry hair and only has a faint smell of coconut. Not worth the money. Do yourself a favour and save money, get the Suave professional conditioner which works as well if not better for a tenth of the price.</li>
    <li> My hair just isn&#x27;t the same without this conditioner.  I use the Creme de Coco shampoo as well, but the conditioner is what makes all the difference.  If you find the price to be a bit much for the combination, I highly recommend buying just the conditioner and using your choice of shampoo.  No other conditioner moisturizes my hair and keeps it silky &amp; tangle-free like this conditioner -- and I have tried several other similarly priced brands.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair and this works very well.  It smells great also.  I love it and continue to buy it. : )</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, healthy and delicious-smelling. Don&#x27;t have to use much because it&#x27;s so think; one bottle lasts me about a year!</li>
    <li> I had taken a long break from this conditioner, and just came back to it after considering getting keratin treatment for my fine frizzy wavy hair (but being reluctant to put chemicals in my hair).  This is THE BEST conditioner around for getting frizz out that I&#x27;ve tried.  Smells great, and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have used Bumble and Bumble shampoo and conditioner for years.  I have very thick, coarse, dry hair, with a mind of its own. The Bumble and Bumble products keep my hair feeling soft and keep it in place.      GCS</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t blow my mind.  Buy moisture maniac if you really want to see result and its  aquarter of the price.</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;ve been consistently using the Coco conditioner, my stylist always comments how healthy my hair is.  I&#x27;ve been out of my Coco for awhile and using other [salon] products...nothing compares (and I&#x27;m now getting the \\&quot;your hair seems dry--needs conditioned\\&quot; comments).  I just bought the big bottle today off the Bumble website.  Totally worth it. Can&#x27;t wait to have my healthy, shiny, soft hair back!</li>
    <li> While at the Salon my shampoo person massaged this into my hair for about a million years and it felt and smelled like heaven. ( which is odd since this is not a scent I normally am drawn to outside of the beach) I believe this is what led me to thinking it was super fabulous and then the purchase of product.  I was smart ( ??? how smart is 8 bucks for a mini bottle of conditioner, I am so warped) and only purchased a mini of this and then the Gentle Shampoo, (which I like quite a bit)   I like the way it feels in the shower, I try to recreate the massaging and the saturation, but afterwords it&#x27;s while drying it&#x27;s not that special, my hair is harder to detangle,the ends are really dry, and it isn&#x27;t really that soft like say after Pureology. It does leave it shiny.When I blowdry it&#x27;s awful, airdry it&#x27;s just ok, texture wise. It tends to leave me frizzy after the blowdryer. Not a good hair day in the making,  so darn. It just feels coated, untamed and odd.  I don&#x27;t hate it to death...., but for me it was a miss all things considered. What a waste ( for me) of an insanely good scent.</li>
    <li> I love all B&amp;B products and this conditioner keeps my hair healthy and prevents my extremely long and thick wavy hair from getting too dry.</li>
    <li> Love B &amp; B!  This is a wonderful Product!</li>
    <li> It seemed just like a normal conditioner There was nothing fantastic about it, expect for the smell. And the price for it is ridiculous, i spent 40 bucks on both the shampoo and conditioner, for those tiny little bottles, that are pretty much travel size. The price is not worth the quantity that you get for it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the feel of this conditioner.  Have already purchased a 2nd bottle!</li>
    <li> I have thick, medium to coarse brown hair and this conditioner is perfect for that type of texture. It has worked well for me when I had shoulder-lenghth hair, and it works great with my currently short cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner does a great job of absorbing into the hair follicle making it really soft, yet it never makes my hair feel or look weighed down. I think it has contributed to the overall shine and health of my hair. The coconut smell is amazing, and it manages not to smell like suntan lotion which is good. Only a small amount is needed to be effective, but I would recommend leaving it on your hair for at least 30 seconds for it to work, otherwise you will just be rinsing it down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate this conditioner with other brands to mix things up, and this product is always the best. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Bumble and Bumble shampoo and conditioner for over a year now, and my hair is alway super soft.  Also I have dyed hair and I have noticed that it has helped keep the color long then any other shampoo I have every used.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have nice healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I love bumble products and this is one of their best ones. Smells amazing and makes hair shiny and more manageable . It smells like coconuts .</li>
    <li> I love it.  My hair was dry and looked like flour, and this helped quite a bit.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy film over my head after rinsing it off.</li>
    <li> This product feels great to use and has good results for me. This was my second bottle and plan to continue use.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the one I&#x27;ll repurchase over and over again. Aside from leaving your hair smelling absolutely fantastic, it does a great job at keeping hair healthy.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for years from my salon. I thought I would buy it online to save a trip to my salon. Considering how often I use this product, I noticed right away that the color was off. Then when I used it, it was obvious that the product was fake considering the consistency was very different. Finally when I used it, my hair was full of knots and unusually dry. I&#x27;m disappointed that I bought two bottles. Please, please be aware that Deal Seakers is selling FAKE Bumble and Bumble products! Unacceptable.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. When you use a shampoo that really dries out your hair, this conditioner puts moisture right back in. It does not feel greasy. You only need an amount in the size of a dime, or more if you have longer hair. It smells great and is a great product.</li>
    <li> For several days after using the conditioner, my hair has been left very tangled and frizzy so much so that my hair breaks when I comb it.  I purchased the largest size so this is unfortunate.  Perhaps it isn&#x27;t the real Bumble and Bumble as other unsatisfied reviewers have noted.  Either way, I would not recommend this conditioner based on my experience.</li>
    <li> Only conditioner that makes my hair smooth and young. GreAt smell . Four star only because of cost, I but can&#x27;t find a cheaper alternative</li>
    <li> This makes your hair feel so silk.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Beware in purchasing this item.  The viscosity and texture of the product is inconsistent with Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s typical high quality shampoos/conditioners.  My hair did not respond the way it usually does to B&amp;B (it was more like the effect of using a cheap hotel hair product).  Although the fragrance seemed 100% spot-on, I still returned the product based on my suspicion that it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy hair with tough tangles. This product has eased my mornings. I love it, but it&#x27;s difficult to find anymore.</li>
    <li> I have used B&amp;B products in the past with \\&quot;ok\\&quot; results. Despite the price, I decided to try Creme De Cocoa because my hair tends to be dry, and it is wavy so when I dry it straight, I often get \\&quot;pouf\\&quot;. I do not wash my hair every day, I also have highlights. The conditioner is ok, . It smells great. It just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything spectacular to my hair to justify the price. It&#x27;s \\&quot;ok\\&quot;. I probably won&#x27;t get it again though.</li>
    <li> I have a LOT of thick semi-curly/wavy brown hair that i like to wear curly and straighten on the ends to make it lay a bit better. Often times i just use Pantene curly hair shampoo/conditioner, but Bumble and Bumble Creme de Coco is my favorite by far when i can afford it. And with Amazon, i can!    I will use this once or twice per week to add some extra moisture to my dry hair from straightening. It&#x27;s also a heavier shampoo/conditioner and great for making curls and waves lay the right way. And i get a lot of compliments on how nice my hair smells (like coconut).    I ordered this product and had no problems with it. And it was mailed very quickly. Love it!</li>
    <li> I knew this was a great product before I bought it having used it before. The reason I bought ii from where I did was because of the great price. The product came well packed with minimal packaging. I had ordered another product and they sent the wrong one, but were courteous and prompt about sending the replacement. I would definitely do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware..We&#x27;ve used this product for several years, both shampoo and conditioner.  However, the product purchased via Amazon was definitely not the same as that purchased directly from Bumble and Bumble or our local salon.  The consistency, quality and formula was definitely of a lesser grade that dried out our hair and left a residue.  I thought I was the only one to notice, but my husband independently mentioned he stopped using the bottle.  Key message...save your money and buy directly from Bumble and Bumble or your local salon!</li>
    <li> As with the shampoo, I have bleached platinum hair and this line smells great and keeps my hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a Christmas gift, for a relative. They loved the smell. Do not know if it worked for them but with winter &amp; heated dry air, upon us  I expect they will enjoy this conditioner.</li>
    <li> One of the best conditioners ever, and it smells great too.  It makes my hair so soft and smooth, helps with frizzes and the smell is fabulous but doesn&#x27;t overpower</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for almost 10 years and like it very much. The vanilla scent is very fragrant without being overpowering.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  The delivery was fast and the price was good.</li>
    <li> Sorry I thought I rated this product already.  This made my hair feel like straw.  I did not like this at all.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> My hair feels amazing when I use this, smells great. It&#x27;s a little pricey so I use it sparingly for special occasions</li>
    <li> I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner because my salon is now using Bumble and Bumble products and my stylist was raving about the products.  The coconut smell is great but the shampoo and conditioner are just ok.  I thought that it would make my hair smooth and give it more shine, but my hair feels like I am using a cheap supermarket brand shampoo.  Also, my forehead seems to be a little on the oily side since I started using these products.  I normally have very dry skin with no blemishes.  I am kinda disappointed because I spent $50 on both the shampoo and conditioner.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again...</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner - recommended by my hair stylist when she heard I was using a Pantene conditioner.  I use this with the Bb Gentle Shampoo because I have curly hair with blonde highlights that can feel dry (particularly in the summer when out at the beach and in the sun). This conditioner does what I imagine a conditioner should - it adds moisture, makes it easier to comb through my curls when they are wet, and it smells AMAZING :) I only deducted a star because I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but until I find something this good that&#x27;s cheaper, I imagine I will continue to pay for it.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive but a dimes worth does the job and I love the coconut oil/scent getting harder to find</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great for dry, damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Great coconut sent</li>
    <li> Basically most bumble &amp; bumble products are all amazing but I absolutely LOVE the smell of the creme de coco &amp; it leaves my hair soft &amp; shiny :)  --- I have thin, fine hair for those looking for a good conditioner I def recommend!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it when I use this shampoo &amp; conditioner. My local stores are always out, and that is why Amazon works. I can order online.</li>
