<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! Makes my hair soft shiny and manageable</li>
    <li> Really like this product a lot. I have natural curly hair, it takes away frizz and gives great shine without any weight or stickiness.</li>
    <li> I like using this product for my hair when I wear it curly. When I wear it straight I prefer to use another product because this on leaves my hair and brush a little greesy. But I love it on my curly hair!  It allows me to brush right through my tangles and knots, keeps the frizz and fly aways to a minimum and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like other products.</li>
    <li> This 10 scores a 10 with me and it far exceeded my expectations for curling my hair.  Not greasy,stiff or sticky!</li>
    <li> THE BEST EVER!!!!  Completely helps with spit ends and flyaways... be sure to put on just a dime size when wet head and then blow dry in...</li>
    <li> Great product and a really great price!</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time and the product is consistent with the other helpful reviews I&#x27;ve read. I&#x27;m %100 satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Always had knots with my curly hair but not anymore.  This stuff is great</li>
    <li> Love this potion it is so light and feels so great and a little bit goes a long way.  My hair feels soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller! Would highly recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses it, so Imdecided to try it.  I really like it, makes my hair smoother.....a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Look no further. THIS is what you need. I have been on a search for many years for the perfect blow dry cream &amp; I truly believe I&#x27;ve found it. Being a hairstylist myself, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try just about everything on the market and this is the only product that has been able to meet my criteria... Not too heavy, truly reduces styling time, reduces frizz, creates shine, heals damage.... Literally made my fried hair feel brand new. I have very thick, course hair. It does not straiten easily. I parted my hair into sections and used 3 dime size amounts of this product in my hair. Sectioning my hair is a non negotiable due to the amount of hair I have especially if I want the product to be spread evenly. After I applied the product I combed it through to further assure even coverage root to end. I then let my hair air dry for a couple hours (which means nothing because takes 24 hours for my hair to dry on its own) and eventually took a blow dryer &amp; round brush to it. It was dry and smooth in 15 minutes. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Really relaxes my curls.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product! Keeps my hair from being freezy when I straighten it.</li>
    <li> I use the entire It&#x27;s a 10 line, and when something new comes out...you bet I&#x27;ve got it stashed under the sink. The thing about this line is that is truly does work. When you have to balance between moisture and protein for your damaged hair, these products hit both extremely well and leave your hair smelling great too! That being said, the styling potion is one of my favorites. It leaves your hair extremely silky and soft and NO buildup. I use it on dry or wet hair to give my hair an added major boost of moisture. And a little goes a long way, this tube is still full after four months! I&#x27;m a hair dye/platinum doo junkie and this is one of my weapons in the combat of damaged hair I keep in my arsenal!</li>
    <li> I LOVE &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products&amp;#34;, and this one is in my LOVE list!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It has helped my damaged hair better than anything!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My hair is wavy and frizzy, and this product works on it like it&#x27;s nothing. It has a delectable scent as well!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair so soft. I like it better applied to dry hair. My favorite hair product and I have tried a lot!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product.  It also smooths my thick hair and helps keep it styled.  It makes styling so much easier.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Greasy on fine curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product and here&#x27;s the reasons why: I have fine, thinning yet wavy hair. A very difficult combination to find the right hair styling product, but 10 Miracle Styling Potion turned out to be the perfect one for my hair. It adds fullness to my fine hair, the perfect amount of control as well as a little bit of shine and isn&#x27;t sticky. My hair-stylist introduced this product to me and I&#x27;m so thankful she did! I hope they never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Makes your hair soft and shiny, protects against heat and smells great.</li>
    <li> Love it! Super fas shipping</li>
    <li> I had never tried &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products before, until my hair stylist used this in my hair.  I figured it must be pretty good stuff because the salon doesn&#x27;t even sell &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products there, yet she was using it in my hair.  So, I decided to order some for myself!  I have used this to blow dry my hair and also for air-dried styles.  It works great for both.  It makes my hair really soft and tangle-free!  I really recommend it as a leave in product, especially if you have longer hair and your ends tend to get a little dry.  I use this when my hair is wet, and I use the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Dry Oil Spray&amp;#34; for when my hair is dry.  I have become a really big fan of &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products in the past couple of weeks!  One thing I will say about the styling potion:  When you first use it, be careful because the hole the product comes out of is bigger than you would think.  I squirted waaaaay too much into my hand the first time I used it and didn&#x27;t want to waste the product, so I put it all in my hair and my hair got really oily.  So, be gentle when you squeeze the product out.  If you have long hair, you really only need maybe a (small) marble sized amount.</li>
    <li> Like this stuff but like the daily 10 leave in better. Too much weighs my hair down but I will use it more in the winter I am sure.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Very light weight not greasy. The only thing that tames frizz for me</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it.  I have natural curly hair that frizz&#x27;s easily.  I put this on after my hair is dry.  It give my hair shine, takes away the frizz and defines my curls.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter loves curling her hair.  She has highlights and its hard to find a product to leave it without it weighing hair down. I am a huge product junkie and have to admit this is one of my favorite products.  Even over the bumble and bumble repair blow out cream.</li>
    <li> I love this styling potion. Makes my hair soft &amp; shiny, and keeps it under control.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have ever used, I would recommend this to anyone, it makes my hair super soft, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, gives it a beautiful shine, &amp; with me having fine hair, it doesn&#x27;t make it oily whatsoever, I seriously loooooove it :))</li>
    <li> This styling potion is super great!! Does not leave a residue on hair and works well with my styling wand!!</li>
    <li> My stylist recently turned me onto this! Best it&#x27;s a 10 product yet! Totally blocked out humidity. I have highlighted fine blonde very curly hair. I can easily straighten or take my curling iron to my hair now and  hair is soft, silky and smooth!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so amazing.  I have hair like straw.  This product completely changes the texture into soft, manageable hair.</li>
    <li> The styling potion makes my hair very soft and manageable.  My hair feels like silk.  It takes very little product to achieve the desired result.  The smell is very pleasant.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff, it tames my thick frizzy hair everyday and I can&#x27;t go without it! It really does what it says it will!</li>
    <li> Bought this the other day from my local professional supply store (I&#x27;m a hairstylist) and wanted to try it on myself before I used it on my clients. I have fine, heavily highlighted hair that&#x27;s always dry and tangles like crazy, so I&#x27;m always on the look out for new products for myself and my clients too. I&#x27;ve used  the Its a Ten leave in conditioner, shampoo, mask and other items on my clients for many years and have always loved them and this product is no different than the rest! It adds so much shine to sometimes dull blondes and helps with tangles IMMENSELY!! It gave my flat, fine hair noticable bounce and volume and of course smells great. My clients have loved it too. If you are looking for a new product, definitely give this one a try.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Keeps the same flat ironed look for 2 days after blowing out.</li>
    <li> this tube will last a long time because a little bit goes a long long way with this stuff! Don&#x27;t get any near your roots because it will make your really greasy, but when used properly on the length of the hair, I can&#x27;t tell you how much it made me love my hair. (I have hair that&#x27;s cut just above my shoulders and I use a teeny tiny bit-about 3/4 the size of a dime)&lt;br /&gt;a salon owning friend of mine used it when she cut my hair and I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing my hair looked and felt. Soft without being staticky, the ends look healthy, and shiny. I actually like this much better than the original &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave in Spray&amp;#34;. with that product, it was too heavy to spray on my hair so I&#x27;d squirt some in my hands, rub them together and style as usual&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I wish this stuff would have been around 13yrs ago when I had (horrible frizzy) hair down to my tailbone, I don&#x27;t think I would have chopped off as much because this stuff really transforms your hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Ulta on a whim and I am so glad that I did. I love using it before I blow dry my hair it leaves it soft and silky but not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have very fine hair that easily gets weighed down with too much product but has major static issues with no styling product. This makes my hair super soft, helps with de-tangling, and doesnt weigh it down at all. I especially love this because I can use it if I blow dry my hair but it also works its magic if i just let my hair air dry. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Always leaves my hair shiny and with little frizz</li>
    <li> This is the best styling product ever!!  I used to have to use 2 to 3 products to get the results of this one.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite hair care product.  It smells amazing, gets my hair super shiny and smooth when used before a blow out, and is reasonably priced.  My only annoyance, and it&#x27;s a minor one, is with the tube itself.  It&#x27;s always falling over and knocking my other products over.  If this came in a bottle with a pump, it would be perfect.  As it is, it&#x27;s still pretty perfect and I will be buying it again and again.</li>
    <li> If you have very curly or wavy hair, this is the product for you! Tames curls into a soft more manageable look and feel.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!! Makes my hair very soft..</li>
    <li> smells amazing and makes hair so soft</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s main benefit, for me, is it keeps curly hair from frizzing when being air dried.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Love how it feels in my hair.</li>
    <li> right on time. great product.</li>
    <li> Its a 10 is a great product. My hair tangles very easily and this product does the job!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have thick, coarse, curly hair.  I actually used this product after flat ironing my hair.  It is not greasy.  It is the best product I have used for shine and eliminating frizz.  I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on my hair at my last appointment. We were both amazed at the softness it gave my hair. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since!</li>
    <li> The one thing from its a ten I loved best of all is the spray leave in condish.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t as good as that, but still good!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have waist length, highlighted hair, so it almost takes a miracle product to soften.&lt;br /&gt;So-I think this product is indeed good!</li>
