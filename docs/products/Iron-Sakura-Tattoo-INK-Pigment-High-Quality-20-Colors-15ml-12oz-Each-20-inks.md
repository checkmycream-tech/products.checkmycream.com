      <li>they just put a popular name brand logo on them and people buy it for the name brand,</li>
      <li>Here is the deal, I read a bunch of reviews saying these inks do not sit well in the skin and was kind of worried.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very very very watery but are good and bright</li>
      <li>The ink went in smooth and bright.</li>
      <li>When I ordered this I figured cheap ink, probably not as good as some.  </li>
      <li>I should of kept the ink set would work very fine with the tats I do now</li>
      <li>the comments have convinced me this is good ink,and i&#x27;ve heard this ink was quality ink for a while now,and its got a good  name,i&#x27;m going to give it try and the price its great for quality ink,because some of that 9.00 of ounce ink is over rated,and not what they make it out to be,you are paying for the name,like cloths,made in the same factory ,and you pay more for the brand name</li>
      <li>Good quality inks that take to skin really well, also a good selection of colours</li>
      <li>I got them and they are fine!</li>
      <li>He plans to buy more when he uses up this set.</li>
      <li>okay.....</li>
      <li>love all the colors you get</li>
      <li>He was satisfied with the texture of the ink and the colors in the ink set.</li>
      <li>So far these inks stick good, and they show up good once the tattoo heals up.</li>
      <li>iv used some 5ml hao ink thats way better then this.....</li>
      <li>I wish I would have purchased a better quality product.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this ink.</li>
      <li>Got these for my boy , he&#x27;s very happy with it and actually going to do some work with them today.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better ink at this price.</li>
      <li>Used the ink the same day got it, and it sets on the skin great and the person loved the tattoo.  </li>
      <li>Overall ink quality is excellent though...</li>
      <li>Lovely assortment of colors, but I was hoping to get more shades of purple than this included...</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d rather spend a couple more bucks on better stuff👎</li>
      <li>there are a lot better inks out there</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t see y people say that it does take to skin great buy thanks</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more from this company</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the after care that screws with coloring, if people would actually listen to us tattooist on after care then their tats would look awesome.</li>
      <li>Might have even been better off.</li>
      <li>Nice bold colors that hold well.</li>
      <li>Have already tried the ink out and it holds very well, beautiful coloring and looks great on the skin, definitely will buy more, and was shipped out quickly!</li>
      <li>these inks are supposed to look like a good deal, but none of them really lasted strong like many name brands.</li>
      <li>this ink dose not go into the skin good at all....is very watery ink as well.....</li>
      <li>The ink is just too watery yet clogs the tips easily.</li>
      <li>This ink hold in the skin easy</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how well they hold up on real flesh as I use more high end brands on clients, but they have great color tones and brightness on my practice flesh</li>
      <li>I use a little bit of it of the ink awesome item</li>
      <li>It comes out smooth and clear and bright.</li>
      <li>(I make my own gelatine skins to mimic porosity and elasticity of real skin)...</li>
      <li>so far ive used the reds, blues, and greens all were bright</li>
      <li>After it heals they are incredibly light.  </li>
      <li>Yes there are better inks out there, that also cost a whole lot more money.</li>
      <li>It really is a good pack for the money and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
      <li>, I bought this ink to replenish the ink I had been using and the difference is amazing, vibrant colors</li>
      <li>The first couple of tattoos were okay</li>
      <li>but if you are a tattooist you know what i&#x27;m saying is true.  </li>
      <li>Not bad beginner ink.</li>
      <li>ALL...if your gonna spend money on a good tattoo machine, why not good ink?  I made the mistake but won&#x27;t again that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
      <li>i was hoping this ink was going to be somewhat good, but for the price i guess there is no complaing, i was hoping the black was going to be darker</li>
      <li>Ink was a little runny and the color didnt look as good on the skin.</li>
      <li>It was a small box inside of a bigger box with that bubble packing plastic stuff around it which was great!</li>
      <li>The ink is very watery!</li>
      <li>Being a first time do-it-yourself-tattooist</li>
      <li>The packaging was VERY well done!</li>
      <li>THANKS!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The inks themselves are in real good shape, they look thick enough (please note</li>
      <li>The ink was made real cheap and it was to watered down</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be returning to my good old Kumo Sumi for my black and MOM&#x27;s or Starbright or something for the color.</li>
      <li>the ink is really watery and doesn&#x27;t stay well in the skin at all.</li>
      <li>However the ink is very watery and did not take.</li>
      <li>IF there are any real issues, I&#x27;ll let ya</li>
      <li>You need to really pack it in and that causes too much trauma to skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I ordered this I figured cheap ink, probably not as good as some.  But turns out I am super impressed.  The ink saturates great and stays in the skin great.  You don&#x27;t often find this kind of quality for such a low price.  I would definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> The majority of these InkS were awful!!!!  Very few held nicely. The rest ..... I might as well have used food coloring..... diluted with water. Might have even been better off. I&#x27;m known for my color saturation and have not had one tattoo yet that didn&#x27;t need to be touched up. Not to mention i was literally telling people to come back when they healed so i could go back over it, to keep from turning people to hamburger!!!! Just embarrassing.</li>
    <li> These are what i was looking for. The size of the ink is great.</li>
    <li> only inks that work are red and orange  everything else is crap. do not buy these inks i recommend intenze or eternal inks. not too pricey but will go into any skin</li>
    <li> I was just mentioning this set in a review for a different product. It was &amp;#34;Mom&#x27;s&amp;#34; black ink. The black that came with this set is soooo much darker and way better. If you&#x27;re a starting tattooist you cannot go wrong with this price and variety. I used the ink in the photo attached.</li>
    <li> the ink is really watery and doesn&#x27;t stay well in the skin at all. the colors are not very good either very unsatisfied with them</li>
    <li> this is good ink the skin holds it well. when it arrived 1 bottle had leaked contacted sellar he shipped out a replace met package with out any problems I will use this product again and will use this shipper again.</li>
    <li> my skin had a reaction to this ink. watch out. it may work on some people but color fades fast</li>
    <li> very fast shippment,very wonderful product,highly reconmend. very wonderful communication and will defiently use agian. i was impressed with how well the colors took to my skin</li>
    <li> Bought for my granddaughter.  She loves the colors but wishes the bottles were larger.  Have been on the lookout for larger bottles.</li>
    <li> if you like dull colors or shaking the bottles for 10 minutes before, and during tattooing then this is a must have product. not pleased at all. weak color and poor pigment. would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great...all colors are as stated. Don&#x27;t see y people say that it does take to skin great buy thanks</li>
    <li> The product is of great quality. I was not sure what to expect but was glad I ordered this brand. It comes out smooth and clear and bright.</li>
    <li> Good quality inks that take to skin really well, also a good selection of colours, I bought this ink to replenish the ink I had been using and the difference is amazing, vibrant colors and it takes without going over the same spot multiple times, this ink also goes a long way, I only needed half the amount of this ink compared to my old ones, I gaurantee I will be using this ink on all my tattoos from now on, Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> i was hoping this ink was going to be somewhat good, but for the price i guess there is no complaing, i was hoping the black was going to be darker but it really wasnt and some colors didnt work</li>
    <li> I choose a 4 because I wish it came in 1oz or 2oz bottles. The ink went in smooth and bright. The white was ok, but white is a tricky color to get right. I have see a lot of people who said the color didn&#x27;t stick or faded. Has for color not sticking I believe it to be one of 2 things technique &amp;#34; tattooing 101 a 45degree angle and tight circles.&amp;#34; 2nd machine speed. Over all I would use this ink!!!</li>
    <li> There a re a few colors, such as the lighter green that fade almost immediately due to being watery. But all in all a good deal.</li>
    <li> this ink is like water was very hard to use runny . it would be nice if you made good on this purchase</li>
    <li> dont buy it. these inks are supposed to look like a good deal, but none of them really lasted strong like many name brands. dont spend the money</li>
    <li> i bought this as a gift so i cant speak for the quailty but if and when i can i will do an edit!! i gave this a 5 because it was a great price and i ordered it the week before Christmas and i had it in 3 days!! also the inks came neatly packeged and there were no spills or leaks!!and everything was just in great condition!! so for these reasons i had to give it a 5!!! you get a great deal for the price!! hope you enjoy it!!</li>
    <li> Works really good but it&#x27;s very very very watery but are good and bright my costumes love em and they have not GeV me any bad feed back</li>
    <li> Great for my buisness</li>
    <li> love all the colors you get</li>
    <li> Garbage....this ink dose not go into the skin good at all....is very watery ink as well.....spend the extra few bucks...iv used some 5ml hao ink thats way better then this.....if coukd give a zero it would def.get a zero star rateing</li>
    <li> I should of kept the ink set would work very fine with the tats I do now</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this ink. Being a first time do-it-yourself-tattooist I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better ink at this price. The packaging was undamaged which was a big plus. I recommend this ink.</li>
    <li> Used the ink the same day got it, and it sets on the skin great and the person loved the tattoo.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice bold colors that hold well.</li>
    <li> Honestly cheap, watery and if you have dark skin doesn&#x27;t show up well, I&#x27;d rather spend a couple more bucks on better stuff👎</li>
    <li> there are a lot better inks out there so shop around..  I like intenze ink.  It is very good, the skin takes it good and it stays bright</li>
    <li> Very nice. I got every color I needed and with the hurry too.</li>
    <li> Great array of colors. My son has not used the colors yet, but I do like the wide selection.</li>
    <li> This has to be toxic.&lt;br /&gt;I experienced swelling, and what looked to be like a terrible skin reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I personally thought it was the worst ink ever! I have other tattoos, and my leg is still currently healing from the effects of this ink. The ink was so harsh that after the infection in my leg begin to ease up, my body physically rejected the ink, and begin to do everything possible to  rid my skin of the ink. I was left with a hole in my leg that went the depth of the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;I was highly upset with the aftermath. Now I am left with nothing but a healing wound.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the ink it too watery.&lt;br /&gt; I can not say that this will happen to everyone who uses this ink, but it leaves me wondering what the hell is in this stuff.</li>
    <li> Have already tried the ink out and it holds very well, beautiful coloring and looks great on the skin, definitely will buy more, and was shipped out quickly!</li>
    <li> great ink, sticks good and im really happy with it.i&#x27;ll be staying with this product,iron sukura.i&#x27;ll be buying it all the time,you all should do the same, or try it out al least.</li>
    <li> this is the ink that is tainted with bacteria that causes stalf infections, needs to be pulled off the shelf its a health hazzard everyone</li>
    <li> Here is the deal, I read a bunch of reviews saying these inks do not sit well in the skin and was kind of worried. I got them and they are fine! I would say they are just the same as any other ink ive used. I think some of these people just have a hard time setting color in the skin and are blaming the ink. so far ive used the reds, blues, and greens all were bright and if you need to they mix well. Ive been tattooing in a shop environment for 6 years and these inks are about the same consistency as other inks I&#x27;ve used. Dont be fooled by fancy labeling and crap, even the most expensive ink is made of the same shit. As for the consistency of the ink, I had no running of ink, if you guys got ink running all over a client like \\&quot;water off a ducks back\\&quot; your doing something wrong yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INK IS FINE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ITS DIRT CHEAP!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be a fool not to give this a shot. Worked for me! and \\&quot;ORENGE\\&quot; brings me back to tattooing in Korea and Japan. THANKS!</li>
    <li> So far these inks stick good, and they show up good once the tattoo heals up. Very happy with the purchase thank you.</li>
    <li> The Good: None of the inks were spilled like others said. The packaging was VERY well done! It was a small box inside of a bigger box with that bubble packing plastic stuff around it which was great! The inks themselves are in real good shape, they look thick enough (please note \\&quot;The Bad\\&quot;), and the labels are clear to read (please note \\&quot;The Ugly\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: A couple of the inks LOOK watery but I haven&#x27;t had to use those colors yet. I can&#x27;t do anything but speculate about the consistency of them but they do LOOK very watered down. So far, that&#x27;s the only let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly: Yes, some are watery but the only ugly about this was the labels... I understand that these are manufactured in Taiwan but they DO have spell check. Orenge is not correct. Thankfully, that&#x27;s all I got for this category. Just change the spelling on some of the labels and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, buy this pack. It really is a good pack for the money and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues. IF there are any real issues, I&#x27;ll let ya know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 10/22/12: Used the inks this weekend. They are runny and don&#x27;t hold in the skin well at all. I won&#x27;t buy these inks again unfortunately and now I&#x27;ll have to redo some work in a few weeks. The orange and the golden barely went through the skin, the yellow ran off like water off a ducks back, and the black was SURPISINGLY gray. It looked like I was shading for an outline and I&#x27;m not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be returning to my good old Kumo Sumi for my black and MOM&#x27;s or Starbright or something for the color. This ink has been pretty much worthless though everything above about the packaging still holds true except me saying to buy the pack. Its not worth it. The ink is just too watery yet clogs the tips easily. How that works, I don&#x27;t know. This is the first ink I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ll never use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but truth be told this ink sucks ass.</li>
    <li> I bought Iron Sakura Tattoo ink as a birthday present for a friend who also received a tattoo gun from his wife. He was satisfied with the texture of the ink and the colors in the ink set. He plans to buy more when he uses up this set.</li>
    <li> Wonderful ink. The color stays well and mixes nicely. It&#x27;s not too thick, not too thin and has a good pigment count.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter to use. She said she was happy with them. That&#x27;s all I can tell you!</li>
    <li> The ink is really watery it&#x27;s too thin whatever they did to make more they did way too much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really trusting of these inks because of the ratings I&#x27;ve seen on different sights concerning them for being used on clients.  So I use them as practice inks since they are inexpensive and it allows me to still hone my tattooing techniques and shading.  I don&#x27;t know how well they hold up on real flesh as I use more high end brands on clients, but they have great color tones and brightness on my practice flesh (I make my own gelatine skins to mimic porosity and elasticity of real skin)... but if they hold up as well on real flesh, for the price, I don&#x27;t see why a person wouldn&#x27;t want to invest in this set.  It&#x27;s a nice set and packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> I had a little problem with the ink when using it.  I had a hard time with people not taking the ink but a friend of mine is doing well with it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic inks, never had a single problem with any of them. Used them on several tattoos and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Got these for my boy , he&#x27;s very happy with it and actually going to do some work with them today. Great delivery time ,no leaks or damages. I myself have used and still do use Iron Sakura Tattoo ink, and they work great. It&#x27;s the after care that screws with coloring, if people would actually listen to us tattooist on after care then their tats would look awesome.</li>
    <li> The ink is very watery! It runs underneath the skin! You&#x27;ll have a really hard time trying to get it to sit! Limited colors and just overall poor quality! Great customer service though!</li>
    <li> This ink does not go into the skin very well.  The first couple of tattoos were okay but now the product just sucks.  I wish I would have purchased a better quality product.  The ink that did stick in the beginning is now fading and looks horrible. I will never purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This ink was not what i expected. If you want to practice on fake s*** its okay..... not so go for skin ... colors just didnt pop</li>
    <li> The ink is so watery. it was a runny mess and I will not use it again. The color is already faded looking.</li>
    <li> I like how some of the colors lay but the lighter colors like white, ghost white, red, light green, and light brown, is way too light and is barely noticeable...plus the black lightens up after the scabbing, I&#x27;m having to get some darker, higher quality ink to do touch-ups.....</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect!! 👍 thank you!</li>
    <li> The ink was made real cheap and it was to watered down</li>
    <li> On time and what was expected</li>
    <li> Ink was a little runny and the color didnt look as good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I thought when I purchased this ink it was going to be a so-so product. It actually works very well, I was inpressed with the quality and price. Yes there are better inks out there, that also cost a whole lot more money. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this ink prior to purchasing and decided to try it.The packaging and shipping speed was great.However the ink is very watery and did not take.It was about like doing a tattoo with food coloring.I will now have to do the tattoo again with different ink after it heals.My customer is not happy</li>
    <li> the comments have convinced me this is good ink,and i&#x27;ve heard this ink was quality ink for a while now,and its got a good  name,i&#x27;m going to give it try and the price its great for quality ink,because some of that 9.00 of ounce ink is over rated,and not what they make it out to be,you are paying for the name,like cloths,made in the same factory ,and you pay more for the brand name they just put a popular name brand logo on them and people buy it for the name brand,i&#x27;ve noticed ink s the same way,because i&#x27;ve tried alot of them high brands ink and they are not that good,some of its diluted i&#x27;m not calling no names but if you are a tattooist you know what i&#x27;m saying is true.  crazy rick</li>
    <li> Not bad beginner ink. Did a few cool things with this ink</li>
    <li> good color variety and they set just fine small bottles but thats what you get for the $</li>
    <li> Product was delivered a lot sooner then expected! So Far great Black Ink and red Ink! Still trying the other colors but it looks like it was a great sale! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. The black becomes grey after a day or two. The brown worked alright. The red yellow and white were like water and wouldn&#x27;t even stick. By morning the color was gone. I would not recommend this ink to anyone, and I won&#x27;t be buying it again. Thankfully I tested it on myself and not a client, otherwise this ink could have cost me a lot of money and reputation.</li>
    <li> Not good ink, ppl say watery but mine were like sludge.  Not just that but the colors don&#x27;t transfer to skin vibrantly.  You need to really pack it in and that causes too much trauma to skin.  After it heals they are incredibly light.  DO NOT BUY AT ALL...if your gonna spend money on a good tattoo machine, why not good ink?  I made the mistake but won&#x27;t again that&#x27;s for sure.  Look into Intenze, Skin candy, Moms.</li>
    <li> The ink fades quick after being used i think i will spend a little more money on the ink next time</li>
    <li> Lovely assortment of colors, but I was hoping to get more shades of purple than this included...Overall ink quality is excellent though...I only gave it just 4 stars because of the lack of Purples..</li>
    <li> I use a little bit of it of the ink awesome item</li>
    <li> Missing labels/Some were damaged.</li>
    <li> This ink hold in the skin easy the red was just right I will be ordering more from this company</li>
