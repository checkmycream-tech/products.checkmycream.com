<li> It doesn&#x27;t really match my hair which is a dark brown.</li>
<li> They showed up just fine, but COMPLETELY the wrong color.</li>
<li> and they didn&#x27;t take long to put in and still have tones left</li>
<li> Way higher quality than those ive used in the past and about a fifth of the price!</li>
<li> I only marked down one star due to it being lighter than the picture.</li>
<li> it was a dark blonde maybe little brown or tan color no where near color it showed or said it was!!</li>
<li> I wish it didn&#x27;t take as long to get here.</li>
<li> I actually got them a week and half later.</li>
<li> The color is less noticeable in my brown hair than the normal black beads, and they hold up extremely well.</li>
<li> I ordered the blonde, brown and black.</li>
<li> Took a little longer to get here, but thats to be expected when travelling such a distance.</li>
<li> I bought these for my stylist along with some extreme color extensions.</li>
<li> Chose dark brown for extensions numbers 4 and 6.&lt;br /&gt;Adicta from the Poconos</li>
<li> These are black.</li>
<li> I cannot tell the difference between black and brown.  </li>
<li> Are not brown, they are black.  </li>
<li> and then they begin to slowly slide down the hair strands within 3-5 days</li>
<li> Not thrilled</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if they sent me the wrong item or if the color is just off in the picture</li>
<li> Was not happy since I was doing them on a med brown hair</li>

    <li> Love these! They&#x27;re silicone lined so won&#x27;t damage your hair if you put heat on them. I only marked down one star due to it being lighter than the picture. It doesn&#x27;t really match my hair which is a dark brown.</li>
    <li> On time and right amount</li>
    <li> Pleased with product for the most part, just took longer . About 1 week over the time promised.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, and they came very quickly, and in expected condition. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and they came promptly. Great quality, too!  Loved the price and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Normally hair feather extensions last 1 to 2 months.  With these microlinks, the feathers were falling out within 1-2 DAYS and I had to return my customers&#x27; money.  I am throwing out the remaining links I purchased from here and will never use them again.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!! Which I was surprised, because normally this product is well over $70 and I had purchased them for $5... shipping included! Took a little longer to get here, but thats to be expected when travelling such a distance. Thanks a bunch:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was a good purchase I will be buying soon!  I wish it didn&#x27;t take as long to get here.</li>
    <li> These beads are great I actually got them very fast so don&#x27;t be discouraged to buy when they say it might take a month I actually got them a week and half later.</li>
    <li> they hold hair very well</li>
    <li> Takes a bit to arrive, but knew that up front and was fine with it.  Same quality as beauty supply house, much better prices.</li>
    <li> Wish the shipping time wasn&#x27;t so long, but I do love these great beads.I use them both on myself and on my clients..and never have problems.</li>
    <li> Great product im a hair extensions specialist</li>
    <li> They showed up just fine, but COMPLETELY the wrong color. These aren&#x27;t brown, they are &amp;#34;light blonde/light brown,&amp;#34; and do not look anything like the photos.</li>
    <li> Do not work well at well!!&lt;br /&gt;They last for a couple days and then they begin to slowly slide down the hair strands within 3-5 days&lt;br /&gt;Very slippery!</li>
    <li> it was a dark blonde maybe little brown or tan color no where near color it showed or said it was!! Was not happy since I was doing them on a med brown hair</li>
    <li> Perfect - just like The description it also came out nice ja&lt;br /&gt;r instead of a plastic bag I would order some of these again</li>
    <li> These work well and are not harsh on the hair. They bend nicely and hold the hair well. We have ordered them twice and will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Beads came on time. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I love these beads, better than sew in&#x27;s and hair glue.  The only thing is too match your hair texture with the weave. Very easy too put in and take out, just takes time.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my stylist along with some extreme color extensions. The color is less noticeable in my brown hair than the normal black beads, and they hold up extremely well. I change my hair often but have kept these in for six weeks at a time with no issues. Great product!</li>
    <li> The size is great, although it took a while to get here. Make sure you have lots of time before you need them.</li>
    <li> I have always bought my daughter hair extentions with the clip in but my daughter wanted to do micro-rings and i was like what she showed a video on youtube and i was like lets try it so we got all the supplies we needed thanks to everyone on amazon and they didn&#x27;t take long to put in and still have tones left make sure you get the color that is closes to your hair tone or might look little funny if does show</li>
    <li> it takes quite some time before the micro links to be delivered, but at the end the price is worth it is so is the quality i will order again soon</li>
    <li> Loved  how easily i was able to put in and adjust my extensions with these. They are strong and very comfortable. Way higher quality than those ive used in the past and about a fifth of the price!</li>
    <li> Are not brown, they are black.  I ordered the blonde, brown and black. I cannot tell the difference between black and brown.  These are black. Not thrilled but I&#x27;m not sending them back to Hong Kong.</li>
    <li> Got them fast then I expected and worked out amazing thank u</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they sent me the wrong item or if the color is just off in the picture but they look more like light brown than dark.</li>
    <li> The price is great. The color is much lighter than the picture. Chose dark brown for extensions numbers 4 and 6.&lt;br /&gt;Adicta from the Poconos</li>
    <li> The beads were very good. I got them right on time. I will definetly keep on purchasing my beadsfrom you guys. I will also order some oher products. Definetly satisfied.</li>
    <li> the color match is perfect. Love it and I am getting ready for my second order! Best price and no complaints with the product</li>
