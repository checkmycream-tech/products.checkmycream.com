### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very good quality.  </li>
      <li>They work great.</li>
      <li>Great for my cosplay outfits.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but am very satisfied with the construction of the straps.</li>
      <li>Love these, my son hasn&#x27;t lost any gloves since I bought them!</li>
      <li>Much better length.</li>
      <li>Works ok.</li>
      <li>So glad to find these.</li>
      <li>These are just so much better than the longer ones for keeping jeans inside your boots.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Everything came in a timely way and the descriptions were accurate.</li>
      <li>You just have to move them until You find a comfortable place for them against your ankle.</li>
      <li>They were delivered on time, however the very first one we used broke before we could ever use it.</li>
      <li>These work great to hold my jeans down in my boots</li>
      <li>Love these for keeping pants pulled down inside boots.</li>
      <li>Despite the metal clip, I am able to use these even in tight boots.</li>
      <li>The other 2 seem fine.</li>
      <li>Only 4 stars because unless you place the clips just right, they can dig into your ankle and it hurts.</li>
      <li>That should more or less hold your pants in place to get your foot into the boot, with minimal pant rising.</li>

<li> I find it strange though that they come in a pack of 3 instead of 2 or 4.</li>
<li> They do work well though for long jeans that touch the floor.</li>
<li> Sturdy, easy to use, have held up all winter in a cold state being used by a five-year-old boy.</li>
<li> They tend to pull my pants down because they aren&#x27;t long enough for jeans that just hit the ankle or a little below.</li>
<li> Longer than I expected,</li>
<li> recommendation, simply use a long, thin nylon sock, and pull it over your leggings/jeans, and then place your leg in your boot.</li>
<li> Low profile clasps hide well and are hard to see under tight clothing.</li>
<li> They do the trick, definitely meant for smaller feet, and by that I mean thin, not shoe size.</li>
<li> And no more looking for lost gloves!</li>
<li> My son is tall but thin and needed these.</li>

    <li> It did what it was suppose to do.</li>

    <li> Bought them for my jeans to wear inside my boots.  Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but am very satisfied with the construction of the straps.</li>
    <li> I wish these were longer. They tend to pull my pants down because they aren&#x27;t long enough for jeans that just hit the ankle or a little below. They do work well though for long jeans that touch the floor. I find it strange though that they come in a pack of 3 instead of 2 or 4.</li>
    <li> Great for my cosplay outfits. Everyone should have these in their closet. Low profile clasps hide well and are hard to see under tight clothing.</li>
    <li> Very good quality.  Used it as a vest fastener.</li>
    <li> My son is tall but thin and needed these. They work great.</li>
    <li> Everything came in a timely way and the descriptions were accurate.</li>
    <li> Work well. Longer than I expected, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Works ok. My son&#x27;s gloves come of from time to time but not often.</li>
    <li> They were delivered on time, however the very first one we used broke before we could ever use it. The other 2 seem fine.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, easy to use, have held up all winter in a cold state being used by a five-year-old boy. And no more looking for lost gloves!</li>
    <li> So glad to find these. I use them to cinch the back of my tops for a tailored look.</li>
    <li> Work for adults as well as children. Much better length.</li>
    <li> They do the trick, definitely meant for smaller feet, and by that I mean thin, not shoe size. They are obviously not adjustable, that was obvious. It didn&#x27;t matter at how I put them on my foot, once in the boot and with some walking, it would eventually move around and put pressure on my ankle, making it quite uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that reason, I have retired these after two attempts in making them work.  Perhaps I shall find another use for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation, simply use a long, thin nylon sock, and pull it over your leggings/jeans, and then place your leg in your boot. That should more or less hold your pants in place to get your foot into the boot, with minimal pant rising.</li>
