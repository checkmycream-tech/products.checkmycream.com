### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;After I figured out a method that works, I am very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall this is an excellent value for a quality brush.</li>
      <li>I was so impressed with it that I ordered one for my brother in law.</li>
      <li>great!</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s impressive.  </li>
      <li>This brush fits the purpose perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about two months, and it is excellent.  </li>
      <li>For a synthetic this is a very good quality brush.</li>
      <li>I got use to the size, I found this to be a very good brush in terms of application.</li>
      <li>It lathers great, feels good in the hand and the best part not made from an animal.</li>
      <li>and it is still in great shape.</li>
      <li>This makes a great lather with any soap I choose to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Appearance: Is the look of the brush attractive?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Its a great brush.</li>
      <li>I have a very nice badger brush, but this one does everything it needs to</li>
      <li>And it feels wonderful on my face, basically my favorite part of shaving.</li>
      <li>A great alternative to badger, and, in my opinion, just as good.  </li>
      <li>It lathers nicely and cleans up great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for bowl lathering or face lathering.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the amount of lather the brush produces as well.</li>
      <li>It seems to be amazing...builds great lather and is way way better than the brush that came with the set I got from Amazon...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the softest brush that I own, even softer than silvertip.  </li>
      <li>I am loving this brush.</li>
      <li>The brush was nice.  </li>
      <li>Nice weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i do think its nicely made and it doesnt shed any hairs.</li>
      <li>It has great water retention, and produces huge quantities of very fine lather using a bowl with either soap or cream, which can then be painted onto the face for a luxurious shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The backbone of this brush is very strong and doesn&#x27;t splay out on the face without a bit of effort&lt;</li>
      <li>This is a great brush and as good as many that cost 3 times as much.</li>
      <li>dries quickly and give good painting strokes.</li>
      <li>more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>This brush holds more lather</li>
      <li>But none of that detracts from the fact that it&#x27;s rapidly become one of my favorite</li>
      <li>Heres the best part though, because it is synthetic it will last longer and will not mold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this brush based solely upon the reviews of others, and I have to say I could not be more pleased.</li>
      <li>Creates lots of lather and it gives up the lather easily</li>
      <li>The lather went on smooth and easy every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>bristles themselves are fine.  </li>
      <li>The brush holds a lot of water and a lot of lather, but I&#x27;m less than impressed with face feel</li>
      <li>This brush does a better job than my pricey, name-brand super badger.  </li>
      <li>The tips are very soft, but the knot has good support to help with lathering, an engineering marvel.</li>
      <li>Experiencing how the synthetic brush has advanced to this level, from this point on I will not purchase animal hair shaving brushes.</li>
      <li>I will edit this if I have any future problems, but this seems to be a great value...</li>
      <li>The bristles&#x27; properties are not quite as good as my old badger brush</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an excellent value for a large shaving brush that does the job better than any other brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>but it is magnificent, there is plenty of backbone and the softness is unbelievable..</li>
      <li>It would in fact behave much more like the badger brush which most people would use as the gold standard against which it would be compared.brush and whip it into a foam with a bit more water in a separate bowl.</li>
      <li>Felt like trying a synthetic, especially would have loved it at this price.</li>
      <li>It does still have more backbone than most traditional badger brushes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that the handle is a bit larger than most and doesn&#x27;t fit into my brush stand the way it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>While this may seem like a good thing, when switching back and forth between this brush and my Rooney 3/3 silvertip and Simpsons Keyhole 4 in best, I found that I actually missed the (minimal) amount of scritch and scrub of those brushes.</li>
      <li>In fact you need to shake it lightly about 3 times or you could have too much water.</li>
      <li>It really is a great brush for everyday use.  </li>
      <li>You might just want to give this brush some consideration if you are looking for a nice synthetic brush in the mid price range.</li>
      <li>the swirls arent as nice as regular badgers though.</li>
      <li>It took a week of trial and error to figure out the right quantity of water and heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That has pluses and minuses which each user must determine for themselves if a synthetic is right for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The handle is better than expected for being plastic though it scratches easily</li>
      <li>I was able to negotiate the ears and quickly apply lather to the back of my head for the head shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it feels very similar to my Rooney 3/1 Super but with more backbone.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic shaving brush, and it performs just as well as friends&#x27; authentic badger brushed at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This holds water exceptionally well due to the density and quantity of fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Furthermore, you&#x27;re not scraping a caracas across your face every time you shave (which really makes no difference for you, but, I suspect, a tremendous difference for the badger).</li>
      <li>My favorite feature of this brush however, is how efficient it is, this thing only uses 1/4 to 1/2 of the normal amount of product to produce gobs of rich lather.</li>
      <li>When I saw this brush I thought that it would be similar to the Franks Synthetic (FS) that had enjoyed.</li>
      <li>Afterwards, I was able to squeeze the brush and get a larger wad of lather at the finger and thumb.</li>
      <li>At least, I was happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Practically no bloom after the first couple of uses</li>
      <li>this synthetic brush is really good for everyday use.</li>
      <li>I like that no animals were killed so I could get a good shave.</li>
      <li>Not to mention a good quality badger brush can be three times more expensive than this brush.</li>
      <li>first I did not like it and was ready to return it.  </li>
      <li>and then I should be all set for pretty much the rest of my life for brushes.</li>
      <li>Lathers well, cleans easily, doesn&#x27;t smell like a wet dog during break-in, inexpensive, dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a big brush but easy to grip and use.</li>
      <li>This brush was large compared to what I was used to using at 28 mm on the knot size.&lt;br</li>
      <li>kinda large for my tastes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also relatively large (although I understand it&#x27;s also available in smaller sizes).  </li>
      <li>The reason I enjoy larger brushes is because I like the sensation of being enveloped by the brush.</li>
      <li>- It is very efficient.</li>
      <li>I also really like that it is vegan.</li>
      <li>This shaving brush works great and it is replacing a couple of tired boar&#x27;s hair brushes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Ultimately I found the solution to be making sure I was using hot water to pre-heat the cup and use a touch of hot water to soften the soap and if it seems too watery, then simply squeeze out the brush back into the cup and whip it up some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I do not need to use a separate bowl to keep from picking up too much</li>
      <li>so much I would sooner swap out the stand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>- It is a real lather monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>No noticeable bristles have fallen out, and the whole brush has retained its condition as when I fist started using it.</li>
      <li>And that is really all I wanta brush to do.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t see any real compromise.  </li>
      <li>It whips up creams really fast.</li>
      <li>I think the density of the brush fibers is so high that it creates a very strong lather production due to the fibers moving against each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although I never thought that I&#x27;d use a synthetic other than when going on camping trips, I love this brush.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Comparing it to a boar, it isn&#x27;t the triple-milled soap destroyer like my Semogue brush, but because of its strong backbone, it&#x27;s much better at loading hard soaps than my soft badgers.</li>
      <li>Everything from the other positive reviews has been accurate for me.</li>
      <li>I noted that it had more of a whiteness at the where the FS had black tips.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is also important to start with a dry brush as it can hold a LOT of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s reluctance to fan particularly well.</li>
      <li>Work up a decent lather.</li>
      <li>I was able to remedy this by mashing the brush against my hand for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>I normally like brushes with knots in the 20-25 mm range.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> kinda large for my tastes but i do think its nicely made and it doesnt shed any hairs. dries quickly and give good painting strokes. the swirls arent as nice as regular badgers though.</li>
    <li> For a synthetic this is a very good quality brush. The flex is reasonably firm without being stiff and the bristles are soft, no \\&quot;prickles\\&quot; at all. It&#x27;s softened up quite a bit in the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it. It&#x27;s a big brush but easy to grip and use. It lathers well and holds the foam with both shaving cream and ordinary soap. The bristles&#x27; properties are not quite as good as my old badger brush but I never want to buy a badger brush again. During my research on shaving brushes I came across videos and other information on the horrific torture and extreme cruelty  these poor animals are subjected to in the hunting and slaughtering process. It&#x27;s just sickening; I don&#x27;t know how humans can be so brutal. So, I intend to never support this type of behaviour ever again. This brush fits the purpose perfectly.</li>
    <li> When I saw this brush I thought that it would be similar to the Franks Synthetic (FS) that had enjoyed. I noted that it had more of a whiteness at the where the FS had black tips. So I went on to order the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I received the brush and was surprised at the size. I normally like brushes with knots in the 20-25 mm range. This brush was large compared to what I was used to using at 28 mm on the knot size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed was that is looked more like a Silvertip Badger than the other synthetics. The brush is dense in fact it is much denser than any other brush I have. Now that I have this brush, it is time to see how it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got use to the size, I found this to be a very good brush in terms of application. I was able to negotiate the ears and quickly apply lather to the back of my head for the head shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here were some areas that I observed about the H.I.S. brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water retention: Does it hold water sufficiently enough?&lt;br /&gt;Yes - In fact you need to shake it lightly about 3 times or you could have too much water. This holds water exceptionally well due to the density and quantity of fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loading: Does it pick up soaps and creams easily?&lt;br /&gt;Yes - It is very efficient. A little soap or cream goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather: Does it built and apply lather well?&lt;br /&gt;Yes - It is a real lather monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it with Fitness Soap in a mug. It made enough lather for 4 1/2 thick face passes (2 of them I simply wiped off because I had finished face shaving). Then it made 2 full head shave passes with thick lather. Afterwards, I was able to squeeze the brush and get a larger wad of lather at the finger and thumb. This amount of lather was made with one dip into water with a three shake to reduce moisture and only 2 swirls to pick up the soap. No additional water or soap was used. I also used it with a nickel sized drop of C.O. Bigelow cream and got the same results.I think the density of the brush fibers is so high that it creates a very strong lather production due to the fibers moving against each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: Does it allow for a soft/smooth/effective application of lather to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Yes - The lather went on smooth and easy every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality feel: Does the synthetic brush have the \\&quot;quality\\&quot; feel against the skin?&lt;br /&gt;It has a soft quality feel against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance: Is the look of the brush attractive? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One additional thing about synthetics is that you can be a little more rough with them versus natural hairs and not have a problem with them. They will not bloom or change shape. In my experience I have found is, what you get with a synthetic is a uniform product that does not change over time. That has pluses and minuses which each user must determine for themselves if a synthetic is right for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, would I recommend this brush to others.&lt;br /&gt;Yes! In fact, I have ordered a backup brush because I like this one so well. You might just want to give this brush some consideration if you are looking for a nice synthetic brush in the mid price range.</li>
    <li> I am loving this brush. It lathers great, feels good in the hand and the best part not made from an animal. May buy another and then I should be all set for pretty much the rest of my life for brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush was nice.  At least, I was happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for one thing.  Hairs kept falling out.  All the time.  And they&#x27;d stick to my face, and the counter, and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 6 months, large chunks of brush starting coming out of the base.  This persisted for 4 months until the entire brush came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles themselves are fine.  I mean, I wanted a non-animal brush, and I was getting shaved, and really, I couldn&#x27;t don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about the brush when it was new.  It worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the company needs to hire someone that knows something about adhesives, because a brush that exposed to water should not use an adhesive that fails when water is applied.</li>
    <li> Although I never thought that I&#x27;d use a synthetic other than when going on camping trips, I love this brush.  It&#x27;s the softest brush that I own, even softer than silvertip.  It has great water retention, and produces huge quantities of very fine lather using a bowl with either soap or cream, which can then be painted onto the face for a luxurious shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although other reviewers have praised the backbone of the brush, I find it a bit too soft for face lathering.  It&#x27;s also relatively large (although I understand it&#x27;s also available in smaller sizes).  But none of that detracts from the fact that it&#x27;s rapidly become one of my favorite brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at the price, it&#x27;s the bargain of the year.</li>
    <li> I have used this brush regularly for the past four months, and have been supremely satisfied. No noticeable bristles have fallen out, and the whole brush has retained its condition as when I fist started using it. The hairs are firm, the handle is still shiny and solid. And it feels wonderful on my face, basically my favorite part of shaving. I haven&#x27;t used any other brushes, but I have nothing to want from this one. Everything from the other positive reviews has been accurate for me. I also really like that it is vegan. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the biggest shaving brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. I got it so that I could experience a brush made from synthetic materials. The brush holds a lot of water and a lot of lather, but I&#x27;m less than impressed with face feel and it&#x27;s reluctance to fan particularly well. I use it a lot when I face lather, since the brushes ability to hold lather makes it useful when I&#x27;m only building lather on my face. There are times when the brush feels so soft against the skin as to suggest the bristles have no backbone at all. It&#x27;s not a brush for those who like a little skritch from their brush.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shaving brush, and it performs just as well as friends&#x27; authentic badger brushed at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, you&#x27;re not scraping a caracas across your face every time you shave (which really makes no difference for you, but, I suspect, a tremendous difference for the badger).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about two months, and it is excellent.  I shave in the shower using a fog-free mirror.  This brush does a better job than my pricey, name-brand super badger.  I use a French soap and just a few swirls in the soap loads it up for several brush cycles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent value for a large shaving brush that does the job better than any other brush I&#x27;ve used. You will gloat every morning over this purchase and recommend it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I just got this to replace the brush that came with the Vander set (I purchased here)...It seems to be amazing...builds great lather and is way way better than the brush that came with the set I got from Amazon...I will edit this if I have any future problems, but this seems to be a great value...Plus no smell from animal hair and no animals harmed...great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day for 3 years now and would not even think of using anything else anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite tired of my sink clogging up with badger hair so I sought an alternative and found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I did not like it and was ready to return it.  The bristles are not hard enough to dig into a hard soap and it is so dense and holds so much water that I wound up with more soap/water inside the brush than on my face.  I was either not getting any lather or it was too watery.  It took a week of trial and error to figure out the right quantity of water and heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I found the solution to be making sure I was using hot water to pre-heat the cup and use a touch of hot water to soften the soap and if it seems too watery, then simply squeeze out the brush back into the cup and whip it up some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also important to start with a dry brush as it can hold a LOT of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried a softer soap (Taylor of old bond street) and it easily picks up enough soap from there without all that effort, but I went back to Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Unscented Soap, 3.5 Ounce as it is cheaper and I do not need to use a separate bowl to keep from picking up too much soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of foam in between all those bristles, so I generally squeeze out the soap off the brush between my fingers and thumb and pick up the soap with the brush from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I figured out a method that works, I am very happy with it.  No more bristles clogging up my drain.  After 3 years, I have not seen a single one come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if the people who made this are reading this review, I would suggest that they make a 2nd model where the bristles are a bit thicker and therefore stiffer to dig into hard soap which would also make it less dense in order to hold less water.  It would in fact behave much more like the badger brush which most people would use as the gold standard against which it would be compared.brush and whip it into a foam with a bit more water in a separate bowl.&gt;</li>
    <li> I will echo everyone&#x27;s praises about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -- It&#x27;s a terrific value at 1/4 of the cost of a badger&lt;br /&gt; -- Creates lots of lather and it gives up the lather easily&lt;br /&gt; -- Dries fast&lt;br /&gt; -- No funny smells like with new badgers or boars&lt;br /&gt; -- It hasn&#x27;t shed a single hair since I&#x27;ve owned it (2 months)&lt;br /&gt; -- Luxurious feel&lt;br /&gt; -- Nice weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the nitpicks I have about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -- The handle feels a little cheap compared to my other badger brushes (Simpsons, Rooney, Edwin Jagger)&lt;br /&gt; -- The brush tips are so soft that you barely feel them on your face&lt;br /&gt; -- The backbone of this brush is very strong and doesn&#x27;t splay out on the face without a bit of effort&lt;br /&gt; -- Practically no bloom after the first couple of uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an excellent value for a quality brush. I was so impressed with it that I ordered one for my brother in law. That said, the feeling of the brush is something that took me a while to get used to. It has feather soft tips with the backbone of a boar brush, so the feeling on the face can sometimes be vague. It takes a bit of effort to splay this brush on your face. The reason I enjoy larger brushes is because I like the sensation of being enveloped by the brush. I was able to remedy this by mashing the brush against my hand for a few minutes. This helped loosen it up and now it splays nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has no scritch. While this may seem like a good thing, when switching back and forth between this brush and my Rooney 3/3 silvertip and Simpsons Keyhole 4 in best, I found that I actually missed the (minimal) amount of scritch and scrub of those brushes. I think a bit of scritch helps exfoliate and prepare the skin for the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing it to a boar, it isn&#x27;t the triple-milled soap destroyer like my Semogue brush, but because of its strong backbone, it&#x27;s much better at loading hard soaps than my soft badgers. Because of itsultra soft tips, I prefer using this brush with creams. Face lathering can be a bit of a challenge until the backbone is tamed because of its smallish bloom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After owning this brush for a few months, it has moved slowly down to the bottom of my rotation. It seems that the novelty of this brush has worn off and I just don&#x27;t pick it up as often as my badger brushes. I still highly recommend it for someone that is on a tight budget or is concerned about using animal products.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaving brush for a little over a three months. It&#x27;s difficult to tell it&#x27;s not fine badger and that&#x27;s impressive.  I have lost no bristles so far. It lathers nicely and cleans up great. The handle is better than expected for being plastic though it scratches easily i have not had a problem with soap residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that the handle is a bit larger than most and doesn&#x27;t fit into my brush stand the way it&#x27;s supposed to. I like this brush so much I would sooner swap out the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush works great and it is replacing a couple of tired boar&#x27;s hair brushes.  The tips are very soft, but the knot has good support to help with lathering, an engineering marvel. It whips up creams really fast. This brush holds more lather my boar brushes together. Something peculiar is that physically this product is larger than any brush I have handled, and it seems extremely durable. It does not shed! Experiencing how the synthetic brush has advanced to this level, from this point on I will not purchase animal hair shaving brushes. Now I will have to seek out a smaller synthetic brush for travel also.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two years now. It has worked well for me. I like that no animals were killed so I could get a good shave.</li>
    <li> Bought this two years ago---use it as my daily shaving brush.  A great alternative to badger, and, in my opinion, just as good.  I have a very nice badger brush, but this one does everything it needs to and I can&#x27;t see any real compromise.  Lathers well, cleans easily, doesn&#x27;t smell like a wet dog during break-in, inexpensive, dries quickly.  It really is a great brush for everyday use.  I use it in the shower so it stays pretty wet, but shows no sign of wear or breakdown.  I use it, rinse it, shake off whatever water I can and then just leave it handle down.  A real shaving snob (and I mean that in a friendly way) may prefer real badger, but this synthetic brush is really good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush and as good as many that cost 3 times as much. This makes a great lather with any soap I choose to use. It&#x27;s good for bowl lathering or face lathering.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this brush based solely upon the reviews of others, and I have to say I could not be more pleased. The brush has broken in very nicely with very minimal shedding. I&#x27;ve only had maybe five of the fibers fall out in the three months I have owned it. It has a fairly stiff backbone when it is new; however, it loosens up a bit after some use. It does still have more backbone than most traditional badger brushes. I purchased this over a traditional badger brush because I didn&#x27;t want to kill a badger just to shave and I wasn&#x27;t very fond of the smell of traditional brushes. Not to mention a good quality badger brush can be three times more expensive than this brush. My brush was not quite as white as the one in the picture, not that I minded at all. The brush is much bigger than a standard badger, I really like the size of this brush. I am very satisfied with the amount of lather the brush produces as well. I only have to dip the tips of the brush in my Truefitt &amp; Hill and I have plenty of lather for at least two full passes. I went through my first container of Taylor of Old Bond Street faster than I needed to as I did not realize how little shaving cream I actually needed. So, a word of advice. Play the \\&quot;How little can I use\\&quot; game until you find out how much you actually need to shave. In doing this you will prolong the life of your shaving cream. Just a thought. If you are looking for an affordable, high quality brush without killing furry little creatures, then this brush is for you! I would not hesitate to make this purchase again.</li>
    <li> This thing blows badger brushes out of the water. It is a generation 4 synthetic so its has the same water retention, and softness of the highest grade badgers. Heres the best part though, because it is synthetic it will last longer and will not mold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a year since I bought this and it is still in great shape.</li>
    <li> Been through several brushes. Felt like trying a synthetic, especially would have loved it at this price. However, sortof a POS. Bristles too soft and long to work up a decent lather. And that is really all I wanta brush to do. Work up a decent lather. But it just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have only had this beauty for a couple of days but it is magnificent, there is plenty of backbone and the softness is unbelievable..it feels very similar to my Rooney 3/1 Super but with more backbone. My favorite feature of this brush however, is how efficient it is, this thing only uses 1/4 to 1/2 of the normal amount of product to produce gobs of rich lather. Example..Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat, I&#x27;ve never been a big fan because even after loading my brush for 1 minute I&#x27;d barely have enough lather for 3 passes (I do 4) and the 3rd pass was thin and watery, so MWF had been demoted to the back of my shaving cabinet. I brought it out first thing when I received this brush and with only THIRTY seconds of loading the H.I.S Brush produced enough THICK lather for my 4 passes and there was probably enough left in the brush for 2 more passes. It is still early but I am tempted to thin out and sell much of my brush herd in the future and order a couple more of these bad boys for backup!</li>
