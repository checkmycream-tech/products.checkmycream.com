      <li>A lot better than what I have been able to find in the store.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bronze fits in with most hair colors and seem invisible.  </li>
      <li>Am glad I purchased.</li>
      <li>Some of the color faded but thats okay</li>
      <li>Most come bareback.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>They are better than the ones I purchased from Dollar Tree.</li>
      <li>we use them for weddings and they hold so much better than anything you&#x27;ll ever find at a drugstore.</li>
      <li>I use these pins to curl my hair up on the top of my head at night so my curls stay in.  </li>
      <li>These are just OKAY.</li>
      <li>I should be able to reuse these the majority of the time.</li>
      <li>and I get more for my money.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These large/jumbo bobby pins are great for updos where you are trying to secure large pieces of hair.</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t that many products on the market as strong as they used to be.  </li>
      <li>These are good quality large bobby pins.  </li>
      <li>Because of how large they are they hold a good amount of hair.</li>
      <li>Compared to all the other drug and beauty supply places I&#x27;ve bought them, these are best.  </li>
      <li>I find the curved ones twist easily</li>
      <li>Bend easily out of shape.</li>
      <li>Great big strong bobby pins for thick/heavy hair.</li>
      <li>but I could not buy them locally anymore, so i was happy to see then on Amazon.</li>
      <li>For the money, if you use bobby pins, this is the most economical.  </li>
      <li>Hey,  they&#x27;re cheap in price and quality.</li>
      <li>Fantastic for holding lots of hair.</li>
      <li>really really cheap.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even need an elastic or hairspray to help keep it secure.  </li>
      <li>And it feels secure.  </li>
      <li>GREAT for people with long hair!</li>
      <li>I love how these pins are large and grabs all of my hair.</li>
      <li>they are straight which seems to work better for me.  </li>
      <li>In this case, the &amp;#34;better quality&amp;#34; was not a selling point for me as I could only use the pins one time before they were bent out of shape for good.</li>
      <li>I received my product very quickly and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend smaller pins for details in hairstyles, but these are great for things like large buns</li>
      <li>Great pins to do a hair dubbie and other hair styles.</li>
      <li>good, long, and well packaged.</li>
      <li>exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>Perfect for thick hair!</li>
      <li>They are a light brown/bronze color that matches my auburn hair really well.</li>
      <li>Does the job and does it right.</li>
      <li>For the first time this summer I have been able to get my hair off my neck completely.  </li>
      <li>These really do the job!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s plenty of them to hold my hair on top of my head, &amp; plenty left over in case I lose or misplace some of them too.</li>
      <li>Great for people who have a lot of hair or really thick hair.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>but this was the exact type of bobby pins i was looking for.</li>
      <li>Good price for a nice standard product that is hard to find where I live.</li>
      <li>The grip is strong and remains so after multiple uses, and the rubber nubbies at the ends don&#x27;t come off.</li>
      <li>These are great for holding up thick hair!</li>
      <li>I was hoping these would be a little more blonde, but they&#x27;re more of the brunette color.</li>
      <li>Like them and the color very much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but since i am using them for my rollers it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
      <li>so I am posting a picture to show how much scaled up in size these pins are.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t need to use more than 2!</li>
      <li>I will use the 2&amp;#34; for most updo styles, but there are times when you need a slightly longer pin.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buying more in the future.  </li>
      <li>But if you were using them for their intended purpose, I think you might actually like these better than traditional hair pins.</li>
      <li>They tend to rust pretty quickly if left wet, but there are so many in the pack I have just been tossing the ones that develop rust.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I have watched many hair tutorials and learned how to add texture with various styling products but was still using 30 - 40 traditional size (and even professional quality) pins and even after much practice it still took me 10 - 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>The pin head does not break easily unless other pins I had purchased.</li>
      <li>If you want heavy duty, though, this is for you, but if you like being able to bend your hairpins, then maybe don&#x27;t get these.</li>
      <li>This is my 2nd purchase after about a year of my first tub.</li>
      <li>These big bobby pins are great for long, thick hair like mine.</li>
      <li>I had some pins this size from my wedding hair that can hold so much hair without bending open and I was hoping these would replace those, but they do open/ bend out of shape.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair and it holds my hair in place nice enough.</li>
      <li>I love the size because my hair is so thick.</li>
      <li>The two hold my hair in really well all day long.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have nothing negative to say about this. Does the job and does it right. Everything you would expect. Am glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> Great big strong bobby pins for thick/heavy hair. I&#x27;d recommend smaller pins for details in hairstyles, but these are great for things like large buns - just two pins will hold up my waist-length hair all day. The grip is strong and remains so after multiple uses, and the rubber nubbies at the ends don&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> With heavy blond hair I&#x27;ve used these bobby pins for years.  I was delighted to find the bronze heavy pins online; however these pins are very poor quality .  The covering on the tips are pulling away from the metal leaving little gaps where my hair gets pulled .  Also several pins were stuck together.  Some were also stuck with little globs between the 2 prongs causing the pins to stick and not open without being pried open.  Even then the residue left on the prongs gets caught in my hair.  Still, I savaged enough to replenish my dwindling supply since I only use 8 or 10 pins total to set my hair.</li>
    <li> Giant bobby pins that help keep hair out of face. Great for people who have a lot of hair or really thick hair. Would not recommend for someone with medium to thin hair since they are so large. Loved that they came in the container so they are easily stored away.</li>
    <li> I love the size because my hair is so thick. I can do all kinds of styles with them and they stay in place. They are better than the ones I purchased from Dollar Tree.</li>
    <li> Great bobby pins- we use them for weddings and they hold so much better than anything you&#x27;ll ever find at a drugstore.</li>
    <li> Great bobby pins! These are great for holding up thick hair!</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for! Perfect for thick hair!</li>
    <li> I received my product very quickly and it was exactly what I wanted. Also the price was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to do. I have thick hair and it holds my hair in place nice enough. No complaints!!!!!</li>
    <li> i use and lose these pins all the time.  they are straight which seems to work better for me.  I find the curved ones twist easily</li>
    <li> These are just OKAY. They get the job done, but if they bend out of shape at all, you&#x27;ll never get them back the way they were. If you want heavy duty, though, this is for you, but if you like being able to bend your hairpins, then maybe don&#x27;t get these. In this case, the &amp;#34;better quality&amp;#34; was not a selling point for me as I could only use the pins one time before they were bent out of shape for good. But if you were using them for their intended purpose, I think you might actually like these better than traditional hair pins.</li>
    <li> These are amazing. They keep my hair in place and you get a TON for the price. This is my 2nd purchase after about a year of my first tub.</li>
    <li> Bend easily out of shape. Don&#x27;t grip to hair so they slip out.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these would be a little more blonde, but they&#x27;re more of the brunette color. I had some pins this size from my wedding hair that can hold so much hair without bending open and I was hoping these would replace those, but they do open/ bend out of shape. What they lack in durability for keeping the closed shape they make up in quantity, so although I&#x27;m tossing some with my super heavy hair, there are plenty in the pack for the price.</li>
    <li> My thick wavy hair doesn&#x27;t spit these out despite being straight pins.  They are HEAVY DUTY MAN.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a miracle.</li>
    <li> These pins do what they&#x27;re supposed to do!  Highly recommend.  I&#x27;m throwing all my Walmart ones away.  These hold my fine hair perfectly!  I will use the 2&amp;#34; for most updo styles, but there are times when you need a slightly longer pin.</li>
    <li> I have really thick and long hair, so trying to put it in a bun is impossible.  That is until these beauties came in today.  For the first time this summer I have been able to get my hair off my neck completely.  And it feels secure.  I wish I had these bobby pins when I was kid doing ballet, I would have wasted less bobby pins.  (I remember a recital where a few came out on stage).  I don&#x27;t even need an elastic or hairspray to help keep it secure.  I will definitely buying more in the future.  They cost less than Scunci, the brand I usually get and I get more for my money.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, they keep falling out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for holding lots of hair. I have long hair--most of the way down my back, though it is fine--and I use these to keep it all up in a bun. I usually don&#x27;t need to use more than 2!</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t that many products on the market as strong as they used to be.  However, I&#x27;ll order these again because it&#x27;s a good buy.  When they stretch out, I just throw them out.</li>
    <li> I have dirty blonde hair similar to Heidi Klum or Hayden Panattierre and the pins are a little bit darker, but they work fine- especially because I usually use them underneath my hair around the nape of my neck where my hair is a little darker. Good length. Good quality.</li>
    <li> For the money, if you use bobby pins, this is the most economical.  Compared to all the other drug and beauty supply places I&#x27;ve bought them, these are best.  The only reason I withheld one star, is that the round container they came in, cracked within the first week.  BFD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sequim, WA</li>
    <li> really really cheap. These are not the jumbo bobby pins you remember from a few years ago. Very thin mettle with some coating which is flaking off.</li>
    <li> Tips are not covered. Nice product and packaging otherwise.</li>
    <li> Ever use a bobby pin and the little nubby has fallen off? Remember how it dug into your scalp? You dont have to wait for the nubby to fall off these. Most come bareback. The rest have the smallest nub possible. Hey,  they&#x27;re cheap in price and quality.</li>
    <li> These are ideal for holding on wigs or updos.  Like them and the color very much.&lt;br /&gt;Bronze fits in with most hair colors and seem invisible.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with these pins.&lt;br /&gt;Ideal for hairdressers and lay people alike.</li>
    <li> I got these and they were open and all over the box they came in.  So I was missing a few pins and that is why I only gave them 4 stars.  I use these pins to curl my hair up on the top of my head at night so my curls stay in.  I also use two of them to pin my hair into a french twist.  The two hold my hair in really well all day long.  These are favorites but I could not buy them locally anymore, so i was happy to see then on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to hold up my long thick hair in a bun for church! Works great!</li>
    <li> If you need pins to hold a lot of hair, this is the pin. It&#x27;s great at holding without coming out...BUT...most of the time, I only get one use out of the pin because the plastic cushion comes off when I remove the pins. I know these are a good price, but that part about them is not made well at all. I should be able to reuse these the majority of the time. Sometimes I can put it back on, but its just going to happen again. Who has time for that?  So, just beware of that.</li>
    <li> Purchasing these size Bobby Pins is very expensive.  You usually may get 20 for around 4 bucks.  These are the size I need for putting in my rollers.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I recommend this product.  I thank you, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am constantly leaving a trail of bobby pins wherever I go, so I need to replace them semi-regularly. I was so happy to find large, high-quantity tubs of good-quality bobby pins on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These large/jumbo bobby pins are great for updos where you are trying to secure large pieces of hair. If you are just looking to pin back bangs or a few strands, these might be too heavy-duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 100 bobby pins for a lower price than I would have paid for 10-20 at a local store. They are a light brown/bronze color that matches my auburn hair really well. If your hair is very dark or light, consider going with a different color.</li>
    <li> I love thses bobby pins, Great prise, and sturdy material. Some of the color faded but thats okay its not much. I usually paint the tops of them with nail polish so I dont care. I would definatly recommend</li>
    <li> Is a great product the pins are made of a strong material so you can easli  use them more then one time!!</li>
    <li> These big bobby pins are great for long, thick hair like mine. A good choice as an add-on item for shipping.</li>
    <li> The price was right but the bobby pins are badly made. The ends of the pins pinch and pull your hair. threw them all out.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have really long and thick hair so bobby pins can never hold my hair up. These pins work great and do their job all day. Great product and great price. Even purchased some for my mom who always thought they were great.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what i was looking for. the only other place i could find them was in New York! but this was the exact type of bobby pins i was looking for. The only thing i would change would be the color. but since i am using them for my rollers it doesn&#x27;t really matter. but if you have black hair, i recommend you get black bobby pins as these are bronze.</li>
    <li> A lot better than what I have been able to find in the store. They tend to rust pretty quickly if left wet, but there are so many in the pack I have just been tossing the ones that develop rust.</li>
    <li> They are bobby pins, they are big, they work.</li>
    <li> Great pins to do a hair dubbie and other hair styles. The pin head does not break easily unless other pins I had purchased.</li>
    <li> The protective coat on tip of pins were not secure as a result they snag on hair. I&#x27;ve bought the same brand from a beauty supply shop and never encountered this problem. I think this bunch were all the ones that are defective.</li>
    <li> I love how these pins are large and grabs all of my hair. Does not snag or pull out my hair. The color of the pins are great as well.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for our granddaugher, who is a jazz dancer.  She goes through lots of Bobby Pins, so when I found this I just had to get them for her. I know that they should last her for a little while.</li>
    <li> good, long, and well packaged.</li>
    <li> not quite as nice as thes ones in the store, but for the price they&#x27;re ok.</li>
    <li> Can a Bobby pin change your life? Maybe so. I have hair that is difficult to pin up - it is very long and thick but also very fine. I have watched many hair tutorials and learned how to add texture with various styling products but was still using 30 - 40 traditional size (and even professional quality) pins and even after much practice it still took me 10 - 15 minutes. I wear it up almost every day in various messy updos and buns / twists and now that I have these pins I am down to 6-8 pins and less than 5 minutes styling time. When I was considering buying them I was too lazy to measure my regular pins so I am posting a picture to show how much scaled up in size these pins are.</li>
    <li> These are good quality large bobby pins.  I have used them multiple times and have not yet had one bend beyond being usable.  The tips have stayed on, and the bobby pins haven&#x27;t torn any hair.</li>
    <li> this was a great deal, will never have to look for pins again when doing my hair up or just getting it out of my face...love these..the perfect color tone for my hair...</li>
    <li> I love this. I used it to make my 3/4 wig and it fits perfectly on my hair. I made a YouTube video please check it out youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;-efDR5dBics  you will see how the wig looks like.</li>
    <li> I have extremely long, heavy, curly, frizzy hair. Most bobby pins &amp; hair clamps are too wimpy for my thick, crazy hair. These really do the job! There&#x27;s plenty of them to hold my hair on top of my head, &amp; plenty left over in case I lose or misplace some of them too.</li>
    <li> Good price for a nice standard product that is hard to find where I live.</li>
    <li> GREAT for people with long hair!</li>
    <li> Just perfect for my needs!  Quality made as well.</li>
    <li> This was what I was looking for. I still am not great at doing my hair but these bobby pins have really helped. They came within the time given and were packaged well.</li>
    <li> I have zero complaints about the price, the quantity, the speed of shipping, the quality or anything else. I am very happy with this product, EXCEPT, it says it is bronze but it is brown so if you are looking for these to blend in with your blonde hair, it won&#x27;t work. My daughter has blonde hair but it is a darker blonde and these still stick out as being obviously brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I am very happy.</li>
    <li> very light and great price</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are amazing! Because of how large they are they hold a good amount of hair. These pins are extremely well made as far as the structure, but the only downfall is the color on the bobby pins flake off.</li>
