      <li>Absolutely love this product</li>
      <li>My favorite bath and body works product.  </li>
      <li>It has the scent of the woods and something else, something exotic, and seductive.</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for years now - it came closest to replacing my favorite, which they discontinued...</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and silky feel on my skin.</li>
      <li>What more can I say than this is my favorite scent in lotion.</li>
      <li>I received a Twilight Woods gift set awhile ago on Christmas, and I quickly fell in love with the scent!</li>
      <li>Distinctive scent but not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t use a huge amount.</li>
      <li>She is so happy with her present.</li>
      <li>I was bummed when this scent was no longer available in stores.</li>
      <li>it has a very nice smell which the smell will last on your skin</li>

      <li>It is very strong so you only need about the size of a pea otherwise</li>
      <li>When using this,only put on a pea size amount or it will be to strong and wont have a natural smell.</li>
      <li>If nothing else, try it as a Tuesday and Thursday lotion, it&#x27;s scent is so unique that it can be a nice break from your usual lotion or just a nice scent if you&#x27;d like to wear something different a couple of days a week.</li>
      <li>This and Midnight Pomegranate are my current favorite fragrances.</li>
      <li>It really stays.</li>
      <li>Very well received.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much</li>
      <li>The scent is so original it could actually work just as well for a man to put on his face after shaving as it could for a woman to put on her hands or feet.</li>
      <li>Dark Kiss is my favorite</li>
      <li>Lasting power of this is great and and a little goes a long way with smell.</li>
      <li>It only takes a little. :)</li>
      <li>But you have to be careful because if you get to much it, it will be very overpowering and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just enough but not too much.</li>
      <li>I can smell this in the next room, behind closed doors, due to the whole house AC when my wonderful wife applies it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was really liquid-y for about a week, then I got the wild idea to stick it in the fridge and it thickened up back to a proper lotion consistency.</li>
      <li>In won major brownie points by buying this for my lady.  </li>
      <li>If you have exceedingly dry skin, try this lotion on the area for a week and see if it doesn&#x27;t clear up completely!</li>
      <li>I heard so much about this scent that I expected to be blown away</li>

    <li> Luxurious and fragrant I love the fragrance and silky feel on my skin.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and my friend loved it</li>
    <li> My favorite bath and body works product.  Distinctive scent but not too strong.  I wear this to work everyday.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious! perfect thank you!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my mom and she loved it! Before I made the purchase I searched the top Bath and Body Work lotions and this was one of the best!</li>
    <li> Smells so clean and fresh without smellinglike laundry or flowers or elderly women. Love it</li>
    <li> When using this,only put on a pea size amount or it will be to strong and wont have a natural smell. That is what I reccomend anyway.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same bottle in the picture</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and it smells great. It is very Dark and mysterious smelling. Which i like. But you have to be careful because if you get to much it, it will be very overpowering and ughhh not good. It is very strong so you only need about the size of a pea otherwise you will smell very very very strong.</li>
    <li> An exotic scent entices through the woods and so does this lotion. The scent is so original it could actually work just as well for a man to put on his face after shaving as it could for a woman to put on her hands or feet. It&#x27;s wonderful on the arms, face, and body as well. It has a slightly strong scent but that is part of the attraction because it&#x27;s not overbearing but more like enchanting and wonderful. It has the scent of the woods and something else, something exotic, and seductive. It&#x27;s a great product though for many reasons. It will soften the skin after shaving and reduce dryness anywhere it is applied. If you have exceedingly dry skin, try this lotion on the area for a week and see if it doesn&#x27;t clear up completely! Bath and Body works has always made such wonderful lotions and I recommend this one. If nothing else, try it as a Tuesday and Thursday lotion, it&#x27;s scent is so unique that it can be a nice break from your usual lotion or just a nice scent if you&#x27;d like to wear something different a couple of days a week.</li>
    <li> Mother&#x27;s Christmas present was well received. She loves any Bath &amp; Body stuff. Very well received. She says &amp;#34;You can get me anything like this, anytime you want&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> liked this lotion it has a very nice smell which the smell will last on your skin would recommend this product</li>
    <li> was for my girlfriend as a gift, the product let her body with full arome and she love it’s essence as well as I</li>
    <li> I love the warm, woodsy smell of this. I get compliments every time I wear it. Absolutely love this product</li>
    <li> The lotion smells great and was packaged almost in some kind of gift wrap. It arrived quickly and on time. The only complaint I have is that the lotion&#x27;s consistency was almost milky when I got it. Being in Arizona, the summer heat probably had something to do with the thinning factor. It was really liquid-y for about a week, then I got the wild idea to stick it in the fridge and it thickened up back to a proper lotion consistency. Make sure to consider weather effects on these kinds of products!</li>
    <li> Very good Lotion it Leaves you skin very nice I Love The Smell and the shipping doesn&#x27;t last so Long</li>
    <li> Dark Kiss is my favorite but this is a close second.  This is a wonderful product and has met my expectations.</li>

    <li> Have been using this product for years now - it came closest to replacing my favorite, which they discontinued... Smells great. I don&#x27;t even want to wash my shirts after I wear them, as it makes them smell great and I feel bad about discarding them.</li>

    <li> Delicious, delicious.  Love this smell</li>
