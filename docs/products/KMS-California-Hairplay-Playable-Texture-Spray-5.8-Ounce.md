      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I was so glad to see that Amazon carried this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and he said I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find any online,</li>
      <li>Great product for short baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great for getting unruly hair to behave especially when heat styling.</li>
      <li>This is not like the original hair play and therefore it does not work near as good.</li>
      <li>Works great for my somewhat thick, fine hair!</li>
      <li>I do like it, but I think I&#x27;m trying to combine it with too many other products, the waxy kind, Argan oil, etc.</li>
      <li>for me, with fine, med texture hair living in Minnesota, this just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
      <li>The playable texture is great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of hold</li>
      <li>great for messy hair day looks or used for manageability!</li>
      <li>Keeps my naturally curly hair nice and smooth after I flat iron it.</li>
      <li>it is much cheaper buying from Amazon than my Hair Stylist!</li>
      <li>Amazing for my soft short hair that lacks texture!</li>
      <li>You can use it as a styler, hairspray, or to add volume .Wet or dry hair, it has so many uses.</li>
      <li>This just didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
      <li>Great product if you have thin hair.  </li>
      <li>Gives the hair defined texture just be sure not to put too much otherwise it will weigh down your hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you have straight hair like mine.  </li>
      <li>My hairdresser used this on my hair and he loved it, said that you scarcely feel it in your hair, use it wet or dry, etc.</li>
      <li>I have a short, tousley do, the kind of messy sort of look</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product when I was in CA and recently ordered it because I cannot find it in PA-great product,you don&#x27;t have to use hair spray-YEA!!!!!</li>
      <li>Might work on other hair, but I love it for my short hair.</li>
      <li>I have an a line style haircut, and I wanted a product that would be light, give my layers some definition, add a little volume, and help maintain my style all day.</li>
      <li>Not only that, but the elements play such a huge part in how hair reacts - humidity, barrametic pressure, dry, raining etc.so</li>
      <li>I can spray on and do some really LIGHT teasing and it requires no more than fixing it with my hands!</li>

<li> /&gt;It is not sticky or stiff, but holds like nobody&#x27;s business.  </li>
<li> is just a few days, as usual.</li>
<li> I have a long pixie and my hair is thin.  </li>
<li> But I find that it&#x27;s difficult to review hair products constructively because everyones hair and texture and volume is so different.</li>
<li> I think I just need to leave the others out, or at least the waxy stuff.</li>
<li> Awful... made my hair so incredibly dry</li>

    <li> Great product.  I highly recommend if you have straight hair like mine.  It helps give it body, flexibility and all that good stuff I don&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Keeps my hair in place all day long.  Definitely buying this again.</li>
    <li> This just didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. But I find that it&#x27;s difficult to review hair products constructively because everyones hair and texture and volume is so different. Not only that, but the elements play such a huge part in how hair reacts - humidity, barrametic pressure, dry, raining etc.so for me, with fine, med texture hair living in Minnesota, this just didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair and he loved it, said that you scarcely feel it in your hair, use it wet or dry, etc. He also said he couldn&#x27;t keep it on the shelf and he was out then....and he said I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find any online, might as well not try. Hah! He doesn&#x27;t know my tenancity when challenged! I found it on Amazon and bought the sellers last two cans! (for likely way less than his salon sells it for, of course). I do like it, but I think I&#x27;m trying to combine it with too many other products, the waxy kind, Argan oil, etc. because my hair does feel a little gunky. I have a short, tousley do, the kind of messy sort of look and even I don&#x27;t want to run my hands thru my hair. I think I just need to leave the others out, or at least the waxy stuff. Of course, with Amazon, it got here is just a few days, as usual. Love that service!</li>
    <li> Great product! Holds without weighing hair down!</li>
    <li> Gives hair that great lift you need even in humid weather.</li>
    <li> Keeps my naturally curly hair nice and smooth after I flat iron it. This is the only product that actually keeps the humidity from ruining my hair style. You don&#x27;t even feel any product in your hair. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> great for messy hair day looks or used for manageability!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever tried that helps you style, stays shiny and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;It is not sticky or stiff, but holds like nobody&#x27;s business.  i&#x27;m so happy to have this.</li>
    <li> Gives the hair defined texture just be sure not to put too much otherwise it will weigh down your hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and soft and won&#x27;t stay teased or even in a clip. This product makes a huge difference!  Will definitely purchase it again.</li>

    <li> I have an a line style haircut, and I wanted a product that would be light, give my layers some definition, add a little volume, and help maintain my style all day. KMS playable texture is perfect! There&#x27;s no &amp;#34;product buildup&amp;#34; feeling in my hair at all either. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was so glad to see that Amazon carried this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the best products for those of us with fine hair. No need for hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it is much cheaper buying from Amazon than my Hair Stylist!</li>
    <li> Perfect lift &amp; texture</li>
    <li> Love this product! You can use it as a styler, hairspray, or to add volume .Wet or dry hair, it has so many uses. Added plus is that it also adds a shine to your hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for getting unruly hair to behave especially when heat styling. The only demerit I have is that you should definitely spray in a well ventilated area - it can get intense if you get a little carried away!</li>

    <li> Awful... made my hair so incredibly dry and I couldn&#x27;t even get my fingers through my hair.  I have a long pixie and my hair is thin.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning this to the salon i purchased it from.  Living Proof AMP is the way to go!</li>
    <li> Works great for my somewhat thick, fine hair!</li>

    <li> Good product.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Great product if you have thin hair.  Other waxes are too heavy.</li>
    <li> Great product for short baby fine hair. Might work on other hair, but I love it for my short hair. Does&#x27;t look gummy or &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; ... leaves my hair shiny but held in place.</li>
