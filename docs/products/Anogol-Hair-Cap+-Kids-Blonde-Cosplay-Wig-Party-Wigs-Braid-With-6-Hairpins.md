      <li>You will be glad you did.</li>

      <li>So much better than the ones you get at the toy store.</li>
      <li>I should have known the price was to good, you really do get what you pay for!</li>
      <li>Just like Elsa &amp; very full.</li>
      <li>I wanted to manipulate it a bit to look more accurate to the movie, but the hair sticks up</li>
      <li>Very soft and nice quality!</li>
      <li>I am overall happy with it though.</li>

      <li>Made my daughter&#x27;s dreams come true.  </li>
      <li>but once I fixed it and manged to get all my hair in it looked really nice with my costume.</li>
      <li>This looks gorgeous, but look is the key word.</li>
      <li>The wig is full of hair unlike the ones you buy from the toystore where you see bald spots.  </li>
      <li>Became ratty-looking quickly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended :)</li>
      <li>Pay a little more and find a better wig!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars because the top of the wig isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; and layered as the picture shows, and mine came with a strand of the braid pulled out, which I can easily re-braid myself, but I&#x27;d have preferred not to.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced, quick delivery!</li>
      <li>my 5 year old loves it!!!!!</li>
      <li>Fits my little 4 year old and she&#x27;s over the moon happy wearing it :)</li>
      <li>Very good quality but runs very small.  </li>

      <li>Nice and long like she wanted.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect color and the wig is soft and thick.</li>
      <li>Very fast service from seller.</li>
      <li>Service was very fast.</li>
      <li>a good color, but a little more yellow than in the picture.</li>
      <li>Thanks Anangel hair!</li>
      <li>My daughter wanted this for an Elsa costume, and it didn&#x27;t even fit her 9 year old head.</li>
      <li>Exact color match.</li>
      <li>Fit my 6 year old.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment!</li>
      <li>Specifically asked if this would fit an adult sized head</li>
      <li>I will definitely come back and purchase more for my daughter :)</li>
      <li>This wig will not show your hair underneath and is exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to cover well.</li>
      <li>Truthfully, better than I expected.  </li>
      <li>fast shipping received in a wk.</li>
      <li>But minor problem that can easily be dealt with.</li>
      <li>The wig is exactly how you see it in the picture, Both my four year old</li>
      <li>I had to brush it out a bit because it was pretty wildly</li>
      <li>None of the adults could fit it on their heads, only a 5 year old girl could wear it.</li>
      <li>We had to work and work to get it to stay on and look decent, and it never did.</li>
      <li>I could not believe the high quality of this wig.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 22 yr old, average sized female and this wig did fit my head comfortably.</li>
      <li>I had trouble fitting all my hair in</li>
      <li>The hair seems sturdy except for the lock/tie near her chin, keeps popping out!</li>

    <li> Perfect for adults but need to make smaller kid sizes still great though</li>
    <li> Really nice wig, fit my 7 year old perfectly for Halloween.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! Most kids gave her compliment. The hair seems sturdy except for the lock/tie near her chin, keeps popping out!</li>
    <li> Great with the Elsa costumes I made.  Very fast service from seller.</li>
    <li> Way too small for any adult.  I bought for a Halloween Event at my YMCA.  None of the adults could fit it on their heads, only a 5 year old girl could wear it.</li>
    <li> I should have known the price was to good, you really do get what you pay for! Terrible quality wig that sheds at the slightest touch. I ended up having to go to a local costume store and pay $35 for a wig.</li>
    <li> O.k. wig...just not big enough to cover all the hair.  Decided not to use.</li>
    <li> Specifically asked if this would fit an adult sized head and I was told yes. It came today and it wouldn&#x27;t even go over the entirety of my head thus clearly not covering everything. Terrible product. Took 2-3 weeks to get it, too. Aka longer than I had hoped.</li>
    <li> The wig was awesome.  Truthfully, better than I expected.  My granddaughter loves it!.  She just turned 6 and the wig generously covers all her hair!  Got the biggest smile ever!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My Grand daughter will be thrilled with this wig.  I read reviews of others that sell the Elsa (Frozen) wig. Many said the wig hair was sparse. This wig will not show your hair underneath and is exactly as advertised. Service was very fast. Very pleased</li>
    <li> This looks gorgeous, but look is the key word. No matter how hard I try, I can&#x27;t get this to fit correctly. You see hair showing no matter what. The wig is very stiff and untrainable. I wanted to manipulate it a bit to look more accurate to the movie, but the hair sticks up regardless.&lt;br /&gt;Its a good color, but a little more yellow than in the picture.</li>
    <li> Warning does NOT fit adult head!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 22 yr old, average sized female and this wig did fit my head comfortably. I received it 32 days ahead of schedule, which is great. It&#x27;s the perfect color and the wig is soft and thick. I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars because the top of the wig isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; and layered as the picture shows, and mine came with a strand of the braid pulled out, which I can easily re-braid myself, but I&#x27;d have preferred not to. It definitely looks like a wig at the hairline, also, which i something I try to avoid in a wig. Otherwise, a good product for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> The product is as advertised. Beautiful color, braided. Bought as a gift for 8th old for play costume. She loves to wear it.</li>
    <li> perfect size and really nice quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful!! It looks like something an adult could wear the quality is that good!!!!# my 5 year old loves it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Well made, and the hair color is perfect, the quality of the hair is very good, no open gaps, looks just like Elsa&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my newly 3 year old to wear as ELSA  for Halloween this year. I like the shade of blonde, but the wig is too large for her head.... I  will have to do lots of pinning to keep it on. I am overall happy with it though.</li>
    <li> Great wig! Just like Elsa &amp; very full. Fits my little 4 year old and she&#x27;s over the moon happy wearing it :) fast shipping received in a wk. Better than the Disney wig, perfect color and good quality. Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> Just ok- it was bigger than expected and not easy to work with.</li>
    <li> This is a great wig!  My daughter got so many compliments on it, everyone got a kick out of it! Very nice quality and great price.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter absolutely loved this.</li>
    <li> Would not stay on my niece&#x27;s head. Hair came out, would not recommend</li>
    <li> Not a pretty wig and missing hair in the middle and takes to long for shipping ! 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> Not good quality.&lt;br /&gt;6yr old ended up not wearing this with her costume.</li>
    <li> Great Anna wig that fits both adults and children as it has an adjustable strap.</li>
    <li> The wig is exactly how you see it in the picture, Both my four year old and I loved the way it looked, except for the size of wig. It doesn&#x27;t really seem to cover well. But minor problem that can easily be dealt with.</li>
    <li> Exact color match. Arrived in good condition. The package arrived early. All in all, a great experience.</li>
    <li> Fit my 6 year old. Nice and long like she wanted. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Became ratty-looking quickly.</li>
    <li> Small for an adult head.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this wig!  Looks just like Elsa&#x27;s hair in the movie.  Very good quality but runs very small.  Fits a 9 year old girl.</li>
    <li> This fits my 5 year old perfectly and it came in very good condition.  I like that it&#x27;s adjustable too.  I wish it fit me so I could dress up as Elsa for Halloween!</li>
    <li> This wig only cover 2/3 of my childs head.  It does not work! such a disappointment on Christmas morning.</li>
    <li> Terrible wig - poufy and horribly difficult to fit. My daughter wanted this for an Elsa costume, and it didn&#x27;t even fit her 9 year old head. We had to work and work to get it to stay on and look decent, and it never did. We threw it out after Halloween. Pay a little more and find a better wig!</li>
    <li> Great quality Frozen Elsa wig! I got it for my 4-year old and she loves it.  The wig is full of hair unlike the ones you buy from the toystore where you see bald spots.  I love that this wig is adjustable.  I just had to tighten the wig a little bit and it fits perfectly on my daughter.  Fast shipment! It came in 2 weeks after I placed the order online.  You get a great value for the price you pay unlike the wigs you can buy from the toystore.  I will definitely come back and purchase more for my daughter :) Thanks Anangel hair! Your product is awesome!</li>
    <li> Size for a 6-7 year old. But great for the price</li>
    <li> Awesome Elsa wig.  Product as described, great fit, great price.  Made my daughter&#x27;s dreams come true.  A must buy! You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I think this was a good Elsa wig. It was small so beware if you have a lot of hair. I had trouble fitting all my hair in and I have hair to my shoulders. I had to brush it out a bit because it was pretty wildly but once I fixed it and manged to get all my hair in it looked really nice with my costume.</li>
    <li> Loved this wig. Actually got it for my 5 yr old. So much better than the ones you get at the toy store. Would definitely buy from them again! Reasonably priced, quick delivery! Perfect!</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this wig got great reviews. It didn&#x27;t sit well and the strands were not sitting the way they should. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This was amazingly nice for the money, and suitable for a smaller child as well.</li>
    <li> So cute! Long hair lifelike with ability to make grand daughter pretend to be Elsa! Good quality.</li>
    <li> Way too big for little girls.</li>
    <li> Great. The hair cap is a nice plus when you are going to wear a wig.</li>
    <li> I could not believe the high quality of this wig. It is a gift for my granddaughter to complete her Elsa costume and I think she is going to love it. It arrived several weeks early, just in time for her birthday.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  Our granddaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> My six year old daughter wore this for Halloween with her Elsa dress and we received so many compliments on her wig! Very soft and nice quality!</li>
    <li> My daughter is so happy. Good wig</li>
