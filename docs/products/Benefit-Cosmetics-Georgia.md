### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
      <li>My go to blush is Benefit Dandelion, which looks perfect on me, but this color just doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This works perfectly with Benefit&#x27;s Hoola which I use for contouring.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin &amp; blush can look clownish on me.</li>
      <li>I started using it because I was told it was great for getting rid of redness in your skin.</li>
      <li>This product is great.  </li>
      <li>A person would have to practically be albino for it to show up as a blush--but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Georga has a very light feel, wonderful texture and is ALMOST weightless on my skin.  </li>
      <li>But the color is beautiful, and does smell really nice.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and love this powder.</li>
      <li>I just dust it on in the morning and another around midday and my complexion looking good</li>
      <li>I love the peachy smell of this too!</li>
      <li>I love this face powder!</li>
      <li>In addition I get a nice healthy glow!</li>
      <li>However, the consistency of the product is great--it goes on smoothly and evenly, lasts for a while, and smells great.</li>
      <li>I have warm medium skin, and this blush does not show up.</li>
      <li>First off, I am a very fair skinned girl.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly leaving a natural look &amp; the brush makes it a breeze &amp; saves time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light and refreshing!</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Its famous peaches?</li>
      <li>This lovely powder is better than blush...</li>
      <li>If you look better in Dandelion, then buy Dandelion.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I get compliments on how \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; I look, even after dehydration and consecutive nights of sleep deprivation. :)</li>
      <li>My entire family is fair skinned and fair haired Russians, Scandinavians, and Welsh people.</li>
      <li>and it gives me a nice, healthy looking glow that&#x27;s not too dark or peachy for my very fair skin.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair skin with a lot of red in it.  </li>
      <li>I know that this review sounds over the top, but honestly, this stuff really works for me.</li>
      <li>It looked so light</li>
      <li>I thought it would be light peach, but it&#x27;s darker on the skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is light to medium, and this product does not show up on me at all, except for maybe giving my cheeks a cakey look.  </li>
      <li>I use this as a soft blush and eye shadow for everyday,it&#x27;s perfect if you have yellow undertones to your skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light powder, so it&#x27;s better for dry skin than most powders.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an Asian Indian woman, with a rather fair complexion.</li>
      <li>If you want a dewey, light look, definitely try Dandelion because that stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
      <li>When I first got this powder, I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty, just have to know how to use it!</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin, so I should see at least a hint of color when I sweep this on my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute and creative, but not very useful.</li>
      <li>All that said I still love the product because it does subtly brighten up a fair complexion.</li>
      <li>It leaves such a soft glow, has a light pleasant fragrance,  and really helps even out my skin.  </li>
      <li>Buy the right product for you.</li>
      <li>Once I started using a different brush, and used it (lightly!)</li>
      <li>I just brushed it on my cheeks as if it were blush, and over the bridge of my nose, and over my eyelids, and up at the top of my forehead.</li>
      <li>When I purchased Georgia, I was expecting to receive a product that was a cross between a blush and a bronzer, for lack of a better description.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be more of a pressed powder for my entire face as opposed to a blusher.</li>
      <li>I liked Dandelion (still do), but it always seemed a bit too pink for me.</li>
      <li>Some of the reviewers are right - if you put too much on it looks too orange.</li>
      <li>I was definately satisfied with it and would recommend it for fair skinned women, especially redheads and blonds who find most blushes to be too dark or harshly colored.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m half latina, so I have lighter skin, but with a nice olive undertone.  </li>
      <li>If your skin is any shade darker than \\&quot;very fair\\&quot; then georgia is probably not for you (try dallas or hoola).  </li>
      <li>I have light skin with yellow undertones.  </li>
      <li>I use this product LIGHTLY all over my face with a different powder brush than supplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I agree with Gail&#x27;s review below about the color--it really is too peachy.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and was looking for a blush other than pink (I use Benetint normally and highly recommend it).  </li>
      <li>Evens out the skin, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t have a weird tint on me at all</li>
      <li>Instant awake-looking complexion, fresh and glowing.</li>
      <li>am of Irish and Czech decent and my skin has yellow undertones but flushes easily.</li>
      <li>It does not look very natural at all.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a teacher, so I have to get up very early in the morning.</li>
      <li>So I dipped my big Smashbox powder brush into Georgia and swirled it over my whole face -- PRESTO!</li>
      <li>If only Benefit would make a slightly darker version of this lovely powder</li>
      <li>I have red hair, green eyes, very pale skin, and a warm skin tone; Georgia looks fabulous on me.</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use a super dark or a super pink powder for a blushing effect.</li>
      <li>(Oh, I also have sensitive skin, and none of Benefit&#x27;s powders break me</li>
      <li>But unless you are looking to neutralize red cheeks or really dig a super-peachy look, I would say look for another blush.</li>
      <li>It leaves a natural, \\&quot;no make-up\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Luckily my blush lasts at least a year, so I put up with it ;)</li>
      <li>With foundation (and the original brush), it was a little too cakey.  </li>
      <li>:) It may seem a little pricey, but it lasts for a really long time!</li>
      <li>I saw a vintage hat once in an old general store display from the 1800&#x27;s - the hat had a peach satin lining, to cast a peachy glow on the complexion.</li>
      <li>by itself, it toned down my redness, and left me smelling peachy fresh! &lt;</li>
      <li>I understand what all of the other women were referring to when they asked \\&quot;What exactly do I do with this?\\</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Benefit&#x27;s Dandelion, which is very similar in texture/packaging, and far prefer it&#x27;s color to this one.</li>
      <li>It tones down my redness so much that I don&#x27;t need to use powder.</li>
      <li>This product tones down my redness with out completely removing my \\&quot;natural blush\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Georgia is a great alternative color, unlike the other reviewers I found the color to be quite subtle - almost too subtle - you have to put alot on the brush (which doesn&#x27;t work that well) and then blend it in.  </li>

<li> I like to use this sometimes as a highlighter for my eyes or to bring out my small chin.</li>
<li> very pale, freckly, and sometimes ruddy.</li>
<li> At least on a medium complexion like mine.</li>
<li> The color is subtle and you can use it to soften harsher blushes and eyeshadow</li>
<li> I was very skeptical about this product for a long time.</li>
<li> One Monday, I was exhausted -- and looked it.</li>
<li> I hope that others who are tempted to rate Georgia poorly will realize that it isn&#x27;t a bad product; it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;too peachy\\&quot;.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the same product as Dandelion, just a different color. If you look better in Dandelion, then buy Dandelion. Dandelion is too \\&quot;pinky\\&quot; for me. I have red hair, green eyes, very pale skin, and a warm skin tone; Georgia looks fabulous on me. I hope that others who are tempted to rate Georgia poorly will realize that it isn&#x27;t a bad product; it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;too peachy\\&quot;. It just isn&#x27;t for everyone. Buy the right product for you.</li>
    <li> First off, I am a very fair skinned girl. My entire family is fair skinned and fair haired Russians, Scandinavians, and Welsh people. I didn&#x27;t find this product to be too peachy--it just doesn&#x27;t show up well at all. All that said I still love the product because it does subtly brighten up a fair complexion. I like to use this sometimes as a highlighter for my eyes or to bring out my small chin. I&#x27;ve found it to be more of a pressed powder for my entire face as opposed to a blusher. A person would have to practically be albino for it to show up as a blush--but it&#x27;s still a great product. If only Benefit would make a slightly darker version of this lovely powder so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use a super dark or a super pink powder for a blushing effect.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin with a lot of red in it.  This powder evens out the red in my skin enough that I don&#x27;t need foundation and it gives me a nice, healthy looking glow that&#x27;s not too dark or peachy for my very fair skin.  It&#x27;s a very light powder, so it&#x27;s better for dry skin than most powders.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin &amp; blush can look clownish on me.This is not dense enough to wear alone but I sweep over my blush to lighten up &amp; blend it out.Works perfectly leaving a natural look &amp; the brush makes it a breeze &amp; saves time.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews about this powder, and decided to risk it anyhow. I understand what all of the other women were referring to when they asked \\&quot;What exactly do I do with this?\\&quot; It&#x27;s intended for redheads and those with redhead complexions... very pale, freckly, and sometimes ruddy. It&#x27;s for those who have never found a bronzing powder that didn&#x27;t look like dirty patches on their cheeks. Like me! So anyhow, I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the brush that was included. I just brushed it on my cheeks as if it were blush, and over the bridge of my nose, and over my eyelids, and up at the top of my forehead. It made me look like I WASN&#x27;T dead, which is a new winter experience for me.</li>
    <li> I love this face powder! I just dust it on in the morning and another around midday and my complexion looking good :) It may seem a little pricey, but it lasts for a really long time! I got my box of Georgia 3 years ago for my birthday, and I&#x27;m still using the same box. The only drawback with the brush is that the bristles eventually start falling out (as mine are now) but you can just use another brush to fix that. I love the peachy smell of this too! It&#x27;s so light and refreshing! This is a really subtle face powder, not much color but I use it for a sheer face powder, so it&#x27;s perfect! I definitely want to try out all the other boxed powders too.</li>
    <li> Some of the reviewers are right - if you put too much on it looks too orange. Not too \\&quot;peachy\\&quot; but DARK ORANGE. At least on a medium complexion like mine. HOWEVER... if you only use a little it&#x27;s very pretty. If you want a dewey, light look, definitely try Dandelion because that stuff is amazing. If you want a warmer color, this is the way to go. I thought it would be light peach, but it&#x27;s darker on the skin. It&#x27;s pretty, just have to know how to use it! So be warned!</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and was looking for a blush other than pink (I use Benetint normally and highly recommend it).  Georgia is a great alternative color, unlike the other reviewers I found the color to be quite subtle - almost too subtle - you have to put alot on the brush (which doesn&#x27;t work that well) and then blend it in.  But the color is beautiful, and does smell really nice.  I was definately satisfied with it and would recommend it for fair skinned women, especially redheads and blonds who find most blushes to be too dark or harshly colored.</li>
    <li> I use this product LIGHTLY all over my face with a different powder brush than supplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am of Irish and Czech decent and my skin has yellow undertones but flushes easily. This product tones down my redness with out completely removing my \\&quot;natural blush\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georga has a very light feel, wonderful texture and is ALMOST weightless on my skin.  It leaves a natural, \\&quot;no make-up\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geroga is definately peach colored, but then again, isn&#x27;t that what Georga is known for? Its famous peaches?</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product for a long time. I have Dandelion, Hoola, and Dallas, and I like them all. But Georgia? It looked so light I couldn&#x27;t imagine what I&#x27;d use it for. Then I read the reviews on Makeup Alley, and decided to give it a whirl. I&#x27;m a teacher, so I have to get up very early in the morning. One Monday, I was exhausted -- and looked it. So I dipped my big Smashbox powder brush into Georgia and swirled it over my whole face -- PRESTO! Instant awake-looking complexion, fresh and glowing. It shocked me, I have to say. I liked Dandelion (still do), but it always seemed a bit too pink for me. I have pale skin, blond hair and blue eyes. In the winter I can look like a ghost. But not now that I&#x27;ve found Georgia! I know that this review sounds over the top, but honestly, this stuff really works for me. (Oh, I also have sensitive skin, and none of Benefit&#x27;s powders break me out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see this stuff not working for people with darker complexions, so I understand the mixed reviews. But now I truly feel that Georgia is my number one tool in my makeup arsenal. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Asian Indian woman, with a rather fair complexion. Somehow this is the one powder that can make look brighter without making me paler. I get compliments on how \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; I look, even after dehydration and consecutive nights of sleep deprivation. :)</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I use it as all over face deal.  I&#x27;m half latina, so I have lighter skin, but with a nice olive undertone.  This worked well.  Evens out the skin, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t have a weird tint on me at all</li>
    <li> Definitely try on this product before you buy it.  If your skin is any shade darker than \\&quot;very fair\\&quot; then georgia is probably not for you (try dallas or hoola).  My skin is light to medium, and this product does not show up on me at all, except for maybe giving my cheeks a cakey look.  It does not look very natural at all.  I usually just dust a few swipes on my cheeks over my blush when I&#x27;ve accidentally applied too much, and it helps to tone it down a little.</li>
    <li> I use this as a soft blush and eye shadow for everyday,it&#x27;s perfect if you have yellow undertones to your skin.  The color is subtle and you can use it to soften harsher blushes and eyeshadow colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works perfectly with Benefit&#x27;s Hoola which I use for contouring.</li>
    <li> I recently ran across this product at Sephora. I started using it because I was told it was great for getting rid of redness in your skin. I tend to have a lot of redness in my cheeks and nose. Using this product has changed my skin. It tones down my redness so much that I don&#x27;t need to use powder. In addition I get a nice healthy glow!</li>
    <li> This lovely powder is better than blush...it is an all-over face enhancing powder. It isn&#x27;t too peachy or dark at all. I saw a vintage hat once in an old general store display from the 1800&#x27;s - the hat had a peach satin lining, to cast a peachy glow on the complexion. This powder has the same effect!</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and love this powder. It leaves such a soft glow, has a light pleasant fragrance,  and really helps even out my skin.  The reason for the 4 stars is just that is does leave a mess on my counter! :)  It&#x27;s my vengeance for having to wipe down the sink constantly.  Other than that, I will definitely buy this again and recommend it to others with similar skin type as myself.</li>
    <li> I have warm medium skin, and this blush does not show up. My go to blush is Benefit Dandelion, which looks perfect on me, but this color just doesn&#x27;t show up. I mix it sometimes with my face powder to add a bit of glow, buts that&#x27;s about all it does. Love Benefits products, but waaay too expensive! Luckily my blush lasts at least a year, so I put up with it ;)</li>
    <li> I agree with Gail&#x27;s review below about the color--it really is too peachy. However, the consistency of the product is great--it goes on smoothly and evenly, lasts for a while, and smells great. But unless you are looking to neutralize red cheeks or really dig a super-peachy look, I would say look for another blush. I&#x27;ve tried Benefit&#x27;s Dandelion, which is very similar in texture/packaging, and far prefer it&#x27;s color to this one.</li>
    <li> When I first got this powder, I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it.  I didn&#x27;t know if I should put it over foundation, or use it by itself.  With foundation (and the original brush), it was a little too cakey.  Once I started using a different brush, and used it (lightly!) by itself, it toned down my redness, and left me smelling peachy fresh! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t get a five because of the cumbersome brush.  It&#x27;s cute and creative, but not very useful.</li>
    <li> When I purchased Georgia, I was expecting to receive a product that was a cross between a blush and a bronzer, for lack of a better description. I am thoroughly disappointed with this product. I have very fair skin, so I should see at least a hint of color when I sweep this on my face. Instead, I see NOTHING. The only thing this product does is make my face smell like a peach...except its a strange, semi-unpleasant scent. Save your money and buy some Get Even Powder or some Benetint.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have light skin with yellow undertones.  This product is great.  I use it as an eyeshadow base and it makes my aquamarine eyes sparkle.  I use it as an all over face color, in place of powder and it makes my skin glow.  This is keeper in my book!</li>
