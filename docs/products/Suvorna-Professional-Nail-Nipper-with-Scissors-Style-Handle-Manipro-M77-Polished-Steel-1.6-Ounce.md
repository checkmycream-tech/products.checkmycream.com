    <li> I had been search high and low for this type of cuticle \\&quot;nipper\\&quot;.  This one is perfect.  I got the shorter model too.  I recommend the 4\\&quot; over the 3\\&quot;...just easier to use.</li>

    <li> I was looking for a new cuticle clipper. I was never a fan of the typical style. When I saw this scissor style one I was very excited. I was even more thrilled after I used it for the first time. It is very well made!!! It is extremely sharp and cuts extremely well all those hard to grasp and reach pieces of skin with ease!!! I would definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Love the scissor handles.</li>
    <li> These are really good nippers.  My other nippers were 3&amp;#34;,so I&#x27;m glad I got the 4&amp;#34; they are allot easier to use and are very sharp, the thumb holes are a bit larger than my others and more comfortable.  Glad I made the switch.</li>

MUCH higher quality, very sharp.  EXACTLY what I wanted!!!  6/11/15 Update: I still love them.  In fact, I just ordered a second pair.  Best nippers ever!</li>
    <li> Great workmanship. Highly recommend these. I plan on buying a second pair!&lt;br /&gt;These are the best nail nippers I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> These are worth every penny.  The shape is perfect for managing those cuticles.  You will not be disappointed.  Everyone in my family uses them now.</li>
    <li> I think it is a good product. Thanks</li>
    <li> I owned a pair of these &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; cuticle scissors years ago and could not longer find them in stores.  I found them here, and they are the best!!  They are made EXTREMELY well and work just as good as they look!!! and a big bonus... they come in a box (if your gifting) and they have a great leather keeper for them!!! Ordered a second pair to give as a gift...</li>
    <li> I ordered this pair of nippers and another at the same time.  These are much better and offer a smoother scissor action.  I like the longer neck as it makes it easier to see the cuticle.  These are very comfortable in the hand</li>
    <li> Best ever! Very sharp and easy to control. Nice clean cut with no effort. Comes in a little faux leather cover. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These arrived on time.  They do not work on my finger or toe nails.  They just don&#x27;t cut at all.  I will probably take them to Good will.</li>
    <li> They are very, very sharp, so a steady hand is needed to use these.  They are a really good product, if you have a steady hand.</li>
    <li> These are just like the Revlon ones my mom bought years ago. I&#x27;m so glad I found them! They are perfect!</li>
    <li> They are a bit bigger than I&#x27;m used to but work very well.</li>
    <li> I too have searched high and low for this style of cuticle nipper, and have happily found them. They are sharp, as in VERY sharp, and so easy to handle. They come in a nice little case that keeps them protected. I use them daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of getting a second pair for back-up, though I don&#x27;t doubt these will last me for the rest of my days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear, if I want it, Amazon has it. I&#x27;m a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this would stand up against other clippers -- this is actually the only one I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Very sharp, &amp; after a slight learning curve, LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I like these cuticle scissors because they fit your hand much better than the traditional nippers. They are sharp and easy to use.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> These nail nippers work well and seem to be made very well.  Although somewhat larger than the ones they replaced, they are the only ones that I could find at a affordable price.</li>
    <li> My wife says that it works ok</li>
    <li> I love it, quality and again very sharp! !</li>
    <li> The quality of these nippers is not bad but I found it not comfortable to use at all.  I guess scissors style should be left for scissors...</li>
    <li> Love the scissors action rather than the more common style. Extremely sharp &amp; easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very sharp nail scissors that get the trim done quickly.</li>
    <li> I gave these four stars because they are a little too long for my taste, and the precision is not as good as I would like.  But, they are very sharp and do the job.</li>
    <li> They work well, come in a nice container (leather?) and are quite sharp.  I much prefer these to nippers with a spring.  They work well and are the best nipper product I have purchased!</li>
