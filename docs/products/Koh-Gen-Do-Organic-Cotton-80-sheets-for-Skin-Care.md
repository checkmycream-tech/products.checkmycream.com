    <li> Excellent for wicking, great taste! 80 sheets is enough to last a LONG time. WIll purchase again in the future if I need them.</li>
    <li> Conveniently comes in sheets for use. Cheap and tastes great! I&#x27;ll buy again if I run out</li>
    <li> Great for your rda&#x27;s rta&#x27;s,great flavor. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for vaporizers.  I use it daily, without issue.  I will buy more as I need it.  It will last a LONG time in the amount you receive with this purchase. Any questions, please ask</li>
    <li> Picked this up shortly after getting my first RDA (tugboat clone) and a Sigelei 150w box mod. This cotton is great! It wicks up the juice perfectly and is very easy to work with. I&#x27;ve been using it in my Kanger Subtank Mini as well, and this cotton is perfect when using the rebuildable deck. I highly recommend this cotton for wicking!</li>
    <li> This cotton is beyond awesome. Words cannot describe how Streamley happy i am. If you use this Cotton you will never use any other cotton again.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely happy with the sellers delivery time. Yes I would definitely recommend this to friends family and anyone else.</li>
    <li> Good quality, excellent for vaping, and a great price for the amount that you&#x27;re getting. Will beat any vape shops prices definiely.</li>
    <li> This is the best wicking cotton for vaping. Good price also.</li>
    <li> Great cotton to use with vaporizers.  I&#x27;ve wicked a few different atty&#x27;s with this and have not been disappointed whatsoever.  Great cotton at a great price.  Probably works well to clean your face or whatever people normally use this stuff for too but I haven&#x27;t tried that.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the taste of it....used for re wicking the coils on my personal vapor</li>
    <li> Great cotton that&#x27;s perfect for wicking in e-cigarettes. Easy to cut and work with, more than enough for a while too. My girlfriend says it&#x27;s great for her makeup and girl stuff so I guess that&#x27;s another plus.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality cotton for vaping! Separate the outside layer from the inside and you are good to go. Excellent flavor from the first draw.</li>
    <li> Works just like it should and its better than buying from ee baay.</li>
    <li> its the real deal and there is a ton here.</li>
    <li> Great product at an even better price. Shipping was on point considering it came all the way from Japan. A+++</li>
    <li> Good for your vapor needs</li>
    <li> This will last you like a year or more</li>
    <li> much better than cotton balls</li>
    <li> Very fast shippment. Exactly what I expected, and nothing less. Good cotton</li>
    <li> These are very soft cotton sheets. However, they leave a trail of lint on my face and the lint also gets into my eyes.</li>
    <li> Did I say it was cotton.</li>
    <li> Just perfect. I use these for vaping, and let me tell you the flavor is stellar!! and you can&#x27;t beat the price! These will last me a very long time!</li>
    <li> The product is good, I used it for my box mod vaporizer. Would recommend to anyone that vapes.</li>
    <li> Works great on my Kanger subtank mini as well as my Velocity clone. I would honestly give it 4.5 stars because the tops layers of the cotton are NOT as fluffy as I would like, but not much can be done there. Aside from that, they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> Everything they claim has proven true to me.</li>
    <li> I use this for wicking my rda&#x27;s. It is strong enough to slide through coil builds without coming apart yet is very soft to the touch. This cotton allows the full flavor of my e-liq to come through without the addition of a &amp;#34;cotton flavor&amp;#34; to it. Will re-order when in need of more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M A 5 YEAR VAPOR and after FUKUSHIMA i still used, but no more,not worth the risk for me if grown anywhere near japan,make your choice,cotton bacon american grown nice.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff. Well, this and Muji. If you&#x27;re looking for wicking. Much better than puffs brand.</li>
    <li> Works as intended for e cig use. No bad taste. Easy to cut and wick.</li>
    <li> Great flavor in my mod and absorbs well</li>
    <li> Working great for my wicking and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These sheets are fantastic</li>
    <li> Simply amazing I will probably only buy this cotton for now on!</li>
    <li> exactly what you need for all your wicking needs. I change wicks pretty often and I still haven&#x27;t even made a dent in this bag. Quality is superb and the wicking properties are superb</li>
    <li> Works great for vapes, all I use now</li>
    <li> These cotton square are much bigger than the Shiseido cotton squares that normally use except these are MUCH softer. Not sure if I will be purchasing again just because I feel like I&#x27;m wasting half a square just for toner and essence.</li>
    <li> Used for vaping. A little goes a long way. Wicks very well (even with heavy VG blend). The juice taste comes through nicely. Used to use organic cotton for a few years and this is much better.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Will last forever! !</li>
    <li> Item as described, makes great wicks for vaping</li>
    <li> Fan-bloody-tastic.  Wicks like a charm.  GET IT!</li>
    <li> Im very happy with this Item. My vaping experience is better. I would order again.</li>
    <li> Will order again!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Outstanding cotton product for wicking material on my RTA &amp; RDAs. Holds juice well and has a nice, clean taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses it for skin care and also sweats by it. win win.</li>
    <li> I use for building wicks for vaping, great quality and the sheets are convenient for knowing how much to use, and no cotton taste the first time I use a new wick.</li>
    <li> Delivered as described.</li>
    <li> Fast ship, item as described. Probably works very well for intended purpose. I use it for wicking and it is great right out of the bag with no added flavor. a quick cut along the fibers and voila - instant wick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I ever need it I would buy this very same thing, but I think it will be a very long time!</li>
    <li> HOLY cotton. I bought this for my e-cig builds, but didnt realize how much there was in here! by my math i will have more cotton than i can use.... i use 1/12 square, and that lasts usually about 4 days....x80 sheets&#x3D; about 11 years. It also works well to clean up little messes</li>
    <li> Very good cotton to use for wicking RDAs!</li>
    <li> Just as expected.  Fast shipping.  Cotton nice and soft.  Use it for wicking material on vaping devices.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a must have for vapers! It might be a little pricey, but well worth the extra money. There is enough cotton to last me at least a year or two. This stuff wicks so much better and seems to hold so much more liquid than organic cotton. Plus there&#x27;s no taste at all with this stuff. If you are a vaper, buy this stuff to use for your wicks, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Amazing cotton for vaping, holds more juice than anything I&#x27;ve used before and very easy to work with. This batch alone is going to last me well over a year unless I&#x27;m re-wicking and changing flavors a lot. Each sheet pulls apart to create two sheets and you cut strips out of one of those to start wicking.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Superior product.</li>
    <li> night and day difference from regular organic cotton.</li>
    <li> Great taste. Great price.</li>
    <li> Works great holds the juice nice, little pricy thow but nice</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and far exceeded my expectations! I will definitely be ordering it again as soon as I start running low! Great price and fast shipping! It works perfect for those of you who need a quality cotton for vaping.</li>
    <li> I use this cotton in my RDA&#x27;s for vaping. The price is a little steep, but these should last you for a really long time. The flavor really come through when using these with your favorite ejuice--very clean.</li>
    <li> Works well. Use it and Cotton Bacon.</li>
    <li> All natural Japanese cotton! Woo</li>
    <li> Use this for my vapors! best i&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Best wicking material ever and 80 sheets will last a very long time.  It&#x27;s probably good at what it&#x27;s originally intended for too.  Shipping was much faster than predicted as I was originally quoted end of Nov. 1st week Dec and it came in about 10days.</li>
    <li> best cotton in market, super quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Wow. Best japanese cotton ive ever used, and a LOT of it, for cheap. Sweet.</li>
    <li> Product is as described. Very high quality cotton. I have been using this for my vaping needs and it is far superior to regular organic cotton balls. With cotton balls i found that no matter what I would start to get burnt wicks usually within a week of changing wicks. With this Koh Gen Do cotton I have been using the same cotton for 3 weeks now and still no burns. Flavor quality is very good. Koh Gen Do doesnt have that &amp;#34;cotton&amp;#34; taste to it like regular cotton balls seem to have no matter what.</li>
    <li> I use this as a wick for my vaping gear. Can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and regular cotton balls. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I do not find the way to do a good wick for my vaporizer, I&#x27;ll keep trying, for now I can not give more than 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Before you read this review, know that the I purchased this cotton for rebuilding Kangertech Subtank coils. This cotton worked pretty well when replacing the cotton in the coils, but has a short life span. Some reviews said that it produced a better taste than the original coils, but I found that to be false. So if you don&#x27;t mind rebuilding the coils constantly (which is actually a pretty quick and simple operation), this is a good cotton choice. It is also enough cotton to last what seems like a lifetime.</li>
    <li> WickS great ! I would definitely recommend it .</li>
    <li> A great deal for the amount of product for the money. I should have enough to make years and years of wick material for my rba/rda coils before I even think of wick material again, thanks for the bargain.</li>
    <li> High quality product &amp; excellent delivery time. I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> It arrived a week early, and the cotton is the best cotton I&#x27;ve dealt with to date. Only thing is you have to get used to it being in square pads, you&#x27;ll have your coil measurements in no time.</li>
    <li> Works great for vaping</li>
    <li> perfect for ecig coils</li>
    <li> Works great for e-cig wicks.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it for skin</li>
    <li> Great product and amazing eSeller, fast and reliable. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> To expensive for cotton but it&#x27;s awesome cotton</li>
    <li> 2 year vaper here. This stuff is great. Better flow &amp; flavor profile than cotton balls. Will purchase again (if I ever run out, not even 1/6 of the way).</li>
    <li> Cheap price for a great product</li>
    <li> These are exactly as advertised. Great quality with a great price. I used these for wicking material in my RDA, and I can tell any vaper out there that this is a much better buy than the 1-2 sheets at a time.</li>
    <li> Looking through the other reviews, you can clearly see this product isn&#x27;t being used as intended. If you&#x27;re looking to pick up &amp;#34;Japanese Cotton&amp;#34; for RBAs/RTAs, this is the stuff you want. You might be thrown off by the price, but this bag will literally last you a lifetime. I cut about a 1/4 inch wide and 1 inch long strip (along the grain) for my Lemo and it fits in perfectly. I use the entire piece of cotton, some people pick off the &amp;#34;harder&amp;#34; outer layer and just use the soft and squishy insides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Big bag of cotton, if you&#x27;re the generous type, give some out to your friends and be admired.&lt;br /&gt;Great wicking (I use max vg and it just soaks it right up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Sometimes difficult to get cotton through coil, but practices makes perfect.</li>
    <li> Good quality cotton for vaping needs.</li>
    <li> these are exactly what i expected, you can pull each sheet apart to make 2 sheets out of 1!</li>
    <li> Ive used organic Japanese cotton and this is real popular with vapers and at 19.00 plus shipping its a steal and 80 sheets is going to last me a year or more</li>
    <li> Very good Cotton!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> Some really good dripping cotton here! Buy it, You&#x27;ll be glad you did!!</li>
    <li> VERY SOFT ON THE SKIN</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. You know why you are buying it, and it wicks beautifully. Wicks so nice that you should have no issues using up to 90% VG juices in those RTA&#x27;s, even the new sub ohm tanks.</li>
    <li> best wicking material</li>
    <li> pre-note: I use this as my vaping cotton as I don&#x27;t have to boil it or prepare it in any way beforehand, I just take out of the bag, cut a proper size(it DID take some experimenting!), wick my coils and I&#x27;m GOOD TO GO.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased March 2nd, 2015. Have barely made a DENT in this cotton supply. Hell I even share it with my friends. While it won&#x27;t last a &amp;#34;lifetime&amp;#34; I also go through a LOT of juice and am about to start mixing my own juices to compensate for prices. A single new wicking lasts a couple weeks. Wicking a new build takes VARYING amounts depending on the diameter of the opening of your coils and if you do a dual or single coil. I strictly use dual coils. To quote a question answered above &amp;#34;Each pad is 3.25 inches by 2.25 inches.&amp;#34; if I cut on average 1/4 of an inch (0.25 :-) length-wise this means 9 total strips per pad. I&#x27;d say on average this lasts me 2 weeks per wick (though this can DRASTICALLY change within even 0.1 inch per build... slightly too small or big can cause excess gunking on any cotton and significantly affect the amount of time cotton lasts!). But let&#x27;s give it an average 2 weeks at 1/4 inch lengthwise per build. 9(strips)*80(pads)*2(weeks)&#x3D;1440 weeks&lt;br /&gt;1 year is approximately 52.1785714 weeks. if we do the math 1440 weeks is 27.5975258 years! So.... LOTS AND LOTS OF WICKING TIME is basically whats happening here.&lt;br /&gt;Cotton with no additional flavour, lots of time to vape since it has doesn&#x27;t BURN easily as a wick AND wicks nicely(moves juice straight to the coils quickly), and sheer amount of wicking material.... currently 12 bux for 27 years?!?! to quote Shia: JUST DO IT.</li>
    <li> I use koh gen do japanese cotton for wicking my rebuildable dripping attys &amp; let me tell you... This stuff works great... Best cotton I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. This one bag will last me for over a year I&#x27;m sure. I Will be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> I used it for vaping. I was skeptical about it vaping as good as people say but was pleasantly surprised. It vapes great and adds no real noticeable flavor from the first puff. Also very good to work with into the coil.Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> No need to boil no foul flavor a bit spendy butt it&#x27;ll last you a couple years.</li>
