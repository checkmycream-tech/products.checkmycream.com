      <li>great for me because I&#x27;m very sensitive to chemical smells</li>
      <li>Great for people sensitive to fragrance.</li>
      <li>It has no scent, so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>But the product is wonderful, for I have severe allergies and it doesn&#x27;t bother me like other sprays do.</li>
      <li>It does such a great job of being light but holding my hair in place!</li>
      <li>Easy to manipulate.  </li>
      <li>I strongly reccomend.</li>
      <li>This hairspray is truly fragrance free and the soft hold is great for fine hair.</li>
      <li>Works fine.  </li>
      <li>totally odor free, and works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it with a light spray and you still can&#x27;t get a wide-bristled brush through it.  </li>
      <li>Now I can enjoy the fruits of my labor longer.</li>
      <li>Light hold without any perfumes.</li>
      <li>I need a spray that is unscented after it dries and this seems to fit the bill.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I like a natural, soft hold hairspray and this is perfect.</li>
      <li>It does have a strong alcohol odor when it is sprayed on, but it goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, especially for people with sensitive scalp or allergies.</li>
      <li>Both my husband and I have sensitive skin, and Free &amp; Clear does not irritate and holds beautifully.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a pretty strong hold.  </li>
      <li>Delivery is always quick.</li>
      <li>Well, with Jhirmack unscented unavailable, this is definitely the next best</li>
      <li>This works great leaves a good hold without being too sticky however does leave hair a little greasy the next day.</li>
      <li>I was purchasing another brand of &#x27;free&#x27; (without so many chemicals, unscented) hairspray but could no longer find in available in local pharmacies, dept. stores, etc.</li>
      <li>This spray acts more like normal hairspray; no flaking even if I brush through it.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to report that it really is fragrance free unlike some other products which claim to be but are not.  </li>
      <li>and it does a reasonably good job of keeping my loose curling iron waves in place.</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight hair</li>
      <li>Great hold without any heavy stickiness.  </li>
      <li>Good hairspray not to heavy or light.</li>
      <li>so I searched for a fragrance free hair spray and found the Free &amp; Clear brand.  </li>
      <li>I think it holds about as good as any other hair spray and because it&#x27;s a pump dispenser</li>
      <li>My hair is very short and fine, the soft hold gives it a  more &#x27;natural&#x27;, clean, shiny hold &amp; look - fine with me!  </li>
      <li>Once you get the hang of how much to spray, super</li>
      <li>Wish they had one more in the middle.  </li>
      <li>I like Free and clear products</li>
      <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It holds well without making a glue-head and it truly is unscented (unlike &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; products at the store that have &amp;#34;masking perfume&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>Free and Clear is on the list given me by my dermatologist.</li>
      <li>It also gives a bit of extra shine to my hair:)</li>
      <li>This was the first time I found the hair spray.  </li>
      <li>Using Free &amp; Clear the break out is almost non-existent.</li>
      <li>Free and Clear hair spray was not stickey and did the job even in humid weather.</li>
      <li>I am very scent sensitive and find that even the products that claim to be scent free are not.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can run my fingers during the day and my hair still feels soft and clean.</li>
      <li>The natural part is good, but the soft hold does not work as good as the firm hold of this same product.</li>
      <li>It comes out in a very fine mist, doesn&#x27;t wet your hair.</li>
      <li>The only thing I wish is that the spray was a little &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; but with any non-aresol product, that can be a problem and this one is better than many others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Really like the way my hair comes out.  </li>
      <li>This really doesn&#x27;t have any odor which is what I wanted</li>
      <li>The product works very well although it is a bit pricey compared to store brands.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>/&gt;He loves the product in that it does what he wants - holds his hair in place without it looking like a helmet:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>All-in-all, I really like this product and will be buying more in the near future.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff, no scent, my hubby is allegic to any kind of scented product, he does not even know when I use this hairsprsy,</li>
    <li> not strong enough to hold my very fine hair.</li>
    <li> I like this hair spray. It comes out in a very fine mist, doesn&#x27;t wet your hair. It is a soft hold and brushable.</li>
    <li> The natural part is good, but the soft hold does not work as good as the firm hold of this same product.</li>
    <li> It leaves hair soft, but any hold?????  Not really.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I like other free and clear products though.</li>
    <li> I got a new short haircut that would not stay the way I wanted it because my hair is so fine.  I have a problem with fragrances so I searched for a fragrance free hair spray and found the Free &amp; Clear brand.  I am happy to report that it really is fragrance free unlike some other products which claim to be but are not.  You can get a soft hold or stronger hold depending on the amount you use.</li>
    <li> My husband is highly sensitive to hairsprays, etc. Previously, in order to spray my hair, I had to go into another bathroom, shut the door, run the overhead fan,  spray my hair and stay inside the bathroom for a while. Usually he would happen by soon after and would start coughing and hacking, saying,\\&quot;That stuff kills me!\\&quot;  I haven&#x27;t told him I got the new spray. I am still going into the same bathroom, but so far he hasn&#x27;t seem to notice when I spray my hair. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Kind of sticky and it isn&#x27;t soft hold it is no hold. Good for flyaway hair</li>
    <li> I wanted a hair spray that holds a style and I could comb through without feeling as though I&#x27;m damaging the hair. This product allows me to comb through, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a style!  It needs more holding power.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair with a perm.  I put the hair spray on fairly heavy and it works well.  However, you cannot brush your hair once it dries.  You can use a pick.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is called soft hold - it seems like a firm hold to me.  I&#x27;ve tried it with a light spray and you still can&#x27;t get a wide-bristled brush through it.  The best part is no fragrance!</li>
    <li> This really doesn&#x27;t have any odor which is what I wanted but it also has very limited holding power. It says you can use it for styling also but this didn&#x27;t seem to add anything.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Dad when I learned my Mom was entering their bedroom, bath area with kleenex stuffed in her nose.  He had gotten a new hairspray which I could smell almost upon entering the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves the product in that it does what he wants - holds his hair in place without it looking like a helmet:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom loves this product in that she no longer has to stuff Kleenex in her nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product because this time when i was at their house, I could actually sit in Dad&#x27;s leather chair, leaning back my head against the headrest and its residual hair spray, without my chest tightening up and asking my Mom to pass the Kleenex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - pretty good deal.  And given that I am extremely sensitive to all chemicals, somewhat like a canary in the coal mines, that is a pretty high recommendation.</li>
    <li> The product works very well although it is a bit pricey compared to store brands. The other issue I had was it came without the plastic cap it goes over the spray nozzle.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of how much to spray, super</li>
    <li> Finally, a hair spray that will not cause dermatitis. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on nearby objects and the floor like other sprays. Use the strong hold in the morning, just a little, and use this if I need to reapply.</li>
    <li> I like this spray a lot but not the sprayer it comes in . Sprays a little wet . I can get another bottle to put it in though. It doesn&#x27;t make my scalp breakout like so many with chemicals that are harsh. Good hairspray not to heavy or light. I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended product line. Have used product line several years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hairsprays and they get flaky.  This spray acts more like normal hairspray; no flaking even if I brush through it.  It is not totally unscented, but close--it has a slight scent when sprayed, much less than scented sprays.  I need a spray that is unscented after it dries and this seems to fit the bill.</li>
    <li> It leaves a sticky film on my hair.  It definitley is not a brushable hairspray.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has allergy issues.  It holds well - I have very fine thinnish hair and so the last time I purchased this, I bought the Firm Hold.  Very good products - comparable to salon products.</li>
    <li> Finally.  I can get some hold on a hairstyle without paying for it with a migraine.  I am very scent sensitive and find that even the products that claim to be scent free are not.&lt;br /&gt;Environmentally I like that this is a pump not aerosol.  The hold is nice but doesn&#x27;t look or feel gooey on my hair. I have fine hair that loses the body I blow dry into it readily.  Now I can enjoy the fruits of my labor longer.</li>
    <li> In the past all other hair spray products I have used have provoked allergic reactions.  This product does not.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Allergy testing requires that I use only certain products. Free and Clear is on the list given me by my dermatologist. AMAZON was the only place that I could find the gel and hair sprays. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was purchasing another brand of &#x27;free&#x27; (without so many chemicals, unscented) hairspray but could no longer find in available in local pharmacies, dept. stores, etc. so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  My hair is very short and fine, the soft hold gives it a  more &#x27;natural&#x27;, clean, shiny hold &amp; look - fine with me!  Sure do hate that &#x27;thick&#x27;, overly scented, stiff, brick-head hairspray.</li>
    <li> I have very bad allergies and have a hard time tolerating things with fragrance so I love that this has no fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been trying to get away from areosol products as well and this fits the bill.  The only thing I wish is that the spray was a little &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; but with any non-aresol product, that can be a problem and this one is better than many others I&#x27;ve tried.  All-in-all, I really like this product and will be buying more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Spray lightly; it has a stiff hold. Also, rinse spray nozzle frequently or it will stick. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Great for people sensitive to fragrance. There is no fragrance. I bought both firm and soft both are fragrance free Firm is just that, it holds better in wind. I am an asthmatic. no bothering me.</li>
    <li> This is a very basic SOFT hold hairspray.  I have skin allergies and this is a better choice than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It certainly is not a hairspray to hold your hair for hours but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for; I like soft.  4 stars because I think the product is overpriced.  Still, I will defiantly  continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I am highly sensitive to fragrances and have no problem with this product. It does have a strong alcohol odor when it is sprayed on, but it goes away quickly. I have fine, straight hair and it does a reasonably good job of keeping my loose curling iron waves in place. It also gives a bit of extra shine to my hair:) Also, the pump part works well. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Good price and timely delivery!</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be unscented, but it had some scent to which I was sensitive.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I have a hard time finding products that I do not break out from. So far I have had no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> Really like this product and has no negative effeect on my sensitive skin.  I strongly reccomend. Delivery is always quick.</li>
    <li> Great hold without any heavy stickiness.  Never liked non-aerosols before, then changed to Free &amp; Clear due to severe allergies, and this product is on my &amp;#34;safe product&amp;#34; list by The Mayo Clinic, so I bought it.  Now it&#x27;s what I use everyday and I love it.  I can run my fingers during the day and my hair still feels soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  It has no scent, so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.  Also, in the summer, there is no insects are attracted to it like they are to scented sprays!</li>
    <li> My wife is a cancer survivor and with that she is more aware now that some hair sprays and other household goods contain irritants or are at least somewhat toxic to the body.I think it holds about as good as any other hair spray and because it&#x27;s a pump dispenser it&#x27;s better environmentally speaking. A little on the pricey side.</li>
    <li> Didnt like this hair spray  .It judt seemed to wet my hair down and make it sticky.</li>
    <li> I am extremely allergic to any perfumes, chemicals basically most fragrances. As a result, I am always searching for a product that truly is fragrance-free and this one lived up to it&#x27;s name! Extremely happy I found this one. I like the soft hold since the hard didn&#x27;t work well for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is truly fragrance free and the soft hold is great for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and the hairspray I was using was causing major breakouts around my neck and hairline.  I decided to find a &#x27;free and clear&#x27; hairspray to cut down on the chemicals that were in contact with my skin.  My skin has definitely started to clear up since I started using this product.  However, it definitely leaves that distinct &#x27;crunchy&#x27; feeling.  I got the soft hold and it&#x27;s a pretty strong hold.  I imagine the firm hold would be more like concrete!&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this product because it&#x27;s one of the only ones that won&#x27;t cause me to break out; however, I wish it was a softer hold as it claims.</li>
    <li> Great Hairspray.  Easy to manipulate.  No fragrance.  My skins was very sensitive to hairspray.  Breaking out all the time.  Using Free &amp; Clear the break out is almost non-existent.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I have very sensitive skin and cannot use spray with fragrance. This works great leaves a good hold without being too sticky however does leave hair a little greasy the next day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months. It&#x27;s OK. When I use it with my straightener, it makes my hair look and feel brittle and dry. Does it hold? Yes, but I just don&#x27;t like the feeling of my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this because it tames problem hair with no scent and it is not sticky.</li>
    <li> This hairspray works for me.  My face does not itch as it does with most.</li>
    <li> I have no place to buy this locally. Amazon is the good place to get it. This is the only hairspray that I can use at this time. Thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m severely sensitive to smells and have tried just about every hairspray out there.  Other fragrance free sprays still have a smell that lingers.  I smell this one a little bit when I first apply it but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Great product that holds well and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin.  I like the pump sprayer as well.  I will use it forever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this brand for a long time.  They always do good.  This was the first time I found the hair spray.  I love it.</li>
    <li> One of the few products available to  a balsam of peru allergy patient.</li>
    <li> Free and Clear hair spray was not stickey and did the job even in humid weather. I like that I do not have to smell my hairspray all day long...and by the way it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;hair spray&amp;#34; it&#x27;s a pump bottle, so be careful how much you use. No need to go wild.</li>
    <li> Terrible for chemical sensitivity, dried hair out,and had chemical reaction,I think to the alcohol</li>
    <li> Have used this hairspray for years. Does not bother my allergies.</li>
    <li> Other hairsprays make my head itch, as I am sensitive to artificial fragrances. I like a natural, soft hold hairspray and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this spray.  Easy on the hair and not as heavy as a the other spray.  Wish they had one more in the middle.  I will continue to buy this.  Really like the way my hair comes out.  Excellent</li>
    <li> This works as described and since I can only use free &amp; clear products this works for me.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray without fragrance but wish it held just a bit better. It does say &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; so that is what you get. Don&#x27;t plan on a heavy hold, or even medium hold.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair, so hairsprays are a dicey proposition for me, but I love this product. It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive, there is no scent, it provides a firm, but gentle hold and there is no evidence that you&#x27;re using a hairspray. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It does the job I want, no scene and not too firm. I like it. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> unfortunately, this hairspray did not work well with my allergies. If it had, I would continue to buy it. Held my hair nicely without being sticky.</li>
    <li> The plunger is a little stiff.  Must h old container with both hands to depress it and spray my hair.</li>
    <li> It arrived in good condition. I&#x27;ve used this product before and like it.</li>
    <li> Very good for my wife skin</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m allergic to perfume and this doesn&#x27;t have any. Plus it leaves my hair soft and not stiff.</li>
    <li> Hairspray used to break my face out along the hairline in itchy, red bumps.  This product is wonderful and I have not had a breakout since.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Well, with Jhirmack unscented unavailable, this is definitely the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;It holds well without making a glue-head and it truly is unscented (unlike &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; products at the store that have &amp;#34;masking perfume&amp;#34;).</li>
    <li> This product holds well and does not cause allergic reactions (I am chemical sensitive). I&#x27;ve been buying it for about 2 years now.  I also buy their Vanicream face Soap.  See my review.</li>
    <li> I am required to use this product because of chemical allergies.  It works as well as any other hair spray I&#x27;ve used  but without the chemicals and fragrance.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair spray!! It does such a great job of being light but holding my hair in place!</li>
    <li> For me, this product does nothing to control the wispy strands of hair.  Maybe it will work for you?.</li>
    <li> Product holds well and allows later combing without feeling like a stiff helmet. Order came quickly and was priced over $20 less than what I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> This is hard to find at a local drugstore so the ease of online ordering and fast service makes this the way to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of hairspray.  Don&#x27;t like the smell or the stiff feel, but I have very fine hair, and would like to use something occassionally.  It is very good in that  it really is odorless, but does nothing to keep hair in place.  I wouldn&#x27; buy again.</li>
    <li> totally odor free, and works great. great for me because I&#x27;m very sensitive to chemical smells</li>
    <li> I like the soft hold and great for my sensitive skin, my only complaint is the spray pump, that needs to be improved or they need another nozzle choice.  That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> As stated this hairspray doesn&#x27;t have the sticky hold as the commercial hairspray. Leaves hair in place naturally.  And non-allergy without harsh chemicals.  Will always use this and highly recommend for non-allergy and allergy users.</li>
    <li> We love this hairspray!  Both my husband and I have sensitive skin, and Free &amp; Clear does not irritate and holds beautifully.  It is a great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, especially for people with sensitive scalp or allergies.</li>
    <li> I bought this soft hold hairspray because it is unscented.  I like it.  It holds my mostly straight, slightly wavy on humid days, hair, and gives it some shine.  It&#x27;s not sticky or hard and a little spray or two is enough for me.</li>
    <li> It works great for me.Suggested by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Does not make your hair feel lacquered. I like Free and clear products</li>
    <li> With my weird fragrance allergies, my choices are limited.  This gives good hold and is easy to use.  I have been using it for about 5 years and I like it.  I did have one or two bottles clog on me and couldn&#x27;t get them open, but I just waited until I used another bottle and poured the liquid into that bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is what I wanted.  Light hold without any perfumes. Nice to find something as advertised and promptly received.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray, been using it for years.  I was getting it elsewhere until I found it here. It seems they have changed the pump/sprayer on it and I can&#x27;t use it, have to pour it into one of the old bottles that I kept.  Wish they could make it easier to spray, for I have arthritis in my hands and it makes it impossible to use.  But the product is wonderful, for I have severe allergies and it doesn&#x27;t bother me like other sprays do.</li>
