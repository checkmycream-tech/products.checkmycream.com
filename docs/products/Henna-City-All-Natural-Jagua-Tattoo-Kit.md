      <li>Will def be ordering more.</li>
      <li>and it comes with more tips.</li>
      <li>I think the kit could use some more designs though.  </li>
      <li>better than henna and lasts longer too</li>
      <li>Went to sleep and woke up with the tattoo transferred onto my face:)</li>
      <li>Great product fast shipping</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the way some parts are faded and some parts are darker, but probably speaks more to my ability to apply it than anything else.</li>
      <li>Comes in a cute bag.</li>
      <li>I love that there are 4 tips.  </li>
      <li>my favorite Jagua Tattoo kit out there.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love it .</li>
      <li>Also more convenient that it comes premixed.</li>
      <li>The gel comes premixed which I also love and is very smooth and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This product arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Wish I could give half stars as this item was &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; perfect.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery!  </li>
      <li>I purchased this one since money was tight so the price is great too, lowest one I found!</li>
      <li>Love it everyone thinks it&#x27;s a real tattoo!!</li>
      <li>DOESNT FIT...</li>
      <li>It came with plenty of tips to spread the ink and plenty of stencils if not adventuring free hand.  </li>
      <li>It comes with a descent amount of jagua gel and the tattoos it comes with are fantastic.</li>
      <li>This is a great alternative to traditional brown henna.</li>
      <li>A fun kit, it had way more henna</li>
      <li>Not only is the ink top quality, but the seller was good.</li>
      <li>and  next week I am placing an order for more !!</li>
      <li>The interchangeable nozzles are very handy for different types of art.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad I found this because I was looking for something that would last on my skin and was safe.</li>
      <li>From very fine for intricate work and large flr filling things in.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and fun for a group.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is that it has to be refrigerated between uses to stay good, but its worth it!</li>
      <li>Of the five sheets of stencils, one was a duplicate, and I found most of the designs rather large.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you put the ink in the fridge right away, this made the ink that much more potent and allowed for the tattoo to look sharper and last longer.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t suit everyone but its a pretty good solution if you&#x27;re looking for a natural product that stains the skin.</li>
      <li>After today I will discard the rest and will be purchasing some henna which is much cheaper than this product but works 10 times better.</li>
      <li>The kit came with the four different sized tips and I loved them- it allowed for intricate designs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good Product ... product as described.</li>
    <li> Had an allergic reaction. Had to be hospitalized and given steroids for 30 days. Not fun.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. I got an allergic reaction. Swollen, itchy, and really red. Miserable....</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping and product worked just like it says! A+++ Thank you</li>
    <li> A fun safe product, very versatile , the essential oil blend smells wonderful , nice and natural , looks very dark and stays dark for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Funny fact when you first rinse it off it seems to be faint but gets really dark  a little while after .&lt;br /&gt;Kids and teenagers love it because it looks like a tattoo.</li>
    <li> This comes out amazing, almost too amazing! Everywhere I smudged instantly stained my skin black! The designs came out beautifully though. Really good buy.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite Jagua Tattoo kit out there. I was very impressed with the box and the instructions that came inside. Their transfer design sheets are great, offering a ton of unique designs! As far as the gel goes, I really like it that I don&#x27;t have to mix it myself; it&#x27;s already the perfect consistency.  I also like the fact that it comes with the different sized tips.  I use the black one the most (second smallest). At first it is very easy to squeeze out of the bottle, but once it gets down about half-full, it does become slightly more difficult to squeeze out, sometimes causing your hand to shake; but that&#x27;s to be expected.  I am very happy with the way the stain comes out! Nice and dark depending on where you put it. I will say though, when I used the transfers, it seemed as if the Jagua did not completely take to my skin as if I were just doing it free-hand.  But it still came out looking good.  Now that I have the kit, I will more than likely be buying the gel from Henna City again!</li>
    <li> I have used this many times and everyone loves it! No allergic reactions and it looks great.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves it. Its much better than the real permanent thing, dark and real looking</li>
    <li> This was great ... I exceeded my expectations .... Looks like a real tattoo .. and disappears in 6 days</li>
    <li> This product works really well and lasts longer than the original henna that you would get in the shopping centers. The stencils that it comes with are really nice and very artistic. It even comes with transferable fluid so you can even transfer your own art onto your skin. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Does not come out a brown-like color like regular Henna. Comes out as a blueish color. Stains for a long time and after apply dries quickly after applying, so if you mess up and wipe it off it will still appear on your skin your mistakes. So be careful, overall good product but not for me.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give half stars as this item was &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; perfect.  Of the five sheets of stencils, one was a duplicate, and I found most of the designs rather large.  That said I researched before hand how easy it was to make your own stencils with copy paper / ballpoint pen - and then use clear deoderant to transfer (I used Arm &amp; Hammer Naturals &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; which is a clear stick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else was as expected and easier to work with than I thought.  I love that there are 4 tips.  You can see the frog stencil in the picture - did that on my inner forearm.  Pale skinned.  Used the second to smallest tip. Left it on for an hour to dry and then another three hours.  Was already well-darkened by the time I removed (some people say to peel off, I did it by directions and washed off with warm soapy water) and a really nice black by the next morning.  I found a place I must have accidently touched on my arm despite my care - maybe in the future consider taping off the area around the design with painters/surgical tape?  Dunno.  I&#x27;ll probably just try to be careful again :-)  Also missed a place where the stencil looked dark and didn&#x27;t realize I hadn&#x27;t darkened over.  That can be touched up though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think this worked as a great beginners kit and intro to Jagua.  The stencil oil is a eucaplytus oil - smells nice.</li>
    <li> Did not really like this item. It smeared and left big blue spots on my skin and clothing</li>
    <li> I literally just got finish doing my tattoo and this product is awesome. Everything you need is included in the packaging, nothing is missing. There&#x27;s no mixing needed, the ink comes ready to use. There&#x27;s even a different size tips for adding extra detail, which I love. I bought the Earth Jagua tattoo kit and this one is better simply because there is no need for mixing together ingredients and it comes with more tips. The information in the little pamphlet is really useful as well. My first time ever doing a temporary tattoo (was with the Earth Jagua)  I completed my tattoo, washed it off and everything. Went to sleep and woke up with the tattoo transferred onto my face:) The pamphlet included with this product warns against that 😀</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different jagua products and this one is definitely my favorite! I purchased this one since money was tight so the price is great too, lowest one I found! It comes with lots of cute stencils and twice as much gel as other typical kits. I LOVE that it comes with different tips! From very fine for intricate work and large flr filling things in. The gel comes premixed which I also love and is very smooth and easy to use. I definitely reccommend this and will be ordering this regularly as I need to restock my jagua gel! Five stars!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter really liked this kit.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well it darkened just like they said it would. Though it does look like the ink was runny once it dried. I still love this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. lasts over 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;somewhat messy, but easy to apply</li>
    <li> The box smells funny that&#x27;s was probably my only . Other than that its in good shape everything came in. The paint and the little pencil things. and everything else</li>
    <li> This kit has very pretty, almost sensuous packaging but it doesn&#x27;t give you extra artistic ability or a patient temperament. If you already have them it does give you most everything else you&#x27;ll need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think carefully about what you want and where you want it, as there&#x27;s no going back until the design wears off again. Don&#x27;t attempt a design beyond your skills, even if it&#x27;s only one of the basic transfer designs supplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to have seen far more comprehensive guidance on which of the ink dispensing points to use and how to use them best, and what to do with the pointy stick which, though it is only a pointy stick and therefore limited in potential purposes, still has no instructions. The transfers are mainly basic and rather unimpressive, and might have included a few more sophisticated ones. Time and effort clearly went into presenting the naked woman on the box, but a bit more on the practical uses of the product would have been nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fair starter kit and will let you get it wrong fairly cheaply. If you want to do better, you&#x27;ll know whether you have the skill for it after giving this one a try.</li>
    <li> I have used henna several times but I was always a tad dissapointed because I could never get it very dark. The Jagua gel was nice and dark on my skin. The kit came with the four different sized tips and I loved them- it allowed for intricate designs. The only reason I would not give them five stars is due to the fact that the consistency of the Jagua gel is thin and that gave me much trouble as I worked with it. The product came earlier than expected- awesome... and I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Awesome color, stains very well, stays on as long as you apply it properly.</li>
    <li> More of a blue black color then Henna its like a black tattoo</li>
    <li> Works great love this stuff. Will order more! Was surprisingly please with this product. I hadn&#x27;t used anything like it before.</li>
    <li> its kinda hard to draw on yourself , but other thn that its pretty good, the stencils it comes with are all for chicks, and if u really want a dark black tattoo you have to do it in like 2 days with over fill ins,</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail today, and I LOVE it. It comes with a descent amount of jagua gel and the tattoos it comes with are fantastic. I just wish I had enough gel to do them all. 😎</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Comes in a cute bag. Instructions are included. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and like it very much. I was worried the ink would run out quickly and I would only get one use out of it. I am still not out of my first bottle and I have done 7 tattoos. The stencils are really nice and they transfer easily. It stays for a couple weeks and darkens over night. I am very satisfied with this product and recommend getting it.</li>
    <li> The tip or nozzle that&#x27;s supposed to be applied to the tube DOESNT FIT... Thereby preventing me from using the product. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this product because it is the perfect way to decide whether or not you want a tattoo or where to put it.  I think the kit could use some more designs though.  The first one I used smeared all over, but the others worked fine so far.  I will definitely buy this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent combination for a product.i recomend purchase of larger size oz. I will purchase this product again.nice to give as a gift.all needed is included in this kit.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and fun for a group.  I expires in about a month so you have to order it when you need it, but, it was a fun party entertainment.</li>
    <li> Hard to work with, texture is very cake like. Henna didn&#x27;t last long, maybe 5 days despite the fact that I left it on all night before washing.</li>
    <li> It did what it was supposed to it did a good job and it lasted a while.</li>
    <li> The product looks exactly as the photo depicts it - the packaging was sleek and professional. I haven&#x27;t tried the actual product, yet. However, if it works as well as their service, I will be above and beyond satisfied. Amazon told me that I wouldn&#x27;t receive my package for at least another week and here it is, a week early. Definitely saved me, because it is a gift for a friend and if they hadn&#x27;t had such good shipping, my gift would be late.</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars. It comes with everything in the product description. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting were the stencil designs. All they really were, were some simple tattoos printed on computer paper. This didn&#x27;t bother me at all because I already had a design in mind. Make sure you put the ink in the fridge right away, this made the ink that much more potent and allowed for the tattoo to look sharper and last longer. I&#x27;ve tried Henna, and I&#x27;ve tried Jagua, and I must say that I am very pleased with the Jagua results.</li>
    <li> Love it everyone thinks it&#x27;s a real tattoo!!</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it.  It lasted long enough for her to have options.</li>
    <li> First time I used Jagua tattoo products I was really impressed.  I used another brand the first time and thought I would try Henna City&#x27;s to compare, due to all the great reviews.  I must agree that Henna City tattoo kit was very impressive.  It came with plenty of tips to spread the ink and plenty of stencils if not adventuring free hand.  The ink applied dark, but I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity because I just apply it a few days ago.  So far, I like this product better than the other brand I tried the first time around.</li>
    <li> The ink is a much better quality than we have purchased in the past. Also more convenient that it comes premixed. The interchangeable nozzles are very handy for different types of art. Also, during the drying process the ink moved with the skin and stayed on, unlike other brands that can crack and fall off if moved. Will buy this set from this seller from now on. Not only is the ink top quality, but the seller was good. Received the set quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> This product arrived very quickly. The product enclosure states if a person has known allergies or taking any prescription meds do not use this product. This product did not work well for me. The first attempt the &amp;#34;paper&amp;#34; stencil ripped in half when tryin to press and apply to skin to form a tattoo. The 2nd attempt the tattoo never appeared on my skin.  Applying the stencil transfer solution was of no help. This is not henna. After today I will discard the rest and will be purchasing some henna which is much cheaper than this product but works 10 times better.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it.  A lot of fun!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but the product isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
    <li> Everything was good with my delivery</li>
    <li> better than henna and lasts longer too</li>
    <li> Love this! Did a few designs on my hands and everyone was complimenting it. Lasted for about a week. People loved my designs so much that they asked to do theirs...and i was able to do quite a few whole hand designs with the 1oz package. Great product. Will def be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Was confused with the directions at first about transferring the designs but figured it out. I was happy you can re-use the designs a few times also and the gel goes along way for a little bottle. They seemed to fade faster than I thought, so maybe leaving them on longer than directed might help that...and the kit would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I love it very easy instructions!!! Beautiful designs and  next week I am placing an order for more !!</li>
    <li> I love how dark the tattoo&#x27;s turn out, but just like the directions say any little mess up will SHOW! Even if you wipe it off right away, it shows up the next day, so make sure you know EXACTLY what you want and where. The image also lasted for almost 2 weeks, and stayed near black the duration.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my 18 year old daughter, she wanted it.The color was fairly dark and the product was easy to use. She lost interest in it quickly though and only used it once.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff and will never make the old henna again. The tubes last a long long time. And the art work lasts a long time on the body. FYI.... don&#x27;t shave the area you are about to tattoo right before doing it. The skin on my arm did NOT like it and I had a reaction. I suggest shaving the area the day before. But it may just be me &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Amazing works perfect and everyone believed it was real</li>
    <li> The product seems good. I have only used it once thus far. I don&#x27;t like the way some parts are faded and some parts are darker, but probably speaks more to my ability to apply it than anything else. I thought about touching it up, but don&#x27;t want to have parts still there days after the main part fades.</li>
    <li> A fun kit, it had way more henna then I needed even after multiple applications.  My daughters and I had fun making designs</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t stain the skin as advertised.  I tried it and the result was a very, very faint shaddow.  We left the gel on the skin for about 4 hours and then my wife showered, and the image was gone.  If you did not know what you were looking for; nobody would notice the &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34;.  The pictures they show of the product is when the juice is on the skin - it looks very dark and well defined.  But it is completely superficial, and when you wash the juice off no mark remains on the skin.  It&#x27;s garbage.  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Stays for a long time, I like it.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible! It swears and takes weeks to come off!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It came out nice and dark....definitely purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this product but it starts to give you a rash and bubbles up your skin like it&#x27;s swollen when u apply the product ! Kinda weird but it stains well and last a week or so not really 14 days</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to traditional brown henna. The reason i chose this product was because i wanted a temporary tattoo that looked as real as possible. Although the fully developed stain is not jet black it is pretty close, just as described. The only downside is that it has to be refrigerated between uses to stay good, but its worth it! This jagua fruit product is all natural and completely PPD free! I used it on plenty of friends and myself and no one experienced an allergic reaction; everyone was satisfied. Good shipping time and a great price! ill</li>
    <li> Quick delivery!  Awesome products, works great!!!</li>
    <li> This tattoo colour does stain the skin for a few days. Alas the colour is a darkish blue not black. It won&#x27;t suit everyone but its a pretty good solution if you&#x27;re looking for a natural product that stains the skin.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected. I was under the assumption that it would stay on for a couple weeks. Didn&#x27;t even stay on a week!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  All the kids had fun with this.  The designs on transfer paper worked great.</li>
    <li> This kit worked great, was easy to use, and made more tattoos than I thought it would.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as dark as I thought it&#x27;d be, also I thought it was real henna, but it&#x27;s not but it&#x27;s pretty close! I like it! It&#x27;s not to bad</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s the perfect size to try it &amp; has everything you need!! This was the first time I tried anything like this &amp; I love it!! I was thinking about getting another tattoo on my wrist so I bought this instead (for now) to try it out on my wrist!!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love it . It is so easy to do and the designs are awesome and 1oz is a lot. I completed my whole foot and five other designs and still have a bottle left</li>
    <li> Love this product! It stains very well and lasts up to 2-3 weeks. I used it on all of my family and still have way more than enough to spare. I&#x27;m about to do a design now (after pictures uploaded) since my last one has faded already (lasted 2 weeks, longer on some of my family). It leaves a dark greenish blue colour and the colour deepens to an almost black shade if used in conjunction with the stencils. I&#x27;m very glad I found this because I was looking for something that would last on my skin and was safe. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again in the future when I run out.</li>
    <li> Lots of fun and lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> Really good, does what it says but ... Be careful it gets messy easily</li>
</ol>
