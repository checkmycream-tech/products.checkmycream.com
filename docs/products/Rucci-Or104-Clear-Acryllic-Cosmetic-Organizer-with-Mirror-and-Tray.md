      <li>I liked this product a lot.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice product and holds quite a bit</li>
      <li>It makes my vanity/dresser look a lot more organized.</li>
      <li>I love having all of my supplies in one area.</li>
      <li>Cute</li>
      <li>but so is she  : )</li>
      <li>Put my necessary makeup in the draws... make up brushes up top... perfect for organizing your make up vanity.  </li>
      <li>You can fit a mascara, and lose all this valuable desk space.</li>
      <li>The reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because I would have liked to have 1 or 2 extra drawers.  </li>
      <li>I decided to just glue it back together, because why stress not being able to return it?</li>
      <li>Love this, it just seems like it is a bit smaller than I would have thought.</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves this</li>
      <li>Really the drawer is separate that you just place the rest onto if you want it to look like the picture.  </li>
      <li>But its nice to store everyday cosmetics I use.</li>
      <li>It works good for your makeup, I just wish that it would of been a little bigger</li>
      <li>Good thick pastic great for my brushes and pencils mirror is at an odd angle and behind stuff</li>
      <li>The issue with that was the drawer can be a little resistant to get open which causes the top section to move around.  </li>
      <li>The angle of the mirror doesn&#x27;t really work for us because with my wife&#x27;s seating position she can&#x27;t see herself in the mirror unless she moves the entire unit directly in front of her.  </li>
      <li>I really thought this was bigger.</li>
      <li>My grand daughter loves this - it&#x27;s very small</li>

      <li>All compartments are a little small but it looks pretty sitting on top.</li>
      <li>and I simply did not figure out how big it really was.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice tray for your lipsticks and a drawer for eyeshadows or a few pieces of small jewlery.</li>
      <li>The whole thing is so delicate that you really cannot use it day in and day out.  </li>
      <li>It cost too much for such a little organizer.</li>

    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it was, but it still holds all of my everyday makeup. It makes my vanity/dresser look a lot more organized.</li>
    <li> I got it for my daughters vanity.  All compartments are a little small but it looks pretty sitting on top.</li>
    <li> The size is really quite small.  Smaller than I thought it would be.

    <li> Delivered timely. Good thick pastic great for my brushes and pencils mirror is at an odd angle and behind stuff I never use it</li>
    <li> Put my necessary makeup in the draws... make up brushes up top... perfect for organizing your make up vanity.  &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> My grand daughter loves this - it&#x27;s very small but so is she  : )</li>
    <li> Thought it would be larger than what it looked like but thats the only dissapointment. It is a nice tray for your lipsticks and a drawer for eyeshadows or a few pieces of small jewlery.</li>
    <li> Yea, these aren&#x27;t great. At all. They&#x27;re flimsy, and ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re just bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also they&#x27;re small. You can fit a mascara, and lose all this valuable desk space.</li>
    <li> Its way to smaller than I expected.  The whole thing is so delicate that you really cannot use it day in and day out.  I was not very happy with it.</li>
    <li> it is very small, smaller than I expected. its for a baby collection of make up.</li>
    <li> So tiny. It cost too much for such a little organizer. I thought it was a lot bigger for the price.</li>
    <li> Just not practical for any storage purposes. Cute but that&#x27;s about it. Terrible design because the drawer is not attached so the whole unit moves around causing my items to fall everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product and holds quite a bit but it is much smaller than I thought it would be, which was disappointing for the price.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a good way to keep my wife&#x27;s clutter to a minimum. The item is actually very small and only holds a few things.</li>
    <li> I liked this product a lot.  The reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because I would have liked to have 1 or 2 extra drawers.  My make up is finally organized on my pantry and it is still decorative (if you like the lived in type of decor).</li>
    <li> The item was very nice just not what I was looking for. It was a lot smaller than I was expecting and especially for the price it would not even hold my powder in the drawer</li>
    <li> I really thought this was bigger. when I got it it&#x27;s smaller than a shoebox. wife was like playing tetris when trying to put everything in</li>
    <li> Very small holds very little</li>
    <li> Love this, it just seems like it is a bit smaller than I would have thought. But it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> I choose this for my daughter because she wheres makeup and needed a place to put it.  She received this for Christmas.  She absolutely loves this and I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be bigger but no, it&#x27;s too small for the price. It works good for your makeup, I just wish that it would of been a little bigger</li>
    <li> I brought this for my wife. I read the reviews after I picked it out. When I got the box after pulling it out of the mailbox. My wife loved it. I thought it was to small. But she loved it. Just be careful of the size when ordering  yours.</li>
    <li> It was a little smaller that I expected, but I had not read the measurement information.  I love having all of my supplies in one area.</li>
    <li> I received this product today, and i have to say I was disappointed. When opened the package the organized was alot smaller than expected. Also the corner of the drawer compartment was completely broken off. I tried completing the return survey, but at the end it didnt let me. I decided to just glue it back together, because why stress not being able to return it? Its whatever. But I wont be buying anything else from Amazon for a while. Besides the flaws i actually do like it. Doesnt hold alot. But its nice to store everyday cosmetics I use.</li>
