      <li>LifeVantage TrueScience Antiaging Cream  was OK but keep in mind</li>
      <li>I love lifeVantage anti aging cream.  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>, I love it a lot .</li>
      <li>but I am so glad I took the chance and bought it.</li>
      <li>More than just an anti-aging cream for sure.</li>
      <li>I am so glad it works for anyone else ..</li>
      <li>I love the products.  </li>

      <li>Produces selling for alot more.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Need I say more.</li>
      <li>This cream is light and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>I love True Science, and would be greatly pleased if they came out with a body lotion.  </li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves your skin soft</li>
      <li>I am not a distributor nor do I have any interest in becoming one.</li>
      <li>Have had that keloid scar for over a year before I started using Protandim and True Science, and now the raised, keloid is gone!  </li>
      <li>BUT that isn&#x27;t the best part, it leaves my face so soft, has no greasy feeling at all, the texture of my face is absolutely smoother than it has been in decades....</li>
      <li>One thing that I have not  notice yet, is the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Helps hydrate, get rid of fine lines, is hypnoallergenic and anti aging.</li>
      <li>Fine lines on forehead softened and diminished.  </li>
      <li>and the pump worked fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking out for the real distributors who sell it at a MUCH BETTER PRICE!  </li>
      <li>My skin is radiant and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Feels great going on and my skin looks younger and healthier.  </li>
      <li>My complexion is far superior than 40 years ago</li>
      <li>Apparently if you receive these as a gift, they are as good as garbage</li>
      <li>I originally began using TrueScience when my husband was going through radiation treatements and had severe burns on his neck.  </li>
      <li>But if this story sounds familiar to you, this cream may be the answer to your prayers.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic and smooths on and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>cream is pleasant to use; it absorbs instantly into skin leaving no oily feeling or residue.</li>
      <li>The texture is light and readily absorbed.  </li>
      <li>Finally I found good deal here</li>
      <li>But the containers don&#x27;t hold that much creme- more container than product.</li>
      <li>It feels silky smooth on your skin, not at all oily and is being absorbed immediately.&lt;br</li>
      <li>tried True Science cream after someone gave me a sample, fully expecting a breakout.</li>
      <li>Thanks LifeVantage for such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They have apparently come up with some kind of suction system and it works</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;sit\\&quot; on your skin, and absorbs quickly so you can apply makeup right away.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only did I not break out after using it, I have experienced a complete cessation of acne breakouts!  </li>
      <li>so much smoother and softer, fine lines diminished.</li>
      <li>However, when I cleanse my face after a shower and apply the truescience, it simply feels amazing.</li>
      <li>I have been using this amazing moisturizer for about 3 months, yes, the same bottle for 3 months</li>
      <li>Worth every penny of the cost.</li>
      <li>To be clear: I am putting this cream on the most oily and acne prone areas of my face; nose chin and forehead.</li>
      <li>It was cheaper than buying from their own website but the shipping was around $16 for  2 bottles and the envelope showed the actual shipping price as around $5</li>
      <li>I liked it well enough to buy it on auto-ordering.  </li>
      <li>I am simply someone who was introduced to this product and feel very strongly about</li>
      <li>I really feel you have to use the combination in order to get the full results.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am just not sure if this one is real. The last time I bought this cream was when it was I guess what was called the old formula. The bottle was smaller and darker blue. The pump was different. That stuff was great my face was firm my complexion was even and it got rid of my acne. Back then there wasn&#x27;t a four step process. I don&#x27;t know if this stuff is just not real, Or if the new formula is different meaning worse than the old formula, but this stuff did not have the same results as the other stuff I had used in the past.</li>
    <li> This product not coming from a dermatologists recommendation is the best thing I have ever used on my skin. My skin does not have that rough texture any more and I don&#x27;t use an exfoliant. Don&#x27;t have to anymore.</li>
    <li> SImply Wonderful!!! My Mother and Friends Swear by this cream and only use this TrueSicence Antiaging Cream. Half of her friends stopped using makeup because of the benefits they received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found more info of all products:  [...]</li>
    <li> Since I just got this cream, I am suspending any idea that it&#x27;s good or bad.  I bought it for&lt;br /&gt;my hands ...so I may change the three stars to one or five later.  I don&#x27;t know yet.  I do know&lt;br /&gt;that it&#x27;s not greasy and it smells good.  So, thus far - three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay!  I&#x27;ve used all of it and it&#x27;s not good at all.  The majority of the people raving about it&lt;br /&gt;surely must work for the company.  It does not do anything that dime store cream won&#x27;t do.  It&lt;br /&gt;does smell citrus-y and nice, but it didn&#x27;t do anything at all to help my skin and there was&lt;br /&gt;very little product for the price.  Don&#x27;t let the bottle fool you.  And for those of you who&lt;br /&gt;rate my review down because you work for the company: you&#x27;re a SHILL.</li>
    <li> I am so glad it works for anyone else .. I tried this cream.. now I developed perioral dermatitis ... Omg .. I wish I never put this cream on my sensitive skin. I thought it would go away if I didn&#x27;t stop using it .. but now I have wounds type of irritation around my mouth and it&#x27;s so painful!  And it burns so bad when I apply this cream... I guess everyone is different and my skin doesn&#x27;t like something inside this cream.. can&#x27;t use this .. now I have to somehow heal my rash/wounds .. called lifevantage, no one has answers for me.</li>
    <li> This antiaging cream is not heavy like other creams at all. It&#x27;s a very light lotion.  My face will have little red bumps all over if I&#x27;m allergic, and my eyes will sting,  but this cream doesn&#x27;t do that to me. It also gave me a nice glow on my face.  I&#x27;m 45 years old with pale, yellow under skin tone. One thing that I have not  notice yet, is the fine lines and wrinkles. And I don&#x27;t like the smell  of this on my face but it&#x27;s bearable. It&#x27;s smell like a mixtures of fruits and candies.  I&#x27;m getting old, and don&#x27;t like any candy smell on my face. But I will finish the bottle  and see if there is any further results!</li>
    <li> For me it was a waste of money.  I have not noticed any change in my skin and the cream smells bad.</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with Protandim Anti-Aging Supplement for one month. Fine lines on forehead softened and diminished.  Acne and other skin problems resolving.  Will definitely repurchase both. Product arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  However the pump does not work.  Opened it up and there wasn&#x27;t a tube connected.  Thinking it had come loose I used tweezers to try and get the tube out.  There wasn&#x27;t a tube in it. The cream is thick so very hard to get out of bottle. Not sure how to have them send me a new pump.</li>
    <li> I have been using this amazing moisturizer for about 3 months, yes, the same bottle for 3 months and I still have some in it. Even though you may think it&#x27;s a little pricey, it takes just a tiny drop and that one drop can cover your face and neck, so it really goes a long way. BUT that isn&#x27;t the best part, it leaves my face so soft, has no greasy feeling at all, the texture of my face is absolutely smoother than it has been in decades....I&#x27;m 47.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and was hesitant to switch but I am so glad I took the chance and bought it. I am also using their Protandim supplement, that&#x27;s also another terrific product and one I won&#x27;t be without.&lt;br /&gt;If you just look past the cost of the moisturizer and see how beneficial it can be for your complexion I promise you will only use this. There is another big plus too....you don&#x27;t need to purchase a separate under eye cream, because this will take care of that sensitive part too! Don&#x27;t wait another day, order yourself some and see for yourself. BTW I am not a product consultant or anything like that I am simply someone who was introduced to this product and feel very strongly about it&#x27;s effectiveness...it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 34yo male, I have not used this consistently twice a day for the anti-aging benefits so I cannot speak to the effects of that, nor give it a 5th star for that reason. However, when I cleanse my face after a shower and apply the truescience, it simply feels amazing. The most perfect fragrance I&#x27;ve ever smelled and my face feels completely hydrated. I&#x27;m not a connoisseur, I don&#x27;t have expertise with other products. All I can say is I&#x27;m such a fan of this product that I have no interest in shopping the market for something similar or less expensive.  I am not a distributor nor do I have any interest in becoming one.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream about a month ago and I do believe brown spots are lightening for sure. My face feels really nice and going to use on some problem areas due to sun in other areas. Give a try you will like!!!</li>
    <li> product arrived on time,but the straw in side that is soposed to be attached to dispencer pump is missing?? expensive item/difficult to get out of bottle[[ASIN:B003WKWE90 LifeVantage TrueScience Antiaging Cream]]</li>
    <li> Disclaimer:  I&#x27;m not a distributor and not a paid reviewer for this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 61 yr old woman who has fought with oily skin and break-outs since adolescence. I have been unable to use any moisturizers or creams for aging skin without having immediate breakouts of acne. I take meticulous care of my skin and have tried EVERYTHING for these problems. My dermatologist is at a loss for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;I tried True Science cream after someone gave me a sample, fully expecting a breakout. After a month of use, it isn&#x27;t an exaggeration to say this product is a miracle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did I not break out after using it, I have experienced a complete cessation of acne breakouts!  Yes I know that isn&#x27;t what it&#x27;s marketed for, what else can I say?  It works!  I use it on my entire face including under my eyes.  Dark circles and lines under eyes are much improved (better results than previous eye creams).  Overall my face is so much smoother and softer, fine lines diminished. Pore size reduced.  To be clear: I am putting this cream on the most oily and acne prone areas of my face; nose chin and forehead. It&#x27;s  making them LESS oily and no breakouts.  The oily areas are less oily; the dry areas are less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is pleasant to use; it absorbs instantly into skin leaving no oily feeling or residue. I don&#x27;t notice a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s another crazy bonus. I have dry fingernails and cuticles, despite constant use of lotions and creams. The fingers I used to apply the lotion began to feel so much softer, the skin looked shiny and fresh; the nails much less dry. So I have begun using a small amount on my finger tips each night. My skin and nails are much improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a skeptic, God bless you, I understand. But if this story sounds familiar to you, this cream may be the answer to your prayers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using True Science for a few months now and I am very pleased.  I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and while I have fewer wrinkles than most of my friends 5-10 years younger than me, fine lines have started, and True Science has definitely improved my skin.  This stuff works!  I think it would have been even better to have started using True Science when I was younger (although it didn&#x27;t exist when I was in my 30&#x27;s) to nip the beginning wrinkles in the bud even earlier.  So I believe this is a great opportunity for women (and men if they choose) are who younger than I am to start using the product to slow down the aging process on their face, neck, and chest area.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my hands and can tell an improvement there too in texture.  Sidenote: I had a medical procedure done where they put tubing in a vein in my chest (it was called a catheter, I think it must be like a port?).  When they removed the tubing weeks later I developed a keloid scar there. Have had that keloid scar for over a year before I started using Protandim and True Science, and now the raised, keloid is gone!  Yes, you can still see a small scar, but its not a raised bump any more.  Makes me feel so much better!  I love True Science, and would be greatly pleased if they came out with a body lotion.  (hint, hint, LifeVantage)</li>
    <li> Been using it for years and love it!  Helps hydrate, get rid of fine lines, is hypnoallergenic and anti aging.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream.  I wear it both day and night.  Its not greasy or oily and other makeup goes on smoothly over it.  I have old, dry skin with age spots, and this product really helps.</li>
    <li> A buddy of mine is a distributor for this company and I purchased this along with the protandim to give it a shot.  I don&#x27;t have many deep lines or wrinkles but have been noticing creases beginning to form on my forehead and around my eyes.  I&#x27;m 31 and have been using it for about a month now and I absolutely can see a difference in the way my skin looks.  I use it in the morning and again before bed and the lines that were forming have diminished a noticeable amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to write this because I was having dinner with my wife last night at a restaurant and she just stopped in the middle of conversation and said \\&quot;your skin looks amazing.\\&quot;  Needless to say that is not a compliment I get much as a man and it was really nice to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of comments here griping about \\&quot;price\\&quot; but at the end of the day - one gets what one pays for.  The skin on your face is the most important real estate on your body and it would be silly to not protect it.  I will continue to use and buy this product.</li>
    <li> Beware of where you are buying your products.  I love the products.  I do not like how they are being sold on Amazon against the company&#x27;s policy.    \\&quot;LifeVantage recently initiated a legal action against a distributor who it believes was involved in a scheme to sell the company’s product through unauthorized websites, including Amazon.com.  An internal investigation led by the compliance team indicated that this distributor, and possibly others, was responsible for a large amount of product being sold on Amazon.com.  An internal investigation will continue in order to determine if other distributors were also involved in the scheme.  The compliance team believes that efforts in this regard are essential to maintaining a level playing field for all distributors.\\&quot;    [...]</li>
    <li> I love lifeVantage anti aging cream.  It really makes my face feel soft and my face glows!  Others come up to me and ask what I did and I just keep my secret of using this product.  It works!</li>
    <li> I have been using the whole set, the cleanser, toner, eye cream and then face cream for a few weeks now. I stopped for a week because i wasn&#x27;t sure if i felt a difference . After a week of stopping the process i decided to try it again and i couldnt be happier , i dont use anything else any more on my skin and my skin looks amazing. I really feel you have to use the combination in order to get the full results.  I have placed my Dior skin care aside for now and i am going to continue the TrueScience i have had several compliments and my wrinkles are diminishing i ordered thru a distributor .</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other reviees  and It appears to be working quite well…I am on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I Love this cream!. Makes my face feel smooth and soft and it helps with getting rid of brown spots on the face. have seen a big improvement of my skin since I have been using this product.</li>
    <li> Great product feel good to the skin smells good and it really works we&#x27;ll.......  Would recommend to all.  Buy buy</li>
    <li> So Far I think my face is looking younger after 3 months  of using this.</li>
    <li> I received my order on time but the pump does not work on the bottle.  I am unable to use the cream.  I feel I have lost $85 and nothing to show for it and no recourse!  Last time that will happen!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!  The only drawback is they don&#x27;t make it with an SPF.  Therefore, I have to use an additional product to protect my skin in the day time. Why they don&#x27;t incorporate SPF in an anti-aging cream is beyond me!  I have suggested this to the company and am waiting to see if they follow my good advice.  Let&#x27;s add some prevention to the marketing, people will appreciate it!  Despite this one negative all else is really outstanding with this product!</li>
    <li> This product is a complete scam!  I received 2 bottles from a family member as a gift.  I do not wish to use this product and proceeded to post these bottles on Ebay to get rid of them.  The Lifevantage company had my listings pulled claiming false product.  These were 2 new bottles with the box NEVER opened.  I posted pictures of all sides of the box.  According to them, looking at pictures of their own product, they are claiming false product.  Apparently if you receive these as a gift, they are as good as garbage and you are not able to sell them.  Just wanted to warn everyone else.</li>
    <li> My husband has suffered with psoriasis all his life. He has tried everything that we could think of. I heard about this product and thought we would give it a try and he is finally getting that psoriasis under control. Even the stuff the doctor ordered did not work but this did.</li>
    <li> This product has an acidic order, it stings areas of my face.  I then researched this product further, finding there is reason to believe it works as claimed.  Junk.  LifeVantage is not to be trusted.</li>
    <li> I m looking for this stuff for long time . Finally I found good deal here , I love it a lot .</li>
    <li> LifeVantage TrueScience Antiaging Cream is a cream I have been using for several months.  It is the best of its kind&lt;br /&gt;that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I do like the product. It feels silky smooth on your skin, not at all oily and is being absorbed immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Is it really antiaging? I don&#x27;t know, but I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Whomever this seller is trying to sell the LifeVantage TrueScience  Antiaging cream is not premitted to do so and does not have authorization from the LifeVantage company.  There is no guarantee that this is the real product.  Go to the MyLifeVantage site to inquire about the real product.  And YES it works awesome!  I&#x27;m looking out for the real distributors who sell it at a MUCH BETTER PRICE!  You are getting ripped off here.</li>
    <li> I buy this from a dealer on automatic purchase so it doesn&#x27;t cost me this much.  I have a very evident age spot on my cheek where it&#x27;s obvious.  I&#x27;ve tried everything.  I use Protandim so tried this as well, I have lightened this spot to about 3/4 the darkness it was.  It&#x27;s not gone, but it&#x27;s so much less obvious.  I liked it well enough to buy it on auto-ordering.  I only use it on my face but twice a day and it still lasts a long time.  I can use 3 or 4 bottles at most per year.  It works well with my age spot when nothing else did.</li>
    <li> This cream is light and refreshing.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 months now and even I can notice the difference in texture and even tone of my face.  Works well with makeup primer.  Not heavy at all.  Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts...</li>
    <li> TrueScience cream is effective on wrinkles but I also discovered a couple of other uses for the cream. I had burned myself quite badly on two fingers when a blender wheel touched my hand - the pain was awful to say the least. I ran my hand under cold water for 10 min and it still hurt! I then applied TrueScience cream to my hand a couple of times before sleeping. When I awoke in the morning, all evidence of the burn (and blisters) were gone. A few days later my husband burned his hand on a frying pan and I had him do the same treatment - we were both amazed when there was no evidence of the burn the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using TrueScience to treat my fungus infection on my big toe - the infection is definitely being reduced (only 2 days into the treatment so far). Thanks LifeVantage for such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bette Daoust&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> love the cream! very light! only problem was the pump worked once and then would not work again.  I turned it upside down and stored it that way and the pump worked fine.  very nice cream not sure if it is worth $100 though in my opinion.</li>
    <li> LifeVantage TrueScience Antiaging Cream  was OK but keep in mind I’m a guy. This cream is a little on the expensive side for me so I do not plan on reordering.</li>
    <li> this cream really makes my face feel a lot smoother with consistent use!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this. Seller is very good.</li>
    <li> A friend who, like me, has pre-cancerous spots on her face, chest and arms was having amazing results with this product. After 3 weeks my spots were disappearing and within 6 weeks 4 were completely gone. I will not be without this now. It was cheaper than buying from their own website but the shipping was around $16 for  2 bottles and the envelope showed the actual shipping price as around $5 so they made up the price by over charging on the shipping. Not cool. LOVE the cream though!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s perfect under my day lotion and I use it alone at night. It smells fantastic and smooths on and absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s a little pricey but a bottle lasts me about a 1 1/2 months and would definitely last longer if I used one pump instead of two.</li>
    <li> WOW.  I&#x27;ve tried everything &amp; this stuff is unbelievable.  Produces selling for alot more.  I LOVE LifeVantage TrueScience Antiaging Cream!</li>
    <li> I am a part of lifevantage myself. This is an amazing product, however purchasing it through amazon rather than a distributor is illegal. An open market company like Amazon makes it difficult to remove these but I highly recommend finding a distributor. It&#x27;s legal and HALF THE PRICE THAT WAY!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the new formula, but thevSeller did refund me.</li>
    <li> love this moisturizer. works really well on 72 year old normal to dry skin.</li>
    <li> I am a distributor for this company and I see some of the people complaining that it won&#x27;t pump and they think the straws missing. I had the same problem when I first signed up with the company and I had to call them.  there is no straw inside the bottle Attached to the pump. Turn the bottle upside down and pump it while you&#x27;re holding the bottle upside down, It sometimes takes 10 or 15 pumps to get it pumping but you have to pump while holding the bottle upside down. once you get it pumping Then you can turn the bottle back up right. It will pump every last drop out of that bottle. They have apparently come up with some kind of suction system and it works but it&#x27;s sometimes hard to get it started. And yes they should give you some instructions that tell you how to get it started.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! It smells great and leaves your skin soft&lt;br /&gt;and with a healthy glow. I will use it forever!!</li>
    <li> I have been using for a year and feel my skin fresh and young. People don&#x27;t believe the age I am. I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels great after using this stuff for 2 months.  Lightweight enough for summer but still moisturizing.  Recently read Grain Brain by Dr.  and he confirms the claims of Life Vantage that their ingredients activate the Nrf2 pathways to get your body producing those all-important antioxidents we need to fight oxidative stress.  FIGHT IT ON YOUR FACE w/ this cream!</li>
    <li> This is a quality creme. It took care of a friends&#x27; &amp;#34; Farmers Hands&amp;#34; in two days. But the containers don&#x27;t hold that much creme- more container than product. So it ends up being pretty pricey. I continue to buy it, because it does work very well.</li>
    <li> I really like True Science Antiaging cream, I have been using it for over 2 years now and have not found anything else like it.</li>
    <li> For anyone with sensitive, aging skin, this product is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;sit\\&quot; on your skin, and absorbs quickly so you can apply makeup right away. I have extremely sensitive skin and cannot use high-end products with perfume. This is a  perfect product for me.</li>
    <li> No change in my skin at all after 30 days!  Spent to much money on something that doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
    <li> Excellent, smooth and make my skin much better, I would like prefer this wonderful cream to everyboby, you should try it !!!</li>
    <li> It is wonderful!!  Cost is a bit higher than I would usually pay, but I love it and will pay the price!?</li>
    <li> I love it!! Feels great going on and my skin looks younger and healthier.  Highly recommend it for daily skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Does nothing it claims. Dimestore moisturizers work just as well. Save your money. I listened to hype from a company distributor and now wish I had the money back in my pocket.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent! It has Dimethicon which is an ingredient involved in sealing the moisture in the skin. My discoloration is almost gone after using the product for 2 months.</li>
    <li> ordered this cream after i tried a sample sent in my protandim order. it is great light and emollient.&lt;br /&gt;makes my skin look glowing.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you NeosBios for prompt delivery of my product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to all it. My grandson has very dry skin, this product help to keep it moist and will also help with aging. Love it you only need a little an it goes along way will not leave your face grease like some moisture do.</li>
    <li> I have used this product and the protandim dietary supplement for eight years. Worth every penny of the cost. My complexion is far superior than 40 years ago and I have smoked for 50 years. People say I look 45 and I will be 67 in August!</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful cream that absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling nice and smooth. I&#x27;ve used many, many skin care products, and this one is great! I also have friends who have used it on age spots and skin cancer, and have have amazing results. More than just an anti-aging cream for sure. As an MLM company, I&#x27;m not sure that this is supposed to be sold on Amazon, but however if you get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I originally began using TrueScience when my husband was going through radiation treatements and had severe burns on his neck.  The creams he was given were not effective in healing those burns.  Finally, someone recommended True Science.  In desperation (after him suffering with these burns for 7 weeks) we ordered some and within 5 days from the inital application the burns were nearly healed. Sadly he passed away. There was some remaining in the bottle and I began using it around my eyes, it has dramatically changed the texture and appearance of the skin.</li>
    <li> Wow, I could really tell a difference after 4 weeks!  My shin is smoother and fine lines are less visible.  My skin is radiant and smooth.  My only complaint is that the BIG bottle only contains 1.5 ounces and it&#x27;s difficult to tell when running low until you&#x27;re actually out of product.</li>
    <li> GOOD, BUT EXPENSIVE SO HAVE TO USE ANOTHER PRODUCT. OTHER PRODUCTS&lt;br /&gt;BURN MY SKIN NOW. I FOUND ONE THAT WAS GOOD THEN THEY STOPPED MAKING&lt;br /&gt;IT SO I HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND IS&lt;br /&gt;AFFORDABLE.</li>
    <li> Buy from a Lifevantage authorized distributor. Different colored bottles, some saying bottle&#x27;s pump doesnt work. Buy the cream, stay clear of bad businesses.</li>
    <li> This cream is great but expensive!</li>
    <li> I am 52 years old. I look younger due to the True Science. Need I say more. I love it.</li>
    <li> My parents gave me a bottle for christmas and I thought nothing of it. Stashed it away with the rest of my lotions. My 4 month old son was having terrible eczema issues and I tried EVERYTHING I could think of to help. Changed diet, changed lotions, changed soaps. Literally tried everything. As a last resort I tried this and in 4 DAYS my sons skin was smoother and the rashes have almost disappeared. LOVE THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily to speed the healing of a stubborn rash - pitiraisis rosea - for which it has performed beautifully.  It even minimized the itch.  Since I had it, I used a bit on my face and neck.  Now, I&#x27;ll be 70 in February, so my wrinkles are pretty well set.  The wrinkles are definitely softening.  My husband says I look younger.  That&#x27;s just after a couple of weeks.  The texture is light and readily absorbed.  Think I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Delivered not only on time but ahead of schedule. I have been using this product for a long time.  The container appears to be smaller than previously ordered and does have an older dispenser.</li>
