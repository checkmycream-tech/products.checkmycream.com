<li> , I can apply a bit of this to the very ends as a leave-in conditioner to tame the dryness and the frizziness of my color-treated hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that my hair is fine, thin, dry, colored &amp; tends to frizz.</li>
<li> DOES NOT WORK FOR NORMAL OR DRY HAIR, PERIOD, END OF STORY!!!!!</li>
<li> While in my hair, my hair felt soft, yet a little oily.</li>
<li> I applied this product directly to my dry ends, then followed with a shampoo.  </li>
<li> Quality conditioner with no buildup, adds shine and doesn&#x27;t dry out scalp.  </li>
<li> I realized that even though the conditioner is costly, I end up using less than regular store brands so in the end</li>
<li> No, not really.</li>
<li> Buying products by reading other reviews...that is what I am doing.</li>
<li> But I never get the outcome like other users.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the conditioner, but either way I have been using the same brand of shampoo and they work well together.</li>
<li> This is a completely average conditioner.</li>
<li> My hair was severely damaged after a few dying mistakes - dry, brittle and dull with split ends galore.  </li>
<li> For the price I was a bit skeptical, but I decided to give it a try because of the rave reviews.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s outrageous price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My favorite &amp;#34;conditioner.&amp;#34;  Lightweight for my ultra fine hair and it works!</li>
    <li> This is a completely average conditioner. I was expecting much more given it&#x27;s outrageous price. I&#x27;m trying to figure out why people would pay this much.</li>
    <li> No different than Suave</li>
    <li> Very oily, can&#x27;t use this at all as a rinse out conditioner in the shower. If it gets anywhere near my scalp, I end up with a scalp breakout as well as oily-looking bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I&#x27;ve blown-dry my hair, I can apply a bit of this to the very ends as a leave-in conditioner to tame the dryness and the frizziness of my color-treated hair.  I will need to go back to purchasing Fekkai Technician Color Care Conditioner for use in the shower as a detangler so I can comb my hair out.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has been excellent. It is very smooth and creamy and a little can go a long way. For the price I was a bit skeptical, but I decided to give it a try because of the rave reviews. I realized that even though the conditioner is costly, I end up using less than regular store brands so in the end I save money. I have been using this conditioner for 4-5 months (washing every 2-3 days and I have shoulder length hair) and I still have 1/3rd of a bottle left. I&#x27;m very happy with how it makes my hair feel and it gives great volume. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the conditioner, but either way I have been using the same brand of shampoo and they work well together.</li>
    <li> but does it help so good???? No, not really. Buying products by reading other reviews...that is what I am doing. But I never get the outcome like other users. The stuff is good, but not it&#x27;s money worth. Regular priced items in any drug store can do the job!</li>
    <li> It smells nice and seems to do the job of shine pretty well.  If it didn&#x27;t cost so much, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> No buildup, smells great and worth the cost. Make sure to get the leave in creme, serum and shampoo for the full effect!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner. I am always getting compliments on my hair and how healthy and shiny it looks. Yes it is on the pricier side but it&#x27;s worth it. I have been using this line for years. I have tried many other brands and always go back to this one. If you are looking for volume you should go with their volumizing line as this one does not provide volume. A little goes a long way, it won&#x27;t feel like it at first but leave it in your hair for a bit and you will see. Amazing stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner at a great price</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine hair and live near the ocean... this does a great job keeping the frizzies and fly-aways at bay and protects it from the sun and salt water!</li>
    <li> love the Fekkai hair care products</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo and will continue to buy. PERFECT for fine hair. My hair looks healthier and is fuller. Product as described. Fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My hair was severely damaged after a few dying mistakes - dry, brittle and dull with split ends galore.  I applied this product directly to my dry ends, then followed with a shampoo.  I noticed a major difference in one use.  Ends are suddenly shiny and soft minus the fly-aways.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fekkai for awhile, really makes my hair feel amazing, I especially love the glossing the prx, after damaging my hair with heat tools and dyes this gives it that pretty shine it doesn&#x27;t get with anything else:)</li>
    <li> it smelled nice but didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference with my hair being really shiny like I was hoping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that my hair is fine, thin, dry, colored &amp; tends to frizz. The Brilliant Glossing Conditioner was thick &amp; had a pleasant smell to it. While in my hair, my hair felt soft, yet a little oily. Upon rinsing it out, my hair was soft &amp; silky. My hair was very moisturized, yet I couldn&#x27;t see any of the shiny gloss that it advertised. I would definitely consider purchasing it to use on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Amazing Shampoo!  Affordable and actually works!  I had enough for one use from an Influenster sample box and even then I saw a difference - definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK FOR NORMAL OR DRY HAIR, PERIOD, END OF STORY!!!!! If you have oily hair, it is okay.  EXPENSIVE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;WOULDN&#x27;T YOU THINK FOR THIS MONEY, IT WOULD WORK!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for years and it keeps my hair shiny and smooth without build-up.</li>
    <li> Quality conditioner with no buildup, adds shine and doesn&#x27;t dry out scalp.  I will purchase again soon.  Recommend this product.</li>
