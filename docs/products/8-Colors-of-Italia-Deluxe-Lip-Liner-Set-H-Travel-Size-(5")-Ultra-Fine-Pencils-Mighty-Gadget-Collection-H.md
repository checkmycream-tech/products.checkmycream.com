      <li>Lovely.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>Great colors all very natural shades.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve notice with a brush you will be able to see the stokes, but if using with your finger they work fine</li>
      <li>Professional quality,  great colors.  </li>
      <li>Love the range of colors but they are not as smooth as advertised.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and stays on.</li>
      <li>Many colors make the choices fun.</li>
      <li>They go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>MAC pencils are slightly bigger and more creamier than these, but 8 pencils for $11 that&#x27;s 80% close to MAC is still amazing.</li>
      <li>The colors go on so smooth and it&#x27;s a great combination of colors to fit your everyday looks and needs.</li>
      <li>I love the lipliner so much</li>
      <li>I absolutely loved these, goes smooth and last a right amount of time.</li>
      <li>but they arrived really quickly.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the product on my lip yet, but I sampled it on my hand and they&#x27;re very smooth to put on, and the consistency of it is very creamy (which is what I was exactly looking for).</li>
      <li>I use them as matte lipstick and they&#x27;re really creamy and easy to handle.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping too!</li>
      <li>I got exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Just make sure your lips are moisturized and exfoliated prior to use!</li>
      <li>Love them, the last forever!</li>
      <li>This set of lipliners is exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.  </li>
      <li>They really bring out my lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I really wish I didn&#x27;t have to sharpen then though.</li>
      <li>then the 15 dollar lip linear that I usually buy which is amazing</li>
      <li>Did not receive the colors listed which is WHY I ordered this particular selection.  </li>
      <li>Seem high quality.</li>
      <li>However, most of the colors were very dark.  </li>
      <li>I like the purse friendly size, and the liners are thin, go on smoothly and stay on.  </li>
      <li>I love theses colors, especially the neutral shade, I took away one star because  instead of 8 different ones I got 6 different shades, two colors were repeated.</li>
      <li>These tended to be more pink than I had expected</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced and my only complaint is it wipes off a tad to easily.</li>
      <li>The colors are pretty true to the caps, a little dark for me</li>
      <li>so my lips need a lot of pigment but a natural shade is key!  </li>
      <li>I use sparingly, at the beginning of the day then lipgloss to tone it down, and it really has staying power.</li>
      <li>The lip liners come are a completely different colour in real life and are extremely dark.</li>

<li> Not especially good or bad.</li>

    <li> Love the colors and good quality -thalia</li>
    <li> Did not receive the colors listed which is WHY I ordered this particular selection.  It&#x27;s not worth my returning this product.  However, all but one or two of the colors are going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did, however, note that the texture is quite nice and goes on very smoothly.  I would recommend the product, but not the company.</li>

    <li> These lip liner feel like great quality for the price. The colors are pretty true to the caps, a little dark for me but I still have it a shot. I can utilize them by mixing with lipstick or gloss. You really can&#x27;t loose they are very nice.</li>
    <li> Great variety of colors</li>
    <li> it is a nice lip liner!! stays long at my lips but I don&#x27;t like the shade except nutmeg shade.</li>
    <li> There good. Prob only use 4 colors outta the bunch, but daughter will use others</li>
    <li> Great variety of colors for reasonable prices</li>
    <li> Pleased with these.I got exactly what I needed.They go on smoothly.The colors are nice for any skin tone.I really wish I didn&#x27;t have to sharpen then though.Not the sellers but they arrived really quickly.Update:Just discovered I have 2 of the same color.Not sure of it was purposely or by accident.</li>
    <li> I love the lipliner so much</li>

I haven&#x27;t tried the product on my lip yet, but I sampled it on my hand and they&#x27;re very smooth to put on, and the consistency of it is very creamy (which is what I was exactly looking for). It sucks for the people who are spending $16 on a MAC pencil. MAC pencils are slightly bigger and more creamier than these, but 8 pencils for $11 that&#x27;s 80% close to MAC is still amazing. I would never spend another dollar on any MAC lip liners.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, definetly recommend and the price makes it that much better. Super fast shipping too!</li>

    <li> Theoretically all but two should be way too dark for my Norweigian/Irish skin tone, but all but one actually work.  Two I use constantly, and three I use sparingly, at the beginning of the day then lipgloss to tone it down, and it really has staying power. I am 50 so my lips need a lot of pigment but a natural shade is key!  These would be perfect for African-American or darker skin tones, I would imagine.  ANd they glide on better than my VERY expensive attempts at other well-known brands.</li>
    <li> Creamy and came in good conditions.</li>
    <li> This set of lipliners is exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for.  There are four brownish shades, all different, a couple of reds, and a couple of neutrals.  I like the purse friendly size, and the liners are thin, go on smoothly and stay on.  For the price, this set is a steal!</li>
    <li> Love these. The colors go on so smooth and it&#x27;s a great combination of colors to fit your everyday looks and needs.</li>
    <li> Great colors all very natural shades. Seem high quality. Great price too.</li>
    <li> They are slightly dark</li>
    <li> Love the way it goes on and when I tried to wash it off, it was a fight! Love it! It will definately hold up against napkins, cups, and kisses.</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with my purchase of lip liner set.  Color choices are varied which is a plus for those who use different colors of lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. They show up very brightly!!! Love stay too!!</li>
    <li> It glides on easy and the colors are great.</li>
    <li> I like the quality of these liners.  However, most of the colors were very dark.  I can use them during the winter but not summer.  The quality is really good.</li>

    <li> Good buy...applicates and stays well!</li>
    <li> Very smooth lip liners, and very nice shades. They blend ok... I&#x27;ve notice with a brush you will be able to see the stokes, but if using with your finger they work fine</li>
