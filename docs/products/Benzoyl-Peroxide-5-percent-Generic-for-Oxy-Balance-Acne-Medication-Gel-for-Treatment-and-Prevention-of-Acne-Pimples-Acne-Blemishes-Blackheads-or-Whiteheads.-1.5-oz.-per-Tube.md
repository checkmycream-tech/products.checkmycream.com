      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This stuff works GREAT!!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to use every 12h (if I don&#x27;t use it at night I wake up with a pimple).</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;d never guess because this works so wonderfully.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s excellent.  </li>
      <li>Works perfect, and I also recommend this to a lot of friends, too.</li>
      <li>Great price!!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>this is wonderful!</li>
      <li>And dirt cheap!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
      <li>5% is my staple acne medication and the amazon price is great for buying it in bulk.</li>
      <li>good shipping.</li>
      <li>just some good ol&#x27; benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
      <li>Rub it into your skin for a good 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>seems to do what it is supposed to and had a good price too.</li>
      <li>and I loved it.</li>
      <li>Possibly better even!</li>
      <li>Love using this !</li>
      <li>Love it though!</li>
      <li>This product is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>This product is effective in terms of reducing in grown hairs and acne.</li>
      <li>Research journals state that 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) is just as effective as 5% or 10% without the added dryness and irritation.</li>
      <li>Plus its cheap!</li>
      <li>I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And your better off buying the 3 pack.</li>
      <li>I love using 5% benzoyl peroxide.</li>
      <li>is that it dries out skin more aggressively than others.</li>
      <li>I had been using neutrogena on the spot (2.5% benzoyl peroxide), but this works just as well and for a better price.</li>
      <li>I also think it shrinks pimples more aggressively as well.</li>
      <li>The price is cheap and it is effective one my face.</li>
      <li>So glad I found this.</li>
      <li>Works great for getting those deep ones overnight :)</li>
      <li>It was way to strong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old, and fair skinned.</li>
      <li>You certainly get more bang for your buck per tube.</li>
      <li>Also, this will be good for my teen daughter, who does not need all that percentage.</li>
      <li>Such a good find</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works great and is cheaper than other brands.</li>
      <li>Also, to be most effective, don&#x27;t just dab it on your skin delicately.</li>
      <li>I used this as directed and it did absolutely nothing!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheaper than a lot of acne products at the store and strong enough for my oily skin!</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend sunscreen, and a moisturizing face wash like Purity by Philosophy and scent free moisturizer to apply at night.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this Benzoyl Peroxide product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It pretty much works the same as 5% benzoyl peroxide ancefree brand.</li>
      <li>In my opinion 10% is not better than 5, but 5 is better than 2 (proactive).</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Skin is miraculously clear.</li>
      <li>It fights and prevents acne without over drying my face like the old 10% I used to use.</li>
      <li>It completely cleared up my face</li>
      <li>: It helps to start off with smaller portion because this will irritate your skin if you use too much.</li>
      <li>skin is sensitive, oily, and acne prone.</li>
      <li>Gentle enough for his skin, and it does diminish the pimples.</li>
      <li>I would recommend you only apply it to the actual blemish, not surrounding areas as it really dries out the skin.</li>
      <li>2.5% worked ok but not great and 10% actually lightened my skin (and bits of my hair near my forehead!)</li>

<li> The worse part if I have 3 bottles of this crap!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was part of a prescription product my dermatologist recommended.  It was very expensive even with my insurance.  This seems to do the same.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s excellent.  good shipping.</li>
    <li> This stuff works GREAT!!!!! Wow! I would recommend you only apply it to the actual blemish, not surrounding areas as it really dries out the skin. Love it though! Works great for getting those deep ones overnight :)</li>
    <li> Received it on time! Love using this !</li>
    <li> just some good ol&#x27; benzoyl peroxide.  seems to do what it is supposed to and had a good price too.</li>
    <li> My skin was starting to turn horrible. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days and I already see improvements! Thanks</li>
    <li> Comes with three tubes and cheaper than what you would get in a drug store.</li>
    <li> Possibly better even! You certainly get more bang for your buck per tube. The only thing negative I have to say about this product is that it dries out skin more aggressively than others. I also think it shrinks pimples more aggressively as well.</li>
    <li> delivered on time and works like a charm. it&#x27;s cheaper than a lot of acne products at the store and strong enough for my oily skin! Would definitely recommend sunscreen, and a moisturizing face wash like Purity by Philosophy and scent free moisturizer to apply at night.</li>
    <li> Just what we needed. We actually needed it for our dog and we could not find a 5% everywhere was 10%. It was way to strong. Also, this will be good for my teen daughter, who does not need all that percentage.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, and I also recommend this to a lot of friends, too. One thing that we need to remember is that only apply the medicine on the Acne area, do not use it like face cream, cause it will dry your skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works to keep acne breakout to a minimum however it seems to harsh for my skin. Research journals state that 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) is just as effective as 5% or 10% without the added dryness and irritation. I do not like the stiff face feeling I get from this BP. I will go back to using my acne.org 2.5 BP.</li>
    <li> Helps dry out acne but doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin.  I apply at night only before bed after I washed my face. Helps get rid of faster</li>
    <li> I love using 5% benzoyl peroxide. In my opinion 10% is not better than 5, but 5 is better than 2 (proactive). 10% just causes uneeded dryness and irritation. I don&#x27;t get overly dry with the 5% and I feel it works equally as well.</li>
    <li> It works like it should and cost efficient. It pretty much works the same as 5% benzoyl peroxide ancefree brand.</li>
    <li> I am a Chinese, I think this product works for me. The price is cheap and it is effective one my face. I will definitely buy it later and recommends to my friends who also suffer from acne.</li>
    <li> Great product! It is clearing up my acne!</li>
    <li> I use this for my dog&#x27;s acne on the back and chin. Gentle enough for his skin, and it does diminish the pimples.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING. And dirt cheap!!!! I used to be on benzoyl peroxide erythromycin, which you get through a prescription. It completely cleared up my face and I loved it. But recently I switched to a different insurance and it became too expensive for me. I was desperate to find a cheap replacement (hard to let go of clear skin and go back to acne). But I found this gem and it actually works. Tip: It helps to start off with smaller portion because this will irritate your skin if you use too much. Also, to be most effective, don&#x27;t just dab it on your skin delicately. This is medicine. Rub it into your skin for a good 30 seconds. I like to leave it on overnight.</li>
    <li> My kitty has cat acne. Of course, if you use this on a cat, you have to be very careful and rub it in and rub the excess off. But I would wash my kitty&#x27;s face with nizoral, rinse it off well, towel dry and then rub in this. It works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. It&#x27;s works great and is cheaper than other brands.</li>
    <li> Skin is miraculously clear. I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
    <li> This product is effective in terms of reducing in grown hairs and acne. You have to apply it in moderation otherwise a film could surface. I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fan for Life</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years now and it&#x27;s the only product that truly works.!! I&#x27;m not kidding. !! I have oily skin and it work like a charm. I would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to get rid of their acne.</li>
    <li> I have moderate acne and you&#x27;d never guess because this works so wonderfully. It&#x27;s best to use every 12h (if I don&#x27;t use it at night I wake up with a pimple). 2.5% worked ok but not great and 10% actually lightened my skin (and bits of my hair near my forehead!) 5% is my staple acne medication and the amazon price is great for buying it in bulk. The drugstore formulations for some reason are either 2.5% or 10% so this is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great product! And your better off buying the 3 pack.</li>
    <li> Great price!! Seems to be clearing my acne without over drying my skin. Keeps the oil at bay throughout the day. I had been using neutrogena on the spot (2.5% benzoyl peroxide), but this works just as well and for a better price. Doesn&#x27;t seem to bleach fabrics as long as I&#x27;m relatively careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive, oily, and acne prone. I&#x27;m 31 years old, and fair skinned.</li>
    <li> Did nothing! I used this as directed and it did absolutely nothing! If anything it made my skin worse! I had only a few problems areas mainly on my cheeks and now my forehead and chin have completely broken out! The worse part if I have 3 bottles of this crap!</li>
    <li> So glad I found this. Stop spending $10+ on 0.8oz tubes in stores and pharmacies and order these.&lt;br /&gt;Over the counter generic that rocks. Such a good find</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin like the 10% formulations and still helps dry up my outbreaks.</li>
    <li> Used with another product. Works well together.&lt;br /&gt;Break outs are minimal once I used them daily.&lt;br /&gt;Product is a little grainy....not as refined but does its job.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this Benzoyl Peroxide product. It fights and prevents acne without over drying my face like the old 10% I used to use. Plus its cheap!</li>
