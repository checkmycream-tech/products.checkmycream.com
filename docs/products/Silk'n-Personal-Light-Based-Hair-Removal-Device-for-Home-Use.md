### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>it is awesome.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy I found Silk&#x27;n</li>
      <li>It works great!!</li>
      <li>It works great!!</li>
      <li>for me it is just perfect</li>
      <li>Like all light-based and laser removal methods, the Silk&#x27;n works best on lighter skin with darker hair...</li>
      <li>This device worked perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t spend $50 on a product and hoped for the best</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>When your wife is happy, you&#x27;re happy.  </li>
      <li>also found it&#x27;s best to use after a warm shower and</li>
      <li>How great to have a permanent reduction and not have to shave/wax.</li>
      <li>All in all, this is a great alternative to waxing for me.  </li>
      <li>but nothing great.</li>
      <li>How great to have a permanent reduction and not have to shave/wax.</li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m really really happy</li>
      <li>Some folks say it works great.  </li>
      <li>I think this is another reason why some people aren&#x27;t happy w/</li>
      <li>Once you get into that \\&quot;groove\\&quot; where the hair is reduced, it&#x27;s really very nice.      </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s about as effective as shining a torch on your hairs!</li>
      <li>This is just the kind of company they are, stay AWAY!</li>
      <li>By all measures I&#x27;m a good candidate.    </li>
      <li>so I know the lamp is still good.  </li>
      <li>Now some of the reviews I&#x27;ve seen on here don&#x27;t strike me as being too fair.  </li>
      <li>Good days.</li>
      <li>so it got good venting.  </li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s by the machine than I&#x27;ve lost about 10 good uses on the lamp.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have been using Silk&#x27;n on full legs for about 4 months, every 2 to 3 weeks, and I am very happy with result.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great and much more affordable alternative to laser hair removal.</li>
      <li>and I am really glad and happy</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>At first I was very happy</li>
      <li>It has to push out on its own time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>Because you have the hormone Testosterone, this device may not be totally effective.</li>
      <li>My legs are very smooth and hair is sparse.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a very fair skinned girl with very dark hair on my legs and nether region and this machine has worked great for me.</li>
      <li>But with about as twice as many treatments.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I decided I was going to use it one more time</li>
      <li>-can be used on most body parts.    </li>
      <li>Ok, this works.  </li>
      <li>With this machine, you&#x27;d grow darker, longer and more hair than before.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it does work better and is easier to use than No</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t been able to use the product in the 2 weeks since it&#x27;s receipt and STILL no hope for resolution.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to maintain the results without spending thousands of dollars more with Doctors office prices.</li>
      <li>I have more lamps in stock:)</li>
      <li>with better reviews than this thing.  </li>
      <li>Your head has about 90% of hairs growing but it is the most of any body part.  </li>
      <li>I love this product...</li>
      <li>It seems to work when I can get it to function, but most of the time I give up with sore thumbs.</li>
      <li>, this device may require many treatments and you may always be battling hair removal.</li>
      <li>I abolutely love my Silkn.  </li>
      <li>I am the ideal candidate with fair skin and very dark course hair.  </li>
      <li>Often I cannot get the light to flash without many repeated attempts.  </li>
      <li>the cost was more than the product cost originally.</li>
      <li>since this is at home and not a salon, you can get it under control easily and zap the hairs as they come along.  </li>
      <li>I have very light skin and medium dark hair, and professional pulsed-light hair removal has been very effective for me, so I should have been an ideal candidate.</li>
      <li>The light is also very bright, so it hurts the eyes, and only because of this, I give it 4 stars and not 5, other wise LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I barely felt any pain and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>To my surprise there were huge areas on my leg that had no hair re-growth.  </li>
      <li>A &#x60;scrubbie&#x27; to lightly exfoliate the area will help it move out faster, but you can&#x27;t force it to push out ahead of its time.</li>
      <li>I have light skin and brownish or darker hair on lower legs and bikini line.  </li>
      <li>During the course of that time, I wasn&#x27;t hair free</li>
      <li>In sum, I used it every 15 days for 10 months, experienced some hair reduction during this time, but then it all grew back.</li>
      <li>but then it became available online</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, it take me about 30 minutes max to do to full legs inclusing bikin line plus underarms.</li>
      <li>three hair removal sessions and not all of the hair was gone-though significantly lessened).</li>
      <li>Maybe they just weren&#x27;t lucky like me to be a light skinned Spaniard.      </li>
      <li>keeping the lamp clean is important.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I get about 1 full body treatment out of each cartridge.    </li>
      <li>Please see your medical practitioner if you suspect PCOS because if you treat that issue first, the hair removal will not be as stubborn and it will be effective, certainly better than shaving!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The more darker parts of your body you use it on will have a slight burning feeling for about a day at most (be sure to read the warnings about skin tone).      </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I used the device under a Doctor&#x27;s supervision that my expectations and results were more realistic.    </li>
      <li>If you are fair and light skinned with dark hair this machine will indeed help to decrease your hair.</li>
      <li>think of a pale \\&quot;Italian\\&quot; or \\&quot;Spaniard\\&quot; for an idea of what the ideal candidate is...and it works for those folks pretty well.  </li>
      <li>It worked great on the lower legs (used it on 2 spots twice to test and see how it felt when I first used it and those 2 areas have an 75% hair loss) but other areas</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny, but the hair is not gone over night.</li>
      <li>What I don&#x27;t like is that silkn charges more for the replacement cartridges for this early model.  </li>
      <li>And if you&#x27;re doing your chin or cheekbones, you&#x27;re looking into a mirror, right?</li>
      <li>And if you&#x27;re doing your chin or cheekbones, you&#x27;re looking into a mirror, right?</li>
      <li>I am at the 18 month mark which is pretty much what it takes for all hair cycles to take place in humans and am hair free on legs and bikini area.  </li>
      <li>It will burn the skin or any dark areas (like moles) on fair skin.  </li>
      <li>I have fair skin with dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m hoping that I can get a replacement - and hope that the new one does not crap out like this one did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The lamp has about 40 more flashes left on it</li>
      <li>and it really is!  </li>
      <li>-hair started falling out two weeks after the first treatment.   </li>
      <li>Still harry ;)</li>
      <li>I noticed results after the first use.  </li>
      <li>Again, because you all have testosterone it will be a battle against the hair that will require several more treatments than a woman may need.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was working well</li>
      <li>She saw results after the first use.</li>
      <li>I rated 4 because when don&#x27;t know the final result but at this moment everything seems OK.</li>
      <li>I admit that I didn&#x27;t do the treatments exactly when directed over time because I would leave town for weeks at a time and not have access to the machine, so I would just do it when I got home.</li>
      <li>yeah I pretty much gave up on this.  </li>
      <li>I tried on my arms initially, but the hair is too light to see much results but did reduce about 50% over 12 months.  </li>
      <li>it really</li>
      <li>regrowth is much slower and finer.   </li>
      <li>I was a very hairy Spaniard.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have been using Silk&#x27;n on full legs for about 4 months, every 2 to 3 weeks, and I am very happy with result. I am still shaving but now only every 4 to 5 days where as before silk&#x27;n I had horrible hard black stubble every day and had to shave every morning. I no longer have the stubble or shaving rash or ingrown hairs. My legs are very smooth and hair is sparse. I will keep using it for the recommended 18 months. All those that said hair grew back, maybe you need to keep going - if you read the literature with it, it explains hair cycles keep coming back, and it will take 18 months or so to get every cycle. It&#x27;s easy to use, it take me about 30 minutes max to do to full legs inclusing bikin line plus underarms. Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Bulbs are costly but still cheaper and mroe convenient than going to salon.    I am very happy I found Silk&#x27;n, hope I can say the same at then end of 18 months.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 5-6 treatments on my chest abdomen and arm pits. At first I thought it was working well but as soon as I stopped zapping every single hair grew back exactly the same. I am very disappointed that this thing does not work as it should. Oh and those stupid bulbs are extremely over priced.. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this thing.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s been a lot of back-and-forth about the Silk&#x27;n device online.  Some folks say it works great.  Others say it doesn&#x27;t work at all and is a total scam.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I used the device under a Doctor&#x27;s supervision that my expectations and results were more realistic.    Like all light-based and laser removal methods, the Silk&#x27;n works best on lighter skin with darker hair...think of a pale \\&quot;Italian\\&quot; or \\&quot;Spaniard\\&quot; for an idea of what the ideal candidate is...and it works for those folks pretty well.  If you&#x27;re blonde-haired and blue-eyed...don&#x27;t waste your money on this or any hair removal method other than electrolysis.     I am a white male.  I have a lighter skin tone.  My hair is brown to dark brown, depending on where we&#x27;re talking about.  My arms are lightest...my chest and stomach are darkest.  I used Silk&#x27;n on my chest and stomach and nowhere else.  By all measures I&#x27;m a good candidate.    How does it work?  It works well at killing hairs that are there.  Most of the active hairs do fall out and you have several weeks of smoothness, just like waxing. They do grow back eventually, but if you&#x27;re using the device regularly, you&#x27;re slowly widdling away at the growth cycles of the hair, so it appears that less hair is growing back, when it actuality it&#x27;s all growing back but you&#x27;re just interrupting the cycle so often you don&#x27;t notice.  After a while, you just do it every few months and you&#x27;re fine...but you&#x27;ll never stop using it.  Once you get into that \\&quot;groove\\&quot; where the hair is reduced, it&#x27;s really very nice.      LET THIS BE SAID FOR CLARIFICATION:  IF YOU STOP USING THIS DEVICE, ALL OF THE HAIR DOES GROW BACK eventually.  It takes a while, but you&#x27;re not permanently killing anything...you&#x27;re just slowing down the cycle and constantly zapping the hairs that are there...since this is at home and not a salon, you can get it under control easily and zap the hairs as they come along.  This is EXACTLY the same results I had with professional laser/IPL removal in a doctor&#x27;s office....NOT PERMANENT.  If you&#x27;re looking for permanence, get electrolysis and take 15 years under the needle.    All in all, this is a great alternative to waxing for me.  The results last longer and it&#x27;s far cheaper overall than going to the salon.  I also can do it at home.  I also noticed a pronounced reduction in my ingrown hairs on the treated areas.    No one promised me a permanently hairless body, but I was assured a reasonable reduction.  This is much easier than shaving, waxing, or going to the salon.  The cost of the bulbs doesn&#x27;t even come close to what I would be spending on waxing.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Silk&#x27;n March of 2009 and used as directed every couple of weeks in the beginning and later waited 3 weeks between treatments. I focused on the lower part of my legs because the hair there is very dark and course. You are supposed to shave before each treatment so that there is less hair for the laser to try and remove. I admit that I didn&#x27;t do the treatments exactly when directed over time because I would leave town for weeks at a time and not have access to the machine, so I would just do it when I got home. There were also times when I didn&#x27;t have the money to get a new cartridge, so I would have to wait until I could afford to purchase refills before I could do another treatment. Sometimes I would do treatments 2 weeks apart and sometimes I couldn&#x27;t make it back until 6 weeks later. After 10 months of using the Silk&#x27;n (very inconsistently) I started to get discouraged because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any difference in the growth thickness or any hair loss. Not to mention the money that I was pouring into this thing and not seeing any reward. I decided I was going to use it one more time and if there was no difference then I was going to sell it and try to get some of my wasted money back. After my last treatment in March 2010 I stopped shaving my legs for a week to see if it would all grow back. To my surprise there were huge areas on my leg that had no hair re-growth.  There were little areas (spots of 6-10 hairs) that the hair grew back on - maybe because I didn&#x27;t cover them well enough with the laser. I still - one month later - am just shaving my legs to see if the hair is going to grow back and those areas are still bare. So, keeping into consideration that I was very inconsistent with the treatments and probably missed a few areas each time because it&#x27;s hard to remember what areas you&#x27;ve already lasered, I believe 100% that this product works to permanently remove hair after being used for 18 months.</li>
    <li> I have used it consistently for months, following the directions, i.e. 6~8 times (I lost count) without any appreciable reduction in hair.  I have very light skin and medium dark hair, and professional pulsed-light hair removal has been very effective for me, so I should have been an ideal candidate.</li>
    <li> I am at the 18 month mark which is pretty much what it takes for all hair cycles to take place in humans and am hair free on legs and bikini area.  I tried on my arms initially, but the hair is too light to see much results but did reduce about 50% over 12 months.  Bikini area took longest as hair is coarser in this location.  If you give up after 6 to 9 months, especially for men, you will not notice much difference.  I am about 12 months in on my husband who has very coarse, dark hair and it is slower going than my hair which was less coarse and a light to medium brown, but it is reducing the amount especially after last treatment 6 weeks ago.  I figure it may take us longer than the 18 months with him, but not much more.  If you read all the instructions and watch the video and maybe a little research on the side, you will learn that not all hair is in its growth cycle at the same time.  Your head has about 90% of hairs growing but it is the most of any body part.  For men, chest hair is a much smaller percent growing at any given time, so it&#x27;s just going to take more treatments over longer period of time to destroy follicles in active stage of growth.</li>
    <li> At first I was very happy cause I did see some hair loss, but some weeks later the hair that had fallen started growing back. It was supposed to work very well in my case, because the manual says that if you have very dark hair and very white skin, it should be more efficient with the burning of the folicules.    In sum, I used it every 15 days for 10 months, experienced some hair reduction during this time, but then it all grew back. So I have to say I am very disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I have been using it for five months as directed with NO RESULTS! Dont buy it!</li>
    <li> I have to shave every day.  I tried everthing except professional laser and nothing worked.  Have been using the silk&#x27;n for about 6 weeks now and the difference is unbelievable.    Pros:  -hair started falling out two weeks after the first treatment.   -hair regrowth is much slower and finer.   -Am starting to see bald patches where the hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be growing at all.   -can be used on most body parts.    -works on very coarse hair.    Cons:   -It takes a long time and I found it impossible to treat my legs without overlapping and missing some spots.    -Having to buy replacement cartridges.  I get about 1 full body treatment out of each cartridge.    I love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my unit since March and at first I used it every other week as directed.  Then I started using it every week. At first the hairs seem to stop growing, but I think it just sort of \\&quot;shocks\\&quot; the follicle and slows the growth down, but does not disable it. And then my hairs didn&#x27;t even \\&quot;fall out\\&quot; like the manual said they would, they just hung around until I plucked them out! After about 10-15 treatments on various areas of my body, there is not a single area that is without hair.  It grows back.  I should have bought the TRIA for all the time I&#x27;ve spent with the worthless Silk&#x27;n.  If you&#x27;re reading this, consider something else.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;v done about 4 sessions now.  I&#x27;m not a hairy monster but I got some, who should I put it, scary areas that needed my constant attention (bikini area), after these sessions, I see a huge reduction, I would say about half of my \\&quot;condition\\&quot; is gone now, I was not sure if it was working but it really does and it is awesome.  My recommendation, shave as close as possible, the shorter the hair the better, this is because the light has less hair length to travel into the root to zap it to death.  Of course, no pain, no gain, I use the highest intensity which can be a bit painful (specially at my scary area).  The light is also very bright, so it hurts the eyes, and only because of this, I give it 4 stars and not 5, other wise LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I received a Silk&#x27;n pro as a gift.  Since the day it was first plugged in, it required extreme pressure, often using 2 hands to press the button to get the light cartridge to flash.  This means I can&#x27;t really use it for my underarms as a 2 handed button press just isn&#x27;t feasible.  Often I cannot get the light to flash without many repeated attempts.  It seems to work when I can get it to function, but most of the time I give up with sore thumbs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now. I have what I would define as &#x27;medium&#x27; hair, in terms of coarseness and color, and it has made only a slight difference.  I used it on my armpits, legs, and bikini area, and the only place that was noticeably different is on my legs where the hair is the least coarse to begin with.  I had been waxing before getting this, and with not seeing a change, I&#x27;ve since gone back to waxing, because the hair is still just too thick and obnoxious, so yeah I pretty much gave up on this.  It&#x27;s ridiculously expensive, considering I&#x27;ve recently seen other products, MUCH cheaper (that don&#x27;t need refill cartridges!) with better reviews than this thing.  The cartridges are a pain as well, I&#x27;ve burned through about 4 of them, they&#x27;re NOT cheap, and that&#x27;s including the one that, even though you&#x27;re supposed to get a certain amount of &#x27;flashes&#x27; per cartridge (I don&#x27;t remember how much), it shorted out after only using about 1/2 of what it was supposed to.  Maybe I can get something out of it on craigslist or something.........</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to have laser hair treatment for a while now, but I always heard from friends that it&#x27;s extremely painful.  I bought Silkn because I heard that it was much less painful that laser treatments and it really is!  I barely felt any pain and it worked great.  I noticed a difference in just a couple of weeks.  Even my boyfriend noticed the difference and he never notices stuff like that.  I abolutely love my Silkn.  It&#x27;s a great and much more affordable alternative to laser hair removal.</li>
    <li> I tried laser hair removal in professional clinics and then when I was stranded in a duty station, where such services don&#x27;t exist I had to buy this machine. My advice to all women to seek professional help.   In professional clinics, a month later you notice you have less hair than before the session. With this machine, you&#x27;d grow darker, longer and more hair than before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very fair skinned girl with very dark hair on my legs and nether region and this machine has worked great for me. I have gotten professional laser hair removal done for about 8 session on my bikini area and it decreased hair to about 75% with about 25% regrowth after stopping. I wanted to maintain the results without spending thousands of dollars more with Doctors office prices. I took a chance and I&#x27;m glad I took it because it has decreased my hair to about 50% on my legs and some spots are totally hairless now. I have been using this for about a year but only went through two cartridges. I did take a short break and saw some regrowth but nothing great. I am pleased with the results and the negative reviews are from those people who are unrealistic in their expectations. If you are fair and light skinned with dark hair this machine will indeed help to decrease your hair.</li>
    <li> She saw results after the first use. I rated 4 because when don&#x27;t know the final result but at this moment everything seems OK.</li>
    <li> I am using the silk&#x27;n for about a year and I am really glad and happy I have it! for me it is just perfect</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Works as expected.  When your wife is happy, you&#x27;re happy.  Good days.</li>
    <li> I BROUGHT MY MACHINE OVER 4 THOUSANDS STILL HAIRS GROW BACK LIKE NORMAL. EVEN MY FRIENDS WENT TO LASER INSTITUTE FOR THE HAIR REMOVAL BUT STILL GROW BACK JUST LESSER AND THINNER  WHICH COSTS ARRANG 6-7 THOUSAND DOLLARS.</li>
    <li> Well let me start by saying I am a male.  A hairy male.  Damn-near every male on my father&#x27;s side is hair and I didn&#x27;t want to be.  I spend years looking for something to handle it.  But always went back to shaving.  When I heard about the Silk&#x27;n I knew I&#x27;d be getting it.    Now some of the reviews I&#x27;ve seen on here don&#x27;t strike me as being too fair.  Some reviewers are saying that the Silk&#x27;n won&#x27;t work on the thick hair of men.  Not true!  My hair is pretty thick.  Maybe they just weren&#x27;t lucky like me to be a light skinned Spaniard.      But here are the down sides as I see them:      *It will take multiple treatments.  I&#x27;m about 2 months into using it every other weekend.    *The more darker parts of your body you use it on will have a slight burning feeling for about a day at most (be sure to read the warnings about skin tone).      *AND the actual size of the area that gets treated w/ each flash is smaller then I thought.  As a result I can see patches of hair on some areas that I guess were getting missed.  I think this is another reason why some people aren&#x27;t happy w/ the Silk&#x27;n -- they&#x27;re not treating the same spot everytime.  It (The Silk&#x27;n) looks like it only covers about a square inch of skin.  But the areas that I know for a fact have been treated everytime have NO hair growth.    All in all, I&#x27;m really really happy w/ the Silk&#x27;n.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. Have used it for 4 months with no noticeable reduction in hair growth at all. It&#x27;s about as effective as shining a torch on your hairs!</li>
    <li> Please beware of buying this item. I bought it about a year ago for $400 and now I can&#x27;t find replacement lamp cartridges. I have bought then from Silk&#x27;n directly but now they don&#x27;t sell them. I&#x27;ve tried eBay but the one supplier doesn&#x27;t ship to the US. Amazon supplier (and there is only one) and it comes from Israel and the product I ordered was not what I received and to return it the cost was more than the product cost originally. Please do not purchase this unit and beware of any Silk&#x27;n product cause they do not support the product in the long run. I didn&#x27;t spend $50 on a product and hoped for the best, I spent good money on a product I was planning on using for a long time. Still harry ;)</li>
    <li> This product DOES NOT WORK! I have light skin, dark hair, used it as instructed and it did not do a thing!   I recommend you do not buy it. Now... if you are incredulous about the reviews and you have to see for yourself, do yourself a favor and buy it on amazon. I made the  mistake of buying it directly from the so called SILKN STORE, and let me tell you I still think about them months after the ordeal. They say they return your money, but they do everything in their power not to give you a refund. They lied, said they had sent me a check, etc, ended up giving me a partial refund (this all happened from Feb 2010 to Sep 2010- that is how long it took them to return part of my money). Well, now it is Nov 2010, and I just found out they are typing in my credit card info, making fraudulent charges without my authorization. This is just the kind of company they are, stay AWAY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item about 3 years ago, when it was about $700. I was a very hairy Spaniard. After using this item for 4 years and allowing sometimes months between treatments, even 9 months of a pregnancy. My hair is 90% gone on my legs and the remaining is very thin and it grows very slowly. I love the results, after growing up with a huge excessive hair complex and not even wearing shorts ever. It just takes time and dedication. I purchased a total of 6 bulbs in those years. And I have only used it on my legs. It is worth every penny, but the hair is not gone over night. It might take a few winter months of usage to get visible results for summer. Not many people have the hair amount that I had. I also had laser done on my bikini line, underarms and face and the results are about the same with both methods, except for the laser treatments were a lot more expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this machine 6 months ago.  It worked great on the lower legs (used it on 2 spots twice to test and see how it felt when I first used it and those 2 areas have an 75% hair loss) but other areas I saw minimal results (went through 6 lamps using it a level 5 to bikini line area with maybe a 15% hair loss).  I have fair skin with dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also have problems with the machine.  At first, it was hard to get the machine to level up.  I had to push the buttons twice before it would allow me to do so.  Than  3 weeks ago, I noticed that changed and it started leveling up the way the manual stated but the lamp would stop working.  I would push the button and no flash would happen yet it would beep a few seconds later as if it did.  I used it times and with each use, this problem would happen sooner.  I went to use it yesterday and the lamp won&#x27;t flash at all.  The lamp has about 40 more flashes left on it so I know the lamp is still good.  I had the machine on a table so it got good venting.  I don&#x27;t know what the problem is.  Plus I&#x27;m worried that I lost flashes due to the machine beeping even after the lamp failed to flash.  I don&#x27;t know if the count on lamp usage is calculated by the machine or the lamp itself.  If it&#x27;s by the machine than I&#x27;ve lost about 10 good uses on the lamp.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to decide whether I should buy another one due to having 2 unused lamps or pay more for the VISS IPL and just eat the $ of the lamps I still have.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does work better and is easier to use than No No and other non-lamp forms of hair remove.&lt;br /&gt;Pain wise--it feels like being snapped with a rubber band for a second then warm/hot especially when you first start using it. I recommend starting at level 1 or 2 to get a sense of what it feels like.  I used it at the highest level in a sensitive area and maybe once or twice per session I would feel the snapping pain but overall, I think your body gets use to it but I also read the brightness of the lamps decrease as they are used.&lt;br /&gt;I also found it&#x27;s best to use after a warm shower and keeping the lamp clean is important.&lt;br /&gt;This product is not for tanned or med to dark skin tones.  It will burn the skin or any dark areas (like moles) on fair skin.  The reason is that the light targets the melanin (causes dark pigment to hair and skin) in hair but it doesn&#x27;t know the difference between hair and skin.  For the same reason, it will not work on blond, gray or red hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product...thats the easiest way to get read of unwanted hair...it really works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t live without it anymore!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast track and delivery...&lt;br /&gt;now I have more lamps in stock:)</li>
    <li> I have no way of explaining why this worked for some and not for others (assuming they all had similar skin tone and hair color).  I am the ideal candidate with fair skin and very dark course hair.  I noticed results after the first use.  I used it once every three weeks I think in the beginning, maybe for a total of three times. Then it became summer and I didn&#x27;t want to damage my skin so forgot about it for about seven months.  During the course of that time, I wasn&#x27;t hair free but I had significantly less hair on my legs.  And the hair I had left is softer and less annoying.  I think this product works.  I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal on my underarms in the past and I found this product to produce equal results. (I had three hair removal sessions and not all of the hair was gone-though significantly lessened). I cannot attest to those reviewers saying it&#x27;s not permanent because I thought it was through killing the follicle.  I can only think that they&#x27;re noticing hair regrowth from hair that was in a different stage of its life cycle when it was zapped. I don&#x27;t know but I know hair grows in cycles so some may be dormant during the time that you use the laser. Just my thoughts. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but directly from the company when it first came out. (I got it &amp;#34;at cost&amp;#34; from the company since I am a physician and they wanted me to sell it out of my office - but then it became available online so I just told patients about it).  I used it for months and watched the hair on my legs and underarms get lighter and thinner with each use.  I haven&#x27;t used it for over a year and I still have very thin and sparse hair growth only.  I love only having to shave every few days (or less).  This device worked perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> Ok, this works.  I have light skin and brownish or darker hair on lower legs and bikini line.  What I don&#x27;t like is that silkn charges more for the replacement cartridges for this early model.  It adds up and will make this model far more expensive than the later ones.  Sold mine on ebay, now I&#x27;m looking at a different model.  I was going to get the remington but the cartridges seem to have issues in quality according to the reviews.  Hair removal is not permanent but w/this it is easy and long lasting.  The cartridges do add up though and it&#x27;s ongoing.  Cheaper and easier than professional waxing.</li>
    <li> Seller sent a European electric cord, and seller will not reply to my inquiries regarding replacing either the cord or the product completely. This is frustrating ... haven&#x27;t been able to use the product in the 2 weeks since it&#x27;s receipt and STILL no hope for resolution.  If the Seller would simply provide Some response to my several inquiries.</li>
    <li> In reference to a comment below . . . The hair that &#x27;grows back eventually&#x27; is not the same hair that was zapped; it is new hair from new follicles. And you are not &#x60;interrupting the cycle,&#x27; rather, you are actually destroying the hair and the follicle with each effective &#x60;zap.&#x27; But only the &#x60;active&#x27; hair follicles. The thousands of other follicles underneath are just sleeping zombies  waiting for their chance to start growing a hair. Once a hair follicle is killed, a group of others take to growing and producing a hair. After a hair zap, the individual hair takes several days for the hair to start pushing up and out of the dying follicle and then the follicle shrinks up and dies. A few days after a treatment, the hair in the area you treated may seem like it&#x27;s getting longer. Actually, it&#x27;s the shrinking follicle pushing out the dead hair. A &#x60;scrubbie&#x27; to lightly exfoliate the area will help it move out faster, but you can&#x27;t force it to push out ahead of its time. And you can&#x27;t tweeze it out when it starts pushing out. It has to push out on its own time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One never sees all the follicles and the &#x27;potential&#x27; hair that you have. Genetics determines that. It may appear that the same hair is growing back when in fact you may have thousands and thousands of hair follicles underneath your skin with NO hairs growing. When you zap some of the surface hairs, that hair is killed and the respective follicle shrinks up. But then a number of follicles underneath the surface &#x60;come alive&#x27; and start growing hairs. (So don&#x27;t waste your money by using your cartridges faster by treating sooner than what is recommended . . . according to this manufacturer, hair growth in its respective hair follicle grows in a 2 week cycle, hence their recommendation that you do treatments every two weeks. &#x27;Zapping&#x27; sooner than the 2wks recommended is just a waste of the cartridge and its finite number of flashes.  (Hey, the manufacturer knows their product, right?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word to the men:&lt;br /&gt;1. Because you have the hormone Testosterone, this device may not be totally effective. You will be battling this because testosterone just wants you guys to have hair. I did professional laser hair removal for several years with the BIG machines and we always told our men that they might need more treatments due to testosterone - but eventually, we did the hair levels down to a very low number that our clients were happy with. But with about as twice as many treatments.&lt;br /&gt;2. A word of caution: if you want to just &#x60;thin&#x27; out your beard, you may end up with &#x60;bald spots&#x27; on your face. This is because the laser is not selective as to which follicles it will destroy. We had an individual of middle- eastern descent who wanted to keep his beard, but he wanted it much thinner. We advised him that we could not guarantee that he beard would not look &#x60;spotty&#x27; and suggested that he keep it as it was or go all the way with the treatments to obtain total hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;3. Again, because you all have testosterone it will be a battle against the hair that will require several more treatments than a woman may need. And you may be hair free for several years and then start growing SOME hair back years later. A few zaps could keep that under control, but again, testosterone is the key difference in how the hair is removed and whether you will be totally hair-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word to Ladies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) where your little ol&#x27; hormones are off a tad with a bit of extra testosterone (you know, you have that &#x60;moustache&#x27; that seems a little heavier than the next girl . . . or a little more chin/facial hair that you&#x27;ve been fighting for years), this device may require many treatments and you may always be battling hair removal. Please see your medical practitioner if you suspect PCOS because if you treat that issue first, the hair removal will not be as stubborn and it will be effective, certainly better than shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had my hair done on my legs and toes and underarms 6-7 years ago where I worked. How great to have a permanent reduction and not have to shave/wax. Recently, however, I have noticed some &#x60;strays&#x27; that are coming up on my legs, chin and underarms. Not a lot, but enough for me to notice. And since my age is such that some grays are starting to poke around, I KNEW had to zap &#x60;em while they were still dark. So I purchased the Silk&#x27;N to take care of it. It works great!! Unfortunately, I only used it one cycle and was preparing to go the second cycle (2.5weeks later) and the little bugger quit out on me. What a disappointment!! It just stopped firing. So I am returning it for a refund or exchange. But it DID work! I noticed the chin hairs eased out just like we would see on our clients when we used the &#x60;big guns.&#x27; So I&#x27;m hoping that I can get a replacement - and hope that the new one does not crap out like this one did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word to everyone: please get eye protection. Sunglasses are not the same. And if you&#x27;re doing your chin or cheekbones, you&#x27;re looking into a mirror, right? Any flash of the laser that reflects into the mirror can bounce off the mirror into your eye(s) causing major eye damage to your retinas. This machine may not be the &#x60;big gun&#x27; but it is a laser and can cause damage. And no kids in the room when you&#x27;re doing your knuckle hair - they can be the recipient of a stray laser shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this device  . . . finally a home device for hair removal.  Hope my Silk&#x27;n was just a defective unit and the replacement one lasts me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four Stars because the item didn&#x27;t last beyond the first treatment. I&#x27;ll report when the replacement comes as to whether it lasts longer than this one did./&gt;I had my hair done on my legs and toes and underarms 6-7 years ago where I worked.
