      <li>/&gt;This is a very good quality set of brushes.. and is also the price is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love them</li>
      <li>I want to buy more but they seem to be out of stock</li>
      <li>it was okay,</li>
      <li>The packaging wrapper was filled with hair.</li>
      <li>They had good shape and consistency, but after cleaning them for one week with makeup brush cleaner, they completely began to fall apart.</li>
      <li>Originally I did like the brushes.</li>
      <li>Please purchase them they are worth the moneyand</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to have such a nice quality for 3 dollars.</li>
      <li>What made them priced these brushes 11 dollars when the hair are falling right away before even using it.</li>
      <li>The only thing they have is nice colors like the real technique ones.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft so they do not exfoliate the product off your face, but they are dense so they pick up a good amount of product at the same time.</li>
      <li>i love all the brushes except for the gold one because the hairs fall out constantly.</li>
      <li>These brushes are exactly like real techniques for a quarter of the price.</li>
      <li>Dupes for the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t complain too much...</li>
      <li>These are very acceptabe affordable substitutes for the higher-priced ones.</li>
      <li>my main issue is that the brushes shed a lot.</li>
      <li>very soft and are of same quality as real techniques brushes at a very cheaper price....</li>
      <li>the bristles are very soft.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t shed and very soft.</li>
      <li>Amazing brushes I thought they would be bad because they are really cheap</li>
      <li>They feel like so soft</li>
      <li>I was surprised when i got this, cause i bought it to teach</li>
      <li>My friends who won them as gifts love them and commented how soft and thick they are.</li>
      <li>Love these brushes and I use them everyday would definetaly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend, beginner or professional</li>
      <li>I bought it for my daughter, she apparently loves the set.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re soft, and I reach for them daily!</li>
      <li>My only complaint was that I got a flat top brush instead of an angle brush as in picture above.</li>
      <li>Which maybe the reason why I don&#x27;t use the flat brush as much as the other two brushes.</li>

<li> These were definitely a waste of money and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them at all.</li>
<li> The bristles slowly started coming out until I had no choice but to toss them.</li>
<li> so i dont have to use my expensive brushes, but it honeslty suprised</li>

    <li> I love these brushes! Very awesome Real Techniques dupe (which is one of my all-time favorite brush brands). I got them for my fiancee and she was very happy with them. The bristles are soft so they do not exfoliate the product off your face, but they are dense so they pick up a good amount of product at the same time. Would definitely recommend, beginner or professional - I just wish they had more!</li>
    <li> These brushes are exactly like real techniques for a quarter of the price. Great value for great quality i recommend everyone to try these!</li>

    <li> I just received the shipment. The brushes looked nice from outside but the quality is horrible. What made them priced these brushes 11 dollars when the hair are falling right away before even using it. I do not know why some people have given 5 stars. I think the 5 star reviews are not genuine.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy 2 good brushes by re techniques by sam and nikki chapmon.</li>
    <li> I received the item on item. Quality wise it was okay, infact great with this price. I&#x27;ve used it and washed it quite a lot and happy to say that it hasn&#x27;t shed a bit. My only complaint was that I got a flat top brush instead of an angle brush as in picture above. Which maybe the reason why I don&#x27;t use the flat brush as much as the other two brushes.</li>
    <li> Used these as gifts for a baby shower. My friends who won them as gifts love them and commented how soft and thick they are. Hope they stock up again I want to buy more but they seem to be out of stock</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter, she apparently loves the set.</li>
    <li> i love all the brushes except for the gold one because the hairs fall out constantly. i can even use it or i will have it all over my face!</li>

    <li> Nice brushes for great price.</li>
    <li> They feel like so soft</li>
    <li> Seriously, for the price, these are so worth it. They&#x27;re soft, and I reach for them daily! I ended up purchasing a backup set!</li>
