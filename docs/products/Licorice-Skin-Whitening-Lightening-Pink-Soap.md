      <li>I washed my whole body, then rinsed and as I toweled off my skin was still sloughing.  </li>
      <li>but my skin wasn&#x27;t able to peel, i bought this soap since i have some scars due to allergy.</li>
      <li>and I would not recommend using it more than 2-3 times per week due to its drying properties.</li>
      <li>am a fair skin black female and</li>
      <li>it does not dry out your skin and leaves it feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>rinse wait a couple minutes then wash again as this soap keeps working to exfoliate apparently after the first wash.  </li>
      <li>lap so far is.</li>
      <li>I am 66 years old, and discoloration comes with age and leaves with this soap.</li>
      <li>Time will tell if it was worth the money I spent, but I do like the product.</li>
      <li>I apply it and lesser on for ten minutes then rinse with cool water, pat dry with paper towel.</li>
      <li>It does not dry out my skin but leaves it feeling baa by soft.</li>

<li> My skin has been improving but not sure if it is because of this or the lightening gel I use after it.</li>
<li> Results are  slow</li>
<li> Not good waste of $$$!!!</li>
<li> This is a fake soap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After reading the positive reviews, I had to try this soap. I been using this soap for two months and I am 2 shades lighter. I looked in the mirror and I could not believe how I look. My face is clear the dark spots on my arms and legs are lighter. I went from Brown to light Brown, also this soap last for 3-4 weeks and gentle on my skin. I was using Kojie San Kojic Skin Lightening Soap for 3-4 months and that soap worked great and it is cheaper. This soap work better for me. Licorice soap did not work right away, I had to wait till this soap get use to my skin and I love the results. I want people to know lightening soaps will not make you light skin, it just clear and brighten your skin. Also try lightening pills, lotions and lightening creams.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers well and cleans my face well.  It has a lovely aroma and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  Don&#x27;t know yet if it is actually lightening my skin, but I do like the product.  Probably won&#x27;t order again because at $13 it is a little pricey for my budget.  However, the seller was excellent.  My purchase came on time and well wrapped.  Time will tell if it was worth the money I spent, but I do like the product.</li>
    <li> I so glad my research worked out o getting this  soap.  I just used it, and I am truly amazed on how clean , and yes lighter . I honestly feel that this soap will be a wonderfull addition o my beauty treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I am a fair skin black female and some iMessage dark spots stand out on the body.&lt;br /&gt;I love the first use and looking  forwardo continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;I will let you know more after a month.&lt;br /&gt;This lap so far is. Keeper.&lt;br /&gt;I have  tried so many that did not work. I hope this helps, try it. I did my home work</li>
    <li> ive been using it for about a month on my face and sometimes on my body. Twice a day and i havent noticed a difference i have like a half of a bar left (i break off pieces) the soap cost too much to with shipping i think i paid $14.00 or something. I will finish the whole bar cost too much to waste it. If something changes i will come back and edit it. i doubt it. I will not purchase this aga In</li>
    <li> i like the smell and potency of this soap. you don&#x27;t need much to get a good lather so i just break chunks off the bar. My skin has been improving but not sure if it is because of this or the lightening gel I use after it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself but my daughter used it one day and could not believe how clean and clear her skin was.  I did not get it back since so now I need to buy 2 more.  Its good and best of all it does not dry out your skin and leaves it feeling smooth and soft.  Love it!</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve never used this soap, Haven&#x27;t seem results yet but I&#x27;m sure  in time I will. Very happy with the soap, skin feels very nice. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> No results after two weeks. Very dry skin after use</li>
    <li> It did what it promised to do.  For the first time in my life I&#x27;ve found a skin care product that proves true to its testimony.  I love it.  It really works!</li>
    <li> Love this product it exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after doing research here on Amazon, and when I first tried it I was skeptical, I haven&#x27;t ever used bar soap on my face. I&#x27;ve tried so many expensive cleansers that claim to diminish acne scars and discoloration and all that it did for my skin was irritate it, after trying this for just a couple nights there was already difference. I use it with a spin brush for my face and it&#x27;s truly amazing and worked really well with my skin. Afterwards I moisturized with Rose Hip Oil and it&#x27;s honestly just made my skin GLOW. Everyone always tells me now my skin is luminous and beautiful looking. I just purchased my second bar, I recommend this!</li>
    <li> Works great just be sure to use a light moisturizer if you have dry skin this is my 2nd time purchasing</li>
    <li> This is a fake soap. Its been a month that i have been using this soap but my skin wasn&#x27;t able to peel, i bought this soap since i have some scars due to allergy.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful!!! It has really helped with my hyperpigmentation and evened out my skin tone. It does not dry out my skin but leaves it feeling baa by soft. I apply it and lesser on for ten minutes then rinse with cool water, pat dry with paper towel. I have only used this soap for three weeks and I already see improvement. I am woman of color and shaved found this so to be very effective. Sunscreen as always afterwards.</li>
    <li> OMG love the hell out of this soap my skin feel so smooth after my 1st use today i am going to keep ordering this soap i am so addicted to my soft skin i love it..</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old, and discoloration comes with age and leaves with this soap. Friends have even commented on how my hands and my rosacea on my cheeks have all cleared up. I would recommend this soap to anyone who want a clean and fresh looking skin, and clears up redness and brown spots.</li>
    <li> Yes this soap kept my body clean, but so could any other so and for much less money. The only effect this soap had on me is that it dried out my skin. No I would not recommend this product to anyone ever.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for  a couple of months . Results are  slow but if used as directed it will show  results.</li>
    <li> I didnt trslly likr iiii</li>
    <li> The soap should be kept out of the water when finished so it doesn&#x27;t melt away and I would not recommend using it more than 2-3 times per week due to its drying properties. Also use a good moisturizer when you get out of the shower. The soap really does lighten uneven skin coloration and darker scar marks. The shipping was great as well.</li>
    <li> Not good waste of $$$!!!</li>
    <li> Honestly I Dont Know What To Say, It Burned My Skin It Left Some Parts Of My Skin Lighter And Others Darker</li>
    <li> I bought this item after reading on ehow.com that licorice root extract works well on fading dark spots.  I was getting dark patches on my face like my mother did when she was my age.  I hoped I would not get them but Oh No!!!  Anyway with my first use, I saw a difference.  The exfoliation was magnificent.  My skin squeaked. I washed my whole body, then rinsed and as I toweled off my skin was still sloughing.  So I got back in the shower and used a loofah along with the soap again.  OMG I could not believe the dead skin I must of had that I missed all this time even with using a loofah sponge!  So when I shower or bathe I wash once, rinse wait a couple minutes then wash again as this soap keeps working to exfoliate apparently after the first wash.  Now as for lightening...  I was going somewhere after my 3rd use of this soap and I put on my foundation.  I was amazed that my face had become too light for it.  I had to buy lighter make-up! All over my body I am at least a shade lighter and on my face and arms perhaps as much as 2 shades.  The only setback is you must moisturize since your skin will be striped but you should moisturize anyway right?  I bought another bar and am back for more as I do not want to be without. Oh and after my bath or shower even washing my face my nails are whitened like I scrubbed them for 10 minutes!  Even after I garden.&lt;br /&gt; Love this soap!</li>
