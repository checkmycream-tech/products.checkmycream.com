<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this every night and have had no reactions or side effects.  Only a little is needed.</li>
    <li> Product is very good. Leaves your skin moisturized without feeling greasy; reduced the visibility of wrinkles. Comments of friends of how I look says it all. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of PRODERMIS Retinol products. I usually buy the bottles in big retail stores so when I found that they sell it at a discount on Amazon I bought a couple bottles. As always, they make a great product</li>
    <li> I did not care the way it made my skin feel, almost to the point that I felt it was doing nothing for my skin moisture wise.  I spent more money for this product and got less skin value, moisture wise.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve  been using it for about 5 days now and can see improvement in the smoothness of my skin and even some of the wrinkles around my eyes seem to have diminished.  Impressive for just a few days!</li>
    <li> Feels good, easy to use and apply. Also a great size for travel&lt;br /&gt;First time for this product for me! Love it already!</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this, I got one small squirt from the pump, then nothing.  Cannot get the pump to work. Unscrewed the cap and peered in, and it seems the pump has detached itself from the stem that goes to the bottom of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I found this to be very effective.  Even my daughter noticed a big difference!</li>
    <li> The product arrived very promptly - I am very satisfied with this Retinol cream and I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I like the pro dermis retinol cream because of the fine lines I have from my age group.&lt;br /&gt;It helps smooth out those lines and enriches my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the ProDermis Retinol Night Cream for several weeks at this point and there&#x27;s a lot to like. It goes on smoothly and is light on the skin. The next morning when I wash my face the surface feels good. I didn&#x27;t really expect dramatic changes in texture or refining of lines but there is a subtle yet noticeable improvement. I&#x27;m at the age where I&#x27;d like to hold back time for a little while longer, at least the mapping of time on my face. I&#x27;ve tried lots of products that promise the moon. In general, a modestly priced generic does well enough. But I like the ProDermis product well enough to continue using it. No, it hasn&#x27;t erased the past twenty years but it is working to make my skin feel more supple and to reduce the appearance of lines. I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> 1.) Many other products leave a thick layer of chemical residue...blocking the pores of the skin...not this one.&lt;br /&gt;2.) No harsh chemical...or residue!  Pores are moisturized and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Odorless&lt;br /&gt;4.) Small portion each night works is all that is needed.&lt;br /&gt;5.) The amount in the bottle will last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;6.) The dispenser is very easy to use providing the exact portion.&lt;br /&gt;7.) Nicely designed bottle (size and shape) for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;8.) Priced so much better than other products that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;9.) I am so pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to really give it a true rating, but my skin does seem softer and smoother.  I would love to give it a rating after 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this produce just about everyday for a month.  I have noticed my wrinkles softening.  They continue to soften more each week.  My skin also seems brighter and more even.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  Keep with it, and don&#x27;t get discouraged; you will see a difference with time.</li>
    <li> The results are absolutely amazing!  I noticed real results in my skin in less than a week. I love this stuff :)</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do what it said it would do.  Kind of suspicious packaging or explanation of product not your high dollar packaging enclosed. Just another cream for the face but without the benefits of the Retinol.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this cream.  It goes on very smoothly and so far seems to be&lt;br /&gt;doing what I wanted it to do.  It arrived on time and was nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> The product came quickly when ordered. The lotion goes on great - very soft feel and nice light scent. Moisturizes wonderfully and I had no side effects like with some retinal products!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and the only changes I have seen is drier skin in the morning.  The product came with a lot of promises so I am waiting.  The cream is very light and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks so at this point I have not noticed to much of a difference.  However, I will continue to use it and I&#x27;m sure in another 2 weeks I should start seeing results.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Does not disappoint.  Excellent price too.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product for anyone that would lie to balance their skin tone.</li>
    <li> How do I get the cream out of the  \\&quot;glass\\&quot; bottle?  Please instruct me. I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s very simple.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cream but does nothing for wrinkles. Also the vendor really harrassed me about leaving a review after I repeatedly told them I had not used it long enough to comment one way or another. Now suddenly it is not available. hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy anything from this company again.</li>
    <li> i gave it 5 stars cause they are very nice  people that what  make sure they put out best items they can and they really want to be sure your happy with  their  items and with  the way your are treated and what you think</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for maybe one month. I use a magnifying mirror on a regular basis to put eye makeup on so after I wash my face and pat it dry I put very little retinol cream &amp;#34;that&#x27;s all you need&amp;#34; where I see fine lines when looking in the magnifying mirror. Like I said I&#x27;ve only used it a short time but the fine lines do look better. Can&#x27;t expect creams to work over night takes time. It&#x27;s sure worth a try since you can return it if your not pleased. Remember it takes time.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t given the retinol long enough time to see much of a difference. So far  I  think there is a little reduction of fine lines around my eyes. I will continue to use the product and will give you a more in depth review after I use it a while longer. It was priced right and was shipped quickly and I received it in 2 Days.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I feels wonderful on the skin.  Not greasy, doesn&#x27;t burn, and when you wak up your skin feels soft and rejuvenated.  Just a wonderful product.  I would recommend this product to any woman who want to keep her skin feeling soft and beautiful!</li>
    <li> I have older and thinner skin so this did not work for me.  I tried it for a time but found it dried my skin out too much.  I gave it to m daughter who has had some luck with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about two weeks..I definitely like&amp; recommend..What i&#x27;ve found so far to my liking is a much clearer skin, more vibrant, healthier &amp; younger looking.It has also helped diminish my acne scars..Its not greasy so its perfect under makeup as well.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! Need I say more? It is WONDERFUL. My skin feels young again. I will use it forever.</li>
    <li> i just started using this product a few days ago.. so far i see just a mimimal difference in my skin tone. i will keep you updated as i&lt;br /&gt;use it</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few weeks at night.  The cream is very light and I wonder if it is doing anything.  I haven&#x27;t had any bad reaction, so  skin has adapted.  I will keep using it, but not sure I would reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V. E. Jordan Southard</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand, I bought all the products Dr oz episode for cellulite on back of legs used it accordingly and I don&#x27;t have that much on me not one product worked I&#x27;m very disappointed. It was worth a try. Thank u. Cindy</li>
    <li> The product came in good time in the mail and so far I really like it a lot.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to make a really good review on it though.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased with the product,  the delivery was on time.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and have been pleased with the effect&lt;br /&gt;of the cream.  I would recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I love the Prodermis products and will continue to use them.  My skin feels amazing and looks better after just a few weeks!!</li>
    <li> Felt the tightening of my skin. Really feel the improvement and the pores are tighter. I really like it. I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use every day. But so far so good.</li>
    <li> Really can&#x27;t say any wrinkles have gone away, but my husband keeps telling me how good my face and hands look (yes, I use alittle on the top of my hands at night) anyway, I have to admit my skin does look better and it&#x27;s nice that he even noticed it (he must tell me every or every other day how nice my face looks without make-up and this is a guy who doesn&#x27;t even notice if I have a hair growing out on my chin!!! ha ha  By all means buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2EFD7LP2MX2J4]]I love the cream. I have been using it a couple of weeks and my skin feels great! I have sensitive skin but this cream is great, its not too oily or not to dry and I can already see a smoother complexion.</li>
    <li> The only face cream I use! I ran of without ordering more WILL NOT make that mistake again!</li>
    <li> My PRoDermis arrived and I&#x27;m eager to try it out.  I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m little apprehensive. I tried Retinol when it first came out  and had a bad reaction to it. It has taken me years to give it a second chance . But it was wonderful. Not the least bit harsh. I have used it for a week now and I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product because it leaves my face so soft and actually makes it look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use amazons hyluronic acid before this moisturizer and it seems to last longer. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I am delighted with the Retinol Cream.  My skin is oily and to my surprise, this product is NOT oily!&lt;br /&gt; It leaves my skin smooth and beautiful.  Would you have a skin cleanser and toner for oily skin?&lt;br /&gt;E-Mail me if you have a full line.  Thank you for this product opportunity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for four days, but my face already looks and feels tighter and the lines are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with the Organic Vit C Serum b/c I wanted a moisturizer but I also wanted one that worked at night than just sat on my face.  I have used Retinol in the past and found it to be very irritating to my skin but tolerable b/c I liked the results. Using the two together, this one at night and the other one in the morning, well, my results have been noticeably amazing.  I have even started to apply it to areas on my neck and sun spots on my arm.  I am fair skin, 45, and with some sun damage and some tiny lines around my eyes, and after using both for 3 weeks, the sun spots are noticeably lighter, lines are finer, and my skin looks brighter.  I would highly recommend this product.  My skin is also sensitive and I haven&#x27;t noticed redness, dryness or any peeling, which I like, although that is characteristic of Retinol, so this must be a lower % than what I used in the past.  I recommend it and would order it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this a few weeks.  I see a difference already.  I have also been receiving compliments.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real changes to the acne scarring I have or to the fine wrinkles. They all appear the same to me, though I do like the softness of the cream. I wear it every night. I won&#x27;t return it, too much of a hassle. I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone or I find something else that works better.</li>
    <li> Not really a good Retinol cream.  the only thing that is nice is it does soak into the skin.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough&lt;br /&gt;and I will continue until finished.  I have not seen or felt any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Have only been using a few days and have not had any adverse effects, so hopefully I will see some positive change in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> really do like it. makes your skin feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time ( even sooner than I was expecting)&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it for couple of weeks and I like it!</li>
    <li> RESULTS ARE EQUAL TO MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, product was as advertised.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really have not seen any difference at all, kinda of disappointed with the product but will hive it another week to see</li>
    <li> I have not used the cream for the recommended 30 days yet, but I need to use another cream with it since it doesn&#x27;t seem rich enough for my skin.  I am older so my skin tends to be dry.  So far I have not noticed much difference in my skin.  It also took longer than expected to receive this item.</li>
    <li> 2ND ORDER AND LOVE IT!  I ACTUALLY PURCHASED JUST THE MOISTURIZER THE FIRST TIME. I WAS SO PLEASED SO THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THE SERUM AS WELL. A WONDERFUL PRODUCT, AND AM SEEING RESULTS ALREADY. TRY IT, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> so glad you sent the e mail we did not now where to reorder if we wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;So far everything is good</li>
    <li> I was very impressed by the product and the price.  I find that higher-end products aren&#x27;t always the best.  I noticed changes in my skin texture immediately</li>
    <li> My skin is softer, firmer and those pesky old lines are softening more each day!  After trying ever so many products, I can see and feel the difference with Prodermis Retinol Night Cream.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It took me a few days to use the product after I received it, but I so far I like it.  No complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Feels creamy and smooth on my skin, a little tingley...&lt;br /&gt;Just received product so have not tried it for a week yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with how quickly the product was delivered! The cream is wonderful, glides on smooth and after two weeks of constant applications I see major improvements! Thank you prodermis!</li>
    <li> great product, highly recommend. you can feel it tighten your skin as it dries. i used it day and night but its worth the money.</li>
    <li> I received the product on time as promised, however I&#x27;m only halfway through the jar, and haven&#x27;t seen any difference. But I&#x27;ll keep using this product in hopes that I will.</li>
    <li> Buying this product is just a waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> All my life I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to have very smooth, pink youthful skin.  Now that I&#x27;m in my early 50s my skin has started to show a little age, ok maybe more than a little.  The very fine lines I was developing were becoming deeper, my skin wasn&#x27;t as fresh looking and I was getting a lot of wrinkles around my eyes.  For the most part I&#x27;ve taken care of my skin and worn sunscreen however, there were times that I&#x27;d forget the sunscreen and end up with a burn.  Up until the last couple of years I thought those burns didn&#x27;t have an effect on my skin but now I&#x27;m thinking they must have.  I did quite a bit of research on which were the best products so I could get the best bang for my buck.  This particular brand of Retinol was the right price and had the ingredients I was looking for.  So far I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and my skin is beginning to get that glow back again. I realize that at the age of 53 I&#x27;m going to have some age show on my face I just don&#x27;t want to look washed out and dried up.  A few wrinkles shows how wise you are, more than a few shows your real age.  So If you&#x27;re looking for a good product that is reasonably priced I would try the PRoDERMIS Retinol Night Creme. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the cream for very long yet, but noticed my pores already look smaller.  Will give it a few months to see if I see any changes in the fine lines or the dark wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints after using this cream, but I also can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference after using the entire bottle.  That being said, it is well known that it takes 12 weeks to notice a difference in skin after using retinol creams.  It is not a miracle, but it does have a nice light feel and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this cream for a couple weeks.  It&#x27;s too soon to comment on the results but I will say the cream feels great on my face.  It&#x27;s rich and creamy but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or too heavy on my face.</li>
    <li> Just ordered again for the 3rd time.  I am 51 ,Ordered 6 months before my daughters wedding tying to work on my wrinkles and skin tone.  I could feel it my face feeling tighter with in a week.  Still working great and not too strong but really works.  I would highly recommend this porduct!!</li>
    <li> While I have only used this product for under two weeks it has made a difference in my skin. I plan to make it part of my nightly facial regime</li>
    <li> Excellent. Enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I like it and when I purchase this the price was good.  With all the products I have tried I truly believe there is nothing on the market tor help wrinkles and old age.  My fun days are over. This product was between a 3 and a 4 because as a cream it is really nice. If I see it for a good price again I will re order.</li>
    <li> The product was received promptly.  I have only used it for a couple of day and I have noticed that my face is much softer.  The Retinol Cream seem to be working as stated.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful retinol cream. I have been using for over a month and started seeing the lines in my forehead less and less noticeable. This was my target area and this is doing the job! The cream is lasting as you need just a small amount and it has a most pleasant fragrance. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to try, and only got to try a handful of times cause the pump broke and was nearly impossible to get out. The cream felt like plain moisturizer to me. Nothing special. Not even a little like ANY retinol cream I have used before.</li>
    <li> thanks....since I just recently receive the product it is too soon to give a review at this time....will do so at a later date at least after using one container of your product and see how it turns out...ok</li>
    <li> I like  this product alot! especially how it makes my skin soft and is helping even out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a couple weeks ago along with Pro Dermis and Vit. C  Serum and  Collagen Cream.  Feels great on your skin.  Makes it really soft.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it will work for me in fighting wrinkles.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I just received my product and I am looking forward to some positive changes in my skin......especially evening out the skin tone.</li>
    <li> It is a little bit thick in texture but keep the moist well while you sleep, but I would not buy without the discount for sure. Not that worthy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have tried some of the more costly serums and creams, and not had the results that this product gave me.  I used it (at first) for the dark spots here and there on my face that I hated.  I did not really care about the rest of the advertising for lessening of fine lines, creating a more luminous look, etc.  I also did not expect to see much in the way of results for at least a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I found the texture and feel of the cream wonderful, and in about the first 2 weeks, I also found that some of the lighter spots were already fading.  By the time I had used it every night for about 6 weeks, almost all of the spots had faded to near invisibility, my skin looked brighter, felt smoother, and I did notice that some of the fine line around my mouth and eyes had smoothed out - laugh line, not frown lines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and suggest you try it.  Use it only at night, and wear some sun screen during the day, since there is retinol in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week now and can already tell a difference in my skin tone.  It does leave a slight tingle after applying and one night I applied a little too close to my eye area which left a burning feeling, so definitely follow their directions and leave the eye area alone!!!  I will keep using!!!</li>
    <li> Cannot comment since I have use the product for a week and I have seen no change yet</li>
    <li> Was holding back on reviewing this product, to see if it really works or not.  If not, I knew there was a 100% guarantee or money back.  Well, it&#x27;s been 2 weeks, and this cream has made a remarkable difference on the back of my arms. I have Keratosis Pilaris (bumps).  so after researching what I could use, I know Vitamin A works well, but taking it internally is risky, as it builds up in your system, and could cause other symptoms much worse than bumps on my skin!.&lt;br /&gt;So I googled Vit. A cream, and found this.  It was the least expensive, and like i said came with a guarantee, so I tried it.  I will be reordering, it&#x27;s a small jar, but it works..&lt;br /&gt;The seller has emailed me twice asking if I was satisfied, did I have any issues with my order....yes, satisfied very much, it came quickly, and no isues with my order.  Good product, good price, great customer support.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Looks and feels very good. Small wrinkles go away soon after use.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very quickly and although I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for the effects to take place, I am using it now every night, along with the serum, and hoping for great results soon! The nigh cream feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> I really liked it. Not greasy, not a overwhelming scent. I am starting to see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any real difference.</li>
    <li> this is a great skin with retinol. My skin is the best. Try it, you will love it. great price.</li>
    <li> I have been using other moisturizers such Mary Kay, but can actually tell a difference in wrinkles, a more even complexion and softness of my skin using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks.  It is very nice for under your makeup, and before bed.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and so far I love it! I think I can already notice a difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> So far I like the cream. My face seems smoother and pores are smaller in my trouble areas.  I have noticed some improvement with fine lines as well and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used the Obagi nuderm system obtained from my doctor for almost a year.  I was reluctant to use this product but the ease of use made so much scents.  I was running out of my retinol cream so I purchased this.  It is fabulous.  I use it with my Obagi system and am enjoying the ease of applying the retinol as this cream is very silky and glides right on.  I would recommend this product for anyone using retinol.  The price was also a factor and more than worth the switch.  Thank you for this product.  I am well pleased.</li>
    <li> For once something did do as expected!!!  I truly appreciate the fact that it did as stated and I don&#x27;t have to send it back for lack of  performance (which they asked us to do) .  Try it for yourselves and see,  you can always return it, but I didn&#x27;t .</li>
    <li> I like this and I bought it while on a special offer for $9.95.  I would buy it again at that price but not higher.  I have only been using it for a short while.  So far, it isn&#x27;t blowing out any other cream I use.  If they offer it again at $9.95, I will buy.  Unless I see dramatic results as I continue to use it, I won&#x27;t pay more.  All in in all, it is a good product but too pricey at regular price or even on sale for $19.95.</li>
    <li> Nice light whipped feel that&#x27;s rapidly observed, however skin looked WORSE after 2 weeks of use.  Over all I am not satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the cream will actually work, but after 2 uses, the pump didn&#x27;t work and I can&#x27;t get the cream out of the bottle, so ....</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now.  I have very sensitive skin and am acne-prone, and also have acne scarring.  I have tried many other retinol products and they are either too strong or not strong enough and greasy.  This product has really helped with my skin texture.  I also use it on my neck, where I have noticed the greatest difference.  I would highly recommend this, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended using a retinal night cream after having some cancer removed from my face.This is the best one I have used so far, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Someone complimented on how bright my skin looked. But it took using it on my upper arms, chest, neck and face only a month before I ran out of it. It definitely helped with my break outs on my upper arms. I can feel that the little zits are gone.</li>
    <li> Great product. It came really quick and i have only used it for a week but i have noticed a small change in my face like softness and my skin glowing.</li>
    <li> In the week I have been using this product I have NOT noticed any difference in the cellulite in my thighs.  I will finish the product and will try something else.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately,  I was not happy with this product.  I used it everyday and did not see any improvements at all.  I have a few days left and I will continue using it because I don&#x27;t want to waste my money.  I doubt i will see results.  Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Not a very good product. Don&#x27;t get fooled by the price. Real retinol is not that inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the results</li>
    <li> I just started to use my Retinol cream and I feel my skin softer.  I like the way the seller  was very helpful  giving you some tips for your skin  I sure recommend this seller.  I also will recomend any woman to start using retinol as early as possible. Thanks</li>
    <li> Did not work for me, I do not believe there is any cream out there, that can help with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I just purchase the cream delivery was very fast, I started using it on 06/25/2014  I can&#x27;t say much about it yet I have to wait and then I will sent a review about the cream the cream is creamy and absorbs on the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> As far as the delivery of this product (Retinol Cream) I am very satisfied that I received my product on time. I would rate this a Five star. As to if this product is as good as you said, its too soon to tell. Will I order this product again?  It&#x27;s too soon to tell.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;cynthia Armstrong</li>
    <li> Im not using this item for a long time.  But for the week I am using it no reactions but too soon to see results.  Service was great.</li>
    <li> The cream works wonders. A great product.  The items was sent out and received on time!</li>
    <li> Good product and it arrived quickly. Nice customer service, as well</li>
    <li> Its going to take about a year to see any results, magic does not work at my age.  Thank you, I am using hoping to remove a few sun spots.</li>
    <li> Still trying to decide if product is doing what I want.</li>
    <li> Light and non greasy? I use it daily.</li>
