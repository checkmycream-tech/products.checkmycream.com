      <li>I am not an easy sell</li>
      <li>I am used to the peptide face cream, i did not like the antioxidant face cream I did not feel comfortable using the cream..</li>
      <li>and I really enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>These are all supposed to help smooth wrinkles, soften, refine and rejuvenate your skin, which it seems to do.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spend so much more on others and thought it&#x27;s worth a try for the price...</li>
      <li>I notice a significant difference VS when I just use the Alpha Hydrox Cream.  </li>
      <li>This is the best face cream I have ever used &amp; this includes many much more expensive ones.</li>
      <li>Thus far however, I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich and thick and leaves my face feeling wonderful.  </li>
      <li>It is true to its words.</li>
      <li>I know a good amount about facial creams, having tried 100s over the years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this face cream for at least 2 years, and it&#x27;s the best!  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for almost 3 full months now</li>
      <li>The ingredients are top notch and the results make this cream one of my top 2 all time facial creams.  </li>
      <li>It feels silky going on your skin, and after about a week, your skin will be softer and more vibrant.</li>
      <li>This product dried up the bumps, got rid of the redness and greatly reduced creases.  </li>
      <li>I like this product very much and people have commented on how my face looks hydrated.</li>
      <li>Most likely I will use this as a foot cream till it is gone.</li>
      <li>Second time I have purchase this cream, and enjoying everyminute of the cream.</li>
      <li>The Amazon reviews seemed pretty positive, so I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic face cream that leaves the skin feeling soft and highly moisturized.</li>
      <li>Goes on a little greasy but absorbs nicely after some time.</li>
      <li>so I knew which was responsible for the results.</li>
      <li>I really like this company</li>
      <li>This face cream really seems to help my complexion.  </li>
      <li>I really like the feel of this.</li>
      <li>I do, however, apply it again at night during the hot summer months, as I need a little more moisture to carry me through the night.  </li>
      <li>Rich creamy moisture with the most recommended ingredients and none of the less essential ones.</li>
      <li>It really does more than other moisturizers (probably because it natural).</li>
      <li>i would definitely recommend this to anybody with dry skin and is looking for a good facial creme.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to what I use and never had a problem.</li>
      <li>Therefore definitely not a good under-makeup kind of creme in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The creme is thick and goes on smoothly, and my face definitely feels moisturized and smooth in the mornings.</li>
      <li>So far, this has not caused any breakouts.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and, in my opinion, works better than far more expensive, name-brand products that I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t give any scientific feedback but love that the ingredients are clean and don&#x27;t include anything that is dangerous for your skin.  </li>
      <li>The scent seemed pretty heavy to me, but of course that&#x27;s all relative.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick yet blends into my skin quickly, and it keeps my face hydrated all day.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s thick yet blends into my skin quickly, and it keeps my face hydrated all day.  </li>
<li> My dry skin chin which I&#x27;ve had for a few years is now gone thanks to this powerful dense thick facial cream.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb all that quickly; even with just a thin layer about 20-30 minutes before bed, my face still sticks to the pillow a bit.</li>
<li> I use this every other eve as my final layer so to speak.</li>
<li> First the cream is like mud very thick.</li>
<li> (he never uses lotion, but he was so dry he used this)!</li>
<li> The container seems small, but that creme goes a long way, so I suspect this little jar will last me several months.</li>
<li> Took about 2-3 weeks of daily use before the dried skin issue went away.  </li>
<li> I use it morning and night along with other creams that are nutritious for my skin and will use it the rest of my life.  </li>
<li> Greasy and thick but this with the cleanser and serum left my skin and my husband&#x27;s skin blotchy and irritated.</li>
<li> This is one of the first face cremes/moisturizers I have tried, so unfortunately I have very little to compare it to.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m skeptical about any new product until I try it.  </li>
<li> This crème is a little heavy</li>
<li> waited to do this review because I wanted to test a Few products I purchased.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a heavy cream but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your face.</li>
<li> Be prepared for some dried patches on your skin in some cases, but stick with it.  </li>
<li> It went away after using this face cream for a few weeks.  </li>
<li> An additional bonus is that it seems to have softened small wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes, which makes me look a tad younger and less tired.</li>
<li> The real reason it was useless to me, though, was that it was very thick and made me break out.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s small size.</li>
<li> This cream has a lot of the same ingredients that very expensive creams have, but for a lot less $</li>
<li> If this is too thick for your liking, dampen face and then apply small amount.</li>
<li> This just feels very heavy and thick.</li>
<li> I is a little too expensive though.  </li>
<li> The cream is very thick.</li>
<li> Seriously - you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  </li>
<li> And then since we only stopped using the soap, it made him break out terribly</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this face cream for at least 2 years, and it&#x27;s the best!  (I apply it immediately after my morning shower).  It&#x27;s thick yet blends into my skin quickly, and it keeps my face hydrated all day.  I do, however, apply it again at night during the hot summer months, as I need a little more moisture to carry me through the night.  I hope this product never goes off the market.</li>
    <li> Nice cream, good price.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this face cream after using it for a couple of weeks.  I have noticed that the wrinkles at the top of my lips have disappeared and my face does appear to look smoother.  I like the creaminess and the orange smell is nice.  I plan to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of face creams and this is my favorite.  It&#x27;s rich and thick and leaves my face feeling wonderful.  I had a red spot on my chin for months.  It went away after using this face cream for a few weeks.  I recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream I have ever used &amp; this includes many much more expensive ones. Try it!</li>
    <li> Seriously - you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  It&#x27;s especially good in the winter when skin tends to be drier.</li>
    <li> If this is too thick for your liking, dampen face and then apply small amount. I have oily skin and I really enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> The scent seemed pretty heavy to me, but of course that&#x27;s all relative.  I would have preferred it unscented.  The real reason it was useless to me, though, was that it was very thick and made me break out.</li>
    <li> Was expecting so much more from this after the great reviews.  I personally find it just sits on my skin to grossly roll off later in the day.</li>
    <li> I use this every other eve as my final layer so to speak. I wash with my Neutragena Microderm, then apply Hyleuronic Acid Serum/peptide, then  Alpha Hydrox 10% Glycolic Anti Wrinkle Cream &amp; ending with This Product.  I notice a significant difference VS when I just use the Alpha Hydrox Cream.  I have a Medical Background &amp; I waited to do this review because I wanted to test a Few products I purchased.  I didn&#x27;t want to use them all at the same time so I knew which was responsible for the results. i can honestly say this is a must have to my regimen!&lt;br /&gt;  I DO want to share/ mention that if you are in your 40&#x27;s &amp; are having various skin problems I would add D3 @5000 IU DAILY.  This is also an Antioxidant &amp; nourishes skin. I was getting results but adding D3 has helped a Lot more. Don&#x27;t assume you are getting plenty from the Sun.  I had mine actually tested in March &amp; it was VERY LOW!  I was prescribed &amp;#34;50,000&amp;#34; 1x a week. This helped with Acne which I never had before in my life.</li>
    <li> My dry skin chin which I&#x27;ve had for a few years is now gone thanks to this powerful dense thick facial cream. I&#x27;ve spend so much more on others and thought it&#x27;s worth a try for the price...and now I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about any new product until I try it.  This one had amazing results.  I&#x27;m a nurse, so research things before I buy.  This product did amazing things for my skin.  I&#x27;ve had red raised bumps on my face for several years.  Nothing helped.  This product dried up the bumps, got rid of the redness and greatly reduced creases.  Be prepared for some dried patches on your skin in some cases, but stick with it.  Once that&#x27;s over you will be very happy.  Took about 2-3 weeks of daily use before the dried skin issue went away.  I just ordered 2 more containers.</li>
    <li> I really like this company but this face cream is just okay in my book</li>
    <li> I am used to the peptide face cream, i did not like the antioxidant face cream I did not feel comfortable using the cream..</li>
    <li> I like this creme, it seems to go into the skin nicely.  Does not leave the skin greasy feeling or sticky after using.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic face cream that leaves the skin feeling soft and highly moisturized. Great proce for the product. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> Greasy and thick but this with the cleanser and serum left my skin and my husband&#x27;s skin blotchy and irritated. And then since we only stopped using the soap, it made him break out terribly (he never uses lotion, but he was so dry he used this)! Of course, all this was my fault. Sigh. In the garbage it went.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this cream again.First the cream is like mud very thick.Does not blend very good with skin.</li>
    <li> It works well.  I recommend it to anyone.  I is a little too expensive though.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy w/my purchase of this face creme. It is moisturizing without being greasy and it has a nice, light smell. An additional bonus is that it seems to have softened small wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes, which makes me look a tad younger and less tired. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and, in my opinion, works better than far more expensive, name-brand products that I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
    <li> I wanted to preemptive strike aging. I&#x27;ve tried Total Effects 7 and I did not feel as moisturized and supple as I do with Nutribiotic Face Creme. It feels silky going on your skin, and after about a week, your skin will be softer and more vibrant. I love this cream, and I will continue to purchase it. It really does more than other moisturizers (probably because it natural). Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> After reading some articles and blogs regarding recommended skin care by dermatologists, I found this creme with most of the those ingredients: Vit C, DMAE, Alpha Lipoic Acid, etc. The Amazon reviews seemed pretty positive, so I thought I would give it a shot. The container seems small, but that creme goes a long way, so I suspect this little jar will last me several months. The creme is thick and goes on smoothly, and my face definitely feels moisturized and smooth in the mornings. It doesn&#x27;t absorb all that quickly; even with just a thin layer about 20-30 minutes before bed, my face still sticks to the pillow a bit. Therefore definitely not a good under-makeup kind of creme in my opinion. But it is a moisturizer after all, so I tend to like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t immediately absorb/disappear. This is one of the first face cremes/moisturizers I have tried, so unfortunately I have very little to compare it to. Thus far however, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I use it at night, when I go to bed.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good moisture treatment for overnight.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give any scientific feedback but love that the ingredients are clean and don&#x27;t include anything that is dangerous for your skin.  This crème is a little heavy so I use it at night and in the winter.</li>
    <li> Nice face cream light weight and no breakouts non greasy and smells nice and light</li>
    <li> Second time I have purchase this cream, and enjoying everyminute of the cream. It is true to its words. (:</li>
    <li> Great face cream for the winter. When you skin is soooo dry this is perfect and your skin will be happy. I am very sensitive to what I use and never had a problem. It&#x27;s a heavy cream but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! This cream has a lot of the same ingredients that very expensive creams have, but for a lot less $</li>
    <li> The cream is very thick. It is ok but I would not purchase again. I have used the peptide cream and it feels like silk on my skin. This just feels very heavy and thick. Will purchase another DMAE cream. Most likely I will use this as a foot cream till it is gone.</li>
    <li> This face cream really seems to help my complexion.  It evens out my skin tone as well as tightens up my skin.  I love that it contains Lipoic Acid, DMAE, Vitamin E Ester &amp; Tocotrienol.  These are all supposed to help smooth wrinkles, soften, refine and rejuvenate your skin, which it seems to do.  I have been using it for almost 3 full months now and I will continue to use it.  It is a really great product.</li>
    <li> Rich creamy moisture with the most recommended ingredients and none of the less essential ones. I appreciate that and love this cream!</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this. i would definitely recommend this to anybody with dry skin and is looking for a good facial creme.</li>
    <li> Good seller, excellent description and good price.</li>
    <li> I am not an easy sell and I am thrilled to have found this lotion which is extraordinary for my face and neck.  I know a good amount about facial creams, having tried 100s over the years.  Since using this cream:  my wrinkles have eased, my skin is glowing, the skin around my eyes looks refreshed, my pores look smaller, my skin feels softer and I am getting a Lot of compliments on my facial skin.  The ingredients are top notch and the results make this cream one of my top 2 all time facial creams.  I use it morning and night along with other creams that are nutritious for my skin and will use it the rest of my life.  Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> So far, this has not caused any breakouts. Goes on a little greasy but absorbs nicely after some time. I use it as a night moisturizer because of the time it takes to absorb- and it&#x27;s small size.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on reviews and the price. I like this product very much and people have commented on how my face looks hydrated.</li>
