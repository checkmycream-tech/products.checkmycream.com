      <li>If you need a strong hold, look to Joico Ice Gel.</li>
      <li>I needed something with a strong hold.</li>
      <li>It must be good, because they all requested new bottles for their stockings.</li>
      <li>Product is fine, it is just the misrepresentation that is problematic.</li>
      <li>I purchased off Amazon because of the good price, he seems to go through it fairly quickly but really likes it</li>

      <li>It gives good hold and like noted in the title, no white flakes at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>but I always come back to American Crew because it has the best performance.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t watch their bathroom routines, but their hair always looks nice, never wet or crunchy or</li>
      <li>That leaves the product you used yesterday along with a nights worth of &#x27;sleeping&#x27; in your hair.  </li>

      <li>Great gel, holds my hair well and my hair is thick.</li>

      <li>Provides good hold but leaves the hair too hard.</li>
      <li>Smells great, decent sized bottle that should last a while, and holds hair pretty firmly.</li>
      <li>That said on the downside, it&#x27;s not all that sticky and really doesn&#x27;t hold all that well...</li>
      <li>you really just don&#x27;t know what you are going to get anymore.</li>
      <li>Keeps my long fine hair straight but not locked in place.</li>
      <li>Bought my son a bottle, he likes it better than so of the other foofoo smelling ones.</li>

      <li>3-5x the price of what I normally buy.</li>
      <li>I still have some left in my old bottle, so when I go out to a club and want the real stuff I still use that, and I use this basically for when I go to work every day because I don&#x27;t care as much about impressing anyone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well be ordering again! The product was recommended to me by my hair stylist. Love it because it doesn&#x27;t flake, and not to hard when it sets up, smells great too!</li>
    <li> Great product and transaction, will use again when I need it again. That&#x27;s all I have to say at this time.</li>
    <li> Great Hair Product - Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It has a pleasant smell and good hold. Keeps my long fine hair straight but not locked in place. No frizz which is exactly what I was looking for in a gel.</li>
    <li> I am a loyal user of American Crew products having used them for the past 10 years or so. Typically I use American Crew Fibre but wanted to try something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on usually semi-dry (towel dried) to mostly-dry hair and was surprised to how hard my hair got. Having come from using a paste to a gel was a bit different for me from American Crew. The hold was pretty good but due to my hair dryness it is hard for me to get an even look in my hair since some parts seem harder than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to go back to using my Fibre since the hard hair isn&#x27;t for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Figured I&#x27;d save some money and but online. Same stuff that I&#x27;ve been using. Not sure why I saw that it was different.</li>
    <li> Great hair gel with firm hold and smells good too. Bought my son a bottle, he likes it better than so of the other foofoo smelling ones. It has a good masculine scent.</li>
    <li> Barber told me to start looking into using gels for my hair cause I needed something with a strong hold. While I wait for the barber to get more stock on the ones they use, I decided to give this a shot. I like the smell, but it just does not provide a &amp;#34;firm hold&amp;#34; at all. Hair starts falling in just 15 minutes after applying. I&#x27;ve tried putting on wet hair, towel dried, and completely dry hair. All same results.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to people with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Only gel I can use that doesnt leave a nasty residue or dry out my scalp.</li>
    <li> So we have all had days where for one reason or another you can not wash your hair. That leaves the product you used yesterday along with a nights worth of &#x27;sleeping&#x27; in your hair.  Well this Crew GEL is so great you love the way your hair feels and looks and on those days when you &#x27;double up&#x27;. Anyway you will love this stuff, its worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and I&#x27;ve been using this gel and ONLY this gel since I was about 21. I know it well. The best way I can explain what I received was it seemed \\&quot;watered down.\\&quot; It is definitely not a firm hold. It smells almost like the original but not quite. It&#x27;s an obvious imitation. I still have some left in my old bottle, so when I go out to a club and want the real stuff I still use that, and I use this basically for when I go to work every day because I don&#x27;t care as much about impressing anyone. Beware!</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a stocking stuffer for my son, It is the only gel he will use.  Good transaction. nice.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of gels, and have come back to this one.  It gives good hold and like noted in the title, no white flakes at the end of the day.  It also has a nice soft fragrance which is good for a guy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve put a little gel in my hair since I realized it was cool in 1999.  Before that I actually used hair spray to control my mane *shudder*.  I started out using cheap gel like LA Look.  I could get the firm hold I wanted but It would flake like crazy.  I looked like I was either just in a snow storm or my scalp was falling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the recommendation of the lady that cut my hair, I tried American Crew Firm Hold in 2003.  It was more expensive than the LA Look stuff but remarkably better.  It had a better hold, much better smell, and best of all, no flakes.  I could wear black again and not feel like I needed to reach for some Head and Shoulders.  I&#x27;ve tried a few salon branded gels since then but I always come back to American Crew because it has the best performance.  Plus chicks dig the smell.</li>
    <li> Great gel, holds my hair well and my hair is thick. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> My oldest three teenage boys use this daily in their hair. It must be good, because they all requested new bottles for their stockings. I don&#x27;t watch their bathroom routines, but their hair always looks nice, never wet or crunchy or that &amp;#34;helmet head&amp;#34; look. Even though it&#x27;s a firm hold gel, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me like they have &amp;#34;doctored up&amp;#34; their hair. Of course, I cut their hair from home, and they all wear it very short. I think the longest one is a 10 (Wahl clippers) on top. I don&#x27;t know how it would compare on someone with longer hair, but it&#x27;s a perfect product for them so far.</li>
    <li> I have used &amp;#34;Crew&amp;#34; for many years and still use this after 13 years. Though I do toggle between this and their pomade or fiber products too.</li>
    <li> Provides good hold but leaves the hair too hard. I know that may be expected from gel, but there are other products out there that provide strong hold and allow you to run your fingers through your hair (e.g. [[ASIN:B004INEX3U L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Line Melting Gel, Strong Hold, 6.8 Fluid Ounce]]). It&#x27;s very difficult to create an even look with this product.</li>
    <li> I was too lazy to stop by the local store for this stuff, so I bought it here for the same price. Why not? Oh, and this stuff makes you look like a stud (when applied correctly).</li>
    <li> This is the best gel I&#x27;ve ever used. Strong hold without being too stiff. Hair looks great. Hold lasts a long time -- more than a day.</li>
    <li> The gel is wonderful, however, I was expecting it to come in a bottle as it&#x27;s pictured online.  The gel came in a tube instead, no big deal, it&#x27;s just that my husband prefers the bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells great, decent sized bottle that should last a while, and holds hair pretty firmly. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a stiff hold, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I had always used herbal essences strong hold gel, but I&#x27;ve always been interested to try to the American Crew equivalent, given that it&#x27;s 5x the cost of what I usually get. Well, I decided to take the $10 splurge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it worked great, although, I&#x27;m not sure it worked any better than the herbal essences strong hold gel which I would normally use. I certainly don&#x27;t think the high price is justified, although I can&#x27;t say I have any other complaints besides that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just a placebo effect, but I feel like if I was offered a choice between this or the herbal essences strong hold gel, I would choose this. These both tend to be less sticky (dries quick), and less plastic looking than other products on the market. This product didn&#x27;t seem watered down as far as I could tell.</li>
    <li> They come in tube not in bottle as show on picture</li>
    <li> Hey. It works and was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This product is great, good smell, good hold all day long. Even the price is fair! I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT HOLD WORTH CRAP! DO NOT BUY...VERY WATERY AND RUNNY. This should not be called, &amp;#34;Firm Hold.&amp;#34; That is false and misleading. If you need a strong hold, look to Joico Ice Gel. That stuff is no messing around. This on the other hand is just like water.</li>
    <li> Five stars for the scent and how clean it is. It does not not leave a sticky residue behind. That said on the downside, it&#x27;s not all that sticky and really doesn&#x27;t hold all that well...</li>
    <li> The bottle was displayed on your site got the tube instead which is useless product just pours out when opened poor design will never buy the tube. If tube was displayed would not have bought.</li>
    <li> I purchased off Amazon because of the good price, he seems to go through it fairly quickly but really likes it so I purchased at cheaper price offline. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite gel and he was excited that it came in such a large tube where he&#x27;d only had smaller ones in the past. This product is great. Doesn&#x27;t leave flakes early in wear. He has very short hair.</li>
    <li> seems to be okay.  Slight odor, that is okay.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used Crew for years for the cost.  Seems hard when you have a family to justify 20 dollars when the others are 4 but I tell you the quality is there and it does a great job slicking your hair and staying in place.</li>
    <li> Hair stays in place and I have it on good, daily authority that the world&#x27;s hungriest golden retriever can&#x27;t pierce the bottle if you leave the bathroom door open.</li>
    <li> have been using this product since I was around 20 I am now 33... The smell is off the hold is stiffer it feels stickier pretty sure this was filled with a cheaper hair gel. things like this are the reason I am starting to use amazon less and less. you really just don&#x27;t know what you are going to get anymore. I mean its obviously a different product inside the bottle than what is being advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, although pricey.&lt;br /&gt;This product will keep your hair in place in the most windy of conditions.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Was advertised as being in a bottle, arrived as a tube.  Product is fine, it is just the misrepresentation that is problematic.</li>
    <li> Typical gel. Like any other gel. Probably not worth the markup for the brand. But I guess its just personal preference.</li>
    <li> For many years I bought hair gel on the basis of cheapest cost per ounce for maximum hold. My stylist recommended this product but I hesitated because it&#x27;s 3-5x the price of what I normally buy. I decided to give it a shot, and I am pleased with the results. It holds better and looks more natural than the cheap stuff. There&#x27;s no \\&quot;pasted down\\&quot; look to my hair. As for the 5x price difference-- well, with my short hair the 8.45oz bottle lasts for several months of daily usage. That makes the cost differential irrelevant.</li>
    <li> Great product. Has protein enriched vitamins so doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, but in turn helps revitalize it. I&#x27;ve been using Crew for over 10 years, mostly on a regular daily basis. I can honestly say the gel has never damaged my hair even once and doesn&#x27;t leave any side effects to your hair. Great product, best in its competition of hair gels. Steal of a deal for under $10!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. Its a great product I use it every day when I wake up and go to work.</li>
    <li> Decent product, shipped as advertised.</li>
</ol>
