<li> The only problem is that the 1oz does not last very long when you are using it daily.  </li>
<li> It is soothing on the rash, but for long runs, it is back to body glide for me!</li>
<li> Makes your skin matte and dry.</li>

<li> The makeup companies add a few extra additional &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients after these to make it seem healthier.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I spent 4 hours walking around in a mall and had no \\&quot;issues\\&quot; at all!</li>
<li> Very similar to &amp;#34;Velvet Skin Coat&amp;#34; made by DHC, but far less expensive.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m trying to drop about 30 lbs while dealing with arthritic knees that make exercising pretty painful.  </li>
<li> it dries immediately, there is no strong smell, it prevents chafing, there are no negatives of any sort - \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; to the makers of Lanacane&#x27;s Anti-Chafing Gel!!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I sweat a lot - this product did the preventing job for me.  1 OZ is not enough for the 3-4 times a week runner.</li>
    <li> Living on a tropical island I deal with constant heat and humidity.  Working outdoors or out in the yard in these conditions on a daily basis makes chafing a constant issue.  I was skeptical but recieved a sample and have to say this is THE BEST product out there.  Goes on dry and silky and really protective of your skin.  The only problem is that the 1oz does not last very long when you are using it daily.  Lanacane needs to make a larger and more economical size.</li>
    <li> Use this as primer for makeup as its ingredients are the same as the top primers. The makeup companies add a few extra additional &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients after these to make it seem healthier. This does just about the same as the top brands where you&#x27;d pay $20-35 per tube. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I usually love Amazon, however I just found this product at Rite Aid for $6.99</li>
    <li> I wish this were available in stores in my area.  After checking out about 4 drug stores and Target, I gave up and ordered it online.  Also wish Lanacane made it in a bigger, more economical tube.  I&#x27;m trying to drop about 30 lbs while dealing with arthritic knees that make exercising pretty painful.  And my biggest pet peeve is having my thighs rub together when I wear shorts, my skin gets irritated. I&#x27;ve tried lotions and powders, but this stuff really is amazing and does the trick.  Thanks, Lanacane!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how great this product worked!  I wish I knew about it sooner.  I spent 4 hours walking around in a mall and had no \\&quot;issues\\&quot; at all!</li>
    <li> I ordered this gel (with my fingers crossed) for my husband who wears blue jeans and does a lot of walking on his job - he works at SeaTac Airport in Seattle, and on some days has to walk the entire length of the airport 2 to 3 times to manage various construction projects - he&#x27;s a large man and his thighs took a beating on these long walks, the chafing was causing him a lot of pain - he encouraged me to write this review, and let everyone know that this stuff is FANTASTIC!  We are so grateful for a product that does exactly what it says it does...it dries immediately, there is no strong smell, it prevents chafing, there are no negatives of any sort - \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; to the makers of Lanacane&#x27;s Anti-Chafing Gel!!!  &#x3D;) [[ASIN:B002YD7VGW Original Lanacane Anti-Chafing Gel, 1-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> This product works very very well in places I will never tell, so if your chubby and your legs rubby get lanacane anti chafing gel</li>
    <li> Great where it is hot and humid</li>
    <li> I tried this when I was out of body glide, since it was at my drugstore. For 3-5 mile runs, it was fine. But when I did a 9 mile last weekend...not so much. I came out of it with a rash! It is soothing on the rash, but for long runs, it is back to body glide for me!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Lanacane a while back, and for some reason, I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  I found it here, and this is where I will purchase it from now on because the price is great.  I love this product because you don&#x27;t need a glob of it for it to work, and it doesn&#x27;t leave behind any grease or powder.  Sure, baby powder is good for AFTER the chafe, but Lanacane Anti-Chafing Gel PREVENTS the chafe!  It also helps sooth and heal chafe that occurs in places that you miss!  I live in Florida, so I use it on a daily basis in the summer simply because you can&#x27;t do anything without sweating, and if you do it long enough - you chafe!  Works for me!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I recently started training for a 5K and I heard that it was a good product to keep on hand.  I haven&#x27;t seen any chafing so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s doing its job pretty well.</li>
    <li> Works. Makes your skin matte and dry.</li>
    <li> Got this for my Son-in-Law while he was doing a tour in Iraq, and he said just what he needed.</li>
    <li> This is the best  product I have ever used to prevent chaffing and ease the soreness, if anyone has a problem of skin rubbing on skin, or jeans that has cause a tender spot, this is what to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY GEL THAT REALLY WORKS WELL FOR ME. IT&#x27;S NOT GREASY AND YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE BIT OF THE PRODUCT TO DO THE JOB.  I HAVE USED THIS FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS.  AAA+++</li>
    <li> This is a great product for anyone that has problems with chafing of the thighs or breast area. It only takes a small amount, but it really protects a large area.</li>
    <li> Works great. highly recommend this product.</li>

    <li> I use this product as a make-up primer!  It saves me a good deal of money - about 1/2 the cost of a primer - and it makes my skin smooth and soft.  Make-up goes on easily and lasts longer - a great product.</li>
    <li> Great way to reduce the discomfort of common annoyancesens like shirt collars or boot chaffing.  I have allergic reactions to certain chemicals,  especially in laundry detergents.  But the anti-chaff cream helps to reduce the rubbing and decreases the absorption of irritants.</li>
