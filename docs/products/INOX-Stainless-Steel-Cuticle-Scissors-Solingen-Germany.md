### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>These are the best cuticle scissors I have ever used!</li>
      <li>When everything was made in America and the makers took great pride in their work.</li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>Good scissors.</li>
      <li>Guess I have to spend more to get excellent quality; these are just okay.</li>
      <li>Love these!  </li>
      <li>Excellent scissors, and of course, supper fast delivery.</li>
      <li>These are absolutely superb - highly recommended.</li>
      <li>WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how many I purchased and returned or trashed.</li>
      <li>The best scissors for those little bitty nails that my grand children have!</li>
      <li>Ok but not as good as my old Henkel&#x27;s scissors.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick and easy:</li>
      <li>I lost  a similar pair that was even thinner and their very finely rounded finger holes felt more comfortable when using them.</li>
      <li>My new ones however come very close to my lost perfect old ones.</li>
      <li>Quite frankly its not as good as what I expect from German manufacturing.</li>
      <li>well worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These INOX are nearly identical except the steel is even better.</li>
      <li>First, I must tell you</li>
      <li>After a very long search I finally found the perfect pair of scissors - they are sharp, comfortable to hold - exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Especially good for clipping small bits of hangnail and skin around nails (toe and hand).</li>
      <li>Nice and sharp, but for this price I expected something more sturdy.</li>
      <li>Very well made and</li>
      <li>It scissor is not shiny and don&#x27;t look like stainless steel.</li>
      <li>The picture and description is far better than actual product.</li>
      <li>Scissors are very sharp and cut easily using either hand!  </li>
      <li>Works amazingly better than current local pharmacy brands.</li>
      <li>Feel a little light and rough but cut ok.</li>
      <li>These cut well, feel very well made, are comfortable to hold, and are very sharp.</li>
      <li>Surgical quality: sharp and precise.</li>
      <li>I forgot to purchase a new one when I was in Germany this summer, visiting family.</li>
      <li>After about 25 years my cuticle scissors got to the point where I needed a new pair.</li>
      <li>They do the job, but I wish I could find a similar pair that was straight, not curved!</li>
      <li>but I finally came to the conclusion I would have to pay that much.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve bought cheap ones and expensive ones and spent way more than $200 over the years.</li>
      <li>They look strong and well made, but they tend to split my nails a bit instead of cutting through cleanly.</li>
      <li>It is razor sharp cuts exact.</li>
      <li>First thing about these scissors:  they are very, very sharp.</li>

<li> they are still sharp enough to cut cuticles as well.</li>
<li> these small slightly curved scissors work very well</li>
<li> Ever so slightly larger than my previous over-40-yrs-old cuticle scissors, which had finally gotten loose and dull.</li>
<li> They are sharp as advertised.</li>
<li> , they are very sharp and can reach the smallest areas that you want to cut.</li>
<li> I would like this area to be a little thinner.</li>
<li> My only issue is with the cutting area.</li>
<li> You know what I mean.</li>
<li> For me, they were difficult to use with the long pointed cutting edge.</li>

    <li> Nice and sharp, but for this price I expected something more sturdy. Quite frankly its not as good as what I expect from German manufacturing.</li>
    <li> The best scissors for those little bitty nails that my grand children have!</li>
    <li> First, I must tell you I used my Revlon Cuticle Scissors for 30 years. I paid $1 for those. I thought this would be a simple purchase. WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how many I purchased and returned or trashed. I could not fathom spending $30 on cuticle scissors. It took a while but I finally came to the conclusion I would have to pay that much. First thing about these scissors:  they are very, very sharp. That&#x27;s imperative. My only issue is with the cutting area. I would like this area to be a little thinner. But after what I went through, searching, buying and returning, I have no reason to complain. These Inox Cuticle Scissors are so sturdy you would think they were made 50 years ago. You know what I mean. When everything was made in America and the makers took great pride in their work.</li>
    <li> Good scissors. Ever so slightly larger than my previous over-40-yrs-old cuticle scissors, which had finally gotten loose and dull. These cut well, feel very well made, are comfortable to hold, and are very sharp. I like them.</li>
    <li> The picture and description is far better than actual product. It scissor is not shiny and don&#x27;t look like stainless steel. I don&#x27;t recommend it to a friend.</li>

    <li> After a very long search I finally found the perfect pair of scissors - they are sharp, comfortable to hold - exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> They are sharp as advertised. For me, they were difficult to use with the long pointed cutting edge. I cut myself trying to use them. Working on improving my method.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly better than current local pharmacy brands.</li>
    <li> for over 20 years i&#x27;ve been looking for cuticle scissors that actually work. i&#x27;ve bought cheap ones and expensive ones and spent way more than $200 over the years. i kept the local thriftstore stocked for years with those things. that is until i found these. i&#x27;ve had them for a couple of years oh and i want to point out that i use them as nail scissors. i cut my fingernails and toenails with them. they are still sharp enough to cut cuticles as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I forgot to purchase a new one when I was in Germany this summer, visiting family. This is just the scissor I would have bought there. It is razor sharp cuts exact. Delivery was quick and easy: Amazon style. I would buy this product again if needed.</li>
    <li> These are the best cuticle scissors I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Love these!  Finally, a non-tearing/ripping/chewing answer to my raggedy hangnails!</li>
    <li> Guess I have to spend more to get excellent quality; these are just okay.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Surgical quality: sharp and precise.</li>
    <li> Excellent scissors, and of course, supper fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Ok but not as good as my old Henkel&#x27;s scissors. Feel a little light and rough but cut ok.</li>
    <li> They do the job, but I wish I could find a similar pair that was straight, not curved! I use them to trim facial hair as close to the surface as I can.</li>
    <li> They look strong and well made, but they tend to split my nails a bit instead of cutting through cleanly.</li>
    <li> Scissors are very sharp and cut easily using either hand!  Very well made and well worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Especially good for clipping small bits of hangnail and skin around nails (toe and hand).</li>
