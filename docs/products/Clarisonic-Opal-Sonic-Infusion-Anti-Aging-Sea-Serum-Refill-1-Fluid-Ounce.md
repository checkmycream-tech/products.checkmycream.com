      <li>:)</li>
      <li>The Clarisonic Serum is the next best thing.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I also use a bit on my top lip line.  </li>
      <li>Using this product with the Opal is so much better than just patting a product under your eyes.  </li>
      <li>My under eye area looks 110% better.</li>
      <li>but it performs much better with the Opal infuser.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love my clarisonic and my opal.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and I look noticeably more refreshed.</li>
      <li>so I was glad when the stuff wore off.  </li>
      <li>I also using around top lip.  </li>
      <li>It is a lot more taut and wrinkles are not as visible.</li>
      <li>This is a very good product for the fine lines around the eyes especially when applied with the Opal Sonic Infusion system.</li>
      <li>Just glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only averaging about once a day and still getting great results.</li>
      <li>The price for the amount of serum is great and it does work well with the Opal, better then any other cream.</li>
      <li>This Clarisonic Opal Sonic infusion Anti-aging Sea Serum refill is identical to what originally came with my Opal.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Clarisonic Anti-Aging Sea Serum for two years, and I have noticed a significant difference on the elasticity of the skin on my face.</li>
      <li>However, I think this serum isn&#x27;t terribly effective at reducing the fine lines and crows feet that appear near and around my eyes.</li>
      <li>but the magic really happens with the opal.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure, I use Sonicare for my teeth and Clarisonic brush for my face, so I&#x27;m already a fan of their products.</li>
      <li>The serum really penetrates the layers of skin for a much better result and your circles and puffiness start to diminish quickly.  </li>
      <li>It does absorb quickly.</li>
      <li>Such an amazing product.  </li>
      <li>This serum is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Worth a try.</li>
      <li>I prefer to use higher quality eye creams with my Opal device, and no longer order this Clarisonic product.  </li>
      <li>I first purchased the Clarisonic Opal on Sephora&#x27;s website, and this serum came with it.</li>
      <li>I really  love this product I use it daily with the sonic opal its not greasy and really works well.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>but for now I am thankful for this so very thankful thankful.</li>
      <li>I have tried other serums but there is no match greater than this serum and the Opal.</li>
      <li>Vitamin C for example--that provides more generally longer lasting results.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that the skin under my eyes is more hydrated now, so I&#x27;m using even less still.</li>
      <li>This product seems to be fairly effective at firming the skin and reducing the delicate, flaky looking skin under my eye area that makes my skin appear a lot older looking than it really is.</li>
      <li>and I work hard to keep my skin looking good, especially since I had lots of sun damage as a kid</li>
      <li>, I think I have a fairly clear idea of how it works and what it will do and probably won&#x27;t do...</li>
      <li>I do not have terribly sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>A bit pricey, but what natural, paraben-free mosturizer isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>People say I look better lately.</li>
      <li>This is the right product for the Opal but not real happy with the Opal.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use this with the clarisonic opal and I just love it! The serum works well alone but the magic really happens with the opal. My under eye area looks 110% better. The dark circles and puffiness instantly diminished. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and I look noticeably more refreshed. People say I look better lately. Usually I&#x27;m told I look tired. I&#x27;m also using much less concealer. This stuff is a little pricey but a little goes a long way...I have noticed that the skin under my eyes is more hydrated now, so I&#x27;m using even less still. It&#x27;s suggested that you use this twice a day...I&#x27;m only averaging about once a day and still getting great results. This serum is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Have been using for 2 years.  My eye area looks amazing. I also using around top lip.  I use it once a day in the morning.  I had botux once, which didn&#x27;t work for me so I was glad when the stuff wore off.  The Clarisonic Serum is the next best thing.  I love this stuff.  Would recommend it wholeheartedly.  My best friend uses it, too.  I get lots of compliments on how good I look.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  When applied it dries and firms and flattens the under eye skin area.  I use it on crows feet and on the outer brow bone and the under eye area religiously.  I also use a bit on my top lip line.  I am 52 and have been using this product for over 2 years. It smells like algae of course but it dries and has no odor afterward.  This quantity is less than the previous 2 bottles of serum I have purchased.  It comes with the same number, 2, of the replacement rubber tips for my Clarisonic Opal application system although it has nearly half the amount of product in the pump.  If I am in a hurry I use it on my ring finger and pat it in but it performs much better with the Opal infuser.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love my clarisonic and my opal.  this serum does work well in hydrating and making your eyes look and feel better!</li>
    <li> The price for the amount of serum is great and it does work well with the Opal, better then any other cream. Dont expect miracle but it does have an effect when used with Opal.</li>
    <li> Clarisonic products always 5 stars (except pedi which sucked.)</li>
    <li> I have been using for a 2yrs this product  I really like it&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have wrinkle under my eyes</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Difficult to find except on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product makes me look years younger along with the Opal.  I am thankful for that.  Perhaps eventually I want to look my age but for now I am thankful for this so very thankful thankful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Anti-Aging Serum for a year and I am very pleased with the result.  I can tell a difference even if I don&#x27;t use it regularly now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this refill from Amazon for my Clarisonic  Opal because of the reduced price however, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the skin around my eyes so I&#x27;m not sure if it really works.  Just glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
    <li> I had been using it for the last 5 months with Clarisonic Opal unit. I had seen the improvement after 2 weeks. It definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to all my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> I have been using Clarisonic Sea Serum for over two years and have liked the results.  What I&#x27;m mad about is that my last bottle was $65 for 1.7 ounces; this one was $65 for 1 ounc.  Frankly, that&#x27;s unbelievable and enough to cause me to pitch my Clarisonic and never buy their products again.  It just feels manipulative to me ... the package looks bigger and feels heavier but has way less product.  Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> My second usage.  I have an Opal.</li>
    <li> I prefer to use higher quality eye creams with my Opal device, and no longer order this Clarisonic product.  With its gel consistency, it does work well with the device, but I need an eye cream with a bit of added omph--Vitamin C for example--that provides more generally longer lasting results.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  My eyes are tired looking in the AM and when I use the Clarisonic Opal combined with the serum it immediately takes my fine lines and puffiness away!</li>
    <li> This product seems to be fairly effective at firming the skin and reducing the delicate, flaky looking skin under my eye area that makes my skin appear a lot older looking than it really is. However, I think this serum isn&#x27;t terribly effective at reducing the fine lines and crows feet that appear near and around my eyes. I have been using the serum and Clarisonic Opal for almost 6 months now, so, I think I have a fairly clear idea of how it works and what it will do and probably won&#x27;t do...it&#x27;s not a miracle product for aging eyes but using it twice daily has definitely improved the bags under my eyes and firmed the skin....so, I like this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it with my opal and goes on great! It is a serum. I use for crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
    <li> I really  love this product I use it daily with the sonic opal its not greasy and really works well.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product and am not quite sold on it.  It&#x27;s a maybe in my book. It does absorb quickly.</li>
    <li> This Clarisonic Opal Sonic infusion Anti-aging Sea Serum refill is identical to what originally came with my Opal. I use it at least once a day!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clarisonic Anti-Aging Sea Serum for two years, and I have noticed a significant difference on the elasticity of the skin on my face. It is a lot more taut and wrinkles are not as visible. I will continue to use it as long as it is available. A bit pricey, but what natural, paraben-free mosturizer isn&#x27;t. I first purchased the Clarisonic Opal on Sephora&#x27;s website, and this serum came with it. It was a part of the kit. I have had to replenish it  3 times, I use it day and night, twice daily. So a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this product religiously with my Opal. I have tried other serums but there is no match greater than this serum and the Opal.</li>
    <li> I think that the Opal is a great product and I like this serum. I like that this serum comes with two replacement applicator tips.</li>
    <li> This is the right product for the Opal but not real happy with the Opal.  Don&#x27;t seem to be getting any results after two months of use.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product.  I have faithfully used my Clarisonic Anti-Aging Sea Serum (in my Clarisonic Opal) for four months and now I can&#x27;t imagine my morning routine without it.  I was starting to notice bags and circles under my eyes and when I had a facial one day, the technician used this serum with the Opal under my eyes and I was hooked from that moment on.  Using this product with the Opal is so much better than just patting a product under your eyes.  The serum really penetrates the layers of skin for a much better result and your circles and puffiness start to diminish quickly.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without this product!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I can see some improvement even though I am considered a senior citizen!!! Should have used when I was younger.</li>
    <li> I have the Opal and have been very pleased with the results using the serum.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, I use Sonicare for my teeth and Clarisonic brush for my face, so I&#x27;m already a fan of their products. I&#x27;m in my 50s and I work hard to keep my skin looking good, especially since I had lots of sun damage as a kid (I&#x27;m very pale and prone to sunburns). I do not have terribly sensitive skin. (I offer this for perspective since we all have different histories.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Opal and this product. It feels like the skin around my eyes is less damaged looking. The serum leaves a film however, that doesn&#x27;t mix well with my foundation and primer (Laura Mercier), so I use my Opal at night. I get compliments on my skin, so I think my routine (Clarisonic brush/cleanser, etc) works well. What I don&#x27;t know is whether the Opal and another serum would work as well. I don&#x27;t have any adverse reaction to the serum, a good thing. :) All in all, I like the product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for the fine lines around the eyes especially when applied with the Opal Sonic Infusion system.</li>
    <li> This product hasn&#x27;t worked any miracles but it think it improves the appearance of lines around the eyes. Worth a try.</li>
