      <li>This is lightweight and works just as good as the real expensive&lt;br /&gt;Facial steamers,,,, !!!</li>
      <li>, it was a pain to assemble, as the instructions consist of a &amp;#34;diagram&amp;#34; of the assembled product and step 1 being to put it together according to the &amp;#34;diagram&amp;#34;... I think I spent a good 30 minutes trying to figure it out, but once it was all done, it worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>The steamer is made very cheap.  </li>
      <li>wonderful and effective facial steamer, is practical and easy to carry and use.</li>
      <li>Quite simply, it works great!</li>
      <li>Yesterday I went to use the steamer and the steam is shooting upwards and the water is leaking from the top and almost burnt my client.  </li>
      <li>I love my steamer..</li>
      <li>My advise to you is just spend more money on this type of equipment, you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I keep this 20min safe time</li>
      <li>I have used this steamer for many years now</li>
      <li>The top unit wobbles on the pole and the height adjuster is a nightmare.</li>
      <li>It is extremely light weight which is nice.  </li>
      <li>Kind of wobbly and cheap.</li>
      <li>I got the table top one</li>
      <li>but it made my neck hurt and put my face on top of the steam that made me can&#x27;t breath.  </li>
      <li>It is ok for price I paid.</li>
      <li>This facial steamer is great!</li>
      <li>I am truely pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>My clients absolutly love this.</li>
      <li>Love this my customers are pleased</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a better investment to buy elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t make sure about auto shut off because I turned off the machine ASAP before it shut off by itself.</li>
      <li>Broke,no more steam coming from steamer 3 wks after return policy expired...</li>
      <li>20min is the safe time to remember.  </li>
      <li>I can get a better warranty on an electric can opener than that.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I was able to buy this particular one and the price was in my budget ..</li>
      <li>It was easy to set up  and steamer works very well .&lt;br /&gt;Steamer is nice and hot.&lt;br /&gt;Definately a good buy..</li>
      <li>I sure hope that isn&#x27;t true!</li>
      <li>Additionally, the plastic water container doesn&#x27;t fit very securely into the body of the steamer.</li>
      <li>Very good and simple to use!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it is well made and would be great for home use, just not in a professional setting.</li>
      <li>The steam seems to flow easily.</li>
      <li>Easy to use....</li>
      <li>Easy to assemble.</li>
      <li>Clients loved the steady even strong steam.  </li>
      <li>It states that you can use tap water but in fact if you use tap water the steam doesn&#x27;t come out strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably a good back-up equipment just in case your real one breaks, but don&#x27;t bother if you&#x27;re planning on using this as your primary equipment.  </li>
      <li>Clean skin is the most important thing to have.  </li>
      <li>It seems like it&#x27;ll do just fine.</li>
      <li>It is light weight so easy to move around.  </li>
      <li>I know I am fighting the fine lines and wrinkles and dullness; it all begins with</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is ok for price I paid. Not to good.</li>
    <li> this was THE WORSE BUY...this thing is not sturdy, it goes off with a horrible beep at random....the stand is not sturdy, the wheels do not stay on and there was a extra part that i did not know what to do with...i am literally about to throw this in the trash...not sturdy</li>
    <li> It what I expected like it</li>
    <li> wonderful and effective facial steamer, is practical and easy to carry and use. I really love it my new steamer!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Good price and we have good uses with this.</li>
    <li> Very poor instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Took some time to put together.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice steamer. We&#x27;ll see how long it last</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo4RL4K6RXN198]]I used this steamer last 5 days on my client.  Assenbling the unit took about 8mins for me.  It didn&#x27;t come with detailed instruction but it was not hard to guess.&lt;br /&gt;The steam ( vapor ) is very steady.  It takes 6min to make steam from room temp water in the jar. ( I timed.)  Clients loved the steady even strong steam.  It is light weight so easy to move around.  The few things not lovely are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the alarm sound ( noise ) when water level is low.  Once I made alarm on purpose to find out how it was laud, and it was laud enough to destroy the client&#x27;s happy relaxing moment.  It is not neccessary to put this alarm system when the steamer has auto shut off or could be little bit lower.  However I timed how long the steamer goes before it makes beeps.  It went 21 min.  ( since I did&#x27;nt want over heat the machine, I timed in 2 times of 11min and 10min 30sec. )  After 21min, then alarm started beeping.  I didn&#x27;t make sure about auto shut off because I turned off the machine ASAP before it shut off by itself. ( because the alarm sound was laud. )&lt;br /&gt;So 20min is the safe time to remember.  . I keep this 20min safe time and I have not heard the beeping sound dring the facial on clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2) The nozzle root  is fixed.  It does not go up and down.( or change the angle.)  I can adjust the hight by changing the stand pole height.  The head of the steamer turns around 180 degree.  This part( the nozzle root is fixed.) does not bother me because of the price I paid.  I checked other steamer price under $150, and I didn&#x27;t find any steamer that has nozzle root movable.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best deal price great steamer for going around client house.  But if you have budget and need a steamer to be at your place, I recommend anyone to buy a better steamer with timer, bigger jar to hold more water, auto shut off without the alarm.  I&#x27;m happy about my purchase anyway.</li>
    <li> I hate it, becaue steam is veary strong its can burn your face ,easly, so becare full its not good ,</li>
    <li> Good but a little cheaper than expected not even a glass container for water overall the product was. A 3 out of 5</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to set up and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this steamer for many years now and I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> The pole height is WAY TOO SHORT.  Impossible to adjust high enough to use on a client.  I am returning.</li>
    <li> I used this steamer 2 times and it stop working. It&#x27;s not even turning on</li>
    <li> The item itself is made well...The handle doesn&#x27;t move up and down which would be alright, but the handle is not long enough. I have to put the machine up against the facial bed and it still barely reaches my clients entire face. It states that you can use tap water but in fact if you use tap water the steam doesn&#x27;t come out strong. If you use distilled water the steam is much stronger. I had to return the item because the handle is not long enough and the steam pressure was not suffienct enough for me to use in my salon. It would be great for home use or as a temporary back up. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it is well made and would be great for home use, just not in a professional setting.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE and waste of money!!! Really wobbly, thought I didn&#x27;t put it together right, but nope, I did! The ozone light worked for about a week, the steam is OK but trying to get the height adjusted to each client is impossible. Would&#x27;ve mailed it back but was too much of a pain and expense. My advise to you is just spend more money on this type of equipment, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the money! Takes about 4-5minutes to get into full steam. dense steam output with no leaks or splatters.</li>
    <li> After 3 months already broken. Called amazon to get a new one and was offered a few dollars off to buy a new one. Also if the water gets even close to the red \\&quot;low level\\&quot; line it does a CONTINUOUS HIGH PITCH BEEEEEEEP until you turn it off. Wakes relaxing clients!</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS - IT BURNED OUT IN 3 MONTHS&lt;br /&gt;and the was using it ONCE every other week - DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> a great steamer for the price...I have had expensive ones that only lasted for a couple of years..so don&#x27;t know how long it will last but it works great.</li>
    <li> For the cost it has held up very well.  I have had this for nearly 5 months and it is working without a single problem. The steam works great, the ozone makes the steam stronger.  What makes this 4 stars instead 5 is that it I looks cheap. It is all plastic.  100%  I have yet to be able to get rid of the faint plastic smell that is emitted from the steam.  The obnoxious beeping after about 15-20 mins. It does the job for my little independent spa business but definitely buy something better for a full spa. You can&#x27;t beat the price though.</li>
    <li> The size is perfect, it&#x27;s very easy to put together (just make sure you have a small wrench). Nice and clean and generates steam in less than 5 minutes. Great!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and was exactly as described in the ad. Very nice item works well and so far seems to be holding up good</li>
    <li> This is the first professional facial steamer that I purchased.  I got the table top one but it made my neck hurt and put my face on top of the steam that made me can&#x27;t breath.  So I think I should get the professional one instead.  This facial steamer is great!</li>
    <li> The screw is not long enough to go through the bottom of the stand to stabilize the machine.</li>
    <li> Fare price item in good condition, working well. The only problem is the anoying and loydly sound 20 -25 minutes later it started to work. But its a good product.</li>
    <li> It was easy to set up  and steamer works very well .&lt;br /&gt;Steamer is nice and hot.&lt;br /&gt;Definately a good buy..</li>
    <li> This is a great steamer for the price. Easy to use, produces a lot of steam and is not too hot for my client. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble. Performed as advertised. Only used a few times so far.</li>
    <li> This unit is a little rickety and sometime slightly drips. So far it hasn&#x27;t been a problem, but I can see how it might later down the road. What I dislike the most is when the water gets too low, it makes this horrible loud beeping noise instead of just shutting itself off. Some services require more steam time than others and the beep is terribly disruptive during a relaxing facial. Had I known this before purchase I would have not have bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ozone feature crapped out on me a few months ago and this week this whole unit crapped out on me only 9 months after purchase. I contacted the seller and they only warrantee the machine for 60 days, but offered replacement parts which didn&#x27;t fix my problem of what I think was a electric issue. I am careful to only use distilled water even though it says you can use tap. I work 3-4 days a week and give maybe 1-3 facials a day so it&#x27;s used regularly but not super regularly. I mentioned the base is rickety but after purchasing a $150 steamer, it came with the same exact base so I&#x27;m guessing this is just industry standard. All in all, this unit will get you through but I recommend investing in something better and more expensive if you take your business seriously.</li>
    <li> So happy product arrived on time and was  easily assembled with good steam function.  Keep up the good work !!!</li>
    <li> Good product for the price, however plastic base is a little confusing at first to assemble and is very light weight.</li>
    <li> Good,but when we use they sprayed too hot</li>
    <li> I am very dissappointed in this steamer. The plastic wheels at the bottom has come off several times.  Yesterday I went to use the steamer and the steam is shooting upwards and the water is leaking from the top and almost burnt my client.  I cant get in contact with a location to do an exchange or return because I purchased via amazon.  It will be nice if someone can contact me.</li>
    <li> The steamer is made very cheap.  The steamer arm doesn&#x27;t adjust high enough to have the steam at least a foot away from the client&#x27;s face.  It&#x27;s the same height as the top of the table which is below the client&#x27;s face.  Also the arm won&#x27;t adjust right so the client has to turn their head.  The facial table I use is a standard height as well.  The only reason I&#x27;m keeping it is because I used my old steamer stand to put it in, so at least the steam is a foot higher than the client&#x27;s face.  I bought another one and I just received it today.  I&#x27;ll know how it is when I have time to put it together later.  I used a site called ShopSalonCity.com.  If I didn&#x27;t just happen to have a stand it fit into I would of had to send it back as it is not adjustable to a standard height facial bed.  Another review said it only worked for 3 months and then broke.  I sure hope that isn&#x27;t true!</li>
    <li> This steamer does not have the power to throw the steam down. All the steam goes up...is not recommended. This is considered a major defect.</li>
    <li> We have only had the unit for 3 weeks and all is well so far.  I will certainly check with Amazon for future&lt;br /&gt;salon needs.</li>
    <li> When the unit started to steam a loud and obnoxious beep would go off and there was no way of stopping it unless u shut off the whole unit. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time ordering only to send it back.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about ordering this steamer because it&#x27;s a little on the cheap side, but my steamer broke down and I needed one right away without having to spend a lot of money. This steamer is much more powerful than my previous professional steamer. The only downside is that there are no grab bars to pull the steamer toward the facial bed. (a feature available on my old steamer) Go ahead...Purchase, Purchase, PURCHASE!</li>
    <li> I have used this steamer for almost 3 months. I really like it. It sounds an alarm if water is too low. It also has a spring to adjust up and down slightly without having to get up and change it. Really happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Stay away from this steamer. While only so much should be expected from a product that cost $70, this product still was not worth the money spent. After using it only 5 times, the water cup cracked, making it no longer usable. Do yourself a favor and buy something else.</li>
    <li> Broke down after only 5 uses! Worthless!</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy this steamer!  It over heated and stopped working after only 8 months. It was also not sturdy at all.  I called Mix Wholesale and was basically told too bad.  It is only guaranteed for 60 days.  I can get a better warranty on an electric can opener than that.  They apparently know it is cheaply made so will only give you a few months.</li>
    <li> good so far like that you can us tap water-only had it a couple of days-need to mak sure it last</li>
    <li> I purchased this for our small spa. I knew it did not have good scores, but ordered it any way because of the low cost. The steam is very good, but the total height is too low and cannot match the height of the facial bed. The height cannot be adjusted, which means that the steam would be too close to the customer&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> This product is so cheaply made.  The water reservoir is made out of plastic and the stand wiggles.  It&#x27;s probably a good back-up equipment just in case your real one breaks, but don&#x27;t bother if you&#x27;re planning on using this as your primary equipment.  I had to return it...it just was not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> I m using only 3 time but I feel its good its amazing its cost is good u can use steam, ozone light, aromothrapy really I like</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 in the last year and both machines crapped out - I use a steam very rarley and always use distilled water and clean it after every use - didn&#x27;t seem to matter. Save your money and purchase something better - this is the worst steamer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Had this steamer for less than a year and it stopped working.  Used less than 10 times.  Could not contact seller for a replacement.  Would consider purchasing something different than this one.</li>
    <li> It is only 6 months old and the heating element went and it cant be replaced.</li>
    <li> Missing Parts and I am not able to use it another waste on Amazon. Will be returning this product soon.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, it came with a broken head and leaking super hot water..unfortunately sometimes you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> Works fantastic for the price you get about 15-20 min of steam before alarm sounds for me it works great, and he has strong steam output, great item I reccommend!</li>
    <li> Love this my customers are pleased</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this steamer. I have had the unfortunate luck of having it but 3 steamers that ended breaking and having issues like weird smell, spitting and dropping hot water. This steamer is great. I Iove the steam it produces and overall how it functions.</li>
    <li> It does what it supposed to do, providing enough steam but the steam arm is not adjustable in height. It is a problem because it is too close to client&#x27;s face and the other side of the face couldn&#x27;t get enough steam. The alarm doesn&#x27;t bother me. But the inflexible arm does.</li>
    <li> I have had this steamer for 5 months and it no longer works. The steamer powers up (the vapor and ozone lights turn on) but the coils do not heat up, therefore it no longer creates steam. I am very disappointed with this product. Amazon told my husband they will not let us return it because there is a 90 day return policy through them even though the product was listed with a one year warranty when I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;-Sarah A</li>
    <li> It is extremely light weight which is nice.  Very easy to put together. The steam flow is also great.  However, it&#x27;s height is limited making it wobbly if you go too high.  Therefore, it is blowing directly into my clients nose which is uncomfortable.  Also,  I have had this steamer for over a month and it still has a plastic smell when I steam with it.  It will do for now.</li>
    <li> This steamer works great and is easy to use.  The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of flexibility with the nozzle length and direction.  But it works well and was definitely worth the money.  My husband uses it too but not for his face.  He has scalp psoriasis and uses this before he applies his medications.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  thanks I will recommend it</li>
    <li> It gives a productive, powerful steam yet gentle on skin. I&#x27;ve recommended to other practitioners, and they ordered!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about making this purchase, since you usually get what you pay for when it comes to facial machines. The other reviews definitely didn&#x27;t help me make a decision, but i was on a budget and I needed one.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it was a pain to assemble, as the instructions consist of a &amp;#34;diagram&amp;#34; of the assembled product and step 1 being to put it together according to the &amp;#34;diagram&amp;#34;... I think I spent a good 30 minutes trying to figure it out, but once it was all done, it worked perfectly. I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re going into the Aesthetics field and would like to purchase a steamer for home use. As far as the auto shut off alarm that people seem to be complaining about, I&#x27;ve had no issues with it, and there&#x27;s no need to even have the steam on for that long. Turn it on before doing a second cleanse on your client (or whomever you&#x27;re working on) and it will be ready by the time you exfoliate. Oh and I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the company could definitely solve the instructions issue, especially since I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s spent a good amount of time trying to figure it out.</li>
    <li> I love my steamer.. I&#x27;m so happy I was able to buy this particular one and the price was in my budget ..</li>
    <li> The motor burned out before a year :( but it served its purpose. Didn&#x27;t have a warranty , but for the price and the urgency of having it for work, it worked out perfect. Delivery was quick and all the parts were there :)</li>
    <li> So i got this steamer for my house so that i can lay in bed while steaming my face or giving friends or family a facial. This steamer is so powerful!!! more steam comes out than some places that ive recieved professional facials from.Very easy to assemble, The directions were not that great but u do need a rench to screw the pole into the black floor piece. The pole goes up and down so the fact that the nozzle does not move is not an issue to me at all. Only annoying things as other reviewers mentioned is that stupid alarm!!! i wish there was a way to lower it or turn it off. but other than that I am very pleased with with purchase. Oh yeah and i have natural 4c hair and didnt want to buy a hair steamer so i just aim the steam onto my head and it works great!</li>
    <li> Initially I was very impressed with the esthetics of the steamer, but after assembly, I noticed that no matter how tightly I adjusted the bottom bolt at the base of the rolling wheel, it still seems the unit slants at an angle. Additionally, the plastic water container doesn&#x27;t fit very securely into the body of the steamer. Having said that, the machine operates very efficiently and produces a steady and relatively strong stream of steam at a much faster rate than other units I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> Seem ok so far. The steam seems to flow easily. The only draw back is that the cord is very short. I will have to use an extension cord. I also was a bit thrown off by the plastic water reservoir. I have not used the steamer in a treatment yet. It seems like it&#x27;ll do just fine. I went ahead and attached it to my old steamers base. It fits perfectly and my old base is sturdier and adjustable. I&#x27;m hoping I do not have any problems with the alarm like other customers. For $68 it seems like a good buy. My other steamer is only 6mo old and I paid over $200 for it. It recently stopped working after it shut off due to low water levels. That&#x27;s why I bought this one. I like the look of this one better then my more expensive one. So, we shall see how it performs during my next facial! :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth it! This is lightweight and works just as good as the real expensive&lt;br /&gt;Facial steamers,,,, !!! Best buy for sure</li>
    <li> Last week my wife, turned it on... and it worked very well. It was a good purchase and good price.</li>
    <li> My clients love this! Works great! Fast delivery time.</li>
    <li> Hi all - I purchased this item on 10/24/2013 and I delayed a review until I had the opportunity to use the product thoroughly. Quite simply, it works great! I&#x27;ve used the machine as the instructions prescribe and I have not had any trouble. The steam is powerful and the ozone feature is an added bonus. The only point of contention here is the stand (base) -  it wobbles, and does not stand firm. The stand also cannot be extended long enough to use with anything other than a folding chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller contacted me on 11/7/2013 to ask for feedback. I shared my thoughts and they really seemed to care about my experience. All things considered, I&#x27;m happy that I made this purchase despite some of the other reviews I read.</li>
    <li> This works great. The steamer is a  great inexpensive tool to use in facials, but I just wish that the nozzle would have more flexability. I can use it effectively when the steamer is all the way up and my table is all the way down delivering the steam to the entire face without burning the client or just getting part of the face. I am also happy that you do not have to use distilled water, however it is recommended. Over all, I am very happy with my purchase. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the nozzle doesn&#x27;t move other then from side to side in a 180 degree turn.</li>
    <li> Happy with the prompt delivery. The product is proving to justify the value. Only the look is not as attractive as the other similar items of the same nature. Could improve the shape and color of the base!</li>
    <li> Clean skin is the most important thing to have.  I know I am fighting the fine lines and wrinkles and dullness; it all begins with makine sure your skin is clean and a facial steamer is the most important tool to get the end result of clear beautiful, glowing young skin.</li>
    <li> I own a spa and my professional steamer glass broke. I needed a Steamer quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This steamer is cheaply made its hard plastic&lt;br /&gt;And the arm is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s what I paid for a professional steamer runs for abou 200US plus so for 80 I didn&#x27;t expect much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The steam however is excellent very powerful and that&#x27;s the important thing. If you want your skin steamed buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I&#x27;m not sure for durability so I will buy a professional one later.</li>
    <li> The Parthat the steam come thru open, like it was glue, and leak water in client while giving a service</li>
    <li> It is good, but will be better  to have longer/higher stand.... Easy to use.... I will recommended this  product to use.</li>
    <li> Kind of wobbly and cheap. It will work for at home personal use.</li>
    <li> Previously I had a professional unit that did not work very well. This unit was not as high quality.  It is totally made of plastic.  The arm, the base and even the water storage.  But it does produce a good amount of steam and it does the job much better than my professional unit that was on the blink.  Don&#x27;t know how long it will last, especially if I use it on a regular basis but for now I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this machine.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I wanted....Great product... my clients are very pleased with the results after each use.... planning to order another soon...</li>
    <li> This device has elevated my business. My clients absolutly love this. There was a minor dispute with the seller but I was taken care of in immediate fashion. I am truely pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t completely understanding  of the directions but not too difficult to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the loud alarm when water is out, takes about 6 minutes to start steaming and runs approximately 30 minutes until next refill.  It&#x27;s great for a backup but if you&#x27;re used to a timer and bigger glass tank then spend your money and buy one that has more professional options.  If you are doing back to back facials this would be a waste of time to get. But is good for a starter or emergency back up.</li>
    <li> From the moment this steamer arrived, it was sensitive.  The \\&quot;alarm\\&quot; would constantly sound off for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this machine on a daily basis, 5 - 6 days a week.  Three months in, it could not be appeased.  After contacting the seller, I was advised to take the machine apart and \\&quot;disconnect the black wires\\&quot;.  The body is welded together.  Remember, I use the steamer for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another email to the seller and they said they would contact the distributor.  It has been 6 weeks, no word, another machine from a known distributor and this steamer is in my garage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$80 @ 3 months....  It&#x27;s a better investment to buy elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is like my fifth machine, so I am learning the distilled only rules DO APPLY. The steam is best of all my machines. The little port in front on the steam spout allows for me to place some EOs on a wood stick for aromatherapy. The perfect height and the swivel head is easy to adjust. Watch the water level both above and below the line. Wont start if its too much, loud annoying beap if below</li>
    <li> Steamer is not the color shown. It is actually a weird light purple. The top unit wobbles on the pole and the height adjuster is a nightmare. Spend the extra money for something that you won&#x27;t have to worry about harming your clients... I returned mine, now the company won&#x27;t reimburse a $20 shipping fee because they say the item is as described...</li>
    <li> Broke,no more steam coming from steamer 3 wks after return policy expired...no feedback from company.</li>
    <li> I have been happy with the steamer other than the fact that there is a horribly LOUD high pitch alarm that goes off when water level&lt;br /&gt;is too high or gets low. This steamer does not hold enough water for my entire facial so I have to add water during in order to avoid the alarm going off! It was a cheap steamer so for the money it is doing the job, however in the future will probably just spend a little more to avoid the screeching LOUD alarm on this one that happens out of nowhere if you are not watching your water level during facial.</li>
    <li> Very good and simple to use!!!! Highlanders recommend!!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Use on one client every week, is going fine so far</li>
    <li> Very good i suggest to all salon by this.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  The steamer arrived before the estimated ship time.  And it works great, my clients love it!  If I had to say anything negative, it didn&#x27;t come with a lot of instructions, but set up is pretty elementary, just not sure about the aromatherapy feature.</li>
    <li> I loved it. Worth every penny.</li>
