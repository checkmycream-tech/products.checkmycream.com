      <li>I also love Cartier, Baiser Vole, because of the underlying spice that finishes a powdery start.</li>
      <li>I am not even sure if the parfumes I have purchased are originals...</li>
      <li>and it gets better after it wear off love love</li>

      <li>So in that regard, the more the merrier when it comes to reviews.</li>

      <li>I loved it, a lil bit strong but a great and lasting fragrance, I put it on in the morning and it lasted all day .</li>
      <li>but it smells pretty good</li>
      <li>For the price this is a great value...smells great to wear everyday ..</li>
      <li>Now, I still love Macy&#x27;s and their 8 &#x27;free gifts&#x27; with your fragrance purchase.</li>
      <li>&amp; you&#x27;ll know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about!! :-)</li>
      <li>Soft smell...just love it!!</li>
      <li>I love clean</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now onto what you really want to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ferragamo F For Fascinating is light and airy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good 100$+ and is mainly sold at Nieman Marcus.</li>
      <li>The price is beyond amazing and the shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>I am an avid fan of Ferragamo perfumes and I love most of them.</li>
      <li>No matter where I&#x27;m going, &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; will be fine for the occasion.</li>
      <li>this perfume is has a light smell</li>
      <li>They are fabulous.</li>
      <li>I got it for my mother as a mother&#x27;s day gift, and I constantly find myself using it too lol.</li>
      <li>We all know better though, right?</li>
      <li>then the original that I have purchased from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I have no frame of reference to say if this is the original.</li>
      <li>Bought for my mother, she loves it, will be buying more but a different kind</li>
      <li>this is very nice-- fresh and definitely feminine without being too girly or flowery.  </li>
      <li>Ferragamo&#x27;s fascinating night parfume and I like it a little bit more...</li>
      <li>lucky guess</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more :)</li>
      <li>:) I do so love perfumes.othesline freshness of springtime, more flowers, less fruits.</li>
      <li>First off, this is my signature scent!</li>
      <li>Smell is light and is not irritating.</li>
      <li>Vera Wang has some fabulous scents; Princess is very &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34;; I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it.</li>
      <li>, fresh smells and</li>
      <li>Good grief, I paid $26 or something for this awesome scent!!!</li>
      <li>and I smelled a perfume made by the same person and liked it.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m in a blazing hurry to get out the door, I would easily grab this without a second, or first for that matter :),</li>
      <li>It has a &#x27;familiar&#x27; scent; I believe because it wants the first-time wearer to feel as though they&#x27;re remembering something or someone fun, yet does not replicate another scent.</li>
      <li>luck and if you like Oscar De Larenta, the original signature scent (I find it very powdery</li>
      <li>luck and if you like Oscar De Larenta, the original signature scent (I find it very powdery</li>
      <li>Very strong to the point of just use a tiny bit on wrists</li>

      <li>and I like it very much.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>It is a morning, afternoon, evening scent for sure and lends itself to being a go-to perfume when you just don&#x27;t want to actually think about it.</li>
      <li>Let me first say rating a perfume is one thing but reviewing a perfume is another animal all together.</li>
      <li>I do enjoy a nice mature, deep scent but not often and nearly always at night.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Scent is subjective I know. But this is very strong for my taste. Very strong to the point of just use a tiny bit on wrists and I&#x27;m \\&quot;seriously\\&quot; scented. Its a fair price so try it if you want to give it a shot. Just be warned. Very Strong floral/citrus/musk scent. Its okay if you leave it on after a while but takes a couple hours to \\&quot;cool\\&quot; off.</li>
    <li> This Eau De Toilette spray was exactally what I ordered! I had recieved a sample of this fragrance a couple years ago and it smells just as I remember! I love it!</li>
    <li> Soft smell...just love it!! I ran out and could not find it in a department store....everyone alway give me complements when wearing this fragrance</li>
    <li> If you are one of those women who like a fine fragrance, softly and different, this is the one for you. I highly recommend it, you won&#x27;t regret it, but for me the most important thing is that this fragrance doesn&#x27;t make you feel sick. Try it.</li>
    <li> I like so much..love,love.love..Quality and good price..</li>
    <li> Just as described, excellent product. arrived on time</li>
    <li> I had this before and I like it very much. It came in a good shape. Good price, good perfume.</li>
    <li> I have gotten sooooo! many people asking me what am I wearing(I never tell) lol!! this perfume is has a light smell and it gets better after it wear off love love love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume because I was in Macy&#x27;s and I smelled a perfume made by the same person and liked it. I do not know if it is the same perfume but it smells pretty good and I thought it was a good price.  The bottle was a lot bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents.  You will be enveloped in beautiful vapors when wearing this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if it was longer lasting but I love this!  I just got this yesterday.  I love clean, fresh smells and this is very nice-- fresh and definitely feminine without being too girly or flowery.  The cap is creative but hard to keep on.</li>
    <li> Smell is light and is not irritating. I am an avid fan of Ferragamo perfumes and I love most of them. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> 1 0 0 %% g o o deverything good with this perfumemy girl loves it so much to use it everyday</li>
    <li> I have no frame of reference to say if this is the original. I know is that it is pretty nice!</li>

    <li> My wife loved it...lucky guess</li>
    <li> I ordered F for Fascinating, but received F for Fascinating Night instead. I have always loved F for Fascinating. The F for Fascinating Night does not&lt;br /&gt;smell the same. I can&#x27;t return it because I threw the box away. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with my perfume smell is wonderful, lasts long and all who are around you feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I volvere to buy not want it to end: D</li>

    <li> a mi esposa le encanta esta fragancia y el precio muy por debajo de lo que se compra en venezuela recomendado para regalar</li>
    <li> I have Ferragamo&#x27;s fascinating night parfume and I like it a little bit more...This parfume is almost the same just not as strong...I have to apply it every ten minutes...I am not even sure if the parfumes I have purchased are originals...I have purchased Euphoria and it was totally different color then the original that I have purchased from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Este perfume tiene un aroma s&amp;uacute;per agradable, muy buena relaci&amp;oacute;n precio calidad, realmente lo puedo recomendar, es una excelente compra.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this perfume , fast delivery and good price .i will order again !</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great value...smells great to wear everyday ..product was delivered with no problem..the bottle shape is cute too also</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother, she loves it, will be buying more but a different kind</li>
    <li> I got it for my mother as a mother&#x27;s day gift, and I constantly find myself using it too lol.</li>
    <li> Let me first say rating a perfume is one thing but reviewing a perfume is another animal all together. This will be, of course, very subjective as what someone smells can be so different than another. So in that regard, the more the merrier when it comes to reviews. So I will do my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start by saying I love light, somewhat powdery, casual scents for the most part. I do enjoy a nice mature, deep scent but not often and nearly always at night. Give me an all around, everyday use smell and I&#x27;m happy. I also like being known for a certain smell. My friends know I&#x27;m coming when they smell Juicy Couture. I love it!!! All of them are just excellent. I also love Cartier, Baiser Vole, because of the underlying spice that finishes a powdery start. It is the BOMB!!! I don&#x27;t have a favorite as scents to me are mood induced and inducing. Vera Wang has some fabulous scents; Princess is very &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34;; I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. Oscar De Larenta is a longtime scent I&#x27;m fond of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of strong patchouli or deep spice, like Opium. I&#x27;m not a Chanel No.5 gal, even at 44 I still feel like I&#x27;m 6 and sneaking around on my grandmama&#x27;s dresser. WHEW, I remember that stuff! I like finding new scents. I like changing it up, but still having my usual 4-day-a-week smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto what you really want to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ferragamo F For Fascinating is light and airy. It is a morning, afternoon, evening scent for sure and lends itself to being a go-to perfume when you just don&#x27;t want to actually think about it. If I&#x27;m in a blazing hurry to get out the door, I would easily grab this without a second, or first for that matter :), thought. ***No matter where I&#x27;m going, &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; will be fine for the occasion.*** Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not fussy, pretentious and doesn&#x27;t feel the need to be similar to any other scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; may &#x27;remind&#x27; you of something else, you just won&#x27;t be able to put your finger on it. It has a &#x27;familiar&#x27; scent; I believe because it wants the first-time wearer to feel as though they&#x27;re remembering something or someone fun, yet does not replicate another scent. &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; is like putting on a brand new pair of slippers that feel like you&#x27;ve worn them for a year. &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; is like an old quilt. It gets better the longer you have it; or, in this case, wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it is EDT and not EDP so one can&#x27;t really complain about the scent not lasting all day long. I don&#x27;t know of very many EDTs that will last more than a few hours, and if you&#x27;re lucky, the entire work day. We all know better though, right? I&#x27;m not going to ask more of an item than it can give me. I&#x27;m satisfied with the amount of time I had it on and still could smell it. It isn&#x27;t a very long lasting EDT and after 4-6 hours, I&#x27;d like an extra spritz to freshen back up. Now, having said that, it was an AMAZING price for 3 ounces. Good grief, I paid $26 or something for this awesome scent!!! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are VERY FEW places that I will purchase perfume &amp;#34;scent unsmelled&amp;#34;. I trust FragranceNet and have never gotten anything other than what I asked for and what was described. They are fabulous. Now, I still love Macy&#x27;s and their 8 &#x27;free gifts&#x27; with your fragrance purchase. I got a KILLER tote with an Allure purchase a few years back and it is still commanding complements. Of course, like we all know, I did actually pay for the tote. That is why I like the no nonsense way of business that I get here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I had the choice of 0-10 stars. I would give it an 8. I think it&#x27;s better than a 4 out of 5 though. I&#x27;d recommend this to any age bracket, even young teens. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; though, maybe &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; is appropriate for &amp;#34;F&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m no expert but I can smell pear, faint leather and afternotes of a very light spice (for lack of a better adjective) that lingers. It begins and ends with a powdery, clothesline freshness of springtime, more flowers, less fruits. If it were a color, it would be a matte cornflower blue. I love the scent and so does my mom; however she says she gets a vague shampoo smell. I do not. She likes bold, mature scents like Opium and Youth Dew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and if you like Oscar De Larenta, the original signature scent (I find it very powdery but I do like it), and you like Vera Wang&#x27;s scents, then you should like this. I&#x27;m off to go spritz a bit of it on myself now. :) I do so love perfumes.othesline freshness of springtime, more flowers, less fruits. If it were a color, it would be a matte cornflower blue.

    <li> I am beyond, BEYOND, happy with this order. First off, this is my signature scent! I have been using my last bottle for special occasions because this perfume is NOT cheap. It&#x27;s a good 100$+ and is mainly sold at Nieman Marcus. The price is beyond amazing and the shipping was very fast. Thank you so much! Please do not stop selling this product and don&#x27;t change the price! I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more :) The scent it sweet and mature and relaxing all at the same time. I have major allergies and this is the only perfume that does not make me sneeze like a crazy person. It lasts all day and smells better as the day goes on. Ladies, it&#x27;ll make you very irresistible to the significant other trust me! ;)</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It is not real heavy and has wonderful spicy undertones. It is a welcome addition to my scent collection!</li>
    <li> Great floral, but clean scent, so glad I gave it a try! I gave it for the holidays, and everyone loved it!</li>
