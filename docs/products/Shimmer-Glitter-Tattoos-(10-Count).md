<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I put these tattoos on my daughters arms a few times and each time they lasted barely more than a few hours, half a day at best. As soon as you sleep and the sheets rub on your skin, they rub off almost completely:( I&#x27;m hoping for a refund!</li>
    <li> They loved it and used it all up within the first couple of days. I wish there was more in there.</li>
    <li> Great fill in gift for girls and I guess boys too, but more for girls!  Last long even through showers and handwashing, would purchase again...</li>
    <li> I have a 5 year old girl who is all about glitter.  So when I saw this product I was a bit skeptical but it was affordable on Amazon so I went for it.  Now, all the girls in the neighborhood line up.  The tattoos stay on for about a week and are very pretty.  I enjoy the joy it brings them!  Worth it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift for a 7 year old. I have her one for X-mas and she love it so much that it was all she wanted for her B-day.</li>
    <li> Works great and applies well. Stays on and removes easily.</li>
    <li> Tattoos came out great . Brush could be better</li>
    <li> my 5 years old daughter really liked it for  $7 its worth it. It has only 3 colors.  If any higher than I would expect more colors and stencils</li>
    <li> Kids wanted this and I thought why not.  They last for days even with showers.  Only draw back is stencils hard to reuse.  I think the deluxe kit might be in my future.</li>
    <li> beautiful! the stencils work well and the colours are lovely.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve only used this product once since I got it.  My little girl likes these tattoos, I just don&#x27;t care to get all that glitter out.. lol</li>
    <li> This product was for a ten year old&#x27;s birthday.  Came on time, was exactly what is described.  The colors are pink, blue, and purple.  NOT WHAT IS PICTURED!!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was just as represented.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old daughter loves this kit! That&#x27;s saying a lot. They look cool and stay on for a long time.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves it -- it&#x27;s a big hit! They played with this for hours when I gave it to them!</li>
    <li> She was delighted, Grandma wondered why I paid that much for such a small item, but, being a Grandma of such a precious little girl who really really wanted it is reason enough I guess :).  I think the first tattoo did last several days for her.  Since they last for a few days, and she wants it somewhere that she can see it, she saved some for when she would be off school for several days - we figured the school might not be happy about an 8 year old having tattoos :)).  She absolutely loves the little &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> i considerg this rating because my daughter tried it then she took a shower and it was gone and she said mommy this is a waste of money</li>
    <li> Just opening the container gets glitter everywhere!  The tattoo however stayed on pretty good.  My daughter would probably give it a higher rating in all fairness;)</li>
    <li> The package did not contain 10 tattoo stencils as listed.  Of the 9 included, one was a duplicate.  Also, it seems like the stencils are single-use only, which isn&#x27;t specified on the box or instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little glitter goes a long way and the tatts really do last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product in-store for $10.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old loves this! She uses it so much we bought refills and extra stencils. She can put her own glitter tats on and somehow this doesn&#x27;t rub onto everything in the house.</li>
    <li> This rating is more for the seller than the product.  Two of the three glitter containers didn&#x27;t have their lids on tight, so product arrived with glitter spilled all over, leaving less than half of usable glitter.  The packaging was ripped and taped up with scotch tape.  There was dirty adhesive on it from an old price sticker.  I bought it for as a birthday gift for a friend&#x27;s daughter, but can&#x27;t give it to her since the packaging makes it look like it&#x27;s been used and a good part of the product is missing.  When I bought it nothing on the web page implied that the product would not be new or not look new and clean.</li>
    <li> I buy these regularly and pull them out anytime I&#x27;ve got girls ages 2 through 22 together. I&#x27;ve got several younger boys that will do them as well or like to create designs for the girls.  It is messy and you will need adult supervision for ages 8 &amp; under. Washes off with alcohol. Put a sheet down to catch the extra glitter. Pay a little more and get the ones from Amazon. It&#x27;s easier than waiting forever from China only to find the glue dried and the glitter everwhere. Once you buy the kit and understand how to do it, you can just replace pieces as you need to or add different glitter colors.  But don&#x27;t go too overboard with colors or you will find yourself with a huge mess and kids who can&#x27;t decide what colors to pick so they use them all and  the end result is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tattoos really do last for about 4-5 days. After that the edges start to come off and it doesn&#x27;t look as nice. Don&#x27;t be afraid to use a lot of glue. Those that say it came off in a day didn&#x27;t use enough glue. And don&#x27;t scrub it in the shower, try to keep it completely dry as possible but a shower with scrubbing it won&#x27;t hurt it.  The stickers stencils are not re-useable so order extra or buy some shipping labels and print designs on them and let the girls cut them out. You can also let them draw their own. Be sure to use a good, sharp razor/box cutter.</li>
    <li> Theres not even enough glitter in these tiny cases. and hard to open, and when you do get it open, be careful, glitter will fly out too easily leaving a big mess. The sketching stickers are not resusable. So once you use one to do a tat, that&#x27;s it&lt;br /&gt;The glue is also too small of a tube (not enough to go with the designs) and feels tacky.&lt;br /&gt;we threw ours away after one tattoo. poor product, id stick with reg fake tattoos that you have to use water on.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this would be nice for my daughter whose always been a fan of fake tattoos. I thought, oh! itll look neater with the glitter.&lt;br /&gt;wrong. it doesn&#x27;t last. and the glitter rubs off.&lt;br /&gt;garbage!</li>
    <li> This package was horrible! looked like it was run over by a truck. I could not give this used beat up looking item as a gift. Was not wrapped for shipping. Hmmmm let&#x27;s put an egg in an envelope and see if it makes it intact?  It was marked as a FOOD item (WHY? maybe it could get through Chinese customs cheaper?) Anyways my item was as flat as the envelope it was placed in and shipping takes forever.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from a company on Amazon called MI CASA as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old daughter. Fortunately, I read the reviews beforehand and purchased extra stencils, glitter, and glue from Ebay since the product doesn&#x27;t come with much in it. The package arrived with loose glitter everywhere, a missing stencil, the box dented and scotch taped together, and the glue bottle half empty and hard as a rock. Had I not purchased the extra products, the gift would have been a useless flop. The company selling this product needs to read the numerous other reviews posted and discard all of these old and/or used boxes of Shimmer. There is nothing in the product description about the product being used or damaged in any way. I must say that, despite the poor state that the product came in, my daughter loved applying the tattoos. So far, they have survived two showers and she was able to apply them without my help.</li>
    <li> The glitter did not stay on for more than a few hours and after the glitter fell off it looked like my daughter had star shaped bruises.  Temporary tattoos that you rub on look better than this item.  Huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> The glue actually lasted 7 days! Crazy I didn&#x27;t believe it, but then I tried it again (on my hand) and it didn&#x27;t last as long, I suppose it was because that area had more wear than say on your shoulder or something</li>
    <li> as seen on tv, so not perfect, but very fun</li>
    <li> We bought this for my son&#x27;s birthday party. All the kids loved getting tatoos. Unlike in the instructions we leave the tatoo on when we put the glitter on so the glitter only goes on the design area. Tatoos last a really long time. A friend decided to get for her daughter&#x27;s party and it was a big hit there too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is fine, was not packaged very well so the box is smashed up and this is a gift.</li>
    <li> the box that this came in looked like it had been in the garbage. When we opened it ,all of the glitter packs were empty since they had all spilled into the box. Unable to use, made a huge mess and was immediately thrown away.</li>
    <li> The box was open and glitter was every where.. But my daughter enjoyed it. The product was good but the presentation not so much.</li>
    <li> The Glitter Tattoos were a gift for my daughter. She had a ball with her friend putting on the tattoos. It does get a little messy but overall I was satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, glue was completely hard, tried to add a tiny bit of water to it but didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I gave these as extra gifts and they loved them for a low price.  My son even loves to put the dragon &amp; sun on his arms..</li>
    <li> this was super cute for my 11 year old. she puts them on herself and on me. she wore them on the cruise ship and lasted the entire week.</li>
    <li> This is not the same shimmer tattoos that you see on TV.  The colors are not the same as shown in the picture.  I got light blue, dark blue and pink.  The box also is missing the &amp;#34;Shimmer&amp;#34; name on the box.</li>
    <li> Product worked well, the only thing I did not like was that the stickers are not re-useable.  Otherwise my daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my niece , she lived them .</li>
    <li> Great product my daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> Worth the $6-7 I payed for them  not the $15 I saw them some other places!  Includes 3 small pots of glitter and a small nail-polish like jar of glue and stencils.  Kids had fun with them, and they seemed to stay on well for 4-5 days.  Stencils are &#x27;single use&#x27; peel and stick, but if you&#x27;re careful with them and re-stick them back to the sheet when you&#x27;re done, you can get a couple uses from each.  &#x27;paint&#x27; the glue on and sprinkle the glitter over it.  Would be good for a party or short entertainment.</li>
    <li> I tried it on my friend that lives close by and she loved it it shined so bright and it was th best thing ever you have to buy</li>
    <li> I was also skeptical about this product b/c after all, how can you shower and the glitter not wash off? Well it really does work and exceptionally well I might add, went far beyond my expectations. I tattooed my daughter&#x27;s upper arm and several of her friends, 2 weeks later and they still had their tattoos on and in nice condition. I also put the backing back on the stencil and plan to use it again, its still sticky enough. The whole process was easy and I am very pleased with the results considering its a tv product and bought at Wal-Mart for only $10. A great buy, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> Bought for a pre-teen despite her father&#x27;s objections to any more glitter in the house.  Box was slightly crushed when received, but no damage to product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for an 8 year old girl.  She loves these glitter tattoos!  My only complaint is that they wear off relatively quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a special treat for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s messy and because of the poor design of the product, it&#x27;s impossible to get the results pictured on the box.  The brush becomes gummy and makes the glitter stick everywhere, not just where you&#x27;ve applied the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> The glue was dryed out.</li>
    <li> I received these and the glue was completely dried out, so the tattoos wouldn&#x27;t work at all. My daughter was extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered three of these for my kids and niece.  One was meant for a gift.  When we opened the ones for my kids the glue had solidified.  We checked the other two boxes and the glue was bad in those too.  So no on time birthday present for my niece.  I logged in to Amazon to find that the product could only be returned for a refund (not exchanged for a functional one) and I have to go through printing, packaging and mailing all three boxes before I can process the refund.  Not a set of chores I want to add to my list.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter for her birthday.  When it arrived the package looked fine, but when we tried to open it, it was sealed shut.  Once we finally got it open we could see that the glue pen was open and most of the glue was all over the inside of the box.  One of the glitters was also open but not much of it had spilled out.  We tried the product out very carefully following the directions with what was left of the glue.  The tattoo looked great but sadly it did not even last an hour.  My daughter was very disappointed with her birthday gift.  I was disappointed I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I notice that the some stickers are hard to remove from clear plastic like Peace signs.  If I remove the tattoo before you put on the arm hard to align the design.  Everything is a fall a part.  It doesn&#x27;t get aligned Peace mark.</li>
    <li> I got this for my little cousin&#x27;s and although they complained about my aunt&#x27;s name being on the package I&#x27;m sure they loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Amazon Warehouse and the glue came completely dry, making the product useless. This was a gift for my daughter, so I had to run to the local drug store to buy a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works very well. The tattoos stay on for several days and look nice. However, the instructions ask to remove the stencil before applying glitter and that did not work for us. The designs turn out nicer when applying the glitter over the stencil and then removing. Overall, a fun activity, probably for kids 6 and up.</li>
    <li> The glue was all dried up and the stencils aren&#x27;t crisp. Might be old product. I&#x27;m not thrilled with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I think this stuff should be intended for teenage girls.&lt;br /&gt;It looks pretty when an adult puts it on. Plus I think they should sell the&lt;br /&gt;delux kit for the price of the regular kit.</li>
    <li> My granddaughters, aged 9 and 12, loved these tattoos. They were easy to apply, sparkly and pretty, and long lasting.</li>
    <li> The glue leaked in the package.  There is not any glue left in the tube.  It will cost almost as much to return this as the item cost!  I will spend more next time and buy it (or a similar product) in a retail store to make sure it isn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these easy to use stencils and tattoos.  They last forever</li>
    <li> This product goes on as easily as advertised. All three of my kids love getting shimmer tattoos. They stay on for almost a week, but wipe off easily with baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our family has sensitive skin and have had no reactions or problems at all at the site of the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> after reading reviews of the glued being dried out i decided to give it a try anyways since its so much cheaper than others. I got 2 sets one as a gift. both boxes had glue that was dried out. without the glue this product is useless. did not return b/c shipping would have been more than what i paid for the actual product. i would give negative stars if that was an option. do not buy waste of money!</li>
    <li> Glue completely solidified/dried up. 2 disappointed little girls on Christmas morning. Had to go out and buy again to make up for it.</li>
    <li> They look great but didn&#x27;t last long. It wasn&#x27;t as much of a mess as I expected either. My girls loved them.</li>
    <li> This was totally worth the money.  I bought some other kids on Amazon and this was by far the best product.</li>
    <li> gt here really fast. is a gift for my 6 year old girl. i cant wait for her to open it since shes been asking for it since it came out</li>
    <li> Great for kids as a gift. They  will love you for it!! They wouldn&#x27;t even wait to use it. It arrived on time and  in good condition;)</li>
    <li> although I had issues with the condition of this item, the seller has gone above and beyond to help correct the situation I could not ask for a better experience ,and my daughter is now happy with a replacement. I would highly recommend doing business with this seller.</li>
    <li> My children have really enjoyed these simple glitter tattoos.  We ordered additional stencils and glitter for more variety and have been impressed with how long the tattoos really last!</li>
    <li> But I&#x27;m glad I gave it to her at her house and not mine.  The tatoos are easy to apply, and are permanent. The glitter can get a little messy, so be sure to put a towel or cloth around the area where you are applying it.  I&#x27;m the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; grandma for buying this. Can&#x27;t beat a compliment like that!</li>
    <li> All my kids love these, including the little boys. If you&#x27;re artistically inclined, you can make new designs and skip the stencils. Just paint the glue on with a paintbrush. Lots of fun and they stay on for days. I wore a glitter dragonfly for almost a week over the summer. Fun stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and when I opened it at a birthday party, the glue tube had been opened, so was dried up. The Glitter had been opened. The little plastic caps in new ones under the case cap were missing and the little brush wasn&#x27;t the one that comes with the kit. I complained about this to Amazon before leaving this review and didn&#x27;t hear back. I would not but from this seller again.</li>
    <li> So it was not usable at all very upsetting. I wish the product was as described but it was not</li>
    <li> This are great.  My child just loves them.  You only get 3 colors but you can buy more.  And the glue is very small so I am not sure how long it will last.  This product lived up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers said, this was a complete and utter disappointment. We bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas. She was so excited to see I bought her special wish list item, and we immediately opened it to put on tattoos. The glue was as hard as a rock, and crumbly. We added some water and tried to stir it, it wouldn&#x27;t mix in and just stayed a watery, clumped up mess. We tried to spread it on her arm, hoping some glitter would stick..it didn&#x27;t. We tossed the glue and tried to use our own and the glitter just fell off her arm. Very very disappointed, this company obviously sells a damaged product, it was poorly made, and the commercial shows it being easy to apply. The glue was hard as a rock!! What a sham! Do not buy from this company unless you want to waste your money!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, but it works as advertised. We got this at a local drugstore for $10. Glitter tattoos at the fair are $5 each, this came to $1 each, so it is a value. The fair tattoo washed off after the first shower. This is still going strong. The lines are crisp, the colors are bright. I put this on my daughter&#x27;s upper arm, starting in the middle to avoid bubbles. I brushed glue on, not  too light and not too heavy. I suspect you can go really light, as long as it is fully covering. If you go over/outside the stencil you have to wipe it off right away. If you leave a teeny schmear you can scrape it with your fingernail, but if you just leave it you will have an extra little piece of tattoo that won&#x27;t come off.  A couple little glue spots didn&#x27;t want to go clear and I was worried the rest would dry out so we went with it. I suspect it would have been fine to wait, it was really tacky, but it seems none the worse for wear. You have to dab A LOT of glitter on, do it over newspaper to save the extra. My daughter doesn&#x27;t like pink so we dumped the extra blue and purple into the pink container to use later. It&#x27;s easy to blend the colors, but you have to just put a little of the first color so there&#x27;s still some tacky parts left for the second color. I put the backing back on the stencil and then wiped up as much of the glue as I could with a damp paper towel. I have not tried to reuse it yet, there may be a problem with the edges with the leftover glue that is still on there. Five showers later of just running water over it and is just starting to wear on the edges.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and was very easy to apply. Stencils work great.</li>
    <li> Very fun and glitter is so pretty.  Easily washes off.</li>
    <li> The kids really enjoyed these and they looked good and were easy for them to use. Lasted for a reasonable amout of time and the cost was good.</li>
    <li> This was a lot of fun for my teenage daughter and her seven year old sister. I haven&#x27;s seen them have this much fun together in a long time. the only reason for three stars instead of 4 was the mess the glitter made.</li>
    <li> Product arrived earlier than expected, which is great.  I&#x27;m not sure how the tattoos look since it&#x27;s for a gift but I did expect a bigger box.  Don&#x27;t ask why!  I&#x27;m sure that won&#x27;t matter as far as the way the tattoos look and hopefully they&#x27;ll be something my daughter will enjoy.</li>
    <li> My niece went wild with joy when she opened her gift...by the end of e night everyone had shimmer tattoos...including all the grown ups! She is 8 and it was a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d opened this Christmas present back in October when I ordered it. The glue was smashed inside the kit and completely dried up all over the inside. My six year old daughter brought it to Christmas dinner to give everyone tattoos and she was devastated when she opened up the box. So we don&#x27;t know if this works well or not, just make sure you check inside your box hat everything is intact.</li>
    <li> This really works and lasts even longer then it says it does I love it. My daughter loves it which is who I bought it for but I use it as well</li>
    <li> My girls love the shimmer. Easy to use, a bit messy with the glitter but easy to clean up. Super fast shipment.</li>
    <li> The kids love the tattoos and if you do them correctly they last a while. The only down side is if you let the kids do it they will make a mess.</li>
    <li> Really fun idea, but this does leave a residue which is impossible to get off with soap and water. Not too big of a deal though. I just use eye makeup remover or nail polish remover and the residue will come off. The tattoos really do last for several days. After that though parts of them start to come off and it doesn&#x27;t look as nice. We have not had one make it a full week completely intact, but I think that is asking too much from this or any product.</li>
    <li> My five year old granddaughter wanted this shimmer tattoo set.  I was pretty sure we wouldn&#x27;t have the pictured results and very sure we&#x27;d have a mess to clean up.  I was wrong!  The process was fairly simple, not messy, and the end result was great!!  I was pleased, she was THRILLED!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Had to return due to glue being dried up. Luckily Amazon is awesome when it comes to returns. But beware. Looks like it&#x27;s hit or miss with the glue problem.</li>
    <li> Used for a party and toddlers and teens enjoyed. Stencils were used more than once. Lasts a long time. Much better than a regular tattoo that you put on with water.</li>
    <li> The glue in this product did not work. The package was open, and it seemed like the glue was watered down. The glitter did not stick and there were no brushes. This was a present for my sister and we were both disapointed</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 6 year old daughter and she loved it! It really does stay on and looks great even days after. It was so easy to use, she was able to do it herself with different colors all in one tattoo! Removing the tattoo was easy as well. Only thing was the stencils are hard to put away. They&#x27;re sticky and couldn&#x27;t come up with a place to keep them flat and sticky.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by this product in that it actually comes with plenty of glitter and such so it can be used quite a lot before needing refills. It&#x27;s also very easy to use. My ten year old daughter figured it out with no problem and puts the glitter tattoos on totally by herself. They last a decent amount of time, too--depending on where you put them and whether or not you&#x27;re careful not to scrub them off while washing they can stay on a good week, but easily come off with baby oil.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old now has quite the collection of shimmer glitter tattoos stencils &amp; colors. They are all very similar in quality. At least the ones I have purchased. The kids have tons of fun with this.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this item.  It was smaller that I expected and arrived with the box somewhat crushed.  I did not return it, however.  Too much aggravation for a minor item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not order this again.</li>
    <li> nice set the only problem i had was the glue jar leaked about half of the glue out inside the package before we opended it.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our 10 year old daughter for Christmas.  I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.  I helped her put on tattoos 3 days ago and they are still there even after showering every day.  They are really pretty easy to apply too.  I reviewed these prior to buying them and say others complain about mess and using up the glitter, plus stensil only lasting one time.  First we got the stensil out which is covered on the top and back with film that has to be removed.  The stensils are like a rubbery type of material and you can easily make them last more than once.  I gently peeled the backing, applied it to my daughter&#x27;s skin and then applied the glue.  First suggestion is do not go crazy with the glue.  Just apply a light layer to the skin and try not to get much on the stensil.  Once the glue is on you remove the stensil.  If you are careful you can easily remove them and use again.  I just put them on the backing I peeled them from and waited for the little bit of glue I got on them to dry.  Then we put right back in her pile of stensils to use again.  Sure, they&#x27;ll lose their stickiness, but you could easily have your child hold it there (or someone else if you&#x27;re applying yourself) even when it doesn&#x27;t stick since you are only leaving it on long enough to get the glue on.  Once you take off the stensil you wait for the glue to dry from white to clear.  That doesn&#x27;t take very long.  Then you apply the glitter.  It is easy to apply the glitter and you don&#x27;t have to go through a ton of it.  Just blot it on like it says to do.  If you just apply the tip of the brush in the glitter, blot/dab on the part of the glue you want that color, it won&#x27;t take much.  Just use a little at a time and get more if needed.  Not every speck of glitter will stick and some will fall off around the tattoo or on your child&#x27;s skin.  I actually just brushed it with the brush and kept using it.  Then we just wiped the brush with a paper towel and went on to the next color.  In between colors I also just blew on her skin to blow away loose glitter.  Once we were totally done I just lightly brushed my hand over the tattoo to wipe away excess glitter and it didn&#x27;t bother the tattoo at all.  Her tattoos look great and she was really happy.  It says they last 3-7 days and so far they&#x27;ve reached the 3 day mark.  If you take your time and do as it says you should have perfect tattoos.</li>
    <li> My daughters 8&amp;9 love it , it is a little messy. Needs adult supervision. Would recommend age 8&amp; up. Washes off easily.</li>
    <li> Daughter likes these, but they do not last very long. Supposedly they last for a week, but they lasted about a day and a half.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 9 year old daughter.  The tattoos are really nice looking and last for about 3 or 4 days.  Surprisingly not as big of a mess as I was expecting either.  My only problem with this product was the stencils.  You can only get one good use out of them.  We have tried to reuse them but they are sticky and lose their shape so the tattoos really only look their best on the first use.  So once the stencils have been used you are left either trying to freehand a tattoo or going out to buy more stencils.</li>
    <li> These tattoos came as advertised but were hard for my daughter to use and didn&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
    <li> They are vibrant, work well .. last a long time for a shimmer/glitter and she loves them .. and they have gone a long way .. I think she has tattooed half of the middle school .. :)</li>
    <li> I got this for my 8yr old for Christmas, and she LOVES LOVES LOVES it!  Easy to use and looks nice for a decent amount of time!</li>
    <li> 1-Glitter leaked all over the inside of the package.&lt;br /&gt;2- The glue bottle was half empty.&lt;br /&gt;3- Did not work very well.</li>
    <li> Great item. My nieces love it. It&#x27;s easy to put it on. It comes off easy. They look really cool.</li>
    <li> The tattoos do not even stay on for one day! My daughter wore her tattoo one day and it came right off!!</li>
    <li> Got this for when my nieces are in town next month. The instructions are pretty straight forward, but the claim that the tattoos stay on for 7 days with normal use is a bunch of crock. If you shower and actually wash yourself, that is going to be coming off in about 4 days. Not all of it, but enough to make it look nasty. It&#x27;s cute, I will use it til it&#x27;s done, but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately because this item arrived damaged I couldn&#x27;t give a fair assessment of it.  Unfortunately I ordered this as  gift for my granddaughter and couldn&#x27;t give it to her.</li>
    <li> My daughters love these. They last quite a long time!</li>
    <li> This product was of good quality and it arrived on time.  This product met my expectations and my daughter liked it.</li>
    <li> my older granddaughter just loves this product, tattoos last reasonable time and remains easy to remove. just as advertised and great gift</li>
    <li> I purchased some for christmas and reordered because we just loved them, but they were different.  The glitter was much larger flakes, the application brush was poor, and the glue was watery.  My first batch of shimmer the tattoos lasted for weeks, which the new ones they did not last a day.  So sad because we loved them.  I will be contacting the company. They had a great product and ruined it.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have three children and they also love it. It was fun to use and we are all very happy with it</li>
    <li> Received the order intact, however the glue was congealed. Useless product without the glue. We tried many things to get the glue to soften but nothing worked. This was for a birthday party and needless to say, the kids were pretty disappointed. Can&#x27;t recommend this product. Would give zero stars if possible. If you purchase this I recommend having a backup plan.</li>
