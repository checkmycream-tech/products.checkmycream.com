      <li>I&#x27;m not too impressed with this oil.</li>
      <li>I loved it!  </li>
      <li>This oil smells great and It lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>Happy to find it again.</li>
      <li>Great aroma oil used as a perfume</li>
      <li>It was a great buy and a good quality.</li>
      <li>Really loved it</li>
      <li>is a product i have loved for 30 years.</li>
      <li>Great price, nice scent.</li>
      <li>Love this scent and this brand!</li>
      <li>Packaged nicely, smelled great, shipped quickly</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fortunately I have this lovely plant in my yard and can smell it throughout the summer.</li>
      <li>I bought several of these oils and this was the best of the bunch.  </li>
      <li>They have changed the formulas since the 1970&#x27;s and there are better blends available.</li>
      <li>I know the smell of honeysuckle and this just didn&#x27;t fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>But hey, Spiritual Sky always has very nice oils.</li>
      <li>the smell is not bad - it&#x27;s just not honeysuckle.</li>
      <li>and I notice that Spiritual Sky has a warm undertone to their scents which makes it something special to wear.  </li>
      <li>Sweet and pretty close to real honeysuckle flower</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like incense and not perfume.</li>
      <li>Not like the original spiritual sky.  </li>
      <li>Maybe my expectations were too high?  </li>
      <li>Delivered fast and professionally packaged.  </li>
      <li>I ordered a few more after I tried this one on, because I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
      <li>Gave it 2 stars because the weak scent it does have is very nice and is definitely honeysuckle.  </li>
      <li>It came off as a little more flowery than I had hoped because the honeysuckle flowers I have been exposed to in NC have a very faint flower aroma with a fairly strong sweet overtone (plus they&#x27;re fun to eat 0.o).  </li>
      <li>I missed it so much and finally found it on Amazon.  </li>

    <li> Love this scent and this brand!</li>
    <li> Delivered fast and professionally packaged.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t been exposed to the different honeysuckles that exist?(are there different ones?)  It came off as a little more flowery than I had hoped because the honeysuckle flowers I have been exposed to in NC have a very faint flower aroma with a fairly strong sweet overtone (plus they&#x27;re fun to eat 0.o).  But hey, Spiritual Sky always has very nice oils.</li>
    <li> Sweet and pretty close to real honeysuckle flower</li>
    <li> is a product i have loved for 30 years. Happy to find it again. It now sits on my dressing table.</li>
    <li> Packaged nicely, smelled great, shipped quickly</li>
    <li> This is a a very weak scent that does not last.  Not like the original spiritual sky.  Gave it 2 stars because the weak scent it does have is very nice and is definitely honeysuckle.  Just not enough.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> not a true honeysuckle smell</li>
    <li> Great price, nice scent.</li>
    <li> I lived in the south, and had honeysuckle bushes all around me while playing outside as a child.  I know the smell of honeysuckle and this just didn&#x27;t fit the bill.  Maybe my expectations were too high?  I don&#x27;t know - the smell is not bad - it&#x27;s just not honeysuckle.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these oils and this was the best of the bunch.  They have changed the formulas since the 1970&#x27;s and there are better blends available.</li>
    <li> This oil smells great and It lasts for hours.I will buy this product again.It was a great buy and a good quality.</li>
    <li> Great aroma oil used as a perfume</li>

    <li> I was looking forward to the arrival of this perfume but was very disappointed after smelling it. It smells exactly like incense and not perfume. I also didn&#x27;t smell any honeysuckle. I&#x27;m throwing it away.</li>
    <li> This scented oil is just O.K. but  does not capture the honeysuckle scent that I so long for.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I have this lovely plant in my yard and can smell it throughout the summer.</li>
    <li> Like several other reviews, this one smells like regular incense, nothing like honeysuckle. I suspect the seller fill the bottle with wrong thing.</li>
    <li> This does not smell like honeysuckle.  I&#x27;m not too impressed with this oil.</li>
    <li> My friend always talked about &amp;#34;spiritual sky&amp;#34; oils and this is indeed everything he says it is. Really loved it</li>
    <li> I bought this product eons ago.  I loved it!  I missed it so much and finally found it on Amazon.  I bought it back when the cap was square like the bottle, which might date me.  The scent is weak and although it resembles honeysuckle, it is not what it used to be.  I was greatly disappointed.  They must have changed their recipe or something.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
