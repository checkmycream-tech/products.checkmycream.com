      <li>Love this hair gel.</li>
      <li>he has beautiful curly hair, and it keeps it looking good all day without being overly rigid or flaking like other brands.</li>

      <li>and I got a lot of build-up and residue, unlike the Paul Mitchell Clean Gel I used.  </li>
      <li>a pretty strong paraben, phalate free styling gel, if you have spikes or are a guy.</li>
      <li>Because of the very high humidity yesterday, my curly hair was more frizzy than curly.</li>
      <li>It would be nice, if you call yourself natural and brag about your &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I have no complaints, but since I need a stronger hold, I will go back to my beloved Giovanni Magnetic Attraction Styling Gel for curl setting.</li>
      <li>Not only is this gel better, but it&#x27;s cheaper and you get more.</li>
      <li>its nice and strong and goes on fairly dry.  </li>
      <li>While the Paul Mitchell Gel doesn&#x27;t claim to be natural it does do a better job of not creating build-up and residue.  </li>
      <li>I love that its natural and</li>
      <li>I had run out of my Pantene Gel and wanted to find a gel that had no dangerous chemicals in it.</li>
      <li>We like how there are more natural ingredients used.</li>
      <li>The hold is good, although you might need to use a decent amount to make it last through the day.</li>
      <li>I have slightly thinning hair, and wanted to find a gel I could use that had good hold, but could also help in my ongoing battle with the receding hairline.  </li>
      <li>Holds my natural wavy hair even in the wind and is easy to style with.</li>
      <li>The best product for active teenage sons who are particular with their looks and this product delivers.  </li>
      <li>and then fluff to get a nice hold that doesn&#x27;t look like plastic.</li>
      <li>I use this to hold up a mohawk-like hair style, and it&#x27;s strong enough to keep my hair sticking up (a couple of inches tall) but still looking wavy.</li>
      <li>i would have to say i really like it.</li>
      <li>product itself is nice as it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky in my hair after a few minutes of it settling in.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this hair gel back in the day because it was organic.</li>
      <li>Older tubes of this gel that I have do not show parabens, but ingredients labels online do show them.</li>
      <li>This works very well for natural curly hair to control the frizzies.  </li>
      <li>This is only OK for guys (I&#x27;m a girl and have long hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick, effective, and not stuck in a bunnies eyes to see if it burns them.</li>
      <li>As others have noted, it dries a bit &amp;#34;scrunchy,&amp;#34; but quickly works out and leaves good hold without a dirty appearance or feel.</li>
      <li>I do not like the new line of LA Chic gel from Giovanni.</li>
      <li>i like it because it is totally natural!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also not hard or crunchy after you run your fingers through it, and once it dries, my hair feels soft even though it&#x27;s still holding up.</li>
      <li>Natural huh?  </li>
      <li>I recommend that styling gel because it contains natural ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t affect the efficiency.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s completely natural</li>
      <li>It offers all day hold.</li>
      <li>Anyways, Giovanni is about as natural as Pamela Anderson&#x27;s chest, let&#x27;s not kid anybody.  </li>
      <li>Do these ingredients look natural... VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to call yourself natural shouldn&#x27;t you be...</li>
      <li>I love this hair gel---I have thin, straight hair</li>
      <li>In fact, the curls were flat and not formed very well.</li>
      <li>It gives him a nice firm hold, but it isn&#x27;t so firm that it makes his hair a hazard to touch.</li>
      <li>I figure it certainly can&#x27;t hurt to apply these ingredients daily, particularly when the alternatives contain chemicals with unknown effects on health in general, and hair growth in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No heavy chemicals or residue from using daily.</li>
      <li>I use a lot of it for work and this stuff is kind of expensive.</li>
      <li>disappeared leaving me with a head full of soft curls, plus my hair looked as though it was twice as thick as it did earlier in the day!</li>
      <li>In comparison with Giovanni Magnetic Attraction Styling Gel, the L.A. gel has a little less hold but is more flexible and &#x27;moist&#x27; feeling when dry.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very different from other gels I&#x27;ve used in that it actually seems to make my hair looked much healthier.</li>

<li> no colors or other scary chemicals soaking into his skull :)</li>
<li> After I got home with my new purhcase, I scrunched a little bit of the gel mixed with a little water on my hair, which had been washed earlier in the day.</li>

<li> To freshen it up during the day, I use a little water on a comb and follow the above.  </li>
<li> He has been using Giovanni religiously for a few years now and has no intention of switching brands.</li>
<li> I like this stuff because I can rub it into my wet hair after a shower and things stay in place.</li>
<li> Although if you&#x27;re going for the wet look, just use a little extra and you&#x27;ll definitely end up with the stiff wet style.  </li>
<li> You can put it in your hair wet or dry, but I think I prefer putting it in wet because it takes less gel and looks tidier.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients like other hair gels.</li>
<li> BUT it left my hair hard and crunchy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this hair gel---I have thin, straight hair and it helps keep the curls in and helps when using a curing iron as well.  I do not like the new line of LA Chic gel from Giovanni.</li>
    <li> This gel helped define my 3c/4a curls BUT it left my hair hard and crunchy. I love that its natural and I was looking for a cheaper KCCC alt but I wont be reinvesting in this product. On to the next gel...</li>
    <li> I love this hair gel and it&#x27;s at a  great price, especially if you sign up for the Subscribe &amp; Save program!</li>
    <li> Great product. Provides wonderful hold for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was on the hunt for a safe and organic hair gel to be hanging around my face all day every day (how it is that people overlook such health risks is beyond me). I gave this a shot and wasn&#x27;t too satisfied at first. But after using it for a while it grew on me. It&#x27;s very different from other gels I&#x27;ve used in that it actually seems to make my hair looked much healthier. It did not make my curls crunchy at all. It gives nice volume and healthy shine! It has no intrusive strong smell, either. I&#x27;m very impressed. I plan on repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Holds my natural wavy hair even in the wind and is easy to style with.</li>
    <li> These sell for about $10 at Whole Foods, so ordering in bulk has been great!  What else can you say about gel, it holds your hair well?  Nice to know that it is not tested on animals as well.</li>
    <li> This works very well for natural curly hair to control the frizzies.  It will not be stiff as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product yesterday afternoon. I had run out of my Pantene Gel and wanted to find a gel that had no dangerous chemicals in it. This one surely seems to be the one! Because of the very high humidity yesterday, my curly hair was more frizzy than curly. In fact, the curls were flat and not formed very well. After I got home with my new purhcase, I scrunched a little bit of the gel mixed with a little water on my hair, which had been washed earlier in the day. The gel was not sticky, but my hair did feel a little \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; when the gel dried. I scrunched it a little and the \\&quot;crispiness\\&quot; disappeared leaving me with a head full of soft curls, plus my hair looked as though it was twice as thick as it did earlier in the day! I was very, very pleased!</li>
    <li> I place it on my hair and comb into place. After it dries, I comb again and it makes my hair look thicker and manageable.  To freshen it up during the day, I use a little water on a comb and follow the above.  Great product for me.</li>
    <li> Great gel for thinning hair.all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Started using this when Kiss My Face changed the formula and size of their hair gel. Not only is this gel better, but it&#x27;s cheaper and you get more. The gel has a nice consistency, works easily into your hair and has good hold. Don&#x27;t know that I trust it&#x27;s completely natural but I don&#x27;t see any scary-looking ingredients. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My fav hair gel for my curly frizz hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for 5 years now.  I use it with Giovanni Frizz Be Gone and it&#x27;s the best combo for my curly, frizz prone hair.  It provides the right amount of hold without the bad wet look.  Although if you&#x27;re going for the wet look, just use a little extra and you&#x27;ll definitely end up with the stiff wet style.  Overall this is the only gel I recommend.</li>
    <li> This gel is relatively inexpensive. It offers all day hold. The fragrance is wonderful. My fiance has been using this for years. He prefers it to several premium gels.</li>
    <li> My husband only uses this gel. He is very happy with the hold and is picky about his hair products. We like how there are more natural ingredients used. We have a hard time finding it in stores so we are happy to purchase on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use this to hold up a mohawk-like hair style, and it&#x27;s strong enough to keep my hair sticking up (a couple of inches tall) but still looking wavy. It&#x27;s also not hard or crunchy after you run your fingers through it, and once it dries, my hair feels soft even though it&#x27;s still holding up. You can put it in your hair wet or dry, but I think I prefer putting it in wet because it takes less gel and looks tidier. Also, I thought I was only getting one tube but actually you get three. After a month, I&#x27;m not even through one half of one tube. There is a slight smell to it (that isn&#x27;t bad) until it dries, and then there is no smell. This product is awesome!</li>
    <li> its nice and strong and goes on fairly dry.  i would have to say i really like it.</li>
    <li> I love this gel. It&#x27;s thick, effective, and not stuck in a bunnies eyes to see if it burns them.</li>
    <li> The best product for active teenage sons who are particular with their looks and this product delivers.  No heavy chemicals or residue from using daily.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this gel and loves it. It gives him a nice firm hold, but it isn&#x27;t so firm that it makes his hair a hazard to touch. In the past he was using American Crew and that seemed to cause flakiness if he touch it too much. This gel does no such thing. He has been using Giovanni religiously for a few years now and has no intention of switching brands. It&#x27;s a great gel with the added benefit of no toxic chemicals. Win win here.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, lots of it, but it&#x27;s very fine and this gel works wonders, keeps my hair fuller, wouldn&#x27;t go without it!</li>
    <li> Love this hair gel. I use a lot of it for work and this stuff is kind of expensive. Found this for a great deal and on prime. It doesn&#x27;t have harmful ingredients like other hair gels.</li>
    <li> this is the only gel my stepson will use! he has beautiful curly hair, and it keeps it looking good all day without being overly rigid or flaking like other brands. In the past few years he has gotten quite a few comments asking which gel he uses, and now 2 of his friends use it too. i like it because it is totally natural! no colors or other scary chemicals soaking into his skull :)</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and this clear gel is a perfect fit to get the most out of my bob.</li>
    <li> The latest ingredient list shows this product contains Methylparaben and Propylparaben.  Studies have shown that Parabens mimic Estrogen in your body.  Estrogen is believed to drive the growth of cancerous cells.   Older tubes of this gel that I have do not show parabens, but ingredients labels online do show them.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding gel that actually work for my mixed hair type (mixed girl). This is perfect. It give me a hold without being crunchy. I also appreciate that this product has not been tested on animals, which is unbelievably hard to find.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this hair gel back in the day because it was organic. That appears to have dropped off the label now, but it&#x27;s still a good product. The hold is good, although you might need to use a decent amount to make it last through the day. I have short hair, no longer than 2inchs and it probably takes me 1-2tbsp to create an all day hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is nice as it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky in my hair after a few minutes of it settling in. It&#x27;s not a super firm hold, and your hair will still be flexible with it in. My only complaint is the cost - its a little on the steep side for the amount you get but if you search for multi-packs and some discounts you can get the price down.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair looking like Dandruff.  BOOOOOOOOO</li>
    <li> Natural huh?  Do these ingredients look natural... VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol.  I don&#x27;t think so.  If you&#x27;re going to call yourself natural shouldn&#x27;t you be...can&#x27;t there be truth in advertising?&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I used this and I got a lot of build-up and residue, unlike the Paul Mitchell Clean Gel I used.  While the Paul Mitchell Gel doesn&#x27;t claim to be natural it does do a better job of not creating build-up and residue.  Anyways, Giovanni is about as natural as Pamela Anderson&#x27;s chest, let&#x27;s not kid anybody.  It would be nice, if you call yourself natural and brag about your &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; technology, if you actually lived up to it!</li>
    <li> This is only OK for guys (I&#x27;m a girl and have long hair so I don&#x27;t want my hair to look stiff as a board) a pretty strong paraben, phalate free styling gel, if you have spikes or are a guy. If you&#x27;re a girl, you&#x27;re going to be left with crackly stiff hair that looks as if you mixed bubble gum into your hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for fine hair..</li>
    <li> Always buy this hair gel, found it on amazon cheaper, so very happy.</li>
    <li> I recommend that styling gel because it contains natural ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t affect the efficiency. And the price is good too!</li>
    <li> I have slightly thinning hair, and wanted to find a gel I could use that had good hold, but could also help in my ongoing battle with the receding hairline.  This fits the bill perfectly.  The gel has lavender, rosemary, and thyme extracts, all of which are traditionally used to strengthen hair and encourage growth.  There have been studies on these ingredients indicating that daily use can help restore hair growth.  (See, for instance [...]  I figure it certainly can&#x27;t hurt to apply these ingredients daily, particularly when the alternatives contain chemicals with unknown effects on health in general, and hair growth in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the herbal ingredients, this gel just plain works.  As others have noted, it dries a bit &amp;#34;scrunchy,&amp;#34; but quickly works out and leaves good hold without a dirty appearance or feel.</li>
    <li> I had no build-up or flaking. Easy to wash out.  Doesn&#x27;t remove moisture from the hair. In comparison with Giovanni Magnetic Attraction Styling Gel, the L.A. gel has a little less hold but is more flexible and &#x27;moist&#x27; feeling when dry. This makes it great for defining tendrils, but not so great for curl setting a heavy mane of hair. No overwhelming smell (just a whif of the zesty lemongrass smell Giovanni products tend to have).  I have no complaints, but since I need a stronger hold, I will go back to my beloved Giovanni Magnetic Attraction Styling Gel for curl setting.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Cheaper tan store</li>
    <li> My favorite hair gel. I used to be able to buy this at Meijers, but it is no longer available. Holds hair firmly, but hair stays shiny.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff because I can rub it into my wet hair after a shower and things stay in place. I let my hair air dry and then fluff to get a nice hold that doesn&#x27;t look like plastic.</li>
