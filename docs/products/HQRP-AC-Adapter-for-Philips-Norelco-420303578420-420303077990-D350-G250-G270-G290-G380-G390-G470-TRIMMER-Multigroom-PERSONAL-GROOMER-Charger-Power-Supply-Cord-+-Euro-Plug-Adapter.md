      <li>If I could improve one thing about this item I would add a light to indicate charge status.  </li>

      <li>Product did not last more then a two week, charger was only used for 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a straight plug, so it won&#x27;t work with the charging dock originally included with my trimmer.</li>

      <li>It just charges mind numbingly slowly and for older devices like mine that are not holding charge that well in the first place, it&#x27;s mostly unusable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that it came with the little European converter.</li>
      <li>Once the battery started to die off, I new I needed to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br</li>

    <li> worked great with mine</li>
    <li> I thought the motor on my grooming kit was a goner, but thankfully it was just the cord that had gone bad. (Strangely, I&#x27;ve had a few cords/adapters go bad in recent year where they never had in years past.) The plug adapter for European plugs is a bonus.</li>
    <li> This product seems to plug into my razor, but doesn&#x27;t charge it.  Taking my original cord, cut from the original transformer and using another 1.6 Volt source charges the razor.  This one doesn&#x27;t fit right or something.</li>
    <li> While this charger does technically work, it does so extremely slowly. The current output must be much much less than stated because it can&#x27;t even provide enough to run the clippers while they&#x27;re plugged in. Expect to leave it charging for over a day to get something around a full charge. Really, just save yourself the pain and just get an official one from the official Philips site https://www.buyphilipsparts.com/item/9690521/Norelco/420303578420/Charger_W_Plug. It&#x27;s only $14 and the $3 difference is well worthwhile.</li>
    <li> it did not really work well. I would not buy it.</li>
    <li> as other reviews state, this thing is terrible.  The plug does fit the device I bought it for and it charges it.  It just charges mind numbingly slowly and for older devices like mine that are not holding charge that well in the first place, it&#x27;s mostly unusable.  We&#x27;re talking about leaving it charging for 1 day to get the equivalent of 5 minutes charge from the manufacturer&#x27;s charger.  maybe the power specs state as much, but for those of us not that familiar with power ratings and just looking at the plug type and voltage to recharge their stupid beard trimmer, this feels like a ripoff.</li>
    <li> This adapter was a great replacement for my son&#x27; beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> perfect fit at a great price,  thank you</li>
    <li> Since I left my charger at a hotel I had to replace it and this one works just great on my beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> it gets the job done..</li>
    <li> This is what I ordered, this is what I got. It&#x27;s nice that it came with the little European converter.</li>
    <li> I got what i wanted. Only that this iteam does not have a light to show that its charging otherwise its all good</li>
    <li> I received it - took a little longer than I expected- and plugged it in to charge. It was fully charged with a couple of hours. I have only had it for a few days so I can&#x27;t really evaluate the charger for more than the first use.</li>
    <li> AC adaptor works quite well. The plug to the trimmer (receiving device) is a little loose in fit but otherwise works as it should.</li>
    <li> Super slow charger (days and days). The AMPS are all wrong for charging the razor - it says so right on the charger vs. the razor. Not for all razors it lists. For the $11, I&#x27;d just buy another razor - in fact I did and have one of these if you want it for your junk drawer.</li>
    <li> not pleased.. is nothing like the original it take to long to charge my razor, and there is no light on it to tell you when it&#x27;s charging, and if it is charged</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco G290 and ordere this charger cause I still can&#x27;t find the original changer at home, the only issue I had was that the tip that goes into the trimmer (the metal tip that puts current into the charge hole of the trimmer) was not long enough to charge the trimmer, so if you have this problem just get a razor blade and carefully trim about 1/8&amp;#34; off the plastic from the tip and it will now go deeper and fit the trimmer like it supposed to. Other than that it charges just like the original.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for a friend. These are tough to find in a store. I was actually looking for a charger/adapter. This is just the adapter, but that&#x27;s better than nothing. No problems with the product.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick shipping......thanks!</li>
    <li> While the charger fit the trimmer, it was niota direct replacement.  It could not be installed in the attachement carrier.  The original became part of the accessories holder and had a light on it so it could be seen charging.  This has no LED and the trimmer has to be stored away from the accessory hokder when charging.  It is also much bigger than the originalk.</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t work. You can immediately tell by the lightweight feel and cheap hard cord it is knock-off trash. DO NOT BE FOOLED. There is no possible way this product can work.  I didn&#x27;t just get a dud.  All the 5 star reviews must be concocted.  I have had it charging for over 24 hours and it fails after about 10 seconds every time I try to use my razor.  Says it is the correct voltage but the current must be off. Also, another reason it does not--and cannot-- charge correctly is because none of the product is toleranced correctly.  The male wall outlet prongs are too small and slop around in the wall outlet which is a fire hazard, and the male trimmer end isn&#x27;t toleranced well either.  Save your money.  This will do nothing for you at all.  It is trash.</li>
    <li> Excellent device.  Meets my needs and has an included adapter to allow use on European power. (Unexpected bonus)&lt;br /&gt;Delivered quickly and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Great merchandise. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It sucks.. takes forever to charge!!!</li>
    <li> For what ever reason, this charger was not included in the original kit (sold separately). It charges just fine, but you will not be able to run your groomer off its power alone.</li>
    <li> works as it suppose to work</li>
    <li> quick shipping and does what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> Charger does not charge well at all.  Had it plugged in all night and was barely charged enough to run for 10 minutes.  I checked output with a volt meter and it is putting out 1.6 VDC, but for some reason it will not charge quickly.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I needed and has worked very well.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement charger for a trimmer that I lost the cord.  Kept me from buying a new trimmer.</li>
    <li> I accidentally threw away the charger for my trimmer and thought I&#x27;d just need to buy a new complete set, so was really glad to find this replacement charger.  Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am a goatee wearer and as much as using trimming scissors can be a good mediation practice.....using an electric groomer is WAAAYYY easier.&lt;br /&gt;Losing my AC adapter during a vacation I gave up on having this and starting looking at buying another all together. On a whim I searched Amazon (my go to for just about everything these days) and sure enough.....a very cost effective replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived today as promised, is sturdy...well made and after testing it out....it is charging!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> came as expected and very helpful</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and works fine.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for a great working charger.  :-)</li>
    <li> Exactly the Item I Needed</li>
    <li> It is great. Just what I was expecting. Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> just what was needed to keep the trimmer going at a good price</li>
    <li> It worked well, just looked like cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> Not a great charger. It takes well over a day for it to fully charge my beard trimmer (Norelco G380).</li>
    <li> Product did not last more then a two week, charger was only used for 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good product</li>
    <li> came in handy right when i needed it since I left my other one plugged in at my old apartment and behind when i moved.</li>
    <li> This charger works great and met all of my needs. It would have been nice to have had a indicator light on it ike the orginal one, but, very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> My old charger broke about two years ago and I&#x27;ve been limping by on the remaining charge since. Once the battery started to die off, I new I needed to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;- Charges without any overheating or other suspect symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;- Includes a European-style adapter (if you need that kind of thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a straight plug, so it won&#x27;t work with the charging dock originally included with my trimmer. It uses a right-angle plug to get around this.</li>
    <li> I had lost my other power cord in a move this was so easy to find very fast shipping</li>
    <li> I really needed this charger! Bad!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe the original packaging included the euro plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, very very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome replacement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, very very nice</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product worked. I originally lost my 1st charger and this is a great replacement.</li>
    <li> This does not fit to my Philips Norelco G370 kit.&lt;br /&gt;The pin or connector was little longer than the original, still I tried this charger. But didnt charge to my device.&lt;br /&gt;There is no light or indicator on the charger.</li>
    <li> We have the Norelco shaver but misplaced the AC adapter to charge it.  Just what we needed to use the Norelco shaver again.</li>
    <li> I searched all over and couldn&#x27;t find the charger for my Norelco G380 and this shaver is a must have for my facial hair.  This HQRP charger made a good replacement.  If I could improve one thing about this item I would add a light to indicate charge status.  Other than that, it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> No charge light or instructions but seems to do the job.  European adaptor was a nice, unexpected addition.  Charger is satisfactory.</li>
    <li> excellent for nextbook 8</li>
    <li> This charger is very good product for recommend, i use for charger my machine without problems and this working fine.</li>
    <li> hard to find part but worked fine  shipped on time  thanks again</li>
    <li> Best replacement adapter ever</li>
