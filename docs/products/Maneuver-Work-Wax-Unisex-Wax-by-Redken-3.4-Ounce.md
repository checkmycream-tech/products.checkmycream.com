      <li>Product was pretty good.</li>
      <li>I found I could manipulate the product better with damp hair (think lightly towel-dried).</li>
      <li>recommend applying with hair slightly wet for best results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells nice and has the right amount of hold.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best wax. Smells good!</li>
    <li> Great hair wax , and not crazy expensive ! All you need is alittle. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Very weak hold. I returned it because it didn&#x27;t keep my hair where I wanted it.</li>
    <li> FAKE, EXPIRED, or COMPROMISED product.  I was concerned that when I bought the product it was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  There were little beads or chunks in the wax, and the wax itself light.  I put the product in my hair, and these little beads wouldn&#x27;t blend or dissolve.  Finally, I got my stylist to order me one from her distributor and sure enough, it was a completely different product.  Smooth, even consistency, and it blended perfectly into the hair.</li>
    <li> I like how easy it is to care for my hair. After shower, I apply nickel size of working wax spread over both of my palms and just slide my hands into my hair. It holds without hardness and gives my hair some texture. I can rework it with some water later in the day. It doesn&#x27;t make the hair hard like gel or hairspray nor would it have hold like super hold gel either. It just lets the hair grab on by giving that needed texture.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Not very strong and not very weak. Does not leave oily and messy. Does not leave strong and sticky hair also. The hair is left natural and soft. Lasted the whole day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not as much of a fan of this product as other reviewers.  It essentially does what it promises -- provides a strong hold and is reworkable, without flaking.  However, I tried the Maneuver Working Wax as a substitute for Redken Water Wax.  The Maneuver Working Wax offers a stronger hold, you can rework your hair later in the day with a little bit of water, and there is more of it so it lasts a little longer (but you have to use more per day).  However, I like a softer hold, and I don&#x27;t like the look or feel of this product in my hair.  It causes hair to look and feel a little dull and crunchy, and when you run your hand through your hair, it definitely feels like there is product buildup (a little sticky).  It all depends on what you&#x27;re looking for: if you&#x27;re going for a strong hold or doing some bold styling, this might be just what you need.  But if you just want to control some frizz and give your hair a little sheen or style, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> Best product out there!</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all, good smell</li>
    <li> I have been using Redken Maneuver Work Wax for a few years now and it is my favorite styling product.  It holds well yet isn&#x27;t stiff and I like the fragrance.  It&#x27;s a great product for men or women and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best men&#x27;s hair product I&#x27;ve found yet. I have short thin hair and this product works very well to give me the natural messy look. It has pretty good hold and minimal shine. Application is easy, you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done. A comparably good product is the American Crew pomade, but I prefer Redken as the A.C. gives a sticky feel if too much is used, whereas Redken doesn&#x27;t. I recommend both. Much better than cheap gel!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and the slightest breeze blows my hair out of control. So by using this product it adds body and holding power with out the hair spray look. I often have trouble finding this productr locally so Ihave to resort to purchasing on-line. I recommend this product to anyone who has fine hair they want to control. The secrect is to almost dry your hair, rub an amount into your palms until no product can be left seen. The with your fingures comb through yourt hair then using a comb finish.</li>
    <li> Good stuff; doesn&#x27;t look wet or greasy.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for me. I have really fine hair. I wear it a bit long. This stuff will allow me to use it wet, and as hair dries comb it a coupla times, then I&#x27;m good for the day. If I need to I wet and comb and I&#x27;m good to go again. gets a bit greasy if you try for two days without washing hair. i have tried other stuff and this works the best for me.</li>
    <li> The only thing for styling fine hair. Not greasy, not shiny, not heavy, not wet, not clumpy and it holds your hair in place</li>
    <li> I was using hair gel earlier but it never worked so well for me. I also felt the need to wash my hair before sleeping  everytime I used the hair gel. One of the benefit of this product is that you dont need to worry about washing hair at night. This also gives a firm hold.  One thing I would like this product to have is a shine along with hold which is currently missing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many pomade type styling products and this is the best I&#x27;ve used.  It has a white color, a near solid consistency, and pleasant scent.  I like to apply a bit to my palms and rub them together which renders it clear and then apply to my hair.  I have a wild cow-lick on my head and it adds some weight and control to prevent my inner Alfalfa from springing forward.  As it settles onto your hair over time, it compliments your own hair and scalp natural oils and has a light feel.  I have short hair so one jar lasts me months.</li>
    <li> This review won&#x27;t do you any good until you consider what you&#x27;re looking for in a hair product. I have fairly short straight hair, probably at most 1.5 inches at the top and very trim at the sides, and I like to wear it slightly messily, if that&#x27;s even a real adverb. Anyways, if you&#x27;re looking for something that provides a decent hold without that greasy or shiny look, this is it. Tames the wild mane but doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like a total d...oofus. Maneuver Wax also washes easily off your hands. My barber, a very rad dude who wields a straight blade with the finesse of a Renaissance painter, recommended this to me - and he did not let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you are searching for something for major spikes or a real weak hold just for minor styling, I would probably avoid this product.</li>
    <li> Work well &amp; stay in place. Easy to wash out. Have tried many other products with poor results. Will recommend</li>
    <li> Product was pretty good. My only qualm is that it seemed older than the stuff you would buy from a retail store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happily using this product for years.</li>
    <li> As my hair gets longer I like the product. Doesn&#x27;t really have an use on shorter hair as it doesn&#x27;t have any visual effect.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product my husband will use.  Does not make his hair hard like some products, but still has great hold.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a year. It is a little pricey but it is a solid product. It smells nice and lasts a tub few weeks. I would recommend this to people with short hair, male or female, if you like your fixed hair to remain plyable.</li>
    <li> Great for guys who have thin hair. It gives the impression the hair is thicker. If I went with a gel I would look totally ridiculous; probably the only hair-styling product I will use again. The only thing I do not like is that it losses its hold fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> I do think the name of working wax is a bit misleading when the consistency is more similar to a paste. The product feels nice and smooth and provides a good texture, but it is not something with much hold.</li>
    <li> This has something that causes it for me to stand out vs other products.  I am darker skin and I hate the dreaded forehead shine most products do.  This is one of the few and only products that doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look very natural. Stays fairly soft. Everyones hair is different but this is best for my curly medium thickness hair. It also has a clean smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years now and it always works well for me. It holds my hair well without it being stuck in place like gel or hair spray and is easy to wash out unlike other products like this.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this wax.  It holds his hair in place without being sticky or gummy.  It stays put all day. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female who wears a very short hairstyle. I&#x27;ve used maneuver wax for about 5 years. It&#x27;s great for the following reasons. It isn&#x27;t shiny bright like a gel. But it adds a nice shine to your hair. It holds all day long. I&#x27;m a p.e. teacher, I work out and lead an active lifestyle. I can go all day long, come home, and re-adjust my hair if needed. It&#x27;s not too sticky either. At first when you apply it, your hands get sticky but that&#x27;s not what it feels like in your hair. It&#x27;s a very firm hold. It has a neutral scent. They should market this for women too!</li>
    <li> This is my default styling product. It has just the right amount of hold but is easy to apply. I find the wax products tend to be too hard to emulsify in your hands and apply to hair easily. This is great for short and medium length hair for spiky looks or smoothed out preppy looks.</li>
    <li> It has a really nice smell. The hold of it isn&#x27;t that great, I have short to medium length thick hair and I needed to use a lot more than recommended in order to get my hair to stay up how I liked it. If you use this with shower dried hair then it gives a matte finish, but if you have dry hair it gives a glossier finish. I would buy again, but I&#x27;m still looking for another wax to use.</li>
    <li> Product worked great. My fine hair stayed put .  After trying many different hair gels without success, decided to give the experts a try. Glad I did. Completely satisfied !</li>
    <li> Excellent price on this stuff. It is harder and harder to find this produect as my salon has gone to Paul Mitchell products. This stuff smells very manly. I love to smell manly or the person I am with smell like that.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff and it&#x27;s not stiff, doesn&#x27;t flake off.  I have been using this for years.</li>
    <li> This stuff is ok.  I think there are two products that are better though.  First the benefits of this:  It washes out easily, it doesn&#x27;t gunk up on your hands or hair and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick hair and this stuff doesn&#x27;t do much more than a very light hold. I find two products are better.  1.  Jonathan Dirt&#x27;s texturizing paste and Axe&#x27;s pomade.  For thick hair (i&#x27;m half Indian and half Italian) this stuff is just too weak.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> My barber recommended this a few months ago and it has quickly become my favorite styling product. I hate men&#x27;s hair products that make your hair look wet/greasy all day. This wax disappears into my hair and keeps it looking polished and professional throughout the day. I run a fingertip&#x27;s worth of the wax through my hair after getting out of the shower. Really easy to work with and goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product and last all day!!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and has the right amount of hold. My stylist used this on me and I haven&#x27;t used anything else since.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have thick hair that always does whatever it feels like. I just wet my hair and put a finger-scoop size in my palm and rub it in my hair.</li>
    <li> Dries clear, not shiny, smells good, hair stays soft.</li>
    <li> Great Wax. This stuff is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m still trying to find other things I really like but everything falls short. This holds great and does exactly what I want. Don&#x27;t expect to be able to spike your hair with it. I have moderately curly hair.</li>
    <li> Pound for pound a good product at a great price. Doesn&#x27;t smell too strong or perfumey.</li>
    <li> I think this product is for fine/thin hair only.  My thick hair has proven to be too much for this medium strength pomade.</li>
    <li> Great hold and matte look, one of the best for the price. Slightly better hold for shorter hair than American Crew Fiber but not a huge fan of this scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maneuver Work Wax for the last two years.  It holds my hair in place with a natural look and if I need to rework my hair at the end of the day, I just run my fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product due to its ease of use, lack of a &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; look, and how long it holds my hair in place.</li>
    <li> Works well, smells great, and washes off easily. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like this wax.  It does as described. If you are looking for a natural look, this is the way to go.  I haven&#x27;t had a any real problems with the wax.  The only thing I wish is that it would hold a little bit more.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT! it is not sticky and it does not make your hair hard and crusty like other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many various hair products, gels, foams, sprays, and whatnot from cheap stuff to expensive. From light hold to heavy...nothing works on my thick stiff asian hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except this stuff. Somehow it doesn&#x27;t gunk up my hair and yet holds it in place.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hair product.  My favorite soft hold product I&#x27;ve used.  Leaves you with a dry soft hold (vs. the wet hard hold from gels). If you&#x27;re going to use a hair product, this is the manliest one to use.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband and he just pulled out the first one of MANY that I purchased because it&#x27;s such a good price. The maneuver is dry and old and doesn&#x27;t work. These will be going back.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work extraordinarily well in holding up my big hair. Does a decent job of making my hair flow in the general direction. No replacement for wax</li>
    <li> Full container (I saw complaints about half-empty containers from other vendors on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product a lot and have bought it from several places. I personally use it on my (female) blonde, long curly hair and I love it! I&#x27;ve used a lot of curl products in my life, but I find this one has a great, non-stiff hold that helps accentuate curls. Also has a masculine scent to it, but I love it because it smells like a sexy man. The scent doesn&#x27;t linger all day though, you just smell it when you first apply it.</li>
    <li> Works good on my old hair</li>
    <li> Great value as this jar will last 6 months, and is the only hair product my husband will use. Smells like men&#x27;s cologne and doesn&#x27;t make his hair crunchy. Very flexible hold.</li>
    <li> The only hair product I use.</li>
    <li> A great wax, at a great price.</li>
    <li> Came in on time. Great product.</li>
    <li> it was for a friend and he told me works really good and that then,y brand he likes, so I iked it</li>
    <li> This is my 5th jar of this stuff.  I use it everyday, it&#x27;s the only hair product I&#x27;ll use after I get out of the shower.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t dry stiff like some other stuff.  It&#x27;s good for wet or dry use, and is very workable and will not leave your hair greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Very good it hold the hair nicely smell good &amp; i like it so much but it abit expensive to ship to my country.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried  A LOT of different products, typically buying a product and only using it once. This is so far, my favorite out of all the products. My hair is straight, pretty full set of hair, tends to be dry and fro without product / water. I love this, inst hard or stiff, great hold and flexibility. I highly recommend. I also have been cutting my own hair for years and have done so for a few friends as well... soooooo I like to think of myself as a semi-stylist lol.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, keeps hair just right for hours.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like deoderant on hyperdrive! It&#x27;s too perfumy and overwhelming to the senses. I can&#x27;t address how it holds as I did not want to put it in my hair after I smelled it.</li>
    <li> Item and delivery was exactly as described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product works marvelously. I am a male and my hair often sticks up after washing or just from waking up with bed head. I found many good reviews of this product online so I decided to search for it. After looking in many stores I came up empty (I was trying to save on shipping before I found out about Amazon Prime). I ended up purchasing the product from Amazon and could&#x27;t be happier. This product works wonders! I just take a small gob of wax and push it through my hair and then pat it down where I want it down and pop it up where I want it up and it holds all day. Additionally, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look wet, clumpy and sticky like you get from a lot of other wax products. I also find that the smell of the Maneuver Work Wax is very good. It has a manly cologne-like smell that smells better than some of the actual cologne that I have. I highly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> This wax is alright, I tried it in different climates as well as with wet and dry hair. It&#x27;s really just your average wax, nothing more or less. Ok hold, average shine, stays put for a few hours after which you ll probably need to rework it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think \\&quot;maneuverable\\&quot; definitely has its advantages - this doesn&#x27;t make my hair brittle at all... But I was still hoping for a bit stronger holding power especially since it is a wax after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, I recently learned about parabens and discovered that this wax has it. If you&#x27;re like me and trying to go paraben-free, I&#x27;d recommend [[ASIN:B003XFSVWS Star Wax | Premium Pomade, Original, by Star Pro Line - 5 fl. oz. Jar (Latest Generation)]] - it&#x27;s basically the only decent one I m aware of right now. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s probably some other good ones out there, too... But Star Wax actually holds better than Redken, is still \\&quot;maneuverable\\&quot; (at least in my opinion) and they give you a nice size jar too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this wax is Okay, just think there&#x27;s some better ones out there.</li>
    <li> terrific on my shorter hair that likes to go in seven different directions! Keeps my scalp in good condition. I use it every day!</li>
    <li> Really this is a 4.5 star item? I have think asian hair. This wax does NOTHING for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t hold, it doesn&#x27;t last, it&#x27;s not a good product. You know how when you put water on your hair and the water dries your hair becomes what it looks like naturally without water, that is exactly what this product does. I like a firm lasting hold. There are SO MANY better products than this. Please use Bed Head B which is why it is a 4.5 star and #1 best seller because it will transform and hold your hair. Also redken high up wax is good. This cream is not good, I regret buying it, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with the rest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how well this thing holds throughout the day considering how light it is. I used to use American Crew fiber, which I didn&#x27;t like because of how tough it was to wash off my hands and it also didn&#x27;t hold up well at the end of the day. This Wax, on the other hand, washes off the hands easily and holds up strong all day. Love it</li>
    <li> If your are looking for a product to give your hair a great style without much trouble, this is the one!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle and apply.</li>
    <li> After the reviews, I was really excited about this product, but it doesn&#x27;t old the hair really well and give it a greasy look. I won&#x27;t buy it again. there are better options that are cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product for holding a stiff style in place.  We have used this for a Mohawk and it does a really good job.  It is called a &#x27;wax&#x27; and it holds like a wax, but the product is more of a cream base.  This is not a bad thing.  Though it holds as a wax, being more of a cream makes it a lot easier to wash it out of the hair.</li>
    <li> I struggled with finding a decent product for my dirty blond fine hair. Almost everything makes it look greasy and like I don&#x27;t shower within hours. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 or 3 years and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> granted I now shave my head. I used this product for the past 4 years and found nothing else works as good. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy and lasts for a very, very long time!</li>
    <li> I have gone through countless types of gels and have always done a simple stereotypical look with my hair. I never found anything I liked until this. This stuff works very well. It is not hard, flaky, crusty, nothing like that. It is perfect and allows for you to move around hair all day but still get good hold. It smells good too!</li>
    <li> This product has a decent medium hold with a natural looking shine. I found I could manipulate the product better with damp hair (think lightly towel-dried). It washes out fairly well with regular shampooing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman and use this hair product. It works much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried over the years and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The hold wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as I thought it&#x27;d be. I&#x27;ve gotten other waxes that were maneuverable but personally this one is a bit too much. I probably will try a different kind next time</li>
    <li> Great product.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Have been using Redken Maneuver for about a year now.&lt;br /&gt;The product provides a lasting hold without making my hair stiff or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend applying with hair slightly wet for best results.&lt;br /&gt;Usually get two at a time and have ordered from Amazon at least 10 times by now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no bro.  But this stuff rocks.  Long hold, smells good.  It only takes a tiny bit to do the trick.</li>
    <li> Good wax, but you have to put a lot to have the same fixation effect that other cheaper brands have</li>
    <li> Best styling hair product ever. It smells amazing, it holds all day, and it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Great product! Nice hold, but your hair does not become a helmut. Has a natural feel.</li>
    <li> Great product and received it fast</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t use it everyday. It holds my hair very well. You do need to make sure you work it in your hair properly and not leave clumps since it is like a wax. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. And smells good</li>
