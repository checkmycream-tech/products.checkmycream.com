<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product is very soft and malleable.  Did not receive at expected time but person contacted was very helpful and friendly  .Would order again.</li>
    <li> I just received my Ivory shea butter from Ghana, but the plastic container came cracked and the label on the top describe just African Shea Butter not Ivory. I ordered in Oct 25 e receive Nov 01. I will post here again about the product, I hope that works.</li>
    <li> I love this ivory shea butter makes your skin soft &amp; smooth. I will continue to order this product my kids love it to.</li>
    <li> I did not expect it to be as sticky as it is and the smell is horrible! It does not smell like nuts to me as some viewers have stated.  I&#x27;ve used shea butter in the past and do not remember this smell; however, I am pleased with the creamy version other times I&#x27;ve gotten shea butter it was in hard chunks.  I just ordered some mango butter yesterday; I am going to mix the mango butter along with a bit of coconut oil with this shea butter and see if I can get rid of that smell. :)  Also, my husband says he doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s real shea butter but with so many out there - how do you know?  I will see how the mixture comes out and if I like it, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> yes this is the best shea butter,this shea butter make my skin smooth and very &#x27;soft,its defferent from the yellow butter,realy love it,I also used it in my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter its creamy not greasy , I use it plain on my skin then at times I add coconut oil to the butter for my hair and skin</li>
    <li> I love it!! I bought it to use as a natural moisturizer for my skin. I can mix it with other natural products to personalize it to my liking. Has a light nutty scent to it, but what else do you expect when its derived from the seeds of a shea tree?? Noting bad to say about it, if you&#x27;re looking for good, unfiltered shea butter, look no further!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent purchase! The Shea Butter was of great quality and grade. The smell is wonderful and it is smooth and creamy. The consistency is that of whipped Shea Butter. I&#x27;ve yet to find any foreign objects in the container and that assures me it has been filtered good. It melts in your hands within seconds! Very pleased and will order more soon as I use Shea Butter to make my own hair butters.</li>
    <li> I have placed four orders for shea butter, all supplied by halal. one yellow and the others ivory and everytime I was sent totally different shea butter.  So beware that if you order once the next time will most likely be different in consistency and smell.&lt;br /&gt;All the shea butters I ordered on amazon came from The body butter store.&lt;br /&gt;I posted pictures of what I received and if shea butter is listed as \\&quot;filtered\\&quot; it is not unrefined and filtering removes many of the vitamins  naturally found in unrefined shea butter.  My jar was also cracked upon arrival, I paid $18. There was no safety seal on the container.  I have since obtained pure unrefined shea butter from a fair trade co-op in ghana.  I have to say there is no comparison!  The \\&quot;real\\&quot; unrefined shea is beautiful ivory color a bit solid but not hard and has a nutty smokey aroma.  It also melts quickly into skin and is not greasy like this shea butter.  The shea butter from halaleverday is very greasy when it melts in your hand like an oil was added to it.  The shea from halaleverday made my young baby break out in a head to toe rash, the real stuff did not do that.&lt;br /&gt;Make your own decision but do a little research before deciding where to purchase shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE READ, I KNOW IT&#x27;S LONG BUT I LEARNED A LOT AFTER RECEIVING SHEA BUTTER THAT IS NOT TESTED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first was yellow it came in chunks on a plastic container, this one was very smokey and stained my clothes. My second was this 32 oz ivory shea butter this was the best one, solid, ivory, and mild scent.  Melted nice into skin.  My third I ordered the ivory creamy in two 16 oz containers and I was sent yellow, which was very grainy and had a strong smokey smell, amazon resolved quickly. The fourth and last order was this 32 oz ivory shea butter, I ordered on the 4 th and received on the 10 th.  It looked melted, not as smooth as the last time and very smokey smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shea Institute has a great fact sheet all about what real shea butter is and the importance of testing, I learned that the government nor any other agency requires shea butter to be tested for quality and safety prior to selling.  It is simply good business to do so and it is voluntary. This is the only way to certify a grade for the shea butter.  So, if the shea butter is advertised as \\&quot;grade A\\&quot; it should display the seal of the American Shea Butter Institute.  If it states it is grade A but does not carry the shield of the American Shea Butter Institute it is not actually graded and that butter is considered Lotto Grade Shea butter.  This means you do not know what you have, it may be good, or it maybe your worst nightmare.  Laboratory testing will include a safety screen, shelf life determination, and size of bioactive friction. Untested shea butter undesirables include, products of rancidity, mold, yeast, bacteria, fungus, coliform bacteria, lead, mercury,and other undesirables. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE AMERICAN SHEA INSTITUTE...SHEAINSTITUTE.COM AND YOU CAN GOOGLE THEIR FAQ SHEET AND READ IT THERE FOR YOURSELF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short I won&#x27;t be ordering my shea butter again on amazon!  I will order thru coastal scents from now on!</li>
    <li> I bought Shea butter a year ago after I developed eczema on my skin and been using it since. my eczema is much better now but to be fair I&#x27;m using prescription cream as well. But over all my skin do feel different and better after I use Shea butter. I found the best and easy way to use it is after getting out of the shower and drying, I use my hair dryer to melt the top of the butter into liquid and use it all over my body before going to bed. Next day my skin look and feel better. I know many complains about the smell but personally I found the not so strong nutty sent to be pleasant and I don&#x27;t think people around me notice it.</li>
    <li> Saw a video on YouTube seeing that real Shea butter was ivory or off white and not yellow, I was  shocked b/c I bought an 8 oz of yellow shea butter at the beauty supply ,so I was determine to find some real ivory or off white Shea butter. I searched all over the net to find it, but had no luck, so i went to Amazon.com  and found it and I was excited, this is so creamy and soft and moisturizes my hair very well,(great size and great prize) .I would recommend this Shea butter for anyone looking for the real deal Shea butter for a great price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I really did like this more that the yellow shea butter. It goes on a little smoother and mixes well with lotion and hair products. You can tell it&#x27;s really shea butter. It somehow seems less greasy than yellow shea as well.  Enjoy</li>
    <li> I just got this tub of African Ivory Shea Butter in the package today. I must say, it is rather gritty in texture when you just rub the solid pieces on your skin, it was tedious... But as I warmed it more on my hands, it melted wonderfully and went on my skin smoothly. Remember though, LITTLE BIT, because I do regret getting carried away putting more of this on my hips and chest, they feel too saturated, just a little bit is enough! Like they&#x27;ve said: \\&quot;A little goes a long way\\&quot; I agree, this fatty nut butter is very concentrated, but it&#x27;s still worth using in any senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This IS better than cocoa butter, but I am used to cocoa butter. The smell of cocoa butter always will be my favorite, so I mix some of this with cocoa butter oil for a nice smell! &lt;3</li>
    <li> The best shea butter I have used is from Slice of Nature. But we use a lot of shea butter and wanted to save some money, so ordered this 32 ounce tub. I have some Argan oil that I mix in with the shea. First, if it is too hard, I simply set mine inside the oven with only the pilot light lit which is warmer than the rest of the house. It is easy to work with when warm. I use a smaller container to have creamed shea with oil. What I don&#x27;t care about this shea is some of it is a cream or ivory color with blotches of darker shea (light (but not super light) yellow). It might be because it is such a huge container &amp; more than one person&#x27;s work was added to the tub to fill it. It does have a somewhat natural but almost acrid smell to it which dissapates when rubbing into the skin. This shea is a good buy, just not top notch, but okay and good enough for our budget. It is creamy, not grainy, which is important to me.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter! It is really like putting melted butter on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and I like that it melts quickly. Provides instant moisture for my hair and skin. I us it in my daughters hair and it makes look shiny and supple.</li>
    <li> I purchased the yellow shea and it had too much of a nutty smell. Plus, it was not very creamy and hard to apply. This one is much better. Easy to apply and feels so good on my hands. Takes great care of my cuticles. I also use it under my eyes.   My son is using it for his eczema. I think it is working for him but he needs to apply it more often than he is doing.   The smell is a little nutty but it goes away and does not linger.   The texture is what I consider hard creamy. You can get it out but you still have to melt it in your hands for it to apply right.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea Butter and although it took forever to arrive...I would do it all again.&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter is good for your Hair, Skin, and best right out of the shower.</li>
    <li> This was the best Shea butter for the best price I could find. I am using it to help make lip balm and have not been dissapointed!</li>
    <li> After carefully reading the customer reviews, I decided to take a chance on this product. It arrived in time and was as advertised.    I find it a little greasy for my face only but I take care of that by applying a very small amount about 30 minutes or so before I go out.  I have no problems in applying it.  Rubbing a small amount between the palms for a few seconds works fine for me.     I have extremely dry skin and usually have to apply lotion several times during the day to avoid ashy looking skin.  In the 3 weeks of using the African Ivory Shea Butter, I no longer have to do so, one application is enough. A friend with whom I shared the product reported that her stretch marks have started to disappear.</li>
    <li> Lovely pure shea butter.  This is the lighter colored and scented ivory, as opposed to the darker and stronger yellow that you sometimes find.  Melts nicely for body butter, lip balms, etc.</li>
    <li> The product is some of the best Shea Butter I have purchase!  The cost was better than what I&#x27;ve found elsewhere however the quality was not compromised. Enjoying my Shea.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and it smells so good!</li>
    <li> I started using African Ivory Shea Butter from Ghana a few months ago because my pedicurist advised me too, since my feet was always a little dry when I visit the salon. I chose this brand and I/we have already seen changes , my heels aren&#x27;t dry anymore . My feet also had a couple of dark marks left by wearing strappy shoes and this product made them disappear.</li>
    <li> I bought this shea butter to take care of my skin. It works really well and makes my skin softer. It is a bit oily so just be aware of that and it works best buy rubbing in. I also use it on chapped lips and they tend to heal a bit faster than using chapstick-like products. The texture is obviously hard/ butter like, so it works best coming out of the shower and applying, but works either way.. just a bit more work. 1 jar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Used this Shea butter to make soap from scratch, very nice!  Can use on skin and hair, too!  Love it :)</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON&#x27;S ECZEMA AND IT HAS WORKED WONDERS IN JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS, IT HAS MADE HIS SKIN MUCH MORE SMOOTHER AND KOST OF THE ROUGH PATCHES ARE GONE. THIS IS AN UNREFINED SHEA BUTTER (NO ADDITIVES ADDED TO IT), SO YOU HAVE TO RUB IT IN YOUR HANDS FOR A FEW SECONDS TO GET IT SMOOTH AND IT IS A BIT STICKY BUT IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
    <li> Enjoy the texture, enjoy the price and enjoy the purity. My daughter is prone to extremely dry skin. I use this on her legs all the time and it definitely helps with the itching. My only regret is not using this during my pregnancy. I&#x27;m sure it kicks butt as a stretch mark deterrent.</li>
    <li> This wonderful product is actual African Shea butter.  For years I have been buying what was labeled in stores as Shea butter and it was yellow in color.  Recently I went to YouTube to find out the difference between the two.  There are a few clips of the African women actually making the butter from the Shea nut and in each case the finished product is ivory in color.  Another clip showed and African woman explaining the difference.  The ivory colored cream is real Shea butter.  The yellow is from a different nut and is African butter.  Both are good.  The Shea  butter (ivory) is richer.  It takes a very small amount to moisturize your skin.  It feels a bit gritty when you take if from the container but melts almost immediately into your skin, leaving a pretty, healthy glow to your skin.  Remember, a very small amount is needed.  Too much will be greasy.  Your skin will feel soft and supple.  I tried it on my hair and it is soft and manageable.  It has a slightly smoky smell so if you use it in your hair, use it sparingly and you may prefer to scent the cream with vanilla or some other fragrant oil.  The yellow is good but not as rich in emollients, takes longer to melt into the skin and does not last as long.  I also did not like it in my hair unless I mixed it with something else to thin it out.  I am a 57 year old Black woman with very dry skin and hair that I wear natural, if that information helps. Recommend this product very highly.</li>
    <li> love this product will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smooth and nice smelling. I mix with different essential oils and it smells even better.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not lumpy or gritty , it spreads on nicely and don&#x27;t stain your clothes like the yellow Shea butter. The smell is not over powering either. I am use to it and actually enjoy the smell now.</li>
    <li> I love love love this shea butter! It is light and creamy! I use this to make my facial products, lotions, and hair mixes.  It&#x27;s a all in one product.</li>
    <li> that doesnt lie about its product and send you that wannabe-shea-butter-yellow-stuff or the shea butter with the additive! this si exactly what i was looking for! pure shea butter!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner. Product is as described. Very creamy and moisturizing. I use it on wet skin, cuticles, lips, and ends of my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> Real African Shea butter is Ivory in color, not yellow. The yellow is a great African butter, too but it&#x27;s not from the shea tree. Not to say it isn&#x27;t good, I use both. But the ivory shea butter is less oily by just a little, but I like that. It&#x27;s a little lighter in texture than the yellow \\&quot;shea\\&quot; butter. You can use them both for the same things but I have to admit I usually go to the Ivory shea butter.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected at all! This shea butter is a true shea butter. I loved the nutty smell to it. But it was HARD as a Rock! Not creamy at all! It was so hard to work with. And when I melt it with oils, it left a sandy gritty feel to it. Had to throw it away. What a waste....</li>
    <li> I am in the process of changing to all natural products for bath and body. So far I have tried organic coconut oil, cocoa butter and other oils. This shea butter is my favorite so far! I like that it is thicker than oil but less greasy than cocoa butter. The smell does not bother me because it is all natural. I am getting rid of all my lotions with parabens, artificial colors and mineral oil.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in timely manner and in good condition.  However it was not Ivory in color but a yellow or light mustard.  The texture was creamy and had no awful smell which I had read in other reviews.  Made some very nice body butters for gifts with it.Whipped up to beautiful white.  I would probably order it again.</li>
    <li> I use this product and other natural products on my hair, Shea Butter is a great moisteriser for hair and body, and teh price for it was not high. It also has a less potent smell tahn the regular Shea butter</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product with out additives!!  If anyone has skin disorders then this is the product to heal, protect and maintain your delicate skin.  For a heal softener it can&#x27;t be beat.  The shea butter from this company does not have the smoke odor.  It is refined by a new method.  All the reviews that complain about the odor are probably getting product from a business that uses the smoke method to refine it.  This is NOT rancid nor does it have any odor at all.  Everyone who I have given samples to loves it.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.  Excellent product, fast shipping and superior customer service and information by phone.</li>
    <li> Non-staining which you sometimes get with the yellow -ish shea butter! Very Nice product I mix in coconut oil and make a wonderful mixture that leaves me skin so soft! People constantly comment on the glow of my skin. I use it in my hair and as a night cream during the winter months.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter! It is worth every penny that I spent on it why because it is the real Shea butter and not that yellow nut butter that you see in a lot of beauty supply stores. Also, it is very easy to work with once you learn what works best for you when working with the Shea butter. I mix my Shea butter with coconut oil and by doing this I get a nice creamy consistency. Trust me when I say that this product is going to last you a long time and the whole time you will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> OK, I love this product!  Let me start off by saying that I use it to moisturize my skin and hair.  However, when I ran out of Triple Paste ointment for my infant son one day, I decided to use this shea butter instead.  I&#x27;m glad that I did because it creates a great barrier in his diaper area and he does not get rashes on his VERY sensitive skin.  One does have to rub the shea butter in before applying but it melts easily.  His diaper area is so soft and rash free and not red at all.  I think that this is a great all over alternative with many uses.  In the cold winter months I use this on dry patches and it heals in about a day or two.  Great value for the amount of product that you get!</li>
    <li> I want to draw attention to the inconsistency in the description.&lt;br /&gt;This shea is listed as \\&quot;filtered and creamy\\&quot; yet the description categorizes it as Grade A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade A Shea is typically the shea renown for its healing benefits as it is considered raw or unrefined and has been extracted using only water. Grade A Shea butter is not filtered - at all.&lt;br /&gt;If this Shea is indeed \\&quot;filtered\\&quot; that renders it as REFINED shea butter - (aka no longer grade A.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure if this shea is indeed filtered OR Grade A.  I&#x27;m assuming someone made a typo somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a specific type, please be aware of this issue.&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I made!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best!&lt;br /&gt;~N</li>
    <li> I believe the Product Features, but this product has not have a nutty smokey aroma.&lt;br /&gt;It has a smell, like when you cook your bacon and you smell the rest of the fat! :((&lt;br /&gt;it melts in your hand like an oil was added to it.It does not smell like nuts to me.&lt;br /&gt;It is still on my skin 3 hours after I tried to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is mid-dry, and after I apply my macadamian cream, my skin sucks it into itself&lt;br /&gt;so deep, that I cant feel any cream on my skin 2 minutes later.</li>
    <li> It is really goooooood! Mine arrived fast, was tossed over the fence and the container cracked a little. The product&#x27;s benefits are whats described and more. Hair, skin, nails getting healthier with every use. My body feels really soft, smooth and light, it gives a warmth sensation that makes me relax. Gave my girlfriend a full body massage with this butter/ coconut oil combination, she felt so relaxed that I had to start some action before she fell asleep ;D. Oh, put some on your feet, it feels incredible. The oily sensation disappears after a few minutes as it is absorbed by the skin. The butter is not ivory white, kinda light yellow; has a nutty smell similar to cocoa, not strong, not rancid at all.&lt;br /&gt;All and All we are really pleased with this African Ivory Shea Butter/ black soap combination.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitively be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I purchased 32 ounces of ivory shea butter from Halaleveryday. The shea butter was packaged in a big, sturdy, plastic jar. The shea butter is ivory/cream/off-white in color, super creamy and smooth so it&#x27;s authentic. I use shea butter for my DIY Body Butter (shea butter/vanilla- infused coconut oil). It makes my skin soft, supple &amp; smooth. The price is right  -- $11.50 for 32 oz of shea butter ($0.35 per oz) -- so I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for 1 month. It lightened up the marks on my legs and even my stretch marks ( although I don&#x27;t expect a 15 yrs old mark too disappear). I&#x27;ll continue using even though. The scent is not loud like cocoa butter and if you work in an air condition area your skin remains moist all day. I&#x27;m glad i was introduced to this product.</li>
    <li> I chose to rate it five stars because it&#x27;s absolutely perfect! It&#x27;s lightweight, not as oily and dark as the supposed shea butter that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Super fluffy and soft! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants smoother skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it since I received it on dry patches on elbows, hands, feet and even face before bedtime. The quality is pure and healing. It is great help in the bitter dry winter this year in Jersey. I take off one star for poor quality of the plastic container. The rim broke off after times opening the lid and putting the lid back to the container. I&#x27;ll need to transfer the contents to cosmetic grade jar to preserve the freshness of the Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is wayyyyy Richer than the yellow kind. I just Received this 20 mons ago and I couldn&#x27;t wait to Put it on. I live on Florida so when they Delivered it, some of it was Melted a little. I took that and Rubbed it on my Strecth Marks. I have a 1yr old. I know this may sound Crazy but I thought I saw my Strecth Marks Demolishing right before my Eyes. I just love this Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always use this Product. The smell is not Bad. It smells similar to the yellow one to me, Just not as Strong. The Packaging was great !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Will Use this Product for Years to Come. I Truley love this Product.</li>
    <li> I received my pure Shea Butter yesterday afternoon and it is absolutely luscious! It is the true shea butter, so rest assured it is not one of those items that claim to be authentic. It is a gorgeous ivory color with the earthy/smoky aroma and the ease of getting it out of the container that assures it&#x27;s authenticity. All you need to do is slide your finger across the product to remove it for use, there is no need to scrape it or use a lot of pressure to remove it from it&#x27;s container.&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter melted into my skin and even as I write this review approximately 15 hours later, my hands  and arms are silky smooth. I only used it on my arms and hands to see if I would be allergic to it and I am fine, so now I will use on my face and body. It has a lighter \\&quot;oily\\&quot; feel to it than the African Butter that I reviewed  BUT I will still use that as well, I just need to see which is better for my psoriasis for each season.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would give this product an A+ for authenticity and moisturizing factors and its timely arrival! Enjoy it!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast product was smooth creamy and had a smokey nut smell to it came in a big tub for storage great buy altogether sharing this with the whole family will be buying more</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described -- 32 oz of filtered, unrefined, ivory shea butter packaged in a big, study, white plastic tub identical to the one pictured. It&#x27;s smooth, creamy and perfect for use in my homemade body butters. I will repurchase from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> I tried to mix this Shea butter with a lot of my favorite essential oils and other creams to make it more fluid , but the smell kept coming thru. Ended up throwing away.</li>
    <li> Extremely good value item. Good quality and economical for anyone who needs to use it lavishly.( As I do) Great for feet. hands. elbows and knees. It has lots of uses but thats what I got it for. I warmed it in microwave ( 30 seconds) in small quantity and added some pure lavender oil for its soothing quality. Also did the same with some tea tree for cracked heels.</li>
    <li> I really like this and have no problems using it. Alot better than using other products I have tried. Works on all areas of the body.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this Shea butter. It is a very good quality and smells amazing. The only reason I am not giving 4 stars is because the choice of shipping packaging caused my container to break when I opened it. It was wrapped in a bubble mailer and then placed inside another bubble mailer. I am splitting it into smaller containers anyway but for someone else this could be more of an issue. Shipping was fast and the product is of very good quality.</li>
    <li> I love to use Shea Butter as my primary moisturizer.  I have purchased this before and will likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not really a product to buy for its scent but rather its benefits. Great for moisterizing the skin and hair, as well as to treat psoriasis and other skin irritations.</li>
    <li> I use this for my skin.  It is fabulous for dry skin, small nicks, and cuts.  It takes the sting away and heals the skin faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was quick and this container is huge.  I use it for myself and give some to others.  This will last me quite awhile.  It is a great buy.  Also this is the shea butter that is beige/white in color.  I prefer this over the yellowish shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again from this company.</li>
    <li> I use this product in skin lotions that I make.  It is very healing to the skin and softens your skin wonderfully.  This is in most of your commercial skin products, but you know what is in them when you make them yourself</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SHEA BUTTER, IT IS THE BEST. I MIX IN MY JBCO, JOJOBA OIL,COCONUT OIL AND PEPPERMINT OIL AND USE IT ON MY NATURAL HAID IT MAKES IT SOO SOFT AND SILKY. I ALSO USE IT AS A BODY BUTTER MIXED WITH THE SAME INGREDIENTS I JUST MENTIONED ABOVE, IT KEEPS U MOISTURIZED ALL DAY. IT&#x27;S ALSO GOOD FOR SCARS AND DARK SPOTS. I LOVE IT,IT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> First time using the Ivory shea butter it seems creamier than the yellow.</li>
    <li> I received exactly what I ordered a lot of people that sale shea butter don&#x27;t have the real thing. It works great and my hair stays moisturize. I love it! Great job!</li>
    <li> We got this Shea butter from Ghana quickly and we are completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;easy to use container&lt;br /&gt;fresh consistency&lt;br /&gt;mixed well with our blend&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;none- we were pretty satisfied with this product and would recommend for others to use for their beauty needs.</li>
    <li> I CHOOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE YOUR PRODUCT SO GOOD  FOR ME AND I LOVE TO USED ON MY FACE EVERY DAY.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Shea Butter&#x27;s I have ever used.  It mixes well with other oils.  Used on it&#x27;s own it is creamy and absorbs beautifully into the skin or hair.  LOVING IT!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to buy but very glad I did. Weighs in at 33.14 so the extra 1.14 oz is accounted for the tub Which means it is exactly 32 oz as promised. Smells wonderfully faint and smells just fine oh and it is silky smooth! Very very glad I purchased this and will definitely  buy again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use it on minor irritation and inflamed skin. It really works well on dry skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my skin soft and reduce marks and wrinkles. so far it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This products is great for the skin.  Leaves it soft and you need very little to get the desired result.  It doesn&#x27;t have the nicest smell to it.  But, it&#x27;s not horrible.  Overall, great product and great price.</li>
    <li> I have always loved shea butter for helping my poor dry skin.  But I had never tried this product.  When I got it, I was surprised at the hard consistency of the product, however, once I started using it, on both my face and the rest of my body, I was hooked.  No more scaly skin on my legs or arms, and with 60 year old skin on my face, this stuff is better than the overpriced facial moisturizers I have used for years.  The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but that fades in a minute or so.  I would recommend this for everyone whose skin has seen better times!</li>
