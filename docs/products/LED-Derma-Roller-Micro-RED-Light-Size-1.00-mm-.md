### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The Derma roller by its&#x27; self is completely awesome and it works, but the addition of an LED is bogus.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>it takes time getting use to, but very good</li>
      <li>I have used it on my face but too soon to tell any great difference</li>
      <li>Great product...</li>
      <li>I just started using this, I think it works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I honestly sorta</li>
      <li>This thing is awesome, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Hurt more than I thought it would</li>
      <li>My skin appears to have a more youthful appearance.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the quality and effectiveness of this Micro Roller.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the light does much either, but it&#x27;s still a good quality roller.</li>
      <li>but my skin does glow more than normal.</li>
      <li>I hope to see more results with further use.</li>
      <li>Find out where to get numbing cream first then try it.</li>
      <li>The few times I did use it the redness went away by morning which was good</li>
      <li>I applied all the appropriate Vit C and moisturizers and they did sting a tiny bit, but nothing to really even comment about.  </li>
      <li>I Don&#x27;t really believe the light does anything because it doesn&#x27;t seem intense enough and</li>
      <li>the roller is actually in front of the light, blocks it.</li>
      <li>You really notice the difference when putting up serums and cream afterwards.</li>
      <li>LED Light went die after only using it twice.</li>
      <li>I FINALLY got enough courage to use it yesterday and it is NOT PAINFUL AT ALL!!!!, and I do stress this.  </li>
      <li>Red light makes my skin soft and supple.</li>
      <li>I have a high pain tolerance</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, so far seems to be working.</li>
      <li>BUT HAVE NOT HAD IT LONG ENOUGH TO SAY FOR SURE.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re frozen by fear of the impending pain, relax, it&#x27;s short lived and worth it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 65, so I think women of this generation will like to know how it works on mature skin...</li>
      <li>I have a scar on my arm that is raised and is about 10 years old.</li>
      <li>AND SO FAR IT SEEMS TO HELP</li>
      <li>If you are using a roller for scars you will have 1 to 2 months &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; before you see results that is the body&#x27;s natural timeline</li>
      <li>It is more reliable than other dermarollers that I bought from other sellers.</li>

<li> but I haven&#x27;t been able to do it regularly because it&#x27;s too painful</li>
<li> SO FAR AM STILL NOT SURE</li>
<li> I bought the red and plan on purchasing the green.</li>
<li> I dont see any change in my skin, no reduction is pore size, no fading of scars, no hair regrowth other than pricking sensation</li>
<li> I can see a slight difference already.</li>
<li> Odd little gadget.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll give an update after a few uses.  </li>
<li> I have used for over a month see no improvement do not recommend don&#x27;t waste your money .</li>
<li> Not sure it&#x27;s doing anything</li>
<li> Other reviews on derma rollers stated how painful they are to use, and I couldn&#x27;t get past that, so there it sat.  </li>
<li> and it already doesn&#x27;t feel as raised and tough.</li>
<li> I am confused.</li>
<li> If your serious about  maintaining your face from aging,,,,must have!</li>
<li> for the price you cant go wrong.</li>
<li> It had no lights, not the one in picture, disappointed!</li>
<li> but this was a very annoying pain</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think this works for me at all, I was trying to stimulate collagen, not heal.</li>
    <li> The delivery on time, but this roller was not as discribe. It had no lights, not the one in picture, disappointed! 😫</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the quality and effectiveness of this Micro Roller.  I have not been using it long enough to confirm effectiveness for removing wrinkles.  My skin appears to have a more youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> LED Light went die after only using it twice.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, so far seems to be working. Doesn&#x27;t hurt, it feels like you&#x27;re getting a facial massage every time I use it.</li>
    <li> (Wife) I purchased this derma roller and it sat in the cupboard for 2 weeks because I was too scared to use it.  Other reviews on derma rollers stated how painful they are to use, and I couldn&#x27;t get past that, so there it sat.  I FINALLY got enough courage to use it yesterday and it is NOT PAINFUL AT ALL!!!!, and I do stress this.  Yes, when you&#x27;re finished, your face is red and you have the feeling of a sunburn for about 25 minutes...the redness only lasted 15 minutes.  After that, nothing.  I applied all the appropriate Vit C and moisturizers and they did sting a tiny bit, but nothing to really even comment about.  So if you&#x27;re frozen by fear of the impending pain, relax, it&#x27;s short lived and worth it.  I&#x27;ll give an update after a few uses.  I&#x27;m 65, so I think women of this generation will like to know how it works on mature skin...I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
    <li> Five star rating, this product delivered its promise! I bought the red and plan on purchasing the green. If your serious about  maintaining your face from aging,,,,must have!</li>
    <li> I have used for over a month see no improvement do not recommend don&#x27;t waste your money . Do not buy.</li>
    <li> There was a big change on my facial scar since I used this item. It is more reliable than other dermarollers that I bought from other sellers. I&#x27;m really happy with the results. Thank you SGF.</li>
    <li> this product helps people with pain and it works for my hubby it takes time getting use to, but very good</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT SO FAR AM STILL NOT SURE ABOUT IT CAUSE I HAVE NEVER TRIED ANYTHING LIKE THIS. I AM OVER 50 AND STARTED TO BRAKE OUT ALONG MY CHIN, NOSE AND FOREHEAD. I COULD NOT BELIEVE AT MY AGE TO GET BLEMISHES AND NOTHING SEEMED TO HELP. I CAME ACROSS THIS ON AMAZON AND THOUGHT WHY NOT AND SO FAR IT SEEMS TO HELP BUT HAVE NOT HAD IT LONG ENOUGH TO SAY FOR SURE.</li>
    <li> The Derma roller by its&#x27; self is completely awesome and it works, but the addition of an LED is bogus. The LED does nothing and doesn&#x27;t speed healing in any way. If you are using a roller for scars you will have 1 to 2 months &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; before you see results that is the body&#x27;s natural timeline and you cannot speed it up.</li>
    <li> Odd little gadget.  Hurt more than I thought it would so I don&#x27;t use it.  I have a high pain tolerance but this was a very annoying pain and it just made my skin crawl.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a year and needed another one for when I travel...Great product...</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome, especially for the price. I have a scar on my arm that is raised and is about 10 years old. I honestly sorta gave up hope of it every going away.Ive been using this just a couple of weeks and it already doesn&#x27;t feel as raised and tough. Red light makes my skin soft and supple. Very happy with this purchase. Thinking aboutgetting the blue one for acne.</li>
    <li> I dont see any change in my skin, no reduction is pore size, no fading of scars, no hair regrowth other than pricking sensation i see anything here. Dont buy it</li>
    <li> I have used the .25 red one for 2 weeks. You really notice the difference when putting up serums and cream afterwards. I have used it on my face but too soon to tell any great difference but my skin does glow more than normal. Just purchased the .5mm to use once a week.</li>
    <li> It hurts. Not sure it&#x27;s doing anything but I haven&#x27;t been able to do it regularly because it&#x27;s too painful and I don&#x27;t have a numbing cream to use. The few times I did use it the redness went away by morning which was good but I still just couldn&#x27;t do it often enough to see results. I Don&#x27;t really believe the light does anything because it doesn&#x27;t seem intense enough and the roller is actually in front of the light, blocks it. It seems to be made well though and is sharp enough. Find out where to get numbing cream first then try it.</li>
    <li> I just started using this, I think it works great. I can see a slight difference already. I hope to see more results with further use. for the price you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> I use it as directed... I can&#x27;t actually tell if it&#x27;s beneficial or not, maybe it takes time. I will continue to use it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but does make my face red. I use a serum afterwards, and hope eventually I will see results. I don&#x27;t think the light does much either, but it&#x27;s still a good quality roller.</li>
    <li> Ummm what type of battery does it take? I tried AAA and no luck....I am confused. It works needlewise though.</li>
