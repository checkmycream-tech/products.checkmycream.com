<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this all the time to self-operate on my toenails. I have bad toenail genes, apparently, and it requires tools outside of the ordinary nail clipper. I consider this an essential piece to my repertoire to keep my toes and feet comfortable and not painful. I can&#x27;t live without this, honestly. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> A real waste of money.  On one foot you use them right side up but they do not cut thick nails.  On the other foot you have to try to cut with them upside down.  I do not recommend these...</li>
    <li> Have difficulty with ingrown toenail on ONE TOE only.  This clipper has eliminated the same clipping pattern and made the nail grown out to a normal shape.</li>
    <li> This clipper works well on your toes.  Helps to keep in grown toe nails under control</li>
    <li> These are good toe nail clippers and work very well.  I think everyone will use and like them also.</li>
    <li> There are nail clippers and there is this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nail clipper will clip your nail with a loud, metallic &amp;#34;CLICK!&amp;#34; and send that hard bit of your body across the room at twice the speed of sound, killing or wounding anyone in its path.  What?  Your nails aren&#x27;t like that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could kill prey with my toenails.  I&#x27;m followed around by envious velociraptors.  Werewolves come to me for grooming tips.  My walls have holes in them where my tempered steel-like toenails have shot through them.  My socks look like they were caught in the garbage disposal.  I use SIDE CUTTERS to cut my nails - and have broken two of those side cutters in doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have toenails from Hell.  Ask my wife.  She&#x27;ll tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m always on the look out for something that will work to trim my lethal weapons down to something that only a cat would love and this came highly rated.  I can see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are SHARP.  They cut through my nails with a minimum of effort.  The side cutter crack was not hyperbole, by the way.  My nails are extremely thick and hard.  These cutters make trimming them a joy instead of potentially lethal.  Yes, there&#x27;s still the loud click when it&#x27;s cut, but at least there isn&#x27;t the grunt of effort, the straining with both hands and the perspiration that broke out in the effort in getting one nail trimmed like there was with side cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the utter lack of pain like before, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail doesn&#x27;t tend to shatter, either, like it occasionally did with ordinary trimmers.  The sharpness allows the jaws to go in gently enough to work the nail off without flinging it like a rifle bullet toward the cat.  The angle on the trimmer head is what I like, even though it may not be something others like.  My nails tend to get a bit ingrown (ya THINK?) so the angle makes it easier to get in there and trim it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jaws are separated enough to get most of my thick nails in it, and it&#x27;s sharp enough to &amp;#34;chew&amp;#34; its way in if the nail is a bit too much for one bite.  The shape is good for my large hands as well.  The quality seems high and because the jaws have an off-set bite (like how teeth come together in the front on a person with the bottom or top behind the other) instead of hitting edge to edge, the sharpness is preserved longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have toenails that frighten little kids and adults alike, if you get calls from Geneva about war crimes every time you trim them, if you want to watch the stock price of spackle drop, get these clippers.  You&#x27;ll be thrilled you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And your socks will thank you for it.k nails in it, and it&#x27;s sharp enough to &amp;#34;chew&amp;#34; its way in if the nail is a bit too much for one bite.

    <li> Yes I loved the easy action on the SEKI large clipper, Cutting heavy nails is a breeze. I let my parents use it. they&#x27;re 80 and have heavy OLD nails.... Dad has his done at the podiatrist. Mom took this cutter from me tho, she loves the ease of use and great cutting action.&lt;br /&gt;I am left with the SEKI in grown nail cutter which I find easier to use than the larger SEKI that my MOM took.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful cutter&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;10/15/12  -  my folks have the larger SEKI cutter. I was left with this, It was original just for cutting ingrown nails when the need arose. I&#x27;ve used these in-grown cutters as my only nail cutter and it does a splendid job. I think this SEKI cutter may give me better control of the cut than the larger one. I am happy with this and will not be ordering the other one.&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE THIS SEKI IN_GROWN NAIL CUTTER BETTER THAN THE SEKI NAIL CUTTER!</li>
    <li> Very strong and exactly what I was looking for. It has a tilt to it but if you hold it a certain way it cuts straight across which is what I wanted. Worth the money and it shipped out extremely fast.</li>
    <li> Nothing works better.</li>
    <li> Tried these on my ingrown toe nails and I just don&#x27;t see how they are supposed to work. No instructions either. Good as a quality clipper but thats it.</li>
    <li> Hard to say about this.    My In-grown nail might be \\&quot;a toughie\\&quot;.    The Seki is built like a tank!  This thing is not flimsy at all!  The cutting edge is just too tough to get dull :-)    The clipper sure keeps that In-Grown nail from daring to get worse, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be what I am looking for as far as digging the thing out.      -Bob</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper for its purported ability to dig out ingrown nails.  When I attempted to use it for this purpose I discovered that the width of the clipper prevents it from doing such.  I reverted to using my cheaper 2 dollar pair of clippers for clipping of nails past the edge of the toe.</li>
    <li> The Seki clipper is sharp, requiring little effort, and does seem to catch most clippings - but not all.  The head is straight, neither concave or convex, which is right for toenails.  It is, however, set at an angle, which makes it a bit difficult to get used to.  Almost seems designed to be used by a second person (like a pedicurist).</li>
    <li> Know what? You can go to Walgreens or any dollar stores and get a nail clipper with only 69 cents. Yes, it&#x27;s $0.69 as compared with $9.00. My Walgreens nail clipper satisfied my need enough. Do not waste money!</li>
    <li> The two blades are not aligned properly.  When closed, the blades are off by about 1/4 to 1 mm.  The range is because I&#x27;ve tried three of these (amazon replaced it twice).  They do &#x27;work&#x27;, but they leave the nail shredded instead of anything close to nicely cut.</li>
    <li> Very strong, you don&#x27;t have to put much effort into cutting your thick toenails. There&#x27;s a file on the other side of the handle. I love the straight edge... prevents painful ingrown toenails. There&#x27;s a hole at the end so you can put it on a keychain if you wish. The nail \\&quot;catcher\\&quot; is awesome... no longer have to keep track of where my nail bits flew.</li>
    <li> I have had these clippers for 2 months now. I did not think that an angle head would make any difference. Happily I was wrong. These clippers get the job done. The angle is jut perfect for removing my curled toenail. My feet have never felt better.</li>
    <li> Heft.  These things aren&#x27;t your mommy&#x27;s nail clippers, yet they are still extremely maneuverable.  Sharp?  Goodness, yes.  Confident that these will do the job well.</li>
    <li> Clipper cuts nicely.  Blade width is fine for fingernails but is not wide enough for toenails.  Very difficult to control overlap cuts on toenails so that the intersection of the two cuts is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the main difficulty with this clipper is that the surfaces of the Clipper are way too smooth.  It keeps slipping out of my fingers, making it almost impossible to control a cut.  The only way I have found to control this clipper is to put on a rubber glove on the hand controlling the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;Compartment&#x27; that is supposedly provided to hold the nail clippings just does not work, because it has too many openings.  There isn&#x27;t anything there to after cutting a nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying any more of these.</li>
    <li> I really like this clipper - don&#x27;t get me wrong. But that metal \\&quot;holder\\&quot; for catching clippings really doesn&#x27;t do much and actually blocks your \\&quot;view\\&quot; of the nail edge you&#x27;re trying to catch.    BEST parts? Super-sharp cutting edge, the broader lever and the EXCELLENT file!!!     The slanted blade is nice to reach into edges if you need to - but sometimes you wish it were slanted the OTHER way - so perhaps the higher-priced, more traditional toenail clipper would work better for some. That slant doesn&#x27;t show clearly in all photos - be aware, however, it&#x27;s there!! It&#x27;s not straight across or curved like most (or like Seki&#x27;s other more expensive model).    That said - I highly recommend Seki clippers; they have no competition remotely close. Sure, they cost a bit more, but they are worth it for edge quality, clipping strength and cleanness, and maintaining their cutting ability.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Hard for me to hold and clip  my nails, esp. my big toe nail. Needs to be more streamlined, too bulky and clip part not long enough. I do like the slant but doesn&#x27;t go behind nail very easy.</li>
    <li> Very useful to have on hand, especially if you&#x27;re partial to ingrown toes or hangnails.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I had no idea how much better a toenail clipper could be.  This works wonderfully.  Well, I haven&#x27;t even tried to get it to catch the clippings in it&#x27;s little container. I fight ingrown toenails all the time and this works better than anything else.  The picture doesn&#x27;t show the slant of the cutters, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  If you think it might, don&#x27;t buy it, because it could be make a big difference.</li>
    <li> Gets in those hard to reach places when you&#x27;re trimming your toenails.  Super sharp and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I was concerned about the time and money of going to a podiatrist, but thanks to these toenails it was not necessary.</li>
    <li> Impressive.  Cuts through nails like butter.  Really an upgrade over anything you can buy at your local Target or Walgreens.</li>
    <li> Clippers seem to be excellent quality, However the blades don&#x27;t align / meet up correctly, I bought these 6 months ago and tried them once. Seller was good but clippers seem like 2nds</li>
    <li> I had previously ordered the standard Seiki toenail clipper and was disappointed that it did not open wide enough to clip the nails on my big toes. This one opens just wide enough and does an excellent job with little effort. It is so nice to get a smooth solid cut without having the clippings go flying all over the room!</li>
    <li> Normally I am for bargains and low prices but sometimes you get what you pay for. I have purchased many bargain clippers in the past and they did not clip properly and eventually break. I was tired of that and so I was willing to pay more and went to a local Bed Bath and Beyond store and purchased a German made clipper. It broke the first time I used it. I returned it to the store. I came upon this clipper on Amazon and read the review and I clicked to purchase it and voila! Came to the house in 2 days! I started clipping and I was so happy to finally get a quality clipper that I remember from many years ago!! Great quality in every way, and great clipping action and also the clipper teeth has larger separation from each other for those thick toe nails!! I find it is excellent for the fingernails. And it also came with nail file on one of the handle.</li>
    <li> It took me a long time to find this clipper. Best one I ever had. I hated the ones that curved. I was always clipping my cuticles by mistake.  Buy  one  you will love it. nioe and sharp cuts clean</li>
    <li> Not able to use it, does not open wide enough for my big toe nail neither does the toe nail clipper !! Would like to be able to send both back .</li>
    <li> I know some reviewers are confused by the straight edge instead of the more familiar concave blade.  BUT, if you have toenails that are curved, this just works better.  This is the first I&#x27;ve used with the angled blade instead of straight across but it works well when leaning over trying to clip your toenails.    It is sharp and strong ... works without a lot of work squeezing the lever.    The nail file isn&#x27;t all that great but I don&#x27;t use it anyway ... use and external file.    It works fine as a fingernail clipper too.</li>
    <li> These in-grown toe nail clippers are excellent.  I have in-grown nails on both big toes and they drive me nuts.  I&#x27;ve been using nail clippers for years to clip the in-grown nails.  Received these clippers only two days ago and I can&#x27;t believe the difference.  So easy to use and best of all this little clipper has a mini deposit to hold the clippings.  Now I&#x27;m not picking the nails up from the floor as they flew across the room.  Get em you won&#x27;t be sorry.  Good gift for the elderly folks - they all have in-grown toe nails.</li>
    <li> Affordable &amp; High quality</li>
    <li> works well for the intended purpose.</li>
    <li> I wanted this clipper because I had suffered from ingrown toe nails on both of my big toes for over 7 years. I had gone to doctors and they always did that little surgery where they take out half of my nail out. But the nail would always grow back and get the side of my toe infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use Tea Tree Oil and apply it to the infected area where the nail is ingrown, it will seriously do wonders. This was what cured my ingrown toe nail for good. I haven&#x27;t suffered from ingrown toe nail on either of my toes for over 3 years now!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews.  Slanted cutting edge?  Not a problem for a right-hander.  I usually cut my toenails after a shower, so they are softer.  Since my old toenail clippers vanished, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try these out once they arrived.  I trimmed my toenails dry; something I didn&#x27;t think was possible without splintering the nail.  One thing to note: the reservoir for clippings is open at both ends.  The clipper will house your clippings, but keep the clipper level and be prepared to empty between each nail.</li>
    <li> Does not chip and tear nail like other trimmers I have used.  I Would recommend these to anyone with in-grown toenails.</li>
    <li> These are very well made clippers, and are extremely sharp.  I also like the fact that they have a \\&quot;clipping catcher\\&quot; built into the handle which works nicely.  I like these clippers, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase them if you&#x27;re on the fence about this item.</li>
    <li> I have used made in china based inferior quality nail cutter. This is a better quality.</li>
    <li> cuts better than local purchase devices, sharper and more leverage makes cutting better! would prefer cheaper but Dollar Store that doesn&#x27;t work really isn&#x27;t that better a deal.</li>
    <li> good for gift to my sister</li>
    <li> Love these high quality clippers worth the money. they really get the side of your toenail great! I recommend these if your prone to ingrown toenails.l</li>
    <li> As a massage therapist who needs to groom my nail often, I have to say these are among the very best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT TOP QUALITY ITEM</li>
    <li> I had to start trimming my elderly mother&#x27;s wicked thick and curved toenails this past year.  There was NOTHING I had in my arsenal that would even come CLOSE to getting a good cut - I needed help!  I found these and thought I&#x27;d try them and WOW!  I am a believer!  Now I don&#x27;t have to dread this task - it&#x27;s amazing what you can do with the right tools!</li>
    <li> Very nice. Better than any toe nail clippers I have owned and worth the extra money! I honestly do not understand the one star reviews. This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These high quality stainless steel clippers are made in Japan. They make trimming tough toe nails a breeze. You&#x27;ll never want to use those clippers you got at the drugstore for $4.00 again. These clippers are like the Rolls Royce is to the Pinto. Well worth the price. The company makes other high-quality implements (check out their web site).</li>
    <li> This is the best Toenail Clipper ever I used , it makes our life easy and we love it..</li>
    <li> I wanted a clipper with a straight edge and the edge on these is perfectly straight instead of slightly curved.</li>
    <li> this was a gift to someone so they could clip there just in case in-grown toe nails so far its doing the job as advertised yea!!!</li>
    <li> I prefer to keep both my finger &amp; toe nails short (to the point where it&#x27;s extremely difficult to attach &amp; detach keys on a ring). It&#x27;s difficult for me to clip my toe nails even after growing them longer than I prefer. Previous Amazon reviews suggested this clipper may be used to also clip finger nails. For me this suggestion is utterly false. However, I found that the file works extremely well for my needs. I use the file 1-2 times per week to keep both my finger &amp; toe nails short and groomed. I found doing this works easier for my needs.</li>
    <li> Fantastic clipper.  Outshines them all.</li>
    <li> These are awesome toenail clippers! Really good quality stuff. I use these after my ingrown toenail surgery to keep it from reoccuring. I was so impressed with the quality I have since ordered other Seki clippers.</li>
    <li> this clipper is pretty darn good.  it catches small clippings and temporarily contains them.  if you want curved nails you just have to make more clips (unless you want concave nail curve, then forget about this tool).  snaps through tough toenails with little effort.  the file surface on the back of the lever is much more user friendly (to me) than the flip out file on most other makes.</li>
    <li> This is the best brand of clipper, period!  Ultra sharp and little effort needed to clip.  Only thing is that I have both the finger and toe clippers and I would tell you to get the finger clippers only.  They can do the job of both.</li>
    <li> Cut thick toenails with ease!</li>
    <li> Sharp and easy to operate. It is difficult to find a straight edge clipper which was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Marginal.  It&#x27;s not easy to use, mostly because it&#x27;s so bulky, due to the part that&#x27;s supposed to catch the clippings.  I give it a 6-7 at best and I could definitely do without it.  Sorry!</li>
    <li> After years of fighting dime store clippers, I finally bought my wife some real ones. Holy Cow! the difference is amazing and well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Works great. Nice sharp edge and easy to cut the edge of your toenails.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and sharp enough to cut thick nails especially if the nail is ingrown. Great for finger nails and toe nails.</li>
    <li> I love these! Great quality, good price and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these for a while, and they&#x27;ve never failed to disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Will not go back to drugstore clipper again.</li>
    <li> Seki Toenail clippers are of the highest, sturdy quality and due to the weight and superior functional design,&lt;br /&gt;they are extremely comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> worked well on my slightly ingrown toenail which was giving me fits.  I feel better.  It is easy to use and I use it on the rest of my toenails too so it isn&#x27;t just a one use item</li>
    <li> Large enough to hold onto and strong enough to cut toenails. High quality toe nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this item to my friends</li>
    <li> i want you to know that I never have even opened this clipper. It was ordered by accident. I have WINDOWS 7 PROFESSIONAL and deleted this product. I went back to shop for other things and AMAZON PUT THE DELETED ITEM BACK ON MY ORDER. I INTEND TO RETURN IT. The most important thing I want you to know is that I own 18 CLIPIT BRAND KNIVES AND AN ENTIRE SEKI KITCHEN KNIFE SET. I ALSO OWN 4 NAIL CLIPPERS MADE BY SEKI. i USED TO USE HENKEL KITCHEN KNIVES BUT FOR THE PRICE OF 2 HENKELS I CAN PURCHASE AN ENTIRE SEKI KITCHEN SET WHICH I BELIEVE IS AT LEAST AS GOOD AS ANY HENKEL HUNTING OR KITCHEN KNIFE I HAVE OWNED!</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase. Will b lookin for more SEKI PRODUCTS to buy soon. These may help reduce the # of pedicures i pay for every month.</li>
    <li> Finally a great pair of clippers that don&#x27;t chew my nails off or leave barbs.  Very comfortable to operate.  A quality product.  I bought both toe and finger models.</li>
    <li> A++++++. Super fast shipping and a great deal!  Thank you!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am using these but have a hard time clipping my toenails with them.  Will probably replace them with an easier pair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product[[ASIN:B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper]][[ASIN:B000REOEYM Seki Edge In-Grown Toenail Clipper]]    Excellent product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got substance and is not flimsy.  It makes short work of even the most alarming toenail situations.  The little \\&quot;compartment\\&quot; for clippings is nifty.  It&#x27;s a solid product.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers. They are sharp and they plow through my husband&#x27;s thick nails.  I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> My drugstore toenail clippers never worked well....and the last time I tried them on my big toenails, they barely bent the nails before giving up. I thought I was going to end up with Hobbit toes -- but then these Seki clippers arrived and they cut the nails like buttah. While these are called in-grown toenail clippers, they seem to be standard straight clippers (with an angle that makes the whole process a little easier.) The clippings holder doesn&#x27;t work, but that&#x27;s not a priority. They are sharp, obviously, so be careful as you clip away.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers, get the job done!</li>
    <li> Well made, sturdy, sharp cutting surface.  Does the trick better than most before.  Should last forever the way it is built.</li>
    <li> And very well made, unlike the ones I&#x27;ve been using my whole life. I&#x27;m sure these will last for many years.</li>
    <li> I like these much better than traditional clips.</li>
    <li> Great toenail clippers.  Very sturdy and should last forever.</li>
    <li> Sharp and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Delivery and packing were fine.  The clipper is as described, but I don&#x27;t find it as useful as my regular clippers.  The &amp;#34;nipper&amp;#34; type would be more useful in my case.</li>
    <li> Nice grip and cut my toenails as they were butter.</li>
    <li> This one is great for straight cuts and, like the rest of the Seki Edge line, very well made.</li>
    <li> If you have lived your life on drug store clippers, run, don&#x27;t walk to get these. A minor revaluation!</li>
    <li> I did not like these clippers, they were very hard to clip with.  I ended up really doing a number on my nails and I was unable to get the ingrown that led me to buy these.</li>
    <li> This product has an excellently sharpened front end, it&#x27;s comfortable in one&#x27;s hand, and best of all, it contains the clippings to make clean up a breeze.</li>
    <li> I never realized that my clippers where just crushing my nails and not really cutting them. As I&#x27;ve gotten older my nails have gotten thicker and I wanted something that worked better. These worked GREAT!</li>
    <li> Although these are high quality and work well on most toenails I was surprised when I tried to use these on big toes and find the clipper opening is narrower than I expected and I can&#x27;t use them. Will keep for general use but will have to look around for another clipper that has a wider opening.</li>
    <li> These things are SHARP! Had no problem doing the job they were designed to do. If you&#x27;re looking for some clippers that&#x27;ll cut through the toughest nails, you&#x27;ve found them!</li>
    <li> As described.  Would buy again.  Very sharp and well made.</li>
    <li> Excellent item. The size of the clipper makes easy to cut the nails straight. Good quality</li>
    <li> I bought finger and toe nail clippers from Seki. Although they are more expensive than most clippers, they are worth the price! It is definitely worth it to spend a little more for a great product that will last years and years longer than a cheap $3-4 set of clippers.</li>
    <li> This clipper is very sharp and cut your nail clean. It is well made given it was made in Japan. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t do the job quite well. Let me explain...As you can see the edge is slanted and this is good cause you can cut the sides of your nail really good BUT not the other side. It is difficult to do the other side of your nail since the slanted edge is just on one side. I hope my review could help could help someone decide with their purchase.</li>
    <li> They broke on me the second time I used them. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these clippers as they are an absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> Nice clipper, it works.  But like most clippers, bathroom humidity makes them develot rust.</li>
    <li> High quality, sharp, smooth operation.  Well worth the extra dough.  Only wish they made the convex blades for true ingrown relief/prevention.</li>
    <li> Works good really not that impressed with it some people might like it is a good product quality made</li>
    <li> I like the straight cut, and the angle of the clipper.  But frankly, the $3 toenail clipper from the drug store is sharper and clips more cleanly.</li>
    <li> I love my Seki fingernail clippers. They do a phenomenal job. As pleased as I was with them, I ordered the toenail clippers. Sadly, these are not the toenail clippers for me. I am not sure who these are designed for, actually. My nails grow close to the toe--don&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s?--and the rolled under blades don&#x27;t get under the nails. As these are specifically labeled as \\&quot;In-Grown\\&quot; clippers, it makes the design even more perplexing. I have in-grown toenails and I can tell you, these can&#x27;t get down in there to trim. I&#x27;ll continue to practice with them--since there does not seem to be an obvious alternative, but I am not hopeful.</li>
    <li> I have thick toenails. The clipper opening looks like it&#x27;s designed for fingernails. I&#x27;m keeping them since my wife has \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toenails.</li>
    <li> These cut amazingly well. There is really no comparison between this and the standard toenail clippers you can get at the drug store. They are sharp and effortless to use.</li>
    <li> The ergonomic slant edge is very useful. Blades are very sharp. It&#x27;s excellent and I recommend it highly even for non problematic toenails</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a piece of crap. no file  and handle WILL NOT STAY IN THE FOLDED POSITION WHEN CARRYING IN ONES POCKET</li>
    <li> The reviews went on and on about what a wonderful product this was.  It was OK.  Nothing special about it.  It didn&#x27;t cut through thick nails like the reviewers were claiming, at least not mine.</li>
    <li> These are very good clippers for the money and are quite sharp. I&#x27;m glad to have discovered this barand and will be buying more of their product line in the future.</li>
    <li> Nice size clipper for toenails.  Cleanly snips off toenails without exacerbating or causing ingrown nails.  Easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> I have in-grown toenails and every time that I went to cut them it was an adventure in dodging flying nail pieces, and hoping that none of them fly into my eyes.  A friend told me about this particular clipper, and while the price is more than what I&#x27;ve ever paid for a clipper, I figured it couldn&#x27;t be worse than what I currently had.  I really wish I had bought these years ago.  I was able to cut my toenails in less than five minutes, and with the built in nail catcher, it was a snap to get rid of the clippings.  The clipper cuts cleanly and easily, and it&#x27;s the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  It also has a little file built into the lever which was nice after I finished cutting my nails.  For anyone that has had any issues in cutting your own toenails, this clipper is for you.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> It broke and fell apart on me. Bad weld on the end. I put a screw in place and it seems to work alright now.</li>
    <li> I have mild &amp;#34;pincer nails&amp;#34; on my feet, that naturally grow inward from the sides. It&#x27;s been a painful and somewhat difficult thing to manage for many years (especially when I was in the Army and walked everywhere), typically involving a metal nail file used to pry the nail out of the skin and taking a small set of clippers to get the sharp edge off. These clippers have an angle that is very helpful, since the exercise involves sitting down, getting my foot near my hands, and making sure to get leverage to work the clippers while having enough control to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative is their size - they seem to work very well on my big toenail, but they aren&#x27;t quite as good for the pincer nails on my smaller toes. However, the angle is great for trimming the front of all of my toes, and the times I have let my toenails get long enough to start to truly become ingrown, they are very effective at taking care of that.</li>
    <li> Very strong and large</li>
    <li> This clipper disappointed me. It doesn&#x27;t live up to the reviews that I read. In addition, it has a strange angle that I found uncomfortable. Bottom line - a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Slimmer than normal clippers, but it does a great job, and has good quality metal.  Also, the nail catch is pretty good, not 10% but pretty good.</li>
    <li> After having tried many toenail clippers that have not worked well, I was pleased to find this one.  It works great for two reasons.  It can readily get under an ingrown toenail, and it has sharp cutters that readily remove the ingrown part of the toenail.  It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I got this to use when i had a bad pedicure and my toenail got ripped back way to far and to have a general better pair of toenail clipper.  They are sturdier and heavier than any pair I have had before.  Super sharp and do the job.  Getting used to the straight edge but not finding it to be a problem, just different.  I haven&#x27;t really paid attention to whether it  catches the clippings as I cut my nails over a waste basket anyways.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> If you go to a drug store the average toe nail clipper runs about $3.  Rounded off this one is $10.  For $10 this toe nail clipper should light my cigarette while I&#x27;m toe jammin&#x27;.  I guess the novelty is the compartment that captures the diced toe nails.  Big fricken&#x27; deal!  The only thing that saved this transaction for me is that I ordered something else and got free shippin&#x27;.  Buy the $3 one.</li>
    <li> I have one toe with an ingrown nail.  It can be excruciating to clip this nail, but with the Seki Edge In-Grown Toenail Clipper there is little or no pain.  Clip without fear!</li>
    <li> Good idea, but a bit too gimmicky. The clipper cuts just fine if you can just get in close enough. The cutting edges are too short, needs to be elongated a bit more or remove the &amp;#34;clippings catcher&amp;#34;. The clippings catcher catches some clippings, but not enough to justify having the sides there getting in the way. Good idea that needs a bit mor ergonomic refining.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have ingrown toenails, but I&#x27;ve always struggled to cut my curved big toes&#x27; nails.  It was hard to fit my traditional toenail clipper onto my nails either because of the nails&#x27; curvature or bec the gap on the clipper was not wide enough.  The curved clipper also left slight dents in the middle when I tried to cut the toenails squared.  This Seki Edge Clipper&#x27;s straight and sharp edge does the trick beautifully and effortlessly.  Another great discovery on Amazon that improved a small but necessary routine.  Nice quality.  Keep out of reach from young children.</li>
    <li> Works great. 4 stars because it is slightly difficult to get into &#x27;corners,&#x27; but it&#x27;s extremely sharp! cuts very cleanly!</li>
    <li> I have thick toenails and this does a great job. No more words need to be entered in this space.</li>
    <li> After years of having our nails chewed off by inferior clippers, it&#x27;s a pleasure to be able to snip them cleanly!</li>
    <li> These clippers are nice, and very sharp!  Be careful my husband cut himself while using.  They are easy to use, unlike other clippers you have to squeeze so tightly.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best toenail clipper I have used.  With this tool, I shouldn&#x27;t need the regular toenail clipper.  This slanted edge is  perfect for the right handed person.  The angle allows me to clip my toenail in comfortable position.</li>
    <li> does not show the slanted cutting edge. Hard to use...thought i was getting a straight edge, quality TOE NAIL clipper...waste of money for me...</li>
    <li> It does cut more smoothly than most clippers. It&#x27;s a little easier to manage in your hand.  The straight cutting edge feature works out better for me.  The clipping-catching feature works, but not as well as I would like.  The cutting slot does not open wide enough to accommodate the heaviest of my fungus-infected nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d probably buy it again, but I&#x27;m still looking for a better tool.  (Better yet, a real cure!)</li>
    <li> While it appears to be very well made, the cutting end is just too big and bulky to reach and ingrown toenail.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this clipper reading good reviews and the detailed explanation of the product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This so called Japanese made precision steel clipper is a load of crap.&lt;br /&gt;I would give 0 star if that was an option.&lt;br /&gt;It chips nails when i cut them!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got healthy nails. I rarely paint them or do any unnatural things.&lt;br /&gt;Only  low quality cheap dull clippers would chip my nails when i use them.&lt;br /&gt;This clipper chips my nails in every single clip!  Hand or toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t think this is made of steel.&lt;br /&gt;Usually products made with good materials boast and write, emboss the materials on the products.&lt;br /&gt;I inspected the clipper closely and there was no mention of steel anywhere on it.&lt;br /&gt;You just have to take the word from the elaborate explanation on the product page.&lt;br /&gt;I am no metal expert, But i think it&#x27;s made of cheap chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just go to a drug store and get Trimm. Much better quality at much less cost.&lt;br /&gt;Or if you want to splurge, try Twizerman at Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;Just about any clippers are better than this so called precision steel product made in Japan.</li>
    <li> well what can I say they work correctly and I would buy this brand again if I need to they feel really well made and I think it will last a good long time</li>
    <li> This is a super sharp implement.  I like the design that catches the clippings; simple and effective.  I think it is worth the extra expense.</li>
    <li> Received it is a couple days.  Didn&#x27;t realize the cutting edge was at an angle.  Already knew it was a straight cut and takes a little getting use to using the angle cut.  Very sharp!</li>
    <li> These do a good job on clipping my thick toenails, I mostly bought these because I was getting ingrown toenails...</li>
    <li> This product works very well and does what it claims to do i.e. cuts toenails better than lesser brands.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hard to find straight cut nail nippers. Well made and sharp. I have searched local pharmacies and cannot find this design - all are curved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with ingrown toe nails on my large toes. I only share this to help others. Cut those nails straight across leaving the nail a little longer and then cut a \\&quot; v \\&quot; in the center of the toenail about 1/8 inch wide and deep. Since I began cutting my nails this way, I have only had one ingrown nail in twenty years. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I had been having problems with nail clippers, never finding the right ones that would do a good job clipping my nails cleanly and evenly, not leaving spurs, could clip fingernails and toenails, could handle the corners on ingrown nails or problem areas, could handle small clean-up spots without making matters worse, and so forth. I also had trouble finding clippers that would work in my hands with some very bad nerve tremors. I had bought individual clippers, sets of grooming tools, specialty clippers and items, and all sorts of things, all to no avail. I took a chance when I saw these Seki Edge clippers, and I could tell immediately I did not go wrong. First, they are very sharp, high-quality clippers - and sharpness makes a huge difference! They are aligned well, which eliminates the spurs and uneven spots. The basic fingernail and toenail clippers have specially formed ends and holding grooves on both the top and bottom ends to make them much easier to hold when your arm is extended, even with hand tremors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now. I let my wife try them out, and she loved them. I watched over her as she used them, took them back from her immediately, hid them from her, and am buying a set of them for her for her birthday at the end of this month. All the clippers purchased are excellent products I would highly recommend to anyone who wants great clippers at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> A useful implement that largely does the job it sets out to do.  It cuts well and cleanly and easily.  Nevertheless a highly embedded in-growing toe nail will still pose a difficult challenge even for this implement</li>
    <li> These are sharp and help cut the corners of ingrown nails.  I&#x27;m not positive I&#x27;m using them correctly, however.  The package implies previous knowledge.  I still feel I may end up at a podiatrists office.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t pay attention to details, and frequently mis-cut my nails using drugstore brand clippers.  This leaves me with hangnails, choppy nails etc.  I now use these clippers for all my nails, and they do an incredible job.  They are called in-grown toenail clippers, but these are great for standard use.</li>
    <li> perfect but why they are  going to send it so late , the parchase in january but the promied date in march ? but any way  seki rdge product is ok.</li>
    <li> This clipper has a flat head at an angle.  Most conventional clippers have circular cutting surface and approach the cut directly in front of the clipper.  The angle allows this clipper to be held straight while still accessing the side of the toe at an angle.  It also has a flat cutting surface that allows the entire cutting surface access to the area to be cut.</li>
    <li> terrific for slightly cutting the edges of toenails. i repeat slight edges, since its bad to deeply cut the toenails edges, unless in the case of advance in grown.</li>
    <li> Sharp and efficient.  Work great.  Very happy with these after trying various ones found in the store.  Would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I bought it  because it has the nail file and catcher.But it just doesn&#x27;t work at all.The build-in catcher does not catch,and the files can&#x27;t hold ,the nails it catches will come out from the bottom.You can see from the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one  Seki Edge Ss-109 Satin Slim Clipper, Stainless Steel,same thing!!&lt;br /&gt;And It&#x27;s not eligible for return.So I waste my $28&lt;br /&gt;I never wrote any bad reviews,but now I just feel I have to .</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t buy decent clippers locally anymore. These are sharp and they hold together. Angled head makes it easy to reach left toes with right hand.</li>
    <li> Not much better the the drug store</li>
    <li> These things are very very high quality..&lt;br /&gt;They make a great gift for anyone (i mean, who doesnt clip their nails?).&lt;br /&gt;They are smooth, sharp, easy to use, very long lasting, durable, and like i said- high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think the price is a good deal for the product.&lt;br /&gt;5*****s</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the clippers you find in drugstores are cheap junk.  This clipper comes from Jatai, a company that produces quality brands like Feather.  These clippers work the way they are supposed to and the price I found on Amazon was very good.  I would have preferred to buy American, but it seems that all the domestic brands are made in China with little or no quality control.</li>
    <li> I can really feel the quality every time I use them. They clip the nail without any real effort required.</li>
    <li> Works great--just need to find a good &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; to hold this and other products to keep in my purse with me.</li>
    <li> I do like these.  They work great.  With the angled edge you can see what you are cutting!  At first I thought they weren&#x27;t cutting as they do not make that characteristic clipping sound. They are sharp!</li>
    <li> THESE REALLY WORK GREA  THEY ARE TRULY COMFORTABLE  AND EASY TO USE ON THE MOST  STUBBORN NAILS.  THEY ARE TRULY WORTH YHE HIGHER COST</li>
    <li> Works great for ingrown toe nails</li>
    <li> I was searching for a toe nail clipper that would cut straight across my nail.  This certainly isn&#x27;t the least expensive, but it is well-built and does the job.</li>
