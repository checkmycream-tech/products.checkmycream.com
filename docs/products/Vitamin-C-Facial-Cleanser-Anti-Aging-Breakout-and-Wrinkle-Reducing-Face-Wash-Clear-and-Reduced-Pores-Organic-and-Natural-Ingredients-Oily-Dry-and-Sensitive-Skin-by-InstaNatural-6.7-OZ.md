<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am pleased with everything this cleanser has to offer! It smells citrusy and fresh, has the perfect gel consistency, and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to get a great lather going.  My skin felt so refreshed and rejuvenated, without feeling stripped and tight.  I have combination skin, and this cleanser was the perfect balance for my skin needs.  I am so excited to have found one more InstaNatural product that I love!  I always like to have products from the same line, when I can.  I feel like they work together and help my skin look  the best it possibly can.</li>
    <li> This is a great no-fragrance, clear, simple, gentle and effective cleanser.  A tiny half-pump covers a lot of skin and it really feels like it&#x27;s deeply cleansing without overdrying or any harsh chemicals.  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems using this - my skin feels cleaner and clearer than it has in a while.</li>
    <li> I really like Insta Natural products. I feel like it really gets the make-up and dirt of the day out of the skin. I love that you don&#x27;t even have to use a full pump for it to do a thorough job of cleaning your whole face. I will say if your skin is on the drier side this could dry your skin out a bit, but if you use a good moisturizer  anyway you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. It has a different smell which I could see where it would bother some people, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. *I received this in exchange of my honest opinion/review.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. Definitely gets my face super squeeqy clean without drying my skin out.</li>
    <li> After using this product, I don&#x27;t really feel amazed with it. To me it is just like any other gel cleanser; there is no wow factor with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Love this brand and love their customer service. 10 stars!!!</li>
    <li> This is great for anyone with sensitive, dry skin. I have been using this for a little over a week and havent had any issues yet. Anything I buy from walmart or cvs irritates me after just one use, so I&#x27;m sure this will be something I can use for a while.</li>
    <li> Love this product . Makes my face feel amazing.</li>
    <li> I love that this is specifically a vitamin C cleanser, I know we all need a little more vitamin C in our lives. I&#x27;m constantly looking for new cleansers because my face breaks out and is oily and I really like this cleanser. It seems to be working really well and my skin seems brighter and definitely looks healthier, I really think it&#x27;s because of the vitamin C. Plus anything made in the USA catches my eye!</li>
    <li> This cleanser definitely lived up to all of my expectations and exceeded them. Right away, I could feel that it was pretty potent and would be powerful in doing what it promised.I would certainly recommend this cleanser!I  The promotional pricing I received for testing and review.</li>
    <li> I have been using a lot of different InstaNatural products lately and was really excited to try this cleanser. I really like that it comes with a pump so it&#x27;s easy to dispense into my hands or on a facial sponge. I was a bit disappointed that it didn&#x27;t smell like citrus like a lot of InstaNatural Vitamin C products. I do like the natural and organic ingredients in this cleanser though. It contains 10% vitamin C, organic licorice, pomegranate, rosehip oil, and organic aloe vera.  Now I do recommend you do NOT get this cleanser in your eyes. It definitely should not be used to remove your eye makeup as it does burn. It does a great job of washing face makeup off though. This vitamin C cleanser leaves my face looking and feeling clean. It helps with sun spots, fine lines, and wrinkles. It also moisturizes your face which is great for my dry skin. So far I really like this cleanser! *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> this is a perfect cleanser for me! cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry my face, i never loved the color of my face but now it&#x27;s perfect! i also bought insta natural eye cream, which i use also on my face. i swear! after one use my skin looked so much younger! i&#x27;ll never use anything except instanatural&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> This cleans your face well, but it gets very foamy and I&#x27;m just not a fan of foaming face wash, but I have a friend who LOVES this face wash!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser has been great.  My skin tone has definitely evened out and looks healthier since using this wash.  I also have noticed if I forget moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t matter, it also moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser! Makes my skin fresh clean and clear. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the Vitamin C Facial Cleanser!  It cleans your face and leaves it feeling soft and fresh!  Is not strong smelling as some cleansers can be.  I highly recommend anyone to try this product!</li>
    <li> great  product,  I been using this product  every day  I was even  this product  too  try out and too give  my  opinion  as too what I like about this product.  no smell,  and  feels nice on my face</li>
    <li> I am love with this vitamin c cleasner, I follow the directions, it went on my skin easy, there was no irritation,it made my skin very soft,smooth I was so amazed afterwards how my skin felt,love the natural ingredients, my skin loves it.I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
    <li> This may possibly be my favorite cleanser of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different cleansers, most recently my favorite (Possibly a holy grail) has been Purity by Philosophy. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these two are nothing alike and even the claims for each of these are different. I just love how Purity really takes off all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling squeeky clean. However, I may even argue that it makes my skin feel too clean which also leads to it being dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;With the Vitamin C Cleanser, that isn&#x27;t the case. I&#x27;ve used this both morning and night because I really wanted to form a solid opinion on this even though I knew it was love at first use. This cleanser really helps take all of my makeup off. I always recommend using a cleanser designed for that purpose first, but if you&#x27;re a one cleanser type of person.. This will do the trick. Keep in mind, I wear nearly a full face of makeup with very full coverage, and one wash with this removes it all. Not only does it remove all of my makeup, but I truly do feel like it leaves my face feeling brand new. To me, that means it hasn&#x27;t stripped all the oils out of my skin which is an amazing thing! It also does leave my skin with a nice glowey look. I always enjoy that because it makes me feel so naturally beautiful. The glow (for me at least) doesn&#x27;t last all day but at least I know how clean my skin is. There&#x27;s two down sides to this product for me. However, neither of these will ever prevent me from repurchasing. First of all, this doesn&#x27;t have the orange scent like the others in the line do.. Yeah, that&#x27;s not a big deal at all. It was always just a perk to the other Vitamin C products because, Wow.. They sure did nail that scent. So, if you hate oranges then this will workout for you, even though it has some weird scent to it.. I don&#x27;t find it to be offensive.. Just, different? Secondly, this stuff STINGS when it gets in your eyes. I never really took the &#x27;Keep Away from Eyes&#x27; label seriously on anything before. But trust me, I would HIGHLY recommend removing your eye makeup with something else before using this. Being the airhead I am, I still get some of this in my eye from time to time and a quick rinse with water does the trick. But if you can avoid it in that area completely, I would. Overall, I really love this cleanser and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;l be switching to anything else any time soon. The bottle has a pump which is awesome and you get a ton of product here. A little really does go a long way, which is saying a lot coming from me since I tend to use way too much of everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedbackly on anything before.

    <li> This is a great cleanser for combination to dry skin.  It is moisturizing and works up a nice lather.  I love that InstaNatural uses natural and organic ingredients.  It comes with an easy to use pump and a little bit goes a long way.  Leaves my skin soft, moisturized and clean.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provide for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> This is the first face cleanser that has a smell of soap and burns eyes. Not sure if I satisfied with the product. Gives a feeling of harmful ingredients and foams too much for a natural cleanser</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very thick and lathers well. It will definitely last a while. You don&#x27;t need much in a single use. It is not scented so it does have chemical smell. But not harsh or overwhelming. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I want to give it time to see it gives the results it advertised. Other than waiting to see the outcome of using it, I think this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of getting all my makeup off and it makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different face cleansers, and I must say that The InstaNatural Vitamin C Cleanser is one of my favorites so far, and let me tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;1. I love that this product has natural and organic ingredients.  My skin is so sensitive, and often times it starts to react to the many different harsh ingredients that are hidden.  The InstaNatural Vitamin C Cleanser is gentle and I do not break out from using this product at all!&lt;br /&gt;2.  The InstaNatural Vitamin C Cleanser has brightened my face, cleared my skin from acne, as well as gave me an even skin tone.  This is something that I have been longing for because of the constant sun exposure, breakouts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;3.  This product removes my makeup very well!  Just don&#x27;t get it around your eyes, or it will sting.&lt;br /&gt;4. A little bit goes a long way!  I even use 1/2 pump for my entire face.  I love that it lathers gently and washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;5. This cleanser does not dry my face, but it leaves it soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I wish I can change about this product is the scent.  I am not a big fan of the scent at all, and would love for InstaNatural to add something natural (maybe a lavender scent?) to the face wash.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this cleanser. I have a hard time giving him face washes because they dry out his beard but this one works great. He loves the smell and how it makes his skin feel.</li>
    <li> Stop trying every single new cleanser from the drugstore and start using this! I bought this cleanser to help with my dry/oily combination skin. A little goes a long way. It helps dry my t-zone without overdrying. I am going to get the toner, because I personally think it will do even better with a toner to get excess gunk out of my pores. I like how the cleanser bubbles up and lathers well. Highly recommended to those with adult acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C cleanser not only cleans my face great it makes my face look beautiful. It comes in a nice size pump bottle so you can just use one pump for your face. It doesn&#x27;t foam up which I don&#x27;t really like but I am getting used to it.  The ingredients in this cleanser will help anyone&#x27;s skin. I have combination skin and it is doing wonders helping me balance it. Plus I love the fresh clean feeling I am left with after I use it. I will continue to use it. I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I use it twice a day and leaves my skin clean, refreshed and smooth! One pump is all you need to cover your entire face and neck! It does not irritate my skin, it washes clean off my face, nondrying and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue behind. It has a pleasant smell which is nice. My skin is brighter and clearer. My family, friends and coworkers all notice the difference and I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup, which is a plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;This product is reasonably priced and will worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love the vitamin C serums I have used before so I was excited to try it.After only using it a few times I am already noticing a difference.  My skin feels smoother and I am loving the differences I am seeing.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m running out of good things to say about InstaNatural Products.  My daugher and I use this cleanser. Hydrates my face. my skin feels smoother</li>
    <li> Awesome, works really well! Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of any face wash because I only used dial soap which I know I know....not.good for my skin.  I got this and it felt great! Natural ingredients, thick and foaming, and my face felt really really clean. I just might be a regular customer now.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product ... makes my skin clean, fresh and supple. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this facial cleanser because it works wonder. It clears out all the impurities and tighten my pores but overall it works great with my skin tone. Usually I would break out on my face if I use a new cleanser but with this one my skin was totally normal.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser. It take out the dirt but does not dry out my skin. It left my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I love this facial Cleanser! i was able to purchase at a low price to review it and I was not sure that I would like it. Well this cleanser makes my face feel so clean and I really like it! i use this then a moisturizer and it is really awesome!</li>
    <li> Big bottle with a pump. I love all their skin care products. Smells light and natural. Makes my dry skin a lot better after a few day uses. It seems it will last forever. I used to switch facial cleanser very often, but now I am loving it. Will highly recommend it to friends. Great product at amazing price.</li>
    <li> Item was packed very well for shipping, but as you can see in the picture the liquid leaked. I used this cleanser for the last 2 days and haven’t really noticed any difference in softness on my skin. However, my face did feel tight and clean after using. I do have sensitive/fair skin and break out easily and this cleanser has not caused any breakouts. I do not care for the smell too much. I really dislike that if you accidentally get this cleaner in your eye it will sting. I’ve used many natural facial cleaners and never had an issue with my eyes burning after washing my face. This could be a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love testing out good products&lt;br /&gt;https://producttester911.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/instanatural-vitamin-c-cleaner/</li>
    <li> I am in my late 30s and was looking for something with Vitamin C that would help my skin be the best it can be.  I love this face wash! It delviers vitamins and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time!</li>
    <li> Yay, my new favorite cleanser! I&#x27;ve been using an all natural cleanser and it was &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;.  Until I started using this, I didn&#x27;t realize how irritated my skin was.  This is so calming and cleansing for my skin, along with the ingredients, I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll ever go to another cleanser.  The bottle is a very large size, the pump is perfect - one pump is sufficient for me.  It&#x27;s crazy how just a cleanser can make my skin feel so soft immediately after rinsing, there is ZERO dryness, ZERO oiliness/greasiness, just soft soft skin! I don&#x27;t notice a scent, it may be due to holding my breath when I wash? My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight, in fact my skin is actually calm after using  - not angry red as with other cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this, absolutely! It&#x27;s so gentle and non-irritating I am thinking my pre-teen could greatly benefit from this.</li>
    <li> This cleanser leaves my skin feeling fresh and really clean. As for the other reviewers remarking on an unpleasant smell, I have to disagree. I feel like there is NO added fragrance at all, as what you are smelling are the ingredients themselves with nothing extra added. It smells clean to me. This cleanser is not drying and my skin feels really soft after using it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The cleanse makes my skin feel smooth, clean, and feels soft. I have used different face-washes and cleansers but this is the only product that does not make my skin dry. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for about a few weeks (I forget when I got it), and it&#x27;s good stuff! I&#x27;ve been on the Vitamin C serum bandwagon since last year and figured I would add this cleanser to my anti aging and clarifying arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;I love this cleanser for washing away long wearing makeup from my skin! Since it contains various essential oils, it breaks down the makeup and removes it better than any of my oil free facial cleansers. I pump in into my hand and apply it to my face and massage it i to my skin without water (as directed), then add water, finish washing and rinse...stubnorn makeup is gone and my skin feels soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> I love ALL the InstaNatural products and have found immediate results. I am in the process of transitioning all my facial products to InstaNatural. Great results without the outrageous price to break the bank. I highly recommend these products for youthful plump skin.</li>
    <li> I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews. I&#x27;m 36 have always battled severe acne and discoloration. It&#x27;s generally horrible. I started with just the serum, then added the cleanser, then the night cream, then the toner and then the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this combination of products has drastically improved the look feel and overall health of my skin. The cleanser specifically is very gentle on my skin and I feel it does a great job removing dirt and oil and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after I finish washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis.  I&#x27;ve never felt better about my own face and it&#x27;s because I decided to invest in a line of quality products that actually works for me. I have tried several other product lines on both the mainstream cosmetic side and the natural side resulting in poor or nightmarish results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s something about this line that just works for me and&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so thankful.  I may sound a little dramatic here but for me it&#x27;s a big deal. Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  I recommend this line to anyone with combination and sensitive skin. It all takes a little getting used to but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> I wonder why I couldn&#x27;t find this product years ago.  My face is supple like baby&#x27;s face.  Everything I use breaks my skin but this is the one and only products that didn&#x27;t.  You just won a loyal and forever customer.  Lol</li>
    <li> This is a great facial cleanser. It is a little stronger than what I had been using before but I do feel like my face has been super clean since I started using it!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is a clear gel. It has a very light orange scent in my opinion. I use it with a soft scrub brush on my face and I apply a vitamin c serum after and my face feels so soft and smooth. I like it!</li>
    <li> I have used a variety of cleansers over the years and this one rates pretty well.  After using my face has that fresh washed feel - I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I tried to use it for at least two weeks but I started to develop bumps and my face started to become itchy :-( really hoped this product would work on me.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the rose water toner.  It makes my skin feel clean and soft after.  It doesn&#x27;t remove all of my mascara - I do have to use a makeup wipe after, but the benefits I&#x27;ve seen in my skin with this product outweigh having to use a wipe for mascara.  The cleaner just feels good - it has some graininess to it for exfoliation but leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed.  I bought this based on the reviews here and I&#x27;m so happy I did.  You really don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get a lot of good, sudsy action.  It keep my skin clear of blemishes and it just looks healthy.  Definitely a must buy.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser.  Leaves my skin fresh and soft with no reaction.  I have sensitive skin.  This removes my makeup and dirt.  My skin haa felt great since using this cleanser.</li>
    <li> This was for a family member. She states its a good product..</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser a few weeks. It&#x27;s working better than my store bought cleaners (cetaphil/neutragena). I feel it leaves my skin soft, it&#x27;s clearing up blemishes and most importantly it&#x27;s not drying out my skin as most products tend to do. Because of how much better I feel it&#x27;s cleans my skin without drying it, I plan to keep using it. The drawbacks are the scent, as initially I was very turned off by it but I&#x27;m getting used to it. Second, it stings the eyes. My husband purchased this product in a bundle for himself and so I decided to try it although I was skeptical it would help the skin issues I was having of oily/dry patches, redness, breakouts but it has. I&#x27;m now considering a moisturizer. I was surprised to see the price of about twenty five dollars for just the cleanser.</li>
    <li> The best facial cleanser!!!</li>
    <li> leaves your face feeling like new I am actually impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this face cleanser!  I have very sensitive skin and must be careful about face products.  This cleanser is very gentle yet leaves your skin clean and fresh feeling.  It breaks down makeup well.  I love the pump bottle as well.  It has a nice refreshing scent.  Many cleansers leave your skin feeling dry, but this cleanser leaves my face feeling very nice.  Not dry, yet not oily.  I love that this is an all natural product!  All around, it&#x27;s a great cleanser!</li>
    <li> re: Vitamin C Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;10% Glycolic Acid Cream&lt;br /&gt;Skin Brightening Scrub&lt;br /&gt;Skin Bfightneing Serum&lt;br /&gt;Skin Brightening Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great line of products. I created my own routine with them and it&#x27;s working out great. Look forward to sampling other items. I used the Vitamin C Cleanser twice a day; morning and night. It left my face really light and moisteurized. The lather is quite leathery so it does not drip so I also used it as a five minute mask. I added some 100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil when using it as a mask for a deep cleanse/conditioning. The jojoba oil has a trace of scent; some companies remove the scent completely, but it&#x27;s good it smells some, that way I know what jojoba smells like, or kind of, since I&#x27;ve never seen jojobas up close. Also, it worked really well as a hot oil treatment to prepare the skin for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned about the orange color of the 10% Glycolic Acid Cream, until I read the &amp;#34;tips and directions&amp;#34; email, which stated that&#x27;s the color it&#x27;s supposed to be. my concern was I didn&#x27;t wanna look like I got a fake tan. Then I read the part about the sun exposure, at which point I decided to rinse it out after ten minutes. Its absorbed quickly and the orange does go away. This cream is great because it&#x27;s not too heavy when applied, and even after rinsing it out my skin felt moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Anytime I see &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; on a product I think of the crazy celebrities that bleach their skin to truly ugly and quickly noticeable results, that act like they look great and nothing&#x27;s wrong. So I approached the &amp;#34;Skin Brightening&amp;#34; line: Scrub, Serum, and Lotion with care and made sure to read the instructions and suggestions prior to use. The Skin Brightening Scrub I used twice a week, and the Skin Brightening Serum and the Skin Britghtening Lotion every other day, twice a day. because I have recurring acne I found the scrub a bit strong, though it does have a pleasant citrus scent, as does the serum. The lotion also has a trace of citrus scent. In combination, I found the line to help recede the acne noticeably after each use. As I never used a serum before I wonder if the filmsy texture after it dries is a natural occurance of using a serum? Or did I use too much? a little goes a long way on the lotion: the first few times I used way too much, now I use it one pump at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Since I got each of these products for review at a $1 each, I&#x27;d imagine that paying the full retail value would run quite steep, also considering I am used to pharmacy brand and Neutrogena products. For the time I&#x27;ve been using them, I did find these to work really well for me. it could be that my face had hit a &amp;#34;product plateau&amp;#34; and using new ones gave it a little something extra? Overall keep up the good work on these products, it&#x27;s a definite recommend.ough it does have a pleasant citrus scent, as does the serum. The lotion also has a trace of citrus scent.

    <li> This cleanser is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Over the last several months I&#x27;ve been adding to and swapping products in my skin care routine. I think I finally found the perfect combination! I use this cleanser twice a day,  except when I use the instanatural vitamin c brightening scrub twice a week, a &amp;#34;pro-a&amp;#34; serum at night, a vitamin c serum in the morning, and day and evening moisturizers by image skincare. The combination of products has allowed me to stop using the oral prescription medications my dermatologist prescribed for acne. Further, I the dark spots from acne scaring has faded dramatically and my skin is very clear. At 34 years old, I have the best skin of my life. I only wear makeup for special occasions, because I feel confident enough to let my skin be natural. I recently visited my dermatologist who attributed the improvements to good exfoliation. The products I&#x27;ve been using as less expensive than some of the spa lines I&#x27;ve tried in the past, which makes my routine sustainable without sacrificing results. I&#x27;d almost argue that I get better results now! I have also been using a clarisonic brush for the last three years, so while I&#x27;m sure it helps, it&#x27;s not the sole reason for improvement.</li>
    <li> Love the way my face feels</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Vitamin C &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34; and this definitely is my favorite cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried. First off, I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the bottle. 8 fl oz doesn&#x27;t seem much, but it was actually a nice size bottle. I use this twice a day, everyday. In the morning, it&#x27;s become my routine in the shower. It&#x27;s refreshing and it&#x27;s crisp scent perks me up. At night before bed, I cleanse my face from all the make-up and dirt from the day. Just a few pumps goes a long way. It leaves my face feeling fresh and bright. It contains Organic Aloe Vera &amp; 10% Vitamin C  which are great antioxidants. It helps diminish sun spot and/or dark areas of the face. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer as well. I purchased this product at a promotional price to product test. I thoroughly enjoy using this product and recommend it as a regular beauty regiment.</li>
    <li> I brought this cleaner for 2 weeks, I hv large pore and oil skin, i like it so much and feel my skin texture hv improved and clear a lot.</li>
    <li> so far so good,  to early to make a comment. Thanks</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Cleanser makes my face feel refreshing and does dry it out.</li>
    <li> I like the vitamin C cleanser. It does not have a strong fragrant smell yet it does smell natural and without harsh or heavy chemicals. It certainly gets the job done. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and cleansed while not drying out my skin, which is often times a problem for me when using face washes. I like the bottle size as well as I appreciate the price point. I like this product and will purchase it again when in need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use the skin brightening scrub (3-4 times a week), the skin brightening serum (twice a day), as well as the vitamin C face wash daily my skin has become less problematic, smoother and more clear. All in all I have seen a difference in my skin since I have started using these products :)</li>
    <li> This smells so amazing. Left my skin feeling soft, refreshed, and smelling so good. Will continue to use !</li>
    <li> This is my second time that I purchase the products from InstaNatural. I love their serum so I decide to try their cleanser. However, Im kind of disappointed about the package.  Even though the bottle is sealed, but when I open the wrap bubble, there are a lot of liquid that leaked from the cleansers. The amount is lost.  Haiz</li>
    <li> Love this product! This cleanser is amazing.  Leaves my face soft and moisturized. Since using this cleanser and a few of their other face products for anti-aging for only a few weeks, I&#x27;ve gotten several comments about looking younger.  Will definitely continue using and purchase more when finished with this bottle. My husband is using the product too and seems to like it.</li>
    <li> love this cleanser/ it has cleared up some light acne and is brightening my skin</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL.  If you are looking for a great cleanser... this.  After two weeks all of my pesky stress breakouts are gone and my skin feels GREAT.  Not exaggerating y&#x27;all need it.  I used to use bare minerals and switching was scary but I am beyond glad I did.  A wonderful line for your skincare at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Very comfortable after using it every time.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It lasts so long! Vitamin C is great for your skin. This cleanser leaves your skin silky and healthy looking!</li>
    <li> My face is very sensitive but I still decided to try this. I am glad I did it left my skin feeling hydrated and nice and clean I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this facial cleanser. I have very sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had a problem using this product. It has a nice fresh crisp smell to it and it makes your face feel the same after using it; fresh and crisp! I love that it&#x27;s also sulfate free because that is usually what gives most cleansers the nasty smell. Vitamin C is so good for your skin and this cleanser definitely has the right thing going. I use it every day and so does my husband. It&#x27;s totally safe to use on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling soft and rejuvenated and lately I&#x27;ve noticed that my complexion has improved! I always thought I had a really good complexion to begin with, but this has improved it even more. Didn&#x27;t really think that could happen. My husband is also prone to breakouts after he does his workouts and since he&#x27;s been using this his breakouts have been minimal or not as bad if he does get any sort of breakout. I would say that&#x27;s a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and will most likely be buying more of it once it run out.</li>
    <li> Love all my InstaNatural products.  Got the Vit C cleanser, the serum, the sunblock also the retinol cream to use in the evening.  Nice light products.  My face appears to be very bright and clean.</li>
    <li> I see a big difference in my skin and I&#x27;ve only used it twice!  Will definitively buy it again and will be recommending it!</li>
    <li> I love this face cleaner! It cleaned my skin really well and left it soft and smooth without feeling dry or over moisturized. It doesn&#x27;t have any strong scents so it shouldn&#x27;t bother anyone with allergies. I will buy this again for sure. I also used it as a body wash and had the same affect. It seems to be quite concentrated so a lot goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to use this product! I love it! Nice lather and feels great after using!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this cleanser does not have smell. and this clean my face really good and also its kind of thick gel which is okay.&lt;br /&gt;I just finished my olay cleanser and I am trying this for the 1st time, so far its doing it job well.</li>
    <li> Some pros to this are that its not tested on animals and that is made in the USA. I love that it has a pump for nice easy dispense. It has a lovely scent and creates a nice foamy lather. My skin felt smoother and tighter after just once use. I will continue to use these products and try to update my findings!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. My face feels very clean and it&#x27;s easy on the skin. Will def be getting it again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser!!!!  It&#x27;s made my skin so much softer and younger looking.  I will definitely be keeping this in stock.  Thank you InstaNatural!!!!</li>
    <li> Great cleanser goes well with the serum.  The only problem, it does not remove my mascara which can be removed with soap.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this cleanser for 6 months non drying and my dark spots have diminished. I will continue to use the excellent product</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It leaves my face soft, doesn&#x27;t dry it out like a lot of soaps. It also goes along way..all you need is a little drop!  I saw an ad for it in a magazine and checked it out. so happy I did!</li>
    <li> This is a big bottle and great size for the price.  I like that it&#x27;s vitamin C!!!  It leaves my skin feeling smooth.  It burned my eyes a little bit the first time I tried it, but now it doesn&#x27;t burn.  I suppose I was just getting used to it.  Overall, I like this product</li>
    <li> Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This review is for this company&#x27;s customer service in regards to this facial cleaner.  I did not get the results I wanted from this cleanser.  I have incredibly sensitive skin and it just didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped.  It wasn&#x27;t horrible or anything, just not something for my unique skin needs.  That being said, I need to give this cleanser a 5 star review because the company reached out to me for to ensure I was satisfied and upon hearing I wasn&#x27;t, I had a refund in my amazon account that day.  WOW!  I was so impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy from this company.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t make my face feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Give my face a healthy look.&lt;br /&gt;- No clogged pores due to the use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is different, not bad... just different. It may take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;- DO NOT LET THIS GET CLOSE TO YOUR EYES. Holy cow it burns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Summary:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy who usually uses plain old soap and water, but I got this so cheap I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I really like this a lot, I have a form of cancer that really dries out my skin a lot and the areas of my face that are affected have really helped to clear up the dry spots once I started using this. I definitely notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use it for a day, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad. Either way, the product works well and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face or make it look oily at all.</li>
    <li> I can feel my face tightening after using this cleanser and my face is clean, but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the cleanser is that it kind of smells weird.</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser, I use it every single day! Also a little half a pump is more than enough product to wash your whole face, so this big bottle will last for over 6 months!!!</li>
    <li> I love this clearer it&#x27;s perfect and I already notice a glow&amp; it&#x27;s only been a week. Defiantly a great product</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  It cleanses well without drying my skin.  I also recommend the Vitamin C Serum.  They are perfect together.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of InstaNatural products and after reading all the reviews on their new Vitamin C Facial Cleanser, I couldn&#x27;t help myself from trying it so I could see what all the hype was about. I have been using this cleanser for about three days now and I am highly impressed with the results that I&#x27;ve seen! My dark spots are fading drastically day by day, my complexion is a&#x27; lot more clear and even and my face feels like it is being deeply cleaned without being irritated. I enjoy that there are no harsh chemicals in this cleanser and that it is all natural and organic. As far as the smell goes it is neutral, meaning that it smells neither good or bad. It has a very pure almost medicinal type of smell which I don&#x27;t mind at all. You only need about a half a pump of the cleanser to clean your face, it goes on smooth and rinses off smooth as well. I would recommend you washing your face with your eyes closed as they do burn really badly if you get the cleanser in them. This cleanser not only deep cleans, but also moisturizes, and tighten my skins in the same token. If you have acne or marks that are leftover from acne and you are looking for something to save your skin I highly recommend this product, it will do wonders for you! This is a great cleanser and I now look forward to washing my face day and night! Thank you so much InstaNatural! Keep doing what yall are doing! I have found a cleanser for life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving this wash. Not only does it make my skin feel soft and clean. I also love the smell. I will be buying when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff... My only issue with it, is that it does leak a little bit and I am frequently getting rings at the bottom.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser!  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face while doing an excellent job cleaning my skin.  InstaNatural products are truly awesome and I love the Vitamin C.  I highly recommend this product.  Terrific customer service and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I really like this facial cleaner. It works on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My face feels very clean and also fresh when I use this. A tiny bit goes a long way. So far I am liking it very much.</li>
    <li> This is a nice face wash that has a lot of anti-aging ingredients. It lathers nicely so you only need a little bit. It does not really have a scent.  My face feels nice and clean afterwards and still soft.  Sulfate free, hydrating, and soothing face wash. Great product!</li>
    <li> Smells so good and leaves your face squeaky clean</li>
    <li> This product has a noticeable smell, but unlike some others it isn&#x27;t a harsh one. Neither is the cleanser itself. This cleanser is very effective because it is very smooth to apply and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling super dry. Apply some InstaNatural Jojoba Oil after using this cleanser and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> Resulted in lots of acne on my face</li>
    <li> Vitamin C cleanser is great for removing makeup and debris.  Be careful to not get near eyes as it does sting a bit. Otherwise a solid product and would reorder.</li>
    <li> Love this!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and I love it! I use a spin brush with it and it forms like bubbles, and i love it! Great quality!! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Can I give it 10 stars? I use this daily and love it!!! It has a thick texture and leaves my face soft and hydrated. I really love this face wash!</li>
    <li> Have a very pleasant scent.  Skin feel soft and make look plump.  Clean the make up pretty good also.</li>
    <li> I tried many cleaner but this definitely my favorite. It&#x27;s gentle, smooth, natural and has vitamin C on it! My skin is a bit sensitive so I&#x27;m glad I found this cleanser. I definitely will recommend this to anyone. Love your skin and use this natural skin cleanser.</li>
    <li> i dont know that ive seen a difference YET. it has a nice consistency, if kind of thick. it doesnt lather big time, but i also use cetaphil which also doesnt lather. so im used to lack of lather. the smell isnt too strong, even though it&#x27;s citrusy. only complaint is that this stuff BURNS like mad if it gets into your eyes. ive actually NEVER used a facial cleanser in 20+ years that burned my eyes that way. that was unfortunate.**update: broke me out terribly. Not sure if it was the brand or formula, but I had to throw this away. :(</li>
    <li> Great cleanser and not harsh on the face... I love using this cleanser in the hot shower and when removing make up... Most cleansers tend yo irritate my skin but this one has yet to .</li>
    <li> The best of the best.  Leaves your face feeling fresh and clean.  Great product to start your day.  Must try it!!</li>
    <li> both my teenage girls love the vitamin c products!  One daughter has really sensative skin to most products and seems to be okay with this one. Glad we found one that works for both girls</li>
    <li> Madly in love with this face wash.very little goes long way..I have a very sensitive skin n my husband  a very oily acni skin n v both r loving this product .this product was Sent to me for $1 for try n review  if I liked or not..m even using this product for my 2year old daughter to wash her face...never till date ne face wash suited my skin .every time I tried ne face wash it left me with dry patchy skin around my eye area but this product is truly a blessing for my face .thanks instanatural</li>
    <li> Love the cleanser! It leaves my face feeling soft and clean. I personally like a cleaner that is a little sudsy and this one does lather nicely but not too much. Does not dry out my skin. The cleaner is in addition to some of the face serums I am using (love those!) along with the eye gel. Next I will be adding the toner and moisturizers as I phase out of my current aveda products.</li>
    <li> Smell is really terrible though....I have to put my towel into washer every other day to avoid the smell...</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser, it&#x27;s gentle and leaves your face feeling refreshed!  I&#x27;m really bad about remembering to use these types of things, but this stuff is awesome, I actually look forward to it!</li>
    <li> This product have been one of the best the I ever use you feel m see the different</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty in love with this cleanser! I&#x27;ve been a firm supporter of my usual go to cleanser, but this is going into rotation now. I&#x27;ve seen my skin even in tone a good bit from use and it feels cleaner!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why I expect this face wash to have some type of a citrus smell to it.  It has none.  At first, I don&#x27;t know if I like it or not, but after about a week&#x27;s use, I really like it.  It  cleans very well; my t-zone is squeaky clean!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT CLEANSER. I BEEN WAITING FOR A NON OIL  CLEANSER FROM INSTANATURAL,  THIS  FIT  MY BILL 100% . GOOD  CLEANING. NON DRYING/ JUST WHAT I  WANTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE BEEN GIVE A CHANCE TO TEST THIS WITH  DISCOUNT, BUT MY OPINION IS UNBIASED AND  HONEST.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It is the best cleanser I have ever used.  I am now a devoted customer.</li>
    <li> Love it, highly refreshing cleanser, smells great and feels great on your skin. My favourite so far. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a good cleanser for me. I like that it makes my skin feel CLEAN without it feeling stripped, dry or tight.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got the handy pump and you only need a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice a smell at all and I see that some say they did. Maybe my nose is weak at smelling. You know, you start gettin&#x27; old and stuff like that happens. I better hide, because my bladder could be next!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had zero breakouts, but I am not prone to breaking out. My biggest skin issue is that I am starting to get wrinkles. I&#x27;m fortunate to have made it to 56 before I really noticed that. Having stated that, I do plan to try more products from this line. I think next I&#x27;ll try the neck firming cream. My neck isn&#x27;t bad, but my jawline needs to stay where it is and not become a part of my neck. ACK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY down side to this is that it seems to burn my eyes if I do not REALLY RINSE WELL. So, if you get this stuff, make sure to rinse your eye area diligently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY, I ordered a second bottle recently and that means I like it and am not reviewing it because I got a free sample, BECAUSE I DIDN&#x27;T.</li>
    <li> I liked this cleanser very much. It removes make up completely and leaves skin feeling so clean but not dried out. I did receive this product at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion. I do plan on using it in the future.</li>
    <li> So far i have enjoyed this product</li>
    <li> This burned my eyes and made me break out. Sometimes vitamin C makes certain people break out, which I&#x27;ve learned over time, and this product doesn&#x27;t work well if you&#x27;re prone to vitamin C sensitivity. It might be great for those who vitamin C helps with acne, but if you&#x27;re not one of them, avoid this product. Also, I believe face soap should be gentle and not stripping of natural oils. This soap is harsh, burns, and strips away natural oils. It&#x27;s also insanely expensive for soap.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this Cleanser !!!!! a small amount goes a long way !!!! I received this cleaner to review as part of a promotion ! I can honestly say I love everything about it . The scent is refreshing w/out being overpowering . It is one of the best face washes I&#x27;ve tried . this face wash doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling all dried out and that makes me happy :) Just clean and fresh !!  ! can Honestly recommend this amazing vitamin C face wash with out hesitation :)</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to like this cleanser, but I do not. I don&#x27;t feel it is cleaning my skin like some other products have. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I like this.  Too soon to tell if it is making a difference, but face feels clean and soft.  Since Vit C is supposed to help with brown spots, I was watching one particular area to see if it makes a difference.  It takes just a small amount of product to wash face so this should last rather long time.</li>
    <li> A great morning cleanser, a light fragrance. Does not dry. Perfect to get all of the impurities out first thing in the morning.</li>
    <li> Another awesome product that works</li>
    <li> Love it.. get compliments on my skin and have recommended it. Will purchase another.</li>
    <li> It does kindof smell but it works very well cleansing my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about cleansers. They have to be the right consistency and the right cleansing capability. Cleansing without over-stripping is a problem for most products, they either leave the skin feeling dry and tight or oily and dirty. This seems to really hit the spot. If I&#x27;m in a hurry, I can even walk out the door without applying a lotion or toner. I love that! I&#x27;d really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this facial cleanser. I have used it for at least a week or so now. The smell is great and it is so easy to use, just pump the pump one time and a nice amount of cleanser comes out. The first time I pumped it two times and too much came out, I learned my lesson. I like that my face feels so nice and clean when I use this cleanser. My face is usually dry and it is no longer dry since I have used this product. It is a nice big bottle so it should last a long time, it&#x27;s an 8 fl oz bottle . I like that it has 10% vitamin c, organic aloe vera, and rosehip oil. I also like that it is sulfate-free.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is made in the USA, not a lot of products are still made in the states. It has a manufacturer warranty with a 100% satisfaction guarantee, no matter where you buy their product. If you&#x27;re not fully satisfied, contact them and get a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion</li>
    <li> very soothing formula and works so well with the other InstaNatural products I purchased.</li>
    <li> I love using this cleanser.  It has a thick rich texture. My face feels clean and moist after use.  Again instanatural has the best skin care products of any I have ever tried. The fact it is all natural is an added plus.  My skin&#x27;s tone and texture have improved so that my husband has been commenting on how good my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I started using this face wash and after about a week I was seeing results. I have acne prone skin since my 9th grade year in high school, and now  I am a Junior in college still trying to figure out my acne. After I started using this wash I paired it with two other products by the same company; http://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Serum-20-Hyaluronic-InstaNatural/dp/B00NY5NGPE/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_194_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1QS7Q2JBBZ8T63Y8S2PS and http://www.amazon.com/Rose-Water-Toner-Face-Moisturizers/dp/B00IMHN0B4/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_194_24?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0PBJJ1WT2NY3179SQZNV. Due to the fact that I started using all three around the same time, I am not able to say if one of the products works better than the other. But, I am able to say that all three of these products together have cleared up my face better than any other brand or product I have used.</li>
    <li> I purchased the cleanser along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and use the two products together. My previous cleanser was made up of unpronounceable chemicals, and I feel so much better using a product that is natural and organic. It cleanses very well, and as other reviewers have said, a little bit goes a long way. It is not harsh or drying to the skin at all, and at this point in my life, this is a big plus! It has a faint smell but is not annoying or offensive to me. I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I returned this because it burned and stung my eyes every time.</li>
    <li> This has replaced my old facial cleanser as my new favorite. I love how it lathers, and it leaves my skin feeler fresh and smooth. I also have noticed an increased softness.</li>
    <li> Usually face washes will make my face red from irritation, so as usual I was hesitant on trying something new. Thankfully this didn&#x27;t turn my face red. It has a pleasant sent to it and suds up really nice so you don&#x27;t have to use as much as others.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful skin cleanser and makes your skin feel magnificient. I felt very hydrated and energized after using it</li>
    <li> Strange smell. Looks like the product has expired or was stored improperly. Also, grease feeling after application. My face does not feel cleaned. I use several InstaNatural products, including creams, serums, etc., all have been great, all bought from Amazon...</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. Smells great &amp; leaves your skin feeling so soft.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is great!  It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner and product line, will continue to repurchase</li>
    <li> This is the best line of skin care. This is my first time trying this skin care line and i love it. My skin looks healthier after the first week. I will continue to buy this line of skin care without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a month now. Havent seen any difference in my skin. Although I like how it feels during application and it has a nice non-irritating smell.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel very clean and nice. A little goes a long way which I like!</li>
    <li> leaves my skin squeaky clean. and great for removing my hard to remove my sunscreen A+ product did exactly what it said it would.</li>
    <li> This product cleaned my face thoroughly and left it feeling fresh.  It moisturized and made my skin looking younger and smoother.  It helped repair the razor burn after shaving well also.</li>
    <li> Great product, you can instantly feel it going to work! Although I would not suggest using it near the eyes as it will sting ...</li>
    <li> Item arrived right away and is one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve ever owned you only need to use a small amount and it covers your face perfectly with a very smooth good cleaning. Skin feels amazing and glowy after washing in the morning and before bed deff recommend this item with its amazing natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> My morning regimen now.. Wakes me up nicely!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft.  Will definitely purchase again.  Customer service is outstanding!!!</li>
    <li> This face wash leaves your skin so soft and so refreshed.  I can tell a huge difference after just a few days and now after a few weeks I can&#x27;t imagine washing my face with anything else.  My skin texture is so much better now with this face cleanser than it was before my thyroid messed up on me.</li>
    <li> This cleanser smells great and does not leave my face feeling tight.  After using the cleanser for a week, I noticed a slight difference in my skin.  I have pretty clear skin in general and get random breakouts.  I feel like so many cleansers take a while to get used to and make my face break out before they help.. this product did not!  Its nice and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am not surprise the InstaNatural cleanser would be any different quality than their other products.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser leaves my oily skin clean but also soft at the same time. And I love the Vitamin C in products like this,because it helps making me look rest and fresh.</li>
    <li> What an amazing cleanser!  This product is refreshing and revitalizing.  I love that it is suitable for my sensitive skin, and leaves my face feeling clean and glowing!  It is not harsh and brightens my skin.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great scent, great lather. I really like most of InstaNaturals&#x27; products and this one is just as good as the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh feeling when you wash your face with this cleanser.  It has a lovely lovely scent, and a little goes a long way.  I will definitely purchasing this cleanser again!</li>
    <li> What can i say about this product... i love it, i like the size of the bottle and how easy is to get the product of the pump bottle.the cleanser smells goods and I like how my skin feels and looks after each use,I have oily skin and since I start using the cleanser my skin looks a lot better.</li>
    <li> One of the big benefits this product touts is the vitamin C, but vitamin C has a short shelf life so I wouldn&#x27;t make that the main reason I buy this product - that claim seems kind of gimmicky to me. You can go on YouTube and find videos on how to make a vitamin C serum that can really help your skin. I buy the ingredients right here on Amazon and make my serum in very small batches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said I still love this product! I have been using it every day for the past week and a half. I&#x27;ve used it with just my fingers and I have used it with my Clairsonic Plus. Using both methods I was seriously surprised at how much of my makeup was removed using this cleanser - especially just using my fingers! Normally there is still makeup residue on my skin afterwards, but with this cleanser the residue was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I like about this product is that my skin didn&#x27;t feel super dry afterwards like I cleaned my skin with detergent. I can tell they don&#x27;t have a lot of fillers in this either because it didn&#x27;t get super soapy even when I used the Clairsonic - just a minimal lather. That is something I REALLY liked about this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural provided this cleanser for my review and feedback.</li>
    <li> Love the way this product leaves my skin very happy</li>
    <li> Just a small amount of this face wash goes a long way! It leaves your skin feeling clean and moisturized!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleaner, the scent is pleasant Imo and it leaves my skin very refreshed and feeling clean. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I can definitely see a big difference in my skin tone and overall condition of my skin. I have a very sensitive skin and this product is not at all irritating which is great and I am super happy about it.</li>
    <li> Great Product so far.  I have very dry skin and this does not dry me out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  just recently purchased this cleanser. I&#x27;m convinced that I finally discover the correct cleanser for my face. In the past, I&#x27;ve tried so many different cleansers that usually  dry my skin. But this vitamin c cleanser leave my skin clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I use this every day.  I love the orange smell &amp; leaves an orange tint. Great product, I got mine from Elite Deal Club &amp; plan on buying more in the future</li>
    <li> the good, skin feels so nice after I wash it. .&lt;br /&gt;not so good. . burns my eyes. . but have only had this issue a few times.. .</li>
    <li> Refreshing and strips all dirt from my skin.</li>
    <li> Feels good, smells nice, exfoliates perfectly and gently, without overdoing.  No strong scents, no irritation of my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Left with clean, moist skin that seems to be more receptive to moisturizers and makeup.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, it works very well without drying my face out</li>
    <li> This product has really helped clear up my breakouts, and leaves my skin feeling so smooth! I have been so impressed after only a few weeks of use. My pores already look smaller (to me, at least) and I am so pleased that my face has cleared up so much. I also love the light scent that it offers. Great cleanser!</li>
    <li> Scent less but thick big bottle</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Facial Cleanser is one of the best out there. It is a decent size bottle which is always nice. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a girl so my fiance can use it as well. It has a very subtle orange scent to it, This product helps to reduce the formation of sun spots, discoloration, dullness, wrinkles and fine lines caused by over sun exposure. It made my skin feel soft and moisturized while giving me that fresh clean feeling as well. It is the perfect product to wake you up in the morning.</li>
    <li> It smells like 11 little boys who&#x27;ve been playing outside all day. Pure stank. That being said, when I noticed that I looked like a princess after I washed my face, I suddenly didn&#x27;t care as much about the funk fumes.  Great lather, cleans amazingly, turns you into a princess, smells like the bitter tears of starving babies. Worth it.</li>
    <li> I am on my third bottle of this cleanser and  I absolutely love it! I have purchased other products from InstaNatural (Youth Express Eye Gel and the Hyaluronic Acid Serum) and couldn&#x27;t be happier! My morning and nighttime regimen include all three products. My face is smooth and soft and appears more youthful! My family and  friends have commented on how bright my face looks :) I&#x27;m a lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I am very happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far. I have very sensitive skin prone to acne and eczema. This product cleared up a problem eczema patch I was having in a few days. I enjoy how clean my skin feels afterwards and I&#x27;ve been following up with instanaturals vitamin c moisturizer. My only complaints with the product is the smell is not very pleasant and there&#x27;s something in the product that is strong enough to irritate my eyes if I try to open them while washing my face. However, those complaints are relatively small when compared to the results of the product. I definitely had my doubts about this product, but was pleasantly surprised with how well my skin is doing. Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently products, but I would recommend giving this one a try.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin with adult onset acne and have been switching products for years. This didn&#x27;t give me any problems, my skin shows less irritation and breakouts after 3 weeks of use.  My skin looks softer, less visible lines.  I plan to keep this cleanser in stock.</li>
    <li> My skin is improving a lot, it feels and looks better. So far, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on wrinkles but my acne scars are almost disappearing.</li>
</ol>
