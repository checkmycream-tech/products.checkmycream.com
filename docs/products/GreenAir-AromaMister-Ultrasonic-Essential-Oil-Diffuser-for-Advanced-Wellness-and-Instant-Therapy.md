<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It worked really well the first few times I used it,  then gradually the mist became less and less.  I tried popping out the plastic center,  and the mist still didn&#x27;t increase.  But if I lifted the lid,  a cloud of mist would billow out.  Very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I love diffusers and this was the second one I have bought from Amazon. It is beautiful to look at with the changing colors, and you can even set a certain color. The ONLY issue I have is that it will randomly cut off. The description gives it a 4 hour running time...more like 2 hours, sometimes 15 minutes, sometimes 5. I have checked the water level and everything seems fine? Maybe I just got one that is unpredictable? Regardless, it does what it says minus the running time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Works great and love the auto turn off when it runs out of water.</li>
    <li> I liked the product for the last month. However, it&#x27;s been a month and a few days since I purchased it and started using it. It will not work now. It worked nicely, but shouldn&#x27;t stop working after a month. It seems to be not as well made as other diffusers I have.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a diffuser.  I wasn&#x27;t doing something right because there was no mist coming out and water was spilling out overnight. My third night I moved it around a bit and it ended up working correctly. I&#x27;m sure it was all my error. Now that it&#x27;s in the right spot it seems to be working great. I probably add more oils than I&#x27;m suppose to but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> Great diffuser! Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like the diffuser but it only lasts for 4hrs.  It makes my whole house smell really nice, I just wish it would last longer.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my entire room smell wonderful with just a few drops of oil. I also love how it changes colors and has an automatic turn off after 4 hours.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift in December 2014, used at night in my daughter&#x27;s room for 3 months and it just died! The unit would run all night and wouldn&#x27;t diffuse any water/oils. The bottom of the unit would be Hot to the touch... Major fire hazard in my opinion. Only has a 30 day guarantee. If someone believes their product is the best on the market, wouldn&#x27;t it have more than a 30 day return policy? Waste of Money!</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what appears in the pictures, works great and I love putting my favorite essential oils in the diffuser.  I now have one at home and one in my office.</li>
    <li> great price and delivery.</li>
    <li> I got two of these, the most recent one seems to keep running even when I turn it off but leave it plugged in, so I havent been using it much lately. Too much going on in life to return it right now.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use. However, it has nowhere near the output of my other diffuser, regularly gets clogged and needs cleaning.</li>
    <li> And I am not happy with the company that is handling this 30 day or 30 minutes warranty product either. What, named Day Dream, should be named Day Ream for selling such junk.</li>
    <li> Works great and changes colors love my diffuser.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried to purchase this since some of the reviews claimed it stopped working after a few days.  You&#x27;ll notice in the instruction manual that is says to let vinegar sit in it after every 8 hours of use. I&#x27;m thinking that the people whose units didn&#x27;t last didn&#x27;t read the instructions. I&#x27;ve been using mine all day, every day for 2 months so far and it works perfectly. Every other day I clean it (I go a little longer than recommended, it takes 15 minutes). Very happy with this. 4 other people have bought one after seeing mine.</li>
    <li> I like it so far.  However, I would have liked to have known beforehand that citrus essential oils should be avoided because they can damage the unit.</li>
    <li> works great I love it</li>
    <li> they are great and I love them very timely thank you</li>
    <li> Great Product. I am really impressed with the ease of use. I have had an opportunity to use various essential oils using the diffuser. The house smells great- very relaxing.</li>
    <li> This is perfect and a perfect price!  Love all the colors it changes too. Works great. Come right on time.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it and the changing colors</li>
    <li> I have 3 units and love them - works very well in bedroom and bath areas</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery! Great gift for family members!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use! Works great!</li>
    <li> Much better than spa vapor unit as far as quality.  Colors are pleasant. Very easy to use.  Main negative is that plug-in is under unit.</li>
    <li> I love this product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> great product.  I use it almost every day!</li>
    <li> I love my diffuser and although it says it will last up to 4 hours, mine has gone for up to 12 hours!</li>
    <li> Great transaction! Great product!</li>
    <li> Product came packaged well, just as it was online. Works well. ty DF</li>
    <li> Love using this product.</li>
    <li> Started making a loud buzzing sound after about a week of light use. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this diffuser. It lasts for the six hours it states, I love the rotating colors, and I use this while working in a large office room with many dividers and the smell is noticeable at least half way down which is just amazing to me. Scents has nothing on this by smell and I get use my essential oils that provide therapeutic benefits along with a great smell. It&#x27;s a great price too! I&#x27;ve had this diffuser for at least 4 weeks and I will definitely buy more for my bedrooms and gifts.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and store</li>
    <li> I really like this diffuser.  It is VERY quiet and I use it in my son&#x27;s room because he likes the changing light colors at night.  It goes thru the water pretty quickly so it does not diffuse for more than 2 hours at a time...which works better for me since I would rather it turn itself off after he falls asleep.  Very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Works well and looks nice.  It would be nice if the lights could be turned on without the mist, though.</li>
    <li> Works ok, I live the aroma at bed time. I would like to have the option for it not to light up. I like it dark to sleep</li>
    <li> Love this product so much!</li>
    <li> I use this for my sons bedroom every single night. He loves and and so do i!</li>
    <li> Before posting anything negative about the product, i highly recommend to work with their customer service if you have any problems. They are very helpful and make sure you are satisfied with the purchase....( and will replace anything that is not functional as long as you keep the communicating).&lt;br /&gt;My diffuser works great now! Love it and thanks again!</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this product for our bed room and we loved it so much, that we got another one for the living room and buying 2 more for Christmas presents to relatives.</li>
    <li> I ordered this 2 weeks ago and it already doesn&#x27;t work!!!! So frustrated!</li>
    <li> I love our diffuser! We&#x27;ve used it everyday since it arrived and it works perfectly. Agree with previous post, reading the instructions and following them has proven to be advantageous.</li>
    <li> Well, I was fascinated by how this works or worked should I say.  We used it twice and it died........ dead........ and it would not turn back on the button would flicker when pushed and nothing. So I returned it to Amazon for Credit.</li>
    <li> I have two of these and I love them. Very easy to use and maintain. I also have 3 other of greenairs diffusers and the CarAroma. I also purchased an additional one for Christmas as a gift.</li>
    <li> works great to diffuse essential oils.  highly recommend</li>
    <li> Bought it for daughters birthday present.  She says she really likes it and so far no problems.  I have heard some diffusers stop working within a short time, so we shall see about this one.  We use Young Living essential oils.</li>
    <li> I use this every other night with elemi, I love how I don&#x27;t have to worry about waking up to shut it off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this diffuser for my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s room.  It&#x27;s great for smaller sized rooms. The changing colors option is wonderful as it also provides a visually soothing component to help her fall asleep at night.</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser this is now my favorite!  Love that you can use with the light or without!  No more having to sleep with a annoying light on!!  Thanks so much!  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering more in the near future!</li>
    <li> I have no idea how the product works. This is because we did not receive a power cord. I contacted the manufacture and I&#x27;m hoping they will send me one otherwise I have to return. I gave one star because I did not get the power cord.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE! The product photos have been altered. THE PRODUCT I received continuously diffuses for 4 hours with 4 LED changing light colors. The specs section of the box specifies 6 changes but 4 colors (?). The product I received is NOT the one in the large photos but does match the written description. Not up to par for Amazon in my opinion. Extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and it is much loved by it&#x27;s new owner!</li>
    <li> The unit worked only a few times.I have cleaned it etc and still it is nonfunctional. I will work to get it replaced as I can tell i really like diffusing oils and want the benefits from it during this cold and flu season. THats why I dont like it right now!</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly.  It was given as a gift and they loved it!</li>
    <li> I purchased two weeks ago and the mister  stopped working yesterday. Short lived for two weeks.  I tried calling the company but to reply.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase for an electric, misting difuser and I am very pleased with it. It starts up quickly, easy to follow directions, easy to clean. It automatically shuts off if when the liquid is gone. So far, I am very happy with my purchase and it was a reasonable cost, especially compared with the Young Living diffuser.</li>
    <li> 3 stars due to it being so loud. I bought this for my bedroomI love the color change I love the length of time it stays on but it&#x27;s so loud with a constant humming</li>
    <li> Love my Diffuser...arrived on time and very satifies with the product!</li>
    <li> Good so far,  sometimes diffusers at this price don&#x27;t work for very long but at this point, it has been a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This little diffuser works well. It is an appropriate size for a room that isn&#x27;t too big.</li>
    <li> I cannot keep this by my bed where I wanted it because it makes a high pitch whirring sound otherwise it does what it is supposed to</li>
    <li> Works great. Fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this diffuser.  I use it every night. At one point it stopped working correctly.  I called the company and they sent out replacement parts.  I would recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect! It&#x27;s a good way to enjoy my essential oils. And the automatic shut off makes it great.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe not quitecas powerful output as the YoungLiving my wife bought but barely noticeable and also a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> It works great and I love it!</li>
    <li> fantastic diffuser!! I love the automatic shut-off feature, too :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my diffuser.  I&#x27;ve had it quite a while and my daughter uses it in her bedroom every night.  We put lavender in it to help soothe her to sleep and during homework time, we add lemongrass.  I had one small issue and called Customer Service which was listed on the bottom of the diffuser.  I spoke with a girl in Idaho named Kellie.  She was absolutely amazing and super helpful; definitely an asset to the company.  I will buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> I love the look of this diffuser and that you can use it with or without the light. I do not like how it puts out a lot of most straight up and how it settles all around the base causing it, and whatever it is sitting on to get very wet.</li>
    <li> love it easy to use and works great</li>
    <li> Economic and good looping such a great odor</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  I bought this for my mom and it works far longer than they claim.  It&#x27;s better than my NOW diffusers!</li>
    <li> Great gift for a friend.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> Crapped out after a month of owning it. It flickers when button is pushed. I probably only actively used it 5-7 times</li>
    <li> One of the 3 of these I bought would not turn on so I asked for a refund.  The others that I purchased at the same time work fine and are decent quality for the price.</li>
    <li> product worked great for several days, I then ruined it, I had gotten cooking grease on the outside and when I tried to wash it I must have gotten water in the power plug area.  I got it to work for a day after making sure it was dry, but it quit working again.  It was completely my fault though, the diffuser worked great until that time</li>
    <li> They work really well at first but then they start getting to hot and not working right.</li>
    <li> Works better than more expensive models I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This Diffuser does a great job.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son&#x27;s room and he loves it, will be ordering another one for my daughters room!</li>
    <li> I use doTerra oils in this little gem and its amazing!  Works great, runs for hours, beautiful colors changing or use solid color.  Auto shut off is a nice feature too.  It&#x27;s great!!  Reasonable price too!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this thing - Sits on my nightstand and I have lavender oil diffusing while I fall asleep.  Its so perfect I want to order more for around my home.</li>
    <li> Have been using for almost one year and it&#x27;s still working! Best oil diffuser for small-medium room sizes! Colors are nice too</li>
    <li> We were looking for a more affordable second diffuser. I followed all the instructions but there was very little mist from the beginning and after 2 nights use it would not turn off--which is a big safety hazard. We threw it out.</li>
    <li> Excellent diffuser. I use it for the living room.</li>
    <li> my daughter keeps this in her room and uses it most nights.  it is a great night-light as well as diffuser.  Love it - might get another one</li>
    <li> This one works great! I have 5 different ones and this one last.</li>
    <li> I purchased maybe a couple weeks ago, and it already doesn&#x27;t work..... I followed all directions.....I actually already have one so I know this one is crap!</li>
    <li> Perfect for diffusing essential and great price!</li>
    <li> Box says up to 4 hours....not the same as 6-8.  Disappointed when I got it.</li>
    <li> Out of all the diffusers I have purchased, I love this one the most. I use this one near the cat litter box and turn it on anytime I smell an unpleasant smell. Once I notice the unpleasant smell has left the area--I turn the diffuser off. This diffuser only needs to be refilled every 2 to 3 days. I use 2 drops of &amp;#34;purification&amp;#34; Young Living&amp;#34; essential oil each time I refill it. My cats do not smell anything after the purification oil is used--so we are all happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with essential oils. I bought this for my home and my office. This diffuser really fills the room with the right amount of scent. It&#x27;s small and the glowing setting is calming but I usually keep the light off.</li>
    <li> So far this has been the longest diffuser that&#x27;s lasted the longest for me</li>
    <li> We go to sleep with it running every night. It takes the staleness  out of the room. Would not want to do without it.</li>
    <li> Bought for a gift.  Love it.  Works great!  Works well in a medium to large room</li>
    <li> The Greenair Aroma Diffuser, Spa Mister has been a great addition to my classroom.  The peppermint oil creates a relaxing smell in my classroom.  The various colors that are displayed create a calm space.</li>
    <li> Love the Greenair Aroma Diffuser.  It is very easy to use and to clean.  The scent used is diffused quite a distance from the device itself, and the changing color is very relaxing.  My students and I missed it when it was borrowed to use in the testing room.</li>
    <li> I love my greenair Aroma Diffuser. It works great.</li>
    <li> This diffuser works great for my daycare classroom during the day and my beddroom at night. It is perfect for diffusing essential oils</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the units one has worked as expected but I had to return one of the units because it worked one time and never worked again. that is the reason I can only give a three star rating.</li>
    <li> Loved it while it worked! Co-Worker to my Wife bought same item. Both have stopped working in just over a month! Of course just out of the return time. Don&#x27;t buy unless you get a Wal-Mart return policy</li>
    <li> Worked great for a couple weeks.  Then just stopped working.  Cleaned it out one day and it would no longer light up or turn on.  Very dissapointed in this item.  Only got to use it 7 times.</li>
    <li> It diffuses great,  but the light is too bright for me for sleeping.  I should have read the review better.  Works great in the daytime.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my sister. Two days after receiving it, she called me and stated that there were missing parts. According to the instructions and the photos on Amazon, there should be a small metal ring at the bottom. Hers did not have it. I contacted the company about this issue and was informed that the metal sensor was now inside and could not be seen like the photo shows that it should.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully they will be updating the instructions and photos soon to reflect that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technical issues aside. My sis has been using and loving her diffuser since Christmas. She stated that it will only run for about 4 hours before running out of water. We figure this is due to the extremely dry conditions of winter.&lt;br /&gt;She really likes it, and I&#x27;m considering buying one for myself.</li>
    <li> SUPER cheap product. I ordered mine November 5, 2014 and it broke and wouldn&#x27;t even turn on February 4, 2015. It worked great until the engine started making all these funny noises, then it stopped turning on. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love my diffusers. Easy to clean. Great price.</li>
    <li> This is amazing it brought a pop of color to my kitchen</li>
    <li> I use this with my DoTerra essential oils and it works great!</li>
    <li> Great product that diffuses essential oils nicely.  I use this for my sons and daughter who frequently get croup and they loves the changing led light that it displays during diffusion.  I have had this about 6 months now.  I use it about 3-4 times a week when they are sick but then I won&#x27;t use it for 3-4 weeks until someone else gets sick.  You can use it for aroma around the house but we don&#x27;t generally.  It is silent and it shuts off automatically when the reservoir is empty.  IT was very inexpensive as compared to other diffusers.  My only complaint is that if it is left plugged in the little tiny silver disc in the middle of the reservoir can be hot and once my 4 year old took off the lid when he woke up and touched it.  He said it burned but however there was not even a red mark on him.  I did touch it myself to see how hot it was.  It was pretty hot but again I don&#x27;t think it would leave a blister or mark.  I just keep it up higher now.</li>
    <li> Good diffuser. I don&#x27;t have much experience with others but this one did the job. The light changing effect was nice and my kids enjoyed that part. I dropped it into a partially filled pan of water when trying to empty the water tank about a month after getting it and it would no longer function. User error, no fault of product makers. I will likely order again.</li>
    <li> This is my second Greenair Diffuser and it works (for the most part) as described.  I often only get 4-5 hours of continued use - but I also do not clean it as diligently and frequently as recommended.  Easy to use and love using my essential oils in it</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Was a wonderful grab bag gift I purchased</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! I have a young living defuser, but this one is just as good. Has lights that change colors and you can stop on your favorite color if you don&#x27;t want the colors to change.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and then purchased the &amp;#34;Greenair Spa Vapor + Advanced Wellness Instant Healthful Mist Therapy&amp;#34;. I gave this one 4 stars because I think the mist does not shoot up as high as the 2nd one I purchased. but I still love it, and just use it in a smaller space, our bathroom, facing our bedroom.</li>
    <li> Bought 3.  one for the office and two for our house.. love them, they work great!</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser at a very reasonable price. Buyers should be aware that first time use takes a good while to start vaporizing.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the mister...it is easy to operate, like the option to control lighting and its subtle in respect to appearance.</li>
    <li> Works well for small room</li>
    <li> First one broke after 2 uses. Company was quick to replace it and no problems with the new one.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser. It uses cool mist to disperse oils in to the air so that you can get therapeutic benefits as well as aromatic benefits from your oils. It&#x27;s great that you can choose the light settings- sometimes my daughter likes to watch the light and sometimes I need to turn it off for her to sleep. It is so wonderful that it turns itself off when it&#x27;s done so that you can use it at nighttime and not worry about falling asleep. It is very simple to use and is in the box basically ready to go. I have recommended this to family members and will continue recommending it.</li>
    <li> love this diffuser and my kids want one for their rooms. I will.definitely be buying af least 3 more for our home!</li>
    <li> Great diffuser at a good price.....</li>
    <li> This diffuser is very nice, it changes color, or you can lock a specific color in so that it doesn&#x27;t change.  It diffuses my doTerra essential oils wonderfully.  The downside.....it diffuses for only about 3 hours.  Otherwise, yes, I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I have 2 younger children and I love bring able to diffuse oils in their rooms so easily. It&#x27;s quiet and efficient. And they really enjoy the light show. Great value.</li>
    <li> I wanted something that did not burn, but still put a fragrance in the air.  This gives everything that I had wanted plus the changing color of the globe.  I love it.  It is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser!  Very nice quality - mist lasts several hours and then shuts itself off.  Ordered 2 - very pleased with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Makes my whole room and house smell amazing!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this diffuser very long and its already stopped working. It turns on and then automatically turns itself off. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it can handle every day use. I would suggest getting a different diffuser.</li>
    <li> Really like using my oils in this diffuser! ! It makes the air smell so nice and fresh!!</li>
    <li> I like it. However, it does not do as good a job as I&#x27;d hoped filling my living room with the scent.</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of essential oils and diffuse them almost every day. I have used the Greenair Spa Vapor diffuser almost daily for  six months and it works beautifully. I wanted a second diffuser for the bedroom and thought this one looked cool and as I&#x27;d had a good track record with my other Greenair diffuser decided to purchase this one. Firstly, the electric plug in is on the bottom of the diffuser which IMHO is a bad design. Secondly, the space to hold water is very shallow &#x3D; easy to spill. Thirdly, the diffuser stopped working after just three uses. Maybe I got a dud, I don&#x27;t know, but I promptly returned and will be ordering another of the Greenair Spa Vapor diffusers instead. Sadly I don&#x27;t recommend this particular diffuser. It looks cool, but has some design flaws...</li>
    <li> on the product description, clearly it is stated that the light function can be turned off. That is not true. The light freezes on a faint blue that lights up an entire room. I ordered this for help with sleeping, however, it keeps me up. Returning is listed as not an option, and I am highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use with dorerra essential oils. As long as you follow cleaning instructions you will be pleased. It will last five hours.</li>
    <li> died after using it for two weeks.  I knew there were a lot of reviews saying this may happen but I took a chance.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t, I needed this for my home massage office...</li>
    <li> This has been a great diffuser for the price!  I have had no issues and use almost daily.  I would recommend for anyone looking for a nice, simple, cheap diffuser.</li>
    <li> I used this diffuser multiple times every day and I love it.</li>
    <li> Love it &amp; I want to order some more...I like to give them to my customers as gifts.</li>
    <li> This has already broken (4 months old)</li>
    <li> Forget the hippy incense or aromathearpy- This really helps cover the smell of my dog and makes the room smell nice!  It&#x27;s a lot less expensive than all those plug ins.</li>
    <li> Works well and creates a great stream of mist. Lasts a long time, and the kids love the colored option at night.</li>
    <li> Product did not out put much mist and leaked all over.  Returned item.</li>
    <li> Awesome Oil Diffuser! Have been using it everyday without any problems.</li>
    <li> I am underwhelmed with the amount of mist that comes out of this diffuser, not to mention the fact that it doesn&#x27;t want to start when I plug it in.  The plug has to be in just right for it to work.  I am returning it.  Even though it is twice the price, I will be buying another diffuser from Young Living as the mist that comes out is like a volcano erupting instead of the trickle you get with this one.  Not impressed 😕</li>
    <li> Very nice, works great .  I am totally pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice diffuser.  It puts out a good amount of steam and lasts for quite a few hours then it shuts off.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Good product, although it definitely doesn&#x27;t diffuse for 8 hours! It&#x27;s more like 3 hours even when the water tank is filled to capacity.</li>
    <li> I received this as a birthday present. I don&#x27;t use it daily and I make sure to clean it every time I do use it. 5 months later and it won&#x27;t work. There are a couple of things I don&#x27;t like about this diffuser. 1) unless I am sitting right next to it I can&#x27;t smell anything. 2) I don&#x27;t like how it plugs into the bottom of the unit. Makes it too easy to spill the water when trying to plug it back in. 3) this is just a personal preference but I would rather have one with a intermittent timer. As far as the company goes I have read a lot of good things about them but I will have to wait and see what they are going to do about my broken diffuser before I decide if I want to purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> I purchase 2-3 diffusers a month, using them as loaners, incentives and prizes.  After months of extreme satisfaction with the Greenair Aroma Diffuser Spa Mister, I am really disappointed in the last few  that I have purchased.  Previously they all ran 6-8 hours and the last 3 have run only 2 1/2-3 hours!  Very sad :(</li>
    <li> fake picture and fake description! Does not last up to 8 hours. Only 4!!!</li>
    <li> so far so good.  Most diffusers don&#x27;t make it a year, and the best part about Greenair is their customer service. I highly recommend this company</li>
    <li> This was a great, less expensive alternative to other diffusers.  A trick I learned.... don&#x27;t follow the package instructions.  Leave a little water in it all day to help pull any oils away from the sensors vs cleaning daily.  It worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this diffuser.  It runs quietly and I plan to purchase more for other rooms in my home and for work.</li>
    <li> I use it every single day and I Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Havent had a lot of luck with the past diffusers Ive purchased, but, haven&#x27;t spent major bucks either. Bought two, same brand and products, that failed within the first two days, and one that failed in 60 days- This diffuser by Greenair has held on the longest:) I use diffusers almost around the clock, and every day. Neeeeeed a diffuser that will hold up without spending an arm and a leg!~ Happpppy so far!!!</li>
    <li> Nice diffuser. Works great.</li>
    <li> It worked fine for a few months (although I only used it maybe 10 times in that time period) and then it quit working.  It will light up but nothing comes out... piece of junk!</li>
    <li> Stays on for hours and only needs few drops of oil  love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great diffuser I have two of them.  Highly recommend them</li>
    <li> THIS DIFFUSER IS THE RIGHT SIZE TO PUT ON MY NIGHTSTAND. IF YOU ARE THINKING OF USING IT FOR A LARGE ROOM, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.  I FIND I SLEEP MUCH BETTER SINCE I HAVE USED IT.  THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO SAMPLE ALL MY ESSENTIAL OILS.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Shipped quickly from a non-Prime provider.  The mist is continuous and it does last about 4 hours.  We have a very small home and this diffuser is perfect for filling it with aromatherapeutic scent. A little sad I can&#x27;t use citrus oils in it since they&#x27;re such mood-boosters, but I have another method that would work for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Master Reiki Practitioner, this is the perfect diffuser for my practice space - I like that there are options for the colored light, I tend to keep it green for a healing vibe.</li>
    <li> Works great and the price is affordable.</li>
    <li> After 4 months of weekly use, this started sputtering when first turned on.  It will eventually go quiet, but it will take a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, something I have noticed is that the unit heats up extremely warm, almost hot, and therefore heats up the essential oils.  I don&#x27;t smell the oils after about an hour of use, because they are too hot and likely have evaporated. (Just my opinion.)  Disappointed about the two above reasons, BUT it was a great little machine for the first few months.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. This broke after I used it less than 10 times but since its past 30 days i&#x27;m stuck with it with no refund, no replacement nothing. Don&#x27;t buy this item.  Update. I contacted the manufacturer who sent me a replacement.  They were very nice and got one right out.  However,  after just a few uses of the replacement it stopped working as well. I bought a $19 diffuser from a well known retaile, it even came with two oils and it&#x27;s worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely  love this diffuser its easy to fill and clean runs for 8 hours and is kid proof! Its perfect.</li>
    <li> Giving as a Christmas gift</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Works great! Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This arrived in a very timely manner. Is exactly what it was represented to be.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and works as it should. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Sent it back. The first 2 settings shut off quickly,  the last setting runs forever and the water heated to boiling. Amazon was great at getting me a refund.</li>
    <li> Pros: Arrived Quick, was exactly as described&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Only diffused for 3 hours, lights are annoying. We purchased this item in June and its only September and the diffuser already doesn&#x27;t work. We cleaned exactly as it recommended but no mist. Now needing to purchase another and this item definitely won&#x27;t be it especially because it&#x27;s only a month return policy.</li>
    <li> Great diffuser. Works great and looks cool. It will shut off when out of water which is good, but I only wish the water tank was a bit bigger so I didn&#x27;t have to fill it so frequently.</li>
    <li> This item never even turned on and for whatever reason I am not able to return it. I would not hVe bought it if I knew it was non- returnable. Do no buy!!!,</li>
    <li> The diffuser leaks and you cannot smell the vapors.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this diffuser. It creates heavy mist that leaves a puddle on the surface it sits on.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and my 8 year old loves it!</li>
    <li> It works just like advertised.</li>
    <li> This is awesome!  It works wonderfully with my essential oils.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The diffuser does not work i had to contact green air directly they sent me a replacement base but not top so i had to use the top from the one I purchased on Amazon and they want me to return it which I cannot do since I was only sent a partial replacement from Green Air</li>
    <li> This seemed to be a great diffuser. Shape is fine, lights can be adjusted how you want it, it&#x27;s quite silent, it seems like it&#x27;s got it all. But!!! It stopped working. I bought five and all of them are bad. :(</li>
    <li> This diffuser only worked for a couple of weeks, then quit. I bought it for my daughter as a Christmas gift and am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s an oil diffuser but when I purchased it, it said it was an 8 hour diffuser and I got a 4 hour diffuser. Should have paid attention to the box before I used it. The only thing I like about this is the oils the diffuser is worthless when it shuts off 4 hours into your sleep time.</li>
    <li> Item was received fast. Vey good quality</li>
    <li> I bought this diffuser about a month ago and&lt;br /&gt;1.it stopped working out of the blue..doesn&#x27;t even turn on&lt;br /&gt;2.lasted only 4hrs max....when it was working&lt;br /&gt;3.PRO-it did cover a large area(ive got tall ceilings)&lt;br /&gt;4.maintenance was simple..</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!  I use it everyday, sometimes for several hours, and even with the high demand, it handles everything like a champ.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love Diffuser, it has a soft gentle mist.</li>
    <li> 3 stars because we LOVE this humidifier.  It just stopped working after about 2 months of use.  :(  I have not reported it yet, but if I can give an update, I will post it on here.</li>
    <li> We bought this almost 3 months ago (and read &amp; followed the instructions). I&#x27;ll give it one star for how cool it looks at night. Unfortunately, it was leaking after about a week of use. I finally got tired of cleaning up the large puddle of water this left after every use. I threw it in the trash today.</li>
    <li> Works very well, use almost daily. Silent and emits quite a bit of humidity. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Im sure as a run-of-the-mill diffuser, it is fine. However, I read the instructions and we could not use citrus oils in it! Well, that was one of the main oils I wanted to diffuse so this was not the diffuser for me. I never used the product. 3 stars because I feel it would limit what oils to diffuse. But, I had no issues returning the item so that was definitely worth 5 stars! :)</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works great!!!  I love that this one holds more water than my other diffusers.  Definitely would recommend this to my friends and family!!!</li>
    <li> My first diffuser, works fine but NOT EVEN CLOSE to 8 hours...maybe 3.</li>
    <li> Simple and elegant design. I have used mine for two weeks. No issues; works as advertised. I am considering to give  as a gift.</li>
    <li> Works great, even in our large living room.</li>
    <li> I noticed a puddle of water under this when I used it the first time but thought perhaps it was due to the vapor falling and collecting under the unit.  After 3 uses this completely stopped working, would not even turn on, no lights, nothing.  I picked it up and there was a huge pool of water under it and water leaking from the underside of the unit.  I am now shopping for a replacement but it won&#x27;t be this brand!</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 of these. After 2 months one is dead. Stopped working. The light feature is super cool for the kids rooms where I used them. A shame they gave out so quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a very simple and effective diffuser.  No complicated parts to break down, and the lights are nice and soft.</li>
    <li> MY GIRLS LOVE IT AND IT WORKS GOOD.</li>
    <li> Works well and is attractive on the counter</li>
    <li> Great Item. Have had it for 7 months and works great.  Works just as well as the really expensive ones, which I&#x27;ve also purchased and use.</li>
    <li> I had a fruit fly problem and I read that they don&#x27;t like peppermint.  So I use this diffuser for about 2 weeks straight.  I cleaned it with vinegar after every use as the instructions indicated.  I definitely preferred this over candles since they also put wax type stuff in the air.</li>
    <li> Normally I am very pleased with this diffuser but occasionally it will run a little loud and if you smack it it quiets down. I think there is something wrong with the motor causing this. Wish it wasn&#x27;t the case but with the great deal I got in this day and age I guess it&#x27;s to be expected. I will probably still look at getting another.</li>
    <li> this was recommended to me by a friend, works great, easy to use and pretty with the changing colors.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this! I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months now and just ordered a second for downstairs. We use it just about 24/7.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best essential oil diffuser I&#x27;ve used, having tried 4 different diffusers over the last couple of years, with various price ranges. The oils are dispensed throughout the room very quickly. The mist actually goes into the air and the diffuser runs the entire time it claims 4-6 hours.  You can smell the oils through out the entire time the diffuser is running. I will definitely recommend this to family and friends.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is easy to use. I bought this for my dad and he loves it. I had a question about it and called customer service and they were very helpful. The automatic shut off is a great feature. I will probable order another one very soon.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. It has been quite reliable and is easy to clean. Easily beats out the pricier models it replaced.</li>
    <li> Works as described. While you can turn off the lights, there is still a bright blue light on the on/off button that stays on. Makes it hard for me to fall asleep (unless I wear an eye mask). Otherwise, it does the job well.</li>
    <li> amazing!  We love them.  One in every room.  I got 3 in 2014.  Still using them.  I drip essential oil in, clean often w/ a toothpick and a run w/ white vinegar.  House smells lovely and in the winter, not as dry.  When I cleaned them, a small, round disc snapped off the mechanism in the cone.  Oops!  Now they run even longer, stronger.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a diffuser.  So far it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy diffusing essential oils in this diffuser. I&#x27;ve used it nearly every day since receiving it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with all the things I  Bought so far from amazon. Really good quality always on time. They have the best price compare to all the big expensive stores out there.</li>
    <li> Died after 2 weeks of having it. Card got really hot and it started making a loud noise</li>
    <li> Wonderful purchase. Very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> This product was advertised to run between 6-8 hours.  The item description on amazon said 6 hours, and the photo shows a description on the box that says 8 hours or run time, but when i received the product the box and instructions said 4 hours.  It also doesn&#x27;t run with the light off all the way.  You can turn the main light off, but there is a light on the on/off button that remains on, and it is surprisingly bright if it is in a completely dark room.  The only reason I did not send this item back is because it is very quiet when running, and and I liked that about it.  I&#x27;ll probably purchase something different when this one dies.</li>
    <li> I have purchased three of these so far. Great diffuser with relaxing color changing lights.</li>
    <li> After 1 day of use it leaked all over the table. NOT happy! Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!!!  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it puts out quite a bit of mist, sometimes not much at all.  Works well but found another brand I like better that also works more like a humidifier.</li>
    <li> Saw one in a local health food store for $44.  Then saw this one on Amazon for $33.00 (different brand).  Add $6 shipping, I&#x27;m still ahead $5.00!  Wow.  Then it stopped working after two days.  Had to send it back, but won&#x27;t get my $6 shipping cost back, then have to go to the local health food store and spend the $44, plus tax.  This whole thing didn&#x27;t go according to plan, but I still want one.  I like the way it gently adds fragrance to the air.  It makes a pretty cool night-light too.</li>
    <li> I have tried at least 3 other kinds of diffusers, and sent them all back! We now have 3 of these, and I recommend them to everyone :)</li>
    <li> Great product with fast shipping.  Love to mix the essential oils.  Lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> This little diffuser is very cute and it works GREAT for the size and price! I suggest unplugging it when not in use, as it continues to vibrate when powered off and will still put a little mist into the air. It also makes a high pitched buzz when powered off and left plugged in. Other than that minor issue it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Works wonderful. So we&#x27;ll that I&#x27;m going to order 2 more of them.</li>
    <li> It stopped working. Will never buy again. I&#x27;m going to stick with Zaq because the discs can be replaced. I&#x27;ve only had the diffuser for a couple of months and cleaned it regularly. It just stopped working, lights and all. What a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Noisy and bigger than expected</li>
    <li> Great product but must be set level to work. Tried to sit on towel &amp; it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Great service and product</li>
    <li> received timely and in good condition.  Releases a fine rising steam of the ingredients I added to the well of essential oil and water. You need to be directly above/near the unit to enjoy the fumes.  It is more like a personal unit than a room unit. But I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple weeks now it works great so far. Love it for the price especially</li>
    <li> These cone type oil diffusers are all about the same. None are outstanding or last very long. If you use this type then buy plenty and clean twice a day with white vinegar. They&#x27;ll last a bit longer that way. Absolutely DO NOT overfill. Messes up the sensor big time!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. It never worked properly, and started shorting out after using it for a week and cleaning it once.</li>
    <li> Love that it works instantly. It does have a slight humming noise as it works.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I want to buy another one for my bedroom.</li>
    <li> Awful product and cheap material.  One touch on button doesn&#x27;t work after SEVERAL tries to get it to work.</li>
    <li> I love this more than candles. Its safer in my home for pets and children.</li>
    <li> I have two and keep repurchasing for friends who come over and want one!</li>
    <li> Only the 2nd diffuser I&#x27;ve purchased after the first one broke ($79 from Young Living). Completely happy with this one and plan to purchase more for my kids&#x27; rooms and other rooms in the house.</li>
    <li> I received the diffuser and I like it. However, it does not run the 8 hours it states. Also, even after you turn off the lights, it is still VERY bright blue. If you like to sleep with it dark, this is not for you. It works great in a small room.</li>
    <li> I really, really, really love this, but the first setting stopped working about 6 mos in. Still works on the second setting but the colour changing one stops after 1 colour now and the water just sits in there. Darn! UPDATE: doesn&#x27;t last a year! All this unit has done is sit on a table, no wear and tear, has never been dropped, has never even been touched by anyone other than me. Went to use tonight and the power button fell off and inside the unit. So, I guess it&#x27;s truly trash now. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works great asing as you put warm water&lt;br /&gt;In it, not too warm and not too cold. Otherwise it takes it a few minutes to really start working good. Other than that it works great and my kids love the colors!</li>
    <li> I used it once and it worked great. The next night it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
    <li> We love this product so much! We use it everyday with oils and they do a good job. I love how it lasts four hours.</li>
    <li> Love our new diffuser.  We have had it for over a month and use it every night before bed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my Greenair Aroma Diffuser.  It runs for a very long time diffusing different essential oils.  I have not had any problems with it at all.  I will be purchasing more for other rooms in the house--great buy!!</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use, works great.  Pretty portable too, as I got this for my labor room - filled the hospital room with nice, relaxing smells and was easy to move when we changed rooms.  Using it at home, and the eucalyptus oil is great for winter stuffy noses.  Used with cool mist humidifier across the room and everyone was breathing better. The only con is the small amount of water that it holds and that the top does not secure on.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it runs all night and there&#x27;s still a full tank of water in the am. Can also be a little noisy at times.  Otherwise, disperses essential oil sent wonderfully. Love the vapor mist and color changing to soothe me to sleep.</li>
    <li> had for over a year and it still works really well</li>
    <li> I purchased this 3 weeks ago. It seemed fine, sputtered a bit, but was a good little machine. I was prepared to purchase another and bam, the darn thing stopped working. I&#x27;ve asked the seller for troubleshooting ideas since it&#x27;s not eligible for return. I would take another, I&#x27;d rather have a working diffuser than my money back, I&#x27;ve not been given that option...just bam... Disappointed since my daughter just started selling doTerra... I&#x27;ll wait...ordered. Different one....be careful when purchasing this particular model.</li>
    <li> Great little diffuser! I&#x27;ve had it for a year now, I use it almost every day, and it&#x27;s still going strong. It runs for 6-8 hours and it is very quiet. The changing lights are pretty too.  It doesn&#x27;t fill my living room with scent, but I&#x27;m yet to find a diffuser that will, I have a very large open floor plan. In the bedrooms it works quite nicely.  I just wish the lights were a bit more dimmable and that it had a timer. But overall I&#x27;m very happy with this, specially for the price.</li>
    <li> very happy, is quiet, love the auto shut off. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> We are very satisfied with Greenair Aroma Diffuser!  Meet all expectations!! Would Purchase Again!! Already Purchased 3 for throughout the house!!</li>
    <li> Just purchased this in December and have used it maybe a dozen time and now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Very disappointed to only get a few months use out of it. :(</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, however does not work. Waiting for replacement that is &amp;#34;back ordered&amp;#34;.!! Green-Air has my money, I have NOTHING.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Product is as described. Runs quietly. Diffuses the oils well. The changing colors are so fun. Would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Didn&#x27;t last very long. Got noisy and then made the water &amp;#34;super hot&#x27;. Poor quality.</li>
    <li> Works great, even in a large room.  This has been used at least daily for almost 3 months now and no problems so far.  It typically runs for about 5 hours at a time.  Will definitely consider purchasing another in the future!</li>
    <li> I loved using this diffuser for about 2 months and then it just stopped working.  Right when I was planning to use it in the bedroom of my sick child, it decided to die for no reason.  I always did everything according to the directions.  It was really disappointing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this diffuser.  I bought it because of the price, but it might be better to spend the extra money on the next one.  There is a customer service number on the bottom of it so I plan to call it to see if they&#x27;ll replace it.</li>
    <li> I use this every day in my office and it works great! I run it all day and I only have to fill it up 1-3 times. One drawback is that there&#x27;s no setting for output so if you want to crank it up and cover a larger area or turn it down if it&#x27;s too strong you&#x27;re out of luck. Other than that I think this thing is great</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser! Can&#x27;t wait to get more!</li>
    <li> Loved it until...it just quit after a month.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again as I have thrown the box away and not worth sending back.</li>
    <li> Best diffuser.  Works great</li>
    <li> Works great - no issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This diffuser does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  I was pleasantly surprised to have instant mist upon filling and turning the unit on.  I highly recommend the Greenair Aroma Diffuser.</li>
    <li> The diffuser worked great for the last 4 months, although I did notice the adapter was getting extremely hot.  We had it recently plugged into the bathroom outlet and this morning I found that the breaker tripped (initially it was not obvious which breaker went to the outlet as the \\&quot;master bath\\&quot; breaker was not tripped, so initially I thought it somehow broke the outlet) and there was a blackish smoke stain on the outlet panel and the wall around the outlet where it had been plugged in.  So, not only is our diffuser without a plug now, I&#x27;m a little upset that it burned our wall.  As a diffuser though, great job.  Not so happy about the fire hazard.    Edited to mention, I also noticed some minor mold growth in the cone top that was difficult to reach to clean.  I managed to get it clean but it&#x27;s just something to pay attention to since it was up inside the cone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother after receiving the same one for Christmas. It is simple to use &amp; fills a medium sized room with aroma. I&#x27;ve been very happy with this diffuser. No problems so far.</li>
    <li> Very enjoyable.  Quite durable</li>
    <li> For all the good reviews out there, I&#x27;m surprised there aren&#x27;t more negative ones for this product. Upon first use, I poured in water and precious drops of my expensive essential oil, only to have the unit short out and never fully turn on. Even 24 hours after letting it &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; there was no progress. I quickly returned this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s also important to note that this unit looks to be identical to the one sold by NOW (which has tons of negative reviews expressing my same situation).</li>
    <li> What a disappointment.  I bought this for my son&#x27;s room- the light show made a great nightlight.  But, back it went the next day.  It literally broke the first night we used it.</li>
    <li> I really love this diffuser! It changes colors and is great for diffusing oils! I would definitely recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> it broke and I cant return it, it broke within 2 months of LIGHT use. are you kidding me? the steam won come out at all, and its being used correctly .</li>
    <li> Got this for my son &amp; it&#x27;s one of the coolest things ever! The lights change colors and he absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s new to diffusing oils and is loving combining the different scents. You cannot use any citrus in this unit however and it only lasts about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a great purchase or a great gift for someone!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too temperamental. Just an accidental splash of water on the side and it quits working. No one has time to turn it upside down for a 24 hour period to dry it out. It also never completely shuts off. I have to remember to unplug it from the wall every time I&#x27;m done using it.</li>
    <li> Great diffuser. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This diffuser claims to cover 250 feet. I have seen plenty of diffusers that actually cover 250 feet. This one cannot even handle a 50 square feet room. I can&#x27;t even smell it 2 feet away. My diffuser that claims to be for 50 feet actually works better and farther than this one. I will be returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the lights are pretty, but if I wanted a $30 nightlight, I could do better than this.</li>
    <li> Did. Ot work right out of the box brand new</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser! The only thing I would change about it is I wish the off setting for the light was truly off not a dim blue glow. It works great for my bedroom that is about 200 feet.</li>
    <li> Works great, use it every night!</li>
    <li> This is working great..really like it.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one of these.  From the beginning, it would not turn off all the way, but would make little bubbles in the off mode.  Now it doesn&#x27;t make hardly any mist and I am less than a month past my &#x27;can&#x27;t return&#x27; period.  Sad disappointment.</li>
    <li> Yesterday, I would have given this diffuser 5 stars. Today, it gets 2. This is my 2nd Greenair diffuser. I ordered this one last week because I had been so happy the first one - had been. This morning as I opened the box of this new diffuser, I realized that the original greenair diffuser was no longer operating. It worked fine last night. Not working at all today. I&#x27;ve used it for less than 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;d like a short-term diffuser, this is the one for you. Its not for me. I wanted this one as an addition to the other. Its now a substitute. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars b/c for the time it worked, it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - as per the nice comment left by Greenair folks, I thought I should probably read thru the instructions before calling them to be sure I&#x27;d not done something wrong. Well, I had. The night before the unit quit working, it&#x27;d gotten knocked over. The very helpful manual notes that this could cause a problem and how to rectify that problem. I did as instructed and guess what. The unit is now working perfectly. I&#x27;m changing my rating to 5 stars b/c I love both of my diffusers. They&#x27;re quiet, soothing, and a good price. Thanks Greenair!</li>
    <li> easy to use. attractive on bedside.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Great product &amp; great service !</li>
    <li> This diffuser worked well for a few weeks and then began not turning off completely. The &amp;#34;automatic&amp;#34; shut off when the water tank emptied malfunctioned and the small metal plate in the bottom of the tank continued to heat. It must have burned out because after not using it for a few weeks I tried to diffuse last night in a sick child&#x27;s room and it would not turn on. Very disappointed that I missed the return window.</li>
    <li> Just received my package. I was hesitant to order because of all of the reviews stating the short life of the diffuser and after having just sent back my last one after only working for 30 minutes, I open this package to a clearly USED diffuser. I can see residue from water/EO in the base. I have not used it yet, but 2 stars off the bat for a deceptive sale on a product with a reputation of only working for a short time. Would not have ordered if I new I was getting refurbished.</li>
    <li> Like the other products from Greenair, this one did not disappoint! The Greenair Aromamister is the perfect size, can run for up to 8 hours, has 6 color LED light changing capability. Though I have read some negative feedback on this model on Amazon, I did not experience any problems, in fact this diffuser has worked fabulously! We are using the Aromamister in my 10 year old daughters room and she absolutely loves the light color changing capability and we have found it VERY helpful for her health conditions, including Asthma. I feel that the oils are not compromised in any way and are diffused well throughout the room. We not only use this as prevention against asthma attacks, but also as treatment, and it works very well, not to mention quickly. ( Please do not take my word for it, do your OWN research ) I truly do recommend this model! I think the Aromamister is perfect for a child’s room, though is an adequate diffuser for anyone and would make a GREAT Christmas gift for just about anyone on your Christmas list! Even yourself ;) Imagine diffusing some amazing Christmas blends throughout your home or office!</li>
    <li> Works great for our general needs and is super easy to use. The price makes this a great value.</li>
    <li> Really  like this. Bought two. One leaked. Called Greenair. They were very nice. Sent replacement very quick. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Broke in less than a month.... don&#x27;t waste your money!! And they only take returns in first 30 days... so sad.</li>
    <li> After two weeks of using this diffuser I loved it so much I purchase a second one. Now on week threw the motor is SO LOUD!! I&#x27;m hummed we wasted the money on these. We do use it nightly, but we follow the maintenance guidelines. There&#x27;s no reason it should be noisier than a small box fan.</li>
    <li> This is my third diffuser and I love it.  My ONLY issue is when the light is OFF, it should be dark, not softly lit.  Nice and quiet and makes the air feel and smell great.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these March 13th and got a few days later. One has already broke. It started out by making a loud noise when it first turned on the last two times and then it would go away and get quiet again. When I went back into my babies room only an hour later it was completely dead. I tried to plug it in the next day and the lights flickered like it was trying to work but then died completely. The other one I have at work has been working okay so far but it still frustrates me that the one for home died!!!!!!! Perhaps there is a reason its so cheap. OH ya.. and I called the customer service number on the bottom of the product and it took me to some vacation promotion answering system so that really pissed me off. Amazon, however has good customer service and made it right. I wont order again.</li>
    <li> The Greenair Aroma Diffuser, Spa Mister works beautifully.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month.  The lights, mist and automatically shut off is exactly as described.  The actual misting time lasts longer than 4 hours.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I gave it only four stars because I did not get one for free in exchange for a review, LOL,. and it&#x27;s supposed to go 4-8 hours before stopping and mine only goes about 3 hours.  Still, that&#x27;s a pretty minor thing.  While it&#x27;s going it&#x27;s wonderful and I can&#x27;t believe how this little thing fills the room with scent! It&#x27;s very robust all over the room.  I put a couple extra drops of some of the oils in--the instructions say 5-6 drops, but I think it depends on the quality and grade of oil you are using.  I tend to buy the cheaper stuff and it isn&#x27;t quite as potent sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.  And I may buy another because I&#x27;m sick of carrying it around.  Upstairs at night for bed, back downstairs int eh morning, but I usually forget, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nutritionist has a store and he sells this unit--possibly another brand but it looks identical--for $45.00.  I got this for $27 and free shipping with my prime account.  Good deal.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the wonderful smell our room has after every use.</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it everyday, all day!</li>
    <li> I have had this for several months now and it worked great for the first month. After that it had some glitches. It was a cheaper one on the market and at the time I didn&#x27;t have $ for a better quality one. I chose to try it out and see. I use only distilled water. I have it run most of the day and probably 5 days out of the week. It held up for some time. I can still get it to work after messing with it for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I have had the more expensive ones and I would say that they both work just fine. This one will die faster but I think end up paying the same if not a little less by buying the cheaper ones more frequently. My $100 one lasted me 2 years. And this one technicaly still works and I have had it for 5+ months (I paid $19). So it is up to you if you want to buy more often or less often.</li>
    <li> This mister didn&#x27;t put the mist out very well. Bottom leaked.</li>
    <li> Same as the Now diffuser but cheaper. This diffuser is great!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Works great! About 4+ hours then it shuts itself off. Use it with my iScentU 100% therapeutic essential oils. Wonderful! Will probably purchase another one for work.</li>
    <li> Love it! Easy water fill, clean up and use your favorite oils. Long lasting mist! I got everything that was promised!</li>
    <li> I really liked this diffuser and it worked well for me the first few uses. It filled a good size room when diffusing oils. However, after one short month of use it turns off frequently and I have to keep turning it back on until the water runs out. The first few times it ran until the water ran out, now I&#x27;m lucky if it runs for a solid hour. :( Bummed because I did like this diffuser for the price and was going to buy more!</li>
    <li> This is a good diffuser for a small room or office. I had intended it for my master bedroom, but I guess it just doesn&#x27;t have the power to disperse the particles in a larger room. I can&#x27;t even smell a hint of the essential oils from the diffuser in my bedroom. I have the same diffuser in my son&#x27;s smaller bedroom and it works great.&lt;br /&gt; My main complaint about this diffuser is that the light is SO BRIGHT. Even when you turn off the light option, the power button is a bright electric blue that gives off a bright glow emitting through the top of the cone. I am a sensitive sleeper and this really causes me to lose sleep! I can no longer use this in my bedroom, however it is great for my son&#x27;s room as it doubles as a night light for him. I wish I had only purchased one, as now I cannot return the second one that will be sitting unused.</li>
    <li> Love them, just wish the stayed on longer than four hours.</li>
    <li> I purchased this diffuser. It worked great for a week. Then died. I called greenair who no questions sent a new one staying there was something wrong with a batch of the diffusers. Well I received the replacement two weeks later and after a week it died. Not sure what&#x27;s going on. Definitely will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Gift for Secret Santa. Came with good package.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a part of a Christmas gift for my future sister in-law. She says it has helped tremendously with her sinuses and seasonal allergies. Along with this I also purchased her the Aromatherapy Top 6 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Basic Sampler Essential Oils from Amazon</li>
    <li> Good for a change in aroma department</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Jan 12th, and the Diffuser has started making noises on startup (like a bearing or something is about to give...the way a fan will sound before it quits).  After it gets going it makes a constant light noise.  It still works, it&#x27;s just in the beginning processes of failing.  As with all my reviews, there will be updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;So, looking over my reviews I came upon this one.  It&#x27;s now December 15th (about a year after the purchase) and we ended up throwing this thing in the trash.  Not too long after it started making noises and intermittently working, it stopped working all together.  So in short...lasted about 4 months.  So tired of things being so cheaply made.  It earned the one star rating.</li>
    <li> great little diffuser and it takes tap water instead of distilled</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser. It puts moisture back in the air and smells wonderful too.  I use a lavender oil in mine.</li>
    <li> Works awesome. I might buy another so I won&#x27;t have to move from the living room to my bedroom all the time.</li>
    <li> Works just fine, DSidn&#x27;t know it would light up with different colors, kind of a nice thing I guess. This is my first one so I really am not sure what to expect still learning about what this doews</li>
    <li> We have been through a few cheaper diffusers so I&#x27;m skeptical of anything in this price range, but what made me choose this over so many others is that almost every negative review I saw was followed up by the company offering to make it right, so I bought with peace of mind that if something went wrong, I&#x27;d be covered. I love that you can either rotate colors or have it fixed on one, and it gives a good mist for its size and capacity. We use it in my daughter&#x27;s bedroom and I can smell it down the hallway. It lasts pretty well, I would say their estimate is about right. Overall you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> I have ordered 4 of these and 3 broke in the first 2 months.  I can not return or replace them because of the time frame.  I do not recommend this brand at all!  Total waist of money!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when this came in the mail that I opened up the box to use it right away. I made sure to follow the instructions and at first everything went just fine. Then later in the evening when I had put it in my son&#x27;s room I noticed that the table I had set it on was soaked. Thinking it was just a fluke and that maybe I knocked some water over I brought it out to the kitchen to use it in the morning and same thing happened. I&#x27;m going to return it. the diffuser isn&#x27;t supposed to get everything wet like a humidifier does and I was bummed that it didn&#x27;t hold very much water and could only be ran for maybe two hours and then it needs to be refilled. Also it doesn&#x27;t have an auto on and off switch you have to manually do it so it&#x27;s not one to use for the night time. The changing colors is fun and with the steam coming out of the top it looks like a volcano which my 4yr. Old and husband thought was pretty cool.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality.  Returned this item.  Should have known by the price.  Did not diffuse steadily and was very damp.  Had to set in a place that water would not bother the cabinet.  Wanted for my bedroom so that didn&#x27;t work well on wood furniture.</li>
</ol>
