      <li>This exfoliating scrubber is very useful and definitely easy to use.</li>
      <li>It This set comes with a smaller sponge that is great for your face.</li>
      <li>of the cheap exfoliators or scrubs that I have purchase in Walmart</li>
      <li>Good quality of materials and so soft.</li>
      <li>Good quality and easy handle for cleaning my back!</li>
      <li>I read somewhere that exfoliating your entire body stimulates circulation, so it not only feels great but is good for you too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used an exfoliator made from hemp - and I am so enjoying it.</li>
      <li>Purchased as a gift, it was a huge success.</li>
      <li>I really like this even better than a loofah.</li>
      <li>It is really cool.</li>
      <li>if I were to make a suggestion, make the scrubby parts a bit more coarse so it can exfoliate better.</li>
      <li>The small pad is great for my face, but my favorite is the large pad with handles.</li>
      <li>The packaging is pretty for gift giving!</li>
      <li>It does a good job exfoliating yet not too rough on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, everything is good.</li>
      <li>great and high quality product, love that it is made from all natural sources, the dark part is made of cotton and the exfoliating pad is made of hemp which i understand it is antibacterial, mildew resistant and biodegradable.</li>
      <li>face scrubber is also very gentle, it gave me the right exfoliation that I</li>
      <li>Wish it wasn&#x27;t black, good quality though</li>
      <li>so it makes exfoliating your back very easy - much easier than a brush.</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time today and I have to say that my favorite part of the kit is the back scrubber.</li>
      <li>The long body scrubber is a great length for getting around your back and neck.</li>
      <li>I am raising my review because JC World Enterprises sent me another Scrubber to replace the one that the handle broke on first using it.</li>
      <li>Used it the first night I got it.</li>
      <li>When I heard that, my first thought was this is probably one of those companies.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great texture that&#x27;s gentle enough for face, neck and chest, but also strong enough to exfoliate the back.  </li>
      <li>but the scrubby parts could be a bit more scrubby, but I cant complain much because it does get my back, and I also use to get my legs, calves and stuff as well.</li>
      <li>Does a great job on the back, just wish it was a little longer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on your skin.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast too</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a bit more rough.</li>
      <li>I know I have been too rough on the strings, but I would have thought after that many reviews</li>
      <li>So much easier to use than a brush.  </li>
      <li>These two products are okay but wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
      <li>Amazing quality scrubbers that are made of natural hemp.&lt;br /&gt;By default, we do not need extreme exfoliation as our skin may become irritated and</li>
      <li>It is made in a way that you can actually clean your back.</li>
      <li>Decent exfoliant set.</li>
      <li>I have never been able to find something that actually helps me reach my back.</li>
      <li>i end up feeling it tear a little more</li>
      <li>I have gone through so many in my time and they just don&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>I also found that the hemp dries faster use much faster than others I have used... which makes me think it will last that much longer!</li>
      <li>Definitely a product worth keeping.</li>
      <li>Perfect to get your back and other hard ot reach places in the shower.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t overly rough and scratchy like some other loofah-type scrubbers I have tried; this one leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are really gentle to the skin and the back scrubber reaches all the parts that a normal sponge cant.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is softer than a Loofa yet still firm enough to give a very smooth polished feel after use.  </li>
      <li>All of the dead skin is removed for a smooth and natural glow.  </li>
      <li>Always on the look out for natural hemp products.</li>
      <li>So much easier to access all areas of the back without yoga moves to get the brush to the area!  </li>
      <li>Makes my skin so soft.</li>
      <li>They felt similar to a washcloth and, therefore, I felt like there wasn&#x27;t really an exfoliating aspect to it.</li>
      <li>The exfoliating pad on it is just the right roughness (not too rough and not too soft).</li>
      <li>This has been a great exfoliator but not abrasive or irritating as other products I have tried.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this(yesterday), I thought this was finally the answer to my neglected back.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this body scrubber set as a gift.  I have been using it for about a week and I love it.  The long body scrubber is a great length for getting around your back and neck. The exfoliating pad on it is just the right roughness (not too rough and not too soft). I read somewhere that exfoliating your entire body stimulates circulation, so it not only feels great but is good for you too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set rinses well, dries quickly and keeps it shape nicely.  Also love the bonus face pad.  I now use it every morning and evening in my face care routine.</li>
    <li> Good quality of materials and so soft. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I received this set as a gift and really like the size and the small round bonus scrub pad which has an elastic band on the back to easily slip your fingers through for ease while using. The hemp terry cloth is a great exfoliator without being as abrasive as loofa and both pieces have soft foam padding as well. The packaging is pretty for gift giving!</li>
    <li> I am raising my review because JC World Enterprises sent me another Scrubber to replace the one that the handle broke on first using it. I am happy to try the scrubber again as I loved the feel of it. Hopefully this one will last. I will try it our over the next 30 days and  If it does last I will raise my review to a five star.</li>
    <li> Saw a video of this product.  I was looking for a natural material exfoliating tool for my back.  Came to Amazon through the video.  I love this product.  It has a small scrubber for the face and a long handled scrubber for my back.  It is the perfect length and I love the roughness of the exfoliating surface.  It is abrasive without being too scratchy.  So much easier to use than a brush.  So much easier to access all areas of the back without yoga moves to get the brush to the area!  The facial one is small and easily manipulated.  I will use it too although my main reason for buying was for the back scrubber.  I would recommend this product if you are needing exfoliating and who doesn&#x27;t!!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, it was a huge success. The person using it loves it!</li>
    <li> Like the material, using it for about a week now, I can see the difference on the face. The material is not too hard on the face or body. The body one may be a little too long for an average women. Other than that, everything is good.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today and I have to say that my favorite part of the kit is the back scrubber. It is made in a way that you can actually clean your back. I have never been able to find something that actually helps me reach my back. I just love it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Makes my skin so soft. They even sent me an email after shipping with tips on how to use and care for their product. Great company, dreamt product!</li>
    <li> I am on the bigger side and washing my back has always been difficult. Thought I would try this, the reviews looked great. So far so good, strong handles, scrubs nicely, the face one, is actually really nice to have on hand, never had one before, so it&#x27;s a great bonus.</li>
    <li> Love it great quality</li>
    <li> love this... not abrasive as it should be but great for exfoliating</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a bit more rough. not a fan</li>
    <li> These two products are okay but wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I thought they&#x27;d be a little more &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; and not so flimsy once wet. the  They felt similar to a washcloth and, therefore, I felt like there wasn&#x27;t really an exfoliating aspect to it.</li>
    <li> I was asked to write a review for this product. At first, I was confused as to exactly what I was reviewing? Just kidding! I don&#x27;t like a bath brush. The bristles of the brush are usually too abrasive. My wittle back is tender! So I opted to try out this product. It is really cool. It has two handles so it makes exfoliating your back very easy - much easier than a brush. It This set comes with a smaller sponge that is great for your face. It is made from the same fabric. I really like this even better than a loofah. A+</li>
    <li> Just what i needed to scrub my back.</li>
    <li> Shorter than it looks in the picture.  It&#x27;s about the length of a hand towel.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this(yesterday), I thought this was finally the answer to my neglected back.  But after using it just a couple of minutes ago, I broke a string. I&#x27;m heartbroken,  but what can I do?  Maybe sow it back?  I would still recommend this to women.  I know I have been too rough on the strings, but I would have thought after that many reviews, someone may have gotten the company on it (hello, product devt😉).  Sigh💔</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my hemp scrubber set! I like it because at first did not seem rough enough but with the uses I can feel a difference in my skin! Smooth and glowing! I LOVE the face Scrubber for the size and it is easy to wash!</li>
    <li> Does a great job on the back, just wish it was a little longer.</li>
    <li> Wish I had this product over last 70 years. Delightful to use.</li>
    <li> This item hits the mark for me. It is ergonomically perfect for back scrubbing &amp; the face pad is so smooth. I love,love,love it.</li>
    <li> Worthless, threw it away! I bought it because of all the great ratings. Then I heard that companies are paying people to write great reviews. When I heard that, my first thought was this is probably one of those companies. A washcloth works as well as this for exfoliating!</li>
    <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t black, good quality though</li>
    <li> Good product , I would buy it again</li>
    <li> everytime i try and use it on my back i end up feeling it tear a little more</li>
    <li> Always on the look out for natural hemp products. This has been a great exfoliator but not abrasive or irritating as other products I have tried. The small pad is great for my face, but my favorite is the large pad with handles. Great for the hard to reach back, no more back acne!</li>
    <li> Beautiful product - This is a wonderful exfoliator and it has a very stylish look, great to give as a gift.  The texture of the scrubbers is better than anything that i have used before.  It is softer than a Loofa yet still firm enough to give a very smooth polished feel after use.  Also, the fact that this fiber does not collect bacteria is another reason that I love it!  I definitely recommend BodyVines to anyone who is looking for a natural exfoliation product.</li>
    <li> Love this scrubber set!  It&#x27;s a great texture that&#x27;s gentle enough for face, neck and chest, but also strong enough to exfoliate the back.  It isn&#x27;t overly rough and scratchy like some other loofah-type scrubbers I have tried; this one leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Used it the first night I got it. It exfoliated my face a back of my legs and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Definitely a product worth keeping.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality scrubbers that are made of natural hemp.&lt;br /&gt;By default, we do not need extreme exfoliation as our skin may become irritated and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the cheap exfoliators or scrubs that I have purchase in Walmart did nothing good in my skin,&lt;br /&gt;all along I have this mindset that all scrubbers were created equally.&lt;br /&gt;But no, not until I got myself these scrubbers.&lt;br /&gt;They are really gentle to the skin and the back scrubber reaches all the parts that a normal sponge cant.&lt;br /&gt;The face scrubber is also very gentle, it gave me the right exfoliation that I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning and storing is very easy, I let them air dry just so they wouldnt smell bad and develop any unnecessary odors/bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must try scrubbers. I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
    <li> I would say it is great but the scrubby parts could be a bit more scrubby, but I cant complain much because it does get my back, and I also use to get my legs, calves and stuff as well. if I were to make a suggestion, make the scrubby parts a bit more coarse so it can exfoliate better.</li>
    <li> Good quality and easy handle for cleaning my back!</li>
    <li> I love that this is a two piece set. I use the long one for shower body exfoliation and the small round one to exfoliate my face. It does a good job exfoliating yet not too rough on my skin.  I recommend it.  Shipping was fast too</li>
    <li> these are great. I love using them</li>
    <li> I added a photo to this review so you can appreciate the quality of this exfoliator. I have gone through so many in my time and they just don&#x27;t last long. I was happily surprised to get this pack and see how thick and luxurious the exfoliator looked. When I used it, it feels just a great as it looks! This is the first time I have used an exfoliator made from hemp - and I am so enjoying it. I also found that the hemp dries faster use much faster than others I have used... which makes me think it will last that much longer!</li>
    <li> This exfoliating scrubber is very useful and definitely easy to use. It even comes with a face scrubber. I expected the scrubbers to be hard and stiff but it wasn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s gentle on your skin. Great color choices made and the material is soft.  I am pleased with this product. Great for men or women. Try it out</li>
    <li> Decent exfoliant set. Really rough at first, but your skin will adapt. Perfect to get your back and other hard ot reach places in the shower. I recommend wet body and soap for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow with a nice moisurizer when you get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> great and high quality product, love that it is made from all natural sources, the dark part is made of cotton and the exfoliating pad is made of hemp which i understand it is antibacterial, mildew resistant and biodegradable. wish it came with a glove too :-(</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product I just wish the scrubber part went the whole length. I put my product I use on the scrubber and start using it but it doesn&#x27;t seem to lather at all. I feel like it just soaks into the scrubber and sits there.</li>
    <li> works great! really gentle on the skin and great size</li>
    <li> Love this set. I&#x27;ve been looking for a great exfoliating scrubber and this is it.</li>
    <li> I use the exfoliating scrubs in my bath and it is awesome.  All of the dead skin is removed for a smooth and natural glow.  Love it!</li>
