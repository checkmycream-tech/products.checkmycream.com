<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps my toes and nail perky and young</li>
    <li> Omg, i love this set! These are great quality products &amp; was a steal, so i got one for my mother &amp; sister. The lemon cuticle butter is the star, for me. It has truly made a difference. The lip balm is very moisturizing &amp; replenishing. I haven&#x27;t used the foot cream yet, but the other hand lotions are pretty good. The honey &amp; grape seed smells amazing, as well as the milk &amp; almond. The moisture doesn&#x27;t last long though. Overall, great set, but i&#x27;ll just be getting the cuticle butter next time. Glad i tried these though!</li>
    <li> Something relatively small, but it looks so good, give it away as a gift, a decent。Continue to buy next。I like it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I give it away for small gifts, stocking stuffers, etc. I personally use it too. Never heard a complaint about it other than I need more!</li>
    <li> Such a nice feel and smell for toes and tips.</li>
    <li> God quality ... does the job.</li>
    <li> Very small products almost like samples.</li>
    <li> Great gift idea.  My mom and dad liked it.</li>
    <li> Burts Bees makes some great products. Its all natural and a bargain for what you get. I would highly recommend this set as a gift or a combo buy for product to use everyday. Only con is the package is pretty small, all products are purse/travel size.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees. Need I say more??? :)</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of these for Christmas presents and everyone loved them. I have always loved the quality of Burt&#x27;s Bees products. This gift set is nice because you can try a variety of products without having to spend too much money.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as a stocking stuffer, cheap price for stuff that will probably last a couple months.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s preschool teacher for Christmas. It comes with everything it said it would. I thought the sizes would be a little bigger, but I guess that&#x27;s my fault for not looking at the description better. Over all I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. It was a good price and my daughter is excited to give it to her teacher.</li>
    <li> VERY SMALL products in this kit. Sized more for a child. The picture is deceiving, should be titled as a sampler. I&#x27;d like to review the products, if there was enough actual product to use more than once.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected</li>
    <li> Also a mothers day gift, she recently has a thing with her hands so this is awesome! Thanks</li>
    <li> I like it is so nice Very suitable for carrying</li>
    <li> Great product and nice travel sizes.</li>
    <li> Great small gift to add to our day care provider&#x27;s Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> My package came today incomplete....as this was a gift for a friend today and unfortunately had to present it with 2 spots missing in the actual product box. Both the cuticle cream and hand salve containers were missing....I&#x27;m pretty upset and would like this to be addressed so we can either get a refund or the items that I originally purchased.</li>
    <li> STINKS ARGHHHHH&lt;br /&gt;Cuticle one is all right but the rest is just unbearable.</li>
    <li> I love this brand so muchh</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees and it made a great gift.</li>
    <li> Great service, quality is very good</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift. Everyone loves Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s bees.....what else can I say about this fine product.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I thought but great present.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about Burts? Maybe the price.</li>
    <li> l love the almond creme and the almond cuticle creme. love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a gift.  The person who received it was very pleased.  Product is as described.</li>
    <li> Got it for a friend, he loves burts bees!</li>
    <li> Creamy hand lotions, wonderful smells... I mean, talk about the perfect gift for you and your friends.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving these out to ALL of my girlfriends and I know they will be just as pleased as I am with them.&lt;br /&gt;Also, little fun thing here... I wrapped them in lovely hand knitted scarves so it is like two gifts in one and zero unwrapping trash.</li>
    <li> It came faster than expected and my friend, for whom it was gift, was SO excited.  She loved it!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my friend&#x27;s birthday and she loved it. I may order another one for myself. :)</li>
    <li> I love the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s line of products. I got this gift set and had not yet tried the cuticle balm or the hand salve. This is a great little starter kit into the Burt&#x27;s Bees products if you aren&#x27;t sure which ones you want to try. You get a little bit of everything</li>
    <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift and I believe she really liked it</li>
    <li> Love all of them!! Particularly the cuticle cream and the hand cream . My hand are really dry and I can already see the difference in a week.</li>
    <li> I got this for my cousin as an x-mas present but I did so because I loved the one I bought for myself so much I knew she would love it! Yes, the sample sizes are small, but you really do not need to use a lot, a little goes a long way with these products. I am in love with all of their lip balms, and the hand cream is fantastic. I work for a locksmith, so my hands get pretty dry and calloused from all the metals and solvents and dust, but the hand cream fixes all that! I love the smells and everything.</li>
    <li> sent to my friend，she loved it</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees turn out consistently good products, and this kit has some of our favorites bundled up in handy travel sizes.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with Burts bees. I don&#x27;t love the smell but other reviewers claimed the cuticle cream was great. I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all. It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This sampler package is a great value for all the stuff you get.  I love everything in it.  The compact size products are great to slip in your purse or leave in the car console so you can moisturize on the go.  I have really dry skin and Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff is the best for keeping my hands and feet nice in the dry air here.</li>
    <li> I have a very dry hands and cuticle looks so unhealthy. And this stuff Works like magic! And definitely smells good! Worth the $</li>
    <li> Kind of smaller than I expected. More trial/travel size but the products are all great.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s very moist.</li>
    <li> Way to small for price. Have to look for something last minute for my Aunt for Christmas now.</li>
    <li> dented packaging but nice present overall</li>
    <li> Nice variety for testing the products.</li>
    <li> love the package and the variety of products you get in this one little gift set. this is gonna be a great xmas gift and if you know about burts bee&#x27;s products you know your getting quality!!! glad i bought this!!!</li>
    <li> Love the kit, especially the coconut foot creme, I used it before go to bed, and my feet became very smoothy when I wake up the next morning! The lip balm smells yum! And almond milk hand creme works just perfect! A little of everything, I love it!</li>
    <li> Bought for my grandma who has diabetes. She loves it. I always trust this brand.</li>
    <li> Great kit for the price! The products all smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> Fabulous made a great gift</li>
    <li> Used this for our White Elephant Christmas Party gift- and it got stolen many times!</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas present. She loved it.</li>
    <li> Nice gift for my sister.</li>
    <li> Really love the amazing effect on my hands, lip. and feet. Bur I really do not enjoy the smell of the Burt&#x60;s Bees. Anyway, it is great because it&#x60;s natural</li>
    <li> Was a small add-on gift to a larger present for my Wife and I anniversary.  She loves it, and therefore it gets 5 stars.  Great price, neat items inside.</li>
    <li> What can I say they are Burt&#x27;s Bees products, which are always of excellent quality. I gave this to my wife as Christmas present and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Excellent selection of various products. Small sampling sizes that go a long way. Live it all. Would recommend for yourself or a gift.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are a longtime favorite.  This convenient package gives me a nice supply of the products, which sadly are a bit hard to find in my small town.  I am glad to be able to get them so conveniently.</li>
    <li> I have really high expectations with this product, Ive heard so many good things about all these items. So far I don&#x27;t really see any big improvement with my dry skin. All the items are travel size. Good item to buy if you want to try a variety of there products or for a small gift.</li>
    <li> These make wonderful gifts and stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> I love Burts Bees products and the gift box featured here was a prefect add on for a Christmas gift. It included some of their best products and at a better price than my local store.</li>
    <li> WASNT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING EVERTHING SEEM TO BE HAFE FULL BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT SEEMED TO WORK THANKS</li>
    <li> I ordered this as part of a gift basket for a fundraising auction. It arrived in perfect condition and was a great addition!</li>
    <li> As expected, perfect timing delivery</li>
    <li> Wonderful sampler of product. Small packages are great for traveling. I wo0uld buy it again for a gift, but larger bottles or tubes woul be more economical.</li>
    <li> i ended up buying 2 of these... love everything that comes with this</li>
    <li> Great gift at great price, it low priced. I would happy to receive this for Christmas looks like you spent 20+ bucks on it! Have a magical holiday!</li>
    <li> First, the price is very lovely. The products vary from different scents and what&#x27;s more I love the package, it would be very decent to send as a gift.</li>
    <li> Got these as Christmas gifts for the girls in my office.  Nicely packaged sample packs of a little bit of honey heaven.  All the girls loved it!  Glad I came across these, I even got an extra for myseslf.  Love the almond butter!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Tips and Toes Kit, Holiday Gift Set...&lt;br /&gt; Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these as a small thank you for 2 business associates that went above and beyond in their job duties. They were both delighted with it. One even had her husband try to make off with part of it when she got home.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got this for my son as he has dry skin and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Great way to purchase and try several different products, gift or not.  A little of Burt&#x27;s products typically go a long way, and it&#x27;s nice to try different things before buying a larger size.  Variety is the spice of life, and this approach also saves money and limits waste.</li>
    <li> How does a box that wasn&#x27;t opened miss a component? The Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream was gone - I could see through the window before I opened it,  and I was sorta hoping to try that! I thought maybe the product had shifted in transit so I opened it and looked all around it wasn&#x27;t there. It&#x27;s not worth sending back, the hassle factor for something under $13 - but I would go for full size pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Intense Hydration Night Cream, 1.8 oz. !! It&#x27;s a must try &amp; a bargain!</li>
    <li> The kit is very useful. There are six products inside. I like the lipstick and hand cream very much. they are useful in the fall season.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift.  It has all the basic products you need to get started. It is also an excellent starter kit.</li>
    <li> You get so much value out of them.It makes the hand more moisture.I use it every day.It also makes people feel very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is one of the my best purchases on Amazon (which is mostly like a lottery). I love the smell of all the products included, and the size is just enough to test but not too big to get tired of it. The only confusing thing was a foot cream which turned on to be exactly like honey by both texture and stickness.</li>
    <li> My boss loved her boss&#x27; day present. I never saw it, but as long as she&#x27;s happy so am I. . .</li>
    <li> Lovely! Smells heavenly and is the perfect travel kit for hands and feet</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees certainly has a good following and reputation BUT to see this kit at Sears for $6.50 was a shocker to me.&lt;br /&gt;The package looks like it contains an assortment of salesman&#x27;s samples that they would give away. 2 tubes containing only 0.75 of an ounce. One at 4.25 grams and 3 tins of salve weighing only 8.5 grams. The only thing smaller is the text you&#x27;re supposed to read. They should have the courtesy to include a magnifying glass in order to read it.  I&#x27;ll not buy this kit again.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for this kit and wonderful stocking stuffer.  I got 4 of them and everyone loved it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an option for a hostess gift. It&#x27;s simple and tasteful, and easily seperated. We doesn&#x27;t want Burt&#x27;s Bees!?</li>
    <li> I wanted the tiny jar. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> getting all these Burt&#x27;s products for this price is kind of insane, at least where I am one chap-stick costs 6~7 dollars. So this was SO worth it, and they are great products so it is not really a guessing game on the quality,</li>
    <li> I adore Burt&#x27;s bees products. Every single thing is this kit is wonderful, and for a great price!</li>
    <li> Ive been habitual nail biter and cuticle picker. The cuticle cream on this keeps my cuticles from drying out and the urge to pick at them. My nails are also growing out much faster and thicker so its not as easy for me to bite on and chip off. The hand cream is amazing. None of that leftover greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Everything is OK except that the products were manufactured last year, I thought they could be manufactured this year but they are not. they will be gifts for my friends, and I hope they will not mind the data of manufacture.</li>
    <li> This is a great set! I love every piece of it! It all smells good and is natural. What more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> Burton&#x27;s bees products are the best.</li>
    <li> I had always use this product, the feeling is very suitable for my skin。It&#x27;s just feel a little thick，very well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had luck with BB products before and wanted to try a few out without breaking the bank.I found this sampler quite expensive considering the amounts of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every product, save the lip balm, is waxy and sits on top of the skin. My hands seem drier after applying the Almond Milk Beeswax Hand Creme.The cuticle and hand salve never soak in.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the cuticle salve thats in it. I LOVE that stuff. The other items were convenient because I want to try them.  I really liked all of the products in the box. The foot cream and the hand cream in a jar were amazing I&#x27;ll be purchasing the larger size.  This is definitely a sample box. If used religiously I dont think it would last a month.  But definitely a great sampler gift box for those wanting to test products or introduce to friends.</li>
    <li> How disappointing that Burt&#x27;s Bees sold out for money and are now owned by Clorox. Do those executives really think we&#x27;re that stupid? I personally don&#x27;y buy from them for several good reasons, so why do they think I&#x27;ll suddenly buy from them if they own another company? Maybe the parent company ought to stop its irresponsible use of chemicals and animal testing. If they greenwash us with their &amp;#34;Greenworks&amp;#34; why would we trust them with Burt&#x27;s Bees? Another good company lost to the thieves and villains.</li>
    <li> I love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products! I love that they are a natural substitute for all those chemical laden beauty products out there. I feel good about my family being able to still use beauty products without having to worry about the chemicals they might be exposed to in the process. I would highly recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees to anyone! And I love the light fruity fragrance they always have, too!</li>
    <li> love the kit.It would be prefect for travel.</li>
    <li> I love Burts Bees and their quality products.</li>
    <li> The person I bought this gift set for is very picky with what she uses anymore, but Burt&#x27;s Bees made her list. It was the perfect little gift set. Good size as well, which I knew each item was only going to be slightly larger than a travel size, thanks to others reviews.</li>
    <li> Very Good. I like the products of Burt&#x27;s Bee. And I can try different items from Burt&#x27;s Bee by using this kit.</li>
    <li> I bought it for xmas gift and one for myself to try.  Good deal and I got five different products to try out, good natural ingredient and it claims it&#x27;s close to 99% natural, no harm; have to get used to the smell!</li>
    <li> I only used the cuticle cream and the foot lotion in the case. The cuticle cream is amazing, I wash my hands constantly so this really helps put the moisture back in my fingers,and I haven&#x27;t had the nasty looking dried out nails since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff in this little bag of tricks!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love any Burt&#x27;s Bees products. Always superior quality.</li>
    <li> Awesome buy! I like testing products before buying the full sized versions. The sizes in the kit are also convenient for on-the-go/travel! My favorites are the almond hand cream and coconut foot cream, which I will be buying in full size. I&#x27;m planning to reuse the small almond cream jar to put I my purse and keep the full size at home. In regards to the coconut foot cream, a lot goes a long way! I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> actually i havent used this as of yet but its all ready to use-i love burts bees-use the lip glosses all time</li>
    <li> Good variety of products.  All seem to work well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as part of a Christmas gift.  It was exacty as stated, and my sister was happy, as she has not yet used these products before.  It was shipped well, although it arrived with the box a bit dented.  Overall, I was still happy and so was my sister.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my friend and she loved it! def unique and very useful. burts bees rocks! thanks</li>
    <li> My sister enjoyed the gift immensely, but I must admit surprise. There was not one bee in the kit! Nor any bee&#x27;s wax! What kind of America is it that bee related items are not accompanied by actual bees. Somehow this is the fault of [insert politician or political group name here]!</li>
    <li> Love love it is very good</li>
    <li> I love giving these kits as gifts.  It gives people a chance to try it out.  Good marketing.  I don&#x27;t have experience with this particular kit but I have tried other Burt&#x27;s Bees and loved them.</li>
    <li> I bought as part of gift basket wonderful she loved it and is a quality product&lt;br /&gt;. I will purchase again</li>
    <li> excellent product, had cream really soften rough hands, would recommend to anyone bought as a gift for daughter who loves Bees products</li>
    <li> Gift for a friend and she loved it! I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products myself; all the products are wonderful!</li>
    <li> I buy these quite often.  They are the perfect travel and purse size or great if you haven&#x27;t tried burts bees and want to try these products without purchasing them individually.</li>
    <li> I have never bought a Burt&#x27;s Bees product I didn&#x27;t like. They are natural products that work and smell great. The cuticle cream is wonderful. I also love the hand cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, so have not used this product myself. The recipient, however, was very happy with the product.  The gift was opened in the presence of others who, when they saw it, wanted it for themselves, so that&#x27;s the sign of a good product.</li>
    <li> The Foot cream had about 30/40% of the tube , couldn&#x27;t understand what could have happened with that. Rest all products are good and soothing as expected.</li>
    <li> Love all these products! Not too many junk ingredients. All very moisturizing and smell heavenly!</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend in need :) all smiles</li>
    <li> Would make a nice token gift, but the portions are too small to be of much use if you use these type products every day.</li>
    <li> RIP OFF !!!  box is tiny the stock photo is very misleading !  big disappointment Burts and Amazon I cannot gift this silly thing</li>
    <li> In case many of you that have written negative reviews don&#x27;t know, Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t typically sell economy size products. At 11ish bucks, It makes a great add-on gift or stocking stuffer. It came as pictured and I am highly satisfied, thank you!</li>
    <li> Good value and always a pleaser as Christmas gifts to office co-workers and friends. went over well for white elephant too</li>
    <li> Bought as little Mother&#x27;s Day gifts for ladies who have been very nice to me.  They all loved the selection of Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so smalle.but i like it.</li>
    <li> Little smaller than I thought.  And I can buy the same thing at Walmart for cheaper.</li>
    <li> The listing clearly lists the sizes but it&#x27;s hard to know exactly how much that is. I knew it was small based on what I&#x27;ve seen in the stores. Honestly I probably could have scoured the stores and found this same thing, and possibly for a couple bucks cheaper. But this is a nice set for a decent/average price and will make a good gift.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my sister in law for Christmas! She loved it!  Has a nice assortment of great products!  Got a great price for the set!</li>
    <li> Made a great gift for a secret santa exchange!</li>
    <li> I like honey and grapeseed hand cream~</li>
    <li> This is a lot smaller than I thought. This package is 5 1/2 x 6 1/2 inches so there is not much product in it. The picture is deceiving. As far as the product itself, I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a gift.</li>
    <li> Great little gift for stocking stuffers or a little Thank-You....</li>
    <li> All these products are natural and easy to use. No long lasting stickiness. This would be a good gift.</li>
    <li> Love it, so nice and soothing and smells and tastes great! That&#x27;s the problem, the grandbabies keep sneaking them out of my bag and eating them (the chapstick)!</li>
    <li> Very good. I very love it.</li>
    <li> Great kit would buy it again</li>
    <li> I have been using their honey lip balm for many years and I love it.  So far I have used the foot cream and it is great.</li>
    <li> Sizes are all trials. I would think package with daily use would last one to two months. With the variety and price I think you could pay 12$ a month and use this indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I love everything by Burt&#x27;s Bees and this is the perfect combination of travel-sized, purse-friendly products!</li>
    <li> This was a perfect little trial kit. It allowed me to experience, smell and feel all the different products and I love them all. I wish I had snagged a few more when they were on sale.</li>
    <li> giving a christmas gift.  great value from what I have seen</li>
    <li> Recently bought this kit before I committed to the larger sizes.  I was a bit skeptical of the foot and hand creams.  I have used the cuticle cream in the past and love it.  Love love love them all.  This is a great size for traveling or overnight stay.  Also a great buy if you are having house guests and want to treat them special!!!  Highly highly recommend!!!  There are a few different kits out there.  These kits are great because there are always one or two products that I would not have probably tried if it hadn&#x27;t been for the trial size.  Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees for offering these sample kits.  They are a way to get us hooked on more of your products!!!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.  She loves Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
    <li> the best combination of burt bees products, all of them work really good, i definitely will buy more of this to give to my friends</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time on this it isn&#x27;t a good deal and the items smell awful, unless you are a hardcore Burts Bees user it seriously isn&#x27;t that great, the only thing I found good was the lip balm everything else got thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion smells horrible and makes your hands feel oily&lt;br /&gt;The foot cream is so thick and goopy it does nothing for your feet&lt;br /&gt;the cuticle cream I didn&#x27;t even try because it stinks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy Burts Bees products but not this set</li>
    <li> I got this kit for my mother who is having trouble with neuropathy due to chemo.  Especially in the winter now, the skin on her fingers and heels cracks easily.  She has a heck of a time finding lotion that will stay on long enough to protect her skin and at the same time is not greasy.  She was a big fan of the Burts Bees kit.  She said it helps a lot to keep the cracking to a minimum.  In particular, the beeswax hand cream worked well.</li>
    <li> While this is a sampler pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees products the sizes are large enough to be worth while. I especially like the foot cream and the lip balm but all are quality products packaged in an attractive box. A great gift idea for those times when you don&#x27;t know what to get.</li>
    <li> The young woman I bought this gift for told me she loved it!  So who am I to question my choice of gifts??</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this kit!! I use this once a week on my hands for my manicure and i absolutely love the smell of the honey hand cream!</li>
    <li> the items in this kit look like they are full size but one you open the box you realize they are very tiny, almost trial sizes.</li>
    <li> Natural healing from callus split hands &amp; feet and chapped lips during the cold winter&#x27;s onslaught.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the whole body</li>
    <li> This is a cute little set, perfect for trying new products or as a gift. I ordered a number as baby shower favors and liked the way they turned out. If you like one or two Burt&#x27;s Bees Products and want to try a few new ones, this would be the way to go. It has all my favorites.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute set,including many useful skin care products.It is very useful in winter.I will buy it again after I used it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife as a gift. She loves it and is constantly recommending it to other people. I figured that means it&#x27;s worthy of a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> My sister loves Burt&#x27;s Bees products. This kit is really great especially for the price! Also make for a great Christmas present!</li>
    <li> Heard good things about Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so when came across hands and feet kit thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  Foot creme works very well, especially on rough winter heels... applied lotion and covered with socks overnight.  Imagine consistent use will keep feet in good condition long term.  Love the lime cuticle salve, great smell.  Hand creme and hand salve are OK, not fond of smell. Kit was offered at a great price, disappointed that 2 main products (in tubes) were travel size... thus my 4 rating.  Have since purchased a regular size foot creme.</li>
    <li> The picture really doesn&#x27;t give you an idea of what this would be like,  I guess I should have checked dimensions on the product but I had bought this as a gift for a small family I know thinking there was something for everyone in it. When I got it I was like, sheesh this isn&#x27;t even enough for one adult!</li>
    <li> better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so good and fantastic item. you can not have anything better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to buy one more for my friend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Burts Bees so I Bought this as a Christmas present. The recipient was thrilled. Would purchase for myself.</li>
    <li> Ordered two sets of the Burt&#x27;s bees tips and toes kit as a Christmas gift.  Was stated that i would get them on or before Dec 24. Was so frustrated that When I got the package on Dec. 24, there was just one set on the box and i emailed them right away. They said they were going to ship the other one , didn&#x27;t even say the reason why both sets didn&#x27;t ship at the same time.  Now, it&#x27;s already Jan 2, and still didn&#x27;t get the 2nd set.  Would definitely not recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the smell. but the lip product is good. I don&#x27;t recommend this.the hand cream is quite dry and feel not good.</li>
    <li> First of all, if you think that these are full sized, please read the description carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these a stocking stuffer this past Christmas, and was really pleased! I am a die-hard Burt&#x27;s Bees fan, and when I got these little testers, I was ecstatic. They measure a couple inches talk, and the salves are about an inch in diameter. They all smell very good, and go on pretty smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion: The smell is to DIE for. It is very long wearing, and doesn&#x27;t absorb right away. It keeps skin moisturized for a long period of time. I use it at night before bed, or keep it in my purse while I am at work. It&#x27;s been really good for this winter, and healed cracking in between my fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foot Cream: It has a very thick texture, and is best used before bed, or after a shower. I rub it into my feet and let the product soak in a little bit. Afterwards, I put on cotton socks and let it soak in over night. I wake up with lovely, soft feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salve: It is very thick, and very moisturizing. I also keep this in my my purse and use it for any cracking in between my fingers as well as my cuticles. It stays in place, and doesn&#x27;t absorb too quickly. (I like it, others may not)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, I really love the products. I bought a full size of the lotion, and have fallen madly in love. I&#x27;m sad to see my mini-lotion run out in the near future, so investing in the full size is worth it!</li>
    <li> Love the kit, especially the coconut foot creme, I used it before go to bed, and my feet became very smoothy when I wake up the next morning! The lip balm smells yum! And almond milk hand creme works just perfect! A little of everything, I love it!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m puzzle about what i should prepare for a baby, luckly i find it. without consider what type, what function, what i miss, this is the totally solution.</li>
    <li> Great to carry in your purse or bag</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> My mom specifically requested two of the items in this pack and I knew she needed to try the Lemon Cuticle Balm, because it&#x27;s amazing, so this gift set was a perfect match!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife, thought I&#x27;d be a good husband and massage her feet/hands. The honey foot oil/rub is really good, sticky, but it dries in. My wife did not like the feeling at first, thought the stickiness would stay around...but it didn&#x27;t. Good product(s), just wish they were bigger sizes.</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, another wonderful set of products-always great!</li>
    <li> So I purchased this a gift for my step-sister. We all have the relative that we absolutely cant stand but want to be the bigger person when it comes to gift giving. I wanted something cheap that would still be used regularly and wouldnt wind up in a closet or draw. This kit is packed nice and seams to have a lot of usefull things. However i was very upset to find it at a local grocer for 5 dollars cheaper. I have amazon prime and have been trying to purchase more daily options (like deodorant and other items) online instead of having to deal with the crowds in stores.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this as a gift because I wanted to try the products. Context: I&#x27;m dark skinned, I like the outdoors, and I cook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almond Milk Beeswax Hand Cream: I washed my hands after lunch, then tried this. Beeswax is right - very waxy and gluey, and took forever to absorb. Smells like almond paste. I would NOT keep this in my desk at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pomegranate Lip Balm: The hint of color is invisible on my lips. No SPF, so not suitable for daytime wear for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honey-Grapeseed Hand Cream: Sticky. Takes forever to absorb. It&#x27;s honey, I get it, but I need to be able to moisturize my hands and move on without the things I touch getting sticky. Would definitely not keep at work or in the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Foot Cream: Super goopy and sticky. I put it on my feet one morning (and had to wait forever for it to absorb into my hands even after I washed my hands), then put on wool socks and boots and went about my day. When I showered at night, the tub floor became VERY slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream: I like the smell of lemon sugar and this was the only part of the gift set I genuinely liked and would use, so I searched Target for the cuticle cream by itself. I thought I&#x27;d use it as a hand lotion before bed. Turns out it&#x27;s about ten dollars. Ehh... I&#x27;ll stick to my $6 unscented body lotion and $2 cocoa butter lip balm with SPF.</li>
    <li> I broke open the box and put all of the pieces in my wife&#x27;s stocking for christmas, she was quite pleased. BB makes good stuff.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees offers natural products and this particular kit featured items for the hands and feet.  It was a bit cheaper to buy online versus some big box stores.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a &amp;#34;winter survival kit&amp;#34;.  The person that received the gift was very happy with it and the selection of products it contained.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  Nicely presented, good price and appreciated by her.  She is very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Great surprise for the wife. In the middle of an argument?  bring this out from behind you and now you too can play video games instead of the laundry.</li>
    <li> Great for dry hands feet and lips. The hand cream smells soo good, like milk and honey. Will buy the larger ones now.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for mother&#x27;s day. I really enjoyed seeing her face when she opened it!! Of course she loved it... Her hands are always dry and the loation did just the trick!!</li>
    <li> It a big wast of time. There are better products out there that cost much more, and much less that work better</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Girlfriend and she loves it. She uses the stuff all the time. I didn&#x27;t want to get the big kit just in case she didn&#x27;t like it but it looks like I&#x27;ll have to buy one now.</li>
    <li> Kinda small. Box contains sample sizes only! Package was smaller than a small tablet or mini iPad. I guess I thought I was getting a nice gift set. Ended up having to by something eLse to go with it so that I didn&#x27;t look cheap. Doesn&#x27;t Burt&#x27;s make regular size products?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  The product amount is just enough to get a few applications so you can see if you really like the product or not.  It would be prefect for travel.</li>
    <li> i love burts products!  this package was nice, but when they came, we were surprised they were so small.  good product and a fair price but just....small.</li>
    <li> I actually found this at Walgreens for the same price, but I am happy with the kit. The almond face cream is exquisite and I want to buy a big jar now.</li>
    <li> Got a few of these as stocking stuffers for friends/family at Christmas - they all love the products, and much cheaper than putting something similar together.</li>
    <li> This was a nice way to try out some of the products I had never used before in the burt&#x27;s bees product line. I liked and noticed an improvement after each product except for one, the Pomegranate Lip Balm. This seems to dry out my lips rather than moisturize them.  I do put it on right before going outside in the cold wind though and it does protect my lips from wind burn. I don&#x27;t really like any lip balm/chapstick product so this may be an overall thing for me. I have friends who really like it though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy I bought the set. It was a great price point to be able to figure out the products I liked from the products I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The thought that a single product and the same size, I did not expect reduced as souvenirs. Feeling a little cheated. Things still recognized</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Shipping was so fast!  This was a great deal for the nice creams and lotions that come in this package.  I gave it as a gift and she loved it as much as me!</li>
    <li> goods is rigth,but the express too later!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift.  Receiver said it arrived in perfect condition!  Love Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> GREAT stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> pretty good! take it when I travel or work.it is convenient.and it is natural.I liked them, next time I will also choose it.</li>
    <li> Love all the Burt&#x27;s Bees products. This is going to be a gift for a loved one. I won a gift set awhile back and liked the chance to try some different products.</li>
    <li> Very good natural products! my girlfriend also like it with me :) It&#x27;s very Appreciated when company makes 100% natural ingredients production.</li>
    <li> Awesome kit for my feet.  They deserve to be pampered too  :)</li>
    <li> Great holiday gift! Bought for a co-worker and she loved it!!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t get uesd to the smell</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Purchased it for friends and family, especially my father likes it as he is a diabetic and the products really help his skin.</li>
    <li> This product makes for a great present. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees, especially at a reasonable price. Awesome</li>
    <li> I think they&#x27;re really small sizes.  I like everything ok except the hand cream... It stains all my things?&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and highly recommend.  I bought these little samplers to put a personal touch to gift certificates.  Everyone to whom I gave them, if not already familiar with Burt&#x27;s Bees, has become a fan.  Also, price and delivery were excellent.</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer. Filled with many Burts Bees favorites for a good price.</li>
    <li> Winter is my worse time. These products have helped me so much I cant say enough. Thank you</li>
    <li> purchased as gift for daycare staff.  received nice comments about it</li>
    <li> Due to the dry conditions in Colorado I was desperate this winter to find a moisturizer that worked. I bought the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s trial set because of the variety of hand and foot products it offers. I thought that price was fair since the samples were small. It also fits great in your purse. Unfortunately, I cannot get over the smell of it. I know it&#x27;s all natural but other than the Coconut Foot cream and the Lip Balm, the other products smell awful. I haven&#x27;t been able to use any of it.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my adult daughter and she loved it.  She has been wanting to try their products.</li>
    <li> The foot cream is a little sticky if you don&#x27;t wash it off your hands after putting it on your feet (feels fine on the feet though). The almond hand cream smells WONDERFUL, as does the lemon butter cream. This is a good way to try several different products to what which things you like enough to want in full-size.</li>
    <li> I got this set for my sister&#x27;s birthday gift. She LOVED it and uses it every day. I like how they are travel-size too.</li>
    <li> It is what it is, my girls like it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. My girlfriend loves it!!</li>
    <li> Great kit and you get a lot of product for what you pay for! I have sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with any of the lotions or creams. The only complaint I have is that they don&#x27;t smell very good. Based on the brand and the scents of the products I guess I was expecting a bit of a stronger fragrance and less of the medicinal scent, but since the kit is more to repair than to maintain I guess it makes sense that they smell more medicinal. I will definitely purchase this again - it&#x27;s a great grab gift during the holidays, and one that I would not mind taking back during a swap game!</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift and the girl friend enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> I always love Burt&#x27;s Bees and this made a nice little gift.</li>
    <li> The size is really small! The only product I don&#x27;t like is the foot cream-- doesn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
    <li> Great little accumulation of items. Good for pampering or to use as a to-go or travel set.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected.. Kinda cheaply packaged.</li>
    <li> Product came promptly and was as described.</li>
    <li> Im sure she will love it. Shipped fast, Price was good compared to buying each item outright. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> read carefully before purchasing....this is for little girls who hands are tiny...lol....I got caught buying without reading...these things are so tiny...its like a sampler set...some of these reviews have to be fake...just sayin</li>
    <li> This is the bees knees.</li>
    <li> Great little gift set!</li>
    <li> It smell great.&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes all of the stuffs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for a gift exchange.  It was a big hit -- everyone seems to love Burt&#x27;s Bees!  Their lotions are great.  I like how effective they are at moisturizing during cold winter months, and the peppermint scent is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought it set for mom.She like a lot.She said that it is good quality.She like nature food Maintenance skin.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughters have been using these and they love using the products for their mother/daughter pedi time together.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom on Mother&#x27;s Day. She loved all the products in the gift set. The smell is especially good! :)</li>
    <li> Really made my husband&#x27;s feet so much softer on the first use!</li>
    <li> The tubs could be a little larger for what you pay, but these have definitely helped improve the skin around my fingertips, which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, was in good condition on arrival, and was well received as a gift. Overall, excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> Great gift package to give out to friends as a gift or a traveling kit to pamper yourself.</li>
    <li> I didn’t really care for the flavors once I smelled them. The only items my husband and I cared for were the coconut foot cream and the lip balm.</li>
    <li> Loved these products! I wish I could buy the lemon butter in this size as it&#x27;s perfect for my pocket and purse. The almond milk hand cream smells delicious (this is a favorite scent of mine) but isn&#x27;t the best hand cream I&#x27;ve tried. The pomegranate lip balm is amazing- smells great, feels great. The hand salve smells awful but does leave your hands soft and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger. The coconut foot cream also smells good and works well. The lotion is so-so. Not fantastic. Not awful. Probably not worth the full-size money.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and was everything I wanted. Used as a gift.</li>
    <li> Smaller than it looks. Good for a lame gift someone can sample.</li>
    <li> Safe and effective Smell is pure and fresh nice nice nice~~</li>
    <li> This is a really great sampler, and the price I paid was fantastic. Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff is not super cheap, so this is a great way to try out several of their best items for not much money. I was thinking of getting a full size tin of the lemon cuticle butter, since I have one at work I use often because it&#x27;s amazing. Instead I got this whole set for just a few dollars more. These are sampler sizes, so they&#x27;re small, but that&#x27;s great for carrying in a purse or pocket. The cuticle butter (which smells delicious!) will last ages even in this small tin, and the lip balm is full size. I put on the honey hand cream first thing, and it smells wonderful and feels great. Not sticky at all, just softening. I know from past experience I like the foot cream, and am looking forward to trying out the almond &amp; milk hand cream. The hand salve is fantastic - my dad who is a mechanic and has the hands to prove it recommends it highly. It smells like rosemary.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this set, and looking forward to using it all up... and I might buy this same set again when it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
    <li> Got this starter kit as a gift and I started loving Burt&#x27;s Bees Brand! All their products are just sooo good!</li>
    <li> Perfect little gift for the 20 to 30 year old women in your life. Small size fits great in purses and diaper bags. Even guys can use this kit as the scents are gender neutral.</li>
    <li> Perfect protection to my hands and lips.</li>
    <li> Wonderful varity of products, great for everyone.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift, but it was a great price on those products.</li>
    <li> The product is compact, for family use, good. If there are included for mosquito that paragraph suit is good, here hand with a little more.产品小巧精致，送给家人用，不错。如果有包含治疗蚊虫那款的套装就好了，这里手上用的有点多了</li>
    <li> Love it, and it&#x27;s very Cost-effective.</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas gift.  Recipient loved it.</li>
    <li> i ALWAYS LOVE Burt&#x27;s bees products.</li>
    <li> I purchasedthis for christmas gifts,they werea great hit with the girls.  I have always found Burts Bees products to be sesitive to my skin because of the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Picture is very misleading. Items are tiny - not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Nice kit well priced and delivered right on time.</li>
    <li> this makes a great gift. everything smells and feels great. fits perfect in purses or bags and backpacks. products for different body parts. smell edibly delicious!</li>
    <li> I gave this kit to my friend for her birthday and she really liked it!&lt;br /&gt;Good product.&lt;br /&gt;I want one too haha</li>
    <li> The whole thing seemed to me that it would be bigger than it actually was. But my mom still really liked it when I gave it to her for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I buy things in USA Amazon.I like it.</li>
    <li> I love the cuticle cream, it&#x27;s the whole reason that I bought this.  The foot cream and the hand cream smell awesome!  I&#x27;m not a super fan of their lip stuff because it&#x27;s pretty waxy, and the hand salve and teeny jar of hand stuff are ok, but not realistic for me.  I prefer lotion that you don&#x27;t have to dig out with your fingernails.</li>
