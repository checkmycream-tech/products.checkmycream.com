### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>looking at my nails makes me happy!</li>
      <li>Beautiful!  </li>
      <li>One of the best glitter polishes I&#x27;ve ever had!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful.  </li>
      <li>This is a dupe for Rainbow Connection and is just as great.</li>
      <li>I seriously LOVE this!!</li>
      <li>It goes great alone!! :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I have this on right now and it looks great!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this glitter!</li>
      <li>All the reviews swear that this glitter is amazing and can be worn alone or matched with any color.  </li>
      <li>and I have liked them.  </li>
      <li>I own both, so I know :)</li>
      <li>I love this glitter nail polish.  </li>
      <li>so I decided to apply Miami Beet (2 coats) and this glitter on top.  </li>
      <li>So glad I started with my toes.  </li>
      <li>Layered on, they mostly they appear as circles in mine.</li>
      <li>I also like the many colors of glitter in the &amp;#34;Chasing Rainbows&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Looks much better than the picture.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this polish...</li>
      <li>I love to do a top coat of glitter for my pedi.</li>
      <li>then proceed to use your polish with any top coat.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I ordered Rose of Light (also by OPI) and loved it so much that I went ahead and ordered Chasing Rainbows.  </li>
      <li>Lots of fun!!</li>
      <li>And it dries very quickly so that helps with putting on as many coats as you need or want.</li>
      <li>It adds just the right touch of that &amp;#34;something extra.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve always liked OPI products and this on is another product that I like.  </li>
      <li>absolutely LOVE this fun glitter!</li>
      <li>the polish comes off easily without sitting there forever trying to use nail polish remover....</li>
      <li>a beautiful gold/with sparkly different colored squares.</li>
      <li>If you want colorful glitter coverage, it requires many layers.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear glitter every day or even every week, but I enjoy the OPI Chasing Rainbows.</li>
      <li>Fantastic color and Coverage</li>
      <li>This is great layered on top of other polishes.</li>
      <li>so I got out my OPI Glow-up Already (A beautiful sparkly gold) and added a few of my fine glitters (yes-I&#x27;m mixing polishes all the time) and VIOLA!</li>
      <li>The thicker it gets the better and then proceed to add the mixture (OPI has some beautiful sparkly polishes or plain colors if you prefer)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and the glitter and sparkling reminds me of party time and NEW YEARS EVE.</li>
      <li>This is a good alternative for &amp;#34;Rainbow Connection&amp;#34; if you missed the Muppets Collection back in 2011.  </li>
      <li>but the pieces are much larger than what I was accustomed to in Rose of Light.  </li>
      <li>Love this,I have been wearing it over pale blue polish on my feet and it looks as perfect now as it did three weeks</li>
      <li>Its long lasting, and an awesome look</li>
      <li>I hope you&#x27;ll have fun with this polish and become a &#x27;mixologist&#x27; like</li>
      <li>O.k color, to many colors in one bottle, so it&#x27;s to busy for me, nothing stands out.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping, as well.  </li>
      <li>I have two bottles of Rainbow Connection because I love it, so I went ahead and bought this one because I thought it would be different.</li>
      <li>First, this glitter is pretty</li>
      <li>I wear this glitter with pretty much everything!</li>
      <li>There are these really pretty magenta glitter pieces</li>
      <li>/&gt;To make getting the polish to come off easier use two bottom coats of my favorite Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insti Dry.</li>
      <li>I was expecting this to be very colorful glitter, but it has a lot more clear polish and less glitter when you put it on.</li>
      <li>It clumped and came off extremely fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same as Nicole by OPI Rainbow in the S-kylie, which I loved using until it dried out.</li>
      <li>have given this tip to many of my other glitter polish reviews</li>
      <li>I was very surprised when I started putting it on my toe nails and saw how much it glittered, so I applied it to my hands, too.  </li>
      <li>I will not be purchasing anymore OPI polishes I have too many of the same OPI polishes that I purchased from collections thinking I&#x27;m getting something new only to find I already have it, it&#x27;s just been renamed and put in a new collection.</li>
      <li>This Chasing rainbows color is the exact same polish as the Nicole by OPI Kardashian Kollection \\&quot;Rainbow</li>
      <li>and I am definitely far from 12.  </li>
      <li>I like it when the bottom coats are thick (and it will thicken) because it leaves a better ridge.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a sparkle like no other...</li>
      <li>It came early and there are a bunch of different colors and sizes of glitter in the polish.</li>
      <li>It only took three coats to completely cover my entire nail.</li>
      <li>When you are ready to change you simply have to peel back (there should be a slight ridge made by the Insti Dry)&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
</ol>

<li> A little sheer, wore it over another color.</li>
<li> The polish is made up of several different pieces of different colored &#x27;chips&#x27; in a clear base.  </li>
<li> Its a combination of multi colored (pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, silver) small round glitter and larger hex glitter in a clear base.</li>
<li> just to make it a little easier to put on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I had to do a little thinking with this one.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not interested in waisting anymore of my money!!</li>
<li> Carnivale all year round.  </li>
<li> I have been on a glitter nail kick as of late.  </li>
<li> If it gets too thick (whatever you use) get a lacquer thinner  </li>
<li> The glitter lacquer was very thick and the glitter did not spread well.  </li>
<li> It may have been the base color I chose.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t even need a base coat!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Another winner from OPI</li>
    <li> This Chasing rainbows color is the exact same polish as the Nicole by OPI Kardashian Kollection \\&quot;Rainbow In The Skylie\\&quot; I&#x27;m do over OPI making yhe same polish sn5d putting it in a different collection.  I will not be purchasing anymore OPI polishes I have too many of the same OPI polishes that I purchased from collections thinking I&#x27;m getting something new only to find I already have it, it&#x27;s just been renamed and put in a new collection. I&#x27;m not interested in waisting anymore of my money!!</li>
    <li> I have this on right now and it looks great! It only took three coats to completely cover my entire nail. And it dries very quickly so that helps with putting on as many coats as you need or want. Love it!</li>
    <li> One of the best glitter polishes I&#x27;ve ever had!! Doesn&#x27;t even need a base coat! It goes great alone!! :)</li>
    <li> I have been on a glitter nail kick as of late.  I ordered Rose of Light (also by OPI) and loved it so much that I went ahead and ordered Chasing Rainbows.  All the reviews swear that this glitter is amazing and can be worn alone or matched with any color.  It may have been the base color I chose.  There are these really pretty magenta glitter pieces so I decided to apply Miami Beet (2 coats) and this glitter on top.  So glad I started with my toes.  First, this glitter is pretty but the pieces are much larger than what I was accustomed to in Rose of Light.  And since I couldn&#x27;t control the glitter distribution very well it made my toes just look messy.  Maybe I should try wearing this alone.  But the rainbow colors made me feel like I was 12 and I am definitely far from 12.  If I try again I shall update.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this polish... it&#x27;s basically a re-release of Rainbow Connection, which is way too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just looking at my nails makes me happy!</li>
    <li> I purchased two colors of this glitter lacquer.  I have used OPI products before and I have liked them.  The glitter lacquer was very thick and the glitter did not spread well.  It clumped and came off extremely fast.</li>
    <li> O.k color, to many colors in one bottle, so it&#x27;s to busy for me, nothing stands out.</li>
    <li> This sparkles like a bottle of liquid sunshine!  I was very surprised when I started putting it on my toe nails and saw how much it glittered, so I applied it to my hands, too.  It&#x27;s beautiful.  Looks much better than the picture.</li>
    <li> I had to do a little thinking with this one. The polish is made up of several different pieces of different colored &#x27;chips&#x27; in a clear base.  It would take several coats to cover your nail and would use up tons of the &#x27;squares&#x27; so I got out my OPI Glow-up Already (A beautiful sparkly gold) and added a few of my fine glitters (yes-I&#x27;m mixing polishes all the time) and VIOLA! a beautiful gold/with sparkly different colored squares. Yes, the colors come through. I have been on a binge mixing polishes for the last year or so and when I am l/3 through the bottle I start mixing what&#x27;s left with another.&lt;br /&gt;The colors will shine through and two coats will do for coverage but check my &#x27;TIP&#x27; (now I can&#x27;t remember which rating I put it so I&#x27;ll repeat it here.)&lt;br /&gt;To make getting the polish to come off easier use two bottom coats of my favorite Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insti Dry. The thicker it gets the better and then proceed to add the mixture (OPI has some beautiful sparkly polishes or plain colors if you prefer) then proceed to use your polish with any top coat. When you are ready to change you simply have to peel back (there should be a slight ridge made by the Insti Dry)&lt;br /&gt;and the polish comes off easily without sitting there forever trying to use nail polish remover....it would take all day.  I like it when the bottom coats are thick (and it will thicken) because it leaves a better ridge.  If it gets too thick (whatever you use) get a lacquer thinner  just to make it a little easier to put on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I have given this tip to many of my other glitter polish reviews o I hope you&#x27;ll have fun with this polish and become a &#x27;mixologist&#x27; like me!&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck&lt;br /&gt;Sherrie</li>
    <li> I have two bottles of Rainbow Connection because I love it, so I went ahead and bought this one because I thought it would be different. The only difference is that the glitter pieces are hexagons instead of circles. Layered on, they mostly they appear as circles in mine. But yes, if you missed out on Rainbow Connection, get this one. It&#x27;s like having ten disco balls on your finger tips.</li>
    <li> A little sheer, wore it over another color.</li>
    <li> I love to do a top coat of glitter for my pedi. This hits the spot! Its long lasting, and an awesome look</li>
    <li> I had been &amp;#34;chasing&amp;#34; OPI&#x27;s Rainbow Connection for a long time but just didn&#x27;t want to spend the inflated prices for it. Finally, OPI released this. This is a dupe for Rainbow Connection and is just as great. It offers a wide variety of color and size glitters and applies without issue. This is great layered on top of other polishes.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to be very colorful glitter, but it has a lot more clear polish and less glitter when you put it on. If you want colorful glitter coverage, it requires many layers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this glitter! Its a combination of multi colored (pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, silver) small round glitter and larger hex glitter in a clear base. It&#x27;s exactly the same as Nicole by OPI Rainbow in the S-kylie, which I loved using until it dried out. I wear this glitter with pretty much everything!</li>
    <li> Beautiful!  Just like the gel but not gel.</li>
    <li> Fantastic color and Coverage</li>
    <li> absolutely LOVE this fun glitter!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and the glitter and sparkling reminds me of party time and NEW YEARS EVE.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a sparkle like no other...this is it!! I seriously LOVE this!! It came early and there are a bunch of different colors and sizes of glitter in the polish. Lots of fun!!</li>
    <li> This is a good alternative for &amp;#34;Rainbow Connection&amp;#34; if you missed the Muppets Collection back in 2011.  Its actually the same polish. I own both, so I know :)</li>
    <li> I love this glitter nail polish.  I use it in a relatively thin coat over light or pastel nail colors to add some shine &amp; to break up the colors.  It adds just the right touch of that &amp;#34;something extra.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve always liked OPI products and this on is another product that I like.  I also like the many colors of glitter in the &amp;#34;Chasing Rainbows&amp;#34; glitter polish.  I don&#x27;t wear glitter every day or even every week, but I enjoy the OPI Chasing Rainbows.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Carnivale all year round.  Super fast shipping, as well.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this,I have been wearing it over pale blue polish on my feet and it looks as perfect now as it did three weeks ago!I have had strangers walk up to me and ask me what polish I&#x27;am wearing,that never happened before.</li>
