<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product for dull hair. Looks a bit artificial, like shine on wigs. Ladies, nothing gives exactly the same result as naturally shiny hair, but this product gets very close.</li>
    <li> REALLY LIKE THE WAY IT MAKES MY HAIR SHINE.  I USE IT WHEN MY HAIR IS WET AND WHEN IT IS DRY WITH GREAT RESULTS.</li>
    <li> Good product. Not like the others in that it doesn&#x27;t weight hair down(I have baby fine thin hair). Keeps shiny for quite awhile. I don&#x27;t use everday as it has a bit of alcohol in it and will dry the hair out.</li>
    <li> My hair acquired a incredible shine and softness!! There is nothing like this product!! The smell is very nice too!! You will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I love This product!!! I usually pay twice as much in stores for it so when I found it here I was extatic!! I will be reordering on a monthly basis!</li>
    <li> I love the It&#x27;s a Ten product line; starting out by trying the leave in conditioner.  I just tried the shampoo and hair mask and think they are AMAZING, but I was not too crazy about the leave in shine product. I have had much better and was actually quite surprised; I expected way more from this line.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on my thin hair.  I spray it on once dry prior to using my flat iron.  What I love about it is that unlike other oils, etc. it does not weigh my hair down nor make it look greasy.  It is excellent!  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Excellent for blond high lasted hair. It conditions and keeps hair shinny without being to heavy</li>
    <li> This spray is one of the best anti-frizz shine sprays I&#x27;ve ever used. Its not greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair. Just wish I could buy it a local store &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Great price</li>
    <li> I have tried so many hair products. I don&#x27;t have the shampoo and leave-in treatment yet, but judging \\&quot;Miracle\\&quot; on the shine spray, I think I have found my new saving grace! I am 40-something and my hair is \\&quot;highlighted\\&quot; with bleach and is on the fine side. Straight when blown dry, wavy when air dried. I like it straight, so I blow then use a straightening iron to touch up the \\&quot;crazy\\&quot; spots. My hair has started showing signs of damage that I haven&#x27;t had to deal with before, like broken flyaways and split ends. This tamed everything down and my color looks refreshed. It isn&#x27;t heavy or oily (you don&#x27;t need much) and the scent is so nice and doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume. I would give 10 a 10![[ASIN:B002DVHTFI it&#x27;s a 10 miracle shine spray with noni oil 4 fl oz (118 ml)]]</li>
    <li> This product actually helps counter the effects of frizziness when the humidity is high. Even if your hair frizzes a little after using, a simple brushing seems to help the appearance of frizziness disappear. I love it! The texture of my hair with this product is greatly improved!</li>
    <li> This Miracle 10 products really do as they claim. I use this everyday. I have processed blonde hair and this spray makes it look so shiny and feel smooth! The scent is pleasant! Definitely repurchasing!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, not sure I would purchase it again.  It does make your hair shine but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff to use in your hair. It makes your hair shine and it makes it feel wonderful! I recommend it over anything else! Shipping is fast, and I order from them every time!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this line! Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells amazing and works great for my naturally, curly, frizzy hair. I use it when my hair is wet and before/after I use my flat iron. Leaves a great shine and does not weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s A 10 miracle shine spray with noni oil is a new favorite hair product.  It smells great and does what it&#x27;s supposed to - makes my hair shiny, soft and more manageable.  I also love the fact that it&#x27;s a decent price.  I have yet to try their other products (my stylist introduced me to this one), but I will.</li>
    <li> I love this product and highly recommend it.  I use a hot iron every day and this helps protect my hair and make it shine.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesome. But that&#x27;s about it. I guess it adds an ever so slight shine, but it will not smooth split ends nor protect them (apparently) and I looked at the ingredients and one of the major ingredients is alcohol! How is alcohol (very drying) going to HELP hair? Will not buy again...my hair is more damaged using this product than it was before I started using it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Leaves hair so soft and manageable and most of all....SHINY!!! I cant always find this particular product at the store so its nice to be able to order it online...and it arrives within a few days!! Thanks much!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite from It&#x27;s a 10. My hair is thick and wavy. Use it with It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave-in plus keratin and It&#x27;s a 10 miracle hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;Hair looks really shiny, healthy and little or no freeze. Will cut your drying time in half.</li>
    <li> best hair product ever.....love it! been using it for a while.  it makes your hair so soft and it smells good too!</li>
    <li> Nice price.  Perfect packaging and was given as gift with straightener and she loves it.</li>
    <li> love this product. its one of my favorites. I will order this again, so much cheaper than in the salons!!!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser used this product after my last hair cut and I was really impressed with the way it made my hair feel, I just had to have More!</li>
    <li> Using daily for approx 3 weeks, doesn&#x27;t appear to be any build up.  Appears to be helping my ends not be as dry after styling and daily wear and tear. I use other products in this line so I plan to buy this again and give it a couple of months to get a final opinion.</li>
    <li> I have already finished my first bottle (it lasted a good amount of time) and I am reodering. I use this as a heat protector. I am african american with relaxed straight hair and I use a curling iron or flat iron on my hair. I don&#x27;t  have a lot of bulk to my hair so heat protector sprays tend to weigh it down and or build up after the second day of use etc. I can use this every day and still have body and it protects my hair from the heat. I use the Its a 10 shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner and I like all the products.</li>
    <li> With my frizzy hair, it&#x27;s a 10 is a miracle for my hair.  It definatley calms my hair down and makes it shine!  Miracles Do happen!</li>
    <li> Not sure about this one....love the smell and the shine....but product feels a little heavier than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair pretty soft and shiny. I spray it in my hair when my hair is damp. That&#x27;s when it works the best.</li>
    <li> First order never arrived… Replacement came pretty banged up…:/ but i do love this product! It works wonders</li>
    <li> amazing!  works great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this spray.  It lifts and holds hair but still lets it swing freely--and the scent is heavenly.</li>
    <li> What can I say: I love this product! ...And I can always find the best pricing on Amazon!</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, fairly long and naturally curly. It&#x27;s also very dry and damaged from coloring with a tendency to frizz. I have a hard time making it look healthy, especially the ends. I used to use liquid oils to make it shine, but I found it difficult to get the amount just right. If I used too much it would get greasy and hang heavier, pulling my curls out. And the oils didn&#x27;t do anything for my tangles either.Then my hairdresser turned me on to this spray. Wow! I spray it on my towel-dried hair. The result is that my hair looks healthy, bouncy and shiny without frizz, grease or apparent damage. My usual tangles are gone too! I used to have several products on my bathroom counter, but this replaced them all. Needless to say, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Ok nothing to write &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; about. Same as other found in hair departments. Does not warrant the price nor deliver the results as expected.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome, gives that little extra shine to dull hair.</li>
    <li> I saw a review online that suggested it be used with a flat iron when straightening. My hair never really developed a shine from this product. It is very lightweight, but no real benefit for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I recently got my hair cut and the stylist used this spray. I get my hair cut dry, and this spray made my normally frizzy, dry hair shiny, straight and full of life! It looked amazing! All it took was 3 spritzes about about 2 minutes with a blow dryer. The salon wasn&#x27;t selling the product, so I rushed home and ordered it online! My only complaint was that it took 2 weeks to arrive, but the product itself is a miracle! Keeps me frizz free even in humid South Florida!</li>
    <li> Love love love!  Worth every penny  --- along with all their products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally found something to change my dull, lifeless, dry hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little bit brought a shine that I couldn&#x27;t believe - without weighing it down!  My hair is soft, shiny and very touchable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products, in an effort to &#x27;revive&#x27; my hair - with no luck.  After hours of research on products - I found  &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; had the best reviews, with an average of 4-5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....I took a leap of faith, and bought most of their products - all were fantastic and made a difference in my hair immediately!  Miracle shine was the topping on the cake - WOW! Just a little added a beautiful shine, smooth finish and made the flatiron glide through my hair without all the normal snags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is transformed in just a couple days!  Strongly recommend this and their entire line!  Thank you &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> My hairdresser first introduced me to this. I live near the ocean and with the high humidity I needed a product that would stop my colored hair from &#x27;frizzing&#x27;. I spay before leaving the house and it truly lasts all day. Also the shine gives a wonderful fresh healthy look. I gain complements very often. The perfume has that straight out of the saloon aroma even if my hair really needs a wash but time hadn&#x27;t allowed for that. .... I give it a big 10 as it&#x27;s name implies.</li>
    <li> This product is the best as a protectorant when using a flat iron!  Leaves hair shiny, healthy and natural looking and feeling.</li>
    <li> This product is great to make your hair shinny and looking soft! just spray a little either on wet or dry hair. You will see the difference!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it all the time but when I do it really does make my hair shine.</li>
    <li> Eh, didn&#x27;t get much of a shine, pretty pricy for such a small size.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product, makes you hair very shiny.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what the description says. A few sprays adds amazing shine to your hair. Make sure not to spray too much or you will get a greasy effect.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair very shiny and smooth plus it smells wonderful!  I get a lot of compliments on how great my hair smells (which is reason enough to buy this, in my opinion).  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used the other it&#x27;s a 10 (without the oil) and was not impressed. I have used mystic oil by loreal and have to say this product is the best! My hair is shiny and healthy looking!.</li>
    <li> Husband pleasing and makes my hair really shiny and soft.  I like the scent, too.  And the price is outrageously good here.  I paid $8 more for it at a local drug store.  Love it!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT HAD REALLY GOOD REVIEWS THAT I SAW. BECAUSE I LOVE THE ROOT BOOST SO MUCH(IT IS LIKE PERFUME FOR YOUR HAIR PLUS WORKS WELL) I DECIDED TO GIVE THE SPRAY A TRY. HOLD IS SOFT,WHICH IS OKAY FOR ME. IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME DELICIOUS SMELL THOUGH.</li>
    <li> Great product for straight hair! Tames fly away hair and leaves no heavy oily feeling on your hair. Shipped from store, as described and received very timely. Thanks, I love this product!</li>
    <li> This product does a great job of adding shine to your hair and helps detangle.  It calms down frizzies too.  It is an oil, but does not make your hair look or feel greasy (unless you use too much).  I used it a lot at the beach to protect my hair.  Its has a nice citrus smell to it.  A little goes a long way - the bottle lasted me almost 2 years.</li>
    <li> i save this for special occasions as this discolors the hair on the second day and I don&#x27;t care to shampoo daily.  But what a shine it gives when I want that extra pop!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend to others. I have course hair and it worked perfect for straightening my hair and keeping it straight throughout the day. Price is awesome compared to in stores.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SPRAY!! IT ALSO HAS A GREAT SMELL TOO!!</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift and my recipient is very pleased with it. She uses it regualr and it makes such a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really helps to manage my course hair, especially on humid days! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I brought this product, and thought it would add life and shine to my hair. Instead it made it look dry.</li>
    <li> (wife) I use this before I straighten my hair and it&#x27;s amazing!! Smells great &amp; adds perfect shine</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb!  My friend in ft lauderdale turned me on to this product. I am a curly redheaded gal and have tried a ton of great products for control, frizz, soft curls. I was amazed.  I also use this to blow my hair straight and cannot believe it worked so well compared to my selection of profession salon recommeded products.  Try it by just spraying this on your hand and running it thru your dry hair just to get a feel of how this product works.</li>
    <li> I love the other It&#x27;s a 10 products so I&#x27;m not sure why this one smelled so strange, not like the other products.  I could not stand the way my hair smelled with this on it so I gave it away.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser was using this so I got some. I really like this product. It seems to tame my frizzy hair and helps keep it smooth from flat ironing. So far all of the products in this line are great.</li>
    <li> A little on the oily side. I only spray a little on my wet hair before I blow dry. Was looking for a finishing spray and this is not it!</li>
    <li> Leaves a nice sheen to your hair as a finishing touch...I&#x27;ve used this for years and it makes my gray streaks look like highlights:-) Great product!</li>
    <li> I like all Its a 10 products</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 10 miracle shine spray is a MIRACLE. I have a straight style that I use a flat iron with and have bought and used all the different sprays. This is an 11 the best you only have to spray it once and your flat iron glides through it and makes a smooth and shiny looke. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This product came in very poor packaging.  Box was too big, each of the three spray containers were not individually wrapped, allowing them to roll around vigorously.  The lids popped off and the product spilled into the box, wasting my money and the product I ordered.  The cans were dented.  The person who packed this shipment needs a lesson in the proper way to package up contents so that do not get damaged.  I expect another replacement shipment ASAP, with the care and concern of getting these items to their destination in a safe and sound manner.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  When I flat iron, my hair turns out silky smooth and soft.  It also keeps the flat look all day even in the most humid conditions.  No small feat considering I&#x27;m in an extremely humid environment with hair that normally looks like cotton candy!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It helps control frizz. Makes my hair super shiney, looks healthy and smells kinda fruity, amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Does not leave your hair greasy but makes it shiny without weighing hair down. Also good for dry ends.Well worth the price. Best price at AMAZON.</li>
    <li> My hair has color and highlights and helps with softing my hair. I always put in before blow drying. Works the best.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I have highlighted hair and my ends get very dry when I need a trim. I spray it on my hand and wipe it across the ends and my hair looks great. When my hair needs a little touch of shine this product does the trick. The scent is fabulous also.</li>
    <li> Got to go easy with spray, makes my hair very greasy</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> I mean it does its job very well, but not as good as miracle 10 with purplish cap. I honestly don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff , always is great , seller is good to and great price</li>
    <li> Love this spray; it makes my hair silly and shiny</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do, creates a pretty shine that brings out the highlights in your hair.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and in perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. Adds shine and isn&#x27;t too heavy!</li>
    <li> Now this is my first review ever, but I have to share this.  I have thick, long and color treated hair (blonde).  My hair used to do anything I asked of it.  Then, I turned 40 something and it didn&#x27;t hold curl, was frizzy and very damaged.  I tried so many different hair cuts to layer, take off damaged parts etc.  I started using so much hair spray to hold the \\&quot;look\\&quot; desired that it didn&#x27;t look good at all.  After using the It&#x27;s a 10 Hair Mask and the Leave in Spray Conditioner (which are extremely good) I wanted to try some other products in this line.  I used the Miracle Shine Spray after drying and styling my hair (before the hair spray) and then used very little hair spray afterwards.  I was AMAZED.  My style held better than it had in years.  It is softer now than I can ever remember and holds the style.  I do reapply during the day sometimes (can&#x27;t use too much if your hair is thick).  Just spray some and sort of scrunch up.  The next day, my hair looks great still.  Also I have oily hair but this spray does not make it oily.  It makes my hair shiny, soft, and manageable.  The company of Miracle Shine Spray should somehow also list within their 10 things it does is that it holds the soft sexy style you want.  I use VERY little if any hair spray now.  It smells good too.  FYI..I bought this the first time at a salon for 19.69.  You might want to do that the first time just so you have the option of returning. But, I don&#x27;t think you will.  I also tried Sally&#x27;s \\&quot;comparable\\&quot; product in their line Miracle 7.  It&#x27;s called Shine Spray.  This is not the same in my opinion although it is more economical at 12.99.  I will not buy it again.  I will however purchase It&#x27;s a 10 Shine Spray for myself, my sisters and my friends.</li>
    <li> This product works OK..I still prefer the Chi Shine better as it is bigger and last longer also cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love this Product. Pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Terrible smell.  I couldn&#x27;t stand it after first use. I didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair, just leave a terrible smell.  I tried to return it but it is not eligible for return on Amazon. Amazon should have a warning that the item is not eligible for return before customers buy it.  If it&#x27;s your first time to buy this item, it&#x27;s a good idea to check it out at stores first.  I wish I did; now it&#x27;s go to trash.</li>
    <li> Threw out all of my other shampoo, conditioner etc... This whole line is fantastic! I never have a bad hair day anymore and can let my hair grow longer now! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Fast shipping and good price!</li>
    <li> But this just dries out my hair AND I see NO shine in it. I bought the It&#x27;s A 10 leave in conditioner with Keratin &amp; this Spray and was VERY disappointed and WON&#x27;T get it again. My hairdresser had used the regular It&#x27;s A 10 on me so I had originally bought that and it was okay then when I ran out I decided to try these two products and it makes and leave my hair dry and just awful looking. I know everyone&#x27;s hair is differnt so I won&#x27;t bad mouth this to friend&#x27;s but I personally wouldn&#x27;t use it again. I;ll stick to the Moroccan Oil shine spray and conditioner. Now THAT works !!!:):)</li>
    <li> Product is not for me as my hair has no body and this makes it softer and harder to manage.  It just goes flat on top and Ineed Height</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shine spray. This brand was recommended to me by my hair stylist. I don&#x27;t think this is the exact kind she used but it was very similar. I have very thick course hair and sometimes after blow-drying and flat-ironing my hair it seemed a little dry and dull. Now that I use this spray first I have noticed a big difference in the look and feel of my hair. It&#x27;s extra shiny now and seems very healthy. I even tried another spray product similar to this (got it as a sample) and it looked horrible. I used my It&#x27;s a 10 shine spray over it to try to fix it and it worked! This stuff is truly amazing!</li>
    <li> I have dry naturally curly hair. I use this to give extra shine after styling and before using a curling iron. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It takes away the frizzies and just adds a shine .  I never leave home without it.</li>
    <li> As expected and prompt delivery</li>
    <li> I am a licensed Cosmetologist, this is a semi-ok shine spray however this is one of It&#x27;s a 10&#x27;s lesser products. It contains alcohol so daily use can result in very dry brittle hair. This is why the shine fades fast and prodcut seems weightless and does not make your hair stick to your scalp like Olive oil sheen.</li>
    <li> It took awhile to receive the product, but I would wait forever for it. That&#x27;s how much I like it. It&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave a layer of oil on your hair. Neither does your hair look greasy. I can spray it on my hair or spray a couple of drops into the palm of my hand and then massage into my hair and style. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love both of these products help tame the frizz, been using these for years.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Adds the shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> I just Love all of the Its a 10 hair care product!!! this included.&lt;br /&gt;Ive recenlty started using this line and totally Love it!</li>
    <li> Came on time--good packaging. Have used this product in the past---love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my secret weapon to shine. I have found the best way to use this is to spray when your hair is almost completely dry, then finish your style. I have a brush dryer combo that works like a curling iron in a way, which in tandem with this spray, makes my hair amazingly shiny and smooth. It is lightweight and non-greasy. The scent is light and pleasant. I&#x27;ve been using this spray for a few years now. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and cannot imagine using anything else.</li>
    <li> I know it is good if it will ever get here! SLOW SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> This spray is GREAT if you have dry, frizzy hair.  I use it on the &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; shampooing days after I have restyled my hair -- my hair is soft, shiny and non-frizzy.  A must have.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product at my hair salon and loved the smell when my hair dresser sprayed it on my hair.  I immediately went to Amazon.com to order it (much cheaper than at salon) and I never do without it now.  I use it before blow-drying my hair.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for my hair and allows me to control and manage my hair after spraying it on.  The best part of using it is the shine it leaves in your hair -- love it!!</li>
    <li> I used the spray for a shine and it works and I am going to order some more very good product.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my hair feel. Not too heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I can&#x27;t believe that Hair Cuttery no longer sells this...o well Ill just get it from here!</li>
    <li> Good product!  It is a lightweight spray that Smells grea and does not weigh hair down. !  Good for daily use. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel! Though it&#x27;s marketed primarily as a &#x27;Miracle Shine Spray&#x27;, I find it actually makes my hair very smooth and soft as well. I also love the smell...it&#x27;s hard to describe, but it just smells clean and fresh (in my opinion). I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love every thing from them,it makes my hair smooth I have course hair I&#x27;m Italian... All there product&#x27;s work great on my hair but this company on amazon it will be about 3 weeks to mail out but worth the wait since the pricing is so good!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best hair spray I have ever used. This has restored my hair and it has been over a year since I&#x27;ve had a single split end. This spray shines, it protects, and smells great. I use this product liberally after each washing, and I am just now starting my third bottle since I started using it July 2013. Best hair product I have ever used, hands down.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying this product but I love it. I spray it on before I blow dry my hair and after I get done flat ironing my hair. Gives great shine without weighing my hair down. I would recommend this to anyone that wants that extra shine.</li>
    <li> Good price, quick ship</li>
    <li> this spray is perfect to me. I especially love the smell, but no matter how I am styling my hair I can finish it with this and it makes it shine and control my frizz without weighing it down AT ALL.  Did I mention I love the smell?</li>
    <li> makes my hair super smooth and shiny. love it.</li>
    <li> The product itself is a 5 star, but the bottles arrived completely damaged. It had extremely poor packaging and as if the bottles been thrown around several times.</li>
    <li> Adds shine and brightening.  You use it after the leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> This was a reorder. I really enjoy using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I use almost every day. It enhances my&lt;br /&gt;fine thin hair to look shiney and healthy!  The price on AMAZON is the best.  I have reordered this from Amazon many times.  The product also SMELLS Good!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> smell so good and it&#x27;s perfect I loved</li>
