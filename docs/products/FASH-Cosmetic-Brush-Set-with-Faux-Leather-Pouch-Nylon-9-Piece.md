    <li> Very nice set! I love the case it comes in! Some of the brushes are a little too soft, but overall the product is nice.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the FASH sticker is removable.  Although the bag looks kind of cheap but the brushes are really nice.</li>
    <li> I was notified to review this item and a week later I still have not received my brushes. I&#x27;m not sure of its the company or the post office but nobody can find my package. When I receive the brushes I&#x27;ll write a review about the quality.</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed. So far they seem great. It is difficult to get a lot of powder on the big brush, so I just use it for bronzer.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these brushes! Very nice quality and pretty to boot! I have these because the set I ordered my sister was so nice I had to have one too! They are the perfect size and the set contains an excellent selection of brushes that are most commonly needed. I would recommend these as a makeup must-have for everyone.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really really soft.  The only problem is that the case looks kind of cheap and the word FASH is actually just a sticker you can remove.  It&#x27;s okay, though.  It&#x27;s just a great bang for your buck.</li>

    <li> I purchased these brushes early this year based on customer reviews and price.  The brushes have held their shape and do not shed, so at this price point, I don&#x27;t think you can beat them.  I like the travel pouch, which makes it easy to take them along on trips.</li>
    <li> Brushes are not what I expected.... They are too weak n not strong at all....they feel like something from the $1 store....</li>
    <li> These brushes are decent but not anything special. They are worth the money but I would almost rather spend more to know it is much better quality. The brushes have not broken or anything and i have had them for a few months now. However, the fold up bag is very cheap so I put them in something else. They smell really weird when you get them but I washed each brush in soap in water before using any of them like you should do! They work fine and do what they are supposed to do but look for better ones!</li>
    <li> It was a very nice product for the price. The brushes are very soft and applies the makeup nicely and evenly on your face. I would definitely recommend this product. The case was colorful and fun. It says FASH on the front, but it is a sticker so you can remove it.</li>
    <li> I use this as my backup set so that I don&#x27;t lose my good Sigma brushes.  For the price, the quality is great.  The brushes are soft and feel sturdy.  The set is cute and everything seems to be as pictured.  I would purchase this set again.</li>

    <li> Nice brushes, quick delivery, good quality. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and are extremely soft. Nice covers for brushes as well as a convenient case!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes. The entire set is all you will ever need. They have nice sturdy handles, with a very pretty color. The brushes themselves are soft, but stiff. And pick up powder extremely well. They fade, blend, and glide wonderfully, and are easy to wash. If I had any complaint on these, it would be that the hairs do tend to fall out. But I have personally experienced that with every make up brush that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Quality is very plasticky and not made properly, I hate the bag it came with..I feel like this is a children&#x27;s toy.</li>
    <li> only brush i got use out of was the eyeliner brush, and the one with a comb for my eyebrows.... all the other brushes dont hold makeup or blend well.</li>
