      <li>I wear it with the suntegrity moisturizer, which is also wonderful.</li>
      <li>Awesome, awesome product!</li>
      <li>It feels great to put on!</li>
      <li>It acts like a cover-up, and it has great sunscreen protection.  </li>

      <li>Skin feels good after application.</li>
      <li>Really love this product!</li>
      <li>Love this sunscreen!</li>
      <li>Nice coverage, although can still see me.</li>
      <li>I have a light / fair olive skin</li>
      <li>My skin is tone is warm with a medium complexion acne prone and dry/sensitive and I purchased this in medium tint and WOW&amp;#34; It totally makes my skin look flawless and I also have the Skintegrity without the foundation.</li>
      <li>love the idea of this product.  </li>
      <li>Lovely sunscreen/moisturizer for combination/dry skin.</li>
      <li>I especially like how flawless my face looks in photos when I&#x27;m wearing this.</li>
      <li>it gives you a healthy tanned look.</li>
      <li>but when I wear this there is no flaking and my complexion looks better.</li>
      <li>but I do wish that it had more coverage.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love THIS.</li>
      <li>I was given a coupon code which was a nice touch towards my full size.  </li>
      <li>I have fair, dry, acne-prone skin with melasma and I am so happy I finally found a safe, natural sunscreen that is effective, doesn&#x27;t make me break out and looks great!</li>
      <li>I love the tint (I use &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; tint), and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>came in a timely manner but product is not as easy to move around on the skin.  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen goes on easily and spreads evenly.</li>
      <li>I add a little bit of mineral makeup over the top of it if I need more coverage and it layers beautifully.</li>
      <li>The product doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly now</li>
      <li>It evens out my skin tone, feels light, provides sun protection.</li>
      <li>so tried samples of light, golden light and medium and was expecting to like the medium as I prefer more color</li>
      <li>This sunscreen in a light, tinted sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Instead of being absorbed into our skin, zinc oxide sits on top and reflects UV rays.</li>
      <li>aha at night, and know that the best way to prevent photoaging and skin cancer is to use a sunscreen everyday.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen is effective and it&#x27;s very hydrating.</li>
      <li>Chem Free Sunscreen\\&quot; episode #211  ...</li>
      <li>The first time I bought this, I loved it because it blended really well and had a light feel.</li>
      <li>I have tried many natural sunscreens, and this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>in all, worth every penny since it is a moisturizer, a sunscreen, antioxidant-packed treatment, and a natural-looking light foundation.</li>
      <li>Love the ingredients and love the feeling on my face - actually the non-feeling.</li>
      <li>It looks a shiny after application but that quickly disappears.  </li>
      <li>Kind of thick but effective.</li>
      <li>so I had to order a more affordable natural sunsscreen</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for me to wear on its own, but it works well over serums and oils...</li>
      <li>I think it has just the right amount of coverage for evening out my skin tone without looking like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of makeup.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good BB cream for a long time, and this lotion really fits the bill.  </li>
      <li>If I am outside all day or vacationing in the sun, I use heavier mineral based sunscreens (CeraVe Face lotion 30 or the Body lotion 30 - both are safe, effective, but not as invisible on my skin) that are well rated by EWG and various online or magazine reviewers/</li>
      <li>Before I was using Laura Mercier&#x27;s tinted moisturizer, and though natural products have a reputation for being less effective than the ones you buy in Sephora, Suntegrity really looks and works even better!</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise I ended up purchasing a large version of the light.  </li>
      <li>When I first started using this</li>
      <li>but kudos to this woman because I love this and wish that I could afford to purchase a bigger size but</li>
      <li>At first, nothing would come out at all</li>
      <li>it ain&#x27;t pretty.</li>
      <li>I love their entire line.</li>
      <li>I like that it is a healthy alternative to similar products.</li>
      <li>This one is a pleasure - goes on smoothly, is tinted ever so slightly to even out my complexion, dries quickly to a semi-dewy - natural looking finish (I dust my t-zone with powder if it&#x27;s too shiny), and safely protects me from sun damage.</li>
      <li>I have been trying to up my sun-protection game as I near 30, and this is perfect!  </li>
      <li>In the sun exposure the product is very shiny and greasy: It can not cover the redness and it will dye your skin and the fingers very much.</li>
      <li>Much safer than the chemical/UV absorption process of non-mineral based sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The coverage is incredibly sheer and not very buildable, but if you&#x27;re looking for something natural looking this is great.</li>
      <li>High quality!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub in as well as the sunscreens that use undesirable chemicals, but none of the naturals really rubs into the skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care as much even though this one feels better than any other sunblock.</li>
      <li>No itching or allergy issues like with many other products.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really frustrated because it was PERFECT the first time I ordered it.</li>
      <li>It does settle a tiny bit in the uppermost part of under my eyes, but a quick smudge undoes this and seems to take care of it for the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>I use a moisturizer under this product, and a little neutral finishing powder on top because it is a bit shine-inducing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, and I feel like my face is really protected.</li>
      <li>My skin care regimen is pretty simple</li>
      <li>All the products lean towards yellow rather than golden but the light has just a tiny subtle hint of pink which makes it look more golden than yellow.</li>
      <li>When applying chemical free (mineral) sunscreen, you use a lot less than you would with chemical based products.</li>
      <li>It arrived separated into unusable clear oil and pigment.</li>
      <li>Looks natural.  </li>
      <li>The trick is to rub it between your fingers for a few seconds before applying to get it on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I recommend trying a couple of samples as the color is not typical.  </li>
      <li>I have to admit, not many of us men wear skin products, but seeing that I am outdoors a lot and have two kids who also need protection from the daily sun, I will not cut corners or try to save money on healthy sunscreen.</li>
      <li>So I find this sunscreen worth the money since it lasts a lot longer than the typical sunscreen we slather on and rub into our skin.</li>
      <li>And the only natural face sunscreen with zinc I have found that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores ...</li>
      <li>After trying out a few sunscreen products, I stopped right here.</li>
      <li>It has 20 percent zinc oxide, a major mineral which I have reviewed and researched all over the web and on numerous health sites.</li>
      <li>I purchased samples directly from the website for the same price as I could buy multiple samples and only pay $3 shipping.  </li>

<li> I was looking for an everyday sunscreen without cancer-causing chemicals, and found this on EWG and amazon.</li>
<li> very disappointed in the non-functional packaging and probably won&#x27;t purchase again because of it.</li>

    <li> The first time I bought this, I loved it because it blended really well and had a light feel. The second time, however, it was a complete waste of (a lot of) money. It arrived separated into unusable clear oil and pigment. Very disappointed, especially because I thought I had found such a great product.</li>
    <li> I recommend trying a couple of samples as the color is not typical.  I have a light / fair olive skin so tried samples of light, golden light and medium and was expecting to like the medium as I prefer more color but I found the medium too yellow.  It made me look jaundiced.  Much to my surprise I ended up purchasing a large version of the light.  All the products lean towards yellow rather than golden but the light has just a tiny subtle hint of pink which makes it look more golden than yellow. I purchased samples directly from the website for the same price as I could buy multiple samples and only pay $3 shipping.  I was given a coupon code which was a nice touch towards my full size.  It looks a shiny after application but that quickly disappears.  I am 50+ so am obviously not encountering any problems with acne and like the moisture but do not find it greasy at all.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by it. Will not put anything else on her face. Me? I don&#x27;t care as much even though this one feels better than any other sunblock.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an everyday sunscreen without cancer-causing chemicals, and found this on EWG and amazon. It evens out my skin tone, feels light, provides sun protection.</li>
    <li> This tinted moisturizer is the only makeup I can wear-I&#x27;m allergic to everything else.  I wear it with the suntegrity moisturizer, which is also wonderful.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product is  very greasy. The non-existence of titanium dioxide is unacceptable and disappointing  for very sensitive  skin especially and after laser  treatments. In the sun exposure the product is very shiny and greasy: It can not cover the redness and it will dye your skin and the fingers very much. It must be reformulated.</li>
    <li> love the idea of this product.  came in a timely manner but product is not as easy to move around on the skin.  I like that it is a healthy alternative to similar products.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love THIS. My skin is tone is warm with a medium complexion acne prone and dry/sensitive and I purchased this in medium tint and WOW&amp;#34; It totally makes my skin look flawless and I also have the Skintegrity without the foundation. When I first started using this I thought it doesn&#x27;t work because of the dryness but when I wear this there is no flaking and my complexion looks better. My skin care regimen is pretty simple I wash with olive oil because of the dryness. It&#x27;s pricey so I had to order a more affordable natural sunsscreen but kudos to this woman because I love this and wish that I could afford to purchase a bigger size but 40 dollars is not in my price range.</li>
    <li> Really love this product!</li>
    <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as Dr. Neal Schultz from dermtv explains in the video \\&quot;How to Apply Chem Free Sunscreen\\&quot; episode #211  ...When applying chemical free (mineral) sunscreen, you use a lot less than you would with chemical based products. So I find this sunscreen worth the money since it lasts a lot longer than the typical sunscreen we slather on and rub into our skin. Instead of being absorbed into our skin, zinc oxide sits on top and reflects UV rays. Much safer than the chemical/UV absorption process of non-mineral based sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;I am almost 50, use retinoid or aha at night, and know that the best way to prevent photoaging and skin cancer is to use a sunscreen everyday. This one is a pleasure - goes on smoothly, is tinted ever so slightly to even out my complexion, dries quickly to a semi-dewy - natural looking finish (I dust my t-zone with powder if it&#x27;s too shiny), and safely protects me from sun damage. If I am outside all day or vacationing in the sun, I use heavier mineral based sunscreens (CeraVe Face lotion 30 or the Body lotion 30 - both are safe, effective, but not as invisible on my skin) that are well rated by EWG and various online or magazine reviewers/researchers.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, worth every penny since it is a moisturizer, a sunscreen, antioxidant-packed treatment, and a natural-looking light foundation. Hope you like it - I&#x27;ve seen skin cancer up close - it ain&#x27;t pretty. Protect your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: zinc oxide has calming, anti-inflammatory properties so people with rosacea or with acne may find this sunscreen extra helpful! There&#x27;s an untinted version if you are someone who doesn&#x27;t want the foundation element. And last time I looked, Suntegrity website has samples for sale to try before you buy.</li>
    <li> I love their entire line. Especially the tinted face sunscreen. High quality! Can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good BB cream for a long time, and this lotion really fits the bill.  It acts like a cover-up, and it has great sunscreen protection.  I love the tint (I use &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; tint), and it goes on smoothly.  The trick is to rub it between your fingers for a few seconds before applying to get it on smoothly.  It&#x27;s not heavy, and I feel like my face is really protected.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, not many of us men wear skin products, but seeing that I am outdoors a lot and have two kids who also need protection from the daily sun, I will not cut corners or try to save money on healthy sunscreen. After trying out a few sunscreen products, I stopped right here. This product rocks and it gives you a healthy tanned look. Men pay attention, women look twice ! It has 20 percent zinc oxide, a major mineral which I have reviewed and researched all over the web and on numerous health sites. Zinc is the answer and Suntegrity delivers, Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased the tinted version of this product. I was 110% satisfied the first time around, but I was really disappointed to find that the pump busted within two weeks of receiving my second order. At first, nothing would come out at all and there was no way to get the product out. Then it started somewhat working again but there seems to be something wrong because now when I dispense some onto my fingertips, I also get a bunch of clear oil that runs all over the place. It&#x27;s as if the pump is designed to blend in the oil before dispensing and now it is not doing that. The product doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly now and I&#x27;m really frustrated because it was PERFECT the first time I ordered it. All I had to do for my minimal daily makeup routine was use my tinted Suntegrity and then touch up with some mineral makeup as needed.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen! EWG 1 rated and I use it in place of foundation!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to up my sun-protection game as I near 30, and this is perfect!  It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for me to wear on its own, but it works well over serums and oils... doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it also doesn&#x27;t ever look greasy in the summer heat!  Before I was using Laura Mercier&#x27;s tinted moisturizer, and though natural products have a reputation for being less effective than the ones you buy in Sephora, Suntegrity really looks and works even better!</li>
    <li> The pump stopped working after a week of use… As for the moisturizer itself- Lovely sunscreen/moisturizer for combination/dry skin. I think it would probably get a bit greasy if you&#x27;re oily. The sunscreen is effective and it&#x27;s very hydrating. It feels great to put on! The coverage is incredibly sheer and not very buildable, but if you&#x27;re looking for something natural looking this is great. I add a little bit of mineral makeup over the top of it if I need more coverage and it layers beautifully. It does settle a tiny bit in the uppermost part of under my eyes, but a quick smudge undoes this and seems to take care of it for the rest of the day. Gives you a subtle, natural glow and no whitish glare despite being a mineral sunscreen. Such a shame that the pump broke so soon! Overall I&lt;br /&gt;m very disappointed in the non-functional packaging and probably won&#x27;t purchase again because of it. For such an expensive BB cream that is totally unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Kind of thick but effective.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen in a light, tinted sunscreen. It is not a foundation/bb cream. It leaves a bit of a shiny dew on your face. I tried it without lotion, but it was not moisturizing enough. I do like it but I do wish that it had more coverage.</li>
    <li> I have fair, dry, acne-prone skin with melasma and I am so happy I finally found a safe, natural sunscreen that is effective, doesn&#x27;t make me break out and looks great! I use a moisturizer under this product, and a little neutral finishing powder on top because it is a bit shine-inducing. I think it has just the right amount of coverage for evening out my skin tone without looking like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of makeup. I especially like how flawless my face looks in photos when I&#x27;m wearing this. And I wore it all summer with little exacerbation of my melasma, which gets darker with the tiniest amount of sun exposure. Awesome, awesome product! And the only natural face sunscreen with zinc I have found that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores ...</li>
    <li> This sunscreen goes on easily and spreads evenly. Skin feels good after application. No itching or allergy issues like with many other products.</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients and love the feeling on my face - actually the non-feeling. Don&#x27;t even know I have it on. Nice coverage, although can still see me. I&#x27;m more of a nature girl anyway, so perfect!</li>
    <li> Looks natural.  Other natural sunscreens leave a whitish hue on my skin&#x27;s surface, but since this one is tinted, it doesn&#x27;t.  I have tried many natural sunscreens, and this is my favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t rub in as well as the sunscreens that use undesirable chemicals, but none of the naturals really rubs into the skin.</li>
    <li> Improvement over the non-tinted sunscreen for faces because it&#x27;s not white.  But it is not a replacement for foundation.  It is a bit oily.</li>
</ol>
