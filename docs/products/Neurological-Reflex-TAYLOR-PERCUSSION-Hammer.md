### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect buying experience.</li>
      <li>good, every thing very good.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>good hammer for the price</li>
      <li>Good for what it&#x27;s meant to do.  </li>
      <li>If your office/clinic hammers tend to &#x27;walk off&#x27;, then this is a good buy.</li>
      <li>Otherwise timely shipping, good quality.</li>
      <li>This reflex hammer works well because it is easy to hold, has a good pendulum swing, and the bottom is good for using to elicit the Babenski reflex.</li>
      <li>I think this was okay.</li>
      <li>The handle also has a nice, tapered edge which is useful for myofascial work.</li>
      <li>It is fine.</li>
      <li>Cheap quality, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>Smells like an old eraser and was beat up when I received it, but the triangle is symetrical and the density of the rubber is good for eliciting reflexes.</li>
      <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
      <li>love the red color of the hammer.  </li>
      <li>When I start residency I may upgrade, but this is better than the last one I had.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for around 3 dollars.</li>
      <li>A classic story.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is definitely a decent reflex hammer, particularly for the price.</li>
      <li>Although others are nicer, this is a good reflex hammer for a poor veterinary student.</li>
      <li>The hammer arrived very quickly however the red color from the rubber material has shed and turned my shirt red</li>
      <li>(though it&#x27;s easily brushed off and certainly hasn&#x27;t dyed my clothes).</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, basic hammer, no problems.</li>
      <li>There are not really many exciting things to say about it, except that it seems durable and works well.  </li>

    <li> This reflex hammer works well because it is easy to hold, has a good pendulum swing, and the bottom is good for using to elicit the Babenski reflex. Although others are nicer, this is a good reflex hammer for a poor veterinary student.</li>
    <li> This reflex hammer has worked well for me in my clinical practice.  There are not really many exciting things to say about it, except that it seems durable and works well.  Fits well in the pocket.</li>
    <li> good, every thing very good.  Es lo que esperaba,tambien fue enviado en el lapso prometido.  Considero que es una buena opcioon para comprar</li>
    <li> Works well and you cannot beat this item for less than three dollars! Would purchase again in a heartbeat.  When I start residency I may upgrade, but this is better than the last one I had.  It is sharp enough to use for babinski too.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to.  Be careful, though, because the color from the rubber head will bleed.</li>
    <li> The hammer arrived very quickly however the red color from the rubber material has shed and turned my shirt red (though it&#x27;s easily brushed off and certainly hasn&#x27;t dyed my clothes).</li>
    <li> I think there&#x27;s the neurological one... I think this was okay. I used it on my classmates.</li>
    <li> Well made and seem to last long.</li>

    <li> Perfect buying experience. Product exactly as described.</li>
    <li> It works as expected.  Man whacks patient&#x27;s knee.  Patient kicks man in groin.  A classic story.&lt;br /&gt;I love the red color of the hammer.  People know I mean business when I whip that thing out.</li>
    <li> This was not the hammer I ordered, but it was the one I received and after weeks of waiting, I don&#x27;t have the time to send it back.  It is fine. Very basic.</li>
    <li> Pictured reflex hammer had a pin to hold the rubber head in place.  Actual hammer received did not have the pin.  I would not have ordered if I knew it did not have the pin to hold the head in place.  Otherwise timely shipping, good quality.</li>
    <li> I needed a reflex hammer for school, it does the trick.  The bottom can double to test babinski reflex also.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality, but you can&#x27;t beat the price. If your office/clinic hammers tend to &#x27;walk off&#x27;, then this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> Good for what it&#x27;s meant to do.  A little hard to use on yourself. Just bought it to satisfy a concern.</li>
    <li> good hammer for the price</li>
    <li> Smells like an old eraser and was beat up when I received it, but the triangle is symetrical and the density of the rubber is good for eliciting reflexes. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for around 3 dollars.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a decent reflex hammer, particularly for the price. The handle also has a nice, tapered edge which is useful for myofascial work.</li>
