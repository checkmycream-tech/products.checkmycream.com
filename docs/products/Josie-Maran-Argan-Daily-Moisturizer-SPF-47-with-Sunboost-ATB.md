      <li>It leaves my skin so soft and the spf protection is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with getting a sunburn, and I have very fair skin and live in Houston, TX where we have more sun exposure than up north.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>I love the Josie Maran Sun Protection</li>
      <li>This is just lovely.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Argan oil is safe for my skin, though some people don&#x27;t fare well with it.</li>
      <li>This is a nice light moisturizer but it&#x27;s tinted.  </li>
      <li>The best physical sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>#34;we wanted to make it more hydrating.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m all for hydration</li>
      <li>This one may be my favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, easy to wear under makeup or alone, has safe sunscreen, and it gives myh face a radiant apricot glow.  </li>
      <li>This formula rubs in easily without being oily, sticky, or filmy.</li>
      <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the strong synthetic fragrance .</li>
      <li>Itlooks fine on me.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell at all like sunscreen, and that&#x27;s a huge pull for me.</li>
      <li>Josie Maran&#x27;s has several great qualities.</li>
      <li>And honestly, after just a few days of using it I noticed my skin looking more even-toned and bright -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s practically odorless, with a light soap-smell that fades.</li>
      <li>So, if you want your moisturizer tint free, don&#x27;t purchase this product.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s like a light, almost applesauce-smelling scent.</li>
      <li>For oilier skin, like mine, her original version is sufficient.</li>
      <li>so now I order the full sizes of them</li>
      <li>is totally the best ever moisturizer I have ever used, actually my daughterinlaw sent me a set of the face oil, moisturizerzeand</li>
      <li>I am an extremely fair skinned redhead, and like many redheads, I have very sensitive skin and several allergies and chemical sensitivities.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t accurately describe just how much I dislike this product!</li>
      <li>I have dry, fair skin that flakes even in the tropics, so I need a thicker moisturizer -</li>
      <li>think that if you have dry skin, this is a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It is smooth, yet soaks right in (I have super oily skin), leaves no residue (in the Florida summer however, I have to add a bit of Smashbox Primer) and generally leaves your skin just glowing healthy.  </li>
      <li>It comes out bright white, but once you rub it in (which it does easily) it is really transparent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I found a sunscreen/moisturizer that I actually LIKE and don&#x27;t mind applying daily.</li>
      <li>I actually really like it!</li>
      <li>It seems greasy at first but it does absorb and works well under foundation .</li>
      <li>Getting the larger, 4 oz bottle is a better deal, and I buy it from Saphora for the rewards.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a medium olive complexion so at first I was like &amp;</li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>Some reviews mention that it doesn&#x27;t exactly soak into the skin, and I can see that.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very sheer and will work well once blended with most skin tones.</li>
      <li>They say &amp;#34;super moisturizing&amp;#34; but it honestly is so greasy and it never really soaks in.</li>
      <li>I love Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil and have used it as a deep moisturizer for a couple of years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the only thing that could get out the stains is a super-powerful bleach, but if you&#x27;re ordering this product, you probably care about avoiding bleach.</li>
      <li>The product is in fact oily but, my skin absorbs it n very quickly and my face is never actually oily afterwards.</li>
      <li>Several people said my skin looks great within the first few weeks of using this.</li>
      <li>It is also very drying.</li>
      <li>(Maybe I&#x27;m using too much.)</li>
      <li>I was really hoping that this would help minimize my pores, but after four months of use, I haven&#x27;t seen them diminish.</li>
      <li>every morning we apply this thin lotion, great sun protection and no skin reactions.</li>
      <li>It was much heavier than Josie Maran&#x27;s liquid.)</li>
      <li>but I really like this lotion.</li>
      <li>I really liked it except it left that zombiesque white film all over my face.</li>
      <li>It was way too thick and cakey, not as nice and silky is the other kind.</li>
      <li>A little thicker than I expected but still looks great when mixed with foundation and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>The other reason I gave it one less star is because I wish it had more zinc than titanium and more antioxidants/nutrients.     </li>
      <li>Unlike so many sunscreens, Josie Maran&#x27;s argan daily moisturizer SPF 47 really blends into skin without leaving a white filmy cast to your skin.</li>
      <li>The high SPF, the natural and cruelty-free ingredients, and the very reasonable price make this a quality product for me.</li>
      <li>I think that you have to give up a lot with SPF moisturizers as far as consistency, smell, and not irritating your skin.</li>
      <li>I believe I have normal skin, but some products make me break out.</li>
      <li>Again, I live in Houston, which is below sea level and therefore has a very high humidity index, so naturally my skin is always going to be a bit dewier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this at Sephora on sale, after reading the 100s of reviews, mostly complaints that the new formula is a step down from the old.</li>
      <li>I think this newer version (w/sunboost) is a bit richer than the original version, so I would recommend this one for mature or dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Before switching to Josie Maran, I used Shiseido Sun Protection Eye Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 34 for my whole face.</li>
      <li>With an SPF that high, it&#x27;s bound to be a little more like general sunscreen than makeup-specific sunscreen.</li>
      <li>First it is tinted a deep orange color.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive dry skin and mild rosacea.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a plus, even if it doesn&#x27;t enhance clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t speak to the old formula because I never tried it</li>
      <li>The tinted nature gets into every crease of your face, accentuating any line however tiny, no matter how much you rub it in.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin but haven&#x27;t reacted to this.</li>
      <li>I would suggest the product to anyone looking for a daily moisturizer with real sun protection.</li>
      <li>I can say that it does go on thick, with a distinct sunscreen-y feel, but that fades almost instantly as it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all mineral based, doesn&#x27;t give you a white cast, and it&#x27;s liquid (instead of cream or paste), so it&#x27;s easy to apply even on the ears and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m new to the product, I can&#x27;t speak to the recent change.</li>
      <li>So when I was looking for a new facial sunscreen, I was intrigued by this product since it included a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled finding a moisturizer that is more than approximately SPF 20 and doesn&#x27;t have the smell of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
      <li>It does absorb a bit, but it usually isn&#x27;t until I put my finishing powder on that I feel a bit more matte and less of that soft, ultra silky feeling.</li>
      <li>(I look like a dead person without a bit of colour on my cheeks--NARS multiple sticks are my favourites--orgasm for a natural look and puerta vallarta for a peachy bronzed look) For heavy duty sunscreen at the pool or beach, I love Shiseido&#x27;s wetforce SPF 50.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used to use the non-tinted Josie Maran moisturizer and thought I would give this a try. It was way too thick and cakey, not as nice and silky is the other kind.</li>
    <li> A winter must! I need a heavier moisturizer in the colder months and I am a big fan of all Josie Maran products. This one may be my favorite. Several people said my skin looks great within the first few weeks of using this. I can see how people with oily skin may feel this is a bit too heavy but my dry skin sucks this right up and it feels great.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this has been the Best moisturizer for my skin. I use the oil at night! Love this products!!!</li>
    <li> The best physical sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s light, easy to wear under makeup or alone, has safe sunscreen, and it gives myh face a radiant apricot glow.  I&#x27;ve bought it 4x already, and I&#x27;ve ever regularly used any other brand of sunscreen.  This will be my staple as long as it&#x27;s around!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t speak to the old formula because I never tried it but I really like this lotion. It seems greasy at first but it does absorb and works well under foundation . The description doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s tinted which is kinda weird but I have a feeling if it wasn&#x27;t it would have the dreaded white cast of a mineral sunscreen ! It&#x27;s kinda pinky, peachy but it&#x27;s very sheer and will work well once blended with most skin tones. I&#x27;m a medium olive complexion so at first I was like &amp;#34;oh no it&#x27;s too pink&amp;#34; when I have yellow/golden undertones ... Itlooks fine on me. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the strong synthetic fragrance . It&#x27;s a shame because Josie&#x27;s whole platform is natural beauty but a lot of her body products like creams and lotions have fake fragrance . It&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me tho !</li>
    <li> Was just disappointed it wasn&#x27;t tinted.</li>
    <li> I like the moisturizer and apply with a bit of water. Takes a minute to go in, but then the skin looks moist, and can apply powder make up. I do not like the tinted version which looks great but comes off on clothes and tissues, even at the end of the day. It does a good job at coverage however.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it enough for an opinion as yet</li>
    <li> I am an extremely fair skinned redhead, and like many redheads, I have very sensitive skin and several allergies and chemical sensitivities. I also have incredibly dry skin. I love Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil and have used it as a deep moisturizer for a couple of years. So when I was looking for a new facial sunscreen, I was intrigued by this product since it included a moisturizer. This formula rubs in easily without being oily, sticky, or filmy. Unlike so many sunscreens, Josie Maran&#x27;s argan daily moisturizer SPF 47 really blends into skin without leaving a white filmy cast to your skin. This sunscreen/moisturizer can be used by itself--you don&#x27;t have to cover it with foundation or bronzer/blush to hide your white zombie like skintone. I often just apply this sunscreen/moisturizer then use a little mascara, eyeshadow, lipgloss, and a wee little bit of cream blush (I look like a dead person without a bit of colour on my cheeks--NARS multiple sticks are my favourites--orgasm for a natural look and puerta vallarta for a peachy bronzed look) For heavy duty sunscreen at the pool or beach, I love Shiseido&#x27;s wetforce SPF 50. Before switching to Josie Maran, I used Shiseido Sun Protection Eye Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 34 for my whole face. I really liked it except it left that zombiesque white film all over my face. I don&#x27;t need to look any paler. I&#x27;m so happy that I found a sunscreen/moisturizer that I actually LIKE and don&#x27;t mind applying daily.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It leaves my skin so soft and the spf protection is wonderful.  Truly an amazing product. I love it!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) The smell. I actually really like it! I know that not everyone likes the smell of it but it&#x27;s like a light, almost applesauce-smelling scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell at all like sunscreen, and that&#x27;s a huge pull for me. I&#x27;ve struggled finding a moisturizer that is more than approximately SPF 20 and doesn&#x27;t have the smell of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;2) Coverage. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with getting a sunburn, and I have very fair skin and live in Houston, TX where we have more sun exposure than up north.&lt;br /&gt;3) No irritation. My breakouts are not any worse. They&#x27;re not better, but they&#x27;re not worse. I think that you have to give up a lot with SPF moisturizers as far as consistency, smell, and not irritating your skin. This isn&#x27;t too thick or goopy, and doesn&#x27;t break me out. That&#x27;s a plus, even if it doesn&#x27;t enhance clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Pores. I was really hoping that this would help minimize my pores, but after four months of use, I haven&#x27;t seen them diminish. I have used my Josie Maran Argan Oil every so often but not enough to see if there&#x27;s improvement. With the moisturizer alone, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements.&lt;br /&gt;2) Absorbency. Some reviews mention that it doesn&#x27;t exactly soak into the skin, and I can see that. I tested this before writing this review, and let it sit on my skin for ten minutes without putting on my next layer of makeup. It does absorb a bit, but it usually isn&#x27;t until I put my finishing powder on that I feel a bit more matte and less of that soft, ultra silky feeling. Again, I live in Houston, which is below sea level and therefore has a very high humidity index, so naturally my skin is always going to be a bit dewier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you buy?&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you have dry skin, this is a good moisturizer. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt sensitive skin, and I have extremely sensitive skin that reacts badly to almost all drugstore brands. This is good for a lot of skin types, but I would stay away if you have overly-oily skin. It lasts a long time too, even though it looks small, so you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!long time too, even though it looks small, so you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>

And honestly, after just a few days of using it I noticed my skin looking more even-toned and bright - while the argan oil wasn&#x27;t an attractor for me when opting for Josie Maran, maybe there&#x27;s something to it after all. I have dry, fair skin that flakes even in the tropics, so I need a thicker moisturizer - if you have oily or combination skin, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. The high SPF, the natural and cruelty-free ingredients, and the very reasonable price make this a quality product for me.</li>
    <li> This is just lovely. It goes on smooth, makes my face look nicer afterwards, and the sunscreen does a great job standing up to the California sun.</li>
    <li> Post-shower every morning we apply this thin lotion, great sun protection and no skin reactions. I would suggest the product to anyone looking for a daily moisturizer with real sun protection.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light moisturizer but it&#x27;s tinted.  Not sure why that&#x27;s not in the description? I also think it would be a bit creamier for being a Josie Maran argan oil product. A tad over priced for the size also. Wish I would have gone for a different product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Josie Maran moisturizer with SPF for YEARS! They recently change their formulation and let me tell you - it&#x27;s TERRIBLE. It&#x27;s so greasy. After using their &amp;#34;new and improved formula&amp;#34; for 4 days, I broke out so badly I had to stop using it. I am so disappointed that they changed their product. I wrote the company and they said &amp;#34;we wanted to make it more hydrating.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m all for hydration but I&#x27;m not happy that it makes my face look like an oil slick. I had to return my bottle and and am currently looking for another product. I would suggest testing this out somewhere before you buy it. They say &amp;#34;super moisturizing&amp;#34; but it honestly is so greasy and it never really soaks in. Very very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I hate it. First it is tinted a deep orange color. This is not indicated on the label. It is also very drying. You cannot use it in the daytime because is is so tinted and an fair skin, orange is the worst color to cover. It has SPF so useless @ night. You would still need to use a moisturizer in order to use this.</li>
    <li> Not easy to find a physical sunscreen that isn&#x27;t drying but I have found that in josie Moran spf 47. It does leave a shine on the skin but just pat it if it bothers you. I have sensitive skin but haven&#x27;t reacted to this. I can also use it for my eye area without any irritation. Love it!    I was reading some of the reviews where people compained it was tinted which is very odd, as it isn&#x27;t tinted at all.  And when you spread it on your face there is a slight hint of white but it disappears.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer since Josie Maran came into the Beauty Market and it is the best moisturizer with SPF. It is smooth, yet soaks right in (I have super oily skin), leaves no residue (in the Florida summer however, I have to add a bit of Smashbox Primer) and generally leaves your skin just glowing healthy.  I think this newer version (w/sunboost) is a bit richer than the original version, so I would recommend this one for mature or dry skin.  For oilier skin, like mine, her original version is sufficient. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> is totally the best ever moisturizer I have ever used, actually my daughterinlaw sent me a set of the face oil, moisturizerzeand the argon Oil and that&#x27;s how I got started so now I order the full sizes of them</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed for discover that this product was TINTED!  No where in the description does this product tell me it was tinted! I hate the tint and do not ever wear foundation so the tint ruined the product for me.  I have used Josie Maran Argan Moisturizer before and loved, loved, loved it but it DID NOT have a tint.  So, if you want your moisturizer tint free, don&#x27;t purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I love the Josie Maran Sun Protection but no where in the order did it say this one was tinted. Was very unhappy with order as I purchased it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a daily moisturizer that won&#x27;t make me break out and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of questionable chemicals. Josie Maran&#x27;s has several great qualities. It&#x27;s all mineral based, doesn&#x27;t give you a white cast, and it&#x27;s liquid (instead of cream or paste), so it&#x27;s easy to apply even on the ears and isn&#x27;t heavy. It comes out bright white, but once you rub it in (which it does easily) it is really transparent. It&#x27;s practically odorless, with a light soap-smell that fades. I believe I have normal skin, but some products make me break out. Argan oil is safe for my skin, though some people don&#x27;t fare well with it. This product has replaced my Mychelle Solar Defense because that made me break out (I suspect the algae was at fault since it is a known comedogenic or maybe it was the paste like quality. It was much heavier than Josie Maran&#x27;s liquid.) If you&#x27;re worried about breakouts, they do have a 0.5 oz for a test run. This new formula got a Best rating from Paula Begoun.    I gave it four stars because of the price for amount, since it takes 2-3 pumps to cover my face and another to 1-2 for my neck. (Maybe I&#x27;m using too much.) Getting the larger, 4 oz bottle is a better deal, and I buy it from Saphora for the rewards. The other reason I gave it one less star is because I wish it had more zinc than titanium and more antioxidants/nutrients.     FYI: The ATB stands for Aloe, Tocopherol (aka vit. E), and Bisabolol.)</li>
    <li> did not like the tint in it...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely not the same formula as in the past. A little thick and sticky, hard to rub in. But it does the trick. Not sure I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
    <li> This product works great for me. I have sensitive dry skin and mild rosacea. The product is in fact oily but, my skin absorbs it n very quickly and my face is never actually oily afterwards. I like that it is tinted because it covers some skin imperfections. It&#x27;s a 3-in-1 product!</li>
    <li> A little thicker than I expected but still looks great when mixed with foundation and goes on smoothly. With an SPF that high, it&#x27;s bound to be a little more like general sunscreen than makeup-specific sunscreen. Wore it on my face out in the desert from 9 AM to 2 PM in 110 degree heat and didn&#x27;t get burned at all!!</li>
    <li> Only now that I am writing this review do I realize I received the wrong product. I received the &amp;#34;Protect + Perfect&amp;#34; version, which is tinted, and I had ordered the basic Josie Maran moisturizer, which is shown here (and which I LOVE).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Protect + Perfect&amp;#34; version, which you will most likely receive if you order from this Seller, is absolutely horrible. The tinted nature gets into every crease of your face, accentuating any line however tiny, no matter how much you rub it in. It also appears like a self-tanner -- way too dark for my skin, and I&#x27;m not *that* pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute WORST part about this product, which is driving me to write a review, is that it stains EVERYTHING. It has stained the neckline of my shirts, my robe, my towels, and my sheets. I&#x27;m sure the only thing that could get out the stains is a super-powerful bleach, but if you&#x27;re ordering this product, you probably care about avoiding bleach. ;)  So now I have what looks like make-up stains on my nice clothing and sheets. I can&#x27;t accurately describe just how much I dislike this product!</li>
    <li> The title does not indicate tinted. Well, it&#x27;s tinted and I think its bad product the smell- old lady makeup. I have only myself to blame for not scrolling and just buying. Also, the customer service is odious. I should have gone to Sephora.</li>
