      <li>It is great.</li>
      <li>It is great for when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend maintaining and changing your polish.</li>
      <li>I bought it because someone said it was great under Jamberry nail wraps.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s good to have for that.</li>
      <li>I heard this was good</li>
      <li>Good quality</li>
      <li>It looks good, even today.  </li>
      <li>fork.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I fell in love with it!  </li>
      <li>so amazon is awesome when it comes to purchasing certain products that you can not find anywhere else.</li>
      <li>THAT BEING SAID - this is an amazing basecoat.</li>
      <li>I liked it so well</li>
      <li>, I had to buy my own.  </li>
      <li>Nail platinum became strong!</li>
      <li>I finally bought something incredibly great!  </li>
      <li>Great product that really works.  </li>
      <li>stuff is like magic.</li>
      <li>Orly calls it &amp;#34;Double back tape&amp;#34;, perfect reference!</li>
      <li>but I got a light orange one.</li>
      <li>so this is really worth it!  </li>
      <li>I feel like my nails grow so much faster, and I have no chipping that I used to get at the top of the nail.  </li>
      <li>Love, your manicure lasts so much longer.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t exactly buy the greatest quality nail polish, so it&#x27;s important to have a great base coat.</li>
      <li>They actually have a very potent chemical in their polishes called dibutyl phthalate.    </li>
      <li>This is way better than the clear coat I&#x27;ve been using that flakes away in a couple of days.</li>
      <li>100% worth the money.</li>
      <li>My nails look healthier and they have a more natural sheen.  </li>
      <li>It dries quick and works really well.</li>
      <li>This allows the next coat of polish to adhere more thoroughly, extending the life of one&#x27;s manicure.</li>
      <li>You have to get pretty close to the nail to see the staining.</li>
      <li>This works really well for me!</li>
      <li>I do use it consistently and will update this post if I see improvement in the coming months.</li>
      <li>but I got chipping within 3 days even when using the entire Orly system, including &amp;#34;In a Snap&amp;#34; top coat and Orly Color.</li>
      <li>My manicure definitely feels like it&#x27;s going to be sticking around for a while :)</li>
      <li>It helps my nail polish apply smoothly and has prevent my nails from being stained yellow.</li>
      <li>This stuff really does work for keeping polish on longer.</li>
      <li>The price makes it very affordable.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>My polish lasts twice as long on my nails as without the basecoat, and it takes forever to chip while still being as easy to remove as ever.    </li>
      <li>I definitely think this product is worth the money and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
      <li>It really makes nail polish last about 5 day&#x27;s and that to me is incredible, most nail polish with the other chip polish and similar product&#x27;s only had them last a day or 2</li>
      <li>I am really particular about my nails.</li>
      <li>I tried this product after reading a few articles online concerning strategies for getting better results from home manicures.</li>
      <li>When I pair it with the Orly Sec &#x27;N Dry Quick Dry top coat, my nails dry super fast and the polish lasts quite a while!  </li>
      <li>I began using a clear polish about 3 years ago because I noticed my nails splitting, with ridges and crack lines along the nail&#x27;s length.  </li>
      <li>It does take a bit of extra scrubbing to remove but that&#x27;s the whole point; to be resistant and durable.</li>
      <li>Regardless of the peeling or not, my nails are so much healthier after using it regularly.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this, (these), products for use by men or women who want a natural, neat appearance for their hands.</li>
      <li>I have only used it on my toes since I do not paint my fingernails very often.</li>
      <li>The best base coat I have ever used.</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE BEST BASE FOR NAIL POLISH....</li>
      <li>this is the best base coat.  </li>
      <li>Really makes a difference in how long my polish lasts!</li>

<li> THIS IS THE BEST BASE FOR NAIL POLISH....</li>
<li> this is the best base coat.  </li>
<li> Really makes a difference in how long my polish lasts!</li>
<li> Which is a really long time for me because I am constantly using antibacterial foam on my hand and washing them constantly.  </li>
<li> For Males flat coat polish.  </li>
<li> This Orly Bonder is the most lightweight base coat I&#x27;ve ever used, so it dries quickly, and as advertised, it has a slight (and intentional) roughness to the finish.</li>
<li> Seeing only a limited, if any, benefit of using it.  </li>
<li> Takes way too long to dry before you can put on your nail color</li>
<li> I feel like when I have waited a little longer before I applied the second and third coat</li>
<li> My suggestion when using it: do not wait for the polish to dry before applying the color coat.  </li>
<li> I use it as a base coat, 2 coats of nail polish and a clear top coat.  </li>
<li> I own several nail base coats &amp; this one</li>
<li> Indeed, it does seem that my manicures are lasting a day or two longer than previously.</li>
<li> Orly Bonder Base Coat provides a nice rubberized texture that allow all nail polishes to adhere to it.</li>
<li> The smell is not as offensive as other polishes.</li>
<li> When using this, my pedicure lasts for up to three weeks with very minimal chipping.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it does stain my nails a bit with an orange/yellow tint</li>
<li> Not really worth it if there is something else.</li>
<li> I bought this after I saw that r/Laqueristas (on Reddit) had voted it their favorite base coat (by a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but many nail polishes do that when used without a base coat and will eventually grow out.</li>
<li> Much better than the Revlon Base Coat I had been using, which although was rubbery, didn&#x27;t help preventing staining.</li>
<li> Love this base coat.</li>
<li> my nails have developed some damage that i&#x27;m very unhappy with due to the chemicals contained in this product, but it really is such a good base.</li>
<li> The bottle on this picture loss like a pale pink</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> My manicures lasted a few days to a week longer than usual.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, either as a double-dose of clear base coating with no additional polish, or as a single base-coat underneath colored polishes.</li>
<li> A little thick</li>
<li> but it had very little smell.</li>
<li> I love this base coat!</li>
<li> I actually learned just last week that Orly nail polish actually one of the worst companies out there</li>
<li> Usually after a couple of days the corners of my square nails chip.</li>
<li> My favorite base coat!</li>
<li> This product I have used before in the past 2 months.  </li>
<li> The Polish didn&#x27;t last any longer than regular Base  coats</li>
<li> Fantastic base coat!  </li>
<li> I became concerned that my nails were thinning and that I would have terrible issues with their appearance in the future, but I have always felt self conscious about the shine.  </li>
<li> i just hate getting left with bumpy, damaged nails :/</li>
<li> Not only does my nail polish stay on for at least 4 days, but my nails are infinitely stronger ever since I started using this base coat.  </li>
<li> I am absolutely sold on this base polish!</li>

    <li> This stuff really does work for keeping polish on longer.</li>
    <li> My favorite base coat!</li>
    <li> Nail platinum became strong!</li>
    <li> Love, your manicure lasts so much longer.</li>
    <li> Fantastic base coat!  This is one of the only base coats I have used that doesn&#x27;t leave bubbles in my polish.  When I pair it with the Orly Sec &#x27;N Dry Quick Dry top coat, my nails dry super fast and the polish lasts quite a while!  I will totally buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Excellent service ... Good quality fork.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend seller</li>
    <li> Dries quickly but I got chipping within 3 days even when using the entire Orly system, including &amp;#34;In a Snap&amp;#34; top coat and Orly Color.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I saw that r/Laqueristas (on Reddit) had voted it their favorite base coat (by a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is like magic. Usually after a couple of days the corners of my square nails chip. Its not because of my polish (it happens with all kinds) but because that area is weak and flexes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore! The bonder prevents that chipping and my 2 day manicures now last 5-7 days!</li>
    <li> This is a great base coat.  I bought it because someone said it was great under Jamberry nail wraps.  I did not have good luck with it under them, but under polish, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I am really particular about my nails. I heard this was good so I thought I would give it a try. I don&#x27;t see any difference at all. Not really worth it if there is something else. But it still works as a base coat so it&#x27;s good to have for that. I don&#x27;t notice any difference from my other base coats.</li>
    <li> This product I have used before in the past 2 months.  I liked it so well, I had to buy my own.  My friend allowed me to use hers and I must say, I fell in love with it!  Polish lasts longer and my nails feel stronger also.</li>
    <li> The best base coat I have ever used. It dries quick and works really well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know why this product was such a big deal but I get it now!! This is way better than the clear coat I&#x27;ve been using that flakes away in a couple of days. My nail polish feels like it&#x27;s glued on, while my nails are being protected. Perfect! My manicure definitely feels like it&#x27;s going to be sticking around for a while :)</li>
    <li> Not only does my nail polish stay on for at least 4 days, but my nails are infinitely stronger ever since I started using this base coat.  I feel like my nails grow so much faster, and I have no chipping that I used to get at the top of the nail.  My suggestion when using it: do not wait for the polish to dry before applying the color coat.  I feel like when I have waited a little longer before I applied the second and third coat, the polish tended to peel off.  When I immediately applied the color coat, the polish stayed on for days. Regardless of the peeling or not, my nails are so much healthier after using it regularly.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after reading a few articles online concerning strategies for getting better results from home manicures.

I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, either as a double-dose of clear base coating with no additional polish, or as a single base-coat underneath colored polishes. Indeed, it does seem that my manicures are lasting a day or two longer than previously. I will continue to use this on my  nails.</li>
    <li> only tried this once but seems to work.</li>
    <li> I began using a clear polish about 3 years ago because I noticed my nails splitting, with ridges and crack lines along the nail&#x27;s length.  I became concerned that my nails were thinning and that I would have terrible issues with their appearance in the future, but I have always felt self conscious about the shine.  I&#x27;ve even had people ask if I had a manicure, asking me to show them my hands.  I don&#x27;t like to bring attention to myself, and those types of interactions made me very uncomfortable.  Therefore, I have tried several different products.  I purchased the Orly Bonder to use along with the Orly Nails For Males flat coat polish.  I applied both products 3 days ago.  It looks good, even today.  My nails look healthier and they have a more natural sheen.  I will probably apply each of these products twice weekly.  I would recommend this, (these), products for use by men or women who want a natural, neat appearance for their hands. I will also state that I have always taken very good care of my nails and hands, and I trim my nails neatly before applying polish.</li>
    <li> Love this base coat. It helps my nail polish apply smoothly and has prevent my nails from being stained yellow. Much better than the Revlon Base Coat I had been using, which although was rubbery, didn&#x27;t help preventing staining.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely sold on this base polish! It has been three weeks since I painted my toenails with this base polish and there are no chips at all! They look just like they did the day I painted them. I will never paint my nails without this base polish again.</li>
    <li> Seeing only a limited, if any, benefit of using it.  I do use it consistently and will update this post if I see improvement in the coming months.</li>
    <li> It does make my nail color last longer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this. I&#x27;ve only used it twice when I remove my nail polish it leaves an orange tint. I just don&#x27;t understand why. The bottle on this picture loss like a pale pink but I got a light orange one. I&#x27;m so disappointed. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Seems to help with keeping the polish on.</li>
    <li> I actually learned just last week that Orly nail polish actually one of the worst companies out there when it comes to what they put in their polishes. They actually have a very potent chemical in their polishes called dibutyl phthalate.    THAT BEING SAID - this is an amazing basecoat. My polish lasts twice as long on my nails as without the basecoat, and it takes forever to chip while still being as easy to remove as ever.    UPDATE:  my nails have developed some damage that i&#x27;m very unhappy with due to the chemicals contained in this product, but it really is such a good base. i just hate getting left with bumpy, damaged nails :/</li>
    <li> My nails were splitting and polish chipped off after a day. With this product polish stays on. Manicure last. Very happy with this product. Fast delivery.Will purchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I finally bought something incredibly great!  It really makes nail polish last about 5 day&#x27;s and that to me is incredible, most nail polish with the other chip polish and similar product&#x27;s only had them last a day or 2 so this is really worth it!  I could not find this anywhere so amazon is awesome when it comes to purchasing certain products that you can not find anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Great product that really works.  Helps your self manicure last without chips, for days.  I use it as a base coat, 2 coats of nail polish and a clear top coat.  I own several nail base coats &amp; this one is the best I have ever used.  Orly calls it &amp;#34;Double back tape&amp;#34;, perfect reference!</li>
    <li> Orly Bonder Base Coat provides a nice rubberized texture that allow all nail polishes to adhere to it. This provides great staying power for your polish. A manicure lasts 5-7 days without chipping. Which is a really long time for me because I am constantly using antibacterial foam on my hand and washing them constantly.  Try it you will be amazed!!! Your manicure will always be perfect!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t exactly buy the greatest quality nail polish, so it&#x27;s important to have a great base coat. This works really well for me! My manicures lasted a few days to a week longer than usual.</li>
    <li> I find this base coat actually does prolong my manicures. The price makes it very affordable. The smell is not as offensive as other polishes.</li>
    <li> this is the best base coat.  ive tried Essie, OPI and seche, and none have performed as well as this one.</li>
    <li> My nails are chipping worse than when I did not use a base coat. This is terrible.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST BASE FOR NAIL POLISH....IT MAKES THE POLISH STAY ON LONGER  BETWEEN POLISHES ...MAKES IT TOUGHER TOO.....</li>
    <li> It just feels like a regular Base  coat to me. The Polish didn&#x27;t last any longer than regular Base  coats but it had very little smell.</li>
    <li> Do you want your polish to last? You need to get this base coat. It is great. A little thick but it helps yous polish stay longer.</li>
    <li> I love this base coat! I have only used it on my toes since I do not paint my fingernails very often. When using this, my pedicure lasts for up to three weeks with very minimal chipping. I have gone up to two weeks with no chips in my polish at all. It is great for when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend maintaining and changing your polish. It does take a bit of extra scrubbing to remove but that&#x27;s the whole point; to be resistant and durable. My only complaint is that it does stain my nails a bit with an orange/yellow tint but many nail polishes do that when used without a base coat and will eventually grow out. You have to get pretty close to the nail to see the staining. I definitely think this product is worth the money and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Really makes a difference in how long my polish lasts!</li>
    <li> Takes way too long to dry before you can put on your nail color</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this all these years. This base coat can make even the worst of the pest nail polishes stick! 100% worth the money.</li>
