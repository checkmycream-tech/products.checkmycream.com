<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job, but it takes waaay too much of this to actually thin the nail polish. I put more than 15 drops, but there&#x27;s a lot in the bottle so it&#x27;s okay. I use this for all of my polish brands, not just seche, though.</li>
    <li> I have never tried a nail polish restore product before. I have always hated that by the time a bottle of nail polish is half used the polish has become so thick it has to be thrown away. I saw all the favorable reviews for this product and decided to try it. I am glad I did. It is a great product that really does restore polish. When you add it to a bottle of polish just be careful. It does not take much to make the polish useable again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t stay on my nail for even a day. It started coming off and I didn&#x27;t even do anything with my hands but writing!</li>
    <li> Secret vote top coat is the best but gets a little sticky at the bottom of the bottle. This product extends the life of Seche Vite bd other dried up polishes. Great investment!!!</li>
    <li> I had a bottle of Seche that was getting towards half empty, and I noticed its thick consistency--it wasn&#x27;t quite as easy to use as before, and I remembered that I had some &amp;#34;Restore&amp;#34; on hand. The simple instructions to use the dropper to add it in as needed, and mix, were easy to follow. Now I can use the whole bottle of Seche, and I have plenty of Restore on hand to thin out any nail enamel that needs it, as well as my next bottle of Seche, that superiour quick-dry top coat with the unfortunate habit of thickening up when halfway finished.</li>
    <li> Great to restore polish.</li>
    <li> does just what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!! Just a couple of drops and your old nail polish is renewed!!!!  Very easy to add just wish the dropper screwed to the bottle instead. But well worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it is supposed to do.  I had a beautiful gold textured, rather expensive polish that started drying out too quickly, and this stuff really made it usable again.  Yay!  No more having to toss the polish before it&#x27;s empty.</li>
    <li> This thinner worked very well. I was able to restore my Seche Vite Polish to a consistency that allowed me to use it again. I thought it would take just two or three drops, but in my case it took several drops before I saw results. After restoring the polish I was able to use it again, and it behaved as it should: drying quickly and leaving a high gloss.</li>
    <li> This stuff has saved me a lot of money. I had a few bottles of polish that was getting thick and I couldn&#x27;t find the color no more to replace it. So I bought this and put a few drops in the bottle rolled it around and the polish is back to normal. I really recommend this to everyone who collects nail polish.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I found this. My Seche Vite top coat had dried out a little and was super thick and gummy. I&#x27;d been looking for a nail polish thinner for a while, but no local stores (Walgreens, CVS) seemed to sell anything. This fixed my top coat, and a few other gloopy nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Great stuff....No need to throw out the polish on the bottom of the bottle.  I hate waste!</li>
    <li> I love this so much, I ordered more...</li>
    <li> Holy cow, this saved so many of my nail polishes that I couldn&#x27;t bare to throw away because they got too thick!  It will not, however, save completely dried out polishes.</li>
    <li> Saved my seche top coat! I was too generous with the Restore and it thins out my top coat. Becareful!</li>
    <li> it is very good for your seche vite top coat but i might use it for other thickining polishes as well</li>
    <li> A little goes a long with this stuff and if you purchased the Seche Vite Top Coat you will definitely need it. That stuff drys out so fast.. it is definitely a &amp;#34;High Maintenance&amp;#34; top coat.</li>
    <li> Add me to the growing list of reviewers who are surprised by the first reviewer. I&#x27;d love to know more details on what happened other than \\&quot;it didn&#x27;t work for me\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing! The Seche Vite topcoat thickens up after you use about 1/3 of the bottle, and the Restore helps bring it back so you don&#x27;t waste it. It is different than nail polish thinner in that it RESTORES an ingredient in the topcoat that evaporates every time you open the bottle (hence the name Restore). But the great thing is, you can use it to restore all old polishes! I have brought back some very thick and old ones back to life. I do have plain ol&#x27; polish thinner which has worked ok on other polishes but now I use this for everything. Don&#x27;t use polish thinner on your Seche Vite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like anything else, less is more. Start off with just ONE dropper full (or less)...you can always add, but you can&#x27;t take back. Shake very well and voila! Also, the dropper comes separate. Keep the original cap too - this stuff can evaporate if not shut tightly. Other than that this stuff is rad!</li>
    <li> This does restore Seche Vite to some of its former glory. It does not return it to its original consistency though. Seems to chip a little easier after it&#x27;s been restored and not quite as smooth to apply.</li>
    <li> On my second order of this stuff--it lengthens the lifespan of many of my polishes, not just Seche Vite.</li>
    <li> I find this necessary to thin my Seche Vite when the bottle is nearing the end (it gets too thick.) I now buy Seche Vite in bulk and adding Seche Restore thins it to the right consistency so I don&#x27;t have to throw any away.</li>
    <li> My nail polish aged and thickened up, but this product fixed it right back up. Just be careful and add only a drop or two at a time, because if you thin it too much, it&#x27;s irreversible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the customer service is exceptional. My first order came in defective (I received an empty bottle. Strange.), but I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me a new one. Trust the product and trust the seller. You&#x27;ll be happy you got this!</li>
    <li> This did the trick. I&#x27;m loyal to the brand and if this is the recommended product, then it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> Works great for thinning my Seche Vite so I get more out of the Vite.</li>
    <li> I love seche vite but they gave me the top coat and not the restore.</li>
    <li> worked like a charm for my seche top coat! defiantly a good investment for the rest of my polish collection</li>
    <li> Brought my old nail polishes back to life and thinned a couple of them out the way I wanted! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the Seche Vite fast dry top coat - I use it on EVERY manicure and pedicure I give myself. The only problem with that product is that it DOES tend to dry out quickly and get a little thick to apply smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where this Restore product comes in. The dropper picks up a perfect amount to place into the bottle of top coat to create a new, smooth, thinner polish to apply as a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is SO much product here - I&#x27;m pretty sure it could last years and years.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, I also use it in my polishes, and other nail products. It works.</li>
    <li> My review is entitled \\&quot;Another one...\\&quot; for two reasons:  1. I am also on the \\&quot;what was the first reviewer thinking?\\&quot; list.  2. I have found another product I know I can never live without.  I recently ordered a lot of older, discontinued (or, as Essie.com states, \\&quot;no longer available\\&quot;) Essie lacquers from Amazon. Since I knew they were older, I also knew some of them would be thicker than others. My solution: Seche Restore.  The Restore is amazing. I use it every time I do my nails to thin the polish to go on smoother and thinner, as one review suggests. It did awesome thinning out 3 of the older Essie polishes (Blanc, Golden Nuggets, and Garnet).  Here are general steps I used to gauge the amount of Restore to use:  1. Get a newer polish and just twist and pull the brush out of the polish. Watch how many drops of polish fall off within a few seconds. For example, I usually had 2 drop off within 5 seconds with a new, fresh bottle.  2. Compare that \\&quot;drop time\\&quot; with the bottle that needs restoring. My Essie Garnet, for example, had 1 drop fall off within 5 seconds.  3. Fill up a WHOLE STOPPER FULL of Restore and drop HALF into the Garnet / older polish.  4. Spin the Garnet between hands (shaking polish bottles introduces air into the polish which will cause bubbly nails, leading to chipping), for about 20-30 seconds, then check the consistency.  5. If it had 2 drops within 5 seconds, I knew I was good to go. If not, I added the other half of the stopper to the polished, and repeat step 4.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve gathered from reading other reviews and from my own experiences. I hope that helps others that are unsure how to use this wonderful product! Happy manicures to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service. Received my merchandise pretty quick.</li>
    <li> Good price. Works great with Seche Vite top coat &amp; other polishes.</li>
    <li> Same great product,  and for a great low price.  I would absolutely recommed to any of my friends any day.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff! It will bring nail polishes back from the dead. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great for thinning out your nail polish</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It really restored my seche vite fast dry top coat to easy to manage perfection.</li>
    <li> This works wonders on clumpy/old nail polish! A couple of drops, shake it well and it&#x27;s just like new and sometimes better. Word of warning though, make sure you remember a little goes a long way. Add a drop at a time until it&#x27;s the consistency you want, otherwise it will be more like water than finger nail polish.</li>
    <li> Seche Restore did work great.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work with some top coats that I had. (sally hansen, opi, and CND)&lt;br /&gt;But other nail polish got back their original thinness. not sticky any more.</li>
    <li> A lot of my nail polishes have thickened with time. I am a polish junkie and I have loads of colors that I haven&#x27;t used in a while. I thought this product might do the trick but its meh. Its an okay product, can&#x27;t say that I love it. The directions are very vague. Even after I get he nail polish to thin down, the nail polish again thickens in 24 hours. So I can&#x27;t really say that I am in love with this product.</li>
    <li> Anyone who uses seche vite should invest in the seche restore! Seche vite starts to get thick about halfway through the bottle.  A few drops of this makes it like new again.  I also have used it to thin essie polishes and it worked well.  I&#x27;m not sure about other brands though. One bottle of restore will last you through several bottles of seche vite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m also not sure why one wouldn&#x27;t like this product... It does its job exactly as it should. Also works well with other polish brands. Helps restore old, dry, tacky polishes to like new consistancy. Definitely a good product to have on hand.    Tips: Try a few drops at a time. You can always add more but you can&#x27;t take away too much. Its also best not to shake your bottles but to gently roll between the palms of your hands. If you do chose to shake them, wait a while before use since shaking bottles causes airbubbles which makes bubbles show on your nails.</li>
    <li> The bottle broke in the bag where I keep all my nail paints.</li>
    <li> Definitely works, but I had to add a LOT more than the directions say to get my Seche Vite top coat to the right consistency. However, I still have a lot left and should be able to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; many more top coat bottles in the future so I figure it&#x27;s still a pretty good deal. It&#x27;s also a much better deal than buying a new bottle of the top coat every time it thickens up. Overall I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> It smells terrible, but works as expected</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing works on all polish. The customer service was great.</li>
    <li> life saver for your nail polish. Quick delivery</li>
    <li> Gave me a top coat instead of a restore polish 😒</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I like the product because it came empty!  All of the liquid spilled in the box and evaporated.  I don&#x27;t think it was sealed properly.  Not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> love this. works perfectly  with Seche Vite.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect stuff to thin out my favorite top coat, Seche Vite, so I can get use from the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> This has worked great to restore several polishes I have--both regular polish and glitter--of a variety of brands (mostly OPI and China Glaze)</li>
    <li> Item was expected to ship/arrive between May 13/17, and I recieved it early, May 11th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly as pictured, the correct item, and works as it is supposed to. Sometimes sellers of Seche products on Amazon sell fake product and that is not the case with this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added 2 full droppers into my thickening bottle of Seche Vite top coat and it brought it back to its original consistency. Seche Restore does have a particularly strong smell (as do all the Seche products I use) but I suspect that is the toluene.</li>
    <li> Seche Vite is the BEST topcoat I have EVER used! Now I have this to make it last and fully get all my moneys worth. My nails are constantly painted and this is a product I would not live without. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> works great for all polishes, even if they aren&#x27;t seche. more than satisfied with the product and would recommend it to any lover of nail polish</li>
    <li> I like the product and it is a good price with good delivery. I will purchase it again if it is on sale.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this product. It extends the life of my Seche Vite Topcoat which I can&#x27;t live without. It is the best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used. And now I can use the whole bottle with the Seche Restore. I received it with very quick delivery from this vendor with the product packaged very well. Would recommend this product and vendor to everyone. Thank you for the great service.</li>
    <li> I received this just yesterday and immediately went to thinning out old icky polishes I was about to throw away. I saved over 10 bottles of polish with this little bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied 5-10 drops at a time, shook/rolled it all in, and played it by ear after that. Some of my really gunky bottles took probably 30 drops or more to save, but the point is that they were saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, would definitely recommend to save old polishes!</li>
    <li> The product itself works perfectly, but I would suggest buying this in an actual store, not from this online seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered this the first time it arrived with only a few drops left in it.  I contacted Amazon support (who are wonderful) and they told me they would send out another bottle free of charge, no need to return the other or any further hassle on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received the second bottle, and it is just under half full.  Both times I could smell the product before even opening the box, which of course meant it leaked everywhere.  There is a cap that is meant to stop the leaking, but both times I&#x27;ve opened the lid on the restore polish and instead of the cap being flush with the opening of the bottle, it is stuck up in the screw on top of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the product is inexpensive - but you won&#x27;t get the entire bottle.  It would be a better value to purchase this in store.</li>
    <li> Loved it. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again since I hoard all of my polishes. But this stuff keeps them alive and leaves the nasty goopiness in the past.</li>
    <li> I love the Seche top coat, but if you&#x27;re not using it a whole lot then it tends to get really thick and gooey, and hard to use. When I added a few drops of Seche Restore, the top coat became like new again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a lifesaver when you&#x27;re not even halfway through a bottle of your favorite polish and it starts to get thick and goopy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Seche quick-dry topcoat, but about halfway through the bottle it turns sticky and stringy. This restoring formula gives my polish a second life! I love it!</li>
    <li> I was worried that my seche vite dry fast top coat was getting too thick.  A few dropper fulls of this restored the top coat to usefulness</li>
    <li> Awesome.....works wonderfully and you barely need to use any at all. Makes seche vite top coat work like brand new.</li>
    <li> Lasts longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used. Love that it dries fast too.</li>
    <li> And it stinks. I could smell it yards away from the Amazon package. Now taken out of the Amazon carton and put away until I need to use it. I can smell it as soon as I enter the room. I checked, the jar is tightly closed. Is it this way for everyone or should I return it?</li>
    <li> Bought this to thin out top coat that got very thick and became unusable halfway through the bottle.  Used 3 full droppers with full recovery of top coat.  No side effects to top coat&#x27;s formula.</li>
    <li> The first bottle I received had leaked in the package. I contacted the seller and they sent me a new bottle. Very happy with customer service I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself worked very well at not only thinning the top coat of Seche Vite, but it also returned all of the nail polishes I have that had turned goopy to their original state. I used this on a few polishes that were several years old at the very least and it made them as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product and seller!</li>
    <li> This stuff works well! I will purchase again from this store.</li>
    <li> I actually got a big 2oz bottle instead of a small .5oz I&#x27;m not sure if it was an accident, but that was a plus. Also, this works amazing with glitter polishes as well. I had a glitter polish that the polish was stuck to the brush, and I added a few drops to the polish with my dropper, and the polish is liked brand new!! It also works for fast dry nailpolish, I was alittle worried it would effect that, but it didn&#x27;t. I would reccomend this to anynody and i WILL bye this again!</li>
    <li> The product had evaporated before I opened the package.  Totally useless.  I would have returned it but it was more work than it was worth.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this stuff! I almost wish I had more old nail polish so I could use it! I was really upset when my favorite OPI nail polish was getting too thick to use. It was thick and goopy and left brush strokes and globs of polish on my nails. With just a few drops of this stuff it is like new again! I&#x27;ve used it on a few other polishes as well as the the Seche Vite top coat and you have to be careful with how much you use. Just add a couple drops at a time, shake it up, check the thickness, and repeat if needed. I&#x27;ve found that the thin striper polishes I buy at Sally Beauty get dried out kinda quick because the tops don&#x27;t close well enough and I&#x27;ve saved two of them from getting tossed already! I really think that in the long run it will save me a ton of money from getting replacements. I just wish I found it sooner!</li>
    <li> Seche is the only top coat that I use and this is the best price that I have found on the thinner.  This is a must because the top coat turns gloppy after using half the bottle.  This thinner restores the top coat to like new consistency.  It is also great to turn my old polishes that are thick to like new again.</li>
    <li> I am a believer!  This top coat kept my nails looking shiny for an entire week.  It also prevents chipping and makes the polish last longer.  I won&#x27;t say I can go an entire two weeks before touching up - but certainly a MAJOR improvement over my old topcoat.  It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> one of the bottles was leaking so one was half empty and one was ok. thankfully only one was a gift.</li>
    <li> This is great to use on Seche Vite fast drying top coat when it gets all thick and goopy. Just a few drops of this and the top coat is back to new and still dries fast</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Just add a few drops to any brand goopy polish, roll between your hands and you&#x27;re good to go!! It&#x27;s like the polish is brand new!!</li>
    <li> I have nail polishes after nail polishes and having a restore nail polish is a must for me, and this works amazing.</li>
    <li> My Sech Vite topcoat was getting far too thick and wasn&#x27;t applying easily at all.  This did the trick.  I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re supposed to use this instead of any other nail polish thinner, but hey, I&#x27;m loyal to the brand and if this is the recommended product, then it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I cannot remember how quick the delivery was but I&#x27;m happy with the quality of product. It thins out thick, clumpy nail polishes/top coat and last a long time. You can read a thorough review here, [...]</li>
    <li> Applied one drop of Seche to a bottle of diminishing nail polish and the consistency was just like new again!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t needed to use this for my Seche Vite yet, but I used it on a couple of old nail polishes. Now I wish that I hadn&#x27;t thrown my others out. This is really fantastic; it makes my polish like new again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some really nice pretty polish that had thickened dramatically to the point where I stopped using it. Once I started using the Restore, I can now again use these colors. I wish I had known about this product years ago.</li>
    <li> It is formulated specifically for Seche Vite, but it restores ANY nail polish to it&#x27;s original non-tacky non-dried state. I think I will buy a bigger bottle next time so I won&#x27;t be so stingy about using more of it in each polish. Would definitely recommend for anyone who hates wasting nail polish because it gets all gross and sticky or because you left the top off and it dried up.</li>
    <li> Nice dropper. It works as anticipated.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but from the reviews, I will like it.  I can restore the fluidity of the top coat and also my other colors that are getting thick.  Looking forward to using it soon.</li>
    <li> It took more drops than I thought to get it to the right consistency, but when it worked, it was like having a brand new bottle of Seche Vite.</li>
    <li> Wow. My old lumpy seche vite was reborn with this restore formula.&lt;br /&gt;My old bottle had about 1/3 left, and after adding this restore formula, it filled up to more than half way up.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the results too; it is as effective as a new seche vite.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to all those seche vite lovers out there.</li>
    <li> Works with any brand of Polish!!</li>
    <li> The bottle came and was dry, no product.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t tell if it leaked or evaporated.&lt;br /&gt;I would like the bottle replaced.</li>
    <li> The restore does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. It thins the polish so that you can get the consistency you want/need after so many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issue(s): The bottle&#x27;s top came unscrewed and it leaked. The smell was strong and the box came apart. It also sucks that it&#x27;s pretty much necessary for Seche products.</li>
    <li> The fact that it comes with a little dropper makes having this worth while. I bought it for the purpose of my seche vite but other than that I would probably stick to the bigger bottles of thinner for less than the price of this.</li>
    <li> Saved many a dried up nail polish thanks to this handy product.  Depending on how dry the nail polish is is how much you are going to put in.  For the very dry, I will use an entire dropper to start, for polishes that would apply better if it were more runny, 3-5 drops to start.  Then you slowly roll the bottle around in your hands to &amp;#34;fold in&amp;#34; and evenly distribute the thinner.  I feel like I have used so much of this product yet I have more than half a bottle left, this should last me for a long time.</li>
    <li> Just a few drops into my old gunky nail polish and now its like new. Love it when products actually work. Awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a must-have! Especially since Seche Vite has a tendency to thicken and turn all gloopy by the time it&#x27;s halfway done. It&#x27;s best to add a few drops at a time, and then swirl/roll the polish around (not shake, air bubbles will form) and then test to see if that is done. Else you&#x27;ll just end up thinning it out too much! I love that it comes with a dropper, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.  I used up the first one reviving many bottles of nail polish that had thickened over the years, some over decades!  The expensive Chanel polish I bought over 10 years ago that I thought I&#x27;d have to throw out now applies like new.  This is meant to be used with Seche Vite top coat, which can thicken after many use.  Very effective!</li>
    <li> This polish restore is great, I got so disgusted throwing away bottle after bottle of Seche Vite  polish simply beacause it thickened up. This works great, I&#x27;ve also used it with my other polishes without any problems. So glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> If you love Seche Vite and use a lot of it this is a must have. Seche Vite has toluene in it and when it gets goopy it needs not only thinner but toluene, which is what sets this apart from regular polish thinner. A couple of drops of this and your Seche is back to the perfect top coat we all love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has an amazing second use though! If you have older nail polishes that aren&#x27;t 3 free (the three are Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP), Formaldehyde and Toluene.) and have gotten thick and just won&#x27;t dry, it&#x27;s because the toluene has evaporated! I had an older OPI that no matter how much thinner I used just wouldn&#x27;t dry, even hours and hours later it was still gooey. However I added some Seche Restore and bam! MAGIC! It was right back to it&#x27;s original formula and finally usable.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Just add a few drops and thick goopy nail polish becomes new again.  I no longer have to throw out old nail polish</li>
    <li> This item is great it restored old polishes prefectly</li>
    <li> The package arrived earlier than expected and the bottle was much larger than pictured. It is abut two-three times larger than a nailpolish bottle and seeing as you only need a few drops, i see this product lasting a long time.  I bought it to go with my Seche Vite polish however i used it on the other nailpolishes in my collection and it has revived them.  If you have thick polish dont throw it away try this first!</li>
    <li> This is the best brand for top coat and base coat.  Together the nail polish dries so fast and hard.  I just can&#x27;t find it here in hawaii</li>
    <li> this is the exact same product you&#x27;d find in beauty supply stores at half the cost. i will definitely be buying more in the future. great product! seche vite is a must for any manicure enthusiast.</li>
    <li> This was a difficult product to find, and I am more than satisfied with price, availability and function.  Well done.</li>
    <li> If you use Seche Vite, you understand the major flaw in that product...it gets thick over time (and I&#x27;m not talking about a long time). This fixes that, realistically saving me money in the long term, because this isn&#x27;t terribly expensive, and that top coat kind of is. This can also be used to salvage that old bottle of polish that you love to pieces and was discontinued, or just any polish that you want to get your money&#x27;s worth from. They all get thicker over time.</li>
    <li> Gotta have this. Love Seche Vite. ^_^</li>
    <li> 3 stars because i feel like ahh its kind of works.  I use this for my polish when needed which is why i bought it, thats why i only have 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This has saved a few bottles of polish for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say its worth the money.  yay yay</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it said it would!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I don&#x27;t know what the reviewer who didn&#x27;t like it did or didn&#x27;t do, but it works great, as it saves both Seche and other brands of polish that have thickened to an unuseable consistency.  You do have to use more than one drop of it...maybe that&#x27;s where she went wrong.  Use the dropper full, squirt it in, mix well, then test the consistency.  Add more if needed.  Seche Fast Drying Top Coat is the BEST in the world, but it does have a tendency to thicken by the time the bottle is about half full. Restore has saved me lots of money and I always make sure I have a bottle on hand.</li>
    <li> I was quite upset when I received this product in the mail after 3 weeks! It took forever for amazon to ship this product! And when I finally got this, there was less than a quarter of the product when in the bottle. Then when I tried to use the nail polish, the pipet/dropper device didn&#x27;t suck up the liquid!!! So, overall, I am left with a card board box that smells strongly of chemicals, a little bit of nail polish, and a defective pipet. And to top it all off, amazon doesn&#x27;t allow people to return it because it&#x27;s a chemical liquid! What a waste of money this ended up being. When I did use this product it worked fairly well at thinning out my older nail polishes from a few years ago. So, I would recommend this product, but don&#x27;t buy it online!</li>
    <li> Works very well..I had very gooey fingernail polish and this worked!</li>
    <li> The best!  Dries quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to make you seche polish come back from the brink of thick goopyness... made it like new again now i can finally use everything in the bottle!</li>
    <li> This product is the best. Seche vite is my all time favorite top coat but I was having to throw the last half of the bottles away because it was too thick to work with. Then I heard of this product and it brings it back to the consistency it was when I bought it. And it works for my other polishes as well. It is a great money saver. The only downside is that it has toluene in it which is kinda scary. But overall it is a great product and I got it really quick. Also I ordered the .5 ounce and I got a 2 ounce which is awesome. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wears polish even if they don&#x27;t use seche vite</li>
    <li> Not really sure since I only recently used it for the first time, but it does seem like it thinned out the Seche top coat.  I&#x27;ve also put a few drops in another brand top coat.  It seemed to help some what, but it definitely seemed to do a good job of thinning the Seche top coat product.  If it continues to do a good job, I will continue to purchase it for thinning out the Seche top coat.</li>
    <li> Seche Vite is my favorite top coat but it does thicken too much by about halfway through a bottle.  Regular polish thinner doesn&#x27;t work well for Seche-Vite and this is great - restores to the original consistency with only a few drops.</li>
    <li> Works just like it says! I used it to restore my top coat, and it worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great thinner.  Just a tab will do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish last for 2 weeks!!! But I also use chima glaze strong adhesion base coat to help nail polish adhere. After a week or every 3 days apply another top coat the keep the polish from chipping and scratches. When I use red colors it does not stain my nails. I do not like the chima glaze top dry (nail dryer) coat. To dry (fast nail dryer) my nails I use Seche Vite . It dries quicker and harder; no lines or sheet marks. Both nail dryers have a tiny bit of shrinkage, Seche Vite has less</li>
    <li> My first package arrived leaking into my mailbox. I notified the seller and they immediately sent out a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself...the smell is honestly awful (and maybe I&#x27;m more sensitive to it after opening a mailbox full of fumes) but it does the job it&#x27;s intended for exactly as described.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to add just the right amount of drops to your Seche vitae topcoat when it gets thick and stringy, and unusable.  I always keep some on hand to keep that perfect consistency of my top coat!</li>
    <li> Good product. Works well.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders to restore those gooey old nail polishes back to life. This is my favorite product of all time.</li>
    <li> If you like Seche Vite, you need this product. Works as advertised to thin polish as you go and make it usable again.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition, the product will please my boyfriend and really recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> This saved my Dry Fast Topcoat! It always gets goopy about halfway through, and just a few drops of this brings it back to the original consistency. It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This definitely helped the dry coat from thinning back out. It is a must have if you&#x27;re going to get Seche Vite&#x27;s Dry Fast Top Coat.</li>
    <li> worked! and restored my seche vite</li>
    <li> great price - found it for $5 less than what is sold at Ulta beauty</li>
    <li> I have always used nail polish remover and noticed my polish was never the same after putting polish remover in it. This stuff is fantastic!!!! I even got a huge bottle! It works so well and my nail polish is still vibrantly colored, it doesn&#x27;t separate like it did when I was using the remover... The shipping was fast and came in a nice box that kept it safe from breaking. I keep it in the box because it&#x27;s great for storage. I don&#x27;t understand why it would have a bad review! If you use it correctly, it&#x27;s a great product! I would def recommend it! I have told all my friends about it!</li>
    <li> I love my Seche Vite Quick Dry Top Coat but it tends to get thick quickly.  This is the only stuff that thins it but doesn&#x27;t destroy the quick dry part of the top coat.  Well worth the extra $ to save my beloved Seche Vite Quick Dry Top Coat!</li>
    <li> I Love Seche Vite and use it every time I do my nails. If you have ever used it you know it gets thick and goopy when you have only used half a bottle or so. I believe this happens because something in the formula evaporates when you have the bottle open when you use it. So that&#x27;s why you need the Seche Restore, it replaces what evaporated. I start with a few drops until it gets back to it&#x27;s normal state. You just have to add some drops when it needs it and you will have no problems using the whole bottle of Seche Vite. I have gone thru several bottles of Seche Vite (because it&#x27;s THE BEST EVER FAST DRYING TOPCOAT!!) so adding the Restore is no big deal for me.</li>
    <li> Helps my polish not be so thick :)</li>
    <li> Works well, but since there is no way to dispense effectively, it becomes messy. Product picture shows a dropper, but there wasn&#x27;t one included with mine. Not sure if this means a factory defect or what.</li>
    <li> Was never able to use the product both the original and replacement bottles were received with the lid off and the product spilled</li>
    <li> Brought polishes back to life that I had all but given up on! You know, you have that one discontinued color you can&#x27;t bear to throw out, or, in my case, that one I got secondhand from a girl in high school with the label all rubbed off that I wouldn&#x27;t know how to replace if it even still exists. (Yeah, really. Thanks for the awesome polish, Maria!) Was concerned that it would be used up quickly, but it really just takes a couple of drops to revive a polish, so this stuff is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Seche vite is where it&#x27;s at.It&#x27;s the only topcoat I really use. Dries super fast, nice and shiny. It does goop up, yes, but get Seche restore and you can push your bottle a lot further!</li>
    <li> This product is the best nail polish first aid I&#x27;ve ever used! Usually I use a couple drops of nail polish remover to thin out my polish if it&#x27;s thick but it always ends up just as bad next time I use it. Seche Vite Restore thins the nail polish perfectly, cidculating throughout the whole bottle of polish for a brand new bottle consistency! The only reason I&#x27;m rating this 4 not 5 strs is because I literally just brought put my nail stuff and dropped the bottle onto a carpet floor and it broke (from a 2 foot high shelf). All in all it&#x27;s an awesome product, well worth the money. Just be carefule because the lid is extra feagile and once broken it can evaporate.</li>
    <li> Completely revives your nail polish, do not be afraid to use a whole dropper or more on a bottle. You have to use more than one drop to see results. Fill the entire dropper then dispense into nail polish. Does not change color, makes it oh so smoother, better than new nail polish!</li>
    <li> Works great in restoring old and thickened nail polishes. However, based on the picture, I thought I would be receiving a dropper to dispense the product as well. However, the bottle of Seche Restore definitely did not come with a dropper. It works just fine, but it spills all over the place when I pour the Seche Restore into nail polish bottles.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problem with this product. It worked as expected and the price i got it for was fairly good. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what is described. Great product For thick polishes and even really old ones. I would definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Seche ViteTop Coat!  But, what happens with any nail product?  It dries out or simply cannot be used to the last drop.  Using the Restore has lengthened my top coat&#x27;s life.</li>
    <li> There are some things you get that you wonder how you ever did without...this is one of them!  For years I threw away &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; nail polish and wasted so much money.  Never again!  This has done wonders with my nail polish.  I read a review that said to fill the plunger all the way then use half and &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; the polish by how many drops there are in 5 seconds (2 is like new, 1 needs more Seche Restore)..what a great tip.</li>
    <li> This item \\&quot;contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects and other reproductive harm.\\&quot; Nowhere on the website is this specific information when you purchase it, and you will not find out about it until you read it on the box in your hand. Not all nail enamels and thinners contain toxins, but this one is pure poison, and should come with the skull and bones sign. Will never buy seche brand ever again.</li>
    <li> Best topcoat. Great price at Amazon.</li>
    <li> It took me more drops and time than I anticipated to bring my seche vite back to life, but that may just be because I waited too long to restore it.  Anyway, it worked although I am afraid to read what chemicals are in this product</li>
    <li> this product really does work. I did however only put it on 1-2 times a week or every time i changed my nail polish cause it does have a tendency to make your nails so hard that they can seem a little brittle...so i would recommend using it one to times a week or alternatively buy this product in the lesser concentrated formula as it comes in 3 different strengths..the one i purchased was for nails that were paper thin even though my nails were not that bad, they would however flake at the ends and were just ...plain weak.  My nails are perfect now and the one bottle has lasted me 3 months!  i honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> Gives new life to old polish! Better than any other thinner on the market. I have used it in all  my polishes.</li>
    <li> I had some favorites lying around that were too thick and old and I thought they couldn&#x27;t be saved. I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. Seche saves the day! They are like new. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is great, I needed to find something to thin down my Seche Vite once it got thick.  This is also working great on my other polishes that are too thick.  Worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this stuff does get thick in the course of normal usage. The thinner takes care of this problem, with only a few drops it&#x27;s back to the original consistancey.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my bottle of Seche Restore. I originally bought it to be paired with my bottle of Seche Vite that had started to go a little thick, but I use it to restore nail polish that is getting a little goopy, too. It works like a charm and will be a new staple in my nail polish/nail care collection.</li>
    <li> The product does work, but you have to use considerably more amount of it than directed. And even then, the consistency is close but not the same as new. So, use, but know that it does not work wonders as advertised.</li>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t get it to mine to mix in</li>
    <li> Seche is a great product. This thinner keeps it working til the bottle is empty! Wonderful and Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge nail addict and I had a bunch that were getting clumpy so I took a chance &amp; I love it!</li>
    <li> Let me tell you this- a little goes a Long way! You don&#x27;t need more than a few drops for your nail polish to be like new! Use just as directed and turn cheap nail polish into salon-quality. This is so much better than using nail polish remover, which ruins nail polish. Great buy.</li>
    <li> It worked just as described, just be careful on following the instructions as indicated otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with a polish too liquid to be used.</li>
    <li> Works very well, have to use a little more than the instructions indicate, but thins the polish very well. It even helps clear the dried bits from around the top of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Great restore liquid for any polish. I use it not just with Seche Vite, but with any polish that is gunking up (as they all do over time). This has saved many a polish for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, any polish that I have that starts to get sticky I add a few drops of this and it makes it brand new again. I mainly use OPI and Julep and it works well in both of those. Also the top coat from this company is the best top coat I have ever tried and if you watch any nail art tutorials, almost everyone raves about the top coat and say that when you&#x27;re about half way done with it you need to use this to bring back the consistency. Overall awesome product that saves you money and prevents wasting product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this at first, but it really does restore thick, old nail polish back to it&#x27;s like-new state. I used three full droppers which I added one at a time. Then I rolled the nail polish bottle between my hands. This will definitely extend the life of my nail polishes. It does what it says and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> My bottle of Seche Vite and a few other bottles of nail polish were getting all dried up, so I bought this. It worked perfectly! Yay :)</li>
    <li> Used this to bring back my goopy Seche vite and also used it on a chunky Essie Polish amongst others and it worked great to bring them back to life!</li>
    <li> I think this works really well. It will not restore really clumpy nail polish, but it will give new life to slightly gloppy nail polish.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product. I made my thick nail polish thinner for continued use. I will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used this yet, but it arrived on time and inline others have stated, mine was sealed and completely full. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> THIS THE LAST TIME ORDERING ANY NAIL ITEM I THINK IT IS A BIT OLD IT WAS THICK NONE ADHESIVE TO NAIL AND CAN NOT BE RETURNED THIS BRAND NO GOOD OTHERS WERE OK</li>
    <li> Keep in cool places.left in my makeup bag and evaporated on its own😒 waste</li>
    <li> The product does what it says. I have a half full bottle that was getting goopy and stringy. It took maybe 6 drops from the dropper provided and it was back to its normal glossy consistency. I read some other reviews about how it ruined the bottle or didn&#x27;t work-- that&#x27;s a load of bs. If it&#x27;s not working you used too much or not enough. Start with 2 drops, roll the bottle in your hands, watch when you pull the brush out and if it&#x27;s goopy add 2 more drops and roll again. Don&#x27;t just start by adding a full dropper and shake it up like an animal!! Seche Vite is the best top cop I&#x27;ve ever used (I&#x27;m an polisholic) and this restore helps you get every penny&#x27;s worth from the bottle.</li>
    <li> I had almost half a bottle of the Seche Vite Topcoat that was too thick to use. This thinner worked perfectly!  I now have a useable bottle of topcoat. Yeah! Make sure to follow the directions that are included, otherwise it may not work as intended. It really doesn&#x27;t take much of this to thin out the topcoat.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!! I have used it in my base coats, top coats and my favorite polishes that I haven&#x27;t been able to use and it&#x27;s fixed every one of them! It doesn&#x27;t take but a few little drops and your old favorite polishes will be as good as they were the day you bought them. I highly recommend this product and I will definetly purchase from this seller, again, in the future. The shipping was super fast, too!</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS AMAZING. Thinned my seche right out so i could get the most out of the bottle. LOVE IT! It also works on any polishes and teh dripper is VERY convenient.</li>
    <li> Keep your favorite polish going longer with this product. Using your nail polish exposes it to the air and the solvent evaporates.  This restores the proper balance of color and solvent.</li>
    <li> This is great.  I haven&#x27;t used it a lot but I have added it to fingernail polish that was a bit gummy and this thinned it out and made it usable.</li>
    <li> when i opened my mail box i was overwhelmed with a chemical smell. so i knew the product had busted or something. the packaging was moist, although the bottle hadnt busted. maybe it leaked out?? the bottle was half empty upon opening the envelope even the though there was FRAGILE/HANDLE WITH CARE warning messages all over the envelope. the rubber piece of the dropper was also not connect, fell right off. had to use my finger tip to create suction but still not great. when using SECHE RESTORE in my SECHE VITE DRY FAST TOP COAT i noticed a very very subtle difference. barely anything. ---to be fair, in reviews ive read it doesnt say that RESTORE is a thinner, but just an additive that replaces certain properties that SECHE VITE loses over time....however, not impressed. also tried it in an Essie topcoat that has dried up. i noticed nothing after adding RESTORE to it. glad i didnt pay full price for this at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this product. will try a &amp;#34;nail polish thinner&amp;#34; from a beauty store next time.</li>
    <li> It works great and thinned out my nailpolishes pretty well :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you have to use the whole dropper full, from my experience, but I added by halves so as not to overthin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a really old polish that is almost completely solid by now as far as I can tell (the bottle is too cute to throw out). and I decided to try it out, out of curiosity. unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work. so clearly, there are some nailpolishes beyond saving. but this was from 7 years ago. my other pretty thick nailpolishes were saved though. awesome product :)</li>
    <li> Seche Restore is fabulous!  This product has saved me a fortune.  Just add a few drops (or more if needed) to nail polish that has become too thick to use - voila!  - it&#x27;s like new.  Worth its weight in gold.</li>
    <li> Makes it last much longer</li>
    <li> You can use in any polish and it diffidently helped some of my old goopy polishes! Would def reccomend- just as a note in has toluene in it!</li>
    <li> This works exactly as described.  Just a few drops are enough to restore nail polish that has been in my polish case, unused, for a long time. Brought them right back to life and ready to apply.  Great value, as a little goes such a long way.  I&#x27;ve used more expensive polish thinners, and this works just as well.</li>
    <li> Works as intended, but wish it was 5 free!</li>
    <li> I had several bottles of Seche Vite lying around and if you&#x27;ve ever used SV, you know that it gets to point about halfway through the bottle where it gets weird and gloopy like hot glue. So I usually stop using the bottle at that point and buy a new bottle. But, I added about 10-15 drops (I started with less, as suggested, but it wasn&#x27;t doing anything) and old bottles were brought back to life!! I combined 3 old bottles into one and have a seemingly new bottle of SV!!</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely wonderful product for your dry nailpolish. With this product, you can literally make your nail polishes last forever! A few drops of this will restore your dried nail polish to its original state. There are no negative side effects to your nail polish when you put this in it. I&#x27;ve also used this to restore my Seche Vite topcoat. The topcoat dries up quite easily and I just drop a few drops of this into it every 2 months or so and the Seche Vite can also last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two drops of this will make your thicker nail polish more liquid, and 10-15 drops can completely restore your 90% dried up nail polish (yes, it can restore that nail polish you thought was completely done for). Definitely recommend and worth it for the price, since you can use it for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but it hasn&#x27;t worked as expected. I&#x27;ve added *a lot* of this into my Sech Vite quickdry topcoat that was drying up and getting thicker. The Sech Restore would return my topcoat to its regular consistency for a short amount of time, but my topcoat has now thickened again. It also takes much longer to dry as a result! I may have to just purchase a new bottle of topcoat instead.</li>
    <li> People think this can only be used in Seche Polish but honestly I use it on all my polished and it works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to restore some of my nail polish to its original state. Having over 200 bottles in my collection, this stuff is a necessity! It works WONDERFULLY!</li>
    <li> If you use Seche base and top coats, then you&#x27;ll definitely need this thinner at some point. Seche Vite topcoat starts getting really thick and goopy about halfway through the bottle, so a few drops of thinner will help return it to its original formula. I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying this, it&#x27;s fairly priced and it ships quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I can&#x27;t believe I lived without it for so long! All you have to do is use just a few drops and voila! Good as new.</li>
    <li> I love Seche. I&#x27;ve tried it before and it&#x27;s a great value.&lt;br /&gt;Since I already love the brand and the product, all I can say about my purchase is I got it very fast!</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work , i tried adding more than 6 drops still it doesn&#x27;t thine the polish i even tried different polishes .. i don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I love seche products they all work great! I usually use nail polish remover to thin out polish but this works great and is better for the polish</li>
    <li> This thinned out my seche vite topcoat fine, took a couple more drops than I anticipated but it served its purpose.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really completely restore the top coat.  It still stay a little thick but it&#x27;s really good for other polish brands.  It does help you get more out of your polish.  Also, it works just fine on both Essie &amp; Zoya who claim to need special thinners for their formulas.</li>
    <li> I have restored several of my older bottles of nail polish.  This works just as it says.  I tried it because I am in love with the topcoat.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I wish I had gotten to reviewing this product sooner but I simply forgot, but i would definitely suggest to anyone considering buying this to go to your local beauty store and buying it in person. Because the cap doesn&#x27;t have a brush it doesn&#x27;t seal all the way when closed, which could easily be fixed but unfortunately, isn&#x27;t. I received the product more than half empty and sticky… so insanely sticky. And smelly! I couldn&#x27;t get the smell out of our mailbox and so our mail smelled like this for a while. Also, because the product had leaked it ruined the black part of the dropper. It ended up cracking and didn&#x27;t fit from expanding due to the prolonged exposure. I can&#x27;t say if this is the sellers fault or fault of the company making the product as I have never bought it in person so I don&#x27;t know if it has a stopper to keep it from leaking, but I do know I will not be buying this product ANYWHERE online in the future.</li>
    <li> so glad I found this to use with my favorite Seche Vite top coat when it started to thicken! It restored my 1/2 used bottle of top coat to it&#x27;s former performance when it was first opened. A definite must-have if you use Seche Vite top coat regularly.</li>
    <li> Tried using nail polish remover in desperation once to liquify a nail polish (not good results) and then came across this item.  I don&#x27;t live under a rock but I never knew this even existed.  Now I can&#x27;t imagine living without it.  I know Seche products have all the toluene and chemicals in them (I use only OPI polishes which do not) so I limit my Seche products to this and their clear top coat - which is truly the best around.</li>
    <li> because of this product I got my nail polish mojo back, no more smears and fast on the go drying time</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet as I got it for when I do need it. I love this brand of polish!</li>
    <li> If you put to much you will mess up your polish be careful.</li>
    <li> the polish thinner works well. it has restored some of my polishes wonderfully. i haven&#x27;t tried it as a top coat yet.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on my Seche Vite yet, but I&#x27;ve used it to thin out a couple of other polishes. And it works wonderfully. A few drops in the bottle makes my old polish just like new. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
    <li> just received mine on the exact day it was scheduled ... the bottle is alittle bigger then the one in the picture and it didnt come with one of those droppers,,, but all and all im happy.... i am a bit worried because some of the product seems to have evaporated ... only a little but im wondering will i have a problem over time with the rest of the product ...  will update after acouple uses</li>
    <li> I thought once the nail polish is thick &amp; gloppy that will be the end of it then i found seche restore i Put  2 to 4 drops in the nail polish and my nail polish came back to life. 😊</li>
    <li> It seems to do ok, but it&#x27;s a bit early to tell. I&#x27;ve only used it once in an older Opi bottle of nail polish. I&#x27;d really like for it to work in the Seche Vite, but it doesn&#x27;t. But they state that in the description, so are up front about informing you. I&#x27;m just saying, I wish it would, because the Seche Vite tents to dry out faster, and is wasted. But I&#x27;ll tell you, there is no other combo I&#x27;ve found that does a better job of preserving my manicure/pedicure...Seche Clear base coat, Opi polish of choice, then a top coat of Seche Vite.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to put this on my Seche clear base once it starts getting thick, I still have not used it but I trust anything from Seche since it was a great buy with the Clear base coat.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! It worked great on all the polish I tried it with! It&#x27;s a nail polish life saver! So worth the money!</li>
    <li> Really works great on polish that started to get thick...and chip a lot.  Used this and seems to be staying on my nails better.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, however my experience ordering it from Amazon, was not a good one, which is rare, because I order tons of stuff with Prime and most get to me with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first bottle was almost empty, had spilled in the box.  Lid was on, but loose. I called Amazon and was told it was not returnable, but they would send me another replacement bottle anyway.  I received the 2nd one and same thing only nothing left in this bottle.  Lid was loose again.  I received a email  from Amazon, if I didn&#x27;t return the first one, I would be charged, which I was.  It was my fault because I was ill during this time and didn&#x27;t get it handled in time.  Don&#x27;t know if the seal won&#x27;t hold enough to prevent spillage with air shipping (pressure) or if the lids were just not tightened well enough to begin with.  Still need the product and difficult for me to get out now to get it, but am hesitant to try it for the 3rd time. Just thought I would  leave this review in case it is happening often, or so Amazon can take steps to prevent this from happening.  Maybe taping the lid on would help?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product, so didn&#x27;t want to ding it by giving it a 1 star rating.  Gave it 3 stars for that and took off 2 for the spillage happening twice.</li>
    <li> This is totally necessary to purchase with the Seche top coat. It can get very thick and gooey. A few drops of this and it is back to being perfect.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing great discovery .  I had nail polishes that thickened but were still more than half full just add the suggested  amount and shake let set and it&#x27;s good to go like new. On my favorites list for sure.</li>
    <li> It took quite a bit, but I finally restored my Seche Vite back to a normal, usable consistency. Hooray! Will purchase again in the future!</li>
    <li> Works good to thin out thick polish making it usable again, no more wasted nail polish, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Restore does what it says it should do....thin and restore Seche vite  . Caveat: when using Seche vite top coat, be sure to close the cap securely.</li>
    <li> someone finally made a product for this! It works with regular polish also, not just to restore my Seche top coat.</li>
    <li> It works perfect to thin out your topcoat. It only took a little and you can make it very thin which dries quicker and hardens tougher. A must have if you use the top coat!</li>
    <li> So I haven&#x27;t exactly used this product yet but Ive heard very good reviews about dropping one to two dots into your Seche Vite Fast Drying Top Coat if it starts to get gummy and it restores it to like new again. So I bought this along with a bottle of the Seche Vite Top Coat. I have confidence it will work like it says</li>
    <li> This stuff works to thin your nail polish as it the bottle starts to get old and thicker. It will extend the life of your favorite nail color, but it cannot revive a very old, dry, or separated nail polish. Only a drop or two needed to thin reasonably usable but thick nail color to a more-easy-to-spread consistency.</li>
    <li> yes the smell is strong but the product works. I even used it for my seche vite quick dry top coat and it didn&#x27;t affect the top coat at all (what i meant is that if you&#x27;re wondering that this product will weaken the quick dry polishes, it will not) your polishes will keep their ability to dry quickly. I usually use a 3/4 of the dropper to restore my super thick polishes. no dullness in the polishes afterwards and they&#x27;re applying like brand new polishes. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! i restored 17 bottles of polish and still have 3/4 of this product left. it is about palm size and is bigger than it appears in the picture. WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
    <li> This works well but I have found it takes more of the thinner than the directions indicated. This has rescued quite a few of my nail polishes. Great price is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Love this top coat!  It is now the only one I will use.  It is very convenient as it can be applied prior to the final color layer drying.  It dries the polish down through all of the coats very quickly.  My nails are touch dry in a matter of a few minutes!  Will never use another top coat again!</li>
    <li> This stuff works slightly, you really have to put a lot in to get a result.  You can use it in other polishes as well.</li>
    <li> Works great but I took a star off because of shipping issues. The super who sent my bottle didn&#x27;t make sure it was closed tightly so it arrived leaking and 3/4 full. I didn&#x27;t contact the supplier because at the price I got it for it just wasn&#x27;t worth the headache</li>
    <li> This thing does dry fast! You can touch your nails without worrying about smudging in seconds. With some of my polishes it even changes the colour and style. Which I like.</li>
    <li> Read a review about this product and since I use their top coat I thought I&#x27;d order it. I put some in my top coat and love how it made it like a new. I also added it to a few polishes I have that were goopy. Love it!</li>
    <li> I had to add more than just the 3-4 drops as recommended on the package.  Much more!  But in the end, it revitalized by Seche Vite top coat, which I adore so much.  Good investment.</li>
    <li> works on all brands and types of polishes - saved many of my older polishes that I could not use anymore!</li>
    <li> I was gifted this and tried it out today on some white polish of mine that was like paste at this point.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing! Put in 3 or so drops twice to get the perfect thickness. Now I don&#x27;t have to get rid of some of my best polishes! :-)</li>
    <li> Buy this. If you&#x27;re sick of waiting seche Vite and want a way to restore those precious last few mm this is it.</li>
    <li> i had a few polishes that were a bit thick and this was the fix amazing product !!!!! very happy</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I started out hearing good things about seche vite the top coat which was awesome too and I had heard about this from the same people.  first of all this seller rocks...came super fast...(so did my top coat from them).. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly I got it.. and a great price for what a quality product the seche stuff is.  This stuff is awesome though. It comes with a dropper and you just put like 3-5 drops in your nail polish or more if you need to and slowly roll the bottle back and forth n  It completely restores any old thick nail polish you have that you&#x27;re thinking of throwing away. I used to put  acetone or other nail polish in them which just really thinned them out and ruined them.  It says it works bc it doesn&#x27;t delute.. (I cant spell :).. ) them but it just restores the chemicals in the polish that have evaporated over time and makes it like new. It works great and its saved me a crap load of money from not having to throw away a lot of my old polishes.  I def recommend this to everyone and I also recommend the seche vite fast drying top coat too.  both are just awesome...prolly the best quality nail stuff ive ever bought and the price is unreal for what you get. I still cant believe it lol  You also get a really nice amount of product in the bottle too..Itll last you a REALLY long time. There&#x27;s just no way anybody would not like this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love Seche Vite and I would consider it my holy grail top coat if it didn&#x27;t get super thick and goopy halfway through a bottle.  Desperate for a solution I was told to try Seche Restore.  The reviews were great so I bought it without hestitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have tried for months to get this to work using Seche Restore every time I polished my nails but unfortunately the Seche Vite is still goopy.  I followed the directions but the Restore doesn&#x27;t mix in with the Vite at all.  It basically just sits on top of the Seche Vite which ruins my manicure when applied.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I won&#x27;t mani/pedi without Seche Vite. Whether or not this product works, save your resources time, money &amp; effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $14 buy the Seche Vite refill kit (4oz &amp; 1/2oz bottle). When your 1/2oz bottle gets thick, pour it out and refill it. It&#x27;s so much better to start off with fresh top coat than trying to saving an old goopy one. Do the math, 9 bottles of fresh top coat for $1.50 a bottle. No brainer![[ASIN:B0027VCNGO Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat High Shine Professional Kit 1/2oz &amp; 4oz Refill]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I reviewed this product as a top coat thinner not polish thinner. I guess I might try it if I had a polish I really wanted to restore but I don&#x27;t get that attached to specific colors and my OPI polish seldom thickens.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Need MUCH more than advised. 1-2 drops? Try 6-8&#x27; sometimes 19-12. Works great with correct &#x27;dosage&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I had been using a polish thinner successfully for years that I bought at a beauty supply.  I read about this and, based on positive reviews, decided to buy it since it is geared specifically to the Seche Vite products and is also recommended as a thinner for other brands of nail polish.  I made several attempts to use it to thin out the bottom of a bottle of Seche Vite top coat but it did NOT work.  Reread the directions.  Repeated.  Still thick and goopy.  I ended up having to throw the top coat out.  Will keep the Seche Restore to try with nail polish in the future. Hope I have better luck there!</li>
    <li> I have about 5 different clear top coat or base coat polishes,  This thnner worked perfectly with all of them, including a quick dry Revlon one, to a Rock Bottom base coat.  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it just as my bottle starts to dry up.  I&#x27;m a frequenter of seche vite and hate when it starts drying up!  With this, you&#x27;re able to add just a few drops maybe 4 or 5 and it brings the consistency right back to its original!  I love this!!!  Oh and it arrived on time as stated!!</li>
    <li> I was absolutely thrilled with the results of Seche Restore. I am a nail polish collector. I have more than some nail shops . I had some colors that I thought I would need to throw out, and the manufacturers no longer made those colors. Fortunately, this product did the trick for me. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty big bottle and brought my favorite coral color polish back to life. I love Seche Vite products - this and the top coat. Must have for everyone that does their nails.</li>
    <li> Add couple of drops to the hardened nail polish and Seche Restore makes it more liquidy, exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Inexpensive, does the job, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Has a very chemical scent to it. However since you only add couple of drops to your nail polish, once shaken you can no longer smell that specific scent</li>
    <li> Okay so I had a bottle of Seche Vite and it had been goopy for a while before (for some reason Seche Vite always dries up really fast). The other day, I pulled my brush out of the bottle and it was giving a lot of resistance. I touched the brush, and it was crusty. Turned the bottle upside-down, the Seche Vite was completely solid.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy a new bottle, but someone on here said that a bottle of the Seche Restore lasted a long, long time and that I could also use it to thin my polishes. I had another bottle of goopy top coat, Essie&#x27;s Good To Go, that could use some thinning so I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually takes quite a while for the Seche Restore to take effect. Once it arrived, I tested it on the crusty, dry brush from the Seche Vite bottle. Since I&#x27;d pulled it out of the solid Seche Vite, it had been sitting on top of the Seche Vite and had been bent quite out of shape. I put a couple of drops in a bottle cap, and with some massaging and soaking, it was good as new in a few minutes. So I put a couple of drops in my Essie and Seche top coats, spun them around.&lt;br /&gt;It actually takes quite a while for the Restore to mix in with the top coats -- I could see swirls from the different consistencies of the Essie/Restore for quite a while; I just let it sit for a few hours, then spun it between my hands and added some more Restore, repeating until I was satisfied. For the Essie, it took about a day to get it to a good consistency. I went from so thick that it wouldn&#x27;t drip off the brush and would leave little dry strands wherever it touched (like hot glue or spider webs) to like-new consistency.&lt;br /&gt;For the Seche Vite, it took a lot more time and effort, which was expected since it was COMPLETELY SOLID. Since it couldn&#x27;t really mix together, I just let the Restore sit on top of the Vite (the bottle was about half-full when I started). A few hours later, a few millimeters of the Vite had softened enough that the brush could sink through that part. It was still extremely thick, but it was progress. I added more, let it sit, and spun it in my hands when the non-solid part of the Vite was thin enough for me to do so.&lt;br /&gt;3 days and 3/4 a bottle of Seche Restore later, my Essie Good to Go and Seche Vite top coats were good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because that took A LOT of time and Seche Restore, but it worked and I have enough left over to somewhat thin out a few polishes (assuming the Restore doesn&#x27;t dry up by then -- if it eventually dries up when mixed in with the Seche Vite, I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t do the same in the bottle of Restore). But then again, it got my completely solid Seche Vite to a useable consistency, so that&#x27;s honestly pretty impressive.It was still extremely thick, but it was progress.

    <li> I received the drop brush broken&lt;br /&gt;This is not fair 👎👍</li>
    <li> works perfectly will certainly buy again. works on all my nail polishes and now even my oldest polishes are like new!</li>
    <li> This is still the best top coat out there and everyone knows it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. The only problem is that if your nail polish is super clumpy, just throw the nail polish away. It will not work, it will stay clumpy.</li>
    <li> It works exactly as promised. The Seche Vite top coat starts to get thick when you use about half the bottle and this restores it to it&#x27;s original viscosity no matter how little is left in the bottle. Definitely worth it. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> It really does work, but be patient. It seems to integrate best when you add to the bottle and then continually roll, not shake, around.</li>
    <li> Great product works great.  Will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I have quite a few bottles of SV laying around and I am so glad I finally got this. It&#x27;s the only way to restore SV but more than that you can use it to thin out and restore polish as well. No more throwing away polish and wasting money on new bottles of SV! This is a must!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you have more nail polish than you really can use before it gets thick and gloppy.  This does think it out and restores it for more use.  You may have to add a few drops each time you go to use the polish though - seems to thicken again quickly.</li>
    <li> This works for just about any polish, and works GREAT!  just a few drops from the dropper into sticky polish, a nice shake up, and Viola!!!!  The polish is like brand new!  It&#x27;s really amazing and worth every penny. It will save you a TON of cash on nail polish. It comes in very handy when mixing your own colors as well. Helps blend them together nicely.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!  A+++++</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed but wasn&#x27;t exactly disappointed entirely, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some polishes just need to be tossed, only try this as a last resort.</li>
    <li> This shipped promptly and did thin out my nail polish since it became a thick consistency after multiple uses. I would recommend buying this but would have preferred the dropper be apart of the cap not an add-on. Other than that it was a good product. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Took only a few days. Bigger bottle than I expected. Gonna last me a long, long time. Worked well on my seche vite top coat.</li>
    <li> The best quick drying product on the market.</li>
    <li> Not only didn&#x27;t it thin or restore my Seche-Vite top coat, it ruined it! My topcoat wont dry now and stays sticky and its been 2 days worth of drying time. I used 2-3 drops as the directions instructed, and the whole bottle has to be trashed! Returns with are also very difficult, and I&#x27;m currently in limbo to see if they&#x27;ll even go through. I&#x27;m so irritated with this product and return experience I could scream! I wish I could give the product 0 stars. Its absolute junk! I wasted my money buying it, and now I have to go and buy a new top coat!</li>
    <li> Came packed well. Have used regular nail polish thinner in my seche vite before with unsatisfactory results. This works! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This restorer works well but only with the Seche Vite quick dry.  I tried using nail polish remover and it doesn&#x27;t work the same.  A definite must have.</li>
    <li> Was thinking it would be a mess. But packaged in a box. Dropper and all. If you want to keep your top and bottom coat of seche from that thick stringy mess it can become,than this is a must have for you!</li>
    <li> I could not figure out how to use it</li>
    <li> I am impatient and never wait long enough for my nails to dry, so I was always messing them up.  This Seche Top Coat is amazing!!  I can go back to using my fingers like normal in 10 minutes without messing up my nails.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many topcoats but this one goes extend the life of my polish. It&#x27;s a bit thick and u gotta get the hang of applying but it really is great. Love the shine n glossiness. I do get shrinkage when I don&#x27;t apply right. But over all it is a wonderful product that makes your nail color last.</li>
    <li> Works great.  My top coat was old because I bought it last year and when I opened it it was very thick and difficult to apply.  A few drops of restore and it was just like a new one.</li>
    <li> I love everything about Sache Vite Top Coat except for the goopyness that eventually develops.  This thinner absolutely does the trick.  Very happy I decided to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is magical!!! Before i found this I always felt like i would waste polish but this will make it thinner and not all goopy after a long period of time.</li>
    <li> It works well, but there&#x27;s not very much of it. After I use it in my Seche Vite, it&#x27;s still not it&#x27;s original consistency.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is supposed to do - makes the nail polish thinner. Will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> it thinned my Seche Vite a bit but did not restore it like the name suggests. I have not tried it on any other polish but right now I am far from wowed over this product.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed to get my Seche Vite back to it&#x27;s original state. I hated to waste a half of a bottle of it &amp; this was exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I wish that it would thin the Seche Vite out but it states that it wont. So overall it is fine.</li>
