<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the Wen products. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year. I have very fine long  hair and this stuff is great. Not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down at all.  In the past I had prone to split ends. NOT ANY MORE. Wen actually makes my hair stronger.&lt;br /&gt;But I use way less than what it says to on the bottle. You really don&#x27;t need that much tof do the same job and it will last you longer.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your beautiful hair.&lt;br /&gt;Lois</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite scent, however I did get the pumpkin ginger spice one today and I can&#x27;t wait to use it. I love all the wen products and I can&#x27;t imagine not using them, my hair is always so soft...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  smells amazing...leaves my hair happy!</li>
    <li> I have medium to thick waves and also have color treated hair that has a tendency to be very dry , brittle and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is now soft and full of bounce !</li>
    <li> makes my hair manageable love it</li>
    <li> This is okay but, it doesn&#x27;t have the same ingredients as when you buy from the actually &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; site.  It is missing the word water (aqua).</li>
    <li> My wife loves this particular Wen product more than any other. She has tried the other fragrances (sp?) and howls with joy on this one. (Baffles me!!). But she enjoys it so very much I just suggest you try this one and compare it to the other ones offered by Wen. And yes, she swears (in a good way!) by Wen products.</li>
    <li> I love WEN, but the fruit flavors are too sweet for my liking. For ex, pomegranate, pumpkin and orange are also too sweet. It is just me... I LOVE all the other flavors though and how the cleansing conditioner makes my hair feel. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Works great smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen products for approximately 3 years now. I haven&#x27;t used shampoo since I started using Wen and my hair is in the best condition. My favorite Wen is pomegranate and tea tree.  I would recommend Wen you won&#x27;t be disappointed but you must use the recommended amount and leave it on as long as possible and rinse well &#x3D; fantastic hair!</li>
    <li> wen is the only product i ever use</li>
    <li> This product smells great and feels great on the scalp but my hair looked greasy (as if I hadn&#x27;t washed it in weeks) after about 3 days of use.  This would be good for those with dry hair, I think, but for people with average hair, it was awful.  I honestly can&#x27;t give it away.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, works very well and scent is amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for almost 2 months now and I can see a big improvement in my hair already. It is thicker, shinier and has been growing quicker than ever. I love the tingling from the mint on my scalp. The only thing i will say is it has left my hair feeling oily at times but a little dry shampoo in between shampoos has been a great fix for me.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Really works!!!</li>
    <li> have used wen for a long long time and really do appreciate all it does for my hair....</li>
    <li> I love buying WEN products through Amazon because there is no auto-ship requirement, like there is on the WEN website. I also like to be able to change my selections whenever I want. This new Cranberry Mint product smells really great and it works wonderfully cleansing your hair while not stripping the life out of it, and making it dryer. WEN leaves your hair feeling full, bouncy and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love,love ,love I have hair extensions and love the way it makes them look and feel</li>
    <li> I love WEN hair products</li>
    <li> ITS SO BAD DOESNT WORK AT ALL!!</li>
    <li> All the Wen products smell delicious, but this one smells the best.&lt;br /&gt; Mt hair feels amazing with Wen, normally i have thick dry hair, but this makes it silky smooth.. I will never use another shampoo or conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling Wen products I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few). Unlike some of the other that have more of the earthy spa smell, this is predominantly cranberry. A nice light sweet flavor.</li>
    <li> I first tried Wen a few years ago when my sister bought it for me as a Christmas present.  I didn&#x27;t feel then like it really cleaned my hair, but for some reason I decided to try it again.  I really love the scent and the tingly feel the mint gives.  I also use it a little differently than before, adding water as instructed and then I scrub it around like regular shampoo, then comb it through.  Previously I just slathered it in and combed it through with no added water.  It cleans perfectly fine now.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave the product only 3 stars is one, the price.  It is roughly $30 for hair wash. Although it does replace shampoo and conditioner, the price is still daunting.  Secondly, the amount of product the instructions recommend you use is, in my opinion, excessive.  I have used the amount recommended, and I have used the amount necessary to saturate my hair, and there is no difference in the outcome.  I am already suspicious of businesses and this just makes me feel like they are trying to gouge customers by making them purchase more product more often.  They also suggest you &amp;#34;rinse and repeat&amp;#34; which again just seems like a ploy to get you to use more product, and I have also tried and saw no difference in the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does the job and probably leaves your hair a little softer, shinier and less static-ridden than normal shampoo, but not sure it&#x27;s worth the added cost incurred.</li>
    <li> I have been using WEN for about 5 years, and am happy to have the Cranberry Mint selection, too.  Am glad I was able to find it available.</li>
    <li> This scent is so refreshing! I also mix this with half the pumps of the Wen Sixthirteen. They work very well together and the results are super. I have very thin, fine hair and it makes it feel fuller without flyaways. I love all of the Wen cleansing conditioners!</li>
    <li> The smell was nice and as with all of the WEN cleansing conditioners, it left my hair feeling wonderful. Fabulous product!</li>
    <li> I have been using wen for 3 years. You must use as directed and it is a little fussy at first bit the long term benefits are unseniable. I have mom using it and my best friend started using it after her hair got after thin. People comment on my hair all the time!</li>
    <li> Really happy with purchase. Product arrived very quickly. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen cleansing conditioner for 2 years and I am able to grow my hair from a bob cut to all the way down my waist line.  My hair is so much healthier and thicker now.  I have never gotten a bad bottle before.  This was my first time purchasing from this Seller and it is not the same as the other Wen products that I  have gotten in the past. The one I got from this seller is very thick and the pump doesn&#x27;t work but the cranberry mint scent is light and pretty.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same product that I am accustomed to.  It might be some sort of after market product or it could have been very old.  I am disappointed and am returning it for a refund.  It is best to buy directly from Wen, you&#x27;ll pay more but it&#x27;s the real stuff and it works!  I am 54 years old and have not been able to grow my hair long for the past 10 years until I started to use Wen.</li>
    <li> I love wen and the way this product it makes my hair look and feel. The new smell is also wonderful</li>
    <li> This stuff does not clean your hair.  My hair is a greasy dirty mess no matter how much of it I use and how well I wash it out. I have damaged dry hair from bleaching and drying and straightening it every day. I wanted to bring moisture back but now it&#x27;s like a limp noodle.</li>
    <li> This product makes a big difference from what I used before...And smells fantastic too. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love the Wen cleansing conditioners. I have long very fine hair. It used to be brittle. Now my hair is soft, shiny and healthy. I was very cautious when I first used this because I was certain it would make my hair greasy and flat. Even though I discontinued the automatic shipment deal directly with Wen (because I disagreed with their math) I could not imagine not using this to clean my hair! The Cranberry Mint has a fresh clean scent to it. It works every bit as well as the other fragrances I have tried.</li>
    <li> fragrant, seems to be better than the almond mist.  Controlled my hair (salt and pepper) so much better, why, don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> This is a seasonal scent and event though the winter vanilla is gone, I like this one almost as much!  This formula is good for my thick, Asian hair and I like the berry/mint scent. I have been using Wen for years and at first I didn&#x27;t like it because I though I was losing more hair, but I was just using too much  of it.  What people do not realize is that you must use it sparingly.  You only need a few pumps depending on your hair length as it does not later, you need to just rub it into your scalp and through the end of your strands with a wide tooth comb.  If you use too much, it will get oily especially at your roots,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how Wen my hair strong and less prone breakage.  It is also very gentle if you color your hair.  My hairstylist always comments on my hair and asks what I use.  She says she hates the Wen guy, but she sees that his product works just by my hair. lol!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product 5 stars but it is a little too pricey in my opinion. It does, however, work great! I have long, naturally curly, colored hair and this makes it so soft and shiny. I continue to use my regular shampoo and use this as a conditioner. I also use it as a leave in conditioner and sometimes use it on my hair after it&#x27;s styled to help with the dryness. It&#x27;s not heavy or oily and does not weigh my hair down. This is a fantastic product and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Another great product from wen smells nice clean hair try it</li>
    <li> This was described to help with frizzy hair, wrong.  Did not work on mine.  I am trying another of their products, to see if it works, so far it seems to be.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wen. I am never disappointed with wen products. The scent is great too. If you are not sure if it&#x27;s worth the money try it, you&#x27;ll like it :)</li>
    <li> The scent is similar to the original almond mint with a hint of winter flavors. Definitely wished I purchase more of this.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me a bottle about a year ago. Tried using regular shampoo again but no way. Went back to wen. Never using shampoo or gel  on these curls again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo. I have used it for years, great for your hair. Excellent products made by wen.</li>
    <li> I love how soft and healthy this has made my hair look and feel.  I also never feel like my hair is dirty looking or feeling.  I probably use this product only 1-2 per week but my hair does not look, feel, or smell greasy ever.  Do not skimp on this product.  I feel like when I did try to use less my hair looked greasy so you must follow the directions precisely.  I did feel like it helped with my split ends some too.</li>
    <li> This is the &amp;#34;fake wen&amp;#34; everyone warns you to beware of when not buying direct from QVC or Chaz Dean.  Smells great, but it&#x27;s just not Wen.  I noticed right away that the packaging was different from all of my other 16oz bottles.  This bottle is actually taller than all of the 16oz bottles I have gotten from QVC when Chaz Dean is on TV.  I was going to just use it anyway but I notice that I am losing a lot of hair in the drain with this Amazon Wen version.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with my other Wen.  Could be coincidence, but I am not going to risk it.</li>
    <li> I have no preference on the scent, but I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using wen. My hair is amazing. I get compliments all of the time, even from men. My hair is super shiny and between haircuts, it never looks full. People always ask me if I just got a hair cut, even when it&#x27;s been months in between. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Leaves hair feeling soft. Color lasts longer in color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I love Wen products! It works so good on my hair. (Long brunette hair down my back, fine in texture). The smell of the Cranberry Mint is so good. It has a clean, crisp and slightly sweet smell. I love it! It&#x27;s only for a limited time so I&#x27;m going to have to stock up!!! :)</li>
    <li> I like the performance and the texture but the fragrance was not really what I expected. The Sweet Almond Mint is much better.</li>
    <li> the container was sealed - but when I put the pump in - it oozed out - messy&lt;br /&gt;I used an OLD wen pump</li>
    <li> I finally have found the solution for my curly hair!  no more frizz for me!  Leaves my hair clean and shiny but not dry.</li>
    <li> I love this scent but the pumps always break is it just my dumb luck?</li>
    <li> I tried the Sweet Almond Mint and was not very impressed. It left my hair greasy and flat. I tried the Winter Cranberry Mint and Voila! My hair was shiny, bouncy and the comb slid through my hair effortlessly after I washed it. The smell is wonderful and the only thing I am wondering after using this is &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34; is my next bottle coming?</li>
    <li> Pump did not work so I couldn&#x27;t accurately measure the amount needed for my hair. While the product smelled lovely, it did not work for my coarse, curly hair.  After three uses, my hair felt like it had residue in it. My curls were flat. My hair was harder to manage. In addition , it added more time to my shower and when you&#x27;re in a rush in the morning, there is no time for the second shampoo.  I felt like I was overdoing it with the shampooing and rinsing, repeating, and leaving some as a leave in conditioner. Way too much. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This has a fresh and unique scent.  It makes my hair soft and very shiny.  I just love the way it feels and behaves!</li>
    <li> smells awesome, deeply conditions and provide a source of moisture for dry ,soft hair!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I purchased two so that my daughter could try one. She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Just for the record, I have 3 daughters. I may have to get a couple more soon. Thxs again</li>
    <li> This product is highly over rated especially for the price. I would not recommend. My hair does not feel clean and it leaves it feeling oily. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  I find that I also lose less hair after cleaning.  I will buy it again and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have been a Wen girl for awhile and use the Pomegranate due to the coloring my hair goes through. I saw this and decided to give it a try. WOW! The scent is fantastic and that little bit of mint makes it tingle on your scalp. It has made this crap winter more tolerable and helped keep my hair happy!! Thank you Chaz Dean!!</li>
    <li> I have used Wen products for some time now and decided to purchase this over the holidays.  I have a LOT of hair but it is very fine and long (to my lower back).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must mention that the smell of this product is great, you can definitely pick out the cranberry mint scent but it is not intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I typically stick to the standard Sweet Almond Mint, I&#x27;ve tried many others and most seem to be about the same consistency.  This product seems to be much thicker than others that I have tried and much more moisturizing, which works for me in the winter but may be too heavy for a lot of people.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Okay.  If you have lots of money get it and use it; if not, go buy Pantene.  It does make my hair soft and manageable but I feel like it gets greasy quick with this product.  It is very expensive and I do think I get as good a job from my regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair never grew and was thinning out until I started using WEN a couple years ago. My hair is thicker and continues to grow at a good pace. I have it trimmed every 6 weeks. I am almost 57 years old. When women age their hair thins and stops growing like it did when they were younger.You know how they say you should change out your shampoo every 2 weeks to keep your hair in the best shape; well I don&#x27;t have to with WEN. It&#x27;s the only shampoo I use at home. My hairdresser uses Enjoy which is great as well. However WEN lasts forever and I save a ton of money having the shampoo and conditioner in one bottle and the creamy formula goes further. I am so happy I found it. I will not use any other product on my hair. Also I don&#x27;t have to shampoo as often as I did in the past to keep my hair looking healthy. Heads up to WEN.</li>
    <li> Love it so far. used it once.</li>
    <li> I love Wen and this may be my favorite scent - it&#x27;s got a ripe burst of fruitiness and a pervasive mint scent, which make for a lovely combination.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  My hair is soft and manageable.  No flyaways or frizz.  Wish this scent was an everyday choice instead of seasonal!</li>
    <li> I have used WEN products for years and love them.  They work great for my unmanageable hair and I share it with my husband who uses it for voluminizing.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite!!! My most recent favorite (longtime favorite) has been Fig. I will be buying this for now on.</li>
    <li> I will not wash my hair with anything else ever again&lt;br /&gt;if you dont try it you will never know what it feels like to have lovely shiny hair with no product that lasts for days&lt;br /&gt;no frizz, no tangles and my style stays just how I like it between washes</li>
    <li> The price was more than reasonable and the product arrived as it should have.</li>
    <li> Not as great as advertised. My regular shampoo works just as well and is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Did not care for the smell, used 6 pumps of cleansing cream and felt like it was too much, also felt oily sooner then other shampoos.  But... Love how my hair feels &amp; it does seem more healthy and less flyaways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been over-processing my hair one way or another for decades, and my hair was crispy and frizzy to begin with.  Every time I went to the hairdresser, I left with armloads of hair-care products, none of which appreciably helped my hair.  A colleague at work mentioned Wen products, and I ordered one bottle without expecting much.  Seriously, I noticed a difference the VERY FIRST TIME I USED IT.  I told my colleague that it seemed to take forever to blow-dry my hair that morning, until I realized that my hair WAS dry, it just didn&#x27;t feel like it.  I was accustomed to knowing my hair was dry when it felt like a haystack, but it didn&#x27;t ever feel that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wash your hair every day, but just wet it down every other day, and adjust the amount you use to what works for you.  It&#x27;s amazing.  And as for the cost, since I no longer use gallons of other conditions and smoothers, I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m spending more on this product than I did on the vast array of other items I used to use.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works wonderful! Very happy with Wen cleansing conditioners</li>
    <li> If you like the WEN hair products, and I do, then this one will not disappoint.  The fragrance is delicious while using it in the shower but doesn&#x27;t stick around all day which is fine with me.  Same great cleaning power and super soft hair as always.</li>
    <li> I love WEN&lt;br /&gt;My hair is better in every way when I use WEN.  This was a new scent for me and I like it a lot.  Its not a problem but it feels just a little different than the Pomegranate scent I usually get.  It is amazing to me that this cleansing conditioner cleans so well without the foaming and lathering that we are used to with shampoos.  A couple times I have used shampoo/conditioner in place of this and I regret it as my hair is noticeably drier and less manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes WEN is expensive but honestly worth it.  I only need one product in the shower (instead of shampoo, conditioner and leave-in conditioner) and out of the shower only maybe a little Moroccan oil for styling the ends.</li>
    <li> Wen products work well with my hair, not like shampoos that strip an dry my hair. I have a reoccurring delivery through Wen; I just prefer to buy extra bottles through Amazon because Amazon&#x27;s shipping is hassle-free. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Wen girl for 2 years and won&#x27;t use anything else again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I love the way it smells and it leaves my hair silky and untangled. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> A became a Wen girl immediately after using the Wen Fall Apple Spice Cleaning Conditioner. After I used the bottle up (in a little over a month) I ordered more Wen. Decided I would try another fragrance the next time. Got the Wen Winter Cranberry Cleansing Conditioner. Don&#x27;t like it. My hair is more flat and looks horrible the second day. I thought that all Wen was created equal and the only difference was the fragrance choice, not so! I also don&#x27;t like that if you are in the shower and the Wen runs into your eyes, the Mint in the Wen Winter Cranberry Mint stings my eyes. Would not buy again!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and the way my hair feels and it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and hair conditioner all in one!</li>
    <li> I have used Wen in the past and stopped because of the price.  I started up using it again and found that it made my hair greasy and flat.  I always follow the directions, so that wasn&#x27;t the problem.  I don&#x27;t know if they changed the ingredients or something, but it isn&#x27;t the same as when I used it a few years back.  I do like the fragrance and it leaves your scalp and hair feeling wonderful, but not enough to purchase it again.  A biggest problem with Wen now as in the past when I used it, is that it clogs your drains with a white waxy substance.  I used Liquid Plumber every week to help with this problem.  This product isn&#x27;t worth the money and the cost of the Liquid Plumber.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Wen products. I will never switch back to these original &amp;#34;lathering&amp;#34; shampoos. My hair is so much softer and stronger and healthier. I highly recommend Wen for ANY hair type!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product was a copy of WEN or what,  I have used WEN for TWO YEARS on the auto ship.  Never had my hair ever been oily but after the first use my hair was dull,  flat and greasy.  So i tried it again the second day,  I had to use my original almond mint and all is fine again.  I wanted to try a different scent but if quality changes then i will stay with autoship. As far as shipping I received my product very fast, speedy shipper.  The label,  bottle and pump was all a different quality than the original WEN also.</li>
    <li> Heavier wen cleansing conditioner. I have fine Asian hair and it gets greaser more easily with this product but it is much more moisturizing than the other Wen products I have tried. I didn&#x27;t have to use any for leave in. It smells great, has a slight tingle but the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long. Overall good product and I am excited to use it more later in the winter.</li>
    <li> Different ... it doesn&#x27;t lather.  But my thinning hair looks fuller and healthier.</li>
    <li> Not sure I like the fruity smell.  I definitely prefer the almond mint.  Also, my hair seems listless and I will probably use this shampoo every other day or so.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing Cleansing/Shampoo.  I really does keep the shine to my color treated hair longer......and my hair is much more healthier and fuller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked!! Love this stuff it is all I use, makes you hair so soft and Shiney and smells great!</li>
    <li> Works great,just not as nice of a smell as the othrrs i have tried.</li>
    <li> I am Wen girl!  I mostly try various flavors.  Winter Cranberry Mint is very good.  No negative about it but I like other flavors.</li>
    <li> Smells fabulous. My hair is so soft and silky. Think I am converted to a WEN girl!</li>
    <li> Love Wen!....can&#x27;t be without this..adds so much body and shine!</li>
    <li> I am from the Caribbean, after hearing, seeing and reading alot about the Wen products, I decided to order via Amazon. Delivery was perfect, and I was really excited about using my Cranberry Mint Wen product. First time using was great! Usage and experience after the first was horrible, my hair was an oily mess. I did not use much of the product to cause build up. I have reverted to my previous shampoo and conditioner. I can&#x27;t understand why advertise something and its outcome, and it&#x27;s totally false.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this particular scent of Wen cleansing Conditioner, but I love the product and how it makes my hair feel, especially in the wintertime when I usually have so much electricity in my hair. There is absolutely no electricity in my hair using this product and so allows me to grow my hair longer.</li>
    <li> Okay, I love the WEN since I tried it over a year ago. I find that it is much more practical to buy it on AMAZAON, otherwise you get sucked into WEN delivering you a new supply every month despite the fact that you cancelled the order. I have tried the original and now the Cranberry, which smells delightful. WEN is what the infomercial tells you. It makes your hair look gorgeous and helps to retain hair color. I have had to use regular shampoo on occasion and it sucked. Also, remember to experiment with how much you use. I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as many pumps as they recommend. I have a lot of hair but it is quiet fine and cut in a bob style. I use one (maybe 1.5) pumps, add to wet hair and concentrate on ends. Then I rinse well and use 1 more pump. Hint: If you hair is greasy after WEN that means you did not use it right. After you add it to your hair and work it around, lean back a get some water on that head. Then work it through your hair and you will feel it start to bloom. It does not foam like shampoo, but when it starts to bloom you can tell....feels almost like right before your shampoo starts to foam. Also, it is always a good idea to do the final rinse of your hair with cold water. It helps prolong color, closes cuticles which cuts down on oil and makes your hair shiny and not frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have been using wen for over 3 years. I&#x27;m so happy I found this product. Nothing makes my hair feel softer, smoother, and healthier. I love trying new products but Wen is always a staple in my collection. By far the best cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Not too slick so it really feels like it&#x27;s penetrating (whether or not I keep it in for 20 minutes, or wash out right away). I don&#x27;t like the scent of this one though, but the results are the same :-)</li>
    <li> The item came quickly in perfect described condition. This is my newest favorite scent! It is a little sweet and minty fresh. It&#x27;s a breathe of fresh air!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on this flavor of Wen Cleansing Conditioner. I was concerned when some said that it was on the thin side, mine is probably the most thick of any I have tried. And it is pretty good, but the comparisons to cough syrup left a note in my mind that I can&#x27;t get rid of. LOL! If I hadn&#x27;t read that I might not think of it now every .. single .. time .. I use it! I won&#x27;t re-order the Cranberry, but I will use it up. Disappointed that the Pumpkin was higher priced or I would have stuck with that as I had intended to purchase.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and it gets the job done. I&#x27;ve tried the almond mint, fig, and pumpkin spice Wen, and out of all of those this winter cranberry mint one is my favorite so far. As far as the texture of my hair after I use it...it&#x27;s just regular. Can&#x27;t really say it does something amazing to my hair, but I can say that I love that Wen products are sulfate-free and that really does make a huge difference as far as care for your hair. My color doesn&#x27;t fade and the Wen does keep it vibrant. I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been used Wen for 2 years and it is the only product that works on my hair extensions.&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Smells good, works great for hair affected by hypothyroidism.</li>
    <li> I have tried several of the WEN products and overall the results appear to be the same. Hair feels softer and less tangled, however I cant really say that I prefer one over the other.</li>
    <li> wen did a good job on my hair, it shine and it makes you so beautiful , I couldn&#x27;t  buy  wen from Wen, its high price , but Amazo make it that I could buy it. Thank you AMAZO. Keep the price down .</li>
    <li> Love it, everything I expected</li>
    <li> I have used other wen products and liked them. this formula left my hair very limp, I ended up throwing away most of it</li>
    <li> I love WEN products, as I am a girl with natural hair. The smell is devine!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful product with very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. Maybe this product is old and past it&#x27;s shelf life, because it did nothing for my hair. I am disappointed because I loved the Wen Almond Mint Co Wash. I assumed I would get the same soft, detangled results but I got the total opposite. Wish I could return this product.</li>
    <li> I liked the Almond mint better.  There wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with it, I just liked the fragrance better and I feel the Almond mint moisturized better.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. This is one of my favorite Wen scents. Shipping was fast and product arrived in good condition with pump.</li>
    <li> It is OK but I didn&#x27;t get the results others have said they got from this. It actually made my hair too soft and it got flat, the waves and curls didn&#x27;t show up as well. This doesn&#x27;t lather at all, I didn&#x27;t expect a lather but I did expect that it would slightly lather maybe? I find it hard to spread throughput my hair and scalp and end up using more than the bottle says? My hair is just a little below my shoulders so it isn&#x27;t overly long. I think this works better as a conditioner than as a shampoo, unless I use more than said my hair still feels dirty and the hairspray is still in it.</li>
    <li> l love Wen but not this scent.  I was disappointed when I used it the first time. It reminded me of the cough medicine I had as a child.  Sorry Wen....The product is great but not this scent.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of cranberriers and mint together, my hair feels so soft and smells great, most definitely met my expectations.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells fabulous!  I tried Wen years ago and I felt it flattened my thin hair so I didn&#x27;t purchase it again.  My friend swears by it and encouraged me to try it again.  I think I wasn&#x27;t rinsing out it right before because now I love WEN!!  I had been buying the Almond and saw this one was a few dollars less so I bought it.  I am not disappointed at all.  For me, the key is giving your hair the final rinse with cool water to make sure it is all out.</li>
    <li> I am a Wen user, and have tried a few different ones.  You can definitely get results that are not the same between the diff \\&quot; scents \\&quot;.  Six 13 is the most moisturizing in my opinion, but also the weightiest.  I had just finished using Six13 and decided to try this Cran/mint. I like the way the menthol ( I guess) leaves my scalp feeling refreshed. The smell is ok...kind of invigorating.   This one left my hair feeling cleaner, with lots of volume, and it rinsed &amp; styled well. Did tend to get a little frizzy as the day wore on, but thats always the way for me if it produces more volume.  Same great shine. Not as soft as with the Six 13.  I have to use the styling product afterwards with this one.  BTW...CHECKED BOTTOM OF BOTTLE...it has the WEN imprinted; bottle came sealed. This is the original.</li>
    <li> I love Wen products.  This came as expected in a timely manner</li>
    <li> My hair is thick but fine.  This shampoo has finally got it looking and feeling healthy.  No more crackly sound when I rub my hair between my fingers.  My hair is full, shiny and actually looks a lot thicker.</li>
    <li> You either like WEN, or you don&#x27;t. I happen to love it for my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> did not care for the fragrance but the product works great.</li>
    <li> hooked on WEN now; quick shipping appreciated</li>
    <li> It is fine but does not work as well for me as the vanilla mint. Wen still is the best for curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love love love WEN seasonals. Also love the 6 13 for shine and softness. So shiny and soft with wen combined.</li>
    <li> Since using it, I noticed my hair to be much manageable. My hair is softer and not too dry since using the product.</li>
    <li> Love it but I like the original scent best!  Wen is like purchasing gold it&#x27;s expensive but worth it for my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> takes some getting used to...at first you think it&#x27;s making your hair greasy ...but stick with it and use as directed ...well maybe not 12 pumps, i use three for my shoulder length hair, lather, rinse, repeat .... make sure you massage it into the root end of your hair really well,  you will be amazed at how wonderful your hair looks once it &amp;#34;gets used to&amp;#34; the new protocal  ...i got the texturizing balm also...now i&#x27;m stylin&#x27;! ...</li>
    <li> This product was ok. I didn&#x27;t really like the fragrance to much but I used it. Love the WEN product</li>
    <li> Unsure if this is an authentic WEN product. There are several inconsistencies on the label most notably there is NO &amp;#34;By Chaz Dean&amp;#34;. Also, I can find no other seller with this fragrance combination.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the product is about the same as cleansing conditioner bought through the official WEN website.</li>
    <li> I initally received this as a gift and now I buy it for myself.  It will make your hair soft shinny and healthy.  I use it as a conditioner more than as a shampoo and conditioner in one.  It lasts a long time, super thick and you only need a little.  Really like that Amazon sells it</li>
    <li> I really like this for my hair, it does not dry my hair out like regular shampoo does. It&#x27;s helping my hair. If I feel I need to do a regular shampoo from time to time, I use it like a conditioner and put some on my ends of my hair after I rinse to use as a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> All I can say is love it!  Smells AWESOME and is so gentle on my color!</li>
    <li> Kind of disappointing for all the hype and commercials,  cost is high!</li>
    <li> Love Wen!  Been devoted for years!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and just a little tingly.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this really isn&#x27;t an every day cleanser.  If you use it more than 2 days in a row, it leaves your hair looking and feeling oily.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I really like buying it on Amazon without the hassle of buying from the company. I like buying when I need it rather than when they want to send it. It softens my African hair type but is also great for my biracial daughters hair. One of my daughters has mixed race hair the other completely Caucasian with a little wave. With this we all have soft, shiny, healthy, and tangle free hair. I will definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I love the way it works and smells!!  I have very frizzy curly hair and after a month of using Ito have a lot less frizz.</li>
    <li> I used this product for many months, having short hair and having received the 32 oz size, purchased elsewhere.  It left my hair feeling smooth and smelling great; reduced cleansing frequency and stabilized my hair color between treatments.  The feeling of being able to comb through my hair after cleansing/conditioning, to be able to finger dry or blow style it and to have it feel soft and wonderful is well worth pricing.  Found it necessary, for me, to put a cap over my hair while the product was on for about 15 minutes and to warm water rinse for a full two minutes to get max effect and minimum weightiness for my fine textured aging hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Wen for over a year now and just finished my first bottle of the Cranberry combo.  Have moved on to a Summer Honey Peach, which has been waiting on the bottom shelf of the linen closet for use. One wash and I like it even more than Winter Cranberry, if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
    <li> Great scent,works beautifully.</li>
    <li> The Wen was a gift which I sent to my daughter who is abroad with our military service. I can&#x27;t speak to the product itself, although my daughter loves it and had requested it, but the quick delivery and packaging , etc. were excellent!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way that it has made my hair feel. I have long THICK hair and it is always full of static... But not since I started using WEN :)</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite flavors.  It seems to work better than some of the others.  Would definitely recommend this product to others to at least give it a try.</li>
    <li> I like it because it feels good on my scalp and I only use one thing for my hair instead of two so that is less time in the shower. It also makes my hair feel good afterwords. It&#x27;s a bit overpriced though.</li>
    <li> It smells great and does leave hair very soft, but it left my hair a bit too heavy and greasy.  I was hoping it would be just enough to fight the cold winter, but it just made my hair feel limp and heavy only after a few hours after drying.  I think this works best for those with very dry hair, or for those that blow-dry, curl, etc., regularly.  I gave it a go for 2 weeks, but now just use it to condition the ends of my hair--so it works great as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Have used these products for about 3 years now.  I will never go back! Leaves my hair so smooth and soft with no tangles after a shower.</li>
    <li> I like the Wen for my short curly hair, does a great job highlighting the natural white gray and gives it a softer look.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. And this product works wonders for hair and scalp issues. Amazon has the best prices for wen. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Not crazy about smell, but leaves hair easy to blow dry like the other formulas.</li>
    <li> Cranberry yes, mint - not that I noticed. Wen shampoo does the trick for me, but so does L&#x27;Oreal for a lot less.</li>
    <li> no strong mint feel or cranberry smell... but good cleanser.. I&#x27;m a Wen fan :)</li>
    <li> very nice and smells great!!</li>
    <li> Smells SO good! Cleans hair fine.</li>
    <li> This winter cranberry mint smell is great. I also like the summer coconut one that Wen makes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it. Made my hair so greasy- and I have thick, dark, course, long hair which is what I thought this product catered to. I only wash my hair once of a week, so if this makes my dry hair greasy then something is up with it. I know you are supposed to call in the hotline, read the directions yada yada... if it leaves your hair greasy... but, I am sorry that is just too much work for shampoo! Just use it as conditioner now and then so it&#x27;s not a complete waste.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this same scent on Amazon before - from another supplier.  This bottle seems a little thinner in consistency than my last, but I don&#x27;t know what that means, if anything.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far.  If I notice anything else, I will follow up.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Saves color too</li>
    <li> Wen is the best--I wish it had been around back in the day.  I almost was too turned off by the misleading marketing on T.V.  One G.R. (or who ever sells Chaz Dean) ad stated that for $29.99 you got all these product--I&#x27;m sure somewhere that I failed to see on the ad flashing-while trying to write down the phone number to call-I missed that $29.99 was x 3, and they would keep shipping to you every so often--never got anymore  product shipped, but I sure was charged for it.  When I disputed it with the bank, the bank agreed, but the advertising company came after me threatening to ruin my very life if I failed to pay the remaining 29.99 x 2 that was disputed. (bit of drama ;-0)  The only way to buy Chaz Dean&#x27;s Wen is on Amazon--you know what you are getting and you know what you are paying for.  Wen takes puffy frizzy hair and makes it silky and healthy.  My hairdresser even remarked on the difference in the texture of my hair since I have been using Wen.  She is kind of sad, because she doesn&#x27;t see me as often :-0</li>
    <li> Dont uderstand all the hype with Wen,  it left my hair feeling flat, dry and frizzy. The scent was ok, but nothing special. Retuned it.</li>
    <li> Product came in a tight sealed zip bag, and was exactly as pictured with the pump.  It&#x27;s a nice scent, much nicer than the original mint one.  I like the deep conditioning it does on my long, thin curly hair.  I would probably buy this again here on Amazon as I do not trust the Wen site and their automatic enrollment into their membership!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of this product. I saw the infomercial and I thought, &amp;#34; suuuuuure.&amp;#34; But for some reason, this product got sick in my head. I thought suuuure. Maybe this works for other people. But not for me. My hair is not normal and a product like this will just make my hair gross. You see, for my entire adult life I have had the misfortune of having very oily greasy hair. Really bad. My hair is also very fine. Extremely fine. It&#x27;s a bad combination.I would wash it and hours later it s grease pit. I would literally look like i hadnt showered in days. I tried lots of different shampoos. I tried no-poo. I tried just using shampoo. Just conditioner. Always the same. Add to this my scalp.... Is gross. It&#x27;s just gross. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the constant oil or what but I have some kind of psoriasis or dermatitis or something. Well, for some reason I bought this anyway despite the hefty price tag. I selected this one in particular because a few reviewers said it was lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff... Is a game changer. I&#x27;m never buying anything else and I plan for both of my daughters to use it as well. I&#x27;m serious. Buy it. It works. My hair is the best is ever been and my scalp has improved as well. I&#x27;m never buying anything else.</li>
    <li> I love WEN cleansing conditioners and have used them for several years.  The problem is they keep raising the prices and it&#x27;s becoming to expensive to buy.  I usually try to buy one bottle per season and mix it with other cleansing conditioner like Herbal Essences or Carol&#x27;s Hair Milk.</li>
    <li> Smells great, cleans good</li>
    <li> Best stuff in the world.</li>
    <li> The thing I really like about this product is it cuts down on the electricity in hair.  Other than that, it is just okay.</li>
    <li> Great product, super fast delivery. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance.  Bought it last winter as well.</li>
    <li> dont like this one but love wen products</li>
    <li> I loved it. I will use no other shampoo it is the greatest for your hair. I only have to shampoo once a week with Wen Shampoo.</li>
    <li> This my favorite scent of all the WEN seasonals.  I hope that he does not discontinue this one.  With WEN my hair is healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Works good. Even though it makes my hair soft, I occasionally still use a really conditioner for my processed hair.</li>
    <li> I like the product itself but the amount you are suggested to use is kindof crazy! I also noticed I have touse it daily which makes this way too expensive. Online I had seen reviews indicating only needing to cleanse every few days which then woukd have made this more affordable.</li>
    <li> Perfect description of product; fast shipping product met all expectations!</li>
    <li> Summer mango offers better moisture for my natural kinky curly hair but it smells amazing</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair feels, but the mint overpowers the other fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am still determining if this product is better than shampooing.  It gave my hair lots of body, but it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
    <li> Product works well, but the other fragrances are better.</li>
    <li> Love Wen and this is a nice winter set. Have lost my hair now 3 times due to chemo, always use Wen when it starts to grow back.y stylist said to never use shampoo , too harsh.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and of course, the product works as well as advertised.</li>
    <li> The mint is stronger than the cranberry, not a problem...still smells wonderful, but that is the primary scent.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent!&lt;br /&gt;The product smells fantastic, but does not give the same results as the original formula that I purchased from an authorized retailer.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I&#x27;m not sure yet whether I really notice a big distance in my hair.  That being said, if you are on a budget, I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo but not for everyday...too much conditioner.  I mix it with another and works well for a 3x week clean!</li>
    <li> I would only recommend this product to anyone. This is literally the best thing i used on my hair yet. I used to have dry, super frizzy hair. After this and cut off my split ends, it worked wonders. But the mint is soo strong, im afraid to leave it too long in my head before i loose more hair then usuall, is anyone else getting the same thing? Hairfall while showering? Maybe its just me and im not gentle enough, i should a comb instead of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only recommend this flavor and not the pomegranate one (cause the other one does not work and dries your hair)</li>
    <li> After using it for a couple of weeks, my hair felt really dry and appeared dull. I didn&#x27;t finish the bottle. Switched back to my regular shampoo and conditioner combo and won&#x27;t stray again. My hair is very fine and I tend to be dry...perhaps just not the right product for my hair type. Also didn&#x27;t like that it did not leave my hair smelling good. Though it had a fragrance, it did not last in my hair. I love the product I use. This was not &amp;#34;a find.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Made my hair fall out!</li>
