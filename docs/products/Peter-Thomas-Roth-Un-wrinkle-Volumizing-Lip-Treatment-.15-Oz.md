      <li>Product arrived earlier then original scheduled, this lip treatment has great color and made my lips</li>
      <li>Thankful for the product - not too many volumizers out there that are serious and Peter Thomas Roth seems to be the best - need darker color though</li>
      <li>Good product, the color is nice, however the container is cheap and doesn&#x27;t close tight, I wouldn&#x27;t throw it in a hand bag, it will leak.</li>
      <li>It has a nice mint flavor that&#x27;s not overboard.</li>

      <li>but I just started using my first tube, so we&#x27;ll see...</li>
      <li>AND works with a very cooling sensation....not hot, like some others.</li>
      <li>Very pricey and have not seen any results to justify this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also not sticky at all, which I really appreciate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this makes a difference in terms of volume of my lips, but overall, it&#x27;s a nice lip color!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s the same exact thing the color is &amp;#34;dolly&amp;#34; I will go back to tha buxom</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a sheer pink and is pretty alone or over another lip color.</li>
      <li>Bare minerals used to make this now it&#x27;s only sold at sephora its called &amp;#34;buxom lips&amp;#34;.</li>

    <li> It is a nice feeling gloss but I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my lips with daily usage.</li>
    <li> Love the color, love the look.  I have used many volumizing lip products, and this is the first one that really seemed to make a difference.  I&#x27;m on my second one, and will keep ordering.</li>
    <li> PTR lip products work well.</li>
    <li> Not just a lip gloss, I can feel the treatment as soon as I put it on.  Love this product......Sad its being discontinued.</li>
    <li> Eh.  Doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  I could have gotten gloss for 3 bux and it would do the same thing.</li>

    <li> Glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t bleed. Makes your lips look incredibly luscious. Great color you can even put it on over another color to create different looks. A must have in your make up bag.</li>
