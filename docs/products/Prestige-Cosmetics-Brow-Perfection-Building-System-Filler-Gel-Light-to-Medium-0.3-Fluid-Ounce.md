### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great price makes for great brows</li>
      <li>This works very good on my too light brows.  </li>
      <li>Got everything quick and in great condition.</li>
      <li>Needs a smaller brush- otherwise excellent</li>
      <li>Easy to use and colors well</li>
      <li>but i was able to learn to get it on nicely fairly quick</li>
      <li>The color was suppose to be light, but pinky-beige?  </li>
      <li>Go with a light touch.  </li>
      <li>THANKS FOR THIS FIND!!!</li>
      <li>It was just a tad darker than I had originally hoped for, but it is workable</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get this product to look natural regardless of whether I used my own make-up brushes or Prestige&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I am back to my pencil, it works way better than this!  </li>
      <li>Applying it takes a bit of trial and error to achieve desired results but worth the effort.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend loves this product and she thought the price and the shipping was well worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>The color is right for blondes but the product itself lacks cohesiveness.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and like it very much.</li>
      <li>but this really gives my eyebrows more fullness &amp; definition &amp; i am able to extend them a little too.</li>
      <li>They look weird,&amp;#34; the first time I put it on.</li>
      <li>Maybe for a night in dim light</li>
      <li>overall i  love this product esp for the price</li>
      <li>It would work well for someone who has eyebrows, but if the brows are sparse, it doesn&#x27;t really help.</li>
      <li>THIS IS SPOT ON AND IM A REAL REDHEAD...</li>
      <li>THIS IS REALLY A GRET PRODUCT..</li>
      <li>Overall it really fills in well!</li>
      <li>Nice, but it isn&#x27;t dark blond, it&#x27;s light brown, a little dark for my tastes.</li>
      <li>and it makes my brows look naturally darker and fuller.</li>
      <li>Looks incredibly natural on me.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s one terrific advantage to this product -- it really lasts.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sparse brows, I&#x27;m using this to have my brows look lush and groomed.</li>

<li> It leaves your brows crusty and not very flattering.</li>
<li> It needs to be thin like an eyeliner brush because it puts to much product on.</li>
<li> It left balls of color all over in my brows, wasted my money!</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s really not worth you money.</li>
<li> I go with the lighter shade, less aging.&lt;br</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a little tricky</li>
<li> though - I would go a shade lighter than you usually use.  </li>
<li> I use this product everyday!,,,</li>
<li> It&#x27;s pointless to waste your money ! !</li>
<li> must be giving some oomph to my look as I&#x27;ve gotten some compliments from my friends lately on my brows.</li>
<li> Brush too thick to apply correctly.</li>
<li> I found it hard to apply as the brush shape is totally wrong for eyebrows -- lashes</li>
<li> HAVE USED EXPENSIVE ONES..</li>
<li> It looks SO artificial.  </li>

    <li> Got everything quick and in great condition. My girlfriend loves this product and she thought the price and the shipping was well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> overall i  love this product esp for the price&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t used the more expensive ones so can&#x27;t compare but this really gives my eyebrows more fullness &amp; definition &amp; i am able to extend them a little too. it&#x27;s a little tricky but i was able to learn to get it on nicely fairly quick</li>
    <li> Brushes would be easier to use if they had smaller bristles. I had to use a brush from a different brow product.</li>
    <li> Go with a light touch.  Wipe excess off the wand.  It&#x27;s darker than I though - I would go a shade lighter than you usually use.  Overall it really fills in well!</li>
    <li> The color was suppose to be light, but pinky-beige?  It looks SO artificial.  I found it hard to apply as the brush shape is totally wrong for eyebrows -- lashes yes, eyebrows, no.  I looked like a doll with painted eyebrows.  My gentleman friend -- who never notices anything -- asked &amp;#34;what the heck do you have you got on your eyebrows?  They look weird,&amp;#34; the first time I put it on.</li>
    <li> It came in a packet of three. Gave them away. Brush too thick to apply correctly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and like it very much. I think it is being discontinued (it isn&#x27;t on the manufacturer&#x27;s website) so I decided to buy all eight!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and colors well</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this product to look natural regardless of whether I used my own make-up brushes or Prestige&#x27;s.  The color is right for blondes but the product itself lacks cohesiveness.</li>
    <li> This works very good on my too light brows.  I got the light/medium color and it makes my brows look naturally darker and fuller.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for every day use. It leaves your brows crusty and not very flattering. Maybe for a night in dim light but it&#x27;s really not worth you money.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s one terrific advantage to this product -- it really lasts. Doesn&#x27;t fade or smear. Actually tested it by wearing while sleeping and woke up with brows intact. Applying it takes a bit of trial and error to achieve desired results but worth the effort.</li>
    <li> It comes on in clumps and dries like chalk on your face. It&#x27;s pointless to waste your money ! !</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday!,,,</li>
    <li> Like this product except the brush. It needs to be thin like an eyeliner brush because it puts to much product on.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sparse brows, I&#x27;m using this to have my brows look lush and groomed. Looks incredibly natural on me.

    <li> THIS IS REALLY A GRET PRODUCT.. HAVE USED EXPENSIVE ONES.. THIS IS SPOT ON AND IM A REAL REDHEAD... THANKS FOR THIS FIND!!!</li>
