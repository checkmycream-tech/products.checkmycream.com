      <li>This is a super product!</li>

      <li>I have had more success with the Konad plates.</li>
      <li>Oh, and the corrector pen is great to have even for when youre using regular polish!</li>
      <li>kit comes with a correction pen (haven&#x27;t tried this out yet), 2 bottles of stamping polish (black and white-awesome stamping polish!), a stamper, a scraper, and 3 awesome plates.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to stamp now</li>
      <li>It takes practice, but it is worth it!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and fun.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter if I use acetone-based polish remover to clean the disk/stamper.  </li>
      <li>Great product, takes a couple tries to get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, but it takes time to get the hang of getting the French manicure on straight.</li>
      <li>fast because the polish dries quickly (this is great because there is virtually no wait time while waiting for your nails to dry)</li>
      <li>We love this kit, very complete, exctly what it shows on the descrpition, I do recommened it.</li>
      <li>Lord knows Im CONSTANTLY painting more than I should!</li>
      <li>At first when i got this item i thought that it would be easy to use because i had first seen it at vegas</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am going to have so much fun with this.</li>
      <li>Its a lot of fun, and</li>
      <li>after problem solved I am enjoying doing my nail, explore the new designs and rally have fun for the first time</li>
      <li>It shipped quickly and arrived on the first delivery estimated date.</li>
      <li>right remember Massage your stamper!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, the BIG PROBLEM was the stamper didn&#x27;t pick up at all, even i tried many time..</li>
      <li>I am able to use my regular nail polish and have no problems with it.</li>
      <li>But overall, I love it.</li>
      <li>I first saw this while on vacation in Vegas-</li>
      <li>Works very well!</li>
      <li>I have a set of bundle monster stamps and these are the first Konad plates and polish I used.  </li>
      <li>i really recommend it!</li>
      <li>I was happy with the polish, but you can use other kinds as long as your quick about it.</li>
      <li>So I used my own brand name nail polish on the Konad plate design, I brushed on a clear coat and it did not cause any design smears.</li>
      <li>Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a great looking french manicure.</li>
      <li>I have always wanted to be able to do my own french manicure but was never able to get it right</li>
      <li>that well like using a pure acetone.</li>
      <li>but it cost to much</li>
      <li>It just didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
      <li>Item shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how fast I move.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how much I knead the removed stamper surface.  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t always stamp a whole design on your nail,</li>
      <li>Be prepared to spend a little time getting used to using the stencil (it works better if you wipe it and the stamper with acetone first).</li>
      <li>I have did my own french nails for a very long time..</li>
      <li>So if you have a larger nail surface, Konad plates might serve you better if you are looking to stamp things like french manicure tips or whole nail</li>
      <li>Perfect for your french manicure, and a little variation for those of you who like to add a little flair to their designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very cool nail product, but need a little practice before you can really know how to use it.</li>
      <li>Somehow my order arrived so fast for $18 you got 3 Konad plates, 1 scraper, 1 stamper, 1 black special konad polish, 1 white special konad polish, 1 french tip pen corrector and lucky me the seller gave me 2 Konad holiday plates</li>
      <li>I would recomend only because after all the hard work my nails looked really nice!</li>
      <li>It is so much fun to create different looks for your nails.  </li>
      <li>, it came pretty much at the same time with Konad kit</li>
      <li>Im glad I did and paid much less here!</li>
      <li>I am new to the stamping world.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Item shipped fast. It took a few tries to line it up w my nail, but then it&#x27;s a piece of cake! Instead of it taking an hr to do my nails, it now only takes twenty minutes!</li>
    <li> There is no comparison between these \\&quot;special\\&quot; polishes and \\&quot;regular\\&quot; polish from different brands. Konad \\&quot;special\\&quot; polish works like no other I&#x27;ve tried. Any issues or difficulty I had before I bought this polish were solved once I used the Konad polish. It&#x27;s super easy to stamp now and I absolutely LOVE it! The french tip kit is great because it comes with everything you need for great looking fun tips! I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! Now I&#x27;m addicted and will be purchasing a miriad of different \\&quot;special\\&quot; polish colors!</li>
    <li> I love that I got this for a great price... and I&#x27;m so glad to have two bottles of the special polish.  I just am having so much trouble using it!</li>
    <li> For under $20, you get two of the most used colors, three awesome image plates, scraper, stamper and correction pen. This was my very first Konad kit and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. Everything you need and you get beautiful results. It does take some getting used to. I learned and still forget sometimes that you are not supposed to push the stamper with a lot of force on the plate, as no polish will come up. After I bought this kit, I bought more image plates. I love it!! Can&#x27;t beat the price for all that you get in this package.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment, great item, and I would buy again from this Store. The item is brand new and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> At first when i got this item i thought that it would be easy to use because i had first seen it at vegas but it cost to much so i didnt purchase it, when i got it i had a very hard time to stamp my nails after trying it for at least 2 weeks i got the hang of it and i was able to get the hang of it. all you need is practice dont give up because i was going to give up myself but it takes patience. i really recommend it!</li>
    <li> One of the better stamping kits on the market, but you really have to get the technique down for it to work properly. The polish lasted about a week an a half under normal wear and tare, so it is decent quality. I would recommend this to friends who are looking for a DIY French Manicure set. I used this on my natural nails of course.</li>
    <li> This is a super product! Easy to use, once you get the hang of it. Go to YouTube for tutorials. I did my nails and then my nieces and we love our manicures! I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> I loved everything that came with the kit!  I did notice that when I used either the special black and white polishes for the design, the polish bleed a lot more after I brushed a clear nail polish coat over the design.  So I used my own brand name nail polish on the Konad plate design, I brushed on a clear coat and it did not cause any design smears.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. It was very easy to apply and dried instantly. I had a little trouble with getting it on the stamper at first because it was drying too fast, but all I had to do was turn the ceiling fan off and I was good to go.</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly, was well packaged and as described.  Will be ordering more.  I had my daughter over to play with them and she left with a couple of the plates...but then, I am sure she will be ordering some too!  What a perfect reasonable way to spend a mother daughter day, making memories, learning new money saving skills and simply enjoying each others company.  Recommend for mothers and daughters of all ages.</li>
    <li> I was so exited to try this product, I had seen tons of videos on how to use it but when i tried it it turned out to be hard work... i tried like 4 or 5 times on each nail, first it would not stamp the desing then it only half of it, I almost gave up but being a stubborn person I kept trying. Half of the desings did not work,specially the solid french one. I would recomend only because after all the hard work my nails looked really nice!</li>
    <li> /this product is almost impossible to use..I have did my own french nails for a very long time..this is a waste of time and money...would not purchase again or recommend</li>
    <li> This kit is perfect. It gives you everything you need to start nail stamping on your own. I own this kit and a large set of Shany plates, and I have to make this observation known: the Konad plates are larger and give lots of room for paint, while the Shany plates have smaller designs. So if you have a larger nail surface, Konad plates might serve you better if you are looking to stamp things like french manicure tips or whole nail designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with a correction pen (haven&#x27;t tried this out yet), 2 bottles of stamping polish (black and white-awesome stamping polish!), a stamper, a scraper, and 3 awesome plates. Perfect for your french manicure, and a little variation for those of you who like to add a little flair to their designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to have so much fun with this. It takes practice, but it is worth it! I recommend this for anyone who loves doing their own nails!</li>
    <li> I am new to the stamping world.  I have a set of bundle monster stamps and these are the first Konad plates and polish I used.  I must say there is a difference between the bundle monsters and these. I have had more success with the Konad plates. I don&#x27;t know why, but they seem to stamp better.</li>
    <li> My introduction into nail stamping. I ordered this kit as a starter for me.  I got 3 plates, 2 stamping polishes along with the clean-up stick.  I have tried it, it works and I am happy with the product.  Everytime I try doing french tips by hand they would always turn out sloppy.  Now they&#x27;re perfect.  There is a learning curve but once learned your good to go and its fast.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and fun.  I get lots of compliments when I do my nails and other people&#x27;s nails.  With the price of getting a professional french manicure you can purchase this little set and use it over and over and over again. And you Save, save, save! :)</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It comes with everything you need. It comes with three plates which is nice so you can chose from several different designs. I am new to the stamping world and I thought they were very easy to use. It takes a little bit of practice but the end result is so worth it. It looks like a professional french manicure. I am able to use my regular nail polish and have no problems with it. It shipped quickly and arrived on the first delivery estimated date. Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a great looking french manicure. I have always wanted to be able to do my own french manicure but was never able to get it right and I am so happy I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;I usually do two or three coats to really make the color pop.&lt;br /&gt;Work fast because the polish dries quickly (this is great because there is virtually no wait time while waiting for your nails to dry)</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but it takes time to get the hang of getting the French manicure on straight. Be prepared to spend a little time getting used to using the stencil (it works better if you wipe it and the stamper with acetone first). Good luck. Its a great product and here at Amazon, it was a good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very cool nail product, but need a little practice before you can really know how to use it. But overall, I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this set!  It is so much fun to create different looks for your nails.  It comes with two polishes-black and white and 3 french tip stamping trays.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t always stamp a whole design on your nail, when it does they are awesome. I&#x27;m still practicing hopefully that will help</li>
    <li> This simply doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at all the high reviews on here makes me wonder if I got a bum batch of polish because multiple attempts have failed:  My stamper will NOT lift polish from the disk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone online and tried various \\&quot;problem solving\\&quot; techniques suggested by the Konad site and other users, but no such luck...  Doesn&#x27;t matter how fast I move.  Doesn&#x27;t matter if I use acetone-based polish remover to clean the disk/stamper.  Doesn&#x27;t matter how much--or little--pressure I use when trying to lift from the plate.  Doesn&#x27;t matter how much I knead the removed stamper surface.  Doesn&#x27;t matter if I&#x27;ve tried to \\&quot;scuff&#x27; the stamper surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Booooo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will contact the seller about returning this.  :o(</li>
    <li> So i just get into nail stamping world alright and be amazed by all the magic what we can do with these stamper, so i had done some research google, youtube and amazon i searched for the best deal to start and found this set. Somehow my order arrived so fast for $18 you got 3 Konad plates, 1 scraper, 1 stamper, 1 black special konad polish, 1 white special konad polish, 1 french tip pen corrector and lucky me the seller gave me 2 Konad holiday plates but both plates were the same design but well its extra, so plus for me. Because other seller sell this plate for $5 and i got all for $18 it&#x27;s a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered bundle monster 2012 25 pieces plates too, it came pretty much at the same time with Konad kit so i could try the plates from both brand. I&#x27;m so new and it really didn&#x27;t go well at first try, the Konad plates are awesome the polish are the best, so after i&#x27;m done with konad plates i turned to bundle monster plates and tried a lil bit. It just didn&#x27;t work very well, the BIG PROBLEM was the stamper didn&#x27;t pick up at all, even i tried many time..so i gave up and did more homework on google..&lt;br /&gt;So what i found out if any of you have same problem, the stamper didn&#x27;t pick up the color of the nail polish please try to take it out and massage it, yes i found this video on youtube this girl (sorry forgot the name)had same problem and she remove the stamper rubber and massage like you know make it loose a lil bit, people left a comment said it work so i gave it a try and it work like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some said use a nail buffer on it like slightly buff on a nail file,i almost got there somehow this video save me or i might end up ruin my stamper, so just give it a try what you got to lose right remember Massage your stamper!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And other thing is use a pure Acetone, first time i used this Sally Hanson Acetone + Vitamin E or something once i cleaned my stamper with it, it will not pick up the color from the plate that well like using a pure acetone. so beware of your nail remover too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so after problem solved I am enjoying doing my nail, explore the new designs and rally have fun for the first time, my french manicure didn&#x27;t look super sloppy like before..( still need a lot of practicing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok where we at now so if you hesitate what starter kit will you buy, thrust me buy this one, it&#x27;s the best deal among the other sets. For $18 you get all what you need to enter nail stamping world, i was looking at Konad website they sell this set about $30 or something. Better deal here at Amazon so go for it!!!!</li>
    <li> seller was on time and product arrived in good condition. Product is awful. polish is thin not thick doesn&#x27;t make a good stamp. Most of the stamps don&#x27;t work either. I can&#x27;t recommend this and I don&#x27;t want to spend the money to return it. really unhappy with the product.</li>
    <li> We love this kit, very complete, exctly what it shows on the descrpition, I do recommened it. It comes with a pen with nail polish remover so if you messed up your nail and got a little bit of nail polish outside nail this will be very helful.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my friend&#x27;s teenage daughter. She has been having a blast with all of the different designs.</li>
    <li> I first saw this while on vacation in Vegas- They wanted close to $50.00 for the same set. It was tough to walk away then, but Im glad I did and paid much less here! Its a lot of fun, and if you have the patience, it works great! I get too frustrated with it to use it too often, but if you can sit it out and practice, It would be just fine. This kit has everything you need to get started. I have layered the colors and patterns and it looks fab or you can do a classic french. Oh, and the corrector pen is great to have even for when youre using regular polish! Lord knows Im CONSTANTLY painting more than I should!</li>
    <li> Great product, takes a couple tries to get the hang of it. Works very well! I was happy with the polish, but you can use other kinds as long as your quick about it.</li>
    <li> I was concerned by the misspelling on the box, but it appeared to be misspelled on every box and I didn&#x27;t notice any other &amp;#34;counterfeit&amp;#34; signs that these kits normally have.  It seems to work just fine and I have great luck with it.</li>
