      <li>Okay, let&#x27;s be honest now....</li>
      <li>I am stocking up on the Repair Sealed Ends with old packaging - it&#x27;s the best.</li>
      <li>I guess she discovered these at salon, but the Amazon price is by far the best deal</li>

      <li>Love, love, love this product!  </li>
      <li>i am for sure going to buy more LOVE IT !</li>
      <li>I paid a lot more for it at the salon, so I was happy to find it on Amazon at such a good price.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s ok, but not a miracle cure that&#x27;d for sure.</li>
      <li>and OMG I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>looks so much better.  </li>
      <li>but the smell is great and it really helps combing the hair.</li>
      <li>It does not leave a residue or make hair oily like many leave in conditioners.</li>
      <li>The tips of my hair are much better.</li>
      <li>I regret buying it, there&#x27;s nothing better for split ends than a haircut.</li>
      <li>Maybe the wash-out conditioner would be better, but given the price of this line I&#x27;m reluctant to try it.</li>
      <li>I found out about this product through a hairdresser - makeup artist in L.A., who does the hair of many celebrities.</li>
      <li>Not the authentic one you would buy from some salon and Ulta, well the USA ones.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully, in time, my hair will be healthy again.</li>
      <li>This product works hair magic.</li>
      <li>I love it and will continue to use it.</li>

      <li>The Original Curl Definer 2 oz]] is my favorite).  </li>
      <li>It works great and keeps my hair from becoming a total disaster.  </li>
      <li>I use it after I wash my hair on the parts that feel \\&quot;off\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use much at all for your hair to begin feeling softer, silkier:) Even with bleached hair!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I buy these for my mom. She swears by them. Who am I to disagree? Says her hair is salon type soft/nice after application. I guess she discovered these at salon, but the Amazon price is by far the best deal</li>
    <li> I am an older woman with long hair that I color a lot, and use a blow dryer on daily.  So I use the Sealed Ends every day, and it protects my ends from splitting and drying up.  It works great and keeps my hair from becoming a total disaster.  I am never without it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 3 years now and the most recent ones I purchased from Amazon must be a new version of the product bc it is in a new tube and it has a strong smell/fragance.  I personally do not care for the fragrance as it smells like a man&#x27;s musk cologne.  I still use it though bc I like what it does to my hair.  The price on Amazon was great.  It&#x27;s much more expensive in the salons or at Ulta.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!  It definitely protects against split-ends and helps already split-ends look better.  Using this product also extends the time between haircuts because of that attribute.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a few weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of improvement. Sometimes it seems to work well for the day, but mostly it only makes my hair look and feel greasy, even if it&#x27;s only been a few hours since I&#x27;ve washed my hair. Perhaps my hopes were too high after reading the other reviews, but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used to carry this product until she changed salons.  Just a little bit smooths frizzy, dry, static-filled hair.  It has a pleasing smell and lasts a long time.  I wish I could find it locally!</li>
    <li> Bonacure&#x27;s Sealed Ends leave in conditioner is a product that I hope will be available in the hair products market always.  What the entire Repair Rescue and Moisture Kick lines do for your hair is unbelieveable.  I am a black woman with chemically relaxed hair.  When the products are used on my hair, wet or dry, I can immediately feel the moisture and softness immersed into the strands of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, my daughter&#x27;s hair benefits tremendously from this product.  We began using the product line as a referral from a sytlist.  It was recommended as a response to my daughter&#x27;s EXTREMELY dry hair.  I kept her hair in braids due to swimming and her EXTREMELY tender scalp--could not afford to comb it daily due to the discomfort to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would notice a lot of shedding as I took her hair down and her ends were so dry and splitting.  I started using the Bonacure lines of Moisture Kick spray[[ASIN:B000O5WGHG Schwarzkopf Bonacure Moisture Kick 6.8oz]], Repair Rescue Shampoo[[ASIN:B000YHSZ2E Schwarzkopf Bonacure Repair Rescue Shampoo and Conditioner Liter Duo Set (33.8 Oz)]], conditioner, and Sealed Ends [[ASIN:B000ULRDJU Schwarzkopf - Bonacure Repair Sealed Ends - 2.5 oz.]]with occassional treatments with the Repair Rescue Intensive Repair Conditioner[[ASIN:B000M4PPRM Schwarzkopf BC Bonacure Repair Rescue Treatment 6.8 oz]].  Our daily treatments involved the Moisture Kick applied to her braids and worked into it hair following up with the Sealed Ends (2-3 times/week).  After the Moisture Kick, we would apply a moisturizer (Carol&#x27;s Daughter Hair Milk[[ASIN:B003IILPIC Carol&#x27;s Daughter Hair Milk The Original Curl Definer 2 oz]] is my favorite).  The first time that I took her hair down after being on the Bonacure regime, I was amazed--the shedding was almost non-existent.  I would say it was greater than a 50-60% reduction in the amount of hair lost by the time all of the braids were down.  I HAVE BEEN A FAN EVER SINCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair&#x27;s health is so evident when I don&#x27;t have the product for a period of time.  Buying substitutions is no longer an option.  I tell all my friends and even strangers about this product. It is not easy to find local representatives to carry it--even in Atlanta!  I was willing to drive to get it.  I now look for the best deals but getting it is not an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and you will be delighted.

    <li> My ends are pretty damaged from coloring.  A little of this smoothed onto the ends and any flyaways and my hair looks so much better.  It feels very nice, not sticky and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all like some others I&#x27;ve used- and it smells great too.  A great product, glad I found it!</li>
    <li> i heavy highlight my hair with bleach every 4 weeks. this leave in really makes a difference.i have tried tons of hair products,its hard to find a  conditioner or leave in that really stands out. this one does!</li>
    <li> Usually I am awful about buying &amp; trying new hair products to help my damaged hair. (Or, should I say, healthy hair!? :) ) This product is so light, most creams make my hair really heavy &amp; greasy! This product also lasts a while. I no longer am searching for a good repairing cream, this is the only one I need! My split ends used to be awful, now I don&#x27;t have that many! It even kept my hair nice after I dyed my hair white.</li>
    <li> I started using this product at the recommendation of my hair stylist. I have very fine hair with a lot of split ends and a lot of breakage. I really notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use it because my hair is much more knotty and gets tangled more easily. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge reduction in split ends, but it makes my hair so much smoother. I paid a lot more for it at the salon, so I was happy to find it on Amazon at such a good price. I bought two of them! I noticed that it smelled a little bit different than my last bottle, but it seems to be working just the same.</li>
    <li> I have very fine long hair.  I can&#x27;t use a normal conditioner because it weighs it down too much.  This stuff is awesome and keeps the ends from breaking while still making it easy to comb through when wet.</li>
    <li> Good product, smell good. The tips of my hair are much better. I went to the salon and I asked the girl about my dryness of hair. And she said that it wasn&#x27;t dry at all. So I am happy.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. Nice product to put in prior to drying/styling. My hair is somewhat freezy and color damaged.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using it for years. It leaves your hair soft and silky protecting your hair from the blow dryer and flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have plain jane boring straight hair. It&#x27;s extremely thick and heavy and it really doesn&#x27;t do much. BUT I LOVE this stuff on my hair... it makes it slippery and sleek and shiny and it feels like a million bucks when I use it. I ONLY use this stuff when I wear my hair straight... otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t take a curl. Great stuff though!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF SMELLS LIKE ANGEL BREATH. Oh my goodness, not only does this stuff dramatically soften the ends of my very dry and split-end-full hair, but it is literally the best thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled. I&#x27;m considering emailing the company and requesting that they make a perfume of this fragrance - it&#x27;s that good. I just wanna bathe in it.   But seriously, my hair is very prone to split ends and I&#x27;m constantly battling dryness. However, the first time  I used this stuff at night (on damp hair), I woke up in the morning to luxuriously soft hair. My ends seem to be significantly less split and I even rub some of the cream through my whole hair to get all over smoothness.  Great stuff, smells GLORIOUS.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, light ash brown naturally that is very resistant to blonding under the wrong hands. I moved, and had to try a new colorist and she overprocessed my ends so badly they were stretchy!! Found a much better hairstylist and am slowly growing out the damage. I am not willing to cut my hair short, so I have been trying a multitude of products to make my poor dry ends look healthy and soft. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried has been terribly effective.  I STRONGLY, highly recommend this product to anyone with overprocessed ends. I&#x27;m sure it would work great on other hair types too.</li>
    <li> My hair is soo soft when I use this! Just started using it after a recent hair cut so I&#x27;ll have to report back later about if it helps with split ends. Incredibly soft hair though.</li>
    <li> Throw away all those other conditioners and buy this!! I have bleached hair that is naturally curly and,when wet, cannot be combed UNTIL I use this product.  I have tried &#x27;everything&#x27; on the market and this does the job every time.  Especially great for keeping away those frizzy ends...perfect for that damp ocean breeze.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my stylist used on my hair and I LOVE it! I have very coarse, dry hair and this product has completely transformed it to smooth and silky! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily or weight it down like most shine serums/sprays do. I highly recommened this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff works excellent!!  It makes my hair so soft and tries to heal my split ends.  It does everything as promised and its not too greasy!  I will definitley be buying this stuff again when I run out.  And did i mention that it lasts forever?</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!! I usually have so many split ends, even after a trim, but this always makes my hair feel like I just left the salon. Bought 2 of them and will buy more!!</li>
    <li> This product works hair magic. After so many coloring my hair was very damage, so damage I couldnt even style it just a pony tail but now I can style it how ever I want...it has volume &amp; texture, is back at life!!!!</li>
    <li> This product came in an Amazon box but was then encased in a black plastic bag that said \\&quot;part of a set,do not separate\\&quot;  So they are obviously selling broken sets, so this has to be a gray market item.  When I opened the bag the product had leaked out all over the inside - probably lost about 1/4 of the stuff.  Overall, displeased with this seller.</li>
    <li> When I received this I really didn&#x27;t think such a tiny product would be good for my thin-medium thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;But I was wrong! This is really great stuff! I use it after I wash my hair on the parts that feel \\&quot;off\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use much at all for your hair to begin feeling softer, silkier:) Even with bleached hair! So I&#x27;d def recommend this to anyone who has fried hair and doesn&#x27;t want to cut if all off.:P Just remember, a lil bit goes a long way!:)</li>
    <li> While the claim is only a change in packaging, there is a definitely a change in the product itself. If you buy this product, make sure it&#x27;s the WHITE tube with the light blue banner.  They changed the packaging to a RED banner...it&#x27;s NOT the same &amp; very disappointing.  I am stocking up on the Repair Sealed Ends with old packaging - it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> It really works like magic, except the perfume is a little strong.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received was a bit used though, so the 4 stars</li>
    <li> I actually haven&#x27;t use this product. I always forget to apply it. I regret buying it, there&#x27;s nothing better for split ends than a haircut.</li>
    <li> The product I recieved seems to be a bogus conterfit.  I have used Bonacure Repair for over 4 years, purchased from various sources at beauty supply stores and online including other Amazon sellers.  The product I recieved here is not the same texture, scent or look of what I have been using.  This stuff is clear and greasy, not white and creamy.  The real stuff conditions my hair and makes it easier to comb.  This stuff I recieved leaves my hair greasy and knotty.  The containers seem to look like the real thing, but the contents are not even similar to the product that I have been using.</li>
    <li> my hair stylist used this on me, ever since then i fell in love with it! no more split ends and repairs it!!! ahh!! love it!!</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff off years. Ily thing that word to keep my frizzy hair under control. Love love it !</li>
    <li> It seemed a little dis colored and the smell was not what I remembered.</li>
    <li> Great product to protect the ends of your hair from heat damage. I use on the bottom few inches of my hair before blow drying.</li>
    <li> I received the tube with light blue striping. It was packaged as saying, &amp;#34;Part of a set - not for individual sale&amp;#34;. Upon arrival, the tube itself was defective and a seam was open. Product was everywhere, a complete mess. Thankfully, Amazon refunded me for the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try what was left of the product and I was sorely disappointed. The product is sticky and I have a cheap Dove brand sealer/smoother that works wonders tenfold against this stuff. It does help with frizzy and split ends, but not as well as other products. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have never returned anything on Amazon - but this went back. I have been using Sealed Ends for more than 5 years now and the product itself is fantastic. I don&#x27;t regularly get haircuts and my stylist is always surprised that I don&#x27;t have more split ends. I attribute it to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this was a supplier I had never used and I was SO disappointed. The bottles arrived in little black plastic bags that looked cheap and dirty. I could feel the contents had come out inside the bag, but I opened it anyway because I thought maybe the cap lifted - not the case. There were holes in the sealed top of the tube, which was where all of the product was seeping out of. The bottle was clearly half empty as well. The smell IS NOT the same as the true Bonacure Sealed Ends, and the product was extremely sticky. I would be very cautious about ordering from this seller - this product is not the real deal, nor is it a good knock off.</li>
    <li> Bought this solely based on all of the other reviewers. Other products for me have worked better, and were less expensive, and more lightweight on my hair. Still have 1/4 of the bottle left and when it arrived the bottle was at 3/4 full and advertised as new. I am not going to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Everyone and anyone can use this product. Ive been using it since i was a teenager and now im in my mid 20s, and its STILL the best thing ive ever used. I have medium thick hair and very long, and it keeps it healthy and shiny and NEVER greasy. Its so healthy and long i get asked if i have extensions! I love it because my sister has thinner short hair, and it does miracles for her. My friend who is of african and european decent even loves this stuff! Absolute miracle product!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for many years.  It does not leave a residue or make hair oily like many leave in conditioners.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this product works yet - I just put in my hair now. I used the reddish packaging before which smells great, but this one - I just can not stand the smell. Like a bad deodorant with sweat. Not going to send it back but I am not happy. Ordered the other one by the same company different packaging and good smell...</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 10 years and love it.  My hair is naturally curly and tangles up so easily.  Just a small amount of this stuff right after my shower and the brush go&#x27;s right through my hair.  After its dry it is so soft to touch. This is not a styling gel! I use it in my sons hair who is 1/2 Black and it makes all the difference in his curl (no frizz)  I have also used it in my nieces straight hair to get out tangles and it works there too and she now uses it every day too.  I never want to run out of this or I panic.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I highlight my hair and was it was getting damaged and this has really helped.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product for hair.  I have tried a lot of salon brands to keep split ends at bay (including, but not limited to: Aveda, Redken, Pureology, Paul Mitchell, Bed Head) but NOTHING works as well as this.  I have a ton of fine, straight hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl, so really, drying and flatironing are my go-to styling tricks.  Split ends seem to really show on straight hair, so I get really frustrated when it&#x27;s only been 8 weeks between haircuts and I look like I haven&#x27;t cut my hair in a year.  This prevents that problem and I find I can use whatever shampoo/conditioner I want and still get awesome results with this.</li>
    <li> Family is very pleased with results!  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Not the authentic one you would buy from some salon and Ulta, well the USA ones.  I think this is Mexico product, it doesn&#x27;t have the some result or smells the same.  It&#x27;s really oily.  I ended up returning this item.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and you only need a small amount!  I have thin, fine hair and it gives me volume and shine like no other product.  I feel like I just left the salon every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product through a hairdresser - makeup artist in L.A., who does the hair of many celebrities. You can use it on wet hair or dry hair.  It really smooths out the look of my hair and takes away the frizzy ends.</li>
    <li> It smells funky at first but goes away after a few minutes. Works great though! My hair feels softer and healthier since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years...it lasts forever and you truly can see a difference in your split ends within a few uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years.  It only takes a little dab and your hair combs out without any breaking/snapping. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> i really like this product. about a year ago i re-visted a hair salon i used to go to and the owner/stylist gave me several samples of products from this line.  i used this one because at the time i had the ends of my hair dry and damaged.  i decided to go online and search for it and was pretty excited to have found the shampoo, conditioner and repair sealed ends products.</li>
    <li> I have swore by this product for years. I have friends who now swear by it as well. This product, once you use it, You will never again live with out it. I have extremely long hair and refuse to cut it, even a trim. I haven&#x27;t cut it for about three years. No split ends. :) Buy it, You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Not at all like the red bottle even though it said it was! The red bottle is a cream this is more like serum. When I got it the seal was broke and it had leaked all over the other things it shipped with. Not happy at all with this product</li>
    <li> My hair was dry and frizzy one of our patients told me about this product and OMG I LOVE IT I CAN FINALLY WEAR MY HAIR DOWN without hairspray or gel my hair is back to the way i use to have it. i am for sure going to buy more LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> I loved THIS version of this product. The current version (red label) is not as good. The aroma is bad, the texture is poor and the outcome is not as good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually &amp;#34;repaired&amp;#34; my split ends, but it did seem to temporarily seal them and I love the weightlessness of this stuff. My hair is thin, so heavy products do me absolutely no good. I would recommend this for damaged, thin hair.</li>
    <li> This product is so good that I am writing my first product review ever.  It makes your hair soft and smooth while not weighing hair down.  I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is working or not...I kind of wish I didn&#x27;t buy it.  Moroccan oil is the best thug for ends, I wanted to try this and it&#x27;s ok, but not a miracle cure that&#x27;d for sure.</li>
    <li> Super easy &amp; fast delivery</li>
    <li> This product is NOT what I ordered.. I&#x27;ve previously used and the formula is not what it&#x27;s supposed to be.. Color, smell, texture, all bad! Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Excellent, Item was delivered on time</li>
    <li> I always use Schwarzkopf products.  This is another great product from their line.  I use it before I blow dry and it minimizes damage and seals those frizzy little ends that you sometimes get.</li>
    <li> Product does what is says.  Great product, although different from salon version.  Smoothes out frizzy fried hair after styling.  Makes ends stronger and Appear thicker.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to try this product because it arrived damaged and had spilled all over the inside of the packaging it was in. I dont think that the damagehappened during shipment, but rather left the warehouse in that condition because the outside packing envelope was in perfect shape. The inner packaging looked like it had been sitting around for a while and also said that the item was to be sold as a set and not as an individual piece. I wish I had read the other reviews that recommended avoiding this selling, they are totally illegitimate. Thankfully I got a refund but I would not risk buying from them again.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, and thinner as the years go by, but has always tangled if you even breathed on it.&lt;br /&gt; Over the years I have tried so many different products, and as they get discontinued  I have to find something new that works-especially at detangling, and not being so heavy it leaves a residue.  This has worked the best for me for a number of years-I also use it after diving/snorkeling when my hair looks like a rats nest-it combs out rather easily, and you only need a little dab of it</li>
    <li> I have bleach blonde hair that has a lot of damage and split ends. I finally stopped dyeing my hair to try to get it back to a healthier state. I apply a dime size amount in my damp hair and it instantly detangles. My hair feels better after blow drying, however, after a few weeks of use, I have not noticed any significant repair to my hair. I still have split ends and breakage, but this product does seem to revitalize my dry hair so I will keep using it. Some people have complained about the smell, but I actually like it. Hopefully, in time, my hair will be healthy again.</li>
    <li> Huge differance in the way my hair feels an tames frizzys recommended it to my daughter her hair. is very full an puffy</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would help smooth my hair and my split ends. It did neither. It&#x27;s alright as a general moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t do much more. &amp;#34;Meh&amp;#34; sums it up, imo.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells nice.</li>
    <li> I am hispanic and the texture of my hair has always been thick and wavy and it doesn&#x27;t help that I have always kept it long (down passed my bra strap).I have also been in the southern part of Afghanistan which is the dryest part of of the country, not to mention the dryest place I have ever been in the world. This place has made my hair so dry and frizzy that I was afraid I was going to have to cut at leat 3 inches when I returned to the states next month. After using this product, I genuinly see a complete transformation in the texture of my hair. I am very pleased with this product and would recomment it to anyone trying to repair their hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product to tame those winter fly-aways. I&#x27;ve been using it every day since it arrived-</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time and love it.&lt;br /&gt;However, since Schwarzkopf changed their packaging, the product seems different.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product in the packaging shown, but the new packaging that has red on it, I do not like as much.</li>
    <li> after a year using it my ends are still splited, no sealed att all;  but the smell is great and it really helps combing the hair. lasts forever.</li>
    <li> My sister told me about this product and highly recommend it to everyone.  You only need a little bit and it makes hair silky, smooth and takes away the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is both colored and highlighted, so to say it is damaged is an understatement.  This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years but never ordered it from this seller.  It is obvious this product has been diluted in some fashion in that it usually is so smooth that after an application you cant hold onto anything - however from this seller the product is sticky after application to the hair, my hands are sticky afterwards and the product smells very different. Would not recommend purchasing it from this supplier - LATEST BEAUTY</li>
    <li> This product is the only one that works on my daughter&#x27;s hair and makes it easy to brush and to look perfect. I keep buying it on regular basis.</li>
    <li> use this everyday..it is awesome!</li>
    <li> I just have been using it for 3 days so I really can&#x27;t talk about the results. but I definitely feel how smooth my hair gets after I apply it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product (obviously to buy it at the salon is practically double the price).  I have long hair, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my ends dont get as \\&quot;fried\\&quot; between haircuts (every 3 - 4 months).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years with great satisfaction. However, because now I live in a region where it is not readily available in beauty stores, I must turn to Amazon. The product from this supplier is NOT the product I have been using for years. While normally white and creamy in texture, this product is yellowish, grainy and runny. Buyer beware!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely could not go without this product! I have very thick wavy hair and its dry as well. Sealed ends immediately makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  I was introduced to it years ago when I was trying to grow my hair very long.  I was trying to avoid hair cuts but my hair was frizzing out and becoming unmanageable.  With this product, I am able to add it to my unruly ends and tame my hair, especially in-between hair cuts, as I am trying to grow my hair out again.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;My Name is Anna, and I have a bleaching problem.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;High-Lift is my middle name, 001 Extra Light Ash Blonde is my shade.&lt;br /&gt;I dye all my hair everytime I dye, to refresh the ash and cut down on the orange/yellow tinge that comes with being an natural brunette who dyes their hair blonde. The ends of my hair are the definition of overprocessed, with about 2 years of high lift blonde colorings in their history, they were constantly breaking off like snowflakes, and brushing my hair while it was wet was a joke, for fear of my hair simply giving up and all coming out in the brush, because the ends of my hair were literally frayed, creating a mess of tangles. My hair grows extremely slow though, and cutting out the damage was an absolutle last resort, because of the amount of hair that would be taken off, and I literally feared a buzz-cut was in my future. Don&#x27;t laugh, I actually considered it!&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;I saw it on Amazon and read some reviews, but couldn&#x27;t decide if it was worth a try or not, so I waited. So stupid. Then I recieved an Ulta giftcard for my birthday and figured I&#x27;d spoil myself and attempt to resurrect my hair, or my only other option was cutting off the last 6-8 inches of terribly damaged hair. I paid $21 dollars for it at Ulta, but after a single use I realized I would have easily paid 3X that, because it was a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;My strawlike scarecrow hair had that softness you see only in shampoo commercials, all flowy and smelled terrific, and I was addicted. I cannot go a day without it, after towel drying your hair after a shower, use a nickel sized amount and work it into your ends and then use any excess from your hands on the rest of your hair. I buy another bottle when I&#x27;m only halfway through one, simply out of fear of it being out of stock when I run out. Finding it on Amazon at this price was one of the best moments of my life, being completely serious! It doesnt matter if you have even the slightest bitof damage or hair so damaged you are wondering how you would look with a buzz-cut, this product is a hair essential. It gives you shampoo commercial hair! You will not be sorry!&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this until the day I die, and I want to be buried with a few hundred bottles just in case Amazon doesn&#x27;t ship to heaven! haha</li>
    <li> Best conditioner and I can&#x27;t live without it.  If you have over processed hair and style it daily, this make a huge difference and saves your hair!</li>
    <li> nice, cheap and fast shipment</li>
    <li> Great working product! It seals and prevents split ends ALL DAY. My hair is thin, so when it&#x27;s humid I get extremely flyaway ends. It says to use it on wet or dry hair, but I mostly use it as a finishing product. This is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Okay, let&#x27;s be honest now....nothing cures dead split ends or glues them back together again...Dead is Dead. You gotta get out the scissors every couple of months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However...this is still really good stuff otherwise. A tiny bit goes a l-o-n-g way ( size of a green pea ) which makes my hair soft and tangle free just by running my fingers through it (when right out of the shower). My hair is color treated, dark brown over 90% gray and is middle of my back long. The color seems to hold better and it feels very nice and conditioned all day.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t ask for better....well I could but miracles aren&#x27;t for sale.  Will be buying some more of BC&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;Kat~</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, good seller.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but found that the only thing it did for my very long, thin hair was to make it feel like there was product in it. No additional softness, shine or improvement for my split ends. I will not purchase this product again. The tube I received had a red stripe, not the blue.</li>
    <li> I feel that this has the protein building blocks that my hair needs to build its straight as well as keeping it silky smooth. Most other products just give you the temporary smooth fix without adding the health to the hair that it really needs. I seem to always go back to needing this product.</li>
    <li> I only received 2 of 3 items! Other then that,&lt;br /&gt;it is a good hair product! I would buy more!</li>
    <li> I expected some visible difference based on all the reviews, but after using the product maybe 10-12 times I see zilch improvement in the texture of my hair. If anything, it&#x27;s a tad shinier, but it stays a little sticky and smells pretty strongly of product. The scent isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s impossible to get away from. And my ends look no less split. Maybe the wash-out conditioner would be better, but given the price of this line I&#x27;m reluctant to try it. Good luck to you all :/</li>
</ol>
