<li> Am so sorry I couldn&#x27;t find something wrong in this product .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very happy with the product but it took forever to get here from China!</li>
    <li> Even thought this is for a man, 3 of my female friends already wanted to take it away from me. They love it. It certainly looks great on me.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon and the entire team for doing such a good job on delivering the products quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent but it has no zipper</li>
    <li> Style is perfect, large enough to fit iPad and speaker a long with other essentials.</li>
    <li> was a birthday gift and the recipient was thrilled</li>
    <li> Well am taking my time to share my bag experience because it&#x27;s amazing product, the style or look is very good ,great . The material is leather . It&#x27;s very easy to wear that and simple (in side have got 3 pockets,  one with zipper and 2 without zipper . Outside with one pocket that you can close every single time with main or frontal leather ). For me the product is fashion and if you want to buy that , buy now . You don&#x27;t will spend you money for nothing and you will win more than seller. Don&#x27;t worry about the price , you will forget in shortly time . Just trust me the product is fantastic, great, amazing, fashion, durable and perfect. Am so sorry I couldn&#x27;t find something wrong in this product . Buy it now and you never repent to spend your money and time . Well is that so for me, thanks bye bye.  (Trust , believe in me , I don&#x27;t have nothing to win, we are sharing our experience and we hope are helpful for you).  N.T</li>
    <li> Very nice quality . I was surprised for the price. Now if I can just get my husband to throw away the old one!</li>
    <li> Amazing. I needed a small, fashionable bag that allowed me to carry my DSLR and a few personal items in case I wanted to go out with friends or to an event.  Usually when that happens, there is always that one friend who wants to go out to the club or to a party after, so I wanted to have a bag that allowed me to carry my stuff in those environments without being bulky. It got to me FAST. People are always impressed when they see this bag.</li>
    <li> As Described Great Quality</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my Father and it is really nice quality and for the price  I paid it is worth!</li>
    <li> Fantastic cheap man-bag. If you aren&#x27;t afraid to have your sexuality or American pride challenged, then indulge in this cherry murse (man-purse). At $20, you won&#x27;t be getting a top quality bag, but, you&#x27;re not going to care. It looks classy, it&#x27;s extremely functional, and adequately durable. I&#x27;ve had mine over a year and it&#x27;s definitely looking worn, but the other bag I was looking at was $150. I could buy 6.5 of these for that much, and I can&#x27;t imagine any one bag would last as long as six of these. I&#x27;ll probably buy another one when a zipper finally fails, but so far the only wear is a little cracking of the vinyl around the zippers. Oh yeah, it&#x27;s not all leather; just a flap of leather that composes the facade of the bag. Still, a freakin&#x27; bargain of a man bag. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the logo on the front (I Sharpied over it), and the logo woven into the strap. Yet, I ain&#x27;t dockin&#x27; a full star b/c that would be jacked up. This is an adequate and attractive bag at an extremely reasonable price. If you&#x27;re heterosexual and this is your first murse, brace yourself for a little flack. Also, it helps if you can put something extremely manly in it to deter from the femininity associated with a purse. I keep a flask of whiskey and two packs of Magnum condoms in mine even though I certainly have no need for those things. Cheers to great, cheap bag :)</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok but I expect the inside bucket will be bigger then the actual size</li>
    <li> Beauty, stylish, comfortable and quality bag!</li>
    <li> Shipping wasn&#x27;t the fastest, but it was free. First impression was, smell that leather flap. The seams are good and the zipper seems strong. Lining is adequate, will need to see how it lasts. More than enough room for my phone, tablet, and wallet etc. The strap is comfortable and adjusted easily. Color is very consistent between real and faux leather. For the price, absolutely worth it and more.</li>
    <li> Having to use a wheelchair to get around , this bag allows me to carry around I need when out and about. I can have my required medications and personal items at hand when needed. In addition to being functional , it also looks good .</li>
    <li> Too small for an iPad</li>
    <li> Outstanding product!  I get compliments about it everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> This was a present.  I thought it may be a bit small, but he loved it and says it&#x27;s perfect for his needs.</li>
    <li> At first i loved this bag. It was useful and it looked good. But after only a month it was falling apart. The lining had ripped away in both compartments, the zipper on the back had come off, and the seams are coming undone. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> It is small though and not much room (smaller than I initially thought when I ordered it). I&#x27;m using it as a smaller, nicer looking diaper bag for my daughter. Holds about 3-diapers, a thin wipe pack, a change of clothes and couple odds and ends. Works great!</li>
    <li> Good bag for small items such as iPod, phones, pens, wallet etc</li>
    <li> Nice bag, doesn&#x27;t meet my needs. Doesn&#x27;t hold my tablet and some other pertinent items I like to have handy. Should make a nice gift though.</li>
    <li> handy neat keeps items organized and protected from loosing and damage. so far holding up well although it has not been that long.</li>
    <li> Excellent price,  fast shipping,  amazing messenger bag</li>
    <li> Black Kangaroo Medium Bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above is the description and dimensions of the Kangaroo bag at the time I purchased it in July 14.&lt;br /&gt; It is the perfect size for the 7&amp;#34; Dell Venue in its case or any 7&amp;#34; tablet.  An iPad Mini fits in place of a 7&amp;#34; tablet.  Anything bigger needs a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides holding the tablet I also fit:&lt;br /&gt;  2.1 Bluetooth Speaker&lt;br /&gt;  Aluminum Folding Tablet Stand&lt;br /&gt;  AC 5v Dell USB Charger&lt;br /&gt;  8400 Mah Backup Battery Pack&lt;br /&gt;  Micro USB cable&lt;br /&gt;  Mini USB cable&lt;br /&gt; Eye Glasses with case&lt;br /&gt; Stylus Pen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not carrying a battery pack &amp; glasses, a wallet and Smartphone would fit also.&lt;br /&gt;8&amp;#34; or larger tablets needs to go up one size to a LARGE Kangaroo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover flap is real leather, has magnets to secure, but the rest is fake leather, It all matches well with the look of quality.  There are Kangaroo logos on zipper pulls, cover flap, nylon strap as well as a leather logo tab within.  For this price I think it is incredible.  I have had mine for 4 months now, use it daily and it is holding up very well.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this, the shipping was not free, but it arrived in 3 days, so it did not come from China or Hong Kong.&lt;br /&gt;I preferred spending $5 more for shipping rather than wait 15-30 days from HK.</li>
