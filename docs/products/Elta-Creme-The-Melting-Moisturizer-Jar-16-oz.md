<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> People rave about this and it seems to work well enough but it is very greasy and stays that way for quite a while. They used it in the hospital where my dad was at after a fall which is how we found out about it. To me It is basically Vaseline and wax in a jar.</li>
    <li> Had 33 radiation treatment &amp; this lotion is so soothing.  Not greasy like some of the creams. Very good feeling.</li>
    <li> Best ingridient combination. It really helps in rash, very fast. And skin feels good on a daily use...</li>
    <li> This jar was a lot bigger than I expected but I LOVE this crème!!  It melts on to my face and hands so I don&#x27;t need as much.  I have very dry skin and this feels WONDERFUL!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product...truly the melting moisturizer.  After my elderly mother&#x27;s peripheral artery disease did a number on her foot...she had procedure and foot is in recovery. In the mean time the physicians office suggested applying this moisturizer to her feet daily...which were extremely dry...at one point she had a big dry protruding scab, for lack of a better word on her big toe... One day while applying the moisturizer...felt the skin move...off it came...revealing new skin underneath. Now when I moisturize her feet I do my own...Couldn&#x27;t find at our local pharmacies and was happy to find it on Amazon.  Highly recommend...</li>
    <li> I found out about this product at my Dr&#x27;s office while I was being treated at a wound center.  This product glides on fast and easy and really holds the moisture in the skin.  Only a little dab is required and it keeps the skin moist and soft without being greasy.  Even though I do not need the product medically, I still use it because it works so well on my very dry skin.  I just love it!!</li>
    <li> This creme is great. I have a skin disease that leaves my skin very dry. This was recommended by a Dermatoligist for my Lupus skin rash.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 93 yr. old mother.  This is the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever seen!  It touches the skin and melts and believe me a little goes a long way. Keeps the skin moist all day. It&#x27;s probably a little more expensive than say any of the big name cremes and lotion but, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I use Elta Cream on my feet and it work great to keep my feet being dry and cracking. I would think anyone with dry hands or feet would like this cream.</li>
    <li> I put it on with my skin wet as directed.  It stop my winter leg itching by 80%.  This was my second Pound jar the first one lasted over 2 years.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickley and the product works for my Mom&#x27;s arms.</li>
    <li> works well but is a little greasey a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need much of this. Will last long time. Had to get used to oilyness.</li>
    <li> This is very good creme. It&#x27;s not greasy and it goes right in the skin. I have been using it for quite a few years now and I can&#x27;t do without it. It&#x27;s good for very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for someone other than myself who is undergoing radiation treatment for breast cancer.  Even her doctor was impressed with the results --</li>
    <li> This stuff is greasy.  You need to know that.  It does get absorbed fairly quickly though.  My mother-in-law got some of this during a hospital stay. Made such a difference, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Great during the dry winter.</li>
    <li> I suffer from really dry skin and was always trying different products.  I was not aware of Elta till it was recommended to me by the doctor that removed my big toe.  Each week he could see the skin getting more dry under the bandage and also up my upper leg, since they both had to be wrapped.  He recommended that I try Elta and had it available for sale at the clinic.  Since then I have recommended it to several of my friends who suffer from cracked fingertips.  It has healed them within days.  I would highly suggest if anyone suffers from any dry skin condition to give it a try.    Thanks So Much \\&quot;Elta\\&quot; !</li>
    <li> it is so soft!! absorbs very fast, feels great of sunburned skin, fantastic for ultra dry skin. Neutral Smell, clear color&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, going to wound care 2 times each week. Eliminated problem with dry, flakey skin. Don&#x27;t be stingy with it. No more dry flakey skin after three applications.</li>
    <li> Both our babies have sensitive skin and need lots of moisture, but they don&#x27;t like to sit still while we rub other creams in.  This was recommended by our allergist.  It spreads like warm butter and is not greasy.  Even my husband who generally hates to rub lotions on the babies uses this with no complaints.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have very sensitive skin on my face, and with daily use this crème leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I am diabetic and have used Elta for several years. Last October I fell and broke my left ankle In 3 places and broke my right foot In 2. After a couple Months I stared Therapy and my legs and feet were so dry. The first time I went for Therapy she had to sweep up the dry skin. I can say after a couple weeks using Elta every day that my feet are soft as a baby&#x27;s. I hope I never have to be without It! Thanks Joyce</li>
    <li> Great Quality.  Makes Great Gift for special friends.  This can&#x27;t be purchased just everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and I wouldn&#x27;t change&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> This is truly one of the best products to use if you have skin issues. It does melt into your body. I recommend this product highly! Your skin looks amazing after using this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like putting water on the area in need.  The heat of your body instantly starts it melting and transitions it to something like baby oil.  Can get a little messy but will definitely bring the moisture.  Have a towel alongside.  It works best if you use it right after taking a shower as it traps the water moister and combines it with it&#x27;s own.  When used on hands, it survived several washings which I am not accustomed to with my dry skin.</li>
    <li> The dermatologist suggested this as a reasonably priced excellent moisturizer.  He was right!  This stuff is great.  Don&#x27;t be put off by the greasy feel when you first apply it.  It absorbs in quickly and leaves your skin feeling as good as the pricier moisturizers.  I bought the tub for home and the tube for travel.  If you have dry skin, you can&#x27;t beat this for excellent, affordable moisturizing that lasts.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve bought this product for family and friends, I find it so good.  My friend was going through chemo and her hands and feet were really dry and cut, this was the only product she liked.  Put it on at night with socks and wake up the next day feeling much better.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my doctor to keep graft area moist, works really great!</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised! I love this creme. I&#x27;ve filled little containers and shared with family and friends. This is my second jar.</li>
    <li> Very greasy but softens callouses on my feet.</li>
    <li> This is not the regular Elta cream that comes in the smaller container. This is very thin and liquid and actually pours out of the container if you don&#x27;t hold it upright. It does not moisturize your skin as well as the regular cream.</li>
    <li> Very economical. Nurse at foot care used it so i ordered some. Very soothing! i would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It helps keep my scar tissue down.  Received the product very fast.  Thank you very much</li>
    <li> some of the products better than others but I liked them all.some of the products better than others but I liked them all.</li>
    <li> I am a nurse I use this product in the clinic for pt. with dry skin. It helps the skin stay moisturized without being greasy. i recommend it to my clients as well as using it on myself. I also use it on my husbands feet he has diabetes . This help keep the skin on his feet from becoming cracked and cause sores as a result of the cracking. This is a inexpensive product that goes above an beyond the call of duty.  Elta is a skin and wound care product that is worth it weight in improving the texture of the skin , with out the greasy feeling!</li>
    <li> Used it this winter. Due to frequent hand washing at work, my hands crack and bleed in the winter. This is the first cream I have found to prevent that. And believe the jar-a little does go a long way. You only need a small amount each use.</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry skin, particularly for people with diabetes.  Melts and though incredibly pure... it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
    <li> I use this for cleansing and moisturizing, careful not to use to much, it really does melt! good for heels w/socks at bed</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Completely healed my cracked heels!  Amazing!  It&#x27;s greasy so you have to wear socks to bed, but it only took three days!</li>
    <li> Very Rapid Delivery! Applied To Chapped and Dried Hands / Feet  / Face Results Exceeded Expectations in 24 Hours - eliminated 80-90 %&lt;br /&gt;Soreness and Inflammation Leaving Tissues Soft and Pliable..Quite easy to Apply...The BEST moisturizer that i have ever Used !&lt;br /&gt;Unquestionably ELTA Creme is a 5 Star product. Recommended. Would purchase again ....A Bargain at Twice the Price.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on the skin, and I little goes such a long ways.  I will definitely be purchasing this again.  Loving it</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for keeping lower legs dry to assist in leg ulcer care.</li>
    <li> I am a wound ostomy nurse and I suggest this product MANY times- REALLY works on dry skin! Great for diabetic skin or any dry skin condition!</li>
    <li> It takes a long time for the skin to absorb the product, hence the skin stays greasy... similar to Vaseline.</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  We used when my sister was very ill.  Now we&#x27;re using it on my brother who is very ill with very dry skin. Thank you for such a superior product.</li>
    <li> I thought it was lotion and it was like pure grease. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I was told by my husband&#x27;s Wound Nurses that Elta Creme would be the best thing to keep his aging, dry skin soft. I sent for it @ elta on Amazon, got it right away and have been using it on him (and me). I believe it is doing a great job! It is not a cream lotion but a solid with an oily surface which I was not used to but it works great. Instructions say dampen the skin area being worked on first to better absorb the Creme.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you elta for a great product and Amazon for it&#x27;s terrific products and great shipping.</li>
    <li> My mother in law started me using this and it is the only moisturizer that she will use.  So at least I know what to get her for birthdays and Christmas ;&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a little more out something this expensive. What you get is a huge jar of lightweight vaseline. It is totally greasy and even though they say to go lightly with it it won&#x27;t last as well as a good lotion will if you don&#x27;t put it a pretty good coat of it.</li>
    <li> When I first got this creme at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed. Then I actually read the directions, and my whole viewpoint shifted. I get out of the shower and leave most of myself wet. While still wet, I apply a small amount (doesn&#x27;t take much!) of this creme (more like vaseline) on my wet parts, and within 10 minutes it&#x27;s soaked in and I&#x27;m really moisturized. During the day I keep it by my sink (along with a little container of olive oil for my fingertips) and don&#x27;t dry my hands much before using the creme. Again, it&#x27;s awesome. Just remember: Water and Little Bit (and probably the 10 minutes before grease turns into smooth and supple). I love it.</li>
    <li> The main reasons I am giving this a 3 star rating (for now) is because 1) I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough or regularly enough yet, and 2) because I am still in shock over the size of this container. I mean, it&#x27;s really really big, and way too bulky for me to carry around as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had ordered the smaller tube instead. You can only use a &amp;#34;smidge&amp;#34; of this product at a time (because it will be too greasy if you use more than that) which is good for making the cream last longer for sure, but there&#x27;s no way I will ever finish off this container, like EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS greasy at first, but if you wait a couple of minutes, the greasiness goes away, and that is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I am typing, I just thought of buying a small plastic container to cart around with me, and that should solve one of my problems with the size of the container.  This actually might even solve my second problem with it, and that is being more consistent with the application of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now I&#x27;m going to change my rating to a 4 star and let you know how it works once I get my smaller containers, and use frequently. I hope this works out for me.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me when I had radiation therapy for cancer. It was the only thing that relieved the burning and stinging sensation that happens well into treatment. Lidocaine gel was useless. I also recommended Elta to a friend undergoing treatment (chemo, radiation) for a different kind of cancer, and he found it very helpful as well. A little goes a long way. I was told if you can still see it on your skin 2 minutes after appilcation, you have used too much!</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended. Best value at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this moisturizer. Excellent product and easy purchase. Elta works wonders for dry skin. Use sparingly. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I am a nurse and discovered Elta cream when a friend was in the burn unit and that&#x27;s what they used routinely. It&#x27;s a great product, works best when applied after showering or bathing, The containers last a long time as a little goes a long way. I find I may change shower gel, soap, lotion etc.... But elta is a constant.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a cream anywhere than can do what this Elta does for us.  We even use it as a lip balm.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s perfect to use in the winter in cold climates. Keeps the skin hydrated. Love it.</li>
    <li> Actually purchased for my mother and she doesn&#x27;t stop talking about how much she likes it so it must be good.</li>
    <li> Everything went as expected.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have difficulty with extreme dry skin, and this creme is a good balm when my skin is irritated. The jar is quite large. You really get good value for your money. My only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long on my skin as I&#x27;d like, but while it&#x27;s with me, it&#x27;s soothing.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!  Great product!  My dad had a foot injury and they were using this stuff on his feet to keep them soft while they healed.  I use this on my sons dry legs and it works a wonder. He hasn&#x27;t had an ezema flare up since we started using this product 8 months ago.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for extra dry skin.  And, you only have to use a little to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this because we use it commonly in the hospital on large surface burn scars  and excessive dry skin. Two of my kiddos suffer from eczema/dry skin combo. This stuff is great! You will be a little greasy, but totally worth the moisturizing power. My oldest legs could easily be compared to snake skin (when not using mass amounts of topical steroids). Not any more!</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for the last year and has performed well and would recommend this to anyone with dry and cracked skinn</li>
    <li> This cream melts into your skin and stays put for 24 hours. It&#x27;s my very fave</li>
    <li> Love this product.  3 ingredients and works great</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING ELTA CREME ON MY LEGS SECONDARY TO EXCESSIVE DRYNESS AND SCALING OF MY SKIN. IT WORKS VERY WELL AND DOES NOT LEAVE A RESIDUE ON MY WHITE DIABETIC SOCKS. THE ONE POUND JAR HAS LASTED OVER A YEAR AND I USE THE CREAM SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK.</li>
    <li> We use this creme on a bedridden patient for very dry skin and it brings great relief.</li>
    <li> elta is a very good creme for healing.</li>
    <li> This is the best creme for very dry skin that I have ever used. My doctor advised me to try it and the results have been excellent.</li>
    <li> Product is amazing! A Nurse recommend it for my husband and the whole family uses it. I used it on a burn and daughter used on a cat scratch. Both healed fast!</li>
    <li> Great product for the winter month.  Use it daily.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old has a bad case of &amp;#34;Papi I&#x27;m so ITCHY!!!&amp;#34;.  So our dermatologist strongly recommended this cream or creme.  I was hesitant in the beginning as we&#x27;ve tried all the other cremes, only for them to not be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was desperate to stop the itchies...and so purchased, with hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since purchasing, my 10 yr old has gone from &amp;#34;Papi I&#x27;m so ITCHY!!!&amp;#34; 3x&#x27;s a day to maybe, maybe 1x in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products for dry skin.  I have finally found a product that resolves the problem.</li>
    <li> I purchase the Elta for my father who used it alot.  I got a good price on line at Amazon and he was very happy. No complaints from him. I purchase it many times.</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff--a bit pricey but well worth it</li>
    <li> I have poor circulation to my legs, which makes them dry and the skin prone to breaking and sores forming.  My vascular surgeon, who dresses these wounds that don&#x27;t want to heal, got me started usng Elta, and I am amazed at the difference it makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first tube of Elta, I was very pleased with it, but wondered if it might be just because I was faithful to apply it daily. So, to &#x27;save&#x27; money, I tried other lotions - Cocoa Butter Deep Moisturizing Conditioner, Lubriderm Intense Skin Repar, and Jergen&#x27;s Extra Healing Lotion for extra dry skin.  They just don&#x27;t measure up.  Their therapeutic effects are short term at best, and at worst some are sticky and unpleasantly thick. And all of them, even when applied 2 or 3 times a day, have only a topical, temporary effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately after using Elta, my skin is stronger and softer, definitely visibly healthier.  Applied just once a day (after a hot shower is best), and using only a small amount (it&#x27;s all you need it glides on so silkily) it&#x27;s softening, smoothing lasts all day.  Reapply a lttle in the evening for even more impact!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pound jar will last for months so it actually works out to be the best way to buy it.  Since I won&#x27;t be trying any more substitutes, why buy the smaller quantity?</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Really moisturizes the skin without clogging your poors.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever.  In fact, plastic surgeon who fixed a place (from Mohs Surgery for a little&lt;br /&gt;Basel Cell) wanted to know what I used on my non wrinkled 81 year old skin.  I told him&lt;br /&gt;about elta, and the next time I went in for a check up he had a whole display of the elta MD...&lt;br /&gt;same stuff but in silver packaging!</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, this is cheap and awesome.  Sort of greasy but really works.  Use it every  night and you will see results -- but only if you have older or dry skin.  Use it at least an hour before you go to bed because it needs to &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Absorbes well. Good for someone with severly damaged skin.great bargin in the one pound jar.</li>
    <li> I recommend this highly, especially if you have problems with dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer ever, and this is the most economical way to buy it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 15 years,  It was recommended to me originally by the dermatologist.  Not a sunscreen....you need to add that to your routine.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by a friend. It is a wonderful cream, that takes a very small amount. It is excellent for dry,cracked heels and is a wonderful moisturizer for your skin. and melts \\&quot;on contact\\&quot;. It makes my legs smooth and a little shine also. The only problem people would have with this is by using too much at a time. A great moisturizer for your hands and cuticles during the winter also.</li>
    <li> I have bad lymphadema in my legs and my skin tends to dry out faster than most people so for a long time I was hunting like mad for a product that would keep my skin moist and not flake up  and here it is, this stuff is the real deal and you dont have to use to much of it and it lasts a lot longer than most other lotions or moisterizers do</li>
    <li> Prompt and courteous service, amazing results Elta is magical you really notice a difference in the moisture of your skin in days literally.</li>
    <li> My two daughters inherited my sensitive skin, and this is the best protective ointment I have found so far.  We go through an amazing amount of this stuff.  Good for Exzema, keratitic dermatitis, and atopy.</li>
    <li> I bought this 16 oz jar of Elta moisturizer through Amazon. com for my husband as a recommendation as a wonderful product from the nurse in the Emergency Room at our local hospital. He had scabs from his leg being so dried out as a result of his diabetes to the point it would drain a nasty fluid. He applied this moisturizer morning and again at night and in a very short time, all the nasty scabs and drainage were gone, as well as the redness in his leg.  Well worth the cost and effort he says.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is perfect for overnight wear.  Put it on hands, elbows, wherever your problem area is, and wake up smooth and soft.  It&#x27;s a little greasy for me, so I don&#x27;t use it during the day, but it works wonders on my winter dry skin.  My friend has dry facial skin, and swears it is perfect for that.</li>
    <li> Bought because I had read so many great reviews on this, however it is quite &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; and DOES NOT ADD MOISTURE. I would describe it more as a barrier to keep moisture in/out. My sky is naturally very dry; after this soaks in my skin doesn&#x27;t look healthier or more moist. I think Vaseline would do about the same job. Same consistency and texture as Vaseline.</li>
    <li> I really like this product !!!!</li>
    <li> Was given this cream while in Vanderbuilt Hospital. I have extremely dry skin and this product is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with product</li>
    <li> My diabetic parents had dry skin that would develop cracks despite using popular creams. This was recommended by a nurse who works in Wound Care and it mosturized their skin so quickly they have had beautifully soft skin since.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!  A little pricey but worth it! It&#x27;s a large jar so it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizing lotion for feet!</li>
    <li> This Swiss product works wonders for my sons ezcema.  To us, the price is worth the fantastic results.  We are glad we found Elta.</li>
    <li> My Home Health Care Nurse from Hammond Henry Hospital in Geneseo, IL, recommended that I order the Elta Creme.  She had used some samples on my legs, and the Elta Creme is just what I needed to clear the dryness.  The nurse said she orders Elta Creme for her mother through Amazon.</li>
    <li> very nice cream, especially while in radiation treatments.  Use just a small amount, it&#x27;s waterproof and soothing.  Like it, too bad it&#x27;s hard to find, but Amazon had it.</li>
    <li> I have erd degree burns and it is very helpful in reducing itching and tightness</li>
    <li> You can use this sparingly and still get great results. I use to massage my surgery scars and moisturize them.</li>
    <li> I have some dry, cracked skin on my feet and knees.  I was looking for a good moisturizing cream and when I read the reviews I thought I would like this. I did not realize its first two ingredients are petroleum and parafin. I prefer using something like jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and purchased it from a store in Dallas.  They no longer carry the product and I knew of no other source until I found your site.  I LOVE this product because it does not stain, can be tailored with various essential oils for specific client needs and because of its excellent &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; when using it on a client.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a one pound jar of the moisturizer before for my leg that had Sepsis in it eight years ago!</li>
    <li> i use the creme whenever I will not be in the sun as it has no sunscreen. I don&#x27;t use it when wet, I use it dry. I also pat some around my eyes before I go to sleep and it makes me look more well rested in the morning. Packaging was good and delivery timely. It will probably take me a year or more to use up the entire jar.</li>
    <li> I had very rough skin on my legs due to an infection 4 years ago and my Dr. recommended I  try this. After 1 week there was such a noticeable  difference I&lt;br /&gt;was amazed. Takes a very small amount and also good for  hands and any dry&lt;br /&gt;skin.</li>
    <li> Most lotions tell you to apply generously.  Not this one.  It tells you to apply sparingly because a little goes a long way.  And it is right.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, but it seems to be really helping my dry skin.  It&#x27;s also nice to know that Elta products generally have some of the EWG&#x27;s highest ratings for safety.  [...]</li>
    <li> Now that I am a Senior Citizen I find that my skin is very dry.  I use Elta after I pat off from getting out of the shower.  I then use Elta to help hold the moisture in.  Remember it only takes a little.</li>
    <li> I have cellulitis and require using cream daily and compression socks.  This Elta cream is what they used in the rehab hospital.  It is great stuff!!  But pricey.  This was a blessing finding this product for this price.  Large 1 lb. jar.  Usually they sell it in little 5 oz tubes for almost the same price.  Will be ordering extras.</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft now that I have been using this product. You only need a tiny bit! It simply \\&quot;melts\\&quot; into your skin just as promised.</li>
    <li> Well priced, delivered timely.  Absolutely terrific product.  Melts at body temp, so it&#x27;s easy to apply with little or no waste.  Large tub lasts about a year for 2 of us in semi-arid Colorado.</li>
    <li> this works very well - does not break out my very sensitive skin - ordered on line because sometimes not able to purchase locally and this was an unbelievable price for this size</li>
    <li> Recommended by my son&#x27;s pain management doctor for his dry skin.  She also suggested we buy on Amazon to get the best price. The whole family uses it; one of the best purchases we have ever made.</li>
    <li> Bought for my dad love it and arrived before due date</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s bad on me as I was not expecting it to be so oily and greasy.  Perhaps I&#x27;m not the intended user for this product, but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product</li>
    <li> a bit too thick and &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; for me.  It makes my skin &amp;#34;roll off&amp;#34; too.  This may be a good thing, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work. My wife has no more dry patches and dermititis is clearing up well. Found it here cheaper than local drug stores.</li>
    <li> Recommended for my elderly mother by a Doctor seems to be very good.  This should last a very long time!</li>
    <li> My Dr recommended it.  It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It has helped the wounds on my hand immensely &amp; the scars are shrinking every day! The creme was recommended to me by a wound care specialist. The amazon site had the cheapest price. i would rate the Elta creme exellent!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this as a treatment for dry feet.  After a shower, you put this on and let it sit for a couple of minutes while it melts into your skin.  It leaves your skin feeling softer for several hours.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer, and I have tried everything!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. It is amazing and I will continue it and recommend it for anyone with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product because it was recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;I works great to dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great in the shower!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for moisturizing very dry skin.  Price seems a bit high but product performs well.</li>
    <li> Great for moisturizing arms and legs - especially for an elderly person (88) - I have tried many and this is the best!</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended by my doctor for continuing dryness on my legs due to circulation problems.  It is light, no order, ad  seems to melt into the skin leaving a nice shiny glow.  A small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product absorbs relatively quickly no scent and will not stain clothing. Keeps skin moisturized and soft for 12 hours or more</li>
    <li> Great product. My wife says it&#x27;s the BEST skin moisturizer!</li>
    <li> It really smothes the skin. Very Prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> Love this - I slather it on my face, neck, arms, legs and feet before bed and it keeps my skin quite soft and is much more affordable than other fancy creams and lotions.</li>
    <li> This product is buttery, as previous reviewers said. It goes on easily, a definite plus. However, for my extremely dry, sensitive skin,  I have to combine elta with a body cream such as Cetaphil or AmLactin for lasting relief. Even then, I have to re-apply daily. Considering all of this &amp; the price of elta, I will keep searching for the best dry skin product. It works best on damp skin.</li>
    <li> My order arrived with one lid broken on a container.  This was due to no packing material to separate the 2 containers during shipping.  When I called The Medicine Shoppe contact number, at first they were uncertain whether they would be able to replace the lid.  I was very disappointed about that.  However, later that day or the next, a lady called our home and spoke with my husband.  He said she was very personable and told him that they were shipping a new container.  I was extremely happy at that news and at the desire they demonstrated to have a satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 4 Star rating has nothing to do with the service but the product itself is not as long lasting as I had hoped it would be.  Other than that aspect, I am pleased with the product and extremely pleased with The Medicine Shoppe&#x27;s service.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mother who is 92.  It was recommended by a friend.  She uses it on her feet mostly for neuropathy.  I use it on my feet for dry and cracked heels.&lt;br /&gt;It is very helpful and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this product and how it last for 12 hours. I use it as a moisturizer, just a little mind you, before applying my makeup. Love the dewy texture. I have really dry skin so great for me. Great on legs in summer.</li>
