      <li>I got 12 packs for a great price.  </li>
      <li>So I was happy to find that I could purchase Sunstar GUM replacement rubber tips, thirty-six for $11.24.</li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>happy with buying these from amazon.com.</li>
      <li>The item I received is absolutely perfect and easy to use on my teeth.</li>
      <li>Good value, arrived on time, product is as described.</li>
      <li>The order arrived as promised from the seller in good condition.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve changed my rating because I FOUND A PERFECT SOLUTION for the problems I originally described below.&lt;br /&gt;HERE</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>Good price and a must if you own a gum stimulator.....</li>
      <li>The stimulator refill packs are a great value, allowing the metal handle to be reused indefinitely; the tips are relatively easy to swap out.  </li>
      <li>Great product for certain and with this purchase, a great price.</li>
      <li>but I find they work best when they are new and don&#x27;t develop the curve.</li>
      <li>the price is right and the service is great.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Used to be able to get these at my pharmacy, but no longer.  </li>
      <li>I am quite pleased with this order.  </li>
      <li>What more could you ask?</li>
      <li>hee  :-)</li>
      <li>Ordered too many, need to return them</li>
      <li>Better than floss and recommended from my dentist.  </li>
      <li>These flexible rubber picks will leave your teeth feeling very clean.  </li>
      <li>This is a great way to save money instead of buying an entirely new gun stimulator.  </li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re now nylon so much more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Easy to Use 1.</li>
      <li>The tips should come off and go on easily.</li>
      <li>2 of the &#x27;EASY TO USE\\</li>
      <li>For about three days it has been working fine, with no tendency of the tip to come off the handle even when I apply strong pressure to my gums.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and MAKES A PERFECT TIGHT SEAL QUICKLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>fiddly...hard to put new tips on, and I have good dexterity.</li>
      <li>Buying a pack of 12 cards (with 3 refills in a pack) is much more economical.</li>
      <li>Place rubber tip between teeth and apply light pressure in a circular motion to massage the gums.</li>
      <li>The purchase of these refills was VERY cost effective.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a difference since using a gum stimulator and it&#x27;s important to learn how to use one optimally.</li>
      <li>the ideal would be to use both, but my choice will continue to be the rubber since it has a systemic good effect and you can always get any plaque your flossing misses removed at your next office cleaning, but if you don&#x27;t get the last it would be very smart to use both the rubber tips and the proxabrush in addition to the flossing.</li>
      <li>Be sure to soak one in hot water before trying to get it on the end of the handle.</li>
      <li>I hope you&#x27;re able to enjoy the savings as much as I have.</li>
      <li>For easy removal and installation, fill a sink with hot water.  </li>
      <li>Item arrived quickly and on time.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was quick, on time.  </li>
      <li>So far I cant find a better deal.</li>
      <li>Place the rubber tip under warm water for several minutes to soften the rubber material.</li>
      <li>Place the rubber tip under warm waterfor several minutes to soften the rubber material.</li>
      <li>These steps suggest that one should place the OLD rubber tip under warm water for several minutes so as to remove it more easily and then &#x27;moisten&#x27; the new tip and put it on the tip of the metal handle.</li>
      <li>I found brushing and flossing wasn&#x27;t enough, so I&#x27;ve been using these for a while and my gums feel healthy and clean.</li>
      <li>but ii don&#x27;t see how they would stimulate blood flow in the gums like the rubber stimulators, and the gums like any other body part are healthiest when they have a good supply of blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The one tip I have used so far is fitting much better on the holder than the last batch I bought at a store.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The old tip can be removed from the handle (Step 1) easily</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly like the Butler originals (these are Sunstar).  </li>
      <li>It makes much more sense to simply replace the tip!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such an inexpensive item that i can afford to change them more often.</li>
      <li>The product appears to work, but the instructions are misleading; the first two steps are:  1.</li>
      <li>Exactly  what I wanted and ordered.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>But, good ole&#x27; reliable Amazon not only carries them, but they&#x27;re sold at a very low price when purchased in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased this item because it was small enough to fit in my Laptop bag, price was excellent and the blue color was exact match for the cover of my laptop[</li>
      <li>Seems little doubt that the proxabrush would clean plaque better</li>
      <li>Exactly what the dentist used to give me, thanks</li>
      <li>need to be replaced once they no longer penetrate deeply between each tooth - likely every 2-4 weeks - or you lose much of the good effect of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Everything from ordering to receiving was very quick and simple.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to heat the tip with hot water prior to running along the gumline or massaging at the area between two teeth and the gumline.  </li>
      <li>It certainly works but is the easiest thing to not use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>Much nicer than the beat up one I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
      <li>They are not sharp, are a little flexible, and feel good on the gums.</li>
      <li>These smaller than original size</li>
      <li>You simply cannot get your teeth clean with just brushing and flossing alone.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Original Problem:&lt;br /&gt;There is NO way to REALLY get a new rubber tip onto an existing handle.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
      <li>which has the same kind of handle but has a little brush on it instead of the tip.  </li>
      <li>I attempted to follow the first two of the above instructions, but the tips are difficult to get on and, most importantly, keep coming off when in use and have to be reinstalled.</li>
      <li>The non-replacement tips on all the Sunstar GUM stimulators I purchased in the past never came off their metal handles, and I was able with them to apply pressure to stimulate the gums, but the replacement tips come off the metal handle whenever I apply any pressure.</li>
      <li>Twist and pull to remove old tip from handle.</li>
      <li>The tips last much longer than that</li>
      <li>I use these after flossing and my electric toothbrush, and am always amazed at how much plaque is still left for these tips to remove.  </li>
      <li>wow I guess I never looked, but I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find these.</li>
      <li>Extremely important to disrupt the stuff that gets trapped between your teeth and gums.  </li>
      <li>Place both the old stimulator and refill tip in the water and let them soak for a while.  </li>
      <li>Remove the old tip 2.</li>
      <li>Twist and pull to remove old tip from handle.</li>
      <li>Have helped me avoid gum  problems for the last 26 years, the recommended (but not always accomplished)</li>
      <li>And if you think it might be on tight enough and turn it to make sure, IT WILL FALL BACK OFF three</li>
      <li>After 2 months, I&#x27;m about to take off the first tip - so it works out to roughly a 6 year supply.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly as described. I change the tips every month since I use the gum stimulator twice a day. The tips last much longer than that but I find they work best when they are new and don&#x27;t develop the curve. It&#x27;s such an inexpensive item that i can afford to change them more often.</li>
    <li> I tried these refills &amp; most of them fail to hold during usage.  The tip keeps falling off to the point that I gave up after numerous attempts of reattaching it.  I tried other tips &amp; they all are the same.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for these refills for some time.  I recommend this pack of 36 refills (twelve packs of three tips).</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I thought there would be 12 refills tips but there were 36.  It&#x27;s a small package but the deal is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a difference since using a gum stimulator and it&#x27;s important to learn how to use one optimally. There are online videos that show how to use this product.  It certainly works but is the easiest thing to not use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;36 tips will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.  The one tip I have used so far is fitting much better on the holder than the last batch I bought at a store.  Would recommend this purchase to anyone needing this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I bought a lifetime supply.  For easy removal and installation, fill a sink with hot water.  Place both the old stimulator and refill tip in the water and let them soak for a while.  Remove them from the water with a fork or some other utensil.  The tips should come off and go on easily.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to save money instead of buying an entirely new gun stimulator.  I hope you&#x27;re able to enjoy the savings as much as I have.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the Butler originals (these are Sunstar).  12 packs of 3 tips (36 tips total).  After 2 months, I&#x27;m about to take off the first tip - so it works out to roughly a 6 year supply.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these at big chain drug stores. Works great.</li>
    <li> I find the best use for the stimulator is to remove food in-between teeth.  Arsen</li>
    <li> The item I received is absolutely perfect and easy to use on my teeth.</li>
    <li> I use my GUM stimulator every night, and these little tips last me about a month. They are not sharp, are a little flexible, and feel good on the gums. Be sure to soak one in hot water before trying to get it on the end of the handle.</li>
    <li> This is a life time supply. It is a geat bargain. What more could you ask? Delivered promptly too. You will not to buy them again.</li>
    <li> What is there to say? They do what they are supposed to do. The annoying thing, which has nothing to do with the product itself, is that you can buy the handles almost anywhere and nowhere carries the refills.  Thank you, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great value. Can&#x27;t find in stores. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t get descriptive here.  I&#x27;ll just say that if you think flossing is removing everything you need to remove before your brush, you&#x27;re wrong.  I can&#x27;t say it any simpler than that.</li>
    <li> Use the GUM stimulator regularly and could not resist this purchase, as you are getting 36 refills. Great purchase for the price. Can&#x27;t beat it if you use the stimulator daily.</li>
    <li> Only stimulators that work for me.</li>
    <li> Suppose you brush and floss religiously - that&#x27;s a good start, but you&#x27;ll be disturbed what still lingers beneath, between, &amp; behind all those little nooks and crannies on your teeth.  These flexible rubber picks will leave your teeth feeling very clean.  It&#x27;s important to heat the tip with hot water prior to running along the gumline or massaging at the area between two teeth and the gumline.  The stimulator refill packs are a great value, allowing the metal handle to be reused indefinitely; the tips are relatively easy to swap out.  Ramp up your oral hygiene routine with the GUM® Stimulator.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the dentist used to give me, thanks</li>
    <li> wow I guess I never looked, but I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find these. Much nicer than the beat up one I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
    <li> Cannot find these in the stores anymore.  Great value.  I got 12 packs for a great price.  My dentist is really big on building gum strength with these so I have enough for 2 years and I did not have to hunt for them through every store.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s been using these for many years, and it&#x27;s often difficult to find these replacement refills.  But, good ole&#x27; reliable Amazon not only carries them, but they&#x27;re sold at a very low price when purchased in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with buying these from amazon.com.</li>
    <li> great product. great price</li>
    <li> helps keep gingivitis at bay.</li>
    <li> Good value, arrived on time, product is as described.</li>
    <li> These were purchased for my Mom after her dentist wouldn&#x27;t provide them any longer and we checked Amazon and found them and she is happy since she says they work the best.</li>
    <li> The service was fantastic, but the bad press you received recently somewhat negates this.</li>
    <li> Exactly  what I wanted and ordered.  Great deal with multipacks too!</li>
    <li> Refills were a little too small and did not fit.</li>
    <li> I found brushing and flossing wasn&#x27;t enough, so I&#x27;ve been using these for a while and my gums feel healthy and clean.</li>
    <li> fiddly...hard to put new tips on, and I have good dexterity.</li>
    <li> One of the few sites where you can find these refills.  Why waste money on a new GUM stimulator when you can buy a years worth of refills for the same price?  It works.  Delivered as promised - on time and in great condition.</li>
    <li> Good price and a must if you own a gum stimulator..... you don&#x27;t want to be using the same tip after the rubber breaks down.  I just visually inspect mine and when the tip starts to bend or lose it&#x27;s shape........i just replace it with one of these refills and off i go until the next time.........i usually get at least a month out of one refill tip, depending on how &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; i am on my teeth  tee hee  :-)</li>
    <li> I received this order before I expected it.  The purchase of these refills was VERY cost effective.  I am quite pleased with this order.  Everything from ordering to receiving was very quick and simple.  I will definitely reorder from this vendor through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Product performed as advertised.</li>
    <li> My wife uses a GUM Stimulator regularly and therefore goes through these tips fairly frequently.  Some of the sellers here on Amazon sell them only in individual packs of 3, which makes the shipping rather dear.  Buying a pack of 12 cards (with 3 refills in a pack) is much more economical.</li>
    <li> Used to be able to get these at my pharmacy, but no longer.  I use these after flossing and my electric toothbrush, and am always amazed at how much plaque is still left for these tips to remove.  Time spent in dental chair during cleanings has been significantly reduced since I started using them a few years ago.</li>
    <li> Works great! So far I cant find a better deal.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended it, and it has improved my oral hygiene. I had trouble finding it in stores and this was perfect.</li>
    <li> Works for me! I see no difference with much more expensive ones that have to be purchased by packs of 3 + shipping. I saw some reviews that were saying the silicone piece wouldn&#x27;t stay on the aluminum handle. I had no problem whatsoever, maybe it is just that someone is trying to protect his juicy business!  :)</li>
    <li> Product was same as purchased in the past.  Delivery was quick, on time.  Price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> So happy I could obtain these refills in bulk. Buying them in three&#x27;s is expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using the GUM stimulator for years. However the refills have become impossible to find in any of our pharmacies. It was great to find them online. What a waste to keep replacing the gold metal applicator. It makes much more sense to simply replace the tip!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised.  Sealed refills and came as expected</li>
    <li> Ordered too many, need to return them</li>
    <li> For almost the same price as getting a new GUM Stimulator I can get the refills.  Better than floss and recommended from my dentist.  Item arrived quickly and on time.  The item was also as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for years</li>
    <li> I have been using these tips for several years, but, for whatever reason I have found them difficult to find.  Great product for certain and with this purchase, a great price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because it was small enough to fit in my Laptop bag, price was excellent and the blue color was exact match for the cover of my laptop[</li>
    <li> Now I do not have to pay $4 for each one with the handle. I can just remove the rubber tips and change it.  Excellent !!!</li>
    <li> Tried the product because I could not find replacements tips in local store and did not want to buy a complete stimulator.  The rubber replacements did not fit stimulater pick and keep falling off.</li>
    <li> These replacement picks do the job and act as gum massagers as well as tooth picks to get all the food out.</li>
    <li> These smaller than original size G.U.M. refills do not stay on the G.U.M. massager when used. Do not buy these.</li>
    <li> Tips for replaced pick. Used for years.</li>
    <li> See update below.  For years I have been purchasing and using with great satisfaction Sunstar GUM stimulators but have been disappointed because they come with one rubber tip on one thin golden metal handle, and it seemed a waste to throw away the metal handle when the rubber tip wore out after a few months, not to mention that Amazon sells a three-pack for $11.00, which adds up. So I was happy to find that I could purchase Sunstar GUM replacement rubber tips, thirty-six for $11.24. The order arrived as promised from the seller in good condition. But the manufacturer has made a defective product.  Here are the instructions on the back:  Easy to Use 1. Place the rubber tip under warm water for several minutes to soften the rubber material. Twist and pull to remove old tip from handle. 2. Moisten base of new tip and press on to handle with a twisting motion. 3. Place rubber tip between teeth and apply light pressure in a circular motion to massage the gums. Repeat from tooth to tooth.  I attempted to follow the first two of the above instructions, but the tips are difficult to get on and, most importantly, keep coming off when in use and have to be reinstalled. The non-replacement tips on all the Sunstar GUM stimulators I purchased in the past never came off their metal handles, and I was able with them to apply pressure to stimulate the gums, but the replacement tips come off the metal handle whenever I apply any pressure. So these refills are useless, and I think Sunstar should reimburse me for my expense, as I am a loyal customer: I will return to using the Sunstar GUM stimulators at three for $11.00, and I am about to write a glowing review of Sunstar&#x27;s Proxabrushes.  Update 2017 of the above 2014 review: why I upgraded from 1 to 4 stars:  Since the tip on my stimulator had worn away, I decided to give the replacements one last try. The product appears to work, but the instructions are misleading; the first two steps are:  1. Place the rubber tip under warm waterfor several minutes to soften the rubber material. Twist and pull to remove old tip from handle. 2. Moisten base of new tip and press on to handle with a twisting motion.  These steps suggest that one should place the OLD rubber tip under warm water for several minutes so as to remove it more easily and then &#x27;moisten&#x27; the new tip and put it on the tip of the metal handle. When one does this, the tip keeps falling off, as I reported in 2014.  Steps 1&amp;2 should read:  1. Remove the old tip 2. Place the NEW rubber tip under warm water for several minutes and then press its base on to the tip of the metal handle with a twisting motion.  For about three days it has been working fine, with no tendency of the tip to come off the handle even when I apply strong pressure to my gums. I&#x27;ve given only four starts because of the carelessly bad instructions.  I hope I have the same experience with the next tip. If not, I will do a further edit. It appears that the instructions omit the key piece of advice:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve changed my rating because I FOUND A PERFECT SOLUTION for the problems I originally described below.&lt;br /&gt;HERE IS THE PERFECT SOLUTION&lt;br /&gt;A 1/4\\&quot; DRIVE 5/32\\&quot; DEEP SOCKET sold here on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B009W9ZJ3S Powerbuilt® 1/4\\&quot; Drive 6 Pt. SAE Deep Well Socket 5/32\\&quot; - 648306]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need is a 1/4\\&quot; socket drive handle to:&lt;br /&gt;1. Soak the Refill Tip in hot tap water for a few minutes&lt;br /&gt;2. Place it with the point down into the 5/32\\&quot; socket opening&lt;br /&gt;3. Use the socket with a handle and JUST PRESS THE REFILL ONTO THE HANDLE TIP. It goes on easily and MAKES A PERFECT TIGHT SEAL QUICKLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Problem:&lt;br /&gt;There is NO way to REALLY get a new rubber tip onto an existing handle.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 of the &#x27;EASY TO USE\\&quot; instructions is basically a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old tip can be removed from the handle (Step 1) easily enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for Step 2, there are no fingers or tools on the planet that can hold the new rubber tip squarely and tightly enough to push it onto an existing handle. And if you think it might be on tight enough and turn it to make sure, IT WILL FALL BACK OFF three out of four tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve gotten a new tip on an existing handle well enough to use it on my gums ONLY ONCE. While on THREE OTHER TIMES, the new tip fell off either immediately or in less than 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are REALLY going to use the Gum Stimulator in other than a problem plagued mode, you&#x27;ll just have to buy the new handles with the rubber tip factory installed.</li>
    <li> After years of just buying new single gum stimulators I finally located someone that sold refill tips. Preferred Mart is a definite keep for me.</li>
    <li> the price is right and the service is great.</li>
    <li> These stimulators work as expected. They last longer than other varieties I have tried.</li>
    <li> You simply cannot get your teeth clean with just brushing and flossing alone.  You have to go around the gum line on each tooth with these little suckers!</li>
    <li> Have helped me avoid gum  problems for the last 26 years, the recommended (but not always accomplished) goal being to stimulate the gums front and back between each tooth 10 times each time you brush.  These are replacement tips for those yellow metal stimulator handles the chain drugstores sell for $4 or so, but treat their customers like dopes by hardly ever selling these tip;s, thus maximizing their profits and minimizing the likelihood that you&#x27;re gong to keep your teeth - a pox on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips need to be replaced once they no longer penetrate deeply between each tooth - likely every 2-4 weeks - or you lose much of the good effect of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that recently a periodontist acquaintance mentioned that he like the proxabrush (Sp?) which has the same kind of handle but has a little brush on it instead of the tip.  These tips used to be metal (Yuk!) but they&#x27;re now nylon so much more comfortable.  Seems little doubt that the proxabrush would clean plaque better but ii don&#x27;t see how they would stimulate blood flow in the gums like the rubber stimulators, and the gums like any other body part are healthiest when they have a good supply of blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess for any brushing fanatics out there the ideal would be to use both, but my choice will continue to be the rubber since it has a systemic good effect and you can always get any plaque your flossing misses removed at your next office cleaning, but if you don&#x27;t get the last it would be very smart to use both the rubber tips and the proxabrush in addition to the flossing.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find them in the store.  These made a big difference that my dentist could tell at the time of routine cleaning.  Extremely important to disrupt the stuff that gets trapped between your teeth and gums.  One in the car and in the living room while watching TV.  Kind of hurts for a few days and then your gums become stronger and no more blood and sensitivity.  Still brush, floss and water pick.  It all helps and save pain and money loss in the long run.</li>
