      <li>The crease is still there, but is much shallower now.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>But, a friend recommended L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Revitalift Double Lifting Cream, so I decided to give it a try.    </li>
      <li>Because it really works.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even get a single lift and my face should be easy to fix if there is a fix in a bottle.</li>
      <li>I admit that I try to be realistic in my expectations about cosmetics.</li>
      <li>and I believe there are some other products out there that charge far more than this product.  </li>
      <li>My skin has had no negative reaction, i.e., redness or rash.  </li>
      <li>To my surprise, after removing the total top, the tubes inside were empty.</li>
      <li>so I will continue with it - mainly because I do feel a difference in how soft my face feels.</li>

      <li>I am always leery of trying new face products because I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>This product is certainly inexpensive when compared to similar products on the market, and I will buy it again.</li>
      <li>I am 27 years old.  </li>
      <li>I am so surprised to find that there is no review of this product yet.</li>

<li> That being said, I was surprised to see some improvement in my saggy-baggy neck after using L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift/Double Lifting Cream for a few weeks</li>
<li> me, a poor person, it was definitely worth the money</li>
<li> I would recommend it to&lt;br /&gt;folks who have dry, or aging skin.</li>
<li> After using the cream for about two weeks, I noticed that a very deep horizontal wrinkle across the bridge of my nose was definitely less noticeable.  </li>
<li> And not just a slight improvement, either ... a BIG improvement!  </li>
<li> Is it the applicator which is at fault--or is there actually less of the red gel?</li>
<li> I flew to another state with it carefully packed in my carry-on.</li>
<li> I especially resent this particular wrinkle because it makes me look perpetually angry.  </li>
<li> But I was at the store the other day</li>
<li> /&gt;Maybe my face is too old and horrible and I&#x27;m expecting miracles!  :)</li>
<li> Needless to say I was very upset.</li>
<li> I tried to unclog it with no success.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll report back later if it fails me for some reason ...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what the issue was and also not sure if I&#x27;ll continue to pay $12 or so for so little actual \\&quot;product.\\</li>
<li> Once you approach the 50 margin like me, every little bit helps.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have any money to waste and thought I was giving myself a little treat.</li>
<li> Already see results after just a few days.</li>
<li> So don&#x27;t get confused and think you will get double the amount of lift.</li>
<li> This product is no better then your average moisturizing cream.</li>
<li> so I proceeded to look in the mirror and instead of looking tired and sad, I looked well-rested and my skin was MUCH</li>
<li> Or at least I used to.  </li>
<li> I had thought that I might get at least a month out of one container.</li>
<li> : I have saggy, sad skin.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m highly skeptical of claims made by skin care companies, so when I saw that this product often creates almost instantaneous results, I didn&#x27;t believe them.  </li>

<li> It is unlikely that any cream or gel can reverse all those years outdoors without sunscreen.  </li>
<li> The worst of all was that about a week later, the gel tube got stuck and nothing came out of it</li>
<li> I was so frustrated I just threw it out.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed of this product.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m highly skeptical of claims made by skin care companies, so when I saw that this product often creates almost instantaneous results, I didn&#x27;t believe them.  Not at all.  But I was at the store the other day and they had a great coupon special, so I decided to give it a try.  My 50+ year old neck is the part of me where my age really shows, so I slathered it on my saggy and deeply wrinkled \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; neck. And you know what?  Within 20 minutes I could see an improvement! And not just a slight improvement, either ... a BIG improvement!  I think it took ten years off my neck instantly.  I&#x27;m truly amazed!  It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if it continues to have the same effect as I use it over a period of time.  I&#x27;ll report back later if it fails me for some reason ... but for now, five very happy and very surprised stars for this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I am always leery of trying new face products because I have extremely sensitive skin.  But, a friend recommended L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Revitalift Double Lifting Cream, so I decided to give it a try.    Good news:  My skin has had no negative reaction, i.e., redness or rash.  In fact, the moisturizer does a great job of keeping the skin smooth.    Even better news:  After using the cream for about two weeks, I noticed that a very deep horizontal wrinkle across the bridge of my nose was definitely less noticeable.  I especially resent this particular wrinkle because it makes me look perpetually angry.  The crease is still there, but is much shallower now.  \\&quot;Smile\\&quot; wrinkles around my mouth which were very deep are also shallower.  The skin all over my face feels plumper.    This product is certainly inexpensive when compared to similar products on the market, and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff and Walmart keeps running out of it,the other stores cost too much and I was lucky to find it on line for such a low price.</li>
    <li> Was I duped into this because the plastic surgeon on The Dr. Oz Show claimed it was so fantastic, it would put him out of business? Perhaps, but I was out of moisturizer and this was on sale, so I succumbed. I admit that I try to be realistic in my expectations about cosmetics. It is unlikely that any cream or gel can reverse all those years outdoors without sunscreen.  I (reluctantly)  accept the fact that nothing--even plastic surgery--will make me look 20, or even 50. That being said, I was surprised to see some improvement in my saggy-baggy neck after using L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift/Double Lifting Cream for a few weeks (yes, that was \\&quot;weeks,\\&quot; not \\&quot;minutes\\&quot; or \\&quot;instantly\\&quot; as promoted by that esteemed surgeon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now the downside:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in the photos, the applicator top is a pump which has two openings--one for a red gel and the other for the white cream. However, after two weeks of use, the red gel was gone...only the white cream came out.  Since I liked the product, I bought another bottle and AGAIN, two weeks later, no gel, just cream. Is it the applicator which is at fault--or is there actually less of the red gel? I&#x27;m not sure what the issue was and also not sure if I&#x27;ll continue to pay $12 or so for so little actual \\&quot;product.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t see anyone else has had this issue, so perhaps I just got two defective bottles.</li>
    <li> It is just another cream.  Nothing special about it.  Does not do what it claims.  It just has two creams in one.  Good scent.</li>
    <li> It is a total waste of money, I have used this product according to the directions and have seen nothing, absolutely NOTHING different, what a crock.</li>
    <li> This product actually works. I have seen a difference in my own fine lines. And I saw a Dr. Oz show after I had already tried the product. Dr. Oz was saying that the reason for the separate containers is that the two components require different PH and would not be compatible in a singular container. I&#x27;m convinced! Good price too on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is no better then your average moisturizing cream. It&#x27;s called double lifting cream because it has 2 kinds of lotions coming out 2 holes in the container. So don&#x27;t get confused and think you will get double the amount of lift. I didn&#x27;t even get a single lift and my face should be easy to fix if there is a fix in a bottle. Needless to say I was very upset. I don&#x27;t have any money to waste and thought I was giving myself a little treat. Oh well, it smells good. Take my advice buy perfume for smell. This gives you NO lift and NO tighting of the skin!  cathy</li>
    <li> This product has a nice feel and the texture of my skin has improved. Wrinkle lines look lighter. Repeated use of the product has made my skin glow.</li>
    <li> I feel this stuff works, I do notice fine lines fading under my eyes. But I&#x27;m having same problem of other have had, the white lotion keeps coming out, but the red gel stopped, by accident I broke the red lid off, so now I just take the red lid off and use a q-tip and it gets into the red gel, there is still a lot in there, so if yours has stopped working, break the top red lid off, just pull real hard, but be careful you don&#x27;t want the stuff flying out of the tube!! That happened to me. Just twist the lid as your pulling, I just put my q-tip in each to get both on the end of the q-tip and put it on my face then rub it in with my fingers. Anyone out there know of different wrinkle creams that work well too? I don&#x27;t want to deal with this lid issue, plus this was my first time I ever bought wrinkle cream, I&#x27;m 46, not getting younger!! Lol. Saw some fine lines and want to keep them FINE LINE!! Lol. Thanks!!!.</li>
    <li> Best product for the price out there for dark circles and lifting eye lids. Works in about 7 days and I&#x27;ve love this for years. great price too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed of this product. The product has two tubes. One is a gel and one is a cream. When you squeeze to get the stuff out to put on your face, both tubes supposed to work evenly so eventually you will have the same amount of cream and the same amount of gel on your finger. You&#x27;re supposed to rub the two together and apply it to your face. It supposed to give your face a little face lift, but it doesn&#x27;t really lift anything. I used it every morning and it gave my face a shine I didn&#x27;t like. The worst of all was that about a week later, the gel tube got stuck and nothing came out of it so I ended up with just applying the cream. I bought two of those products and it happened to both of them. Sometimes I would just get crumbs of gel out. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Save your money for plastic surgery.</li>
    <li> I am so surprised to find that there is no review of this product yet. Because it really works. I tried all kinds of products. Once you approach the 50 margin like me, every little bit helps. Most products are pointless.&lt;br /&gt;However, I would not want to be without this Double Lifting Cream. I notice a big difference when I run out of it. You need to use it continuously, or you have a 3 weeks building up time again to tighten the skin. I noticed a big difference especially around the jawline. But as soon as you discontinue, the effect goes away. For the price of this product you really can&#x27;t go wrong giving it a try. [[ASIN:B0047T7N6O MAKE THE COUGAR PURR]]</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  For the money, it is a good investment in my skin...I would recommend it to&lt;br /&gt;folks who have dry, or aging skin. It adds moisture and feels good on your skin..not greasy, or sticky.</li>
    <li> Delighted with this purchase.  Already see results after just a few days. Love this Revitalift line, especially the Day and Night cremes as well as the Eye cream in conjunction with this.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it.  I&#x27;m not getting any younger and this is making a big difference in my face already!  </li>
    <li> SAW IT ON TV SHOW AND TRIED IT AND IT DOES A VERY GOOD&lt;br /&gt;JOB.  NOT A MIRACLE BUT YOU WILL LOOK BETTER.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used it three times now (twice at night and one during the day), and within minutes (I am not kidding), it DID lift and it DID smooth some of the lines on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said- I am 27 years old.  Please don&#x27;t discredit me because of that: I have saggy, sad skin.  Or at least I used to.  I was online reading about actual face lifts when I came across this product.  Many people claimed it had worked instantly for them without skin irritation (I have very sensitive skin), but nothing has worked for me thus far, so I was very, very skeptical.  I expected absolutely nothing, but when I put it on, I FELT my skin plumping so I proceeded to look in the mirror and instead of looking tired and sad, I looked well-rested and my skin was MUCH smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was laughing like a maniac because it&#x27;s the craziest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier tonight I went to CVS and purchased both the night cream and the eye stuff!  I&#x27;ve left a star off my review only because it hasn&#x27;t even been three days, so really, I can&#x27;t yet claim that the product continues to work after the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, a poor person, it was definitely worth the money and I will definitely continue to purchase it, provided it keeps my skin looking like it does right now!</li>
    <li> my grocery store sells this as well so not sure I am saving much, I will need to check the costs again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it really helps my skin stay younger looking. Wish it was a bit less expensive, but still a good product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that the product actually takes away any wrinkles but it sure does make my skin feel soft.  I will still use it because I don&#x27;t see any harm in it and I believe there are some other products out there that charge far more than this product.  It may be preventing more skin sag - (I am not getting any more skin sag) so I will continue with it - mainly because I do feel a difference in how soft my face feels.</li>
    <li> First off I was able to use it once. I flew to another state with it carefully packed in my carry-on. It exploded. To my surprise, after removing the total top, the tubes inside were empty. Now can anyone explain, where did the product go? Was it ever there, or full?</li>
    <li> The gel quit working after about 10 days but the cream continued for another week or so.  I had thought that I might get at least a month out of one container. (After the first week I used it only once a day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my face is too old and horrible and I&#x27;m expecting miracles!  :)</li>
    <li> The product got clogged after 10 days. Only the white lotion came out. I tried to unclog it with no success. I was so frustrated I just threw it out. It wasn&#x27;t worth the time or postage to return it. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
