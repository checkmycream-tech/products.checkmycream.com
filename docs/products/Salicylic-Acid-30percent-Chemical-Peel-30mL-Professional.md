### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>my complaints are truly impressive!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ever experienced on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve done salicylic peels at my dermatologist office with great results.</li>
      <li>My nose has been bothering me a great deal....</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>The customer service is great though.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t experienced any peeling with it.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product!  </li>
      <li>Loving it!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll save time, money, and you can do it in the comfort of your own home!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the price, but--even more so--with the results.</li>
      <li>I achieved good frosting after just one pass.</li>
      <li>This is a good product</li>
      <li>though this seems to be a good complement (being liquid it seems to go deeper)...</li>
      <li>both have good products</li>
      <li>I want to warn you that this is very potent &amp; can burn your skin.  </li>
      <li>I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product!</li>
      <li>it peels horribly nice</li>
      <li>I found that this Peel, was more effective than what I had purchased elsewhere</li>
      <li>But glad I started with this formula for a boost and the lactic will hopefully maintain.</li>
      <li>This information, which the seller gave to me even before I purchased the product, allowed me to save $10 or more, to not having to purchase a neutralizer.     </li>
      <li>Also, the top layers of my skin don&#x27;t peel off, as I assumed they would (and even welcomed the idea).  </li>
      <li>Look up wart products, you&#x27;ll be able to verify this yourself.</li>
      <li>, i need more here, neutrilize here etc.\\&quot;, i apply it with make-up wedge sponge i got at rite aid</li>
      <li>Each required I use their neutralizer, which gave me the impression that they could charge more for the product.    </li>
      <li>This is potent stuff if you haven&#x27;t used anything like it before.</li>
      <li>any more i was sorprised to find this online</li>
      <li>A good complimentary product are the Peter Thomas Roth Max Correction Pads ( sephora.com or peterthomasroth.com).</li>
      <li>This seller is one of the most dedicated to custom care</li>
      <li>First off, Skin Laboratory is a wonderful company to work with....very quick shipment, packaged well, love the detailed instructions that come along.</li>
      <li>have significantly reduced in size and color!</li>
      <li>i also used the glycolic on my husb and he liked it very much.</li>
      <li>The application part went fine</li>
      <li>, it worked fine the firsdt month</li>
      <li>and it worked fine</li>
      <li>This peel is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I know its cheap but just go to your dermatologist to get this stuff done.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as intense as the spa grade, but it&#x27;s running a close second lol!</li>
      <li>I ws excited when I saw this product--much cheaper than the ME.</li>
      <li>Also, my skin doesn&#x27;t flake or peel -- in the past I was always trying to balance over-drying with moisturizing -- this does it perfectly!</li>
      <li>CLEAN IT (water + SOAP)  </li>
      <li>, i got them on ebay is one of the best buys i ever had i used salicylic on my 15 yr old son only t zone and cleared his acne</li>
      <li>and this WORKS!!!! Clean skin.</li>
      <li>almost gone, and my oily face is not nearly as bad as it was.</li>
      <li>I have mild acne and scarring</li>
      <li>The aspiring exfoliating I believe is not recommended for pregnant women, or people allergic to aspirins...</li>
      <li>It works very well on toning and lightly resurfacing the skin.</li>
      <li>I would use it at night since it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m amazed of how nice this product left my skin</li>
      <li>they told me to try a glycolic %50 almost tha same strengt compared to 30% salisylic i tryed it and also liked it</li>
      <li>Finally, the Free Shipping (and they pack it very well) made these purchases make even more sense for me.</li>
      <li>However, I mixed 5 drops or so with skin cream &amp; applied it to my son (only at night) &amp; he has had great results with it.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin, mild breakouts, and blackheads on my nose.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the 20% by a different company with better results.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t leave it on your face for longer than 1 minute the first time you try it.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it had been about 2 weeks after a glycolic peel.</li>
      <li>I also have received compliments on my skin after my first peel.</li>
      <li>My skin is clear, less oily and feels great.  </li>
      <li>The customer service also was very helpful.</li>
      <li>This peel has worked very well.</li>
      <li>I really dont like going</li>
      <li>Product did come fast.</li>
      <li>It really helped my stop breaking out and improved some discoloration (redness from acne and acne scars).    </li>
      <li>I tried it on my daughter straight for 2 minutes</li>
      <li>but This Peel is solving the problem and fast too.</li>
      <li>About 3 or 4 days after the application my whole face starts peeling.</li>
      <li>The instructional booklet is straight forward about the initial burning you&#x27;ll experience (you&#x27;ll have to have a hand-held fan or blow dryer with a cool setting or a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button).</li>
      <li>The new heavily marketed cosmetic lines for acne and wrinkles only contain 2% salicylic acid -- this is 30% and is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never used a product that mimicked the results of a professional peel like this!</li>
      <li>It has almost completely eliminated my breakouts, which various other prescription and over-the-counter products have not been able to do.  </li>
      <li>I pray this heals quickly, I have avoided going outside and have been housebound the last three weeks.</li>
      <li>That being said, it works well to clear up breakouts.  </li>
      <li>When I saw this product, I thought what a great way to get the same results at home, boy was I wrong.</li>
      <li>It controls my acne and Iam 57 years old.</li>
      <li>All the blackheads seem to be coming to the surface and those purple acne scars, have faded almost completely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 40 years old &amp; still break out.  </li>
      <li>I have had professional peels, but I wanted something for home use.</li>
      <li>so far.</li>
      <li>After suffering thrugh the night with the intense pain, I got up the next morning to find that my face looked like someone had thrown boiling water on me.</li>
      <li>I have tried to leave it on longer and use more often, however, bottom line, for my skin it is not strong enough.  </li>
      <li>however i would not recomend using if you have not used before i was gradually increased to 30% at my dermatologist the first time i ever tried it they used 30% and burned my face it took several smaller dosages of 20% to get rid of the burning marks on my face after a while they gave me 30% again</li>
      <li>When I removed the product however, my face was more red than usual and it burned like hell.</li>
      <li>so maybe it created a tolerance for my skin against these low-grade chemical peels because I have used this product 3 times now and the application process is very tolerable (doesn&#x27;t burn badly at all - and I&#x27;ve left it on the full 5 minutes) and the promised results are pretty much imperceivable.  </li>
      <li>This product has considerably lightened several acne scars.  </li>
      <li>But...I have fair/sensitive/freckly skin, and this barely did anything at all.</li>
      <li>I noticed a little brighter complexion but frankly, not so much.  </li>

<li> At 2% salicylic acid and a 10% glycolic acid complex, it will not only help exfoliate the dead skin (the pads have a textured side and a smooth side), but it&#x27;ll also help improve texture and tone in between treatments.</li>
<li> the product completely burned my face and made holes and black spots.</li>
<li> I have been using lemon juice on my skin as a mild exfoliant for the past few months</li>
<li> I had had similar results exfolitating with aspirins (wetting an aspirin, and then using the wet powder)...</li>
<li> Previously had 30% Salicylic Acid applied to my face by my Medical Esthetician, and thought it was terrific!</li>
<li> I will definitely try out some of their other products.</li>
<li> I have dry skin</li>
<li> , I could use it less frequently for the same results, and I can neutralize it with plain water.</li>
<li> No miracles with my dark spots or wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week.  </li>
<li> black scars all over which are obvious even with tonnes of makeup- which the dermatologist is makin a fortune off me to correct.</li>
<li> I had a peel done in my dr&#x27;s office a few years back and knew what to expect.....</li>
<li> I have struggled with problem skin and have spent $1000s of dollars on products and procedures.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After reading the various reviews, I decided to purchase this product in order to use it daily mixed in with my moisturizer at night.  It has almost completely eliminated my breakouts, which various other prescription and over-the-counter products have not been able to do.  I mix 5 drops of solution with my moisturizer at night and rub into my face.  My skin is clear, less oily and feels great.  No miracles with my dark spots or wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week.  Wear sunscreen during the day - does increase sensitivity to the sun!</li>
    <li> I mix 5 drops of this into my face lotion, rub it together in my palms, put it on all over my face every night and I haven&#x27;t had one break-out since! My forehead lines and lines around my eyes are noticeably diminished too. If I had known about this product 10 years ago, I would have saved a lot of money in cover-up make-up, acne products and overall disappointment with my skin. The new heavily marketed cosmetic lines for acne and wrinkles only contain 2% salicylic acid -- this is 30% and is AMAZING! I would use it at night since it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. It has only felt as if it was burning when I put it on before going out in the sun. Also, my skin doesn&#x27;t flake or peel -- in the past I was always trying to balance over-drying with moisturizing -- this does it perfectly! I&#x27;m so glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> This peel has worked very well. I achieved good frosting after just one pass. About 3 or 4 days after the application my whole face starts peeling. I also have received compliments on my skin after my first peel. It really helped my stop breaking out and improved some discoloration (redness from acne and acne scars).    The customer service also was very helpful.</li>
    <li> I use it once a week and my acne is clearing up - almost gone, and my oily face is not nearly as bad as it was. I missed last week&#x27;s peel and can tell I need to do it again. I followed the instructions and had little to no peeling. But, I also exfoliate every day to every other day. All the blackheads seem to be coming to the surface and those purple acne scars, have faded almost completely. The first time I used it, it had been about 2 weeks after a glycolic peel. The combination of both the salicylic and glycolic - seems to work for me...so far.</li>
    <li> Wrote the message below on another product which was meant for this one, the Salicylic Acid.....sorry!  I got confused somehow....    First off, Skin Laboratory is a wonderful company to work with....very quick shipment, packaged well, love the detailed instructions that come along. The results.....Whoa! My nose has been bothering me a great deal....those darn blackheads.....my pores have been enlarging.......I&#x27;ve tried other products to fight these symptoms, Dr. Perricone and Dr. Denese....both have good products but This Peel is solving the problem and fast too. Loving it! I have dry skin so I ordered and just received Skin Lab&#x27;s lactic acid which is recommended for dryer skin. But glad I started with this formula for a boost and the lactic will hopefully maintain. Go for it ladies. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS! This is potent stuff if you haven&#x27;t used anything like it before. Go slow. I had a peel done in my dr&#x27;s office a few years back and knew what to expect.....by the way, that simple peel was $125.00.</li>
    <li> I have mild acne and scarring and I&#x27;ve done salicylic peels at my dermatologist office with great results. When I saw this product, I thought what a great way to get the same results at home, boy was I wrong. The application part went fine and I felt the usual burning sensation. When I removed the product however, my face was more red than usual and it burned like hell. After suffering thrugh the night with the intense pain, I got up the next morning to find that my face looked like someone had thrown boiling water on me. I avoided work, friends and family for a few days while I went through the gruesome healin process. I have a somewhat caramel skin tone, and when the peeling started it revealed very pink skin which got darker with each passing day. The end result? I have what seems to be permanently discoloured skin- black scars all over which are obvious even with tonnes of makeup- which the dermatologist is makin a fortune off me to correct. I wish I could rathe this product 0.</li>
    <li> I put a little of the acid in my Biore astringent that has salycilic acid and IT WOKS!  It controls my acne and Iam 57 years old. Acne since 12. Had 3 dermabrassions and a face lift which did not work for the scars. If I do not use the acid I get acne again! Use and I do not get acne hardly.  BELIVE me I try everything! and this WORKS!!!! Clean skin. No Acne, no pus. Use it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I have struggled with problem skin and have spent $1000s of dollars on products and procedures.  None have compared to this product.  I am a lifelong consumer of this product.  One bit of advice: apply it with gloves on.  It will peel the skin on your hands/fingers.</li>
    <li> I had been using products that were costing me from $10 to $20 a week to use. I purchased those products at a Department store and at the local beauty supply. Each required I use their neutralizer, which gave me the impression that they could charge more for the product.    I found that this Peel, was more effective than what I had purchased elsewhere, I could use it less frequently for the same results, and I can neutralize it with plain water. This information, which the seller gave to me even before I purchased the product, allowed me to save $10 or more, to not having to purchase a neutralizer.     The seller, also, was as helpful as anyone at a store could have been. Because of that, I just purchased another product from them. Finally, the Free Shipping (and they pack it very well) made these purchases make even more sense for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed of how nice this product left my skin it peels horribly nice it takes a week to reveal the nicest skin you can have, same results i have at the doctors but without paying $100 every time and i have control how to use  at the doctors i had to give instructions all the way (like if i was teaching them)\\&quot;you missed this spot, i need more here, neutrilize here etc.\\&quot;, i apply it with make-up wedge sponge i got at rite aid however i would not recomend using if you have not used before i was gradually increased to 30% at my dermatologist the first time i ever tried it they used 30% and burned my face it took several smaller dosages of 20% to get rid of the burning marks on my face after a while they gave me 30% again and it worked fine they told me to try a glycolic %50 almost tha same strengt compared to 30% salisylic i tryed it and also liked it, i can&#x27;t afford to pay that amount every month any more i was sorprised to find this online i didn&#x27;t think twice i did compared to other brands but decided to go for this brand because the other didn&#x27;t have the two strengts i was looking for and also the price combined was less expensive, i got them on ebay is one of the best buys i ever had i used salicylic on my 15 yr old son only t zone and cleared his acne i also used the glycolic on my husb and he liked it very much. I guess people who is not satisfied don&#x27;t have the experience at the doctors so they have the grong item or strength for their skin type or age.</li>
    <li> It does seem to work, though I expected it to be a little stronger... I had had similar results exfolitating with aspirins (wetting an aspirin, and then using the wet powder)...though this seems to be a good complement (being liquid it seems to go deeper)... The aspiring exfoliating I believe is not recommended for pregnant women, or people allergic to aspirins...not sure if that applies to this product as well...</li>
    <li> 1 / Need use it 50/50 (50 Salicylic Acid 30% + 50 water)  2 / GLOVES  3 / * PUT IT ON THE THICK PARTS-&gt; CHEEKS ,.....  4 /  30 sec - 1MIN  5 / CLEAN IT (water + SOAP)  6 / put a moisturizer  7 / USE 5 DAYS -&gt; 1 week rest -&gt; AGAIN 5 DAYS  8 / DO NOT TOUCH THE FACE ...</li>
    <li> Previously had 30% Salicylic Acid applied to my face by my Medical Esthetician, and thought it was terrific! I ws excited when I saw this product--much cheaper than the ME. But...I have fair/sensitive/freckly skin, and this barely did anything at all. Very slight burning, very little lightening, and absolutely no peeling at all. Followed directions to the letter. I noticed there is no expiration date on the bottle whatsoever (would be helpful!) so maybe it was \\&quot;old\\&quot;. Anyway, I&#x27;ll apply again and keep upping the time in one minute increments, in hopes of seeing results. Unfortunately, wouldn&#x27;t buy this product from this company again.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase! I had been getting beta peels (salicylic acid) peels to get rid of my acne scars, but they were terribly expensive. I&#x27;ve been in the skincare business for almost 10 years and I&#x27;ve never used a product that mimicked the results of a professional peel like this! The instructional booklet is straight forward about the initial burning you&#x27;ll experience (you&#x27;ll have to have a hand-held fan or blow dryer with a cool setting or a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button). It isn&#x27;t as intense as the spa grade, but it&#x27;s running a close second lol! They&#x27;ll be a thin, transparent scab that will form over the next 2 to 3 days. On the third day it&#x27;ll begin to peel. A good complimentary product are the Peter Thomas Roth Max Correction Pads ( sephora.com or peterthomasroth.com). At 2% salicylic acid and a 10% glycolic acid complex, it will not only help exfoliate the dead skin (the pads have a textured side and a smooth side), but it&#x27;ll also help improve texture and tone in between treatments. I&#x27;m on my second peel and the scars have significantly reduced in size and color! So if you&#x27;re paying two arms and a leg at the spa for salicylic acid peels and you&#x27;re looking for a \\&quot;relief package\\&quot;, you&#x27;ve got to get this product. You&#x27;ll save time, money, and you can do it in the comfort of your own home!</li>
    <li> I want to warn you that this is very potent &amp; can burn your skin.  That being said, it works well to clear up breakouts.  I&#x27;m 40 years old &amp; still break out.  I have teenagers who have the same problem.  I tried it on my daughter straight for 2 minutes &amp; she was screaming that it was burning her...needless to say it did burn her face &amp; she had a scab for a couple of days.  However, I mixed 5 drops or so with skin cream &amp; applied it to my son (only at night) &amp; he has had great results with it.  So dont be afraid to try this because it does work, just be careful. I wouldn&#x27;t leave it on your face for longer than 1 minute the first time you try it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product hoping it would even my skin texture and tone and eliminate some of my problems.  I have very oily skin, mild breakouts, and blackheads on my nose.  I have been using lemon juice on my skin as a mild exfoliant for the past few months so maybe it created a tolerance for my skin against these low-grade chemical peels because I have used this product 3 times now and the application process is very tolerable (doesn&#x27;t burn badly at all - and I&#x27;ve left it on the full 5 minutes) and the promised results are pretty much imperceivable.  After each use, my skin seems tighter but the blackheads aren&#x27;t reduced and my pores don&#x27;t seem smaller.  Also, the top layers of my skin don&#x27;t peel off, as I assumed they would (and even welcomed the idea).  I can&#x27;t say this product has made any impact on my skin.  I&#x27;ll keep trying though.</li>
    <li> I noticed a little brighter complexion but frankly, not so much.  The customer service is great though.</li>
    <li> I have had professional peels, but I wanted something for home use. This peel is fantastic. It works very well on toning and lightly resurfacing the skin. I&#x27;m very happy with the price, but--even more so--with the results. I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This product has considerably lightened several acne scars.  I have a few very dark ones that I&#x27;m still working on.  I would definitely recommend this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NEVER USED CHEMICAL PEELS BEFORE, BUT I HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED IF THEY ACTUALLY WORKED. WELL, I DON&#x27;T KNOW ABOUT OTHER CHEMICAL PEELS, BUT THIS ONE DOES WORK. I HAVE BEEN USING IT ALMOST A MONTH NOW AND IT HAS IMPROVED THE LOOK AND FEEL OF MY FACE. IT HAS MADE MY ACNE SCARS ALMOST DISAPPEAR AND ALSO SOME OF THE SMALL LINES AND WRINKLES HAVE FADED AWAY. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This product may work well for some but for me it does not and I haven&#x27;t experienced any peeling with it.  I have tried to leave it on longer and use more often, however, bottom line, for my skin it is not strong enough.  Product did come fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the 20% by a different company with better results.  This stuff just doesn&#x27;t seem potent enough for me; I&#x27;m not sure if the company is mixing it with something else or what, but it&#x27;s not very good.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t receive the peel effect I was hoping for, the promptness and the extent to which the customer service went in order do work out my complaints are truly impressive! This seller is one of the most dedicated to custom care I&#x27;ve ever experienced on Amazon. Prompt delivery too. I will definitely try out some of their other products.</li>
    <li> WISH I COULD ADD PICS... the product completely burned my face and made holes and black spots. I am too ashamed to go to my dermatologist... I pray this heals quickly, I have avoided going outside and have been housebound the last three weeks. RIDICULOUS...I know its cheap but just go to your dermatologist to get this stuff done. I really dont like going but this is just ridiculous. I looks like I literally feel from a bike and scraped my face hard. Dermatologist said the highest she ever uses is 8% and 30% is for warts. Look up wart products, you&#x27;ll be able to verify this yourself. DONT USE!!!...</li>
    <li> This is a good product but I won&#x27;t buy it again, it worked fine the firsdt month but then it seemed to do nothing??? Maybe just me.</li>
