      <li>so I would recommend it :)</li>
      <li>i love this stuff</li>
      <li>This is my favorite face moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant, but not overly strong scent and soaks in quickly without being greasy.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product because i found a awesome deal on it, I normally use the Body Shop intense moisture cream, Which i love by the way!</li>
      <li>and so far I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
      <li>Very mosturizing and smells good.  </li>
      <li>If you ever are looking for a great, light and nourishing facial cream.</li>
      <li>Although I used to buy this from The Body Shop, I found that I didn&#x27;t always want to spend $50 to get their free shipping.</li>
      <li>This cream makes my skin feel absolutely smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
      <li>Light, doesn&#x27;t cake.  </li>
      <li>Its very moisturizing and smells nice and clean.</li>
      <li>I like the way it smells, smells like fresh powder and lilies!</li>
      <li>but it feels rich.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but something in this product made me break out into some kind of reaction.</li>
      <li>It makes my face nice and soft without getting too sticky.</li>
      <li>For my face i would not use their products-its full of parabens and chemicals and this cream was not an exception.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s a mild bummer.</li>
      <li>However, the scent is very strong for my sensitive nose and smells powdery.</li>
      <li>It is a very small amount but the price is great because in their store it would be a lot more.</li>
      <li>It a light moisturizer that has a slight and pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>I really like how easily this absorbs and how it smells.</li>
      <li>I am new to the body shop products but so far so good.</li>
      <li>and this doesn&#x27;t break me out or feel heavy on the skin - a great day and night cream.</li>
      <li>I really felt like the moisture was the perfect level of moisturizing but without being too thick and oily.</li>
      <li>Gives just the right amount of moisture.</li>
      <li>The scent of the entire Vitamin E collection is very strong</li>
      <li>purchased the vit e cream,very small for price.not as happy as i wish.it</li>
      <li>Natural products that are good for my skin, the Earth, against animal cruelty and supports human rights and self esteem!</li>
      <li>the first time I used it</li>
      <li>this is the first time I worte a review like this</li>
      <li>I put it on at night and wake up with smooth soft skin.</li>
      <li>id not expensive.</li>
      <li>But i thought i would give it a try since it was from the same line as my favorite moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It still has the same quality moisture that I loved but wish that scent was present.</li>
      <li>It is light, barely scented and affordable.  </li>
      <li>As described, fast shipping, thanks!</li>
      <li>probably doesn&#x27;t have too much of an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this moisturizer</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive old lady skin like mine, I use it everyday..  </li>
      <li>admittedly it wasn&#x27;t quite strong enough, but for normal skin/situations it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I originally bought the smaller jar that was in a sample pack</li>
      <li>I love it and use it 2 times everyday.</li>
      <li>This has never happened to me before, so I stopped using it immediately and start using a different face moisture, now my face is getting better but still very dry and hurts every time I put moisture on.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems with it.</li>
      <li>should be used very frequently.</li>
      <li>the picture looks pretty big, but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>And when you rub it in it turns to a water like consistency, dries very quickly and left my skin dry as it was to began with.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased Vitamin E Moisture Cream directly from the Body Shop before</li>
      <li>My only wish it that it didn&#x27;t contain so much fragrance or parabens</li>
      <li>give it a try in the store if you are sensitive.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer leaves skin hydrated and soft.  </li>
      <li>Makes me wonder if I got an old product and the sent was dulled?</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for regular hydration at a mid price point, this is worth trying.</li>
      <li>It is soft and really helps for dry skin!</li>
      <li>It might be a little heavy for the summer, I haven&#x27;t really been using it since it&#x27;s gotten hot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is inexpensive compared with luxury brands. I bought this for my aunt and she is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love the Vitamin E moisturizers. I have dry, but acne prone skin. I pair tea tree oil washes with Vitamin E moisturizers, and my skin is amazing.</li>
    <li> I love The Body shop butters,shower gels and oils.For my face i would not use their products-its full of parabens and chemicals and this cream was not an exception.Despite i like packing and smell i still feel its too heavy for my skin am 29 y.old so i will give it  to my mother.I will better stick on Dr.Haushka and Nuxe</li>
    <li> Great product! should be used very frequently.</li>
    <li> Light, doesn&#x27;t cake.  I keep ordering more of it.  My favorite moisturizer since Dove stopped making theirs- I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer leaves skin hydrated and soft.  However, the scent is very strong for my sensitive nose and smells powdery.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff because it is lightweight, non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t break me out. Best of all, it&#x27;s vegan! I use Amazon&#x27;s subscribe n&#x27; save so that I don&#x27;t run out before I can get to the store. Although I used to buy this from The Body Shop, I found that I didn&#x27;t always want to spend $50 to get their free shipping. Amazon solved my problem.</li>
    <li> this cream has a lovely scent and great texture, but irritated the skin on my chin a bit...i think it was due to the vitamin E content. if i had not experienced the irritation it would have been 5 stars. give it a try in the store if you are sensitive.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I love this line of products. I am new to the body shop products but so far so good. It is a very small amount but the price is great because in their store it would be a lot more. I will probably buy it again from this site.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and have been for years.  It is light, barely scented and affordable.  I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> purchased the vit e cream,very small for price.not as happy as i wish.it is ok.next time if i do buy,get a larger one</li>
    <li> i used this lotion this winter when my face was about to peel off. Its very moisturizing and smells nice and clean. It might be a little heavy for the summer, I haven&#x27;t really been using it since it&#x27;s gotten hot.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my skin feel absolutely smooth. It&#x27;s great for all skin types. Proof of that is that my mom and I, both, use it and love it!</li>
    <li> I really like how easily this absorbs and how it smells. It also leaves my skin feeling moisturized, but doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue feeling behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find sometimes it can irritate my skin a little, which could be from the fragrance or from the Vitamin E. I&#x27;ve also read that Vitamin E applied topically in creams like this probably doesn&#x27;t have too much of an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since started using Cerave, which I prefer.</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells, smells like fresh powder and lilies! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helped my skin I apply on my face from time to time. But I love products enriched with vitamin e so this is great</li>
    <li> Shipping was sooner than expected.  Love The Body Shop products!  Natural products that are good for my skin, the Earth, against animal cruelty and supports human rights and self esteem!</li>
    <li> I will buy this product again and again. Gives just the right amount of moisture. I put it on at night and wake up with smooth soft skin. Not oily. I have combination skin. Dry on the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; but vitamin E helps that.</li>
    <li> As described, fast shipping, thanks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but something in this product made me break out into some kind of reaction. I had tiny little bumps all over my chin and nose area, and it continued to spread until I stopped using it. I wasted money on this; I don&#x27;t recommend it. I was disappointed that a product from The Body Shop would cause such a reaction, but it is what it is.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for my face. I love it and use it 2 times everyday.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the smaller jar that was in a sample pack and i can not get enough of it. i love this stuff and i wear it everyday.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mini Vitamin E moisture cream to make a &amp;#34;minimum purchase&amp;#34; threshold. It smells a little like the old style Johnson&#x27;s baby lotion but it feels rich. It hydrates immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been alternating this with more expensive moisturizers, and the quality of the Vitamin E doesn&#x27;t stand out.&lt;br /&gt;Not a bargain but if you&#x27;re looking for regular hydration at a mid price point, this is worth trying.</li>
    <li> the picture looks pretty big, but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Soaks into the skin beautifully.</li>
    <li> If you ever are looking for a great, light and nourishing facial cream. Try this one from the Body Shop. And best of all - it id not expensive.Have been using it for years and now I have it at my fingertips through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Hydrates well but couldn&#x27;t get past how thick and heavy it felt compared to other Body Shop products I&#x27;ve used. The scent of the entire Vitamin E collection is very strong so I don&#x27;t use the products I have left on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> It is soft and really helps for dry skin! I enjoyed it a lot so I would recommend it :)</li>
    <li> It a light moisturizer that has a slight and pleasant scent.  The vitamin E is a complexion bonus.</li>
    <li> This is a very solidly nice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it may not be enough for those with really dry skin.  I bought it just before winter when my skin dries up like crazy and admittedly it wasn&#x27;t quite strong enough, but for normal skin/situations it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant, but not overly strong scent and soaks in quickly without being greasy.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase this cream for quite some time now after trying the sample. I love the scent (LOVE), the texture, the results. It makes my face nice and soft without getting too sticky. My skin tends to get dry during the cold months, and this cream has been lovely to me.</li>
    <li> One of the best products in class</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using it for years and it always leaves my skin feeling hydrated! I put this on after i wash my face and then put on my bronzer. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily at all it is an all around great product! I love the light smell it has also! I am so happy I bought this product on amazon with the option to have it automatically sent to my house every 2 months..that is soo amazing!</li>
    <li> the first time I used it my face felt great, it moisturized my skin and everything. After a few times using it my skin turned extremely dried and start hurting when I put any type of moisture on. This has never happened to me before, so I stopped using it immediately and start using a different face moisture, now my face is getting better but still very dry and hurts every time I put moisture on. this is the first time I worte a review like this but I do not suggest anyone getting this product, it worked horribly, I wish I have never bought it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 years. I have oily/sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t break me out or feel heavy on the skin - a great day and night cream.</li>
    <li> Feels like I&#x27;m in the airport. No deals here!</li>
    <li> I have combination acne prone skin. As the cold weather arrived my cheeks became rough and dry. My usually gel moisturizer and exfoliating was not helping. I was hesitant to use this as I am acne prone but I gave it a try one night before bed and woke up with smoother brighter skin. A few days later I used it again since I didnt break out from it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and so far I&#x27;m very pleased! I wish I would have tried his sooner. My only wish it that it didn&#x27;t contain so much fragrance or parabens but it makes my skin so healthy looking so ill continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I bought this vitamin e cream for my scar.  It is working well.  Very mosturizing and smells good.  I recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because i found a awesome deal on it, I normally use the Body Shop intense moisture cream, Which i love by the way! But i thought i would give it a try since it was from the same line as my favorite moisturizer. The cream is very thin which i did not like. And when you rub it in it turns to a water like consistency, dries very quickly and left my skin dry as it was to began with. I will not be repurchasing this cream.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive old lady skin like mine, I use it everyday..  I love body shop products.  You should buy it.</li>
    <li> When I ran out of this, my face hated me for weeks until I finally re-bought it. I use it along side my regular acne regimen which doesn&#x27;t come with a moisturizer for some reason.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face moisturizer.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  I wear it every day and I never have issues with breakouts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people love this stuff. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin whatsoever, but this broke me out bad. It also smells just like Raid the Bug Spray! I can get over the smell if something works well, but this smells so bad and it broke me out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Vitamin E Moisture Cream directly from the Body Shop before and I loved it! I really felt like the moisture was the perfect level of moisturizing but without being too thick and oily. I also felt like my skin was firmer after using it for a while, like it was a little anti-aging!! I joked and said it was Botox in a bottle! I loved the baby powder fresh smell of it, too. I ordered a new one from Amazon when I was out but am a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same fresh baby powder scent. It still has the same quality moisture that I loved but wish that scent was present. Makes me wonder if I got an old product and the sent was dulled? I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s a mild bummer. It doesn&#x27;t make me displeased over all, but I&#x27;ll probably pick the item up at the store next time.</li>
    <li> Works well doesn&#x27;t make face oily..blends in super fast...very pleased!! will be using this moisturei for now on ..i won&#x27;t use any other product!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer and I&#x27;ve been using it for years, but I was disappointed to find the black cap scratched up and the lid missing, and sticker lopsided and full of air bubbles. Unfortunately, the item was illegible for exchange. I would recommend buying from another seller or buying in store instead.</li>
