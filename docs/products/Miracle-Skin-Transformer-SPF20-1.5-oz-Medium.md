<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using this for several years now and I can find no equal, so I stopped looking.</li>
    <li> It is a great product.  What I plan to do is buy the lightest shade and mix it with medium.  You&#x27;ll be very happy as it goes on smoothly and just mattifies enough to stay in place.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like you have nothing on your skin.  Fabulous!</li>
    <li> I just love this product. Light coverage with good stuff for my skin. I use it everyday with a layer of Olay CC Cream. I get compliments on my skin regularly!</li>
    <li> Just discovered this on a GREAT sale at Costco. Medium color only. But does that matter? I see this as a replacement for my Benefit Pore-fessional primer, which until now is the only thing I have found that really makes pores vanish (or appear to). I&#x27;m transitioning to all cosmetics products that don&#x27;t test on animals, and this has been the hardest item to replace, until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any coverage or color with this. Maybe it just matches my skin exactly, but it looks and feels just like the (basically invisible) Benefit product, but better because it has SPF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need real coverage like foundation, just consider this as a primer and all products you put on top will look much better. So glad to have discovered this!</li>
    <li> I love the matte finish of this cream.  The sunscreen works great and doesn&#x27;t smell.  I only use this for my sunscreen, moisturizer and base.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! Goes on smooth and not greasy at all, absorbs wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great for travel so I don&#x27;t have to take several products.</li>
    <li> I first saw product at  Costco.  I loved it but they discontinued carrying. it.  I was thrilled to find it again. Great product.  I also bought some for my Mom. She loves it as well.  It was delivered in a tie,ely manner.  We  would like to continue using it.</li>
    <li> This is very light weight, has slight coverage for darkened or red areas, but coverage is minimal. I use a Garnier produce under it when I want more coverage.  What I love is; It feels light, does not cause breakouts, and has the SPF in it….an all in one product.  Couldn&#x27;t get easier that that.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Doesn&#x27;t fill creases and lines in face. Very lightweight on face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, it gives great coverage yet is so light it&#x27;s like you have nothing on your skin.  It goes on so smoothly and feels like silk.  This is the 4th tube I have purchased, it is kinda hard to find so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> this product does exactly what it says it will; my skin looks and feels flawless and the compliments from my friends are pouring in on how good my skin looks! I am acne prone and oily, and this prof it helps with improving my skin tone, covering up acne scars, as well as mattifying my skin. This product stopped selling at sephora so thank goodness I can order it here!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my mom had it and I had tried it out. I really like the silky smooth way it makes my face feel, and it&#x27;s not too heavy. It doesn&#x27;t give complete coverage though, so if you have something you&#x27;d like to cover up it is pretty sheer and probably won&#x27;t do the job, but I just solve that problem with a little bit of concealer. Overall, it makes your face smooth and helps with the overall color of your skin tone (reduces redness and shiny-ness) and I would recommend this makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, a little bit goes a long way! So I think the little tube will last a long time!</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have noted, this product is very light both in coverage and color. I normally wear &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; in any foundation but am a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; in this product. Looks darker from tube than it is when you apply. Blends fine. I love this product specifically for travel. It meets security standards, it&#x27;s all-in-one coverage, and meets my have to get going FAST mode when traveling and don&#x27;t have time for a detailed routine. Doesn&#x27;t cover my sun damage spots much, but at least provides sun protection and evens out skin tones. Just know it will not provide a perfect, flawless, matte finish as a normal separate primer/foundation/powder would. For that reason, 4 stars, because the advertising implies that it will.</li>
    <li> Need to use a bit longer....do not expect much coverage, but it is an excellent primer for the face, at a great price.  Lots of good ingredients for the skin as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> Very nice skin makeup.  Goes on smooth and gives you a nice tan appearance.</li>
    <li> This the best BB cream I have used. It has a nice matte finish.</li>
    <li> Does not feel like you are wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> I only use this product when I have a day full of errands and need sunscreen protection. It blend well and it has a weird sheen (the lady at Sephora called it &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;... I think not). I probably won&#x27;t purchase again just cause I don&#x27;t find it to be any better than drug store BB-creams.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Light feel, covers great, seems to even have helped my rosacea. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Not as much coverage as expected.</li>
    <li> I like this makeup as a moisturizer and a pore minimizer, BUT the coverage is definitely minimal. Unless the price goes down, I will find something else when this runs out. It&#x27;s nice, but not worth the $48 price tag.</li>
    <li> Such a great product.  I use with Vit C and Hyaluronic serum and feel wonderful all day.  I&#x27;ve tried several moisturizers under it and found that they all peel up; so forget your other moisturizers and use this.</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation!!! You never look like you have makeup on. Your skin looks beautiful every time.</li>
    <li> Favorite primer. Smoothes nicely. This is probably my 3rd tube. 66 yrs old, moderately wrinkled.</li>
    <li> Looks so natural  and has good  staying power</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  It is great to use before applying base or by itself.</li>
    <li> Helps my face look a little smoother. Not as &amp;#34;transforming&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love it, feels great on skin and great coverup!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great Glad I discovered it makes my face feel so soft and minimizes pores. I recommend it to all the ladies</li>
    <li> Gives my skin a great, smooth appearance.  Very light and easy to apply without the appearance of most foundations.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! it&#x27;s a bit pricey so when I can&#x27;t squeeze any more out of the tube, I cut the bottom open &amp; a lot is left. I keep it in a zip lock until all is used. I won&#x27;t go without it!</li>
    <li> This product really does transform the face- gives a smooth, airbrushed quality. Glides easily over skin and fills in pores, lines, and covers imperfections. I have oily- acne-prone skin and this never greases up or migrates even after having it on all day. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it could work so well until I tried a sample. I hardly ever wear foundation now since I tried this. Feels so light on and with SPF, it&#x27;s good for your skin. Fabulous product!</li>
    <li> Great product kept me from being oily</li>
    <li> Like this cream so much I bought some for my sister. It haas great coverage and is easy to apply. Gives your skin a uniform appearance.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, velvety smooth coverage that is light as a feather.  I love it and my friends who have tried mine are ordering their own.&lt;br /&gt;Ann Best&lt;br /&gt;Austin TX.</li>
    <li> Goes on so soft and smooth! Coverage isn&#x27;t great but I like it for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this product for a long time and love it.</li>
    <li> I read reviews in Forbes Magazine on this product stating it could be worn alone because it contained all the ingredients for moisturizer, SPF and skin repair treatments. I tried it once and it dried out my face and flaked off. Very disappointed when looking for an all in one product for a quick natural cover when running errands. Another product to throw in a box of many tries.</li>
    <li> I bought Miracle Skin at Costco just to give it a try and I was pleasently surprised!&lt;br /&gt;I put lotion on my face first and then I put the Miracle Skin on top of it. When the product came out of the tube it looked dark and I was concerned that it would not work for me but after blending it onto my face it blended very nicely and the color was perfect. A tiny bit goes a long way. This stuff is like silk, it blends nicely. I&#x27;ve tried it both ways, with and without lotion underneath. I like the results much better with lotion underneath. I did notice that the coverage is lite, I was hoping for more, but with the way it makes your skin look and feel I&#x27;m happy with this product! I wear it almost everyday. I&#x27;m not sure it will be dark enough for me in the summer after a tan though. I was hoping they made a darker shade. I&#x27;ll keep buying it though because it&#x27;s better then anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for light coverage on mature skin</li>
    <li> the tube almost seemed a little (not full) :-(</li>
    <li> Love this.  I first got it at Costco and was very happy to see it here.  It covers just enough to still look natural.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! This goes on and leaves your skin silky smooth. I have tried many brands and I have to say that this is my favorite one. this is definitely worth the money, it lasts a long time - all you need to use is less than a size of a pearl - that amount will cover your entire face.</li>
    <li> Feels great and looks good. I will not leave home without it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  It&#x27;s light, provides sunscreen, and looks flawless.  A great product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as well as the one I purchase from Costco, but it will work.</li>
    <li> Love!  I have very sensitive skin and this is perfect!</li>
    <li> I love thus product. Goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I do ordering this BB cream all the time -very happy with result on skin-soft, smooth, protecting from sun and looks natural</li>
    <li> Very pleased with it. Makes the skin smooth and reduces pores.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to foundation.  I love the way it makes my skin feel, and I&#x27;m comfortable with it&#x27;s light coverage.  I use a concealer on top for trouble spots.</li>
    <li> It gives my face a more refresh look. It goes on smoothly. I cover by face&lt;br /&gt;with it and my neck. Then, I apply bronzer; then blush. This is my second&lt;br /&gt;time purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Love the product, great price for it!</li>
