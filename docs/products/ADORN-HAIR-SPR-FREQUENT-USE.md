      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>This product is the greatest hair spray ever made.</li>
      <li>Was very happy to fine it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I use a lot of spray and my hair still feels good with Adorn.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many many years but can&#x27;t find it in the stores, so happy to find it here.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Everyone cuts costs, to make more money.</li>
      <li>Would like azamon to replace order with the orginal that we have used for more than 30 years.</li>

      <li>Glad to find it here since I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair in place and never weighs it down.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves it manageable  and perfect all day long.</li>
      <li>They forever have had a easy spray head.</li>
      <li>great product, wish I could find it in the local stores</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair natural looking, is not sticky, and doesn&#x27;t build up so you can use it more than one day and not have to wash your hair.</li>
      <li>Many people are allergic to various scents, and</li>
      <li>Why, exactly, what are you trying to hide.  </li>
      <li>what I love about it is at the end of the day when I would brush my hair, my hair was still soft and it never had the heavy sticky feeling that most hair spray&#x27;s have.  </li>
      <li>Works very well for me.  </li>
      <li>Thanks  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It is very reliable for frequent use.</li>
      <li>I always used Adorn Hair Spray in the White &amp; Pink can, that really is my favorite because it was unsented</li>
      <li>Other discontinued u scented extra hold was much better</li>
      <li>:B000GCWK8C Adorn Hair Spray Frequent Use, 7.5 oz]]</li>
      <li>All of that stuff nearly gags me.  </li>
      <li>Great product--hard to find-that explains the cost of it --which is expensive for hair spray!</li>
      <li>Wish Gillette would bring back the original unscented, green can, Adorn.  </li>
      <li>Love Adorn hope it never is outdated.</li>

<li> What is wrong with the smell of just plain clean, or open the windows for some fresh air --</li>
<li> Bring back the Pink &amp; White Adorn Hair Spray!</li>
<li> it holds your hair but brushes out, is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel dirty like so many others.</li>
<li> the pink &amp; white can never had that smell also</li>
<li> I was thrilled to see Adorn back on the market, but disappointed in the product.  </li>
<li> Without all those other odors, it will be a purer smell.  </li>
<li> Also, it has a very wide spray stream, gets all over everything.  </li>
<li> A lot of money wasted, considering the shipping.</li>
<li> Heavy spray makes for &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; application.</li>
<li> yes even in the winter, air the house out for a few minutes.</li>
<li> now.&lt;br /&gt;It works so well; its never leaves your hair stiff, just holds well.</li>
<li> I am not able to use it,</li>
<li> She has used it in the past and likes the product</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it is very hard to find in the stores these days</li>
<li> I have been unable to find this hair spray in the stores for a while</li>
<li> Too bad California stopped selling it.</li>
<li> disappointed .</li>

    <li> I ordered 2 cans and only received one can.</li>
    <li> great product, wish I could find it in the local stores</li>
    <li> This product is the greatest hair spray ever made. It holds your hair without any stiffness or stickiness, and it does not build up ever! I can&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t sell it in the stores anymore. I grew up using it, and then one day they stopped selling it in stores. Thank God I found it again recently online. I&#x27;ll never stop using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Other discontinued u scented extra hold was much better</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my wife.  She has used it in the past and likes the product and we could not find it localy, so we  purchased it on line.</li>
    <li> For years we have used Adorn. They forever have had a easy spray head. Now these have a akward ,(take off the lid), aand a nozzell, like on a can of deodrant.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed . Everyone cuts costs, to make more money. Would like azamon to replace order with the orginal that we have used for more than 30 years.</li>
    <li> It left a sticky while residue on my hair after washing.  This product was the only thing different that I was using, so it must be caused by it.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of spray and my hair still feels good with Adorn.  It is very reliable for frequent use.</li>
    <li> TRIED TO FIND A HAIR SPRAY THAT HOLDS YET DOES NOT CAUSE BUILD UP.  I DIDN&#x27;T GET THE CHANCE TO SEE IF IT CAUSED BUILD UP BECAUSE IT DOESN&#x27;T EVEN HOLD.</li>
    <li> Works very well for me.  Thanks  Cannot go out of the house without using this product.  Too bad California stopped selling it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Adorn for over 50 years</li>
    <li> Again, a product I have used now for over 20 years, won&#x27;t use anything else, will continue to order this constantly from your company.</li>
    <li> I like it because it has no build-up</li>
    <li> I always used Adorn Hair Spray in the White &amp; Pink can, that really is my favorite because it was unsented and it would hold my hair in place what I love about it is at the end of the day when I would brush my hair, my hair was still soft and it never had the heavy sticky feeling that most hair spray&#x27;s have.  This blue one is alright but it smells like I have hair spray the pink &amp; white can never had that smell also the Blue can has a sticky feeling to it... Bring back the Pink &amp; White Adorn Hair Spray!</li>
    <li> This product is not unscented, as was indicated.  Also, it has a very wide spray stream, gets all over everything.  Wish Gillette would bring back the original unscented, green can, Adorn.  I was thrilled to see Adorn back on the market, but disappointed in the product.  A lot of money wasted, considering the shipping. I am not able to use it, so out it goes. As an aside, I do not understand scented anything -- hair sprays, deorderants, shampoos, etc.  Many people are allergic to various scents, and furthermore, why have all the competing scents.  Doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  You want a scent, buy one, as in cologne or perfume.  Without all those other odors, it will be a purer smell.  Also do not get scented laundry detergents and fabric softeners.  What is the point.  All of that stuff nearly gags me.  Ditto, smelling up one&#x27;s home with all those artifical air fresheners.  Why, exactly, what are you trying to hide.  What is wrong with the smell of just plain clean, or open the windows for some fresh air -- yes even in the winter, air the house out for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I have used Adorn Hair Spray for years. It is the only hair spray I will use. It leaves your hair natural looking, is not sticky, and doesn&#x27;t build up so you can use it more than one day and not have to wash your hair. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find in the stores these days so you have to buy it online.[[ASIN:B000GCWK8C Adorn Hair Spray Frequent Use, 7.5 oz]]</li>
    <li> Mist is non-existent ! Heavy spray makes for &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; application.</li>

    <li> I have been unable to find this hair spray in the stores for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;It works so well; its never leaves your hair stiff, just holds well. I desided to&lt;br /&gt;look for it on line. Was very happy to fine it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use Adorn X-Hold, this does not hold my hair as well.  I would not recommend it to any one</li>
    <li> Love Adorn hope it never is outdated.</li>
    <li> Great product--hard to find-that explains the cost of it --which is expensive for hair spray!</li>
