      <li>It delivers fast, product is fresh and the best thing is, this is way cheaper than to get in near my place.</li>
      <li>At first I thought this was a bunch of BS!!</li>
      <li>but it is definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>but the Special Cleansing Gel firms my skin and makes my pores seem to disappear.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a much needed boost for the nighttime repair period :)</li>
      <li>I have used this hydrating booster for many years as a moisture around my eyes, after becoming allergic to many other eye moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>The Skin Renewal Booster effectively treats rosacea bumps, milia and red patchy skin.</li>
      <li>Not too much application but just enough film to cover the whole face to look good.</li>
      <li>and I can definitely say that I have had the most success with the Dermalogica line.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says on the bottle.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought a bit pricey.</li>
      <li>This is the first Dermalogica product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I am almost 43 years old and most people guess my age in the early 30&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I know how hard it is to find products that are gentle enough for sensitive skin,yet effective enough to achieve very good results.</li>
      <li>With this combo, it works very well.</li>
      <li>This was shipped fast.</li>
      <li>and I really believe that oftentimes</li>
      <li>This product really keeps my face hydrated.  </li>
      <li>It really works well with their moisturizer</li>
      <li>For the most part, I use this booster as a spot treatment, followed by Active Moist moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I alternate my cleanser between the Skin Renewal Cleanser and the Special Cleansing Gel.</li>
      <li>, I still applied this booster for a few more days and my skin looked so supple and smooth, quite different from what it looked like the week before.</li>
      <li>The combo works great and this small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It smooths across my skin so nicely and it is not loaded with any artificial colors of fragrances like so many</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
      <li>I mix a few drops in with my dermalogica skin hydrating masque, works great especially with my super sensitive dry skin!</li>
      <li>It gently, quickly and effectively renews my skin without leaving it overly dry, tight or red.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product as my first layer of moisturizing after cleansing, for the last 2 days.</li>
      <li>But as my skin ages, I feel the need to try new exfoliation products that are designed for mature skin issues.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of this product either as a little goes a long way and therefore the bottle will last for quite some time, which is a good thing since this is pricey</li>
      <li>My skin is firmer and pores are clean and less noticeable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s totally clear, scent-free and</li>
      <li>I consider the Skin Renewal Cleanser as a treatment that leaves my skin incredibly soft-</li>
      <li>Each time I have gone for a facial I have been told that my skin is very hydrated.  </li>
      <li>This is the only line of products I have not broken out from</li>
      <li>I developed a sensitivity to a prescription I&#x27;d been using</li>
      <li>I slather it on directly under my eyes am &amp; pm.</li>
      <li>I live in Arizona so dry skin is a real problem.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not more readily available.</li>
      <li>It usually takes 2 layers of moisturizer (Dermalogical intensive Moisure Balance with Nuetrogena Healthy Defense SPF over it) to make sure my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after a few hours.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m mid 40&#x27;s, strawberry blonde &amp; freckles with SUPER dry skin &amp; hair.</li>
      <li>Really helping my skin to stay hydrated in very dry weather conditions.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, I found it on here for less than half of the price! :)</li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate and now that I&#x27;m 50</li>
      <li>I started applying this one on my entire face (along with the hydrocortisone cream which I applied and dried first to treat the rashes) and my face started becoming less stiff.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this and other Dermalogica products.</li>
      <li>It also does NOT cause acne or dry sensitive skin to burn/ turn red.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I mix a few drops in with my dermalogica skin hydrating masque, works great especially with my super sensitive dry skin!</li>
    <li> Its a great product like the rest of the dermalogica line. It makes my skin tighten and I feel a smoothness that I havent felt before.  Expensive for a little bottle</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it works wonders everytime. Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not more readily available.</li>
    <li> I Love the dermalogica Skin Hydrating Booster. It really works well with their moisturizer and I use it daily. I live in a dry climate and now that I&#x27;m 50+ I need extra hydration. It is fragrance free and very smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used this hydrating booster for many years as a moisture around my eyes, after becoming allergic to many other eye moisturizers.  No allergies with this skin hydrating booster.</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy this product again.  It helps my dry skin in the winter.  One of my favorite products</li>
    <li> Really helping my skin to stay hydrated in very dry weather conditions. I use it with a Dermalogica moisturizer and love the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product as my first layer of moisturizing after cleansing, for the last 2 days. It seems to be helping to soften the dry skin wrinkles I was getting, and along with my moisturizer that I use by Derma E, my face finally doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry anymore.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I had very dry flakey skin on parts of my face. I used the hydrating booster with the dermalogica moisturizer &amp; I could actually apply my make up without it looking too cakey. I have tried everything from pure shea butter to expensive moisturizers that never seemed to fully work.  This is by far the best. It also does NOT cause acne or dry sensitive skin to burn/ turn red. This is a must have. The product lasts me a long time too.</li>
    <li> the effect this had on my skin was amazing. no more dullness. I&#x27;ll buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same Dermalogica products for years and I am a huge fan. But as my skin ages, I feel the need to try new exfoliation products that are designed for mature skin issues. This product is everything I hoped for and more. It gently, quickly and effectively renews my skin without leaving it overly dry, tight or red. It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin \\&quot;super-flakey.\\&quot; My skin is firmer and pores are clean and less noticeable. I also have rosacea which complicates things. The Skin Renewal Booster effectively treats rosacea bumps, milia and red patchy skin. I know how hard it is to find products that are gentle enough for sensitive skin,yet effective enough to achieve very good results. I have tried just about everything out there and I can definitely say that I have had the most success with the Dermalogica line. I alternate my cleanser between the Skin Renewal Cleanser and the Special Cleansing Gel. I love them both and can&#x27;t commit to just one! I consider the Skin Renewal Cleanser as a treatment that leaves my skin incredibly soft- but the Special Cleansing Gel firms my skin and makes my pores seem to disappear. I was using the Daily Microfoliant with a prescription Retin A product, but the Renova left my face feeling very dry, tight and red- effective against wrinkles, but not ideal for my rosacea. I have found that the Skin Renewal Booster works just as well as Rx products and I don&#x27;t have to suffer from unpleasant side effects. Plus it got rid of a couple of little, yet highly annoying red patches that were below my eye. For the most part, I use this booster as a spot treatment, followed by Active Moist moisturizer. This booster can also be mixed together with your moisturizer for all-over coverage and may help the booster last longer. Either way, the product works great. As with all Dermalogica products, a little bit goes a long way and I really believe that oftentimes \\&quot;less\\&quot; is more. I have had chemical peels, IPLs,Botox, Radiesse, Fraxel...you name it!!! I honestly believe that my skin looks just as good using Dermalogica products faithfully on a daily basis. Skip the harsh stuff and give this booster a try!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says on the bottle.  I use 4-5 drops of this under my Intensive Moisture Balance for face &amp; neck. Sinks in beautifully, a perfect boost.</li>
    <li> I love the brand and everything I used from them. This time I ordered the wrong item but will give it away as a gift because its not for my skin type.</li>
    <li> I use this only in the evening because it does add a bit of &#x27;shine&#x27; to your face. But, for those of us over 40 it&#x27;s a much needed boost for the nighttime repair period :)</li>
    <li> I add a couple drops of this to my morning moisturizer.....works great.  It gives a dew effect to brighten things up.</li>
    <li> I developed a sensitivity to a prescription I&#x27;d been using and I had this nasty rash across my face (not to mention itchiness all over). I stopped the prescription, and eventually the rashes dried out, but it also left my facial skin extremely dry. I couldn&#x27;t even move my face that much because it felt so stiff and when I did move my facial muscles, the wrinkles were horrible, I looked so old. I started applying this one on my entire face (along with the hydrocortisone cream which I applied and dried first to treat the rashes) and my face started becoming less stiff. I also upped my water drinking frequency so it could have also helped. Eventually the rashes were gone and I stopped using the hydrocortisone cream, I still applied this booster for a few more days and my skin looked so supple and smooth, quite different from what it looked like the week before. I&#x27;m now a fan of this product.</li>
    <li> I love how smooth my face feels!  I use this at night. Love it!</li>
    <li> This was shipped fast. However, what it says on the product description and packing slip is not what I recieved. I recieved the hydrating booster. In defense of the vendor, I was leaving town and did not have time to send it back for exchange. I do use this product and it is great.   I do recommend them as they have great prices and ship fast. I will use them again.    Thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Makes me look 10 years younger! I would highly recommend this and other Dermalogica products. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 5 years and my skin is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the only line of products I have not broken out from</li>
    <li> This is the first Dermalogica product I&#x27;ve used. You use a small dot on the dry areas of your skin then apply massage over your skin and throat. My skin feels much more supple after using this I then apply a moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t seen a reduction in redness or wrinkles, but my age-related acne seems to be clearing up.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely dry, and during the winter months, I need a little extra boost. This Hydrating Booster does help my skin. Sometimes I have to re-apply under my eyes half way through the day, but it&#x27;s just due to how dry my skin is.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was a bunch of BS!! A spa worker insisted that I get it due to the fact that my skin is on the dry side... I thought \\&quot;hydrating booster??? why not just use moisturizer??\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this stuff makes a HUGE difference!!! It smooths across my skin so nicely and it is not loaded with any artificial colors of fragrances like so many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s totally clear, scent-free and although it seems oily when you squeeze it out, you realize that it does not leave your skin oily at all when you rub it in. It just makes it smoooooth.  I use my moisturizer over it most of the time, but sometimes, I just use this and it&#x27;s awesome.  It absorbs VERY quickly too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this and will continue to use it! Thankfully, I found it on here for less than half of the price! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fellow dry skin peeps should seriously give this a whirl.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Dermalogica products. But after using this booster, my face got covered with red and itchy spots.</li>
    <li> Not sure about it. Didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> I live in Arizona so dry skin is a real problem.  This product really keeps my face hydrated.  I have been using this product for a couple of years.  Each time I have gone for a facial I have been told that my skin is very hydrated.  I believe it is because of this product.  It feels great going on and dries quickly then I put on my daily moisturizer.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of this product either as a little goes a long way and therefore the bottle will last for quite some time, which is a good thing since this is pricey but it is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I just buy this product for my wife as a gift on her birthday. One time, she said that she loved it so much.</li>
    <li> It delivers fast, product is fresh and the best thing is, this is way cheaper than to get in near my place. I would recommend this to anyone at any day!</li>
    <li> love it! i help my skin keeps hydrated and it doesn&#x27;t iritate the skin... great and i like it. will buy it again.</li>
    <li> One of the best products out there. This has been a lifesaver to me. I get a reaction sometimes under my eyes like a dry wrinkly patch and this is the only thing that has worked. I slather it on directly under my eyes am &amp; pm. It is also great mixed with moisturizer</li>
    <li> There were so many good reviews, that I thought this would be perfect for me!  I&#x27;m mid 40&#x27;s, strawberry blonde &amp; freckles with SUPER dry skin &amp; hair. It usually takes 2 layers of moisturizer (Dermalogical intensive Moisure Balance with Nuetrogena Healthy Defense SPF over it) to make sure my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after a few hours.  I used this serum after my usual vitamin CE Ferulic &amp; before moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My result?  I found myself tapping extra moisuturizer over teh skin during the day or offset an unusual dry tight feeling.  Go figure!  I&#x27;m disappointed with this product &amp; will try to return it if possible.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Skin Hydrating Booster (which is supposed to serve as a moisturizer) instead I received the skin renewal Booster - which requires that you follow up with a moisturizer. Because the bottles look identical, I opened it and used it before I noticed. Be careful ordering these products from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica skin products for a little less than a year. I am a firm believer in taking care of my skin. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product line, especially with the Skin Hydrating Booster. I am almost 43 years old and most people guess my age in the early 30&#x27;s. Once you try Demalogica, you won&#x27;t buy another brand!</li>
    <li> Have been using for a while and it does works well.  Not too much application but just enough film to cover the whole face to look good.</li>
    <li> At first I thought a bit pricey. But then all I use is 3-4 drops mixed in with some Effective-A cream by DCL. The combo works great and this small bottle lasts a long time. I have dry skin in the winter and can have the tendency to get a little oily in other times of year. With this combo, it works very well.</li>
