    <li> I bought this for my fiance for Christmas. It smells so good and the price is right. I had a sample hanging up on my memo board and every time I passed it, I could smell it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and oh my god it smells so good. Even when we go out other ladies are complimenting him. Imagine what he gets when I&#x27;m not around haha. So if you are the jealous type don&#x27;t buy this for your significant other ;)</li>
    <li> I have gone through multiple bottles of cologne before stumbling upon Armani Code Sport, and I believe I have finally found the scent I am looking for. The cologne smells like the offspring of Beckham Signature and Aqua Di Gio, a nice, masculine (but not musky) and unique scent.</li>
    <li> It is kind of strong. Stronger than regular code, but it is more citrus smell, like lemon. I do like it but I probably will get something else next time.</li>
    <li> of course this is a subjective opinion, I prefer the original over the this. This has too much stuff inside it. Makes me busy :)</li>
    <li> Smell lastes all day and is a woman pleaser. Much cheaper online too.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my brother-in-laws birthday and I think it smells wonderful!  I know he is going to love it too!</li>
    <li> Arrived when expected.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> Smells great and chicks dig it.</li>
    <li> An awesome deal, fast ship and a great price. I was looking for this as a gift for my husband but didn&#x27;t want to pay the retail price since it was out of my budget and this fit perfectly. A great scent for a guy of any age and my husband loved it when he tried it and I really like it on him. If you&#x27;re looking for a new scent for your guy this is a great one to try.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! Arrived on time...</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my husband and he loves it . It smells similar to Aqua di Gio but is different at the same tine. I am giving it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I expected. Bt it is still an amazing perfume for any guy. And Ladies you will love it on your man</li>
    <li> This is truly an excellent summer fragrance for men.  To me, it smells much more masculine than the Armani Code &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; version.  It gets good compliments.  The longevity is very good.</li>
    <li> Armani Code Sport! I tried this cologne on at a party. By the end of the night, say, 2-3 hours, the cologne wore off. The scent is great, and I just wish that they made a more concentrated version of this, like maybe an eau de parfum (EDP). The scent is minty at first, and then changes into a more citrusy and more fruity scent. All in all, it is a great buy for the summertime!</li>
    <li> One of my favorites and the price is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> It was just what i expected.</li>
    <li> Pleasant fragrance, nice bottle, right size. It&#x27;s great like a gift to the man you love. I definitely recommend to men age 25-35.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loved it.  It smells so clean and fresh.  Definitely a nice addition to his collection of cologne.</li>
    <li> Worked like it always has. Not sold in stores anymore so very nice to find on here.</li>
    <li> Armani does it again. Scent is close to Code with a little more piazza. Highly recommend if you like Code. Thank You Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> I feel it could have been better as I saw on the display at Dillard&#x27;s store the cent isn&#x27;t as strong I thought it would be</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, for Christmas, and love it more than his old Armani Code. It lingers all day after he&#x27;s sprayed it in the bathroom, and has gone to work. The scent makes me melt!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful stocking stuffer for my son. Buy it every year. The price is right.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this cologne for a while. It isn&#x27;t cheap but smell lasts long time and smells great.</li>
    <li> Excellent, great fragrance, perfect for after a workout</li>
    <li> Love it, my teen son say he receive compliments daily and is asked what he uses that smells so good!</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. I knew the product and I got exactly what I expected from the add in your store.</li>
    <li> Not a bad cologne and the scent dosen&#x27;t seem to last for me.But it does the job..</li>
    <li> Thought it was a little bigger, but regardless great product. smells great!</li>
