### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for those puffy eyed mornings.</li>
      <li>Their make-up remover and moisturizer are the best I&#x27;ve found</li>
      <li>But the product itself is great.</li>
      <li>and my eyes look amazing!  </li>
      <li>Great Value and many generous gifts&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It would have to be some kind of miracle product for me to put up with that, and according to most reviews; IT&#x27;S NOT!</li>
      <li>This product is equally effective as eye revitalizers I can buy at a drugstore.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even understand if it is effective or not.</li>
      <li>Does it smell nice?</li>
      <li>Does reduce puffiness and has a nice cooling feeling to it</li>
      <li>Well worth every penny!!!</li>
      <li>It would be a pretty good product if they could just add something to it that smells good.</li>
      <li>The shipping was great, the packaging was very well.</li>
      <li>The smell either dissipates, or I become used to it a couple of minutes after application, but more than once my husband has stopped on the way to a kiss and asked me what&#x27;s on my face.      </li>
      <li>so I felt better about contacting my consultant about an exchange.</li>
      <li>I expect to get a better result than this.</li>
      <li>so it seems to be more of a hassle to use.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t buy it again for sure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile and love it.</li>
      <li>but I only smell it during and right after application, and it feels SO nice!!!  </li>
      <li>It helps with puffy eyes, goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>If it starts to burn and sting, discontinue it right away!</li>
      <li>BUT that is the only good thing.</li>
      <li>Product tremendously reduced under eye swelling!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The bags under my eyes have already been greatly reduced and the dark circles have lightened up a lot.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve use this product twice now and just don&#x27;t understand why it smells exactly like ear wax!  </li>
      <li>The smell is so strong and offensive that I havent been able to leave it on longer than ten minutes without washing it off and even then I can still smell the odor of a rotten foot for the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>The skin under my eyes was ok - just sensitive.  </li>
      <li>When a guy who&#x27;s oblivious to gym socks, a full litterbox, and burning toast notices the foul scent of my moisturizer, it&#x27;s time for a new moisturizer!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough yet to really be able to say whether it helps puffiness and dark circles, although I will say it is nice to be able to use it twice a day without it causing any issues under my makeup.</li>
      <li>Regular use keeps the circles easy to hide with concealer.      </li>
      <li>I cannot use it because of the very offensive odor.  </li>
      <li>I like the product, but the roller ball applicator doesn&#x27;t always work very well.  </li>
      <li>I expect quality from Mary Kay, and what I got was a roll on bottle with an applicator as likely to seize up as to glide smoothly over my skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a whole 48 hours</li>
      <li>This product really irritated the skin under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It is unfortunate because it is such a good product with amazing results.</li>
      <li>My husband thought our son needed new shoes when in fact it was me!</li>
      <li>I can tell just by looking at the picture this is old!!</li>
      <li>This moisturizer combines the aroma of warm orange sherbet with the funk of an athlete&#x27;s jock area after a hard workout.  </li>
      <li>But the most important complaint I have with the product is that it simply doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>It emits a strong, sour, odor</li>
      <li>I can live with the smell that others have noticed with this product.</li>
      <li>My 18 year old daughter uses them as well.</li>
      <li>Every body is different and every body reacts to certain things differently!</li>
      <li>At 33, the rest of my face looks far younger than my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I was a little hesitant about this product at first.</li>

<li> At 33, the rest of my face looks far younger than my eyes.  </li>
<li> I was a little hesitant about this product at first.</li>
<li> after the first few days, I noticed that the skin around my eyes had become a little sensitive.</li>
<li> My skin is normally not super sensitive, so</li>
<li> Maybe it&#x27;s from changing so many of my kids dirty diapers?</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t expect a long term cure but one for those emergency situations.</li>
<li> But that is minor to me.</li>
<li> Out of date products will not work, and smell bad, if you want to try this I suggest a Mary Kay consultant, yes you will pay more, but every Mary Kay product is guaranteed, with money back if you don&#x27;t like it, for any reason !!</li>
<li> And it will not smell bad if it comes from a consultant:)</li>
<li> I hate this stuff so much - what a huge waste of money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days</li>
<li> It smells as if it could give me pink eye.</li>
<li> But I am now suspicious of all of the other \\&quot;must have\\&quot; specialty items and feel like I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;had\\&quot;.</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more the mere cost of $20!!</li>
<li> I thought I received an old outdated bottle but after reviewing some of the other reviews, this is how the product smells.</li>
<li> I still had dark circles and puffy eyes, PLUS chemical burns.  </li>
<li> At least MK has a money back guarantee.</li>
<li> I have always had genetic, dark, under eye circles and was hoping this could help.</li>
<li> Another reviewer mentioned that she wastes product when she tries to get the roller ball flowing again.</li>
<li> The dark circles under my eyes didn&#x27;t disappear, but they were less noticeable in about a week.  </li>
<li> I have used Mary Kay products for a few years now, so I really enjoy their line, BUT this product smelled so bad</li>
<li> and I feel a bit like the little boy at the side of road who says \\&quot;The Emperor has no clothes\\&quot;.</li>
<li> This product was a waste of money it did noting to remove the small dark circles I have under my eyes.</li>
<li> Its a waste of money.</li>
<li> I probably wasted a quarter of the contents just rolling the tip around on something until the product started flowing again.  </li>
<li> It was a waste of my money</li>
<li> It smell like something gone bad but after reading the reviews I understood it really smells in that way.</li>
<li> After using it for the past month or so, I have yet to see ANY difference.</li>
<li> I usually just put the product on my fingers and then apply it.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
<li> I am not real happy with the product at all, ecspecially for the prices that mary k charges.</li>
<li> A couple of days later, my skin burned like crazy from saline solution when I put my contacts in.  </li>
<li> Hmm, how can I put this delicately?  </li>
<li> Like it&#x27;s soured or something.</li>
<li> and it seriously reminds me of my brothers stinky socks and shoes when we were teenagers.  </li>
<li> If I didn&#x27;t feel so bad about asking, I&#x27;d get my money back on this (and I may still do that).</li>
<li> I do however like the cooling effect it gives to tired puffy eyes</li>
<li> No matter how annoying, the technical difficulties are NOTHING compared to the smell.  </li>
<li> But the worst thing about the product is that it really, really smells bad.</li>
<li> I hope it works because it&#x27;s expensive</li>
<li> I have horrible dark circles and lids, as well as bags.  </li>
<li> I have to wash my hand after applying this product because it smells so bad.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or</li>
<li> so I can&#x27;t say whether it works or not, but I wanted to see if anyone else had anything to say about the smell or if my bottle was bad.  </li>
<li> I hate to even wear it to bed</li>
<li> As soon as I bought the product I thought it was expired because of the very disgusting smell.</li>
<li> Even if it did work, I would never buy it again because the SMELL IS SICKENING!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell. I thought I received an old outdated bottle but after reviewing some of the other reviews, this is how the product smells. My husband thought our son needed new shoes when in fact it was me!</li>
    <li> I used this product for over a 6 months. The puffiness and darkness under my eyes were not reduced. The product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but the roller ball applicator doesn&#x27;t always work very well.  I usually just put the product on my fingers and then apply it.  But the product itself is great.</li>
    <li> This product is equally effective as eye revitalizers I can buy at a drugstore.  The dark circles under my eyes didn&#x27;t disappear, but they were less noticeable in about a week.  Regular use keeps the circles easy to hide with concealer.      When this is gone, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  I expect quality from Mary Kay, and what I got was a roll on bottle with an applicator as likely to seize up as to glide smoothly over my skin.  I probably wasted a quarter of the contents just rolling the tip around on something until the product started flowing again.  Various storage methods do nothing; the roller ball cakes up with moisturizer and stops.    No matter how annoying, the technical difficulties are NOTHING compared to the smell.  Hmm, how can I put this delicately?  This moisturizer combines the aroma of warm orange sherbet with the funk of an athlete&#x27;s jock area after a hard workout.  The smell either dissipates, or I become used to it a couple of minutes after application, but more than once my husband has stopped on the way to a kiss and asked me what&#x27;s on my face.      Aaand that&#x27;s the dealbreaker.  When a guy who&#x27;s oblivious to gym socks, a full litterbox, and burning toast notices the foul scent of my moisturizer, it&#x27;s time for a new moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days so I can&#x27;t say whether it works or not, but I wanted to see if anyone else had anything to say about the smell or if my bottle was bad.  I hope it works because it&#x27;s expensive and it seriously reminds me of my brothers stinky socks and shoes when we were teenagers.  If anyone has a teenage boy they should know what I&#x27;m talking about, and that&#x27;s what this stuff smells like</li>
    <li> I cannot use it because of the very offensive odor.  I think that everyone picks up different notes so some people only smell the citrus but I cannot take it at all.  It is unfortunate because it is such a good product with amazing results.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT RECEIVE THE ITEM THAT ADVERTISED.......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this product twice now and just don&#x27;t understand why it smells exactly like ear wax!  Ear discharge. I have to wash my hand after applying this product because it smells so bad.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the results I am seeing with this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a whole 48 hours and my eyes look amazing!  I have horrible dark circles and lids, as well as bags.  At 33, the rest of my face looks far younger than my eyes.  The bags under my eyes have already been greatly reduced and the dark circles have lightened up a lot.  Yes, the product has a vitamin-ish smell but I only smell it during and right after application, and it feels SO nice!!!  Well worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I can live with the smell that others have noticed with this product. Does it smell nice? No. But that is minor to me. Another reviewer mentioned that she wastes product when she tries to get the roller ball flowing again. This has been my experience as well. Every time I use the product, I have to roll it around on the back of my hand for quite a while before any product appears. I would have preferred a different method of application. But the most important complaint I have with the product is that it simply doesn&#x27;t do anything. After using it for the past month or so, I have yet to see ANY difference. It was a waste of my money and I feel a bit like the little boy at the side of road who says \\&quot;The Emperor has no clothes\\&quot;. (If you don&#x27;t know this children&#x27;s story, please forgive me.) I&#x27;m a Mary Kay fan. Their make-up remover and moisturizer are the best I&#x27;ve found and I use them daily. My 18 year old daughter uses them as well. I also like the Timewise Body lotion. But I am now suspicious of all of the other \\&quot;must have\\&quot; specialty items and feel like I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;had\\&quot;. I&#x27;ll stick to the basics.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a week...after the first few days, I noticed that the skin around my eyes had become a little sensitive. A couple of days later, my skin burned like crazy from saline solution when I put my contacts in.  So I stopped using the eye revitalizer.  The skin under my eyes was ok - just sensitive.  But the skin where crows feet would be, had burned and blistered from this stuff.  My skin is normally not super sensitive, so I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or what...but if I could, I would give my rating zero stars.  I still had dark circles and puffy eyes, PLUS chemical burns.  At least MK has a money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those puffy eyed mornings. I didn&#x27;t expect a long term cure but one for those emergency situations. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more the mere cost of $20!!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about this product at first. I have been using it now for about three weeks and I can see the difference in my eyes.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has bags under their eyes</li>
    <li> As soon as I bought the product I thought it was expired because of the very disgusting smell. It smell like something gone bad but after reading the reviews I understood it really smells in that way. I don&#x27;t even understand if it is effective or not. I won&#x27;t buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> I can tell just by looking at the picture this is old!! Out of date products will not work, and smell bad, if you want to try this I suggest a Mary Kay consultant, yes you will pay more, but every Mary Kay product is guaranteed, with money back if you don&#x27;t like it, for any reason !! And it will not smell bad if it comes from a consultant:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile and love it. It helps with puffy eyes, goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> The shipping was great, the packaging was very well. I just didn&#x27;t like the product for me I didn&#x27;t see any improvement, but don&#x27;t let me discourage you from getting it. Every body is different and every body reacts to certain things differently!</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay products for a few years now, so I really enjoy their line, BUT this product smelled so bad, I stopped using it for fear it had expired (no lie).</li>
    <li> This product really irritated the skin under my eyes.  I am still having problems getting it cleared up.  If it starts to burn and sting, discontinue it right away!</li>
    <li> Great Value and many generous gifts&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I did not get this product from Amazon, but from a Mary Kay rep. I hate this stuff so much - what a huge waste of money. I have always had genetic, dark, under eye circles and was hoping this could help. It doesn&#x27;t help at all to reduce their apperance. Even if it did work, I would never buy it again because the SMELL IS SICKENING! It emits a strong, sour, odor and I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could stand it. Ugh. I learned my lesson - I&#x27;m just going to stick with foundation and concelor.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough yet to really be able to say whether it helps puffiness and dark circles, although I will say it is nice to be able to use it twice a day without it causing any issues under my makeup. As others have said, the roll-on applicator is wasteful. But the worst thing about the product is that it really, really smells bad. Like it&#x27;s soured or something. I hate to even wear it to bed because I know if I can smell it my boyfriend can too. It would be a pretty good product if they could just add something to it that smells good. If I didn&#x27;t feel so bad about asking, I&#x27;d get my money back on this (and I may still do that).</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of money it did noting to remove the small dark circles I have under my eyes. Its a waste of money. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Thank You</li>
    <li> It smells as if it could give me pink eye. Like rolling butthole over your eye. Yuck. It would have to be some kind of miracle product for me to put up with that, and according to most reviews; IT&#x27;S NOT! skip this spendy product.</li>
    <li> I cannot use this stuff without gagging. The smell is so strong and offensive that I havent been able to leave it on longer than ten minutes without washing it off and even then I can still smell the odor of a rotten foot for the rest of the day. I tried to add a scented oil with it to offset it but that didnt work. I do however like the cooling effect it gives to tired puffy eyes and it seems to help wake me up and get me going in the morning,  BUT that is the only good thing. The roller ball constantly clogs up and doesnt want to work properly so it seems to be more of a hassle to use. I am not real happy with the product at all, ecspecially for the prices that mary k charges. I expect to get a better result than this. I too like others who have reported here, thought that it had expired. I almost wish it had so I felt better about contacting my consultant about an exchange. Just wondering if anyone else has talk to thier consultant and what they did for them?</li>
    <li> Does reduce puffiness and has a nice cooling feeling to it but in all honesty, it smells like oil-o-dirty butt crack. I have to hold my breath putting it on! Either the smell fades after a while or I become used to the smell. Maybe it&#x27;s from changing so many of my kids dirty diapers?</li>
    <li> Product tremendously reduced under eye swelling!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to others and I will be reordering for myself&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
