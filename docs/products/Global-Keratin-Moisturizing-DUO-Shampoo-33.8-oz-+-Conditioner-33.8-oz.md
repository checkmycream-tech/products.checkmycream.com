<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best product t I have ever used. The cost of these two bottle are what one would coast at the salon.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair soft and easy :))</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two years now. I have very damaged hair, this product works fabulous. I love the way my hair looks, its softer more manageable and a bit more healthy.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky smooth</li>
    <li> Love it. Love the price</li>
    <li> Like the leave in conditioning cream I purchased, product packaging was damaged and contents leaking. I had to replace shampoo pump with an existing one I had on hand. Contents appeared watered down, and again, felt like it was used containers that had been refilled. Very unsatisfied. Will not reorder.</li>
    <li> My hair looks and feels smooth and silky using these products.  It takes out my normal frizz and leaves my hair looking and feeling very thick.  My hairdresser had given me a sample one day.  I&#x27;ve been buying the product ever since.  Only problem is that I can only find it online through Amazon.  Not in any local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Much needed if you use the taming system. Helps it last longer.</li>
    <li> thanks for good product and extremely fast shipping. amazon prime is good service, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I needed the shampoo/conditioner for colored  hair, and was uncertain in my purchase as the description and the picture differ, but was just what i needed. Does great for my hair. Fast delivery. Packaged well.</li>
    <li> I had the keratin treatment and this is the shampoo and conditioner they recommended, It smells great and keeps the keratin in my hair longer!</li>
    <li> i use keratin products for my hair and have found that this one is the best for my needs and results.</li>
    <li> Great product use it all the time.</li>
    <li> These are awesome products. My colored, damaged hair is soft and manageable. I love that they are free of laurel sulfates TEA DHA etc. I have been using this brand for about 3 years and have had no need to switch.</li>
    <li> Great product. Ordered 2nd time from here</li>
    <li> Greatest shampoo and conditioner ever!</li>
    <li> Maintains processed hair but I expected more from the conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser insists on using Global Keratin products to maintain my keratin treatment. This is absolutely the best bang for the buck for their shampoo and conditioner.  I do believe that these two products help maintain the good health of my hair.</li>
    <li> For processed hair, a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner are required to keep the shiny, healthy appearance.  This product works well and is much, much cheaper to buy online than at the salon.</li>
    <li> Both products are awesome &amp; worth every penny! It not only moisturizes your hair but makes it extremely soft. And it smells great too!</li>
    <li> great product...great price</li>
    <li> Great! Love it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I had my hair straightened at the salon with the CK product line.&lt;br /&gt;My stylus gave me complementary shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> i bought this at the recommendation of my hair stylist after she did keratin treatment to my hair. I did not realize how much I liked it until I used another shampoo for a few days, was getting frustrated at the frizz it was generating and when i went back to this product, my hair became tame again.</li>
    <li> Excellant item.. Love how my hair feels and smells when I use GK products.. Def give this item a try</li>
    <li> Good for dry and slightly damaged hair. It&#x27;s one of the only shampoo products with keratin that works for my hair - makes it super soft and I have many comments about the quality of my hair. Smells good, light scent. Excellent. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative/Things to improve: I was very disappointed with 1) The conditioner pump is defective it does not pump so I have to unscrew the lid every time and pour out some to use in the shower.  Makes it difficult to dispense in my travel bottles.  I wish I could have returned it or exchanged it but I needed to use it/wash my hair and couldn&#x27;t wait.  (It came slightly later than usual as well but that happens)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself was the same I purchased in the specialty salon I bought it in, which is reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Price slightly more expensive so reducing the price slightly would be appreciated. Keep selling more to Canada please for those who work in North America and need it on travels!!</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth product. It leaves your hair shinny and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Dont hesitate to buy it</li>
    <li> The bottles pumps don&#x27;t work so it extremely difficult to get the product out...particularly since bottle is so big &amp; heavy</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Delivery was timely</li>
    <li> amazing product. love it and works flawlessly</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner after receiving the GK Keratin treatment in salon. My hair is long and fine but I have a lot of it. First off, I would say the Keratin treatment damaged my hair terribly and after using these products a few days, my hair became impossible to comb out after showering. In addition, I began having terrible tangles that literally could not be combed through. After the Keratin and using these products, I began having serious hair loss - so much so I dreaded showering as I knew the upset would follow after seeing such a terrible loss of hair each and every time I showered. I didn&#x27;t put two and two together at this point and begin questioning the products being the problem. After all, they are touted as miracle products. Little did I know just what was happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month later, after a random stop in a different salon to purchase products, one of the stylists asked me what products I was using. She told me that my hair was EXTREMELY dry and brittle and I had 3+ inches of breakage on the right side in back. I had noticed extreme breakage on the crown area but hadn&#x27;t paid attention to the back. Once she showed me I was shocked. I had never had dry or tangly hair. Always soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched products to a different line which began putting moisture back in my hair. It has been about a week now and I am able to comb through my hair again after showering and haven&#x27;t had the big tangles I was having underneath. I no longer have broken hairs sticking straight up on the crown nor the terrible static that happened anytime I brushed. My hair has begun to look like &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; again rather than straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final way I knew these products were frying my hair was my husband used them - one time - and said he would never use them again and that I should throw them away. He has beautiful hair - never dry, very soft and styles easily. The one time use dried his hair terribly and no matter how hard he tried,it would not style.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Makes my hair feel super soft and smells good. Does make hair feel oily either.  Love love</li>
    <li> amazing shampoo and conditioner.  great for after keratin treatments.  smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> I gave it 2 starts just because the shampoo duo was not as described, it was for color hair and it did not say so in the picture description or even the name. but the delivery was fast enough and in good condition.</li>
    <li> My hair comes out absolutely gorgeous with the GKshampoo and conditioner!  It always looks  like I just came out of a salon.... healthy and shiny!</li>
    <li> This product is not the &amp;#34;real deal.&amp;#34;  I have been purchasing this Global Keratin shampoo and conditioner on Amazon..  This last time I really questioned its authenticity, so I purchased the product through my salon.  First off, the product bottle was sealed. Second, the product looked and smelled completely different.  Finally, my hair came out beautifully, looked and felt healthy!  I would not recommend buying this product on Amazon, and be careful!</li>
    <li> this leaves my hair super clean &amp; silky smooth. The shampoo is strong so be patient but that conditioner is the bomb!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> great product - fast delivery</li>
    <li> Amazing results so far. Been using for about 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> Great product even though I purchased the wrong one it&#x27;s still great  this one is for color treated hair., but I don&#x27;t put color in my hair but overall it&#x27;s a great product I would recommend  that if you use the GK KERATIN. TREAMENT USE THE THE GLOBAL KERATIN  SHAMPOO AND CONDITI ONES MAKE SURE YOU PICK THE RIGHT ONE AL, ARE GOOD BUT IF YOU PUT COLOR IN YOUR HAIR THIS ONE IS GREAT FOR YOU</li>
    <li> Got the keratin treatment done on my hair, and was then recommended these shampoos to keep it as long as possible for the aftercare. Just amazing. They smell interestingly nice too, not aromatic or anything but still. Also, great deal for the price/size.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!!...I&#x27;m due for a Keratin treatment this week..I was really hating my hair..It felt really dry and frizzy. After one use it was like night and day!!.I didn&#x27;t use this shampoo during this last Keratin treatment and my Keratin treatment didn&#x27;t last nearly as long...I did use name brand sulfate free shampoo and conditioner from Paul Mitchell and Morrocan oil...I really feel like this particular product made a huge difference last time on the keratin treatment...Just one use with this product and desperately needing another keratin treatment made me have a great hair day. It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down  . Just nice a smooth and frizz free. I&#x27;m also using Morrocan oil in my hair but I was also using that before with other shampoo and conditioner... This shampoo and conditioner made a huge difference.... I will definitely be stocking up on this...It&#x27;s my must have to predictable hair !!</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo/conditioner I will use. Great price on Amazon! Always arrives wrapped in extra plastic too in case any leaks. You never know with these types of products. Once in a while I get one that leaks a little but usually all is good! Just a great product.</li>
    <li> I somewhat recently got another Keratin treatment done to my hair.  The first set of shampoo/conditioner I got from my hairdresser dried my hair out horribly and made my hair break and fall out.&lt;br /&gt;This however has helped my hair tremendously.  I think the treatment itself dried out my hair as it is still a tad dry, but this shampoo/conditioner has repaied all the damage my old shampoo had done.  And it smells pretty good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has lasted me a while, as you don&#x27;t need much of each, a small amount goes a long way.  And the pump is a great convenience as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definately be buying more of these when my current one runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GK line itself has been somewhat of a hair saver in general.  I am using a couple of their products and they have helped as well.  I recommend this brand if you have had a keratin treatment.</li>
    <li> my hair is super fine (&amp; i have a lot of it) so this product didn&#x27;t work that great with my hair</li>
    <li> Great product and great size.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner.  It is really hard to find shampoo and conditioner for my hair - thick, colored, and a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this, makes your hair really shiny and moisturized. Now I can stop looking for shampoo and conditioner, there are so many out there but this one is really good.</li>
    <li> Size of products were above my expectations.  The packaging was great avoiding any spillage.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the product.  thank you.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner is an amazing duo. I have very fine and very processed hair. I love how the two make my hair feel very soft and the scent is very nice. Can&#x27;t beat the price, either! Paid more than double at the salon!</li>
    <li> Nice product, used it for a year, would buy again when I will have my next keratin treatment</li>
    <li> Really great price plus delivery straight to my door.Oh yeah, the shampoo and conditioner is the best.</li>
    <li> In the salon these would cost double.  When you have Keratin treatments, you have to use sulfite and sodium free hair products.  This fits the bill and I like the texture and smell.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love the way it makes my hair feel and that it doesn&#x27;t damage my colour. Smells good, too.</li>
    <li> Works great! Affordable and quick easy delivery.</li>
    <li> Love this shampo &amp; conditioner.  My hair is in best shape ever!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> It smells great, and my hair is definitely more manageable since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo arrived leaking shampoo.  The conditioner was in excellent shape.</li>
    <li> It was deliverd head of scheduled date. It is perfect size and price.</li>
    <li> After I  had the GK treatment, I  had trouble tracking down this shampoo and conditioner. My salon seemed to always be out of it. I am so happy to find these products - they are GIANT and will finally last me much longer!</li>
    <li> Came super quick....love this</li>
    <li> Yes! I absolutely loved it. I&#x27;m glad my daughter convinced me to try Amazon...</li>
    <li> I have seen such a difference in my hair shine and strength since using this product. Great stuff, smells wonderful!</li>
