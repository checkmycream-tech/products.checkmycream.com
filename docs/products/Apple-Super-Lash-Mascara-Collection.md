      <li>It smells really great and goes on so smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Love it, make my eyelashes  grow and stay healthy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so sure how I feel about the smell, but the scent fades after about 15 minutes</li>
      <li>Ok, so I have been a rogue mascara buyer all my life.</li>
      <li>Try it, you will Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always testing out different mascaras and this is the best one yet.</li>
      <li>I love it..</li>
      <li>I ordered another two for my mother and I since I loved it so much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not water prove but it never smears and it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a huge array or brands and have never been a repeat customer of any of them, until I found Apple.</li>
      <li>Fantastic brush</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s cheap to boot.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and for the price, I can afford to replace it more frequently!</li>

      <li>The wand is HUGE, which I really like!</li>
      <li>Would love to be able to just get a new, fresh, NORMAL sized brush.  </li>
      <li>: it holds a beautiful curl, creates even fluttery lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump, is black, and dries fast.  </li>
      <li>is the very large brush size.  </li>
      <li>I know some people complain that the brush is too big, and while I agree it&#x27;s an unusual size, it gets nice results</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I really like the mascara!</li>
      <li>I first read about this product in a review of cosmetics.</li>
      <li>I love the big brush!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been right under my nose the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not so much when you try to wash it off though.</li>
      <li>(However it should be noted that I have huge Bambi eyes and naturally long lashes</li>
      <li>It leaves your lashes very long and full.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe I live so close to Mexico</li>
      <li>and I just keep switching it when I get a new tube of mascara.  </li>
      <li>Let me explain because I found this confusing when I was reading reviews: these mascaras are SCENTED like magic markers.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I still have a regular sized brush from a previous bottle</li>
      <li>I ordered Mamey, which is apparently supposed to smell like apples.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of whimsical concept, and I&#x27;m looking forward to repeat purchases just to experiment with the different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The brush is HUGE and very hard to apply mascara.</li>
      <li>I may finally be ready to settle down!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or super sticky like other mascara.</li>

<li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or super sticky like other mascara.</li>

<li> Make it look like my lashes are long</li>
<li> some of them seems to be dry then others ..</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s really not a deal breaker.</li>
<li> I definitely recommend it for those who like thick long lashes.</li>
<li> so I have room to maneuver; if your eyes are small or you have short lashes</li>
<li> The only negative</li>
<li> (and it&#x27;s a big negative)</li>
<li> I have no clue why they changed the brush size a few years ago.  </li>
<li> Well, that may be but the product seemed dried out to me.</li>
<li> waste of money.</li>
<li> dried out.</li>
<li> Too clumpy and the texture is not smooth leaving clumps!!</li>
<li> It makes if very difficult to apply the mascara properly.  </li>
<li> It burned my eyes, smells TERRIBLE, is really dry, and doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for your lashes other then make them stick to each other.</li>
<li> All of these things are not attractive qualities in a mascara.</li>
<li> This mascara is one of the very few that keep my eyelashes curled!!</li>
<li> Sad.</li>
<li> This is why I purchased the wrong item.</li>
<li> horrible seller</li>
<li> the brush is awful ..smells like apple but nothing that i cant get from cvs</li>
<li> this is the WORST mascara I have ever tried.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the mascara! Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or super sticky like other mascara. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> the brush is awful ..smells like apple but nothing that i cant get from cvs</li>
    <li> I first read about this product in a review of cosmetics. The article said this was a great buy. Well, that may be but the product seemed dried out to me. It was sticky and gooey. It didn&#x27;t apply to my lashes well. I won&#x27;t be using it after all.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have been a rogue mascara buyer all my life. I&#x27;ve tried a huge array or brands and have never been a repeat customer of any of them, until I found Apple. I may finally be ready to settle down! Cute packaging, excellent formula, and it&#x27;s cheap to boot. I can&#x27;t believe I live so close to Mexico and it&#x27;s been right under my nose the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the deal with the formula: it holds a beautiful curl, creates even fluttery lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump, is black, and dries fast.  I know some people complain that the brush is too big, and while I agree it&#x27;s an unusual size, it gets nice results so I&#x27;m not complaining. (However it should be noted that I have huge Bambi eyes and naturally long lashes so I have room to maneuver; if your eyes are small or you have short lashes I could see this brush being challenging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s going on with the flavors?! Let me explain because I found this confusing when I was reading reviews: these mascaras are SCENTED like magic markers. I ordered Mamey, which is apparently supposed to smell like apples. I&#x27;m not so sure how I feel about the smell, but the scent fades after about 15 minutes so it&#x27;s really not a deal breaker. It&#x27;s kind of whimsical concept, and I&#x27;m looking forward to repeat purchases just to experiment with the different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Did not receive the item I was hoping for. I remember using this product back in my teenage years when I used to travel to Mexico with my father. This is where I would find the product. A good idea would be to put a picture of the brush the mascara has. This is why I purchased the wrong item.</li>
    <li> The mascara itself is awesome! It leaves your lashes very long and full.  The only negative (and it&#x27;s a big negative) is the very large brush size.  It makes if very difficult to apply the mascara properly.  I have no clue why they changed the brush size a few years ago.  Luckily, I still have a regular sized brush from a previous bottle and I just keep switching it when I get a new tube of mascara.  Would love to be able to just get a new, fresh, NORMAL sized brush.  Please change it back!</li>
    <li> It gets all over your eyes because of the weird applicator but comes off easily when you do. Not so much when you try to wash it off though. But no flakes really which is a huge improvement over most.</li>
    <li> The brush is HUGE and very hard to apply mascara. Too clumpy and the texture is not smooth leaving clumps!!</li>
    <li> is a great product, do ..some of them seems to be dry then others .. hope my next order will be the way they should..</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! This mascara is one of the very few that keep my eyelashes curled!! Some buyers complaint is too dry, but really that is what helps women like me that can&#x27;t wear mascaras that are too liquid/wet! I love this mascara and for the price, I can afford to replace it more frequently!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this mascara !!! It made my eyelashes look like extensions ! I love the big brush! It&#x27;s not water prove but it never smears and it&#x27;s easy to remove. I ordered another two for my mother and I since I loved it so much. I&#x27;m always testing out different mascaras and this is the best one yet. I definitely recommend it for those who like thick long lashes.</li>
    <li> I give superlash apple mascara 5 stars but I&#x27;m rating this one 1 star because I did not receive the mascara shown in the picture or product description. Sad.</li>

    <li> this is the WORST mascara I have ever tried. It burned my eyes, smells TERRIBLE, is really dry, and doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for your lashes other then make them stick to each other. All of these things are not attractive qualities in a mascara.</li>
