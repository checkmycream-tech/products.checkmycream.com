    <li> This has a very mild, inoffensive fragrance. I can&#x27;t say that it really reminds me of musk, but I like it anyway. It is subtle enough that it doesn&#x27;t hang around too long after I use it, which is a plus in these times when so many people are sensitive to fragrances. The fragrance blends very well with the Alyssa Ashley Musk Body Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;1)  I have small hands and very mild arthritis in my thumb joints. The bottle is large and made of sturdy plastic, to the point where it is quite difficult to squeeze the gel out of the bottle. I have found that I am going to need to purchase a small plastic bottle and transfer the gel into it so that I can more easily dispense it when I am in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;2) I have soft water, and the gel makes the tub floor a bit slippery, so bear that in mind when you are using it.</li>
    <li> My favorite since the1960&#x27;s..</li>
    <li> As remembered.  Also ordered the lotion.  Thank you for carrying this!</li>
    <li> wonderful smell, wish I could buy a case, great service to</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I found finally found this fragrance again! Love this! Really thought they didn&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> wish it could be bought in stores but I will continue to order it  love all the products  of the Musk</li>
    <li> I  love this shower gel. I feels good, it smells good and I had a hard time after years to find it but Amazon came through for me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scented body wash. A very nice scent that is not too strong. Perfect for the shower!</li>
    <li> Great shower gel. I bought this for my mother in law. It is her favorite. The scent is very feminine and light. Can&#x27;t wait to give it on Christmas.</li>
    <li> Stinks horribly!!  Horrible smell and extremely powerful!!  Really gross!!</li>
    <li> Alyssa Ashley Musk has always been my favorite fragrance, the shower gel has a great scent and this product can be used as a bubble bath or shower gel. Leaves a gentle fragrance on your skin and is non drying.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like musk at all.</li>
    <li> Nothing much to say except I love this scent.  It is a really nice musk fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love it as I do the lotion and have been using for many, many years.  I forgot to order perfume spray last time however,  Will have to wait until next time.  Did you ever have a vanilla musk?</li>
    <li> Hey, it&#x27;s what she had back in the day.  Eleven more words required in the review???  Ridiculous and then some. .</li>
    <li> the bath jel wears well and mixes with the body chemistry creating a fresh fragrance. it is very soft fragrance that appeals to most senses.</li>
    <li> great... only wish the Alyssa Ashley musk perfume was still in production...the stuff I have ordered lately is old and missing some of it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
    <li> Will not buy this again. Has absolutely no scent.  Don&#x27;t know how they can call it &amp;#34;musk&amp;#34;.  Was truly disappointed</li>
    <li> lathers very well just hard to get out of that big of a bottle wish it had a pump on it.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells</li>
    <li> The purest musk I know is made by Alyssa Ashley, and it is not easy to find.  I was delighted to see it available on Amazon so of course I bought all three products--perfume oil, lotion, and shower gel.  This gel is rich and very fragrant but not overly so.  It is perfect as &amp;#34;Step 1&amp;#34; when the musk is used in a trio.  It was delivered before the promised time and in great condition.  I recommend Alyssa Ashley musk products to anyone who wants a true yet subtle musk scent.  My absolute favorite!</li>
    <li> I love the scent...I&#x27;ve given this product to both female &amp; male relatives...and I keep it for myself as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent... i just love it, i wish i could buy many at once and be sent to Angola..</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way my skin feels.</li>
    <li> I have used this musk for years.  I had great difficulty getting it in the stores and am so happy that Amazon carries it.  I love the way it smells on me and the way it makes me feel.</li>
    <li> I first found this musk bath wash in walmart and simply was impressed with the product. It was then discontinued. I was so excited to see that it was available here on amazon, that I purchased two bottles. I would encourage anyone who likes the smell of musk and soft skin to purchase this product... It is the best that I have found on the market!!</li>
    <li> I love this product...I wish I could limit it to just me...I don&#x27;t want anyone else to sell like me...I know that is selfish but that is how much I love this product...</li>
    <li> Wonderful product delivered in excellent condition, as usual, by Amazon ~ and at a good price!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these products for years. Now that I&#x27;ve found where I can purchase them I will be refilling my order when I run out.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent!! When I shower with this body wash someone always compliments me on it. I love it so much!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and would buy it again.  Great Seller also! A+++++++</li>
    <li> What can I say? I had no idea this fragrance was still being made. It still smells heavenly in the shower, I just love it. Plus the price is extremely reasonable. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
