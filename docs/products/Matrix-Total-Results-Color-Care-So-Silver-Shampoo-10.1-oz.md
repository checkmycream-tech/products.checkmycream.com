      <li>I was so scared to apply this shampoo, but I just did and I am extremely happy.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is great-</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>so it isn&#x27;t all that great</li>
      <li>I rinsed in very warm water, shampooed it in, and let it stay on about 4 minutes before rinsing.  </li>
      <li>All in all I am so happy I tried this!  :)</li>

      <li>This is a great product for silver hair and very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It has also given me a purple hue to the more silver areas.  </li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>I was looking at shampoos that cost much more and decided to give this one a try.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for about two years and love it.  </li>

      <li>But I love it.</li>
      <li>Best suited for light blondes and mature women with gray or silver/white hair.</li>
      <li>This was perfect for my blonde locks!</li>
      <li>I have tried many purple shampoos and this is one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This is the best product for grey hair!  </li>
      <li>I was really hopeful because the reviews were good, but I guess it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>One wash my orange highlights turned beautiful blonde.</li>
      <li>I can coat my hair and leave on for 1 minute and it tones my blonde beautifully.</li>
      <li>and this Matrix is what I believe causes people to actually stop me on the street and comment on what beautiful hair color I have.</li>
      <li>No more, now it&#x27;s bright and shiny and I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
      <li>This type of shampoo is ideal for those who look good in cool tones, with naturally ash colored hair (whether blonde or grayed/</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny :-)</li>
      <li>Great shampoo for white hair</li>
      <li>I saw a big difference in just one use and after two my hair looks great, i am ordering another bottle now</li>
      <li>I highlight my hair and tend to pull very warm tones, so I am constantly battling brassiness.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s perfect, keeps my hair a cooler more platinum tone and brightens up the blonde instantly.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hasband&#x27;s hair clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>and I feel like I have to use a lot for it to really clean my hair.</li>
      <li>Excellent shampoo to rid natural blonde hair of toxins that make it appear brassy</li>
      <li>I saw this in a magazine, so I tried it and it does make your hair feel very soft, shinny &amp; takes away the off tones, leaving just a nice shine.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my white hair looking bright.</li>
      <li>I bought this for a family member who has a full head of white/gray hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also tried Paul Mitchell&#x27;s toning shampoo that also deposits purple, but I much prefer the So Silver by Matrix as I felt it was a little more effective and didn&#x27;t leave my hair quite as dry feeling (still, use a good conditioner after washing with this!)</li>
      <li>Took away my brassy hue from bleaching at home, and made my hair gorgeously blonde just like I&#x27;d been at the hairdresser :) YAY!</li>
      <li>Also, So Silver did not stain my blond &amp; scalp the inky hue of blue/purple that Shimmer Lights did (both products were left in for two minutes &amp; then rinsed out), and finally (most importantly to me)</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair nice and white.  </li>
      <li>It just helps blondes &amp; gray/silvers look more natural and appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different purple shampoos including organic ones but this one tops the list.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says it does and leaves your hair shiny and manageable.</li>
      <li>Only use it every few times you wash your hair, alternating with a color care shampoo (I love Pureology) and a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING DIRECTIONS SHOULD FIRST BE MADE.</li>
      <li>Only use it every few times you wash your hair, alternating with a color care shampoo (I love Pureology) and a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>use: Wearing suitable gloves, apply to wet hair... &amp;#34; [whoever heard of needing to wear gloves to wash your hair?!?]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;CAUTION: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS INGREDIENTS WHICH MAY CAUSE SKIN IRRITATION ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND A PRELIMINARY TEST</li>
      <li>Not super amazing though.</li>
      <li>It was generally a little too warm for my taste.</li>
      <li>This product is great for highlighted hair that tends to turn a little yellow/gold rather than stay blonde.  </li>
      <li>Best product for blonde hair that maybe a little too yellow.</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m a level 11 (very light blonde) and it looked too yellow for my tastes before I used So Silver on it.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is just enough to tone lightly, nothing too</li>
      <li>I really like it and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>Thanks Matrix.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest this product!</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It is drying (not so much as the Shimmer Lights though)</li>
      <li>It made it so much lighter without damaging it so much.</li>
      <li>I change my blonde somewhat often, but whenever I decide to go light again (platinum or near-platinum)</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>I had swelling from my eyelids all the way down to the top of my cheek bones.</li>
      <li>After two bleaches in less than three days, and with the hair over processed, I ended up with a color I really love.  </li>
      <li>but - the ends had become brassy (as they retain some of the older, permanent color.  </li>
      <li>This seems to be a decent shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super concentrated, so I miss it with my regular shampoo, every day.</li>
      <li>I have all over platinum high lights</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo.  Does exactly what it says it does and leaves your hair shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I decided to order this product and give it a try after reading many positive reviews on it, after I had already tried Clairol&#x27;s Shimmer Lights purple shampoo and hated the latter! Both products cost about the same $ and worked to reduce the brassiness in my bleached hair, however, Matrix So Silver smelled awesome (where as Shimmer Lights smells nasty &amp; holds the smell even after applying a deep conditioning hair mask). Also, So Silver did not stain my blond &amp; scalp the inky hue of blue/purple that Shimmer Lights did (both products were left in for two minutes &amp; then rinsed out), and finally (most importantly to me) the So Silver did NOT dry &amp; frizz out my hair half as bad as Shimmer Lights did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final review after using this product three times in two weeks: I simply LOVE it! It has rid ALL the yellow/brassiness out of my dyed blond hair (I am originally a dark brunette) and I really like how it smells. It is drying (not so much as the Shimmer Lights though) so on the washes that I use it I follow with a two minute deep conditioner. All in all I am so happy I tried this!  :)</li>
    <li> I first learned about this product back in beauty school when I was a student. Now, as a cosmetologist, I not only recommend this product but I&#x27;ve used it for several years myself. I change my blonde somewhat often, but whenever I decide to go light again (platinum or near-platinum) I always fall back on this shampoo for help. I&#x27;ve also seen what it can do for mature women with gray/white hair. This type of shampoo is ideal for those who look good in cool tones, with naturally ash colored hair (whether blonde or grayed/silver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works like a toner, it deposits some purple to your hair which can cut yellow, brassy tones. This works great as the finishing touch whenever I bleach or color my hair light. Right now I&#x27;m a level 11 (very light blonde) and it looked too yellow for my tastes before I used So Silver on it. It literally does the same for those with gray/white hair, when the hair has a yellow tone you can use this shampoo to cut the yellow/brassiness and deposit some cool tones. It just helps blondes &amp; gray/silvers look more natural and appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice would be to rinse your hair in hot water before applying this shampoo (hot water causes the hair shaft to expand, which will allow for better depositing of the toner), apply liberally, and allow it to stay there for several minutes before rinsing in water as cold as you can stand it (cold water will cause the hair shaft to contract again, which will leave it stronger, better protected, and help keep the toner \\&quot;in\\&quot; your hair longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the color scare you! This shampoo is DARK purple. You will be worried you are going to end up with royal purple hair after using it. But it won&#x27;t deposit enough color to make your hair purple, it will be just enough to help tone your hair. Just note, if you have too much brassiness, you probably will need a color correction done by a professional. This shampoo is just enough to tone lightly, nothing too drastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would not recommend using this shampoo at every wash. Only use it every few times you wash your hair, alternating with a color care shampoo (I love Pureology) and a good conditioner. It wouldn&#x27;t be good for your hair to use this type of shampoo too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used correctly, this shampoo is a great alternative to corrective color jobs, it&#x27;s perfect for those looking to tone down the yellow/gold in their hair. Best suited for light blondes and mature women with gray or silver/white hair. Matrix is a great brand in the hair industry, and this is a fine product.

    <li> I was so scared to apply this shampoo, but I just did and I am extremely happy.  From ugly yellow with some brass, I went to a beautiful Pale Blond.  I am hispanic, very dark color hair, but with a lot of gray roots.  I have paid so much money on highlights, and I was never happy with the colors.  I highly recommend this product.  After two bleaches in less than three days, and with the hair over processed, I ended up with a color I really love.  Thanks Matrix.</li>
    <li> I have sections of my hair which are very white now and this Matrix is what I believe causes people to actually stop me on the street and comment on what beautiful hair color I have. No yellow in my hair!</li>
    <li> This product was a lifesaver! I am Indian and have really dark, course hair. I recently highlighted it, but ended up with orange/brass hair. I was so bummed, that I was about to just return to my black hair. But then I used this shampoo and it was almost all gone in just one use! Because my hair is thicker, I left the product in for ten minutes. But it completely changed the look of my hair! I have gotten so many compliments! I highly suggest this product! I gave a 4 star instead of a 5 because it did leave my hair a little dry after. But this shampoo isn&#x27;t supposed to be used every wash. Only once a week. But I will definitely keep using!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for grey hair!  Takes the yellow out and does not make it &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34;! You will love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a family member who has a full head of white/gray hair.  Matrix is the only silver shampoo that actually keeps her hair from turning yellow.</li>
    <li> Not all purple shampoos are created equally. I highlight my hair and tend to pull very warm tones, so I am constantly battling brassiness. I have tried many purple shampoos and this is one of my favorites. I can coat my hair and leave on for 1 minute and it tones my blonde beautifully. I use approximately once a week. Sometimes if I feel like I need a tone in between I will apply a small amount to my daily shampoo and mix it. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I am trying to get my hair silver and black and even the salon dye jobs dont turn my hair silver like this does! Start to notice results in days! Love it!</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my blonde locks! It made it so much lighter without damaging it so much. You can only use it every other month or else your hair gets dried out. But I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair product for 20+ yrs and love it!  Takes the purple out of my gorgeous silver hair :)</li>
    <li> I boutght this product expecting to reduce the yellow tone on my hightlights, but I´m very disappointed because the product does not work as promissed. The only difference I noted after using this produtc is that my hair became very, very dry and without shine. The yellow tone remained on my hair as the same. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great- it smells nice after washing and has kept my color from turning brassy (although, I am a natural blonde and just went blonder). The one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it does not lather and I feel like I have to use a lot for it to really clean my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great for highlighted hair that tends to turn a little yellow/gold rather than stay blonde.  I saw a big difference in just one use and after two my hair looks great, i am ordering another bottle now</li>
    <li> Matrix total uses a different soaping agent than 99.9% of all other shampoos. If you have trouble with thinning hair, this may help you because the normal soaping agent (sodium laural sulphate) is known to cause scalp and hair problems. It takes a while to get the yellow out of grey hair but this shampoo really brightens grey hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo helped to get rid of the brassy look of my highlights. So glad I bought this product. Glad I read the reviews. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without the reviews on this website. This shampoo gave my highlights the boost they needed. I use it 2 days in a row every couple weeks, just to give my highlights a brighter, non-brassy look. At least I don&#x27;t need to use too often.</li>
    <li> Best product for blonde hair that maybe a little too yellow. Helps cancel out yellow brassy tones. Use once to twice a week. After you see results back off to once every two weeks or gray tint will appear.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for white hair</li>
    <li> I used this for quite awhile and didn&#x27;t see that it was diminishing the yellowing of my gray hair so I switched to Clairol Shimmers and think it is a superior product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo took the yellow out of my white hair and made it silvery and shiny.  I absolutely love this shampoo.  I have tried many different purple shampoos including organic ones but this one tops the list.  I will continue to buy this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Step 1: Look for reviews on shampoos for greying hair.  Step 2: Find shampoo with good reviews, and buy from Amazon.  Step 3:  Apply shampoo in shower.  Step 4: In idle curiosity, read directions on shampoo bottle.  Step 5: FREAK OUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why, you might wonder?  Here&#x27;s what the bottle directions say.  The ALL CAPS are as written on the bottle-- it&#x27;s not me adding them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;To use: Wearing suitable gloves, apply to wet hair... &amp;#34; [whoever heard of needing to wear gloves to wash your hair?!?]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;CAUTION: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS INGREDIENTS WHICH MAY CAUSE SKIN IRRITATION ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND A PRELIMINARY TEST ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING DIRECTIONS SHOULD FIRST BE MADE. THIS PRODUCT MUST NOT BE USED FOR DYEING THE EYELASHES OR EYEBROWS; TO DO SO MAY CAUSE BLINDNESS. AVOID CONTACT WITH THE EYES AND SKIN (OTHER THAN AREAS OF APPLICATION) ... WEAR DISPOSABLE GLOVES WHEN APPLYING. WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY AFTER USE. ... PERFORM THE FOLLOWING ALLERGY TEST *48 HOURS* [that bit is even underlined] BEFORE EACH USE OF THIS PRODUCT, AS ALLERGIES CAN DEVELOP SUDDENLY, EVEN THOUGH YOU OR YOUR CLIENT HAS PREVIOUSLY USED A HAIRCOLOR PRODUCT FROM THIS BRAND OR ANOTHER.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this point, the directions explain how to perform the skin allergy test.  Then:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;you/your client SHOULD NOT USE THIS PRODUCT OR ANY OTHER HAIRCOLOR UNTIL AFTER CONSULTING A DOCTOR&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, I think you lost me after the &amp;#34;wearing gloves&amp;#34; bit.  The need to consult a doctor in order to wash my hair, the non-stop allergy testing, and-- oh yes, the going blind if I get the product in my eyes-- those are just the cherry on top.  I&#x27;m gone.</li>
    <li> I did highlights on my medium brown/light brown hair with naturetint hair dye, which has no ammonia but I believe it contains PPD so it isn&#x27;t all that great but my hair turned out a bit brassy. It was generally a little too warm for my taste. I thought this product would be exactly what I needed since it claimed to solve this particular problem, but it did not do much except dry my hair a little. I even did a test round where I only used it on a section of my hair to see the difference clearly against other sections and it may have slightly brightened it, very, very, slightly, but not much else. It definitely did not remove any warmth, brassiness, or even ugly yellow/orange tones at all from my hair. I was really hopeful because the reviews were good, but I guess it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, brightens my gray/silver hair.</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like a dog dipped for fleas, go ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tired of these coal-based phony, strong and possibly making one sick scents they put in everything now a-days.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about two years and love it.  It keeps my hair nice and white.  It does not get the blue look which has happened with similar shampoos.</li>
    <li> Took away my brassy hue from bleaching at home, and made my hair gorgeously blonde just like I&#x27;d been at the hairdresser :) YAY!</li>
    <li> One wash my orange highlights turned beautiful blonde. I&#x27;ve used so many in the past only to be disappointed this stuff rocks. I will be faithful forever&amp;#62; LOL</li>
    <li> I have gray hair and had low lights put in. The stylist left the dye in too long and left me with black streaks in odd places. I needed to brighten the gray that was left. This shampoo does the job. It keeps my hair looking silvery rather than dull and as my hair has grown and haircuts have helped to remove the low lights, this product has enhanced the natural color. The shampoo isn&#x27;t heavy and gives my hair body and softness.</li>
    <li> Brassy tones of bleached hair were gone after 2 washes!</li>
    <li> I guess it works? I see a small difference when I use it so I guess it works. Not super amazing though. But I&#x27;d buy it again to keep the brass away.</li>
    <li> I am the person who buys the .99¢ shampoo, cause all shampoo&#x27;s are the same. Then I splurged and bought So Silver...and...I could tell the difference in the first shampoo, with every shampoo my brassy blonde is fading from my salt &amp; pepper gray hair. Not only does it work for fading out the yellow, but it makes your hair shiny, soft, and fragrant! It&#x27;s worth every penny :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years to keep my white hair from yellowing.  It works really well and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a decent shampoo.  I bought it for the blond in my hair...it is supposed to tone it down or take away brassiness?  It seems to do what it claims.</li>
    <li> Not only did this shampoo brighten my hair, but it makes it smoother and doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all. I did use a conditioner. I would definitely try this shampoo if you are looking for something to brighten up your dull gray hair.</li>
    <li> Use this shampoo all the time to keep my white hair from looking yellow.  Have used it for years and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> n  I use this product three times a week along with shampoo for my gray hair (male). It&#x27;s given my hair a healthier and darker appearance.&lt;br /&gt;It never looks purplish and the product only requires a small amount for a good result. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for about 10 years.  I love it.</li>
    <li> great ,and smell good</li>
    <li> I was looking at shampoos that cost much more and decided to give this one a try.  I love it!  It keeps my white hair looking bright.</li>
    <li> I just recently dyed my hair blonde. This product was recommended to me. While it does keep the yellow at bay, i had a very bad allergic reaction. My eyes swelled up this morning (after using yesterday). I had swelling from my eyelids all the way down to the top of my cheek bones. My eyes wouldn&#x27;t stop watering and almost 14 hours later it still looks like I got hit in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Please be careful when using this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo to rid natural blonde hair of toxins that make it appear brassy</li>
    <li> I use this product a few days after I get my hair bleached. It really helps with cutting out the yellow. I took before and after picture and with in 3 days of heavy use. I was platinum blonde. I would recommend using gloves if you have nails. It gets under them and it&#x27;s hard to get the purple out. Other than that it does exactly what I wanted it too.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hasband&#x27;s hair clean and shiny. Removes yellow undertones from the gray hair. My husband had some buil up from other products and this shampoo cleaned it all away</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years; having white/silvery hair.  It removes any yellow.  It&#x27;s super concentrated, so I miss it with my regular shampoo, every day.</li>
    <li> This is a good product; does add some shine to the gray!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone with gray or salt and pepper colored hair.</li>
    <li> Good product!  My hair is about 75% white and I last colored it about a year ago with the palest blonde shade available. Since then it has not needed coloring as the roots blend so well - but - the ends had become brassy (as they retain some of the older, permanent color.  This product, after one use, has made this more subtle, and with continued use, should tone it down even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a small bottle but you don&#x27;t need a lot of shampoo - even for my shoulder length, thick hair.  I rinsed in very warm water, shampooed it in, and let it stay on about 4 minutes before rinsing.  Remember my hair color motto. When you are absolutely sure all the product is rinsed out, continue rinsing for another minute!  If you don&#x27;t rinse it all, you will have purple/blue left in your hair - and I don&#x27;t want that.</li>
    <li> I saw this in a magazine, so I tried it and it does make your hair feel very soft, shinny &amp; takes away the off tones, leaving just a nice shine.  Glad I tried it, will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have all over platinum high lights and this makes my hair brighter and shiner. I use about once a week and leave on for about 2 minutes. Smells nice. This is the only purple shampoo I have tried. I really like it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Love everything about it! Leaves my hair soft and smelling great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other blue shampoos to keep the brassy yellow tone out of my blonde hair, and none work as well as this one does. I use it once a week and it&#x27;s perfect, keeps my hair a cooler more platinum tone and brightens up the blonde instantly.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is thick and rich with a very faint nice smell. I wash my hair first with a medicated shampoo, and then only a small amount of this is needed for a lush headful of suds. My hair is mostly gray and brown, with a lot of white around my face which was looking dull and yellowish. No more, now it&#x27;s bright and shiny and I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for silver hair and very reasonably priced. I use it once a week to remove any build up of styling products.</li>
    <li> starting to get dandruff and problem in eye lids&lt;br /&gt;this took it away&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t know why - lady who cuts my hair suggested it!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  It has given my gray a new silver shine.  It has also given me a purple hue to the more silver areas.  I have recommended this shampoo to others that have asked me how I keep my hair so nice and shiny.</li>
