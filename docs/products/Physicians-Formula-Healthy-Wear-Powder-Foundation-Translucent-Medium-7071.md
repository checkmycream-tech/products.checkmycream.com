      <li>I used it on his face, chest, and shoulders and hoped for the best.  </li>
      <li>Perfect combo.</li>
      <li>Im impressed with the sub protection</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>So if you love this product stock up!!!  </li>
      <li>The great thing i love about this product is that it has SPF 50!!!</li>
      <li>It is great.  </li>
      <li>The Physicians Formula SPF 50 is simply amazing and the Protection AND Coverage you get is superb!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Physician&#x27;s Formula, and have been told that it&#x27;s the best drugstore makeup around.  </li>
      <li>Great SPF to protect your skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought it twice, while I am happy about its SPF, I am not so fond about how it works as a powder foundation.</li>
      <li>Great purchase?</li>
      <li>This product is great.</li>
      <li>Great coverage, doesn&#x27;t make me break out or anything.</li>
      <li>All in all this is a good powder with great coverage, but isn&#x27;t ideal for touch ups throughout the day, which isn&#x27;t great because SPF has to be reapplied to maintain protection.</li>
      <li>This is a great powder.</li>
      <li>and it has a very nice texture.  </li>
      <li>Amazing!  </li>
      <li>and it is fair.  </li>
      <li>good product.  </li>
      <li>She is fair skin</li>
      <li>Stays on well and absorbs a good amount of oil, at the end of the day it does get shiny on me</li>
      <li>You can use it by itself instead of with foundation and for summer or excercise it has good coverage.  </li>
      <li>It is good that they have a bronzer version of this as well, which i use for the summer.</li>
      <li>Good quality make</li>
      <li>I am very fair and most makeup goes either too orange or too rose.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t easily look caked or unnatural the way many SPF powder foundations do  Leaves skin looking flawless   </li>
      <li>I love this!  </li>
      <li>Still I love it!</li>
      <li>However, it turns out it is a great light coverage that evens my skin out a bit and doesn&#x27;t make me look cakey or made-up.  </li>
      <li>It provides nice even coverage, it blurs pores, covers blemishes, hides under eye shadows.</li>
      <li>This leaves me nice and matte.</li>
      <li>Works as a sunscreen which is nice.  </li>
      <li>it is nice to boost the spf with something that will help absorb.</li>
      <li>He is fair skinned like me and burns fairly easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Clinique and Body Shop Pressed Foundation and this is by FAR the best and SPF50!</li>
      <li>Smooth  Good coverage  </li>
      <li>The power foundation was just too light to do much good.</li>
      <li>The color is good for my light olive skin.  </li>
      <li>but it also is a superior cosmetic product, giving my skin a smooth, porcelain like finish.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best yet,  </li>
      <li>It comes off into very very fine pieces.  </li>
      <li>It would be much better if they had a legitimately translucent version of this product for touch ups.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I found it online :)</li>
      <li>but if I do, I want to use something that works as both sunscreen and makeup touch up during the day -- you know, applying lotion sunscreen on top of your makeup</li>
      <li>I love the fact that this is sun protection in powder form.</li>
      <li>Thank you!.Delivery  fast,  great price.</li>
      <li>I reserve the sponge for times when I either want more coverage over a foundation or wear the powder alone with no foundation under it).  </li>
      <li>I love that there&#x27;s no nasty SPF smell!</li>
      <li>My healthy wear compact was all I had, so</li>
      <li>Love this powder.</li>
      <li>so it helps to be able to apply spf that doesn&#x27;t add to your already shiny and greasy face.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>bought this along with the Healthy Wear tinted moisterizer to help it stay on longer.</li>
      <li>My favorite color is medium translucent.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this stuff.  </li>
      <li>an spf50--that is a great #, also it goes on pretty quick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for touching up throughout the day I definitely recommend this product!! :)</li>
      <li>Physician&#x27;s Formula looks just as nice on my face, plus has a higher SPF rating.  </li>
      <li>Since I have oily skin in the summer (where large pores prove a challenge to most powders), I find that his powder gives me the best, smoothest finish without becoming shiney with oil breakthrough during the day or turning orangey or \\&quot;standing\\&quot; in my pores, as so many other powders have done with my skin.  </li>
      <li>It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines.  </li>
      <li>and I stay shine free all day.</li>
      <li>Light</li>
      <li>When wearing this, I recommend going light with your foundation because if you don&#x27;t you will look cakey after applying this.</li>
      <li>It provides great coverage, even skin tone, as actually works as a sunscreen too.</li>
      <li>but I would say that if you go too light in dusting on that you will not get the full spf50 benefits--that is pretty much my own assumption.  </li>
      <li>light and medium.  </li>
      <li>I found that the translucent medium color matchs my winter skin but is too light for the summer.</li>
      <li>He swam, dove, rubbed his face, pulled his goggles on and off constantly and still got great protection.  </li>
      <li>This product was nearly life changing for my fair skin.</li>
      <li>So sad, because it&#x27;s got good ingredients, good SPF protection and good color matching.</li>
      <li>Everyday, golfing, boating...I&#x27;m very fair and burn easily.</li>
      <li>It looks sort of matte at first but will soon have a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>While they don&#x27;t recommend only wearing SPF powder for sun protection, there are so many physical UV blockers in this powder that I layer it over my foundation or sunscreen and am adequately protected from the sun, skin looking flawless.</li>
      <li>Physician&#x27;s Formula Healthywear fit the bill perfectly by providing superior sun protection without irritating my Retin-A sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It is pretty fine textured so your skin does look smooth not porous when you are done.  </li>
      <li>(L&#x27;Oreal True Match liquid was shiny, and Cover Girl powder foundation looked ghostly).</li>
      <li>For me, this is just a nice hint of natural color that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I like coverage I can build; sheer for good skin days, heavier for the hormonal ones.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it offer superior sun protection</li>
      <li>Does not make me break out      For those looking for adequate sun protection, these numbers speak for themselves:     </li>
      <li>I have super oily skin</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t break me out and gives me adequate sun protection for every day use.</li>
      <li>I get it mostly for the sun protection, as far as powders with SPF go, this one is pretty cheap for such good quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gives me a natural look that I am looking for and since I am typically a fair to light medium skin tone, this is perfect for the summer since i get a little more tan than usual.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am light in complexion, and the &#x27;light&#x27; translucent is a little too light, so I kind of do a mix with the trans.</li>
      <li>Love this powder -- it blends well with skin tone and looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>Using it with the Healthy Wear Tinted Moisturizer spf 50, color Natural to Tan.</li>
      <li>This is the best kept secret right here.</li>
      <li>I use another sunblock in conjunction, because I&#x27;m just not convinced I can get full SPF 50 protection without really laying the stuff on.  </li>
      <li>So much better than the last two I tried</li>
      <li>This is currently my wife&#x27;s favorite foundation....</li>
      <li>No burning, no breakouts, no dripping in my eyes when I get hot.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin primarily looking for sun protection.</li>
      <li>Even so, I really like this product</li>
      <li>this is real powder and lightweight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this powder.  I bought it to go over my foundation and it has a very nice texture.  It is not cakey.  The color is good for my light olive skin.  The main reason I purchased it is because of the spf factor.  I can use it during the day without having to deal with my liquid foundation.  Very few powders have spf.  This has spf 50 and I can just toss it in my purse.  Great purchase?</li>
    <li> I really like that it has SPF 50 mineral sunscreen (I don&#x27;t like chemical sunscreen). I am not one that wears foundation every day but if I do, I want to use something that works as both sunscreen and makeup touch up during the day -- you know, applying lotion sunscreen on top of your makeup is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought it twice, while I am happy about its SPF, I am not so fond about how it works as a powder foundation. I have combination skin, not particularly dry or oily. I usually wear this powder on top of moisturizer and BB cream, but despite this much moisture the powder still kind of look cakey and dry on my face. It makes my skin texture look rough and uneven. I switched to different types of sponges and tried to blend well, but still can&#x27;t get that silky natural look. I am not sure if I&#x27;d purchase this again, especially when I&#x27;ve found a good alternative -- Physicians Formula Mineral Wear - Mineral Airbrushing Pressed Powder SPF 30. It has similar mineral sunscreen ingredients, but with a softer and silkier texture.</li>
    <li> I constantly read makeup and skin product reviews by professional makeup artists/dermatologists and came across this recommendation. With doctors, dermatologists and even the skin cancer foundation urging people on having adequate sun protection, this is an ultimate gem. We all know that the sun is a main contributor to find lines and nobody likes age spots.     Even if you don&#x27;t care for sun protection, as a powder itself:     Smooth  Good coverage  Doesn&#x27;t easily look caked or unnatural the way many SPF powder foundations do  Leaves skin looking flawless   Esthetically, it really does rival a non SPF powder   Does not make me break out      For those looking for adequate sun protection, these numbers speak for themselves:     Active Ingredients:   4% Octinoxate - blocks UVB  21% Titanium Dioxide - physical blocker of UVA   3% Zinc Oxide - physical blocker of UVA    These percentages are humongous. While they don&#x27;t recommend only wearing SPF powder for sun protection, there are so many physical UV blockers in this powder that I layer it over my foundation or sunscreen and am adequately protected from the sun, skin looking flawless. I hate the shiny look sunscreens can give you, and Neutrogena&#x27;s Dry Touch line makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s burning as my skin is very sensitive. I also prefer physical UV protection over chemical ingredients like Avobenzone because they only last about 2 hours tops for sun protection while this powder will keep on protecting all day. I just touch up here and there if I sweat a bit or as hours have gone by.    I bought this powder for Buy One Get One 50% at the drugstore. Not all drugstores carry it. MSRP is about $15.</li>
    <li> I have always tried to take care of my skin--with sun protection being a big priority.  Over the years I tried expensive prestige brands of high SPF powder like Shiseido and Peter Thomas Roth. None has done as well for me as Physician&#x27;s Formula Healthywear Powder SPF 50.  (I found the brush applicator of the Peter Thomas Roth to be particularly stiff and of poor quality.  Neither the PTR or the Shiseido colors never really matched my complexion.)  One benefit of the Physician&#x27;s Formula Healthywear powder is that it is so inexpensive.  I can get it for around $14.99 at Ulta ($3.50 less when I use their coupon) or $12.99 at Target.  Not only does it offer superior sun protection but it also is a superior cosmetic product, giving my skin a smooth, porcelain like finish.  Since I have oily skin in the summer (where large pores prove a challenge to most powders), I find that his powder gives me the best, smoothest finish without becoming shiney with oil breakthrough during the day or turning orangey or \\&quot;standing\\&quot; in my pores, as so many other powders have done with my skin.  During the winter months, my skin becomes drier and I have found that this product works equally well then.  It stays matte without drying out my skin.  To get the sheerest finish, I use my Jane Iredale \\&quot;Handi\\&quot; brush to apply the powder (instead of the sponge that comes with it) over a base of Erno Lazslo \\&quot;Regular Normalizer Shake-It\\&quot; (A very light foundation/treatment).  I reserve the sponge for times when I either want more coverage over a foundation or wear the powder alone with no foundation under it).  I find that the sponge gives me a more complete coverage--but never cakey or too heavy like other products I have tried.  I also carry an extra compact with the sponge in my purse for touch-ups on my nose.  Back when I used Retin-A Micro, my dermatologist insisted that I use higher SPF products.  Physician&#x27;s Formula Healthywear fit the bill perfectly by providing superior sun protection without irritating my Retin-A sensitive skin.  I use the \\&quot;Translucent Light\\&quot; color.  I cannot say enough positive about this product.  I hope they ALWAYS continue to make it.  In the winter, I also use their companion tinted moisturizer under the powder which also has an SPF of 50.  Who knew there were such outstanding products at such reasonable prices?</li>
    <li> This works really well as a powder to set your foundation or contouring before you want to actually finish it.  You can use it by itself instead of with foundation and for summer or excercise it has good coverage.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> My sister and I have been addicted to the Peter Thomas Roth Mineral for a few years now... that is until this gem came along! The Physicians Formula SPF 50 is simply amazing and the Protection AND Coverage you get is superb! I have very oily skin and have found that just like the PTR, it really helps to keep your foundation on and the oil at bay. With the added SPF and at HALF the price, it is a dream come true! Thanks Physicians Formula, we now have a new addiction!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and seemingly everything I&#x27;ve tried putting on it causes me problems, especially sunscreen.  I am so glad I found this stuff.  It is great.  No burning, no breakouts, no dripping in my eyes when I get hot.  I really didn&#x27;t care about the make-up component of it.  I just wanted to try it as a cheaper alternative to other powder sunscreens on the market.  However, it turns out it is a great light coverage that evens my skin out a bit and doesn&#x27;t make me look cakey or made-up.  PERFECT!!      I took my 10 year old son to the pool the other day and forgot sunscreen...oh no! My healthy wear compact was all I had, so I tried it.  My son was mortified that I was putting make-up on him, but after looking in the mirror he was amazed that he couldn&#x27;t even tell.  I used it on his face, chest, and shoulders and hoped for the best.  He is fair skinned like me and burns fairly easily.  3 1/2 hours of sun exposure later and not a hint of sunburn.  Amazing!  He swam, dove, rubbed his face, pulled his goggles on and off constantly and still got great protection.  He has asked if he can use it from now on, although he doesn&#x27;t want anyone to see me putting it on him.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced.  Have used for several years.  Great SPF to protect your skin.  Light to medium coverage  My favorite color is medium translucent.</li>
    <li> I have fair-medium skin tone and was afraid the fair translucent powder would make me too pale so I got the translucent medium. It actually turned out a little darker and a little less translucent than I was expecting, but it&#x27;s not a big enough problem for me to not use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this along with the Healthy Wear tinted moisterizer to help it stay on longer. It looks sort of matte at first but will soon have a healthy glow. If you don&#x27;t like too much coverage I suggest using the thinted moisterizer by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re unfortunate enough to have a fuzzy face, the powder can slightly accentuate it, but I give it 5 stars because after a little use I saw it made my skin nicer, and I have never seen a make up product with SPF 50, which is great to prevent againg.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit nervous about using this product.  It arrived without the Physician&#x27;s Formula factory packaging.  The compact was wrapped in white plastic.  This is not how it was described.  Price was not much lower than buying in the drugstore.  I probably won&#x27;t buy from here again.</li>
    <li> A little light on my skin. I&#x27;m blonde hair blue eyes and don&#x27;t tan. Still I love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom.  She LOVES it!  For some reason Physicians Formula stopped making it so we had to buy it online.  They have another one, but it only comes with 30SPF.  So if you love this product stock up!!!  We did.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It provides nice even coverage, it blurs pores, covers blemishes, hides under eye shadows. It doesn&#x27;t crease, and doesn&#x27;t oxidate as the day goes on. I get it mostly for the sun protection, as far as powders with SPF go, this one is pretty cheap for such good quality. I break out occasionally, and minimally, and this powder hasn&#x27;t really affected that.</li>
    <li> I ordered medium but recieved creamy beige (so I subtracted a star). Even so, I really like this product - it covers well without looking like you&#x27;re wearing anything. It takes the shine away from my moisturizer and I stay shine free all day. It&#x27;s like a little miracle product. So much better than the last two I tried (L&#x27;Oreal True Match liquid was shiny, and Cover Girl powder foundation looked ghostly). The wrong color only looks too dark if I try to put a thick layer on, but I still need to get the correct color. I&#x27;m 49 if that helps someone.</li>
    <li> Terribly sad this is discontinued by PF, fortunately I can still buy on Amazon. I&#x27;ve used Clinique and Body Shop Pressed Foundation and this is by FAR the best and SPF50! I&#x27;ve worn it for years now. Everyday, golfing, boating...I&#x27;m very fair and burn easily. This product was nearly life changing for my fair skin.</li>
    <li> good product.  works as advertised</li>
    <li> This stuff works, I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re going to be outdoors or golfing! Much cheaper than some &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to break outs whenever I apply any sort of powder or foundation. I even have terrible reactions to facial sunscreens (I&#x27;m looking at you, Neutrogena!) This product doesn&#x27;t break me out and gives me adequate sun protection for every day use. It evens out my skin tone slightly but it isn&#x27;t opaque enough to cover up any blemishes. I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin primarily looking for sun protection. I love that there&#x27;s no nasty SPF smell!</li>
    <li> I have super oily skin and it is fair.  I need sunscreen and can only use physical sunblocks (zinc or titanium oxide) on my face, sunscreens with chemicals make my skin hurt and my eyes burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is an spf50--that is a great #, also it goes on pretty quick, you can adjust the coverage but I would say that if you go too light in dusting on that you will not get the full spf50 benefits--that is pretty much my own assumption.  I don&#x27;t cake it on but I do look matt and powdered when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am light in complexion, and the &#x27;light&#x27; translucent is a little too light, so I kind of do a mix with the trans. light and medium.  It is pretty fine textured so your skin does look smooth not porous when you are done.  Stays on well and absorbs a good amount of oil, at the end of the day it does get shiny on me but I am extremely oily and haven&#x27;t yet found anything other than accutane that puts the kibosh on that.</li>
    <li> Broke me out terribly, which is a shame because it seems like a good product. I don&#x27;t recommend it if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  I have their other tinted moisturizer that I really like.  The power foundation was just too light to do much good.</li>
    <li> This is currently my wife&#x27;s favorite foundation....unfortunately, it has either been discontinued or is being reformulated.  Too bad this happens so frequently....and seems to be more frequent with PF than with any other.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Physician&#x27;s Formula, and have been told that it&#x27;s the best drugstore makeup around.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the case, but it&#x27;s worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, sensitive skin.  I need a decent SPF.  I like coverage I can build; sheer for good skin days, heavier for the hormonal ones.  This powder provides both, and in between.  I use another sunblock in conjunction, because I&#x27;m just not convinced I can get full SPF 50 protection without really laying the stuff on.  I like the shine-control this powder provides.  It has also not caused any reaction from my skin, and when I use it on my eyelids, I get a longer wearing look and a bit of sun protection on my peepers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let your moisturizer absorb for 5+ minutes before application.  Press it on for longer wearing, heavier coverage &amp;/or to set your liquid foundation/tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this. Using it with the Healthy Wear Tinted Moisturizer spf 50, color Natural to Tan. Perfect combo. I am very fair and most makeup goes either too orange or too rose. For me, this is just a nice hint of natural color that lasts all day. I&#x27;ve searched a lot for a makeup-moisturizer-sunscreen (spf 50 required by my Dr.) product.  This is by far the best yet,  And it&#x27;s even affordable!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this powder except that something in it dries out my face like crazy...we&#x27;re talking flaky dragon skin...after only a week or so of use. So sad, because it&#x27;s got good ingredients, good SPF protection and good color matching. I recommend trying it out anyway though.</li>
    <li> Love this powder -- it blends well with skin tone and looks very natural.  Works as a sunscreen which is nice.  I never leave home without it.</li>
    <li> This is a great powder. Applying it and wearing it throughout the day, no one would know that you&#x27;re wearing a powder with SPF 50. This powder says it&#x27;s translucent, but its definitely not. This powder could be used as a powder foundation because it has heavy coverage (for a powder.) When wearing this, I recommend going light with your foundation because if you don&#x27;t you will look cakey after applying this. I haven&#x27;t ever seen this product in any store that carries Physician&#x27;s Formula products, with the exception of one Ulta. Since most of us have to purchase this online, finding the correct shade can be difficult. This shade was too dark for my pale skin tone. I should have gone with the lightest shade available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder has a wear time typical of most drugstore powders, and will require touch ups throughout the day if you are oily and if you wish to maintain the SPF protection this provides. The problem with that is that since it&#x27;s a heavy coverage powder, reapplying throughout the day will only lead to a cakey makeup look. It would be much better if they had a legitimately translucent version of this product for touch ups. In addition,  I don&#x27;t recommend using the sponge that comes with the compact, because it is a lot harder to apply and looks cakier than if you use a powder brush. This means that if you wish to touch up with this product you would have to bring a powder brush along as well, which can be a nuisance. All in all this is a good powder with great coverage, but isn&#x27;t ideal for touch ups throughout the day, which isn&#x27;t great because SPF has to be reapplied to maintain protection.</li>
    <li> Love this powder. It is a must have in the summer. When it is hot and sticky and you only want to apply the min of sunscreen (or non) it is nice to boost the spf with something that will help absorb. I would not use this powder for other things, it does not have the same texture as regular powder (thicker and heavier). I hope they are not discontinuing it cause I had a hard time finding it in stores in the spring. It is somewhat one-of-a-kind.</li>
    <li> Too cakey. After a few hours, it turns very oily. Does not protect from sun. I still got tanned.</li>
    <li> This is the best kept secret right here. I have used it through exercise, rain, Sun, snow, deployments the whole 9 yards. SPF 50, non liquid, stays on and lasts for hours. Just all around excellent. Why this was taken off the shelves I don&#x27;t know but thank you for continuing to sell it on amazon...it&#x27;s all I will use.</li>
    <li> Works great! Im impressed with the sub protection but I wish it didn&#x27;t come off when I wipe my face or sweat</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only foundation I wear and the only foundation I will ever wear. It doesn&#x27;t even look like you are wearing makeup or sunscreen. Does not dry my skin out, or cause any redness or itching (as some other powders do).  I have acne prone skin, but it seems that this actually helps prevent breakouts. It provides great coverage, even skin tone, as actually works as a sunscreen too.</li>
    <li> I put a little concealer on my trouble spots before I applied this using a powder brush.  It comes off into very very fine pieces.  It felt as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any foundation and it protected me from the sun.  I love this!  I wish they sold it in stores but I&#x27;m so glad I found it online :)</li>
    <li> i have oily skin so it helps to be able to apply spf that doesn&#x27;t add to your already shiny and greasy face. I can&#x27;t vouch for the protection as I am not out doors enough to test it. I always use an SPF creme in the morning and use this as touch-up during the day (as you cannot reapply creme over your make-up). I like that this removes shine and protects. I use this with a kabuki brush and i dont use the sponge it comes with. I found that the translucent medium color matchs my winter skin but is too light for the summer. It is good that they have a bronzer version of this as well, which i use for the summer.</li>
    <li> I bought it for myself then I found out the color doesn&#x27;t suit me. And I gave me to my mother. She is fair skin and i am medium skin. So she loves it :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because i thought it was my color</li>
    <li> This is perfect for the summer! It doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage but enough since i do not have much acne. It&#x27;s gives me a natural look that I am looking for and since I am typically a fair to light medium skin tone, this is perfect for the summer since i get a little more tan than usual. The great thing i love about this product is that it has SPF 50!!! It&#x27;s great for touching up throughout the day I definitely recommend this product!! :)</li>
    <li> After having tried other brands that were not satisfactory for my skin and purpose, I was glad I received a recommendation from a friend and purchased this powder foundation.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this, but it was a strange orangy color with a chalky uneven finish.  Not good, had to return it.  It was so bad I actually had to wash my face, as I didn&#x27;t want people staring at my strange orange face.  Really very unnatural color.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this is sun protection in powder form. My face gets oily quick especially in the summer so I don&#x27;t like to use sunblock lotion as it makes me greasier. This leaves me nice and matte. I wish it came in a darker color. The medium is lighter then usual medium powders. I wish it came in a darker color but this is the darkest.</li>
    <li> usually they are cream type:  I had a hard time finding powder at reasonalbe price. this is real powder and lightweight.</li>
    <li> Good quality make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister gave me hers a couple years ago because it was the wrong color for her skin and I have been using it ever since! This package lasts for many uses, I usually get 3-6 months use out of one compact. Great coverage, doesn&#x27;t make me break out or anything. I always get compliments on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it has SPF 50 as well so I am protected from the sun all day. Anti-aging!</li>
    <li> I bought this foundation to replace Bobbi Brown powder foundation which is nearly three times the price.  Physician&#x27;s Formula looks just as nice on my face, plus has a higher SPF rating.  It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Thank you!.Delivery  fast,  great price.</li>
