      <li>I love to use it under my curls in a bottle and the pattern pusher.</li>
      <li>and hers is pretty good, to Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful, Shea Moisture and a host of others, and so far this has been the most moisturizing one I&#x27;ve used..with or without heat.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s good!!!</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing this again and without a doubt recommend for anyone looking for a great conditioner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fun scent, but I don&#x27;t always wanna smell like a smoothie. :)</li>
      <li>I hope this product is available for ever; and don&#x27;t ever change the formula.</li>
      <li>it made my hair nice and soft, but i&#x27;ve had better.</li>
      <li>Its a bit pricey but definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Junkie makes many quality products that are very curls-friendly (and friendly for a variety of hair types, frankly).</li>
      <li>This conditioner is by far the best I have tried in a long time.</li>
      <li>So, I have to deep condition WEEKLY for optimum  hair.</li>
      <li>Always looking for a good deep conditioner.  </li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite conditioner.</li>
      <li>I could have overlooked that if it really worked better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally buy high protein products but this product is really good.  </li>
      <li>overall it is a must have for healthy ethnic hair :)</li>
      <li>My hair was very easy to detangle and still soft and moistened even after the rinse out.  </li>
      <li>will try it on its own again before I make a final decision.</li>
      <li>I tried this product on after reading the reviews from a natural website and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and easy to detangle</li>
      <li>My hands, hair and nose love the sensation of scrunching and rinsing this pompsity of goodness from my hair leaving me with deep conditioned hair-satisfaction!  </li>
      <li>SO I really like this DC!</li>
      <li>First let us talk about the smeill.  </li>
      <li>I have one more application left.</li>
      <li>tried this product and the first time I used it, my hair felt like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>no major difference like many of the reviews boasted ( I bought this product based on its recommendation on Curly Nikki and the positive reviews I saw on here).</li>
      <li>Full-bodied and very easy to distribute in your hair.  </li>
      <li>When I received the first container of conditioner, it was opened and yet, supposedly came straight from the manufacturer in that condition.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is very wavy and curly and it gets very tangled at the roots, this helps with that alot.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely</li>
      <li>Ok it took me a longtime to use thus product, because I wanted to get rid of my other DC to make room for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>same cute bag but different color.  </li>
      <li>While there are other deep condiioning treatments out there that are just as effective and moreso</li>
      <li>My hair type is medium to fine, light brown, wavy, can friz up a little in humid weather, and responds well to a lot of basic conditioners or moisture treatments.</li>
      <li>it coats the hair so nicely and the consistency is like a thick clumpy pudding.  </li>
      <li>and it leaves my hair detangled and very soft.</li>
      <li>Scents are not usually my thing, but this has turned me around.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other deep conditioners, from Miss Jessie&#x27;s rapid recovery treatment......</li>
      <li>you can  see the herds in the DC and the smell will bring you back too your childhood on the first day you experience ice cream and the feeling you got.</li>
      <li>This is not my first jar of the deep fix leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>This deep fix provides so much moisture.  </li>
      <li>I have 4C natural hair.  </li>
      <li>so you can ensure your getting complete coverage</li>
      <li>Soft tones of Bananna melded with a dessert like undertone of yum yum.  </li>
      <li>When I was researching products for the natural curl, this is one of the items that was brought to my attention.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair shiny and soft and smelling</li>
      <li>Not only does it come to you so quickly, but it comes with a cute little small bag that you can put your hair products in.</li>
      <li>I am a 4c natural with low porosity.</li>
      <li>the first time i got a black one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice since purchasing and am thoroughly pleased.  As soon as you massage the conditioner in, your hair is immediately softened....and I do mean immediately.  My hair was very easy to detangle and still soft and moistened even after the rinse out.  I&#x27;ve tried many other deep conditioners, from Miss Jessie&#x27;s rapid recovery treatment......and hers is pretty good, to Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful, Shea Moisture and a host of others, and so far this has been the most moisturizing one I&#x27;ve used..with or without heat.  I will definitely be purchasing this again and without a doubt recommend for anyone looking for a great conditioner.</li>
    <li> Always looking for a good deep conditioner.  I would put this on par with some of the best that I have found.  It works well on my hair and smells devine.  I will try more Curl Junkie products.</li>
    <li> if you have dry hair, this is the stuff for you.  it coats the hair so nicely and the consistency is like a thick clumpy pudding.  it smells awesome.  it hydrates immediately and stays that way for days without re-applying the product.  its expensive but its worth the money. i will purchase again and again.  it is just what it says, \\&quot;a deep fix\\&quot;.  And what makes it even better the shipping service is excellent also! Not only does it come to you so quickly, but it comes with a cute little small bag that you can put your hair products in. and you get that bag for each time you order.  the first time i got a black one. the second time i ordered i got a white bag. same cute bag but different color.  also you get a coupon each time you order for $25 off of a $100 or more purchase.  cant beat that wit a bat.</li>
    <li> While there are other deep condiioning treatments out there that are just as effective and moreso (example, Joico&#x27;s K-Pak and MyHoneyChild&#x27;s Olive You), this is one of the tools in my dry hair arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had dry, frizzy hair, but since developing thyroid problems in my thirties, my hair went crazy dry--like straw in some spots, no kidding. So, I have to deep condition WEEKLY for optimum  hair. This is one of my fave products when I&#x27;m in the mood for the bubble-gum-meets-banana-smoothie scent. It&#x27;s a fun scent, but I don&#x27;t always wanna smell like a smoothie. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on after washing hair, cover with a shower cap, and apply a diffused blow dryer to the exterior to heat it up, then I leave it on for an hour or more. It leaves your hair shiny and soft and smelling super-sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curl Junkie makes many quality products that are very curls-friendly (and friendly for a variety of hair types, frankly). I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have 4C hair and I swear by all of her conditioners. It smells delicious and it really moisturizes my hair. Great to use all year round but seems to work best in the humid Midwest summers. A little goes a long ways so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on after reading the reviews from a natural website and I am so glad I did. The texture, scent, and the way it moisturizes is great.  While it is a little pricey, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> SO I really like this DC! The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a five is because it tangles up my hair when I rinse it out. I have 4a/4b hair. My curls are tight; like small to medium corkscrew curls!! So I&#x27;m thinking since this product encourages the development of curls it makes my hair tangle. This is the same reason I don&#x27;t do wash and gos often... tangles, SSKs... just chaos... My Holy Grail DC (Shea Moisture&#x27;s Purification Masque) doesn&#x27;t do this. It encourages curls (for me at least) as well but it doesn&#x27;t tangle up my hair when I rinse without combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, it does soften and encourage curls... but I don&#x27;t want the hassle of detangling my hair twice (once during shampooing and then after DCing)... Other than that, it&#x27;s good!!!</li>
    <li> it made my hair nice and soft, but i&#x27;ve had better. it worked it did its job but it wasnt the best.</li>
    <li> Ok it took me a longtime to use thus product, because I wanted to get rid of my other DC to make room for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you open it you can  see the herds in the DC and the smell will bring you back too your childhood on the first day you experience ice cream and the feeling you got. I&#x27;m in the process of creating my own shampoo and conditioner and I hoping the smell of mines make everyone feels the way this DC made me feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend to everyone to try it. My hair is so soft and easy to detangle</li>
    <li> First let us talk about the smeill.  How do I describe this company&#x27;s delicious smelling creamy - creamy mixture of wonderfulness.  Soft tones of Bananna melded with a dessert like undertone of yum yum.  Let us move on to the texture of the product.  It feels like a decadent pudding in your hand.  Full-bodied and very easy to distribute in your hair.  I believe you can be as generous as you want with the amount applied.  I then put a plastic cap on ... I get a little heat going with some vacuuming, gardening, etc and then I rinse.  Good luscious moisturizing feelings.  My hands, hair and nose love the sensation of scrunching and rinsing this pompsity of goodness from my hair leaving me with deep conditioned hair-satisfaction!  Do this one curly heads!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is by far the best I have tried in a long time. It detangles, conditions, and Oh my GOD add&#x27;s beautiful SHINE! The smell is so good, I read the reviews and kept reading about the great smell. Scents are not usually my thing, but this has turned me around. Sometimes I open it up just to take a whiff. This product surpassed my expectations. My hair is very wavy and curly and it gets very tangled at the roots, this helps with that alot. I cant wait to try more of the line.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy high protein products but this product is really good.  I use it with my steamer, and the banana smell is so yummy</li>
    <li> This is not my first jar of the deep fix leave in conditioner. I had to buy more before I ran out. This is my absolute favorite conditioner. I hope this product is available for ever; and don&#x27;t ever change the formula. It works perfect on my 3b-3c natural. This deep fix provides so much moisture.  I love to use it under my curls in a bottle and the pattern pusher. Well worth the cost.  And it smells so good.</li>
    <li> I used this til it was all gone and it kept my hair strong and moisturized!</li>
    <li> I am a 4c natural with low porosity. My hair hated this product on the first application- no major difference like many of the reviews boasted ( I bought this product based on its recommendation on Curly Nikki and the positive reviews I saw on here). Because it is expensive I wanted to give it a second try. I find when I mixed it with raw organic honey it actually softened my hair and my 4c curls popped. I am not certain if I will continue to purchase this product. I have one more application left. will try it on its own again before I make a final decision. I did not like the smell.</li>
    <li> I combine this product with Hair Rules Leave-In Conditioner together in the shower and it leaves my hair detangled and very soft. The product also smells very good. It smells like baby aspirin.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!  It makes my hair smell and feel absolutely delicious! Its a bit pricey but definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Love how it makes my hair feel and behave.  I definitely recommend this product.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> My hair loved this conditioner. I used the condtioner with a steamer.  I have 4C natural hair.  I loved the product but not the price.  I will purchase again only at the cheaper price.</li>
    <li> This product was a complete disappointment.  When I received the first container of conditioner, it was opened and yet, supposedly came straight from the manufacturer in that condition.&lt;br /&gt;It had tape over the lid, yet the lid was cocked open and the protective seal underneath the lid was open.  This was a disgusting thought, that they sent me a used product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, when I received the 2nd container, it also had tape on the lid, as if it had been opened.  Not sure what to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and the first time I used it, my hair felt like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
    <li> This was disappointingly sticky on my hair. It left my hair straw-like and horrible. It gets three stars becasue my mother found it to be great on her hair when I gave it to her, and also the ingredients are quality and the smell is pretty yummy like cake. My hair type is medium to fine, light brown, wavy, can friz up a little in humid weather, and responds well to a lot of basic conditioners or moisture treatments.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all it made my hair feel like sandpaper.It smells good but does nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> When I was researching products for the natural curl, this is one of the items that was brought to my attention. Just a little does a lot!</li>
    <li> This product was moisterizing, non tacky, and smelled awsome! I would absolutely but it again. I just wish it wasent so expensive. But great:)</li>
    <li> I use this product on two strand twists, it smells amazing and the ingredients aren&#x27;t too bad. Give my twists extra shine and bounce!</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t like this one but I still love so many of the CJ products.</li>
    <li> Love Love LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;First of all I received my product in 2 days which was awesome and of course I couldnt wait to use it. I co washed my 3c/4a hair and applied the product generously to my hair and put a plastic cap and let it sit for about 45 min (no heat)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-The smell is awesome! its like banana bubble gum&lt;br /&gt;-Complete moisture and instant curl definition&lt;br /&gt;-Good consistency so you can ensure your getting complete coverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-It is a small amount and for my thick hair im going to need to purchase a lot more often than I would prefer&lt;br /&gt;-Kind of pricey&lt;br /&gt;But overall it is a must have for healthy ethnic hair :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner isn&#x27;t a miracle worker. I only noticed a slight difference in my hair. I thought the smell was awful. I could have overlooked that if it really worked better.</li>
