<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I broke out in severe acne or a rash within a day of using the product. I am in my fifties, so acne is not normal! Looked nice on my curly hair, but it also made my head itch. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy to curly hair... frizzy, but not un-manageable. I recently started wearing them curly by using products to enhance the curls.&lt;br /&gt;I paid about 15$ for this at a local salon that suggested this would not be as stiff as the 4$ mousse! And they are right, it is not stiff.&lt;br /&gt;But it is not that great for my hair. I have short shoulder length hair and I applied a good amount to my hair when wet.&lt;br /&gt;My hair didnt loose the frizz. So I decided to sleep on it and see the results next morning... still the same! So I ended up finishing it off with the 4$ mousse anyway!&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT buy this product again... maybe for 5$ I will, not for 15!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time in the summer when things are much more casual. I can get out of the shower, scrunch my hair with this lotion and I am good to go for the day.</li>
    <li> I believe this is an update for the previous curl product (medium hold). It is wonderful. It holds well and isnt as stiff once it dries. My hair is manageable and soft!  Note: i have short hair.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and this product helps keep it in control. Only use a small amount or your hair will get that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Light hold and feels great.</li>
    <li> It really works! It really define curls!</li>
    <li> Smooths my curly hair.</li>
    <li> A good curl cr&amp;egrave;me.  Doesn&#x27;t make your hair goopy or crispy if you use the correct amount.</li>
    <li> thanks so much and sorry it took so long to reply just goy my computer back from the shop&lt;br /&gt;so thanks so much</li>
    <li> great product for curly hair</li>
    <li> Frizzy hair is gone and soft curls are left in its place!  I highly recommend this product for permed hair!</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and frizzy. Curls fall out easily and many products weigh it down or make it too stiff. This one keeps my hair flexible and light while bringing out the curl and fighting frizz. The light scent is nice, and doesn&#x27;t activate my migraines or nag at me all day.</li>
    <li> Gives a flexible hold to curls/waves when applied to damp hair. I use this everyday for a sexy beachy hair look and always get compliments</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair and I fell in love with it. It never feels sticky or stiff. The next day you can just spray your hair with water and scrunch it with your fingers to bring back the curls. One tube lasts a long time. It is a good value and a great product.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t what I thought it was.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as what I really wanted.  May be okay for someone elses hair but mine is dry and very curly.  This one just doesn&#x27;t cut it (for me).</li>
    <li> This is nice enough and in some ways like the Matrix Contouring Milk that has been taken off the market. The Milk was the best stuff ever for fine hair and smelled mild and nice. This product smells like mens aftershave and the hold is &amp;#34;crunchy,&amp;#34; not soft like the other (much better in my opinion) product. Looks good, but doesn&#x27;t smell or feel as good.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I ever used to bring out curls and keep frizz down. I hope they never stop making this.</li>
