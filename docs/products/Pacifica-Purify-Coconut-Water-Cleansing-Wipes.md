      <li>This removes makeup, even the kind that is waterproof.  </li>
      <li>They do smell nice, and they remove my makeup, but I, too, found that they caused a burning sensation, and not just around my eyes.</li>
      <li>I wish I liked them more</li>

      <li>I love the scent as well as the way my skin feels.  </li>
      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>Carry on safe is what I was told.</li>
      <li>So refreshing to use after a day in the desert</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t use the wipe immediately it also does it very quick.</li>
      <li>So glad to have a face wipe that leaves my face feeling clean but also smooth.</li>
      <li>He experienced the same breakouts but more quickly than I did.</li>
      <li>They are also quite refreshing on a hot summer day.</li>
      <li>They leave my skin clean.</li>
      <li>The first week these simply felt clean with a great scent.  </li>
      <li>My husband is now using the wipes as well because they simply feel good on his face (trust me, there&#x27;s no beauty regimen in his vocabulary.)  </li>
      <li>The main reason I prefer wipes to liquid or cream cleansers is that (most brands I&#x27;ve tried) remove all makeup, including waterproof eye makeup in one step, and they&#x27;re convenient for travel.</li>
      <li>Very soft and refreshing.</li>
      <li>I love the coconut, it leaves my skin soft.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin (although under control at the moment), and these coconut water wipes are great for when I need to refresh my face after a long day at work or after a workout.  </li>
      <li>Very convenient, doesn&#x27;t leave skin sticky once it dries, and makes my skin feel nice and soft without any oiliness - highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t repurchase; I&#x27;ll go back to using my drugstore brand cucumber &amp; tea baby wipes for cleansing/makeup removal, which are much more economical anyway.</li>
      <li>I am ready to buy a case of these!</li>
      <li>I use this twice daily and then use the Pacifica Serum on top.  </li>
      <li>(Also, Pacifica shipped much quicker than anticipated!</li>
      <li>I do wash my face post using these wipes as part of my skincare routine, but found they really remove the makeup!</li>
      <li>I will be trying their face cleanser next as I am so pleased with the wipes.  </li>
      <li>wish they were more easily accessible and less $$ however.</li>
      <li>i love the subtle scent and refreshing feeling they leave me with.  </li>
      <li>I have combination skin, prone to large pores and breakouts under the skin.  </li>
      <li>but I can get them at Whole Foods for</li>
      <li>purchased a package of these wipes at Whole Foods Market for about $6.00.</li>
      <li>Vegan, refreshing, and wet enough to clean your whole face plus some.  </li>
      <li>Will be my new go-to!</li>
      <li>Like others, my skin tingles a bit following use; however, the mild sensation dissipates, thus leaving my face</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt; for sure ill order more</li>
      <li>Before bed, I wash my face with my normal combo skin cleanser and night moisturizer, and the dryness is not an issue.  </li>
      <li>(I live in Phoenix).  </li>
      <li>I like it especially in the hot sun area we live in.</li>
      <li>l have recently discovered these wipes, even though I have a number of other Pacifica products, all of which I love.  </li>
      <li>long as Pacifica makes these, I&#x27;ll certainly be repurchasing them!</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft now.  </li>
      <li>Not for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t broken out from this product, and the scent, while a bit stronger than I had anticipated, is lovely.  </li>
      <li>However - just because these have \\&quot;coconut\\&quot; in the product name doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re any more natural than any other wipe out there.</li>
      <li>This has helped so much that only during the PMS time do I have even a little bit of issues-a major difference.  </li>
      <li>Odd, as most cleansing wipes are, so a) why would that be common sense?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these.  Portable, no water needed, they smell good and make your face feel revilalized.  I take them camping, on trips to skip the liquid face wash.  Carry on safe is what I was told.</li>
    <li> These smell amazing and clean well too!</li>
    <li> I ordered those wipes from Pacifica website and they came at around 7 bucks a pack. I like the smell- I&#x27;m a big time coconut fan and everything that smells like coconut. The wipes are refreshing but they sing my eyes when I tried to remove eye makeup :( also the made the dry pays off my face itchy. Not sure if it&#x27;s a certain ingredient or what. If you don&#x27;t use the wipe immediately it also does it very quick. I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase them again. I wish I liked them more</li>
    <li> These get the job done, hence 3 stars. However - just because these have \\&quot;coconut\\&quot; in the product name doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re any more natural than any other wipe out there. Coconut water is only 4th on the ingredient list. I didn&#x27;t read the directions prior to use (they&#x27;re cleansing wipes for goodness&#x27; sake, how hard can it be?!) but apparently I should have, because they stung the skin around my eyes down to mid-cheek area - and once I read their \\&quot;common sense caution,\\&quot; I saw that it said they aren&#x27;t intended for use in the eye area. Odd, as most cleansing wipes are, so a) why would that be common sense? and b) I&#x27;ve never had any other cleansing wipe sting my skin, eye area or elsewhere. I won&#x27;t repurchase; I&#x27;ll go back to using my drugstore brand cucumber &amp; tea baby wipes for cleansing/makeup removal, which are much more economical anyway.</li>
    <li> use these when i&#x27;m traveling to wash the face, pits or whatnot.  i love the subtle scent and refreshing feeling they leave me with.  wish they were more easily accessible and less $$ however.</li>
    <li> ok but expensive could do just as well with face wipes for way less</li>
    <li> I use these wipes when I walk in the door after work to remove makeup and let my skin breathe a bit.  I have combination skin, prone to large pores and breakouts under the skin.  The first week these simply felt clean with a great scent.  The second week i started to notice breakouts, but I realized the breakouts were coming from under the skin (proof, in my unprofessional opinion, that the detox was working.)  My skin does feel a bit dry now that I am using these regularly, which is why I&#x27;ve stuck to using these when I walk in the door at night.  Before bed, I wash my face with my normal combo skin cleanser and night moisturizer, and the dryness is not an issue.  I will be trying their face cleanser next as I am so pleased with the wipes.  My husband is now using the wipes as well because they simply feel good on his face (trust me, there&#x27;s no beauty regimen in his vocabulary.)  He experienced the same breakouts but more quickly than I did.</li>
    <li> Waaaay overpriced. Way cheaper at Target.</li>
    <li> So refreshing to use after a day in the desert (I live in Phoenix).  I just love this brand!  I purchase mine at Target for $5.99 a package.</li>
    <li> This product goes everywhere with me. Just in case, I have bought one pack for every handbag. These cleansing wipes are wonderful; they smell great, and they clean hands and/or face thoroughly. They are also quite refreshing on a hot summer day. I have been buying these for months...and I will keep buying them. Best cleansing wipes out there...</li>
    <li> l have recently discovered these wipes, even though I have a number of other Pacifica products, all of which I love.  These are not an exception!  I love the scent as well as the way my skin feels.

    <li> very good product, love the coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;multiple use, make my skin feel good and clean&lt;br /&gt; for sure ill order more</li>
    <li> Very soft and refreshing. I like it especially in the hot sun area we live in. I add more water spray to it and use it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these wipes! Face wipes are a must for me as I don&#x27;t like using water and cleanser, makes a mess all over my sink.&lt;br /&gt;Having tried numerous types of facial cleansing wipes, I can say these are my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;They smell amazing, and feel as refreshing as they smell. Doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful things like sulfates or parabens.&lt;br /&gt;I have been dealing with bad blemishes on one side of my face from cysts and after using these consistently, followed by Etude House masks, my skin is starting to look noticeably better.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the wipes cause a slight stinging feeling on my skin after use but it fades quickly and is, I assume, from the Papaya.&lt;br /&gt;Heartily recommend giving these a try.</li>
    <li> These face wipes are amazing. They smell awesome! So glad to have a face wipe that leaves my face feeling clean but also smooth. I have found others to be too harsh for my skin. I do wash my face post using these wipes as part of my skincare routine, but found they really remove the makeup! Will be my new go-to! (Also, Pacifica shipped much quicker than anticipated! Great plus!)</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t repurchase. Not for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a package of these wipes at Whole Foods Market for about $6.00. They do smell nice, and they remove my makeup, but I, too, found that they caused a burning sensation, and not just around my eyes. The main reason I prefer wipes to liquid or cream cleansers is that (most brands I&#x27;ve tried) remove all makeup, including waterproof eye makeup in one step, and they&#x27;re convenient for travel. Since these definitely shouldn&#x27;t be used around the eyes, they don&#x27;t meet my needs.</li>
    <li> Great for your face and the environment.  Vegan, refreshing, and wet enough to clean your whole face plus some.  This removes makeup, even the kind that is waterproof.  I use this twice daily and then use the Pacifica Serum on top.  My skin is prone to cystic acne, deep in the skin.  This has helped so much that only during the PMS time do I have even a little bit of issues-a major difference.  My skin feels so soft now.  I am 43.  I cannot recommend this product and this line enough.</li>
    <li> I saw these in a fitness magazine and decided to try them.  I love these, I use them after my workout they are so refreshing! They leave my skin clean.I love the coconut, it leaves my skin soft.I am ready to buy a case of these!</li>
    <li> These wipes are awesome but I can get them at Whole Foods for half the price- don&#x27;t spend $13!</li>
