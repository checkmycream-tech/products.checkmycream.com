<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great, lightweight, oil that I use in my morning coffee or in my salads as a dressing.  It is lightweight enough to use several times a day and is a great tool for those who are following a low-carb diet such as myself.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Makes bullet proof coffee which is much healthier and improves energy.</li>
    <li> Used as a dietary fat burning supplement and found it to be too sweet. Tried using it as a sweetener but it was not cost effective. after a month of use, it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, but several have had broken caps.  Not a big issue during shipping as it has a safety seal, but inconvenient when it won&#x27;t seal properly once you start using the oil.</li>
    <li> Saved some dough with 2 pack, so great value</li>
    <li> Good substitute for the bulletproof executive brand.  I have used NOW products for quite a while, and have always found them to be of high quality.</li>
    <li> Can not go wrong with a great product for a healthy lifestyle.  Have been using this for a long time and do not regret it.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described. Light oil with neutral taste. I use it in salad dressings. I&#x27;ll order from this source again.</li>
    <li> Neurologist recommended MCT OIL for husband, we r both taking it, I use in place of any other oil, cooking, baking, salad dressings, smoothies, mix a teaspoon in yogurt, soup, pasta etc. invaluable&lt;br /&gt;3 -4 times a day for best Brain food.</li>
    <li> This seems to be great oil. I feel great when I take it.</li>
    <li> For the few who may have had most of their intestines removed,&lt;br /&gt;this is what my mom uses to help absorb fats better so she can&lt;br /&gt;maintain a healthy weight...she seems to think it helps, so I order it for her</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful.!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps you lose fat, gain muscles EASILY, provides lots of energy during a low carb diet... A must have for working out!!</li>
    <li> Great oil takes on the flavor of the food you&#x27;re cooking.  Benefit of weight loss is just an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Arrived well within promised time frame, bubble wrapped &amp; taped inside an inner box that was also bubble wrapped and packed in the shipping box. I was a bit concerned at a huge gash in the inner box, that was the only sign of trauma. The product itself is a great source of sustained energy that doesn&#x27;t cause blood sugar spikes. It does take a little while to adapt gastrically.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and received the package in a timely manner. To my dismay, one of the bottles had leaked out a bit in the packaging. I didn&#x27;t think much of it at the time as only a few tablespoons leaked out. A few days later, CB Select sent me an email inquiring about my purchase. I told them about the leak. They promptly responding with crediting my account with $8. Also, this product is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL,DR: Great customer service and product. I plan on using CB Select and this particular product again in the future.</li>
    <li> Some Great stuff, cheap worth it for the price. Came quickly and didn&#x27;t disappoint I plan on ordering it again</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand of MCT for over two years, and I love it.. and deliver is fast, and they way the wrap the glass bottles are wonderful.. Never have I received a broken glass before. And yes, I also do the High (Plant) base fat diet and low carb.. And this really does work..</li>
    <li> It tastes like oil.  Medium Chain Triglycerides seem like a fad food, I see it on more food labels than chipotle was in the early 2000&#x27;s.  But you know what?  I get this stuff for my weekly nutrition shakes, and after I drink one I feel like I could pick up the Incredible Hulk and throw him over the Great Wall of China.  I&#x27;m sure the MCT oil helps in no small part.</li>
    <li> I originally started buying this to add to my bulletproof coffee, but I add it to the protein shakes that I take a few times a day as well. Adding this to my normal exercise and diet regiment helped me lose fat, no doubt about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it arrived several days earlier than the estimate, and I choose the slowest method. This has happened every purchase, and I&#x27;ve been consuming this stuff for months now.</li>
    <li> great product ....use it all the time</li>
    <li> I use this product to enhance my low carbohydrate diet with much success.  I like being able to add MCT to things without having a coconut flavor.  I will reorder this product when needed,</li>
    <li> My local healthy foods store doesn&#x27;t always have this great oil in stock, so I was wiling to purchase through Amazon.  The bottle size looks small in the online photo, but 32 oz is actually pretty large.  This oil has a very mild flavor so it&#x27;s easy to add to foods.  I keep it in the fridge and it does not get solid like coconut oil.  I received it timely, and it was very well packed, so no damage to the glass bottles.  (Maybe a bit too well packed...hard to cut off the bubble wrapping.)</li>
    <li> I take this MCT oil everyday. I am losing more weight that I ever did on the low carb diet. The fat is burning off fast! I am very happy with my purchase. I will be ordering again and again. Super fast shipping. Product exactly as listed. If someone has a problem with the oil dripping down the bottle simply order a salad oil bottle and put the MCT oil in there. MCT oil works!!! I have the keto stick results to prove it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product very much, helps keep me healthy. I enjoy it in my meals. I keep repurchasing it over and over, I always get two at a time.</li>
    <li> Only the mildest of taste, which is good for my use.  Seems like a very good product.  My husband and I use a lot of it in our coffees (ala bulletproof exec) and marinades for roasted chicken and fish.</li>
    <li> I mix this, half and half, with either olive oil or avacado oil, for a homemade salad dressing.  It&#x27;s a light oil so it mixes well.  I also put it in my coffee or shake before a weight workout in the mornings.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil to include in your dietary intake. It is great in that it doesn&#x27;t have any taste or flavor so it assumes the flavor of whatever you use it with. Well worth it as well as the nutritional benefits that comes with it.</li>
    <li> After hearing about all the amazing benefits of Medium-Chain Fatty Acids, I picked up this product. I add a bit to any smoothie I make. I have a seizure disorder, and do notice that my \\&quot;auras\\&quot; or any hint of a seizure coming on seem to be much less frequent when I&#x27;m eating MCT Oil or some form of coconut fat on a regular basis. To read more about MCTs, I recommend reading \\&quot;The Coconut Oil Miracle\\&quot; by Bruce Fife, or any of his other books that look interesting. This product can only benefit you (unless you fry the heck out of it), so there&#x27;s nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> GOOD FOR YOU WAS RECOMMEND BY MY DOCTOR.  GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND HEART.  EASY TO TAKENOT A BAD TASTE</li>
    <li> Unlike most reviewers, this oil is a necessity for me because I do not digest fats. MCT oil, coconut oil, and palm oil are all high in mid chain triglycerides which can be absorbed through mucosal membranes and do not require digestion to be converted to fatty acids in the bloodstream. I regularly use extra virgin, high MCT coconut oil, and I like some of its properties, like the butter-like qualities (it&#x27;s a solid at room temperature). I do have to eat MCTs daily to maintain fatty acids necessary for protein digestion, and because Now MCT oil is solely MCTs, it is a life saver for me. Those with issues of fat digestion due to illness or surgery, will find this product useful in maintaining a healthy diet and weight. I&#x27;m just happy I can use fats again in my cooking.</li>
    <li> Quality, good value, Love it, etc etc.  I need 13 more words to submit this review.  Now four more.  There I did it.</li>
    <li> I love MCT oil. Especially in my coffee</li>
    <li> Got this in a 2-pack figuring if I liked it I would be set and if I didn&#x27;t I wasn&#x27;t out too much $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I love it!! I add it to my coffee (with kerrygolds grassfed unslated butter) and whip it up in a blender. That 16oz cup of coffee will keep me sustained until at least noon, and usually til 2pm (and I start drinking it at 5:00am). Look up \\&quot;bulletproof coffee\\&quot; on google and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talkin about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, I work in construction so it&#x27;s not like I sit at a desk. I&#x27;m on my feet and going hard.. This was just what I needed to sustain myself and get work done (I can&#x27;t stop and eat a \\&quot;small hand sized meal\\&quot; every 2 hours, whatever that&#x27;s all about).. The MCT oil just gives you that long lasting energy (and no highs and lows like a sugary drink would).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this with a homemade vinagarette as a salad dressing. Just it in (like its olive oil-but use it more sparingly), with the greens and drizzle the vinegarette on (tossing it all together optional).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I will be purchasing more and I will be getting it from amazon. The price is good and the shipping was really fast (3 days or something like that).</li>
    <li> IN REALLY LIKE THIS STUFF..Makes me feel better, Healthier, and Keeps a person Regular as well..Has a Good Flavor, use it in cooking, not high temperatures, and like it in a salad with some cayenne pepper an garlic..It prepackaged well, comes in A  Brown Glass Bottle, This helps to keep item Fresh. Give it a Try,I Bought 2 Bottles..Comparable to other MCT Oils,, Price.Cheaper Quality SAME ..You Won&#x27;t Go wrong.</li>
    <li> Because I just received this and have just started using it I rated it low. I haven&#x27;t had enough enough time for a fair evaluation of the product but based I past reviews I decided to try it. I like reading the reviews before I purchase something and in most cases they are very valuable.</li>
    <li> The main benefit from MCT oil is that it kills Candida yeast which most people have in their intestinal tract- which causes bloating and all kinds of other problems. My stomach is much flatter when I use it(if your doctor tells you that Candida can&#x27;t live in the digestive tract, tell him to get current on his info). Everyone should be using this if they eat refined sugars or starches. Now MCT oil is high quality, and unlike another brand I tried from Vitacost, the tamper seal was actually intact and the lid was on tight which meant that it was not spilled all over by the time I got it!</li>
    <li> The oil tastes no different that the 2 other brands I have tried in the past, but when ordered in a 2 container multipack, it is 1/4 the cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottles came quickly, well packaged and undamaged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying again(but in a 3 pack... which seems to be the best value).</li>
    <li> I tried this product after a recommendation from a well respected trainer.  Took my stomach a few days to get used to it, but it works as expected.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time, getting much healthier on ketogenic diet</li>
    <li> 3 Stars because product is 5 star, while seller (HerbsPro) is 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge fan of MCT oil. Great for Ketogenetic dieting. And now foods brand is great. Mix it into coffee and protein shakes. Great energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it from Herbs Pro. Choose a different seller if you have to choice. Took over 2 weeks to arrive with standard 3 day shipping option. Zero response from seller when queried.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for MCT oil. Love the 2 pack. Now company IS pharmaceutical grade same as others promote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan of regular virgin coconut oil which is suppose to help with thyroid and weight loss. I used about three tablespoons a day as recommended.  While I have seen a difference in my skin and  hair I haven&#x27;t seen huge differences in weight loss as I have with the MCT oil.&lt;br /&gt;My first week I have lost a pound a day and now second week I am losing at least a pound every other day. And.. I&#x27;m 60.  For two decades I haven&#x27;t been able to budge my weight no matter what I tried.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I am doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have three recommendations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One: Standard Process Purification and Weight Loss Kit (available here on Amazon) There are a lot of pills in there and it may seem pricey but it works like nothing else has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two: go see Dr Eric Berg videos on youtube.  He is a wealth of info and also has great products. Dr Berg talks about purification/detox as well.  He said that you have to get well FIRST and then you loose weight, not the other way around.  I found that to be true as well.  Once you cleanse your liver the weight starts to come off.  You may see no results for awhile even months but then all of a sudden it starts coming off.  Depending on what your health was. Have patience. Really keep on doing and eating the right things and it will come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three:  Use three tablespoons of MCT oil a day.  I split it up throughout the day.  I can honestly say I have done the same routine with and without the MCT oil and the oil has absolutely made a difference. I was using straight coconut oil in my shake or cooking my eggs in it (well still do that, its so yummy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AM: Omelet; loaded with goodies such as mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, spinach. (not much cheese right now if any)&lt;br /&gt;or have a boiled egg. I have boiled eggs around at all times for my fast food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AM snack:  A Shake.  I use Standard Process shake OR Dr Eric Berg shake (wonderful and chocolate, LOADED with nutrition)&lt;br /&gt;In this shake I used the MCT Oil about on tablespoon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch:  Small chicken salad, loaded again with goodies.  Use a light dressing!  You can use 1 tablespoon on your salad if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PM afternoon snack say around 3 or 4pm:  A shake, with two tablespoons MCT OIL.  (or save to put on salads)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PM Dinner:  I eat about the palm of my hand size meat. I eat chicken and fish a lot.  Some steak. I am not as big on beef myself.  With that I steam broccoli and cauliflower and eat mounds of it. Dr Berg recommendations is to eat 8 cups of veggies a day. More cruciferous type veggies.  More above ground veggies vs below ground ( such as potatoes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before bed: This one is just me. They say don&#x27;t eat 3-4 hours before you go to bed but I sleep better if I do eat something. I usually make it a boiled egg. Something simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eat about 3 apples a day (helps clear the liver)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it.  It is actually a LOT of food and you aren&#x27;t hungry and I really don&#x27;t miss anything.  THE BIGGEST KEY IS TO STAY AWAY FROM WHEAT AND OTHER GRAIN.  Period.  Don&#x27;t do it. I no longer miss bread and I use to grind my own wheat and make my own bread every week. Talk about missing something. I don&#x27;t miss it.  My asthma is WAY better, no pain in my body, my skin (eczema) has clear completely up.&lt;br /&gt; Read WHEAT BELLY.  Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health by William Davis&lt;br /&gt;The book will scare you straight.  Makes sense and I am living proof it matters.  Who knew wheat is GMO and we can&#x27;t digest it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts...as said MCT oil made a difference.  It is tasteless which helps a lot in using it wherever you want to. It boosts your metabolism.  How do I know.. because it makes me feel &#x27;hotter&#x27;. I have no problem with getting the runs as someone was worried about but I think that is because I spread out the times I use it.  Using it before bedtime didn&#x27;t really keep me awake but it did keep me too hot to sleep.  Its not like you will walk around sweating but  you are warmer.  In air conditioning or cooler days you won&#x27;t really notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Increase your B Vitamin intake.  That helped with energy and fat metabolism too. I used Nutritional yeast and put it in my shakes. Now Foods Nutritional Yeast Flakes (here in Amazon)  This is not a requirement but one more thing that gives a boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Standard Process products are top shelf.  There are a LOT of pills to take. But for once it mattered and I am dropping weight where I haven&#x27;t been in over two decades as I said.  If you want to avoid the cost start with just the MCT oil and eating as suggested.  Be sure to eat plenty of food. Less is not helpful at all.  I noticed by eating something about ever three hours I loose much faster!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lost an average of 10 lbs in two weeks and I&#x27;m still loosing effortlessly between one half to a pound a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exercise?  If I can.  I haven&#x27;t much because of asthma and being seriously out of shape for so long (being sick).  I have tried to ride my bicycle some or walk.  I love the Sunpentown Healthy Swing Machine with Swivel Disc by Sunpentown (here on Amazon $93 currently)  See youtube video on that one.  For those who can&#x27;t exercise much this works wonders. The down side to the swing machine is it doesn&#x27;t get your heart rate up or your lungs ( a plus in my case) but I do need to exercise my heart! So it can&#x27;t be the everything.  It is considered a &#x27;passive aerobic&#x27; exercise.  &amp;#34;Aerobic means -With oxygen&amp;#34; which does help to burn fat.  You can feel the tingle when you stop. Cool beans!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck! I will stay on MCT oil forever.  Triple the coconut oil benefits?  Can you get better than that!</li>
    <li> I use this as my massage oil!  Fabulous stuff!  I also use it in my coffee and it is wonderful</li>
    <li> This was recommended for me to use by my nutritionist to help with my severe Crohn&#x27;s disease.  My body has quit absorbing &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; fats and I&#x27;d fallen into the category of severe malnutrition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPS damaged my shipment (ok, they supposedly ran over the box?) and when I contacted this company, they promptly emailed me back and I received a replacement in 4 days!  Very impressive :)</li>
    <li> Love this Stuff. Heats fast- be aware.&lt;br /&gt;I just this for everything!! I cook with it. I put it in my salads and I even&lt;br /&gt;spread it on my dry legs!</li>
    <li> I purchase the bulk pack as the price is much lower.&lt;br /&gt;However for some reason after 3 they start to raise the price per unit again.  @ 3 the price is ~$13 but  jumps up to $18 per bottle for order or 5.  This seems a bit dubious to me.  It seems like they are trying to catch people who might assume they will get the best discount with a larger order.</li>
    <li> Great product. I mix it in my coffee and don&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
    <li> My title says it all! Of course 32 oz is a pretty big bottle. I was shocked about the size but very pleased with the value.</li>
    <li> Really good oil as a supplement and for low cooking temperatures.  I like to add a tablespoon in my smoothies.  Both bottles arrived well-packaged.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Tastes fine in my blended drinks.</li>
