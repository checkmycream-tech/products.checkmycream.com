      <li>Favorite product.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product</li>
      <li>Skin care products I&#x27;ve ever used- love all their lines.</li>
      <li>Love how finely milled it is and</li>
      <li>It matches my skin tone perfectly and it covers all my flaws without me having to use foundation or other things.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The coverage is great and it doesn&#x27;t agitate my already existing skin problems, in fact, I have better skin because I switched makeup and only use this powder now.</li>
      <li>hands down, the BEST.</li>
      <li>smoothes your face, yet light , yet like great coverage, my dermatologist recommended and i don&#x27;t look at any other kind now</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe the coverage, yet feels so light.</li>
      <li>Your skin looks smooth and silk wearing the foundation</li>
      <li>Careful with color selection, otherwise great product.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fall into lines/wrinkles, but provides full coverage.  </li>
      <li>the best product for sensitive and dry skin</li>
      <li>This is the only makeup I feel good about putting on my freshly washed and moisturized face.  </li>
      <li>Stays on all day, subtle but effective and good for the skin.</li>
      <li>Love this makeup easy to use and last all day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got great coverage alone and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when used over a liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m the one being asked, or told how fresh my face looks.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed a significant savings over what I pay for this makeup locally.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>As I recall, it did break pretty quickly within its container though</li>
      <li>Product came in brand new packaging and was received very quickly.</li>
      <li>I will most likely return this item.</li>
      <li>ok people its two different brands, and</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>I know this one is not harmful to skin and very natural looking, but not the right shade for me.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>really like it.</li>
      <li>I have very combination skin and varies with hormones.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive, combination skin, prone to break outs hormonally or from things such as accidentally touching my face while using my cell</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recccomend Glo Minerals to everyone &amp; all ages.</li>
      <li>Box was damaged and the product does not look like the one I normally purchase in the store.</li>
      <li>Light feeling on the face, and the pressed powder allows you to add as little or as much as you want.</li>
      <li>This is a very natural skincare line.</li>
      <li>It controls shine without looking powdery--rather, it leaves skin with a natural looking glow.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
      <li>No reaction on my sensitive skin (I do wash my brushes once a week), and no drying or caking.</li>
      <li>Medium coverage, even over old red acne scarring.</li>
      <li>and then I obsessed trying to find a good container to put all of the loose powder in I</li>
      <li>I usually only apply once in the morning and will only freshen up if heading out again in the early evening.</li>

    <li> Ladies! This is the best product out there! I have sensitive skin and rosacea. My skin looks healthy and flawless!!</li>
    <li> the best product for sensitive and dry skin</li>
    <li> Great makeup. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Love this no breakout covers awesome</li>
    <li> I love my Glominerals compact! I usually only apply once in the morning and will only freshen up if heading out again in the early evening. Medium coverage, even over old red acne scarring. No reaction on my sensitive skin (I do wash my brushes once a week), and no drying or caking.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! It covers well and yet does not feel like I am wearing anything. I have sensitive, combination skin, prone to break outs hormonally or from things such as accidentally touching my face while using my cell phone.&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of this and have tried new things since, due to cost, but I think I will go back and hunt this down. It was great! As I recall, it did break pretty quickly within its container though and then I obsessed trying to find a good container to put all of the loose powder in I would not have gone to all the trouble had I not LOVED this product</li>
    <li> Careful with color selection, otherwise great product.  Love how finely milled it is and the coverage is nice.</li>
    <li> This is a very natural skincare line. Order the Evion facial spray to go with it for a finished look.</li>
    <li> For thoes of you that are wondering no this is not a fake brand and the people that are making that statement sadly dont know what they are talking about this. I went to college at GCI for skin care and this is the same name brand they use and it works and it is wonderful! This is GloMinerals not bare minerals ok people its two different brands, and YES I do feel this is a better brand. It matches my skin tone perfectly and it covers all my flaws without me having to use foundation or other things. ;-) I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> smoothes your face, yet light , yet like great coverage, my dermatologist recommended and i don&#x27;t look at any other kind now</li>
    <li> All I can say is flawless finish! I asked someone else who had beautiful skin what they used and that&#x27;s why I  started using glo minerals. Now I&#x27;m the one being asked, or told how fresh my face looks. I own a gift shop any many days I don&#x27;t have tint to retouch, with this, my face never needs blotting. Looks great all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this powder for years and I will never switch to anything else. This powder can be used alone or over foundation. It&#x27;s got great coverage alone and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when used over a liquid foundation. It controls shine without looking powdery--rather, it leaves skin with a natural looking glow. A little goes a long way, so it lasts a long time. I have oily, acne prone skin on my t-zone and dry skin on my cheeks and this powder works well on both. My skin always looks and feels great with this.</li>
    <li> I still can&#x27;t get the hang of using mineral products.  I know this one is not harmful to skin and very natural looking, but not the right shade for me.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup easy to use and last all day.</li>
    <li> Product came in brand new packaging and was received very quickly. I enjoyed a significant savings over what I pay for this makeup locally. I&#x27;ve been using GloMinerals for the past decade and its &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; quality can&#x27;t be beat!</li>

    <li> Quick delivery and exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Stays on all day, subtle but effective and good for the skin. Mine last one lasted over a year. YES!</li>
    <li> Best foundation I have ever used.  Doesn&#x27;t fall into lines/wrinkles, but provides full coverage.  Light feeling on the face, and the pressed powder allows you to add as little or as much as you want.</li>
    <li> Perfect color and shipped with no issues.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  It leaves a nice matte finish which is a plus for me.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing coverage, friends want to know where they can get their hands on it.</li>
    <li> Love my compact!  I can&#x27;t believe the coverage, yet feels so light.</li>
    <li> The coverage is amazing and the price is even better.  Buying from a cosmetic surgeon you pay about $40.  I am very happy.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase!  I have been using this makeup for awhile now and really like it. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Glo Minerals for 8 years- my plastic surgeons office introduced me to it- hands down, the BEST. Skin care products I&#x27;ve ever used- love all their lines. HIGHLY recccomend Glo Minerals to everyone &amp; all ages.</li>
