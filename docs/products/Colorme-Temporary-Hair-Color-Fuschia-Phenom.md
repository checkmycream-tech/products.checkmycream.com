### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This was a very good product.</li>
      <li>so it showed up very good.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product!</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I am getting this again, I used it for one medium sized streak from the roots to the end for about two weeks before the tube ran out, this was with re-applying it after every wash to keep the color bright.</li>
      <li>I already bought some of this in Violet Desire and loved it, so I bought some of this, as well.</li>
      <li>The color is excellent and very vibrant and bright.  </li>
      <li>I have used these products before and love them!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>This is a great color and is easy to use with the mascara wand.</li>
      <li>I would recommend that you style your hair first and lightly hairspray then add this color whereever you want to see touches of fuschia and then re hairspray and it will stay perfect.  </li>
      <li>I love these-</li>
      <li>Will be purchasing more colors.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I love adding some every time I straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>Wish you had more colors.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It washes out easily without residue.</li>
      <li>And with the applicator, it&#x27;s really really really easy to get it in her hair.</li>
      <li>It does wash out of the hair easily, but not the skin</li>
      <li>It has, however, rubbed off a bit on a light colored jacket and on a pillowcase.</li>
      <li>Very fun color..</li>
      <li>Fun product!</li>
      <li>they go on easily, stay throughout a wash and are fun to use.</li>
      <li>We tried to get more product out; we had not left top off.</li>
      <li>This is easy to apply, and after it dries, I can brush through in and have a lovely bright pink glow in my medium reddish blonde hair.</li>
      <li>This is a great little mascara type wand that you can run through your hair and add a splash of color.  </li>
      <li>I put a few streaks in the front of my (brown) hair in the morning, and they showed up great.</li>
      <li>Overall I liked it.</li>
      <li>so I was hoping for a more &#x27;natural&#x27; feel to it</li>
      <li>The color of this was fun.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s fun.</li>
      <li>I love it and will be buying more and other colors</li>
      <li>Color stays bright until you wash and it fades to a barely there light pink.</li>
      <li>But, this PINK color shows up really nice.</li>
      <li>Really recommend it, if you want temporary hair color that is fun.</li>
      <li>This is my first time dying my hair with anything like this</li>
      <li>If you are a &amp;#34;bleach&amp;#34; blonde you will retain some of the color for more than one wash but it fades quite a bit.</li>
      <li>This hair mascara shows up very vibrantly in my chestnut brown hair, without any lightening of my hair&#x27;s pigmentation beforehand.</li>
      <li>Really makes your hair &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; and does not smudge like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>and my face was stained pink for days where my hair was touching my face.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;One of the gals wants one.  </li>
      <li>Very pigmented.</li>
      <li>I purchased this as an alternative to the Color Bug (due to iffy reviews), and thought this product would stay on better.</li>
      <li>This temporary hair color is better then some of the other stuff on the market.  </li>
      <li>The color is very easy to apply with the mascara wand and not too messy.</li>
      <li>I use plastic gloves so my hands don&#x27;t turn pink although it is easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>I add a tiny bit during the day, just a hint for my straight laced job, and on the weekend, I play with it.</li>
      <li>Takes me 3 washes to get it out completely</li>
      <li>I have dirty blonde hair and it stays in mostly with a light wash, though if I want it out in one I&#x27;ll just use a lot of shampoo.</li>
      <li>I solved this by applying it when my hair was damp, about ten minutes or so out of the shower, and then after I applied it I sprayed the streaks with One&#x27;n&#x27;Only Argon Oil spray, which really got rid of the chalky feel to the hair.</li>
      <li>These colors are fun to streak your hair with, a little or a lot.</li>

<li> These colors are fun to streak your hair with, a little or a lot.</li>
<li> I even watched some YouTube videos on how to apply this and heat-set it with a blow dryer, but it doesn&#x27;t really ever set and it feels stiff and sticky.  </li>
<li> Absolute mess!</li>
<li> Trouble is, a week and several washings later the pink was still visible in her hair.</li>
<li> The color was very subtle in my brown hair but vibrant in my daughter&#x27;s blonde.</li>
<li> The color eventually went away but be careful before using this on anyone who needs to keep to a &amp;#34;natural</li>
<li> If you use it on color-treated hair (e.g., blonde highlights), the color will stay longer and fade out over a few hair washes.</li>
<li> She loves showing people her pink hair chalk.</li>
<li> I actually put in my hair wet, then style as usual.</li>
<li> The product is stiff in hair if you don&#x27;t blow dry it out.  </li>
<li> They don&#x27;t show up that well in dark brown hair.</li>
<li> Specially on a little girl that loves colored hair.</li>
<li> my sister in law bought this for my daughter in purple and green.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> There was no more.</li>
<li> If I can&#x27;t work in the garden or do my usual workouts without the product running, it&#x27;s not for me!  </li>
<li> Not good.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not great for sweaty dancing.</li>
<li> An awful waste of $8 that I don&#x27;t have!</li>

    <li> Works great. Very pigmented. Takes me 3 washes to get it out completely but I have bleached hair.  Color stays bright until you wash and it fades to a barely there light pink. Will be purchasing more colors.</li>
    <li> my sister in law bought this for my daughter in purple and green. They don&#x27;t show up that well in dark brown hair. But, this PINK color shows up really nice. And with the applicator, it&#x27;s really really really easy to get it in her hair. She loves showing people her pink hair chalk. Really recommend it, if you want temporary hair color that is fun. Specially on a little girl that loves colored hair.</li>
    <li> This is easy to apply, and after it dries, I can brush through in and have a lovely bright pink glow in my medium reddish blonde hair. I add a tiny bit during the day, just a hint for my straight laced job, and on the weekend, I play with it. It has, however, rubbed off a bit on a light colored jacket and on a pillowcase. It&#x27;s not great for sweaty dancing. But it&#x27;s fun.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I already bought some of this in Violet Desire and loved it, so I bought some of this, as well. This hair mascara shows up very vibrantly in my chestnut brown hair, without any lightening of my hair&#x27;s pigmentation beforehand. It&#x27;s so simple to use; you just take the mascara wand and rub some in your hair. I love adding some every time I straighten my hair. Also, the color is temporary, so you can switch it up as often as you want, and it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair...unlike the standard hair dying process of bleaching sections of the hair before applying the color. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This temporary hair color is better then some of the other stuff on the market.  You do have to put a lot on in order for it to show up on darker hair, which means there is only one or two uses in each tube.  I probably would recommend this on lighter color hair.</li>
    <li> These colors are fun to streak your hair with, a little or a lot. Stays on till you wash it out.</li>
    <li> The color of this was fun.  The problem is that the product lends a gummy texture to the hair.  I even watched some YouTube videos on how to apply this and heat-set it with a blow dryer, but it doesn&#x27;t really ever set and it feels stiff and sticky.  The color also comes off on everything.  I worked in the garden and sweated and my face was stained pink for days where my hair was touching my face.  If I can&#x27;t work in the garden or do my usual workouts without the product running, it&#x27;s not for me!  It does wash out of the hair easily, but not the skin it&#x27;s stained.</li>
    <li> Not good.  Your hair gets all tangled in these and the color comes out all globby.  Threw away!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I love it and will be buying more and other colors</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an alternative to the Color Bug (due to iffy reviews), and thought this product would stay on better. Absolute mess! I put a few streaks in the front of my (brown) hair in the morning, and they showed up great. But by mid-morning this stuff was everywhere - on my hands and my clothes! Was so dissapointed! Next time will probably get clip in streaks.</li>
    <li> This is a great little mascara type wand that you can run through your hair and add a splash of color.  The color is excellent and very vibrant and bright.  I would recommend that you style your hair first and lightly hairspray then add this color whereever you want to see touches of fuschia and then re hairspray and it will stay perfect.  Love it.</li>

The color eventually went away but be careful before using this on anyone who needs to keep to a &amp;#34;natural hair colors only&amp;#34; dress code.</li>
    <li> Very fun color.. Went to a brunch and everyone thought it was cute.&lt;br /&gt;One of the gals wants one.  Wish you had more colors.</li>
    <li> This was a very good product. I have blondish brown hair so it showed up very good. It looked sort of redish but it could just be my hair. Overall I liked it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it. We tried to get more product out; we had not left top off. There was no more. An awful waste of $8 that I don&#x27;t have!</li>
