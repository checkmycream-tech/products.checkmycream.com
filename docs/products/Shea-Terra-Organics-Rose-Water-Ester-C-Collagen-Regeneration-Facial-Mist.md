      <li>I live in Germany and in the winter you need moisture, worked great.  </li>
      <li>In fact, if you&#x27;re not mad about rose smell, you probably don&#x27;t want to buy this bc</li>

      <li>the scent is ok, not bad at all..</li>
      <li>In the summer, with no A/C, still felt great and was very soothing on a hot day.  </li>
      <li>I sprayed a little on my neck, the smell wasn&#x27;t that impressive</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>The product itself sits in a glass bottle and to me only great products come in glass bottle.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used rose water and first of all, I love the smell.  </li>
      <li>It is the first time for me to buy this product, and I really love its smell of roses.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do love roses, so when I spray my face and neck im smothered in rose petals. I also love the force of the spray...two sprays and my whole face and neck r covered. my face has started clearing up now that im using this instead of Aveda along with the black soap.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Smells great, not overpowering.  Had none of the weird smell issues with this bottle (only had one so far).  Feels great.  I live in Germany and in the winter you need moisture, worked great.  In the summer, with no A/C, still felt great and was very soothing on a hot day.  I am not getting regular facials right now but have noticed my skin looks and feels good (though I am doing other things so can&#x27;t 100% say it is this product).  Packaging is good and spray works great with even distribution in 2 pumps.  I will be getting another bottle here shortly.</li>
    <li> I love this. The scent is pleasant, not over powering. It is great at hydrating, especially during the horrible winter months!</li>
    <li> This toner makes my face and my décolleté super-red and super-itchy.  It takes a long time for my skin to calm down. I&#x27;m not allergic at anything and have been using topical vitamin C on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a way to get Vitamin C delivered to my skin in liguid form.  This not only makes my skin look healthy it soothes the dryness after I was with my acne soap.  I get a healthy glow after spritzing this product.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a facial mist with Vitamin C.  I don&#x27;t enjoy the slight weird smell though but I cover it up with a moisturizer that eliminates the odor.</li>
    <li> this facial spritz is a favorite of mine, it smells so good and is good for your skin</li>
    <li> This product has a weird after smell, not at all like the way heritage rose water smells. I have not noticed any improvement with my skin. I will not be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells and makes my skin feel!!! A good antioxidant for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with my black soap to add moisture back into my face.  Although, it smells like roses at first. Later it smell horrible.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product several times.  It smells wonderful and natural.  It will not give you a headache.  It is refreshing, cooling and hydrating to the skin.  I have very dry skin so I love this product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This Rose water spray Smells Wonderful! It feels wonderful! I cant resist not spraying this wonderful scent all over myself ;-) Loooove it!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly,smells GREAT. Very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin red when I spritz it on,but settles down pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It really tightens my skin,including pores,though mine aren&#x27;t bad to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;I do use a vitamin c serum with hyaluronic acid afterward.</li>
    <li> i like this product.  it&#x27;s nice to spray on after a shower.  the scent is ok, not bad at all..</li>
    <li> I like what this does for my complexion.  It is mild, yet it smooths and helps to exfoliate.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. It smells good and feels good. Very refreshing. I can&#x27;t swear it&#x27;s making my skin any nicer, it might be,  but I keep using it because I love the light smell.</li>
    <li> Awesome all natural toner. I use morning and night and instantly skin feels refreshed and clean. Non-drying and non-irritating. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t do a review unless I cannotlive without and shea terra  rose water is one of those products. OMG smells just like real roses but aside from the  smell it works LOOOOVE!:-)</li>
    <li> Everything is good in this product except the 0.5% potassium sorbate as a mild preservative.  At first it makes a tingling burn on the face, but soon diminishes.  Great scent.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any change, but I love the smell and the feel of it.  Very soothing.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used rose water and first of all, I love the smell.  I like to use it at night before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and leaves my face soft, yet my skin feels firm.</li>
    <li> Arrivdc on time. Very refreshing. Love it</li>
    <li> A good facial mist, I use it after applying make up in the morning and later in the day if it&#x27;s a hot day.</li>
    <li> Smells great , very refreshing .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even care if it has any long term benefits. The smell is heavenly and this rose water spritz makes your skin feel as soft as a rose.</li>
    <li> powerful stuff. You can feel it penetrating. I&#x27;ve used rose water for years to great effect, and the added zing of the C really makes this product worth buying - not much more expensive than the regular rose water. Really awesome smell too. In fact, if you&#x27;re not mad about rose smell, you probably don&#x27;t want to buy this bc it is PUNGENT. I can&#x27;t tell if its making my face look better or not but for my purposes it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> this unfortunately burns my skin&lt;br /&gt;normal rose water doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;so it must be the ester c in it? not sure&lt;br /&gt;but it has worked for others&lt;br /&gt;i have rosacea so fro those with rosacea be warned</li>
    <li> use it every day, love the scent!</li>
    <li> Makes face feel tingly and refreshed,smells like rosewater.Will buy again !</li>
    <li> I will never be without this product, helps to nourish the skin and smells like a rose. 5 STARS all the way!</li>
    <li> I have tried several Shea Tera products and haven&#x27;t been disappointed with any of them. They are gentle and effective!</li>
    <li> Spray my face often with it.Gives an instant refresher to your face. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;Like the fragrance of roses. Like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I use this religiously every night, it makes my skin feel so refreshed!</li>
    <li> So disappointing. I was really excited to try this product after reading all the great reviews on here. 1st thing that happened is that I didn&#x27;t even receive this product. They shipped the wrong item, I got the Moroccan Rose Replenishing Beauty Water. If I was rating that I would give it 5 stars. I love it and it only made me more excited to try the Rose water with Ester C, so I ordered it again in a combo deal with the black soap. I love Shea Terra products and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction to any skin product, but this irritated my skin, especially my neck turned bright red. I looked like I had a sunburn. It had a slight burn feeling to it as well. I will continue to use other Shea Terra products, but I&#x27;ll stay away from ester c.</li>
    <li> Great for your face it refresh your face on a hot day. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to open it up, it was a bubble wrapped and came in an amazon box. The product itself sits in a glass bottle and to me only great products come in glass bottle. I sprayed a little on my neck, the smell wasn&#x27;t that impressive and since I just used it once I don&#x27;t know how well it&#x27;ll work yet. I just thought Id mention about the glass container.</li>
    <li> I have given this product a week and the only thing i notice is that it leaves my face dry, and it burns. i love the smell but after it has set for awhile it tends to have smelly fragrance in my nostrils. i bought this product thinking it would be better because it is &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brand but so far i am unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle and ordering more, just in case Amazon runs out when I need it.  I love the light rose scent and how it feels on my skin.  I use a moisturizing toner (from Origins) then spray this on my face/neck/chest generously.  I wait until it dries then apply moisturizer.  Like other reviewer said, it has a tightening effect without drying the skin (I have a normal/dry skin).  I am 40 and have noticed my neck looks tighter since i&#x27;ve been using the product.  I&#x27;ve given this as a gift to several women in my family.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The first week I had this product, I really enjoyed the moisture it provided my face. However, I did notice that it became a habit of having to refresh my face with the mist 2-3x a day. After the second week my face started breaking out in red patches of heat and irritation minutes after applying. I then avoided using the product for a week, and then tried again, only to have my face break out again. This may be just my experience, but I will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> It is irritating for my skin, even though, right now my skin becomes much healthier.</li>
    <li> very refreshing.  I spray it on to set the makeup, and also on warm days it feels good for cooling off.  thanks</li>
    <li> It is the first time for me to buy this product, and I really love its smell of roses. I used it everyday after cleaning my face, knowing that there are no junks and fake stuff in it to harm my skin.</li>
    <li> After applying moisturizer, I spray this on my face &amp; it feels wonderful.  During the day I spritz it on again, &amp; my skin feels renewed.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Purchased similar (and much more expensive item) at the day spa I receive regular facials from and loved the result on my skin.  Since I didn&#x27;t want to pay the spa prices again, I found this item and gave it a try.  Same wonderful result - my aesthetician said my skin is feeling softer since my last visit.  I spray my face after showering and after about 20 minutes (time it takes for me to finish getting dressed), then I apply my usual daily moisturizer or night cream.  It smells lovely and my skin loves the extra moisture.</li>
    <li> I would like this product, except that the Ester-C component really irritates my skin. A few minutes after spritzing, my skin turns bright red and stings like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t sensitive to it, I guess it&#x27;s a great product. It does smell nice.</li>
    <li> Started using this about 9months ago after reading reviews on amazon.  This product has brightened my skin, helped with fine lines and smells wonderful. I use this along with other products for my skin I have discovered on amazon reviews.  I&#x27;m 67 and I have people always commenting that I look much younger, can&#x27;t beat that when all I wanted was to brighten my skin and help dark age spots...it works.  I bought 2 bottles this last time, I do not want to be without this product!  Just spraying it on gives a person a breath of fresh air in the morning...I would buy for the fragrance and that outdoor feeling it eludes.  I am allergic to long term rose fragrance, but this product is very light and I am able to tolerate it without a reaction.  Watch the price, sometimes you can get a really good deal....Love AMAZON...Love this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not, but the rose smell is fantastic and the ingrediants can&#x27;t be beat so this is a fave for me.</li>
    <li> This is my third Shea Terra purchase and I believe that hands-down, these are the best of the best in \\&quot;natural/organic\\&quot; skincare. I don&#x27;t know how or why the ingredients seem to be at a different level of \\&quot;active\\&quot;, but they are.  You see results the first time you use them, and this product is no different.  I&#x27;ve used topical C off and on for many years now, but this seems to be like those products on steroids.  The lifting and tightening effect for me is almost immediate.  It probably helps that I use the black soap products, but this is an extraordinary product.  I use it right after I cleanse my skin morning and night, then let it dry, then apply my other products as usual. Instead of toner, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.  I like the smell...it is delicate and faint.  The active ester C in the product is the icing on the cake.  Try it ladies, especially if you are in your 40s, to jump start any other products you are using, and to tone and tighten your skin.  I tried to grab my skin to test the elasticity (because my skin was that tight), and I could barely grab any...that&#x27;s how tight and lifted my skin had become after useage.  Not in a dry, tight, way, but in a firm, lifted, \\&quot;young skin\\&quot; way.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, feels terrific on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was excellent and price was reasonable.  The pump works perfectly with an ample amount of spray.</li>
    <li> I have never smelled anything like this before. It is like putting rose perfume on your face. The smell is so overwhelming that I could not use it. I would be sick smelling this all day!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, but my skin does not seem to like it. I really love the Shea Terra organic oils. lotions, soaps I have purchased but this product seemed to really irritate my skin. I turned bright red  and the skin around my mouth and became chapped and irritated. (This irritation was noticeable and did not subside for days) My whole face seemed to burn from it. Parts of my skin were really inflamed even after washing it off with lots of cold water. I thought I might build up a tolerance, like with glycolic acid but my reaction was so intense I didn&#x27;t continue after the first couple tries. Also, it didn&#x27;t burn in a good way, like papaya enzyme or glycolic acid seems to for me, it burned in the &amp;#34;I am having an allergic reaction&amp;#34; way. The skin on my neck is less irritated by this, so perhaps I will continue using it there in the hopes it will hydrate my neck, increase collagen and prevent wrinkles; I want to use up the product and I want those benefits from vitamin C that everyone is talking about. I love the smell  so I will probably try to continue using it on my neck for the scent as well, if the skin on my neck builds up a tolerance to it and doesn&#x27;t become more irritated I MIGHT consider trying it on my face again.</li>
    <li> smells like socks. at first it smells a bit like rosewater, and i emphasize a bit, but in a few seconds( when drops dissipate), it startes smelling like an old sock soaked in a months old water. very disappointing. threw it away, right away.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and is refreshing on my skins</li>
    <li> being in a dry, stuffy office all day took its toll on my skin. only in my early 30s, i began noticing dryness and overall lackluster appearance. a friend of mine, a practicing makeup artist, suggested i try rosewater. this is the only rosewater spray i found that does not contain BHT and other similar carcinogens, and at half the cost of brands i was leaning towards (Juralique, Fresh, etc). This product smells great and after a day or two i could sincerely notice a significant difference! i didn&#x27;t change my overall face routine, just incorporated this spray 3-4 times daily while sitting at my desk over my light Clarins foundation. i&#x27;m hooked!    ***a (somewhat humorous) warning to those with VERY sensitive skin*** while tipsy one night during the holidays, i had 4 friends over and was very excited to spray this on their face (ok perhaps i was more drunk than tipsy). 3 out of 4 friends loved the results; the 4th, well, his face became sunburn red within 30 seconds of spraying twice, and the redness did not go away for a good 45 mins. thus. if you&#x27;re sensitive to vitamin C, i would suggest a rosewater WITHOUT the Ester-C, as it is potent. but for my needs, it ROCKS.</li>
    <li> refreshing spritz..wonderful rose fragrance  I keep a few bottles handy for a pick me up....I suppose you could transfer some into a smaller bottle for purse too..</li>
    <li> I just started using this spray and can already see an improvement in my skin</li>
