    <li> My husband has used this shampoo since using a small guest bottle it in a bed and breakfast about 10 years ago.  It takes very little to lather up his hair and it gives his hair a shine and softness and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I never had a problem with Amazon items before, but this was a big disappointment to me this time. The seals were broken on the  shampoo and the conditioner  I did not send the items back although I probably should have. sent them back but I threw  them away disgusted</li>
    <li> I love the subtle, herbal smell of this cleansing shampoo. My favorite cleansing shampoo, Neutrogena, is getting harder and harder to find. I cam across this at a hotel I stayed in, and liked it enough to hunt it down on Amazon. It&#x27;s comparable in quality and price to the Aveda cleansing shampoos (which remove residue from styling creams, etc., from your hair). The price is a bit much, though.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing.  After years of suffering with dandruff and hair loss, this product has dramatically improved my hair and scalp health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as body wash so I can&#x27;t say how well it works on hair.  It&#x27;s got a great smell and very nice feel.  Perfect to wake you up feeling spicy.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and so glad I found it on Amazon. It smells fantastic and leaves my hair light and manageable and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I found it in a 5-star hotel at Laguna Beach, CA on vacation and now it is all I use. Free shipping at Amazon came in 1 1/2 days! Very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> No hint of mint or thyme like the hotel product.  How do you spell BAIT AND SWITCH?</li>
    <li> Cleans hair very well while not leaving it dry.</li>
    <li> I first used this hair wash at the Borgata Hotel in Atlantic City.  It makes my hair look beautiful.  I have pure white hair and this shampoo makes it very manageable, plus it  smells delicious.</li>
    <li> not as good as I had hoped it was ok, but not worth the price</li>
    <li> I first tried this wash as a sample in a hotel and really liked it.  So glad I found it on Amazon - wish it were still available.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Makes my hair so soft. First tried this brand while staying at a hotel in Portland.</li>
    <li> I first used this shampoo in a nice hotel in Spain. I found the sample recently and was pleased to learn that I could buy this product in the USA. Nice shampoo and it has a nice clean fragrance. The scent is not over powering, like many products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products on my hair - very thick and very fine - until I lost hope it would ever be both soft and manageable. Then I used this LATHER shampoo at Casa Munras in Monterey, CA and it was extraordinary. I ordered an 8oz bottle for myself when I got home. I really can&#x27;t imagine ever using something else. What makes it so great?</li>
    <li> I used this at a hotel in Carmel and loved it with the shampoo.  I had to order some when I got back.  Its so refreshing and natural for the hair.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> REALLY LIKE THE SHAMPOO</li>
    <li> got turned onto this as a hotel size shampoo. It&#x27;s gentle on hair, gives an incredible shine</li>
    <li> Great shampoo with extravagant lather and refreshing scent which wakes up the morning. Use sparingly as it creates huge amount of lather.</li>
    <li> Lather&#x27;s Mint Thyme Hair Wash has a fabulous scent.  It&#x27;s a great olfactory perceptual experience to wash my hair with it in the shower.  As a shampoo, however, I prefer other products.</li>
    <li> Received a sample bottle from my hotel after my lugguge was misplaced.  I liked it so much that I ordered two bottles.</li>
    <li> i stumbled across this line of haircare products in a hotel in rhode island.  they just make my fine and thin hair feel great.  moisturized enough, but not weighed down at all.  some of their products are SLS free.</li>
    <li> When staying at a hotel in San Francisco, I found this shampoo (among other items from the same company). It was absolutely perfect for getting a super clean feeling after a long day of cycling. This was my go-to shampoo for post-workout showers. I would still use it, but unfortunately my hair needs have changed and I no longer need shampoo. The scent is wonderful, too!</li>
