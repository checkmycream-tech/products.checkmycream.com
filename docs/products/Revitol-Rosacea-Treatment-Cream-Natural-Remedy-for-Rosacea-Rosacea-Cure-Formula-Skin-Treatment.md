### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was impressed</li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve ever used including prescription creams.</li>
      <li>Best product yet</li>
      <li>this rosacea cream is the best product that I&#x27;ve found for my rosacea</li>
      <li>Some will work best on others.</li>
      <li>Since rosacea includes spider veins on the cheeks and nose which greatly increases the redness, I wondered if this cream would help reduce the visible veins on my face.  </li>
      <li>Great for my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin looks great now.  </li>
      <li>amazon response great , however ,did not wait even 5 days when i recieved product.</li>

      <li>Will purchase more from this seller!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I really liked it and so did my skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cure it by any means - but the relief is ASTOUNDING.</li>
      <li>Make no mistake, this product is no cure and is not 100% effective in eliminating the affliction.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a nice face cream but</li>
      <li>Honestly.</li>
      <li>great Product, Used right away and helped soothe my face!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the results so far and would recommend this product.</li>
      <li>So far it is working great!!!!</li>
      <li>As for me this was a great purchase and it&#x27;s also a great moisturizer since Rosacea can dry your skin out.</li>
      <li>I have tried many creams to reduce my rosacea on my cheeks and this one worked within a week of using it.  </li>
      <li>I will use it until I find better</li>
      <li>Love this product but has a tendency to make my skin itch.</li>
      <li>I found using Jason&#x27;s  Aloe Vera OIl to be extremely more helpful.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford this every month even if it did work.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t even have to use foundation to cover the redness anymore &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>However , the benefits of its application were more noticeable over an extended period of time.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I was on the verge of discontinuing Revitol Rosecea cream, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I plan on ordering more of it when this jar is gone, using it strictly for my rosacea.  </li>
      <li>Very fast service and fair price.  </li>
      <li>Good product, reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It comes in a large, stylish, plastic, screw top jar holding a 2 fl oz (which is 4 tablespoons)</li>
      <li>Worked great cleared up all my redness but occasional dryness of the face</li>
      <li>I started putting a light coating of VariClear just on my cheeks and nose twice a day and started noticing a decrease in the spider veins on my cheeks.  </li>
      <li>but it significantly reduces redness,inflammation,soreness and sensitivity.  </li>
      <li>we are all unique and we need to try things out.</li>
      <li>A cream like this belongs in a tube to make it user friendly.</li>
      <li>My skin looks better than it has in 2 years after 2 months of consistent use.  </li>
      <li>I found something much better that really works for me.  </li>
      <li>cant say enough good things about this product</li>
      <li>The cream makes my skin more soft, smooth and mosturize.</li>
      <li>quick results....easy to use...</li>
      <li>really see a huge difference, bumps and pimple looking craters</li>
      <li>this would actually be worth it</li>
      <li>Far better than any prescription I&#x27;ve been given for rosacea.</li>
      <li>I am surprised on some of the reviews that it gave people more flareups??</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>My husband asked me what I was doing because he said my face was looking better, more like just rosy cheeks than heavily veined ones.  </li>
      <li>Ordered this for my son, he tells me it works for him, the shipping and the price of the cream very reasonable</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and item exactly as described!</li>
      <li>Revitol lessens the redness and keeps my skin soft and bump free all day.  </li>
      <li>Has really help my rosacea and flare ups rarely occur.  </li>
      <li>The cream seem to worsen my condition and made my skin even more oily, red and irritated.</li>
      <li>more red than ever</li>
      <li>and it made it more red.</li>
      <li>First product I found that really helps for Rosacea!</li>
      <li>started using this hoping it would give same results as hydrocortisone ,which thins face , and i had more breakouts , burning , ictching ,and redness.</li>
      <li>my skin is super sensitive</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had rosacea for around 4 years now, and in that whole time i&#x27;ve never had anything work as well as this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have suffered with Rosacea for years and paid so much for prescriptions from the Dr that did not work.  </li>
      <li>It seems very pricey.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say that the bright red broken capillaries around my nose have almost disappeared!</li>
      <li>and I really wanted to give customers a real review on this product.  </li>
      <li>Used as directed for many weeks, but no positive results whatsoever.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t work any better than any other cream in the drug store that cost a lot cheaper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is like many other creams and lotions:  </li>
      <li>Revitol Rosecea cream significantly reduced underlying pain discomfort and facial redness.</li>
      <li>about 6 months later after reading a review that said she kept using it even though she had flaking/dryness and after about a month noticed a significant difference.  </li>
      <li>I will say the cream arrived in the mail quickly; that was the only positive</li>
      <li>I really had high expectations from this product considering the price.</li>
      <li>I had mild to moderate Rosacea.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice face cream, non-oilly, gives a good base for makeup.</li>
      <li>The packaging is designed to misrepresent how much is inside, a very old marketing trick.</li>
      <li>It totally worked for me and is well worth the money when u r suffering from Rosacea.</li>
      <li>This cream is very mild and it calmed down the redness and bumps.</li>
      <li>This product has been of significant benefit in reducing the redness and rough patches that can be associated with rosacea.  </li>
      <li>Revitol has been working well, it&#x27;s definitely a new staple for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is the first rosacea product that actually works on getting rid of the redness on my face and keeping the &#x27;pimples&#x27; off of my face.  </li>
      <li>I honestly spent easily $1000 on different skin products over two years and nothing worked.  </li>
      <li>and i a huge waste of time and money.</li>
      <li>The directions for this product clearly state that it takes time for it to work, so as yet, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
      <li>Did nothing to clear up the rosacea.  </li>
      <li>This is the only product that really works.</li>
      <li>I used this for one month and there was no difference in the appearance of my rosacea, though it kept my skin soft.  </li>
      <li>I like it so far.  </li>
      <li>Not a cure, but daily use has really reduced the redness and bumps on my face.</li>
      <li>This product calms my extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
      <li>I am happy with the results, but if you ate looking for dramatic changes in a short amount of time, then get a different product.</li>
      <li>I will say when my skin was dry and irritated for the first 3-4 weeks, I would put a dab of Cerave lotion on those spots to keep the skin from cracking.  </li>
      <li>My wife was very excited and had high hopes of this helping her Rosacea but alas after using 3/4 of the not 1 day of improvement...</li>
      <li>i highly recommend it - am now on my second tub!!</li>
      <li>This was a drastic and shocking difference from the near perfect skin I had my whole life.  </li>
      <li>As long as I use it every day redness stays away and skin is clear.</li>
      <li>I actually took some before pictures of my eyes since I study behind the computer for many hours and don&#x27;t get enough rest.</li>
      <li>It really works to tone down the redness.</li>
      <li>Read all the reviews, good and bad hoping this cream would actually work, despite the not~so</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this cream often and it helps control my rosacea without hurting my skin.  I recommend it to all that have this skin problem.</li>
    <li> I always read customer reviews before purchasing products, and I did the same for Revitol Rosacea Cream. I began using this product a few days ago and I can honestly say that the bright red broken capillaries around my nose have almost disappeared! I fortunately do not have a terrible Rosacea problem, but I am definitely concerned enough to want to do what I can now to keep it at bay. I am very happy with the results so far and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So far it is working great!!!!</li>
    <li> no luck made the symptoms worse than before.  might work for someone but not for me.  don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I have rosacea really bad. my skin is super sensitive so I have to be careful what I put on it. This cream is very mild and it calmed down the redness and bumps. I am surprised on some of the reviews that it gave people more flareups?? we are all unique and we need to try things out. Some will work best on others. As for me this was a great purchase and it&#x27;s also a great moisturizer since Rosacea can dry your skin out. I really liked it and so did my skin.</li>
    <li> garbage.  it made my face even worst!!!!  more red than ever</li>
    <li> quick results....easy to use...shipment was immediate I would recommend this to any person with rosecea  cant say enough good things about this product</li>
    <li> I like it so far.  The package says to try for at least 30-60 days to see result so I&#x27;m still in the waiting period.  I do feel like it is working tho.</li>
    <li> I had mild to moderate Rosacea.  Bought this cream and used it for about 2 weeks.  My irritated skin was so dry and flaking I stopped using it.  I gave it another try about 6 months later after reading a review that said she kept using it even though she had flaking/dryness and after about a month noticed a significant difference.  So I tried it again and the same thing happened for about 3-4 weeks then my skin finally stopped peeling and flaking.  My skin looks better than it has in 2 years after 2 months of consistent use.  I love this stuff!  My nose/ chin were getting to the point that they were consistently red and irritated.  I had constant breakouts even though I had dry skin everywhere.  Every moisturizer I tried burned my skin and clogged my pores.  This was a drastic and shocking difference from the near perfect skin I had my whole life.  I honestly spent easily $1000 on different skin products over two years and nothing worked.  Even went to the dermatologist countless times, tried Azelaic acid, steroids, Finacea and that stuff all made my skin worse.  I will say when my skin was dry and irritated for the first 3-4 weeks, I would put a dab of Cerave lotion on those spots to keep the skin from cracking.  Used the Cerave lotion not the cream cause it clogged my pores.  Now my skin care regimen includes washing my face with Cerave moisturizing face wash not the foaming one, putting on Revitol, and after the Revitol absorbs if my skin is dry in any areas, a small dab of Cerave lotion.  My skin looks great now.  Will definitely continue buying Revitol it is a life saver.  You have to at least try this regimen.  It totally worked for me and is well worth the money when u r suffering from Rosacea.</li>
    <li> This is the first rosacea product that actually works on getting rid of the redness on my face and keeping the &#x27;pimples&#x27; off of my face.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the only cream I can use on my face (rosacea) that does not make my face burn and does not cause my eyes to burn.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Do not waste your money on this product. It did nothing to help and burned.</li>
    <li> I really had high expectations from this product considering the price. For all its hype it did not delver and I would recommend not  trying it unless you want your skin to dry out and flake. I found using Jason&#x27;s  Aloe Vera OIl to be extremely more helpful. It not only calmed my Rosacea but it softened my skin and put the moisture back to my face.</li>
    <li> JUST BOUGHT THIS LAST MONTH, STILL HAVE ABOUT HALF JAR LEFT, I USE ONE, OR TWO TIMES A DAY, FORGETTING A DAY OR TWO HERE AND THERE!&lt;br /&gt;I really see a huge difference, bumps and pimple looking craters are almost all gone, they are now hard to see without getting up real close, redness gone, bumpy craters shrinking big time,....&lt;br /&gt;going to buy another jar in just a minute!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
    <li> Good product, reasonable price. Not a cure, but daily use has really reduced the redness and bumps on my face.</li>
    <li> Honestly. I was on the verge of discontinuing Revitol Rosecea cream, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. After only a few weeks of using it , I was not very much impressed. However , the benefits of its application were more noticeable over an extended period of time. Revitol Rosecea cream significantly reduced underlying pain discomfort and facial redness. I would not hesitate to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost anything and everything. Laser worked but after a while became a bit pricey per session. You need to give this product a chance.. You will not see instant results. Twice a day for two months, then my face has improved 100%!!! I used to have severe rosacea with itching on my cheeks, after two months of use twice a day, my face has improved 100% and I don&#x27;t even have to use foundation to cover the redness anymore &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I actually took some before pictures of my eyes since I study behind the computer for many hours and don&#x27;t get enough rest. I had visible bags and one bottle of cream started to minimize my bags. I was impressed and I&#x27;m ordering my second jar.</li>
    <li> This is the second jar I have purchased. It calms my skin, takes away the redness and clears up the outbreak.</li>
    <li> Love this product but has a tendency to make my skin itch. Besides the cost of this product, that&#x27;s one of the cons of it.</li>
    <li> This product is supposed to diminish the redness of Rosaeca. Unfortunately, it turned my face more red. Rosacea can&lt;br /&gt;be different for each person. It takes lots of looking and trial and error. Hopefully, this works for others.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my son, he tells me it works for him, the shipping and the price of the cream very reasonable</li>
    <li> It really works to tone down the redness. As long as I use it every day redness stays away and skin is clear.</li>
    <li> Worked great cleared up all my redness but occasional dryness of the face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had rosacea for around 4 years now, and in that whole time i&#x27;ve never had anything work as well as this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t cure it by any means - but the relief is ASTOUNDING. I use it everyday, twice a day and the bumps are lessened, the redness has faded and the soreness is non-existant. i highly recommend it - am now on my second tub!!</li>
    <li> Did not even phase my Rosacea.  Bentonite Clay completely took it away within a few days!</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews, good and bad hoping this cream would actually work, despite the not~so~good reviews Oh was I totally  disappointed. Used this cream as specified for about 3 weeks and saw no improvement. The cream seem to worsen my condition and made my skin even more oily, red and irritated. I will say the cream arrived in the mail quickly; that was the only positive</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month. I apply it morning and night. I have noticed a difference in color and it did diminish the rosacea some. I am happy with the results, but if you ate looking for dramatic changes in a short amount of time, then get a different product.</li>
    <li> Make no mistake, this product is no cure and is not 100% effective in eliminating the affliction. The packaging is designed to misrepresent how much is inside, a very old marketing trick. It comes in a large, stylish, plastic, screw top jar holding a 2 fl oz (which is 4 tablespoons) much smaller jar with a cap that just lays on and soon becomes messy. A cream like this belongs in a tube to make it user friendly. It seems very pricey. It will tingle on inflamed areas, but that soon fades away. At the end, it does offer “some relief”, as the manufacturer explicitly promises, by reducing inflammation and pain with daily use, a rarity among other products that I have tried. I will use it until I find better and I have been looking quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with Rosacea for years and paid so much for prescriptions from the Dr that did not work.  This is the only product that really works.</li>
    <li> My wife was very excited and had high hopes of this helping her Rosacea but alas after using 3/4 of the not 1 day of improvement...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has tried the cheaper products and hoped for the $30 price tag this would actually be worth it but it was not and i a huge waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting this product to do for Rosacea but it doesn&#x27;t do anything. It&#x27;s just a nice face cream but it&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t  make the broken capillaries less noticeable or diminish the redness. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone suffering from&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea.</li>
    <li> started using this hoping it would give same results as hydrocortisone ,which thins face , and i had more breakouts , burning , ictching ,and redness. need to find another product, may work for some , but not me. amazon response great , however ,did not wait even 5 days when i recieved product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a cure but it significantly reduces redness,inflammation,soreness and sensitivity.  Best product I&#x27;ve ever used including prescription creams. Well worth the money. Currently on my 4th container.</li>
    <li> this rosacea cream is the best product that I&#x27;ve found for my rosacea</li>
    <li> Revitol has been working well, it&#x27;s definitely a new staple for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to those who have Rosacea.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will</li>
    <li> I tried it like they said,  didn&#x27;t work any better than any other cream in the drug store that cost a lot cheaper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered it, the way they put the order through, I didn&#x27;t think I ordered so-I ordered again.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as the orders were done &amp; I was charged $40. for the 2nd. Jar. I immediately canceled that&lt;br /&gt;2nd. order.  They sent it anyway with a charge of $.00 - however when my charge card papers&lt;br /&gt;Arrived their charge of $40. Was there!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and item exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Did nothing to clear up the rosacea.  It is a nice face cream, non-oilly, gives a good base for makeup.</li>
    <li> Far better than any prescription I&#x27;ve been given for rosacea.</li>
    <li> Not for me, it made my skin dry and it made it more red.It mmight work on others but not me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams to reduce my rosacea on my cheeks and this one worked within a week of using it.  The redness was dramatically reduced and it did not irritate my skin in that area.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product calms my extremely sensitive skin.  It is a solution which other off-the-shelf products cannot offer.  However, whether it would treat my scarred spots caused by rashes created by the previous skin care products, I think I would need to try it for a longer period to determine.</li>
    <li> I used this for one month and there was no difference in the appearance of my rosacea, though it kept my skin soft.  I found something much better that really works for me.  I ordered a jar of VariClear formulated to reduce appearance of varicose veins and spider veins on my legs.  Since rosacea includes spider veins on the cheeks and nose which greatly increases the redness, I wondered if this cream would help reduce the visible veins on my face.  I started putting a light coating of VariClear just on my cheeks and nose twice a day and started noticing a decrease in the spider veins on my cheeks.  My husband asked me what I was doing because he said my face was looking better, more like just rosy cheeks than heavily veined ones.  I have now used it twice a day for one month and the veins are half as visible as they were.  I plan on ordering more of it when this jar is gone, using it strictly for my rosacea.  There appears to be about a 4 month supply in one jar by just using it on my face.  Where the Revitol only lasts one month and it makes no difference in the spider veins.  Someone ought to start marketing VariClear for Rosacea.  Best product yet that I have found for that condition</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife who suffers from Rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;It does work, but leaves her face dry so she is not using it any more.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to get her to use moisturizer and Revitol but alas she will not.</li>
    <li> there is NO result whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;such a shame.&lt;br /&gt;To me it is like many other creams and lotions:  promises, promises, but no result at all!!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I have the acne rosacea.  My face gets so red with little, painful bumps. Makeup needed to be reapplied all the time - which only made it worse.  I have tried almost everything.  Revitol lessens the redness and keeps my skin soft and bump free all day.  Great for my skin.</li>
    <li> The directions for this product clearly state that it takes time for it to work, so as yet, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> This product is not for sensitive skin, it actually irritated my skin and made my Rosacea worse. Not for me.</li>
    <li> The cream makes my skin more soft, smooth and mosturize. I really love it and reccomendended to the people that suffers of rasacea.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to say, my Rosacea in general has its good days and bad days... For as expensive (and small) this cream is, I&#x27;d like better results, or at least not something I THINK is working.</li>
    <li> It did not work as expected.  Skin burned and Rosacea actually got worse.  I will try a different product.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Amazon because there were really no reviews on other internet sites and I really wanted to give customers a real review on this product.  I  used it consistantly and was expecting a miracle, but sorry, no miracle.  I did have a little bit less breakouts but not enough for me to buy it again.  Wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford this every month even if it did work.</li>
    <li> You have to keep using this daily for it to have a moderate effect...certainly no cure but does help some</li>
    <li> My rosacea is the worst its ever been in my life. It&#x27;s like I put acid on my face for the last two weeks. Do what ever you can to avoid it. I have literally had acid on my face when I was in the desert, and this stuff is worse.</li>
    <li> I got a breakout from this so had to discontinue after a few applications.</li>
    <li> No visible results, period. Used as directed for many weeks, but no positive results whatsoever. I will not recommend this product to anyone with rosacea. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product has been of significant benefit in reducing the redness and rough patches that can be associated with rosacea.  Wouldeccomend this item to those suffering from rosacea</li>
    <li> great Product, Used right away and helped soothe my face! First product I found that really helps for Rosacea! Will purchase more from this seller!</li>
    <li> Has really help my rosacea and flare ups rarely occur.  Very fast service and fair price.  I will use this service again.</li>
