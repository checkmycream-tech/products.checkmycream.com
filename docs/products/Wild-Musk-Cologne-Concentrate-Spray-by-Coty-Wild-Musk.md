      <li>smells just as good as the first time30 years ago.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to find Coty Wild Musk on the Amazon web-site.  </li>
      <li>but the cost to ship would have been more than it was worth.</li>
      <li>fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>I have LOVED Coty Wild Musk.  </li>
      <li>Soft ,smooth, clean, warm, sexy.  </li>
      <li>My first sexy cologne, so I was told.  </li>
      <li>Love wild musk  </li>
      <li>Why did they change and mess up such a beautiful scent!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>The NEW (rancid) formula is bottled in a smooth bottle with a similar box design except instead of a singular ribbon design, it is a &#x27;more modern&#x27;</li>
      <li>I was excited to recieve Wild Musk, however it does not compare to the original Wild Musk.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Please have your seller double check the bottle - smooth or ridged.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE Wild Musk Cologne for Women from Coty!!!  </li>

      <li>Soft clean smell that takes me back 30 years.  </li>
      <li>And the new formula is RANCID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is more powdery than usual and</li>
      <li>When I first opened it and sniffed it, I was suspicious that there was something different about the smell.</li>
      <li>I am extremely sensitive to colognes, but I can wear this without fear of reaction.  </li>
      <li>I compared it to my other original bottle with a little left over in it, and confirmed right then that the smell in the new bottle was definitely not the same as before.</li>
      <li>20 years of receiving daily compliments from complete strangers to ...... nothing.  </li>
      <li>hopefully my next bottle will be back to normal again.</li>
      <li>I have been a long time fan and wearer of Coty Wild Musk for Women Spray Cologne.  </li>
      <li>Seems to have a different scent at first, but realized that it softens out after a few minutes because it is a concentrate.</li>

<li> /&gt;The OLD/ORIGINAL formula was bottled in a ridged/ribbed bottle with a box design of a singular ribbon flowing down.  </li>

<li> I could care less about the packaging ...</li>

<li> This is a brand that&#x27;s hard to find in the stores</li>

<li> The smell was not pleasant</li>
<li> This is false advertising, please do not fall prey to this scheme.</li>
<li> They&#x27;ve changed their formula ... and it literally stinks!  </li>
<li> I emailed Coty about &amp;#34;Dark Vanilla&amp;#34; that they no longer sell, they recommended this as an alternative, but it was just awful!</li>

    <li> Since junior high school in the 1980&#x27;s I have LOVED Coty Wild Musk.  This is the first bottle of Wild Musk I have ever bought that smells different!  :(  It is more powdery than usual and though the scent seems to last longer throughout the day, I don&#x27;t like the scent, so it&#x27;s no good.  I hope that Coty didn&#x27;t change their formula on me!!  Total bummer but I guess after 27 years, I can&#x27;t complain...hopefully my next bottle will be back to normal again.</li>
    <li> not the same as what i grew up with. this was my scent. not any longer. it actually gave me a rash! threw it away.</li>
    <li> It seems to me that this product is either a knock off, or they messed with the scent. When I first opened it and sniffed it, I was suspicious that there was something different about the smell. I compared it to my other original bottle with a little left over in it, and confirmed right then that the smell in the new bottle was definitely not the same as before. I had my husband do a smell test and he agreed...disappointing!</li>
    <li> Seems to have a different scent at first, but realized that it softens out after a few minutes because it is a concentrate.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for decades. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this scent for many years and have had a lot of compliments.  Refreshing aroma ~ not a flowery scent..</li>
    <li> I emailed Coty about &amp;#34;Dark Vanilla&amp;#34; that they no longer sell, they recommended this as an alternative, but it was just awful! The smell was not pleasant and I couldn&#x27;t return it because it was perfume.</li>
    <li> Happy buyer .... Thanks</li>
    <li> i always loved  this perfume  was to replace my empty bottle</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find Coty Wild Musk on the Amazon web-site.  I have worn this scent for over 30 years, and as the years extend, it is getting more difficult to find.  Even my local Walgreen&#x27;s no longer carries it.  I am extremely sensitive to colognes, but I can wear this without fear of reaction.  I hope it is not being fazed out.</li>
    <li> smells just as good as the first time30 years ago.  Perhaps a little weaker, still one of my old time favorites</li>
    <li> GREAT FRAGRANCE&lt;br /&gt;NEED MORE ALREADY</li>
    <li> I used to wear this cologne all the time...I know it was discontinued, but when I saw it on Amazon...I thought GREAT!  When I got it and put it on...it was rancid. I would have sent it back but the cost to ship would have been more than it was worth.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. If I ever haunt someone they&#x27;ll know it was me.</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite scent. Most give her a headache but she can wear this&lt;br /&gt;Just fine!</li>
    <li> I have loved the smell of this for long time and very happy they still make it</li>
    <li> We purchased many bottles for gifting and for ourselves. Love the product nice alluring sent.</li>
    <li> This has been a favorite of mine for decades. It has stood the test of time.</li>
    <li> excellent product for the price...</li>
    <li> My first sexy cologne, so I was told.  It has been since the 80&#x27;s that the memory never went away. Soft ,smooth, clean, warm, sexy.  You will be asked &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34; and were can I find it.</li>
    <li> have used it 20 years- love it</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes.  This is a brand that&#x27;s hard to find in the stores and I was so happy Amazon carried it.  I thought the price was excellent.</li>
    <li> Item that arrived IS NOT what I ordered and is \\&quot;not returnable\\&quot;. I received a different cologne made by the same company, but it is not what I want. Hoping amazon customer service can help. Based on this experience, I DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM. This is false advertising, please do not fall prey to this scheme.</li>
    <li> This was purchase as a birthday gift, she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time fan and wearer of Coty Wild Musk for Women Spray Cologne.  Over two decades!  A few years back, I noticed a package change.  I sprayed on the cologne and ... ohhhh ... it literally stank!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OLD/ORIGINAL formula was bottled in a ridged/ribbed bottle with a box design of a singular ribbon flowing down.  The NEW (rancid) formula is bottled in a smooth bottle with a similar box design except instead of a singular ribbon design, it is a &#x27;more modern&#x27; (I guess) design with a splash of color.  I could care less about the packaging ... it&#x27;s what&#x27;s in the bottle that counts!  And the new formula is RANCID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 20 years of receiving daily compliments from complete strangers to ...... nothing.  I&#x27;m embarrassed to wear it!  It smells like a man&#x27;s cologne now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE Wild Musk Cologne for Women from Coty!!!  They&#x27;ve changed their formula ... and it literally stinks!  (*sigh*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, please contact sellers before purchase as they tend to use stock photos.  I have been scouring the internet (after getting a snippy, snide remark from Coty) trying to find and purchase their OLD/ORIGINAL formula.  If I don&#x27;t ask the sellers directly about whether their bottles are smooth or ridged, just going by their stock photo, I would have a pile of useless rancid junk!  Please have your seller double check the bottle - smooth or ridged.  Hopefully, Coty doesn&#x27;t catch on and start bottling their new stinky crap into old style bottles!!!)</li>
    <li> fantastic product.  It does not overpower like many musk oils.  Men love the scent.  I love it because it smells great but also because it does not bother my allergies.</li>
    <li> Came on time.  I was excited to recieve Wild Musk, however it does not compare to the original Wild Musk.  I wish the company would go back to the original recipe women would line up to buy it.  Any one who remembers what it smelled like, this one didn&#x27;t smell good on my skin.</li>
    <li> Most excellent!  Soft clean smell that takes me back 30 years.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Time to reorder my signature fragrance!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, as for me it is ok,  I have purchased it an I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Love wild musk  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Love it!  The only scent that does not bother my Asthma...and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift to my friend who has been wearing this scent for years.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume of all time, not flowery and it is always sold out in my small town.  People always say I smell so good and ask what I am wearing.</li>
    <li> Why did they change and mess up such a beautiful scent!!!!!!! It still smells good...but not as good..nor does the scent last as long!!!</li>
