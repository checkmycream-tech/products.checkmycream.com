      <li>I had hoped to get this in order to transfer my contents over and be able to see what was in the bag without having to fumble around.</li>

      <li>(So I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;hiding&amp;#34; anything at work.)&lt;br /&gt;Quality seems good and sturdy so far.  </li>
      <li>I had to come up with a small see thru bag to carry into work and this was the perfect choice.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a very cheap quality and not as large as it should be.</li>
      <li>No matter how clean your home, &#x27;critters&#x27; can invade your cabinets.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s them breath and keeps them clean.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  </li>
      <li>Good basic mesh makeup bag.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a full 2 stars.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and the handle makes it easy to carry while leaving your hands free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never found another one that&#x27;s just the right size, fits all my cosmetics, yet still fits comfortably inside my purse, like this one is.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my current one for 6 years, but this one has had to endure much more, because I travel more now than I used to.</li>
      <li>shampoo, conditioner, body-wash right in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Great size, drys quickly.</li>
      <li>Not as big as I would have liked</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
      <li>I have a larger mesh bag I use for traveling and find it really useful to be able to see what&#x27;s inside at a glance, rather than having to dig around.</li>
      <li>This is great for packing my beauty blender makeup applicators (I have 3 large and 2 small) in when I travel.</li>
      <li>gave it 4 stars because it fits what I was looking for pretty well (80-85%)</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I had the first version of this bag for 8 years.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend if the size if right for you.</li>
      <li>I had a hard time finding a mesh bag that would be good for the gym.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s held up very well.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s much more sturdy and well-made than I would have expected.</li>
      <li>I really like this</li>
      <li>Roaches live everywhere, and you have no way of knowing where they have traveled...including your toothbrush!</li>
      <li>Mommy Makeup Black Mesh Bag has just filled that need!</li>
      <li>Because it is a black net I am able to quickly locate whatever I need.</li>
      <li>The zipper is also decent.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Mommy Makeup, a person now has a very well made mesh bag that will serve multiple uses!</li>
      <li>It had to be large enough for the spin brush I use, ventilated while not allowing insects access inside</li>
      <li>This bag is large enough and it is well made.  </li>
      <li>Glossy vinyl trim looks a little cheap.</li>
      <li>This bag is cheaply put together and a waste of money at that.  </li>
      <li>I especially like the mesh; it really helps find what you want.  </li>
      <li>I have been carrying around a ten year old Trish McEvoy bag that was never quite large enough.  </li>
      <li>I use this to hold extra makeup that I don&#x27;t normally use every day.</li>
      <li>This bag is exactly what I needed for all of the little makeup items that I take with me everywhere I go.</li>

<li> This bag is exactly what I needed for all of the little makeup items that I take with me everywhere I go.</li>
<li> It is actually just barely 2 inches wide (not quite) and 4 inches by 8 inches.</li>
<li> I love that it is see through and that it wont get dirty like the others ones that are not mesh.  </li>
<li> And it&#x27;s a bit too long for</li>
<li> smaller than expected</li>
<li> The other star because the zipper actually works.</li>
<li> so the brush can air dry so as to not create an environment for mildew/mold, closeable while still allowing air to pass through.</li>
<li> Simple little bag for essentials taken to the gym.  </li>
<li> Just be careful with it.</li>
<li> A total  waste of money.</li>
<li> The edges are a bit stiff and flexible and can&#x27;t be totally straightened out.</li>
<li> It is smaller than I expected and it is not nicely shaped like in the advertised photograph.</li>
<li> Had it for less than a month before the zipper broke.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;m just disappointed it&#x27;s not the right size and doesn&#x27;t stand like in the picture but is a crushed, lopsided thing.</li>
<li> I wanted a bag to hold my phone and a wallet or a few small items during my shift.&lt;br /&gt;I picked this bag because it&#x27;s semi-see-through - and because it&#x27;s mesh rather than plastic</li>
<li> What I received was a small 7.5&amp;#34; bag and NOT 9&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
<li> small but sturdy cosmetics bag.  </li>
<li> Even if I put my things a little wet in there, it has the mesh outside that will still help them dry without getting nasty!</li>
<li> I was afraid that it would be too big or too small</li>
<li> Poor quality product.  </li>
<li> I bought this bag to hold my makeup because I was tired of digging around to find what I needed.  </li>
<li> False advertising...</li>
<li> I have to say I was shocked at what I received after reading the other reviews.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> perfect for what I needed</li>
    <li> Poor quality product.  Returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> Good basic mesh makeup bag. Glossy vinyl trim looks a little cheap. I have a larger mesh bag I use for traveling and find it really useful to be able to see what&#x27;s inside at a glance, rather than having to dig around.</li>
    <li> I have been carrying around a ten year old Trish McEvoy bag that was never quite large enough.  This bag is large enough and it is well made.  Because it is a black net I am able to quickly locate whatever I need.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice bag.  Prompt service.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Love that I can see into the bag without having to dig through it.  I only wish the mesh was silver...like the one I lost.</li>
    <li> A total  waste of money. I purchased it because of the size. What I received was a small 7.5&amp;#34; bag and NOT 9&amp;#34; as advertised. False advertising... and the sender should be ashamed.. I have zero use for this size...extremely disappointed !!!!! I want a refund.</li>
    <li> No matter how clean your home, &#x27;critters&#x27; can invade your cabinets. One of the most important things to do for your health is brush your teeth....next just might be to protect your toothbrush from unwanted &#x27;critters&#x27;! Roaches live everywhere, and you have no way of knowing where they have traveled...including your toothbrush! I have searched for a container to hold my toothbrush when not in use. It had to be large enough for the spin brush I use, ventilated while not allowing insects access inside so the brush can air dry so as to not create an environment for mildew/mold, closeable while still allowing air to pass through. Mommy Makeup Black Mesh Bag has just filled that need! While this bag is sold as used for makeup, it will serve a much needed purpose of protecting one of the most important appliances you will ever use, your toothbrush! Thanks to Mommy Makeup, a person now has a very well made mesh bag that will serve multiple uses! Their bag is the only bag I could find on the internet to fill my needs. Next time you use your toothbrush, consider a Mommy Bag! Your gums will thank you!</li>
    <li> I had the first version of this bag for 8 years.  It finally shredded so I retired it and got another one.  I&#x27;ve had my current one for 6 years, but this one has had to endure much more, because I travel more now than I used to. It&#x27;s has started to separate at the seam. I&#x27;m now replacing it with the same bag again.  I&#x27;ve never found another one that&#x27;s just the right size, fits all my cosmetics, yet still fits comfortably inside my purse, like this one is.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> small but sturdy cosmetics bag.  this would be ideal for lipsticks or eyeliner pencils, maybe tubes of BB cream.</li>
    <li> I love this bag.  This is my 4th one.  I also use this bag for my electronic gear.  Great quality product.</li>
    <li> Had it for less than a month before the zipper broke.  This bag is cheaply put together and a waste of money at that.  Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Bag is a gift so I have not used it, but it appears to be of good quality, and looks as if it will hold up well.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was shocked at what I received after reading the other reviews. I had a toiletry bag the same size as this only not see thru mesh. I had hoped to get this in order to transfer my contents over and be able to see what was in the bag without having to fumble around. That&#x27;s just not going to happen as this bag is not the stated dimensions. It is actually just barely 2 inches wide (not quite) and 4 inches by 8 inches. It is smaller than I expected and it is not nicely shaped like in the advertised photograph. The edges are a bit stiff and flexible and can&#x27;t be totally straightened out. Sure it will hold things and that will fill out the shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a full 2 stars. One star for having good quality mesh. The other star because the zipper actually works. Otherwise it&#x27;s a very cheap quality and not as large as it should be. I&#x27;ll find another use for it but I&#x27;m just disappointed it&#x27;s not the right size and doesn&#x27;t stand like in the picture but is a crushed, lopsided thing. I took pictures with a ruler beside it but Amazon only allows for a video it seems, not individual photos.</li>
    <li> Solidly made and a convenient size. Bought the zippered bag for my wife - as her kit - to hold her wallet,  pens, pads .... She can grab it and go</li>
    <li> This makeup bag is of perfect size to carry in my  bag. Plus, I can see what is inside and easily find whatever piece I need. I love it.</li>
    <li> The bag is very nice. I especially like the mesh; it really helps find what you want.  In my dream world the bag would be about 1&amp;#34; taller.  But still, I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get a lot of good use from it.</li>
    <li> handy handle and size. a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time finding a mesh bag that would be good for the gym.  This one met my needs perfectly!</li>
    <li> This is great for packing my beauty blender makeup applicators (I have 3 large and 2 small) in when I travel. Let&#x27;s them breath and keeps them clean.</li>
    <li> I got this bag actually to hold my exfolinating gloves and sponge when I travel or need to put them away.&lt;br /&gt;It fits my things perfectly! Even if I put my things a little wet in there, it has the mesh outside that will still help them dry without getting nasty!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my upcoming travels. It fits all my TSA approved personal care items and looks great to.</li>
    <li> Ater searching for months to find a simple bag, this is perfect make up bag.  it holds everything I need and fits in my handbag perfectly.</li>
    <li> I use this bag for travel.  It keeps my things contained, but yet I can still see my things through the mesh.</li>
    <li> Simple little bag for essentials taken to the gym.  The contents stay free of excess moisture.  Smooth zipper and compact size.</li>
    <li> This bag is exactly what I needed for all of the little makeup items that I take with me everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my need. I like that it&#x27;s light and you can see what&#x27;s inside.</li>
    <li> i purchased this to use when showering at the gym/pool after a workout. It is perfect to take&lt;br /&gt; shampoo, conditioner, body-wash right in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Great size, drys quickly. Handy hook for hanging. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I really like this, it&#x27;s much more sturdy and well-made than I would have expected. Highly recommend if the size if right for you.</li>
    <li> I work at a grocery store location that does not allow purses on the floor during work.  I have a locker for my purse &amp; jacket.  I wanted a bag to hold my phone and a wallet or a few small items during my shift.&lt;br /&gt;I picked this bag because it&#x27;s semi-see-through - and because it&#x27;s mesh rather than plastic (more flexible than a plastic bag in my opinion).  (So I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;hiding&amp;#34; anything at work.)&lt;br /&gt;Quality seems good and sturdy so far.  Zipper could be better (in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;A good size.  I was afraid that it would be too big or too small but it&#x27;s just right.  The handle/loop is not quite big enough to put on my wrist though.  And it&#x27;s a bit too long for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it fits what I was looking for pretty well (80-85%) but it&#x27;s not 100% what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  Buy it, you will understand!</li>
    <li> Good quality mesh bag. I use this to hold extra makeup that I don&#x27;t normally use every day. The zipper is also decent. Just be careful with it.</li>
    <li> Not as big as I would have liked but it makes me not bring everything I own which is a problem I have.  I love that it is see through and that it wont get dirty like the others ones that are not mesh.  I do like this a lot and its great for the price.</li>
    <li> I had to come up with a small see thru bag to carry into work and this was the perfect choice. Big enough for my wallet, keys, chap stick, and phone. Very sturdy and the handle makes it easy to carry while leaving your hands free.</li>
    <li> We got this months ago to hold silverware for our camping trips. It&#x27;s held up very well. I might buy another for the same purpose.</li>
    <li> I bought this bag to hold my makeup because I was tired of digging around to find what I needed.  I like the color, size, and shape.  It seems to be holding up well.  I could have done without the patent leather handle though; it makes it look cheap.</li>
    <li> smaller than expected</li>
    <li> i can finally find my tweezers when I need them. love the bag and the material because I can find anything now&lt;br /&gt;5/17/13 - update&lt;br /&gt;the strap ripped and it&#x27;s only hanging by a thread now. oh well. good while it lated!</li>
