      <li>love it and my hubby does too!!</li>
      <li>My favorite!!</li>
      <li>I have never been very happy with most perfumes.</li>
      <li>and I started spraying myself with it because I loved it.</li>
      <li>I like the original princess scent the best .</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe anyone would want to wear this cheap smelling junk!!  </li>
      <li>I have liked this ever since it came out years ago.</li>
      <li>My father and uncle even agree that it is nice.</li>
      <li>great fresh scent.. lasts all day!</li>
      <li>It also has a really great smell to it and Amazon was really quick with the delivery of the product.</li>
      <li>It was for a great price and it was right on time.</li>
      <li>Princess, though I am not a big fan of the name, is the perfect scent for me.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume...</li>
      <li>I received a free sample, liked it, and so I purchased a bottle.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments from people on this</li>
      <li>It reminds me of 15cent and 20cent cologne I used to be able to buy from dime stores when I was in grammar school.  </li>
      <li>LOVE ..</li>
      <li>I LOVE this perfume.</li>
      <li>LOVE ..</li>
      <li>This price was fantastic!</li>
      <li>it was lovely....</li>
      <li>LOVE ..</li>
      <li>I have just purchased Truly Pink,  also a wonderful fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I also have other Vera wang perfumes and they are wonderful..  </li>
      <li>Received it quick in the mail too!</li>
      <li>Love it, sweet and soft, does not smell too strong!!</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t huge perfume fans.</li>
      <li>It was over the holidays though and for the price it was worth it!</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>I got mine directly from Macy&#x27;s and it smelled more like a knockof...</li>
      <li>At best, if it isn&#x27;t stale, I would guess it is suppose to be an extremely sweet perfume.  </li>
      <li>They are often too overwhelming or have harsh aspects, which is why I have gone mostly perfume-free over the years.</li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced</li>
      <li>Looks to be an original, brand new in box.</li>
      <li>...hope hers smelled like the first time I smelled it on a promotional card...</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I enjoy it because its a sweet and non-overwelming fragrance perfect for everyday or even a casual date.</li>
      <li>I have Sheer Veil, and it is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>very alcohol-y</li>
      <li>So, if you are lucky enough to get a bottle that is fresh, and you love to sickening sweet smell then this will be your perfume, otherwise, if you prefer a more grown up sophisticated smell, then stay away from this one.</li>
      <li>I assume it is the authentic perfume by Vera Wang, but after reading some other reviews from buyers of this perfume, now I am wondering.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is light and sweet ..not too heavy or musky.</li>
      <li>I only use one spritz at a time and it&#x27;s just right.</li>
      <li>Please note it comes in a clear bottle, so you should keep it out of sunlight.</li>
      <li>Not too heavy and not too sweet.  </li>

<li> Not too heavy and not too sweet.  </li>
<li> This, however, has the smell of chemical, or alcohol or a really old bottle of perfume that has been sitting around for a few years.  </li>
<li> It is delicate, soft, feminine, and flowery.</li>
<li> Actually, some of them at least had the smell of an actual flower,  </li>
<li> It took as little longer than expected.</li>
<li> Well, if I could give this product less than one star, I would.  </li>
<li> Needless to say, it will go back to the store.  </li>
<li> But this--Princess is unusable and hard to convey the smell.  </li>
<li> It is just hard to describe how bad this stuff smells.  </li>
<li> Perfume has gotten so expensive , I shopped around.  </li>

    <li> love it and my hubby does too!!</li>
    <li> Well, I didn&#x27;t buy this from amazon, I purchased mine from Kmart on line.  Same packaging as shown here inside and out.  I assume it is the authentic perfume by Vera Wang, but after reading some other reviews from buyers of this perfume, now I am wondering.  Well, if I could give this product less than one star, I would.  I can&#x27;t believe anyone would want to wear this cheap smelling junk!!  I also have other Vera wang perfumes and they are wonderful..  I have Sheer Veil, and it is fabulous.  I have just purchased Truly Pink,  also a wonderful fragrance.  Not too heavy and not too sweet.  But this--Princess is unusable and hard to convey the smell.

    <li> That&#x27;s how the scent makes me feel and everyone who hugs me hold on a bit longer. I luv it!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume... I like the original princess scent the best . I get so many compliments from people on this scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and sweet ..not too heavy or musky.</li>
    <li> Looks to be an original, brand new in box. My favorite!!</li>
    <li> I had stolen this perfume from my daughter after smelling it on her.  When it was all gone, I decided to buy another.  Perfume has gotten so expensive , I shopped around.  This price was fantastic! And it arrived in two days! Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Love it, sweet and soft, does not smell too strong!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfriend for christmas and she loves it. It also has a really great smell to it and Amazon was really quick with the delivery of the product. I was highly impressed. It was for a great price and it was right on time.</li>
    <li> Like usual...who knows/...no comment from the recipient!!!!  I got mine directly from Macy&#x27;s and it smelled more like a knockof...very alcohol-y...hope hers smelled like the first time I smelled it on a promotional card...it was lovely....sigh...</li>
    <li> Very reasonably priced</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume. I went to Kohls and they had it on display and I started spraying myself with it because I loved it. I was almost about to spend $60 on a 1.7 oz bottle and then I thought wellll let me check Amazon.. I got this perfume for 45 bucks and it was a 3.7 oz bottle I believe.. LOVE .. LOVE .. LOVE .. great fresh scent.. lasts all day! Received it quick in the mail too!</li>
    <li> It took as little longer than expected. It was over the holidays though and for the price it was worth it!</li>
    <li> I did not have any problems with my order. It was shipped to me when they said it would be here.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, smells great!</li>
    <li> I have liked this ever since it came out years ago. I love the smell and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Given to granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves the smell of Vera Wang Princess. I enjoy it because its a sweet and non-overwelming fragrance perfect for everyday or even a casual date. My father and uncle even agree that it is nice. They aren&#x27;t huge perfume fans.</li>
    <li> I have never been very happy with most perfumes. They are often too overwhelming or have harsh aspects, which is why I have gone mostly perfume-free over the years. Princess, though I am not a big fan of the name, is the perfect scent for me. I received a free sample, liked it, and so I purchased a bottle. How do you describe a scent? It is delicate, soft, feminine, and flowery. I only use one spritz at a time and it&#x27;s just right. Please note it comes in a clear bottle, so you should keep it out of sunlight.</li>
