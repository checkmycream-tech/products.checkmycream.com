<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a really wonderful cream.  It is not greasy, absorbs quickly, and leaves your face glowing the next morning.  I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and have been using it for a long time and often buy it as gifts for friends.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few years. It&#x27;s not rich/thick enough for night. But I love it for my day moisturizer. I put it on every morning before my sunscreen and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion at bed time, on my face and neck, love the way it feels, keeps my skin looking good. A little bit goes a long way. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best affordable night cream I have ever used. I am pregnant and was looking for something more on the &#x27;natural&#x27; side, which is how I cam across this one. I have tried LOTS of different night creams and this is the one I will stick with. I love it. It smells good and feels good.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is a natural product however wasn&#x27;t happy with the scent. The scent just had a weird smell to it!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I have extremely sensitive skin and have not had any issues. Also, many fragrances give me migraine headaches, and still no problems. This does have a pretty strong smell, but it&#x27;s a pleasant one. I would recommend this product to anyone.    I&#x27;m not exactly sure what the difference between this and the day cream is, since they look and smell the same and do the same thing for my skin. However, they make my skin look fantastic, so I&#x27;ll keep using them.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great. it smells good and makes your skin look amazing in the morning. i use it before bed usually, after i wash my face of course. i don&#x27;t recommend daily use but a few nights a week really does the trick.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. I really like this product. If you have very oily skin or acne, it may not be for you. But I really like the way it makes my skin feel. No problems with break outs. I think it may even be helping the fine lines to fade. Will continue to use this product! Oh, and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this night cream. It&#x27;s very hydrating without breaking out my skin. The smell is a very light fragrant smell, and not too overpowering. This is definitely my go-to night cream. My skin looks so fresh and hydrated when I wake up.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t  tried this cream before but figured why not?  So now will not use anything else at night.  Its  a perfect mate for the daytime radiance cream.  Feels so good on your skin.</li>
    <li> This caused my face to have pimple-like  break out within two weeks of continuous use. Areas effected were my lower eyelids, nose and forehead. I occasionally have had Perioral dermatitis around my mouth but using this cream has caused it to spread to other areas for the first time. I believe the cream is too heavy which is a common cause of this facial rash. I stopped using it and apply some tea tree oil for a few days and the rash is now subsiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry and sensitive skin, I do not recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> Goes a long way, I use it every night and it&#x27;s light weight and feels good going on.  The best part is my face actually has a beautiful and healthful glow when I apply it.  It&#x27;s awesome to look and feel so good without makeup on.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream. it&#x27;s a little thick but i love using it for night. keeps my face hydrated.</li>
    <li> Overall, I really like this night cream.  It goes on smooth, has a nice scent, and keeps me moisturized. The only significant thing I have to contribute with this product review is that I have an interaction with it when used with benzoyl peroxide.  Occasionally, I will apply this night cream first and follow up with Neutrogena On-the-Spot (2.5% benzoyl peroxide) to prevent / help breakouts.  Each time I combine the two, I will get a sunburn-like inflammation in the spots where I apply the benzoyl peroxide (enough that my co-workers ask if I went to the beach over the weekend). I only have this reaction when using it along with this moisturizer (it&#x27;s been fine with other moisturizers in the past and when by itself) so I must assume one of the ingredients interacts.  So anyway, this is just something to keep in mind when buying this product. I still like it and use it regularly.  Also, if anyone knows an ingredient that could cause this, please comment and let me know...I am curious. :)</li>
    <li> Amazing!  My skin feels soft and moisturized.  It also seems to be making a difference in scars and dark spots!</li>
    <li> I think this product rocks!!!! I&#x27;m new at this \\&quot;moisturizing world\\&quot; and after using this product for almost 3 months now I can honestly see a great improvement in my skin. But at first I didn&#x27;t, it just takes consistence and patience. My forehead lines are almost nonexistent and my face is much more evenly toned! Seriously can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in 6 months!!! Anyway I&#x27;m going to try burts bees eye cream hope its just as good! :)</li>
    <li> buy for my wife, she said &amp;#34;that&#x27;s very good&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I think Burt&#x27;s Bees changed their ingredients.  The night cream does not provide the moisture that it once did.  It was excellent.  Now it is adequate.</li>
    <li> I do not actually like this as a night cream since it started to make me break out; however, I have recently realized that it does a great job moisturizing hands and helping to heal wounds faster. I don&#x27;t know if this could be contributed to the moisturizing effect or something else.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are the best!</li>
    <li> It smells good and feels great on my face and neck.  It doesn&#x27;t stay greasy on my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and neck and it&#x27;s perfect for winter when my skin seems to dry out.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this, the ageless night cream and the beeswax night cream. This moisture cream is going to perminently replace my oil of Olay night cream. I am a new convert to Burts. Great skin without the chemicals! I alternate this with the Ageless (which tightens). I also use the beeswax in small amounts after a facial steam. it really keeps the moisture in. All Burts night creams are great, priced right, and no \\&quot;funny stuff\\&quot; on your face!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Burt&#x27;s Bees products for several years as they are affordable and of good quality. I recently purchased new jar of the Radiance Night Cream and they have changed the formula. It is less creamy, but more importantly they changed the scent. To me, it smells like an ashtray. I guess I have to find a new brand of cream. Does anyone have any suggestions?</li>
    <li> 11-10-2011 Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit it was quite difficult to find a good replacement for the Burt&#x27;s Bees Night Creme(original formula), but after trying several brands in the past few months there were two that stood out above the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. [[ASIN:B001AMBAIS La Roche-Posay Toleriane Riche Soothing Protective Facial Cream, 1.35-Ounce]]: This product is the closest to Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Night Creme(original formula) that I could find.  In some ways, this product is superior(ie even thinner and lighter than burts bees and absorbs faster), but the cost is very high $21+ for 1.35oz. The ingredients in this product rates insanely well for being safe-to-use at EWG Cosmetic website, so if cost isn&#x27;t an issue for you this product is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. [[ASIN:B000052YMR Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream, 3.0 - Ounces Tube (Pack of 3)]]: This product is my recommended alternative. Although this product is not as fluid as the Burt&#x27;s Bees Night Creme(original formula), it has all the essential characteristics: non-greasy, easy to apply, absorbs quickly, feels light on the skin, and no scent+++! Also, the ingredients in this product is rated very well(safe-to-use) at EWG Cosmetic Website. Lastly, I think it is important to note that the price is amazing!; Amazon sells the 3oz(3-pack) for only ~$16!.  A lot of local stores carry this product, go try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------End of 11-10-2011 Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed to find out that Burt&#x27;s Bees had changed their Night Creme to a new formula while using almost identical packaging(I actually set the old and new packaging side-to-side to compare). I have enjoyed using Burt&#x27;s Bees Night Creme for more than 3 years, but this new formula feels almost like a completely different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my comparison of Burt&#x27;s Bees Night Creme Original vs New Formula:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Formula:&lt;br /&gt;+ Non-Greasy&lt;br /&gt;+ Absorbs Very Quickly&lt;br /&gt;+ Feels light on the skin(texture of creme is almost water-like)&lt;br /&gt;+ Very light smell that fades away very quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Formula:&lt;br /&gt;- Greasy(does not feel good when applied on face)&lt;br /&gt;- Does not absorb quickly(probably because it&#x27;s greasy)&lt;br /&gt;- Does not feel light(texture of creme feels thick and uneasy to apply)&lt;br /&gt;- An overly sweet &amp; strong smell(personally I think the smell is very strong, unnaturally sweet, and an abomination)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;New improvements or additions to a product can be very beneficial, but it seems like Burt&#x27;s Bees has changed this product completely. Burt&#x27;s Bees has completely lost sight of the fundamental characteristics that makes this product unique, and even more disappointing is their decision to use the same packaging for a different product.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I have acne prone skin, so I was concerned about what type of night cream to get.  After about 2 weeks of regular use I have not had a problem with breakouts or feeling overly oily (A different type of night cream had me breaking out after just a few days). The Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Night Cream has a light scent, goes on smoothly, and seems to be doing what a moisturizer should do!</li>
    <li> WAY too much fragrance in this product. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t do well with highly fragranced products. A lot of the other reviews talked up the fragrance, that it was natural and luxury. I don&#x27;t think it is.</li>
    <li> Recently, I decided to slowly switch all of my beauty creams to brands that contain fewer chemicals and more natural ingredients. (The older I get, the more natural I become ;&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I finished my jar of Borghese night cream I headed to our local Whole Foods beauty section to find a new product. They carry Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but I ended up buying at Target, where the price for this night cream was lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after cleansing my face in the evening, I applied a thin layer of Radiance night cream, bringing it up close under the eyes, and even over the whole eyelid.  I liked the feel (non-greasy, non-sticky) and the scent (very mild, and fades quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of this routine, I noticed a softness and nice glow to my skin in the morning. Also, there was no irritation of any kind, even around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with these results, and plan to try other products in the Burt&#x27;s Bees line.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells horrible!!! like cigarette scented face cream...so gross! not to mention it is too thick and oily ...not good for oily skin types.</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Night Creme.  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that gets my very dry, sensitive skin through Chicago winters.  And you can&#x27;t beat Burt&#x27;s Bees when it comes to a great natural product.  Good to my skin + good to animals &#x3D; A+++ in my book!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is rich and creamy for all night moisturizing. Leaves my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for about 3 months.  This is my second jar.  Seems to be doing a good job on my skin.  My complexion seems more radiant and the fine lines have lessened.</li>
    <li> I love this for night time. It really hydrates my skin. I use it for under my eyes and it is so soothing. I have had it for about 4 months now and I am barely half way through the jar. Only because I use it under my eyes. But I love it! And it smells clean too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this product gets such good reviews. I bought it with such high hopes but in 3 days my face had broken out and my lines looked deeper! Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I used this product last night. When I woke up I couldn&#x27;t believe most of my pimples and acne was gone! I think the jojoba oil helped my acne prone skin.  I gave fore out of five stars because I felt it needed more something. Once I apply this I applied the Burt&#x27;s Bees bee wax night cream on top of it. The bee wax really locked everything on my skin.  Good product for people who are looking for a natural night cream that helps acne. I recommend putting another layer of bee wax cream or Un-Petroleum Multi-Purpose Jelly if you have dry skin.    I hope this helps what you&#x27;re looking for!:)</li>
    <li> The fragrance is really strong in this cream. I was unaware of this before I bought it and it seems to irritate my skin a little bit. The cream is nice and soft and I might use it on my feet... but I don&#x27;t know how I feel about putting such a strong fragrance on my face. Also, on their website they say that they use natural AND synthetic ingredients for parfum, but it doesn&#x27;t say which is used in this cream.</li>
    <li> wife loves the product</li>
    <li> Being a women in the mid 50&#x27;s, with drying skin, I do not like a heavy, sticky cream feeling on my skin.  This Radiance Night Cream is AWESOME!  I actually use it in the morning before I put my makeup on as well.  It has help immensely with my dry skin issue.  My makeup goes on smoother and there are no unsightly makeup lines on my face.  I love this product and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It&#x27;s really light and still manages to be really moisturizing.  The day cream is fantastic as well.</li>
    <li> I love the smell! The only night moisturizer I use.</li>
    <li> Love this cream and the way it feels! I use it every night before bed :)</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as I hoped</li>
    <li> I used to use Neutrogenas night cream, but it always stung my face a bit, and I always woke up with an oily face.&lt;br /&gt;I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees about a week ago, and am absolutely happy with it. My face isn&#x27;t oily when i wake up, and it doesn&#x27;t sting upon applying it. Scent isn&#x27;t strong.</li>
    <li> My only night cream now.  After using this and waking up, I find my skin soft, refreshed and more even toned than when I applied.  I especially love that this is such a natural product.  It seems and feels good going on, and I know it&#x27;s healthy for my skin to absorb.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years now and it&#x27;s amazing! I totally recommend it! Leaves my skin soft and radiant! I love it!</li>
    <li> This night cream is super light and smells great! It&#x27;s a little bit greasier than other night creams I&#x27;ve tried (aveno, olay), but it reduces really moisturizes my skin and reduces redness.</li>
    <li> this night creme item surely does its wonders while one is asleep.  in the morning, my face surely radiates and fine lines disappear.  this creme does not irritate my skin and I do not get any allergic reaction to it.  I use this together with my radiance facial cleanser by Burt&#x27;s bees too.</li>
    <li> For one, the packaging wasn&#x27;t great, as it showed up damaged.  The lid had a major crack and doesnt even stay on. Some of the lotion came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I repurchased it (couldnt return it, I received the first tub the night before a long vacation and didn&#x27;t have time), and I just haven&#x27;t seen any results. Apparently from what I&#x27;ve read, the formula has changed? I&#x27;ve never used the original formula but I can say I&#x27;m not a fan of this one.</li>
    <li> Another Burt&#x27;s Bee product that I love.  It feels great.</li>
    <li> Where do I begin?  Well...I&#x27;m in my 60s and I have dry skin. I have been searching for a cream that will absorb into my skin and actually keep it hydrated.  Normally, the creams I have used (basically tried MANY over the years) absorb, but for some reason they dry out after a few hours. So, I wake up with dry skin or if I apply cream under my makeup during the day, as the day progresses my skin dries out.  Well...this cream is truly different! I apply it at night and wake up with my skin still feeling hydrated. And under make up it lasts all day long with no problem! My skin feels soft and silky all day. Also, lines and wrinkles have definitely diminished. After a long cold winter living in a heated house with dry air my skin was extremely thirsty! This is exactly what it needed!&lt;br /&gt;NOW FOR THE BEST AND MOST AMAZING PART OF MY EXPERIENCE...(drum roll)...I have had a small patch of psoriasis on the back of my neck for several years. Basically, I&#x27;ve been treating it with cortisone to keep it calm.  Well...the other night I was applying the Burt&#x27;s Cream to my face, and the psoriasis patch on the back of my neck was itchy and burning, so instead of applying the cortisone, I decided to apply some Burt&#x27;s Cream to the patch...guess what??? the next morning I woke up and IT WAS GONE! And it hasn&#x27;t returned! I only used the Burts Cream on it ONCE! I am truly in shock...but the entire patch is GONE!  I had to write this review because I know so many people struggle with psoriasis and I just want to share my experience.  I don&#x27;t know if it will work for other people, but it worked for me and I hope it will work for others too! After years of suffering with itch and burning, I finally have relief. And my skin on my face looks great!  Thank you Burt and thank you Bees for Royal Jelly with all the goodness in it!</li>
    <li> The skin is very comfortable with a taste like the real thing, can feel moisture,The skin is very comfortable with a taste like the real thing, can feel moisture,</li>
    <li> irritates my eyes..even though i don&#x27;t apply it to my eye area :/</li>
    <li> all are excellent burt bee products do not contain chemicals that harm the skin I recommend them all thanks burt bee</li>
    <li> My husband picked this product for me as a Christmas gift.  Night cremes at retail stores are very expensive and sometimes do not work as expected.  Radiance night creme is a good replacement for those products.  It leaves my face smooth and fresh by morning, providing moisture to help eliminate wrinkles and dryness. I would highly recommend to anyone wanting less dryness and smoother face and neck areas.</li>
    <li> This product is so smooth and wonderful, I&#x27;d buy even if it didn&#x27;t actually do anything! I&#x27;m a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but sometimes products leave you feeling sticky or greasy, but not this one! It smooths right into the skin, doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, and leaves my face feeling moisturized and wonderful.  My local pharmacy stopped selling it, so I had to turn to Amazon, and I&#x27;m so glad I found it here still!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this, and has trouble finding it in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon seems to be a good bargan and the subscribe and save method ensures that she will never run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that when she wakes up after using this product she is more beautfull and raident than the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(note that she sometimes reads my reviews)</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. I have combination skin type and its the perfect moisturizer. I use it as a daily moisturizer. I like my face moisturized during the day and this keeps up to my standards. The day cream is good too from Burt&#x27;s Bees (radiance).</li>
    <li> I was impressed on how light it was even though  it was a cream. My skin has improved so much since using this cream.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this - fresh and not overly fragrant. Makes my skin feels soft, smooth, and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Best night cream for all types of skin. 99% natural is a plus.</li>
    <li> Use in the summer with a little bit tired, maybe more suitable for winter use, valid until the end of 2014</li>
    <li> This is always an excellent quality product but not available locally, so once again, Amazon comes to the rescue. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I use many Burt&#x27;s Bees products-this cream, the facial wipes, the lip balm and the herbal blemish stick with tea tree oil.  The products all work as claimed and cost less than other brands.</li>
    <li> I love Butts Bees products and this was another winner. I already use their day cream and this night cream is just as good. Service was good too.</li>
    <li> Nice night cream.  Smooth application.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m not a lotion kinda guy but my wife convinced me to try it and now I&#x27;m hooked on this stuff. Just a tiny dab at night is all you need. I use it to help repair sun damage that I get during the day as I&#x27;m outside almost constantly. Use this in combination with the radiance day lotion with SPF15 and its an awesome combo. Skin is less damaged now.</li>
    <li> just so so  not good but not bad</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes my skin feel very fresh looks a bit greasy at first but it absorbs nicely and your face in the morning looks well rested and does not dry your skin.</li>
    <li> I have normal to dry skin. This cream is not too buttery, not too dry, just right. Makes my face soft. However, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell and that is the only reason I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Ok, it may be a bit unusual for a man to use a night face cream, but I&#x27;m well groomed and like to take care of myself, but still a manly man!! I only bought this product because I have been using the Burt&#x27;s Bees Royal Jelly Eye cream for years, and have experimented with a large variety of skin products for the past 2 decades. I actually alternate it with Beta-Ginseng face cream from Earth Science, which I tend to favor over the years. The Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Night Creme goes on smooth, absorbs fast, feels very light; you don&#x27;t even feel that it&#x27;s there, and keeps my skin soft and moisturized. The only minor set back I have, is that it gives a semi powdery pale look to my olive skin, but that&#x27;s a personal thing. Aside from that, it&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this on my neck at night and it does it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;m not a fan of lotions that have a scent, but this one isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I was too excited to get this product after reading good reviews. But I was disappointed after using this for a week. I hate the sticky, disgusting feeling it leaves on my face. Whatever it has in it, the face doesn&#x27;t absorb this cream. It stays on face like a thick layer. It then starts peeling and such. Going to bed at night with this cream on, I wake up with peeled cream particles on my eye brows. Yucky.  The skin just doesn&#x27;t absorb it! No soft feeling either. The other day, I just couldn&#x27;t stand that feeling and itched ;and finally washed my face off with cold water and put a different cream. Don&#x27;t buy it; or try before purchasing if possible. Just waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I purchased this product on Amazon and not for the full price at the drugstore. I had high hopes for this moisturizer and looked forward to trying it. After using it every night until the whole jar was gone, though, I have to say I was disappointed. This claims to impart radiance to the skin, but it was just a basic face cream. It did nothing more than moisturize. It felt heavy on my skin and although the strong scent didn&#x27;t bother me at first, halfway through the jar I became thoroughly sick of it. I am not sensitive to scents at all, yet even I believed this product to have a strong smell. I don&#x27;t think it does any of the things it claims to do. Maybe you will like this product more if you are into natural products, but in my opinion, there are many better options out there that will not only impart radiance to the skin immediately, but work to make the skin look healthier in the long run, too.</li>
    <li> This is the best night cream I ever tried, I wak up every morning with a fresh and beautiful skin, very pleased with this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, its true.  I&#x27;m in my forties and still look in my thirties.  Not sure if its this cream doing the trick or not, but for years I have used a couple dabs every night on my face.  Not oily.  No strong fancy scent which I like.  I believe in the power of the bee.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly! Honestly, I would purchase this cream for the smell alone. The fragrence is almost a soft honey? I can&#x27;t exactly place it but it&#x27;s light and refreshing. I&#x27;m not sure why the other reviews are so negative towards the scent. Maybe I got a jar that was the old formula? Not sure but I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> My wife is a smoking hottie, I didn&#x27;t really think she could get any hotter. Well, I was wrong, as usual.  After using Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Night Cream, she looks like a goddess. I am actually afraid to let her out of the house now because I think people might get her confused with an ancient Greek deity. I am really concerned that people might start sacrificing animals to her and that&#x27;s just icky. I can&#x27;t say for sure what they put in this stuff because I haven&#x27;t read the ingredients, but I am pretty sure they put unicorn droppings in it because my spouse looks like a beautiful mythical creature. This is dream cream.</li>
    <li> Great natural product and pleasant smell</li>
    <li> very goodMy normal size is a 9 or 10 and I ordered a 10 because the review here and on other sites said they run small...the 10 is big, I probably should have gone with the 9 since there are no half sizes. I&#x27;m going to keep it and wear with two pairs of socks. Haven&#x27;t tried outside yet but the grips seem really good and the boot itself seems like it will definitely keep my feet warm. Wish there was a little bit more arch support, but I like the boots because they fit under the jeans easily or could be worn with leggings on a warmer day to show off the cute buckles. Over all, I think they were definitely worth the $33 dollars that I paid for them, considering other websites are selling them in the $70-120 range - after all, they are rated to keep your feet warm to -25 degrees. ***Update, ended up sending them back because the holes for the buckles were not punched all the way (so not adjustable) and even with two pairs of socks they were still quite big. Seems like they have overadjusted for the sizing issue they had before.</li>
    <li> Delivery date was met.  Ive noticed no difference on my face.  But I will continue to use it as its only been 3weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I have to be careful about facial creams because many of them irritate my skin and my eyes, even if I don&#x27;t apply it near my eyes. I love Radiance day cream, so I decided to give the night cream a try. It is thicker in consistency compared to the day cream, and it works very well on my dry skin. I find that it absorbs pretty quickly. In fact, sometimes I even use it during the day, and I can even apply it around my eyes because it is not irritating at all. I would imagine that for someone with oily skin this cream would not work as well.  While the scent does not really bother me, I do find it a little strong. If you are sensitive to scents, this cream may not be for you.</li>
    <li> This cream has such a nice scent. It also feels lovely on the face and neck and is a pleasure to wear in the day time or night time.</li>
    <li> I bought this together with the cleanser. Burt&#x27;s bees products have always been my favorite. it is a very thick creme, great for winter time.</li>
    <li> It is a little greasy. But it is a very good cream for dry skin like mine. I have been used several bottles and still love it.</li>
    <li> I do not use this product daily, but once/twice a week. It is excellent at giving my skin a boost of moisture (which I really need living in the desert of AZ). Because it is super hydrating, my skin looks a little greasy, so I usually apply at night or on a day when I know I will be around the house. I would highly recommend this product. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I wanted something natural and not greasy and thick and this fits the bill perfect! Love the eye cream too. May try the day cream next!</li>
    <li> I use it every night. It feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> I really do not like this stuff. The smell is just awful! My husband wanted to sleep in the guest room. I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews. There are so many products that are better, dozens of them at all price points. Don&#x27;t even think about using this as a night cream!</li>
    <li> Burts Bees Radiance Night Creme is overrated. For the money a person could buy a good moisturizer and get the same results. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Burts for years and thought the product was &#x27;pure&#x27;. But according to the EWG/ Skin Deep website the product is NOT as pure as I thought scoring a 5 which is a moderate hazard. On the same website there are a TON of other products that truly are pure and toxin free. Bottom line is that Burts Bees does not have a consistent formula across the board when it comes to the moisturizers. The body soaps and shampoos score very well however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your research :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I use this with the radiance face wash and it&#x27;s amazing, but only after I get out of the shower. If I put it on after washing my face in the sink it feels way too heavy.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  Getting harder to find at a good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the ageless, sensitive, and moisturizing bees wax. This stuff is the best. I use in combination with straight coconut oil under my eyes at night and my face feels fabulous. The skin is calm, and uninflamed, and not flaky at all. It&#x27;s also not too creamy fro my T zone, where I usually have problems. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this moisturizer.  I live in Colorado, and even the tough, dry winter months here are no match for this stuff.  My skin is so flawless that I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation anymore.  At 32, My skin is better than it was at 18.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> had a odd smell and way to thick</li>
    <li> This cream does have a &amp;#34;jelly&amp;#34;-like consistency and in the morning I can feel it laying on top of my skin. I do not like it because after only 2 weeks I developed tiny red bumps all over my entire forehead (some kind of acne reaction). There is obviously something in this product that is not good for acne/combination skin because this only happens to me when I used heavy oils or other pore clogging products. I gave it to my mom, I assume with her dryer skin type it will be lovely.</li>
    <li> Works well for my skin which usually breaks out anytime I use lotion. Makes my skin feel nice. I think it smells funny. My husband likes the smell. Maybe I&#x27;m just picky.</li>
    <li> Use the burts bee eye cream and i love it so i thought i would love the night cream too! I love the night cream. I will only buy burts bees cream from now on. The best cream for the money you spend. I have bought $50 face creams in the past but i can&#x27;t afford to buy those every 6 weeks. This cream is just as good as expensive creams or even better!</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels when I put this on. It does not sting your eyes when applied around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to friends. The cream was super-creamy and super moisturizing for my extra-dry skin. Half the jar is gone and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in fine lines, wrinkles or thinning skin, but I will continue to buy this for my moisturizing top layer.</li>
    <li> Love this cream, as I love all of the Burts Bees products. Makes an immediate visible difference in skin texture and keeps improving on it, as you use it daily.  The Burts Bees products are so much better than other heavily perfumed creams and they are less costlier and have better results. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin daily moisturizer, but wanted something with a little spf, so bought the radience line - daily, night and eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product went on tacky and greasy and stayed that way. It never soaked into my skin. I even waited 30 minutes before applying makeup. I used a really good eye shadow primer and withing 10 minutes, my eye shadow was creased and smeared and worn off my eye lids. My face remained tacky to the touch all day. I was so relieved to wash it off. To top it off, there is a strange sour smell to the scent of this product that I don&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the eye cream and the night moisturizer. The night cream is smoother, less greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky at all. It also smells great, without the sour smell. It absorbs well, making my skin soft, subtle, lightly scented and smooth. I love the night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream is even tackier than the daily moisturizer and just slides around on my skin like gel or something. The eye cream smells even more sour. So far the sensitive skin moisturizer does better for making my fine lines less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mid 30s with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I got this because I started using the Radiance day cream and this is just as good. I use it every night and my face is soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I have also been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Night cream for a long time.  It is a good rich cream.  I recommend its use.</li>
    <li> have loved this for years- kind of greasy- a night cream...super soft and moisturized skin in the morning- smells super good!</li>
    <li> My wife likes this and it sounds good to the skin.  I am &#x27;safe&#x27; now since she is much happy.</li>
    <li> About to empty my first bottle of this! (Noooo!) Gotta buy more because it works so well at moisturizing my face while I sleep! The overall texture of my fave has improved and now I don&#x27;t get people saying I look tired, or asking if I&#x27;m okay anymore. I&#x27;m buying more while I still have a little bit left so I can continue applying this stuff religiously.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream every night about three weeks ago.  After a week I could see a difference.  After three weeks I am AMAZED!  The fine lines around my mouth are definitely less noticeable.  The biggest change however is in the overall even tone that my skin has now as a result of using this nightly.  I would actually consider going out now without foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers compain about the fragrance and the consistency.  It does its work very efficiently, so a thin layer is all you need.  I like the fragrance, but even if I didn&#x27;t care for it, the fragrance is not overpowering as long as you don&#x27;t use a lot of it at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended by this 65 year old!</li>
    <li> I really like the day cream, so I figured I&#x27;d give the night cream a try.  The product is very thick and goopy, but does spread on my face easily.  The smell is rather strong, and very medicinal.  If you like perfumey creams you will not like this one, though the scent does tone down with time.  As a night cream, it is meant to stay on the skin and absorb slowly overnight, to help plump the skin and hydrate it.  It does stay on the skin and absorb slowly, but I don&#x27;t think this is a good cream if you have oily or combo skin.  I have not noticed any significant hydration in the morning because of it.  I have combo skin, and I can use it once or twice a week at the most, and it will cause breakouts for me.  I find it much better for me in the winter months when the air is dry and cold, but still not ideal.  I use this so sparingly that the one jar I purchased will last me a very long time, and I don&#x27;t think I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product! This is a perfect non-greasy and nourishing moisturizer. It can be applied anytime of the day due to it&#x27;s wonderful property to be absorbed easily on the skin, it literally just disappears! The fragrance is all natural and just amazing, like smelling a fruit (guava to be specific) smoothie! Very little quantity you need to apply. SO $14 product would last me I think 4 months,not bad at all I&#x27;d say. It&#x27;s worth all the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my nightly routine, I like to cake my face up with burt bee&#x27;s radiance night cream and Queen Bee&#x27;s eye cream all over my face. Since Queen bee is all bee&#x27;s wax, it needs some moisturizer to spread easily over the skin, radiance works like charm besides providing the skin its own goodness. In the morning, the glow on the face is amazing and skin is supple and blemish free. After shower, the skin feels a bit dry, so I just spread some quantity of radiance cream and I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, I&#x27;ll definitely buy over and over!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been obsessed with Burt&#x27;s Bees products lately. This is my latest discovery. It smells wonderful! A soft, fresh smell that&#x27;s perfect for nighttime. The formula goes on smoothly on my face and neck and is not oily at all. My skin feels hydrated while I sleep. Royal Jelly is good stuff.</li>
    <li> This is my third one i got from Amazon. First two bottles were great. But this one smelled different. After I used for couple days. My face start break out. Little pimples everywhere. I only use baby lotion for a month. My face getting better. Just couple days ago, I start using a tiny on my face again, thought maybe last time because long winter dry air cause my face break out. But again tiny pimples showed up. Mostly on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;The package is exactly same as before. But how inside so different? Disappointed.</li>
    <li> As somebody with super dry and sensitive skin it&#x27;s been a serious struggle finding a good night cream! And I&#x27;ve finallyyyy found it. I just bought my 4th or 5th jar. I&#x27;d say one jar lasts 1 1/2-2 months, so it&#x27;s definitely a good value. I love the way it makes my skin feel! It does take a little longer than some night creams I&#x27;ve used to sink in but I&#x27;m ok with that since I&#x27;m usually just relaxing in bed after I apply it.</li>
    <li> Super moisturizing, nice scent</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve found I can use the Burt&#x27;s Bees products without itching, burning, or breaking out.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product!  It moisturizes my skin all day long even with a coat of foundation cream on top of it.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I love trying new night creams. This is a great choice it just cost a little more than I liked. oko ok ok ok I dont know what else to say.</li>
    <li> I definitely moisturizing, it feels very thick on my face, but makes my face smooth and keeps it hydrated while I sleep.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Soothes my sensitive and dry skin and I have been using this product for over a year.</li>
    <li> reasonably priced good product  would of given 5 stars but has a little bit of scent to it .</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I actually use it in the morning and put it on my neck and upper chest as well.  Let it soak in a couple minutes and then put on my makeup.  I noticed a few years ago I was getting more wrinkles at the corners of my eyes, etc.  I started using this one and the eye cream.  I am 50 this year and have few wrinkles so I guess it is doing what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews and thought that this was going to be night cream gold.  Ultimately, it works less well than my LUSH products.  I should have just spent the extra money and got the LUSH product.  While this smells great and goes on nicely, it really does nothing for your complexion.</li>
    <li> An overall wonderful repair cream. Smells divine, has great ingredients, and works wonders! My face has a glow like never before!</li>
    <li> I love this night cream! It is perfect for my dry skin. I have been using this for almost 4 months now and have seen huge improvements in the texture of my skin. My only complaint is I am not a huge fan of potted creams as I prefer pumps however, this product is so nice I can&#x27;t even dock it a star for packaging.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream before and it is excellent!  Smells wonderful, goes on smoothly with no rubbing in and isn&#x27;t greasy feeling. Keeps you moisturized all night without lots of chemicals. I like the more natural ingredients that Burt&#x27;s Bees has and I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use the stuff every night. Not too greasy, light, and moisturizing. Love anything Burts Bees!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know Burt&#x27;s Bees was owned by Clorox until I had a horrible experience with this product. After using the cream for two nights, I suddenly developed hives on my forehead and eyelids. I also felt very tired and sick that I had to lay down. I couldn&#x27;t eat much for the next 24 hours. I then began having diarrhea, which lasted 4 days. I saw my doctor and she said it is very unlikely that a facial cream can cause such a problem. She suggested to do a patch test on my arms. It confirmed that the cream was causing the reaction. I did a quarter sized test on both arms, and each time I developed a rash 2 days later accompanied by diarrhea. I contacted customer service, and learned that the product&#x27;s ingredients are actually 4 pages long, and they are not able to disclose it unless my doctor contacts them (I also learned that they are now owned by Clorox). I had an allergy test since then for about 40 substances, but had no strong reaction(I had no serious allergy to anything until now). It will be very hard for me to find out what caused the reaction. I did get a rash with their fragrance-free baby lotion last year, so it may be something used in both products. I just want to warn other customers that a topical cream can cause such serious issues. They shouldn&#x27;t be marketing their products as natural and safe for babies.</li>
    <li> I really like all Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  This cream protects without leaving a greasy feel to your face.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a change?</li>
    <li> Wow!!!!!!! I have been wanting to try for a while (but alil pricey but I got it anyway). And I am so happy I did...just in a couple days my face and neck is so much more smooth and glowing. Two thumbs up .....thanks burts bees!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees products. Item arrived quick, fresh and at a good price!</li>
    <li> Not greasy and lightweight; however, it smells like black licorice. Yuck, not a fan of the scent. I also purchased this product because of the natural ingredient appeal, and come to find out that it rates a 5 on the EWG Cosmetic Website. I will continue the search for a nightly moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love this night cream. Smells amazing and really softens my skin.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for a good/heavy night cream that would ensure that my face Wouldnt dry out during the day. Worked extremely well and although I wasn&#x27;t necessarily looking to improve the overall appearance of my skin, I did notice my complexion brightened a considerable amount. I will say that I gave the product a 4/5 because it is a tad too greasy, but then again it is a night cream so what can I expect.</li>
    <li> I swear this stuff makes my face look moisturized, dewey, and younger.  It smooths  me out and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have had problems all my life with sensitive skin, and I have to be very careful when trying new products. I really love how quickly my skin absorbs this night creme, its soothing and leaves no oily residue on you or your pillow.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing, rich night creme.  I am 38 with combination skin, but leaning towards the dry side.  We live in the desert and I suffer tremendously from the arid climate and the sun is pretty harsh too.  This is exactly what I needed. If it&#x27;s super windy or noticeably dryer outside, I&#x27;ll apply it under my SPF day lotion too.  My skin feels fantastic, nourished and healed after I put this on.</li>
    <li> Great value, although lid was cracked.</li>
    <li> Definitely a night cream (you cannot wear this in the day, because it is too heavy and does turn a bit greasy on one&#x27;s face). That said, I feel it has good brightening and firming qualities. I have only been using this product a short time. It takes 3 weeks for one&#x27;s skin to shed to actually see the full results of a products and it has not been this long for me. I will say though, this product has been around for a long time and I regret not trying it sooner. I have tried much more expensive products that I feel perform less. I will repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about four years and I couldn&#x27;t live without it!  I think it&#x27;s help keep my skin in great shape and I love the texture of this cream and the light fragrance of it.</li>
    <li> Favorite face cream of all tiem.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!! I have only been using it for a week and already my skin looks so much healthier. I have very sensitive skin and every time I&#x27;ve used other products, my face either gets an allergic reaction or I break out, with this product that has not happened. Even my friend can tell the difference with out me asking them. Truly recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any better than anything else, but I like it pretty well.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product too all women who want a radiant glowing skin complexion. The product is absorbent and the texture of the cream is light when applying to your face and neck. I was happy to see the postman with a amazon package for me today. Can&#x27;t wait to apply my Burt Bee&#x27;s Radiance night cream today.</li>
    <li> I tried this night cream for a week but I had to return it to the store.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the long term benefit is, but couple things really turned me off to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the fragrance is too strong. It also lingered, and I could smell it all the time from my own face. It&#x27;s like a flower/pollen smell. Not exactly a pleasant kind; it was as if I dipped my face into a bouquet of strong smelling flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the cream is a bit too sticky feeling for me. Perhaps it&#x27;s the beeswax, but instead of a moist supple feeling, it&#x27;s like a tacky-glue feeling. Not overwhelming, but enough for me to be annoyed by it. I could have dealt with the smell if the hydration quality was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it may be a great formula for some and is affordably priced for a nightcream with safe, natural ingredients. I certainly can&#x27;t afford to pay 40-50 dollars for stuff like Lancome or Clinique night creams. I went back to the store and purchased the naturally ageless night cream and that one&#x27;s ok and the fragrance isn&#x27;t the best but it doesn&#x27;t linger like the Radiance did. However after I run out of it I want to try burt&#x27;s bees other night creams that I noticed are sold on amazon such as the intense hydration and carrot nutritive.</li>
    <li> I love it, my skin is glowing and  healthy, I wanted all natural night cream so I love it, It&#x27;s take few day get results. So I would like to recommond to anyone who wants beautiful healthy skin. :)</li>
