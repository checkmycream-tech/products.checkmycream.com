    <li> Love this shampoo. Use only a little with each use as it suds up really well. Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful shampoo and is all that I use.  I also send it to my daughter in Seattle, WA as she also loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn F.,&lt;br /&gt;Carlsbad, CA</li>
    <li> Very good for colored hair. I have used this product for the past 1 year and have no complains yet</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my dried out and frizzy hair smooth and easy to manage. And there is no build up of residue over time.  I love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It leaves hair  soft and moisturized. Wish the Company would send me coupon for free bottle.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommends this shampoo.  It is very good and protects the color on my hair while doing nothing to dim my highlights.</li>
    <li> This is the same shampoo my stylist uses on me at her salon. It&#x27;s awesome!! Light scent, not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Good for color.</li>
    <li> This is a great color shampoo, I&#x27;ve been using it for several years.  Keeps my Iona haircolor from fading.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this shampoo in conjunction with the expert series Conditioner, I was amazed at the difference in the texture of my hair.  It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.

    <li> The best. After years of dry colored hair my hair is now soft and shiny. Once in awhile I will use something else but go right back to this. It&#x27;s a miracle shampoo!</li>
    <li> Nothing super spectacular...just kind of generic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for over a year. It is gentle and prevents color fade. It is light weight and does not weigh down my fine hair. My color last for 7 weeks with little fade.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well for dry, color-treated hair. It leaves hair silky soft and manageable. The shampoo is raspberry scented and lathers up very well. Rinses clean without drying or stripping the hair.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, leaves hair clean and with body - great scent - rinses out well - you only need a bit of this to lather up so it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years.  My hair loves it.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous times to find a product that doesn&#x27;t contain parabens, but keep coming back to this one.  If they took the parabens out, I&#x27;d give it 5+ stars!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an overly perfumey scent and is not drying so I don&#x27;t use conditioner each time. You only need a little so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shampoos I have used.  My hair feel clean and manageable.  It looks soft  and holds the style</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo especially in the summer when my hair gets harder to control with the humidity.  It smooths and tames my hair.  Makes it shiny.  It&#x27;s hard to find and expensive but I think it&#x27;s worth it. Plus, I get my hair professionally colored and I hate the thought of any shampoo washing out my color.  This seems to keep the color longer.</li>
    <li> Not sure how well the product holds hair color and I guess I won&#x27;t be finding out since when I received my order it had leaked out into the box.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  It works well, is affordable and I love the pump, in the shower!</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s excellent. Very pleased!!!!!</li>
