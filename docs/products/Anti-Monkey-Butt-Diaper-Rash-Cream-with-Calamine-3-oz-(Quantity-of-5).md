### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great quality diaper rash cream!</li>
      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>This diaper paste is the best diaper paste I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Positively awesome diaper cream and smells good too!</li>
      <li>One added benefit of this paste is that it has a pleasant baby smell, not medicinal at all!</li>
      <li>Great product that I would recommend to everyone.</li>
      <li>This cream works great for diaper rash, I can tell a difference within one change of diapers.</li>
      <li>It works just as great for a baby cream as well.</li>
      <li>Then we discovered this one and we love it!  </li>
      <li>It works amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>We make sure that when ever we leave the house for a trip that this is in our bag.  </li>
      <li>and i fell in love.</li>
      <li>Great product, fast service (2 times)</li>
      <li>Their powder is also one of my favourites :)</li>
      <li>There is nothing that I know of that works better.  </li>
      <li>As a parent and pharmacist, I started off trying more popular brands that I was familiar with and used my knowledge to make an educated decision about what diaper paste to purchase.  </li>
      <li>It creates a barrier between sore bottoms and harsh diarrhea, it smells great, has great ingredients, and doesn&#x27;t bother my son&#x27;s sore bottom when applied.  </li>
      <li>Butt Diaper Cream is very good - especially if your LO has a diaper rash or is getting one.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend Seventh Generation brand diapers if you want a happy rash free baby.</li>
      <li>This stuff is hands down, the best.</li>
      <li>I give always antimonkey butt as a baby gift and people laugh and think it is a joke, but the healing and prevention is no joke.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the effort, but I wish this came in a jar instead.</li>
      <li>I know it didn&#x27;t hurt him and must be soothing right away.  </li>
      <li>She is very skin sensitive to many things.</li>
      <li>I initially purchased this product due to the cute name and monkey, but it turns out that I had stumbled upon the best diaper paste yet!  </li>
      <li>We have even given out tubes to our friends who have had similar issues with their kids and they love it.</li>
      <li>Great smell and thick paste.</li>
      <li>It is very effective; after only one day of use, I could see a very noticeable different in the degree of healing on his bum.  </li>
      <li>Works wonders for my girls, especially when my toddler gets more of a contact irritation from certain foods.  </li>
      <li>If there is an existing rash, the cream will help it to clear up quickly.  </li>
      <li>but I do really like the product.  </li>
      <li>However, once I bought a whole case of 5 it seemed to cause a rash.</li>
      <li>Live by it.</li>
      <li>I know every child is different so this may not be the fix for your family, but it certainly was for mine!</li>
      <li>When you take the cap off you get a real oily product that is quite messy especially when you near the end of a diaper change that was already challenging.  </li>
      <li>I use the regular anti monkey butt for riding horses in the hot weather, and my husband uses it for working out.</li>
      <li>I really liked this when I first purchased in store because it didn&#x27;t smell as bad as other diaper creams.  </li>

<li> We go through this like water with 3 little ones with sensitive skin, this is the only stuff that works for us, and we&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING!</li>
<li> Before Anti-Monkey Butt, my son would get very severe, red, raw diaper rash and he would scream at every diaper change, even when I applied other creams to try to soothe the rash.  </li>
<li> My son has red hair and very pale sensitive skin.</li>
<li> The ones in the store were just OK, but were not very effective on severely broken down skin.  </li>
<li> He&#x27;s gotten a little red from time to time but no blood or sores since we started using it.  </li>
<li> We did butt paste, aquaphor, burt&#x27;s bees, and one other I can&#x27;t remember.  </li>
<li> I cut the tubes in half and spatula the cream into a jar.  </li>
<li> However, the packaging is hard to use and you run out of ability to squeeze the tube long before the cream is gone.  </li>
<li> Even after the broken down skin healed, I continue to use this as a preventative measure.  </li>
<li> I am not too crazy about the container (seems to get lot of &amp;#34;air&amp;#34;</li>
<li> We do cloth diapers to help with the diaper rash, but he was still getting bloody sores on his bottom.  </li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t find another brand that has calamine in addition to the zinc.  Works wonders for my girls, especially when my toddler gets more of a contact irritation from certain foods.  We use it every night and as needed during the day.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that got rid of my son&#x27;s diaper rash.  It works amazingly well.  Five stars for the cream.  However, the packaging is hard to use and you run out of ability to squeeze the tube long before the cream is gone.  I cut the tubes in half and spatula the cream into a jar.  It&#x27;s worth the effort, but I wish this came in a jar instead.</li>
    <li> Live by it. Accept no substitute.</li>
    <li> This product recently seems to separate.  When you take the cap off you get a real oily product that is quite messy especially when you near the end of a diaper change that was already challenging.  We used this for over 18 months without any problems then the last order was like what is described above.</li>
    <li> This diaper paste is the best diaper paste I&#x27;ve ever tried.  As a parent and pharmacist, I started off trying more popular brands that I was familiar with and used my knowledge to make an educated decision about what diaper paste to purchase.  The ones in the store were just OK, but were not very effective on severely broken down skin.  I initially purchased this product due to the cute name and monkey, but it turns out that I had stumbled upon the best diaper paste yet!  Before Anti-Monkey Butt, my son would get very severe, red, raw diaper rash and he would scream at every diaper change, even when I applied other creams to try to soothe the rash.  Once I started using this paste, he no longer cried when I applied it, so I know it didn&#x27;t hurt him and must be soothing right away.  It is very effective; after only one day of use, I could see a very noticeable different in the degree of healing on his bum.  Even after the broken down skin healed, I continue to use this as a preventative measure.  The only time he gets a diaper rash now is if I forget to use Anti-Monkey Butt for a couple days.  One added benefit of this paste is that it has a pleasant baby smell, not medicinal at all!</li>
    <li> Only stuff that works! My son always reacted to everything else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it worked for others, but my patient had a reaction to it. She is very skin sensitive to many things.</li>
    <li> Butt Diaper Cream is very good - especially if your LO has a diaper rash or is getting one.  I am not too crazy about the container (seems to get lot of &amp;#34;air&amp;#34; bubbles) but I do really like the product.  Their powder is also one of my favourites :)</li>
    <li> This about the the only thing outside a prescription that works on our kids diaper rashes.  We make sure that when ever we leave the house for a trip that this is in our bag.  We have even given out tubes to our friends who have had similar issues with their kids and they love it.</li>
    <li> There is nothing that I know of that works better.  If there is an existing rash, the cream will help it to clear up quickly.  It seems to prevent rashes.  I highly recommend Seventh Generation brand diapers if you want a happy rash free baby.</li>
    <li> I tried all the others- a friend gave me a tube of antimonkey butt for my baby and i fell in love. I give always antimonkey butt as a baby gift and people laugh and think it is a joke, but the healing and prevention is no joke. This stuff is hands down, the best.</li>
    <li> Great quality diaper rash cream! Helps prevent rash and heals when one does occur. Great smell and thick paste.</li>
    <li> We tried a number of diaper rash creams before coming across this one.  We did butt paste, aquaphor, burt&#x27;s bees, and one other I can&#x27;t remember.  My son has red hair and very pale sensitive skin. We do cloth diapers to help with the diaper rash, but he was still getting bloody sores on his bottom.  Then we discovered this one and we love it!  He&#x27;s gotten a little red from time to time but no blood or sores since we started using it.  I know every child is different so this may not be the fix for your family, but it certainly was for mine!</li>
    <li> We go through this like water with 3 little ones with sensitive skin, this is the only stuff that works for us, and we&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This cream works great for diaper rash, I can tell a difference within one change of diapers. I have been using it for about 2 years now with my oldest and continued to use it with the youngest as well. Great product that I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast service (2 times)</li>
    <li> Positively awesome diaper cream and smells good too!</li>
    <li> I use the regular anti monkey butt for riding horses in the hot weather, and my husband uses it for working out. It works just as great for a baby cream as well.</li>

    <li> It creates a barrier between sore bottoms and harsh diarrhea, it smells great, has great ingredients, and doesn&#x27;t bother my son&#x27;s sore bottom when applied.  Nuf said!</li>
