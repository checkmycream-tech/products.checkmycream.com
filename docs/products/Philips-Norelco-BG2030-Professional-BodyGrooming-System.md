<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have an old model that is damaged but working although I have to hold it firmly in my hands. I caused the damage.  I bought this new one and it is a good old version&#x27;s update.</li>
    <li> I was a bit of a skeptic when purchasing because with coarser hair I usually have some trouble with shavers pulling or pinching. This one works great. No pinching or pulling. It is waterproof so you can use it in the shower and its very easy to clean. The battery life on it is amazing too. Overall a great trimmer by Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> -dual head offering is spectacular.  trimming head is quite useful (i use it as much as the foil head). foil head is improved over the original as well.    -redesigned razor body fits better in my hand    -this is my only razor- i even use it on my face (though I&#x27;m not shaving below the follicle)      -overall look is improved, which, if I have it sitting out charging 24/7 is at least somewhat important    Summary:    For a few dollars more buy this much improved, much more versatile electric razor- it is much better than the original bodygroom.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. I bought it to replace my old trimmer (the basic Norelco Bodygroomer) and I am almost glad my old one broke so that I was able to upgrade to this one. The two different heads make it easy to transition from trimming to shaving. My favorite is the adjustable combs. On my old trimmer, it just came with 3 seperate comb lengths that you had to clip on. It wasn&#x27;t the biggest inconvenience, but I always had to change out the comb whenever I wanted a different length. With this new trimmer, there are 5 different settings and you can easily change from one to the next by just sliding the comb up or down. Another great feature is that everything stores nice and neat in the base which doubles as the charger. My old one didnt come with anything or anyplace to store the combs.    Over all, I was glad I spent the few extra bucks for this professional groomer. It makes trimming and shaving so much easier</li>
    <li> First time I ever purchased a body shaver and was nervous about using it; especially below the waist.  I did read all of the reviews between this model and the 20 and decided on this one. So far no problems was very easy to use and took a little time to understand what the trimmer settings, sometimes i wanted to remove more aftewards. Had some irriatation but for someone new they said that was normal.</li>
    <li> I have to say, when I bought this I was a little bit skeptical. After using it though, It works great. After using Blades for all these years, this is definitely the way to go and so much easier. I like all the different attachements as well. Since I have relatively thin hair on my body, I use just the main foil and one other attachement mainly. I would definitely recommend this bodygoomer, and after using it, I can see why it&#x27;s rated so Highly.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Got it for my husband who is stationed in Afghanistan and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I have my bf trim my back hair to nice and smooth! . It takes a few minutes and this thing works perfect! If your super hairy (fur coat on your back) you may want to trim first with a chain saw then use this after</li>
    <li> Using this product is certainly better than using scissors or the pop-up trimmer on the back of an electric razor. My body hair looks great and is much easier to maintain. However, though this product is better than what I was using, a close shave is still difficult to achieve with it; I find it better just to use it for trimming, which is what it&#x27;s really good for.</li>
    <li> Came charged. I have yet to have to charge it. Works great for me... all over. No problems.</li>
    <li> Bought this trimmer because the trimmer on my new, expensive electric razor doesn&#x27;t do a very good job. This trimmer does a fantastic job with neck, sideburns, eyebrows, ears, etc. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> received on time the norelco bg2030 but the shaving head was damaged, called norelco and they did mail new one for free</li>
    <li> It works great. Will leave you clean and well groomed without much pain and efforts.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I shave without any of the attachments to avoid razor burn, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. One pass and hair is gone. Other trimmers I&#x27;d have to go over the same spot up to 4 times to get all the hair. This has power.     As a body trimmer its perfect, I&#x27;ve even given myself a buzzcut with it and it works as well if not better than any hair groomer I&#x27;ve used.    Definite 5 star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve kept myself trimmed with a comb and clippers for many years. Nary a scratch. I saw this shaver and thought I would try the slick look for a while.   As a trimmer. the Bodygroom works reasonably well. The combs don&#x27;t glide very well, and it takes a lot of passes to get everything even.  As a shaver, it gets nice and close. I found that wet with plenty of shaving soap was the fastest, and dry with talc was also comfortable.  One caveat- this thing is designed to cut. Skin cuts easier than hair, and when it bites into your privates, it HURTS. I got bit about ten times before I retired this thing. I never quite figured out why it would bite. I tried tight skin, wet skin, dry skin, and every once in a while it felt like a match head was jammed into my balls. Ouch.</li>
    <li> So this item does work ok but i feel like you really have to use some pressure to get the shaving foil to work right, the trimmer does work very good though.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for two months now and am satisfied with it, no defects to report. The pieces slide on/off pretty easily and it is easy to use. Pretty simple product overall...</li>
    <li> Performs exactly as advertised. I use it both in the shower and dry and it has no signs of adverse wear from being wet. I tend to be a bit hard on my electronics and this one looks like it will hold up great.</li>
    <li> Second body groomer I have owned from Philips Norelco.  Great trimmer. Easy to use and gives you a close shave in all areas of your body.</li>
    <li> Excellent groomer! Easy to use and can be used wet for the smoothest shave ever!  It&#x27;s very easy to clean! It&#x27;s a little loud when using but I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t wake up the neighbors! My wife loves the fact that I can be clean as a whistle now! Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman and have super sensitive skin - can&#x27;t use regular razor or wax and this, for me, is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t cause ingrown hair or irritation. Plus it&#x27;s perfect both for shaving and trimming.  This is a much improved model - comes with 2 interchangeable attachments, one for shaving and one for trimming. Actually I have no idea why one of the reviewers had a problem with that. The new trimming attachment is much better than the old multiple clip-on combs. Now it&#x27;s enough to adjust the setting to get desired length of trim (and it works much better than the old one).  I do agree that it should come with a travel case - my previous BG2020 somehow just died after a trip in the suitcase.  Also, BG2020 would often pull on skin in sensitive parts (auch!). Never happened with this model.  All in all - buy it! It&#x27;s the best product of its kind.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Has a number of trimming options. Easy to use and maintain. For longer hair works best dry. For shorter hair and less irritation use in the shower.</li>
    <li> My BG 2020 failed after about six months use with the switch getting stuck in the on position. I called customer service and they said they would send a replacement with a pre-paid fedex label to send the old one back in. They sent me a brand new 2030 in place of my broken 2020 ! Wow, hat&#x27;s off to Philips for their stellar customer service. The newer model is far superior than the older one, I use it regularly and am very pleased with the shaver and the service I received from Philips.</li>
    <li> It seems \\&quot;T.J.\\&quot; gave probably the most imformative and accurate review that I read; however, he doesn&#x27;t mention specifically using it on the facial area, and he makes no mention of battery performance either, so if you are interested in my experience on these...read on: So far I love this thing to death! Best $46 I think I ever spent! As a disclaimer and to be fair though, I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet, so can&#x27;t comment on wet usage. Also, I haven&#x27;t used it below the waist but sparingly; however it performed perfectly down there too...so far.    What I REALLY love is the fact that I have found a shaver that I can use on my face without it causing a rash and/or razor burn. If the hair on my face is longer than 1/8\\&quot; or so, I just go over it with one of the micro trimmers first (there is one on either side of the foil attachment), then I go back over it with the foil until it&#x27;s nice and smooth. Voila! No razor burn! I USED TO HAVE a Norelco rotary, triple-head shaver, and that thing just played Hell on my neck! THIS ONE, being a \\&quot;foil\\&quot; head design though, I think is mainly where the difference between the two results is gained. No razor burn, plus it gives a nice clean shave too......Hoooooorrah!! A++++    Now, about battery life: The battery type is a NiMH, which is better than the \\&quot;old style\\&quot; NiCd rechargeables. Instructions say 50 minutes of use from an 8 hour charge, but from my experience.....this seems inecredibly underrated, and actually lasts much longer. I read somewhere that occasionally discharging batteries fully, can extend their life. After fully charging and using mine for the first time, I turned it on and left it running to fully discharge the battery before REcharging it again. That thing ran for at least an hour longer before it ran out of juice, and that was after having just used it for 30 minutes! After charging it fully a second time, I haven&#x27;t charged it since then; that was several shaves/uses ago, however...your mileage may vary.    Alsoregarding the battery: It says not to store it on the charging base so that it won&#x27;t be constantly charging, but for ease of use...I do JUST that.....however, I turn it slightly in it&#x27;s base to where the \\&quot;charging\\&quot; contacts don&#x27;t make contact with each other, and therefore it&#x27;s not actually charging (\\&quot;charging\\&quot; indicator light not on). Solves the problem of unplugging the thing.</li>
    <li> Works very good.  Had the older model and it work very good, but this new model seems to work even better, and even more versatile. Works great for the neither region, lol, no red bumps.  The older model seems to give them from time to time, but so far not this model.  Works great for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to upgrade from it&#x27;s predecessor by Philips Norelco, and am delighted with the differences. I learned to use the previous one to do what I needed to do, this refined device reduces time, improves the quality of the trim and in general, creates a more positive \\&quot;experience\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m hairy, men get more hairy, and some of that hair gets more wild as we age, and I trim to avoid looking like an ill-bred ape, and I need to do it regularly.     The two comb attachment allows me to adjust between how I trim broad regions (chest, legs) and tight regions (groin, butt), and yes, the comb design makes a difference in terms of the feel on one&#x27;s skin in various parts of one&#x27;s anatomy; I&#x27;m glad for the more calibrated instrument as I go \\&quot;down under\\&quot;, but the other comb works well for the vast mowing exercise that my chest, arms and legs represent.  The choice of five settings is useful, although I suspect that the plastic adjustment between settings may fatigue over time, given the relatively lightweight nature of the operating mechanism.  That said, both combs work to capture the bulk of the hair and trim it consistently on the first pass.  A second pass generally nails it for me, with the exception of heavily contoured areas, where I need to pay more attention....  In the past, using the detatchable combs with the preceding model, I needed to take multiple passes, particularly on my legs, and choice of three lengths was somewhat limiting.  This design has really enhanced the comb design so that hair is properly corralled and funneled through the comb teeth, so that I get the overall \\&quot;look\\&quot; I want (trimmed for the most part, but not shaved, consistent length of hair, no \\&quot;bald patches\\&quot;, no dense copses of hair leftover....).  I found that the design of the new combs was less abrasive on my skin, frankly, a welcome change from the previous design.  In addition, the combs stay in place during use, I had a problem with the combs falling off (usually with the head) during use of the predecessor model.      The design of the head seems to be the same, so for close shaving (which I may do less of than other guys, I tend to trim rather than shave) it works the same as the preceeding model.  Careful attention to holding the skin taut solves the dreaded nicking problem.    So, trims more consistently with less repeat \\&quot;sweeps&#x27;, more choices, better comb design.... represents a win all the way around. Storing the accessories in the base is a neat trick, which keeps those accessories from wandering around the bathroom.    The instructions were limited, the pictograms tiny and the \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; process was not really spelled out.  Given the elegant and witty video generated for the first personal trimmer by Philips Norelco, I am surprised that they haven&#x27;t come up with a helpful \\&quot;how to\\&quot; guide tucked into the package. Male bodytrimming is a rather personal topic, it tends to be covered in the media only with snickers and embarassment, you don&#x27;t talk tools and techniques at the coffee machine in the office or in the locker room at the gym - at least the one I go to - , so one learns by trial and error.  A simple two/three page foldout with pictograms might aussuage fears about slicing and dicing so close to so many treasured parts.     I use this because, as an older hairy guy, I want a trim, comfortable, non-sweaty look, I want wild hairs to be trimmed, and I want a decent short \\&quot;look\\&quot; pretty much everywhere.  This device, which I&#x27;ve now used twice, promises to be the most effective personal grooming appliance out there.  now, if Philips could just find a way to magically clean the hairs up after!</li>
    <li> I tried a couple other shavers, but none of them worked very well.  This shaver blows all the others away.  The long trimming head is more difficult to use, but the close shaving head is incredible.  (I use Veet for Sensitive skin to take off the long hair, and then maintain with the Norelco.)  I bought it mostly for groin shaving and, though I was nervous at first, I don&#x27;t worry about it at all anymore.  It never breaks the skin, even at times when it seems like it should, and it still shaves really well.  I have had it pull a little bit on occasion, but it&#x27;s usually because I&#x27;m shaving the wrong way across the hair.    If you have to shave some part of your body for surgery, buy one of these for it.  It may seem like and expensive option, but trust me, it will save you the headache and pain of using a straight razor.  I had a vasectomy and fortunately had one of these.  I took one look at my straight razor and knew it was not an option.    My wife loves it too.  Other razors have irritated her skin, but this does not.    I highly recommend this product.  It ended several years of searching for a good body razor.</li>
    <li> This product is an improvement over the less expensive bodygrooming system.  The attachments provide a more even and controlled cut,  visibility is improved with the attachments, allowing you to see where the cutting is taking place more accurately.  The other big difference is that I experienced NO pulling while cutting.  That alone is worth the proce.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to its description except for the foil shaver.  The trimmer attachments work awesome, but the foil shaver doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Way way better than the old model.  The old model worked fine when you were looking to shave off all hair.  However, if you were looking for a trim look the cutting shields would cause the clipper to not chop the hair down.  the new attachment works wonders.     Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I had purchased the man groomer personal shaver but found it hard to use and hold when trying to reach certain challenging areas.  The on/off switch stopped working properly after only a couple of weeks, bad quality.  So I looked at the the Philips BG2030 and decided to give it a try and I am so happy.  It&#x27;s very easy to hold and the head helps you reach those tight areas hard to reach areas.  Also the option of switching the heads out is awesome and the overall construction of the product is very sound.  Overall a 10 out of 10 for me, I will never buy another personal groomer other than this one.  Buy this you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I had first bought the Philips Norelco BG2030 Bodygrooming system, because I thought that I would be able to use it on my face and on more personal areas like my groin.  When I opened the instruction manual, voila there it said, \\&quot;Not to be used on face,\\&quot; and I was saddened for a moment, but remembered the bigger reason I bought in the first place - to surprise my wife.  I don&#x27;t shave my groin area regularly, because it is very time consuming with a traditional razor, but with this body groomer, it was great.  I was able to shave all of my groin area in less than half an hour and I had no burning or itching afterward.  Great tool!</li>
    <li> Great Trimmer but very Fragile. I dropped once into the floor, it wasn&#x27;t even 4 ft distance, and it broke a the piece inside just like on the picture that someone suffer from the same problem as me. not planning to buy another cheap product like this, i expected more for my money.</li>
    <li> I have only used this unit once but I was very pleased with it.  I haven&#x27;t really used the shaver part as it looks a little flimsy.  I will have to give it a shot in the shower, with shave cream to see if it really works or not.  I would recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> This little tool is great to help remove all of that unwanted body hair before a day at the beach. I&#x27;ve never really used any of the trimmer attachments so I can&#x27;t comment on those, but just using the razor itself is very effective. Waxing hurts like hell, laser hair surgery is too expensive, but for $40 this little guy will do the trick and especially for a first or second date your lucky lady won&#x27;t even know you normally walk around with a thick wool sweater on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised this razor does shave very close to the skin and remarkably there is very little irritation and hardly any of those cases where it painfully tugs on the hair. With that said I&#x27;d still recommend using caution when operating down below trying to gain that optical inch - even minor irritation down there can ruin your day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is definitely a great product and well worth the money. Don&#x27;t bother with painful waxing or smelly Nair sessions when you can do just as good of a job with this guy.</li>
    <li> This is a great grooming shaver!!! I use it for body grooming and also to trim my beard... It gives me a clean cut anywhere I use it... REALLY!!!    It does not give me any skin irritation and have loved it since day 1!!!</li>
    <li> Before finding this body trimmer, I was using a haircut trimmer for my entire body. I&#x27;m a big guy and this worked quit efficiently until it broke. After that I went onto the web a researched body hair trimmers. This Norelco had great reviews so I purchased the item. I could not be happy with the results. This body trimer does it all and is build with great quality. I would highly recommended this trimmer for anyone looking to trim their body hair.</li>
    <li> one of the tabs broke and now the unit it is now close to worthless, It is a bit fragile. It does do a great job when functioning  I will be looking for a replacement. I have held this one together for about 6 months and that is getting old. I will look at the versions with only one head. My opinion is if you are a very careful person and won&#x27;t feel bad when it breaks, it will you know. buy it. otherwise go up to the next version more money but less to break</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for close to a year now, and it has been very reliable with no degredation of the battery yet as far as I can tell.  It&#x27;s good for just about everything advertised, although I should mention that it IS possible to get cut by this shaver.  I&#x27;ve gotten snipped by the double sided trimmer a couple of times times now, so I tend to be a little bit more cautious while using it these days.    Cuts aside, this is a top quality product and helps keep the whole body trimmed and neat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shaver once, but I&#x27;m really satisfied with how it functions. Previously I&#x27;d used regular clippers to shave most of my body with mixed results. This is infinitely better -- no cuts (even on the most sensitive areas), and it does a very thorough job.     My only complaint so far is the narrowness of the head, so that doing my legs takes forever. I&#x27;d rather the head be about twice the width it currently is -- I&#x27;d happily pay an extra $25-50 for the perfect shaver.    Only other comment: My past electric clippers have worn out pretty quickly, requiring sharpening or replacement within a year. I&#x27;ll post a follow-up in 6 months or so to say whether I think this shaver is as durable as it should be.</li>
    <li> Unlike some other razors I have used this one does not aggravate my skin.. since its designed for use all over that is important. Unfortunately is also does not do a great job at removing hair, especially in places where your skin is not smooth and tight. Also, it has a leading and a trailing trimmer blade that I think is supposed to cut hair short before it gets to the shaving blade, while they do do this, they also tens to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; and skin that gets in the way.</li>
    <li> I always do a lot of online research before I go ahead and buy a product. The Norelco BG2030 seemed like the perfect body trimmer for me (I am really hairy all over) and I couldn&#x27;t be more right. Not only does it function as promised but it is also a thing of beauty to the eye. It is really comfortable to the hand and for the first time I haven&#x27;t nicked my skin using a body trimmer. Its non-slippery, rubberized part of its body helps in having a good grip. Its battery lasts a full 1 hour, which is more than sufficient for me and the light indicator turns red to notify you the battery will be dying in the next 10 minutes. That is a nice feature which prompts one to hurry and finish trimming before the battery dies. The Norelco BG2030 truly deserves a 5 star rating and its price on Amazon is the lowest I was able to find.</li>
    <li> This is a great groomer!!  Doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor, but definately safer.  Gets the job done as long as you use it on the neck down, I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought my BG2030 after reading several positive reviews on the product.  I charged it overnight, and used it to trim some parts and shave others--being generally satisfied. As many previous reviews stated, the shave was not really close, but the trimmer worked fairly well.  I would like the attachment to allow slightly longer trimming, if I had my druthers.  Two days later, I decided to use it again.  However, it would not stay on.  I would have to depress the on switch several times before it wouldgo on, and then it would automatically go off after 5-20 seconds. This pattern repeated continually.  I fully recharged it (overnight), and upon trying it, it worked perfectly.  Two days later, the same internittent operation problem.  At no time did the \\&quot;low battery\\&quot; light show--and it shouldn&#x27;t have, since I had only used it about 20 minutes.  I left it alone three more days--and it was completely dead.  So,I must have a lemon--it would not hold a charge for more than a few days--and when partially discharged, would not operate properly.</li>
    <li> The BG2030 works pretty well. I do still find myself making a lot of passes to try to get all the hair to be the same length in a given area. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s probably as good as you can hope for from a body groomer.</li>
    <li> The grooming system does a smooth job and does not pull and scratch. I however do not understand the why of the warning included in the system prohibiting its use above the neckline. What is the special safety feature of the sysytems for use above the neckline that this system is deficient in? Once the bit of paper with the warning is thrown away - and someone unknowingly uses the system to shave the chin or the cheek,  what will happen? If it is really dangerous, the warning should be boldly inscibed in the body of the system itself and not included in the box as a scrap of paper which is sure to be thrown away on day one.</li>
    <li> Works well for what it&#x27;s advertised to do, however a design flaw in the top part of the base of the device will cause a tab to get broken off after several months of extensive use.  I used mine 2-3x a month for 6 months on my chest/back/legs and the head attachments no longer stay in place.  There are two images added to this item from a El Shadow that reveal the problem exactly.  I am going to downgrade to the BG2020.</li>
    <li> This products performance is nothing like the reviews it has received. Trimming was alright if you have hours to waste going over the same area over and over again in many different directions in attempt to get an even trim. As for its shaving ability...worthless. You would be better off using a bulky pair of hair trimmers or an electric shaver for your face than using this product. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> Thought this would be great after the reviews i read.  Even after an area is trimmed most of the way down you still have to press hard and go over the area 500 times to get it smooth.  I returned it right away.  I&#x27;ll go back to my regular razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this product almost a year ago and like most of the reviewers here, I have been extremely pleased with it. The reason I am updating this review is that today I noticed that the plastic collar that holds the attachment heads in place snapped off from what seemed to be normal wear and tear. I am not sure if this is a common issue or not but I did want to mention that all I had to do was call the number on the box and after a few simple questions they said they would ship a new one out to me right away.    I am extremely pleased with how Philips handled this situation and I know they will stand by their products. Case in point: a while ago the ear hook on my bluetooth headset (from another company) cracked from normal wear and tear and although there was still time left on the warranty, that manufacturer did not consider it to be covered. It&#x27;s hard to find products anymore with such good service and a two year warranty. This is one of them.</li>
    <li> The first time I turned it on the switch went bad and would not shut the unit off.  A piece of crap!</li>
    <li> perfect for removing body hair. not the most efficient for taking off all the hairs (as i&#x27;ve got pretty coarse hair) but for a quick &amp; easy alternative to a razor (which is not an option in some areas... mmm) does the job nicely</li>
    <li> It really works great and easy to use. I will only like to tell its drawback as rest other things are outstanding.    I feel itching when I use this on my chin and beard is not cleaned properly if you don&#x27;t put extra effort. Still I stopped using mach 3 after I purchased this and feeling comfortable with this.</li>
    <li> I had hoped that I could use the foil to trim the hairs on my back, but I realized that would take them down to nothing. If there was a comb for the foil, this would be a perfect shaver.    Using the trimmer for most of my body hair works well, but since it is so narrow, it takes a bit longer than I would like, If I could use the foil, or a wider trimmer head, it would go faster.    So I have resorted to holding the trimmer over my shoulder and hovering over the long hairs on my back, to get them to a more acceptable length (1/8\\&quot; to 1/4\\&quot;), and that seems to work well. Is someone else were doing my back for me, it would not be a problem to use the trimmer head for this. But since my partner would rather I not clip my body hair at all, I have to do it myself.    I have found that the BG2030 also is needed to complete haircuts with the QC5055 when trimming around the ears, and for trimming parts of my mustache with my beard trimmer.    This would be perfect with a comb to go over the foil. I wonder if the previous model, the BFG2020, uses the same foil, since it had a comb for it.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer posted a picture of the piece that broke on him/her after only a week. This same piece, a year and a half later, also broke on me. To follow up, I&#x27;m making an additional review on this product, and I am contacting Amazon to see about a return policy. Luckily, my credit card that I used to purchase this item gave me an extended warranty. Buyer should consider buying this item with a credit card for the extended warranty in case the same situation happens. Other than it breaking after a year, it was a good product.</li>
    <li> It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m even able to shave my face with this for a quick shave.</li>
    <li> I would not hesitate to buy another one.  It is a GREAT product and easy to hold and does a wonderful job.  You cannot cut yourself with this shaver.  I would recommend that your trim first before you use the razor.</li>
    <li> Product works quite well. Shaves the skin surface smoothly. It is easy to clean and holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> I love this unit. It&#x27;s got a great styling, lots of options for trimming (mowing) and shaving, and its battery lasts long enough to do my arms, pits, chest, and groin.    I was surprised at how well it did plowing through my thick arm hair. Don&#x27;t use this unit if you, or it, are sticky or damp. The attached guides are shiny poreless plastic and will tend to stick, or hop across your skin, if you are sweaty or in a humid environment.    For the &#x27;nether regions&#x27; (kiwis, banana, and starfruit), this thing does a knockout job. For trimming down there it&#x27;s pretty easy and effective. For shaving, you have to spend a lot more time making sure to get all the hairs, but it&#x27;s worth it. Doing several light, circular passes [AFTER \\&quot;MOWING DOWN\\&quot; ALL THE LONG HAIRS] with shaving cream works like a dream. You just have to make sure to shave down there every other day, or you&#x27;ll have a not-so-comfy case of the prickles.    My two warnings:    1. Do not get this if you can&#x27;t stand to plan your trim/shave. Because it has a ni-cad battery, it&#x27;s much better for the battery life to let it completely run out before recharging it. Don&#x27;t plug it in unless it&#x27;s dead.    2. I got a slight, though disarming, nick on my kiwis when using the shaver head. It was working fairly well, as usual, but the wrinkles inherent in this part of a male&#x27;s anatomy made for an &#x27;uh-oh&#x27; moment that caught me off guard. The culprit wasn&#x27;t the foil screen part of the shaver head, but the edge-trimmer section on the side of the shaver head.    To prevent #2 from happening, you need to:    A) make sure to hold the unit at the proper angle (head perpendicular to the skin surface at all times)    and    B) carefully chop down all hair on and around your \\&quot;kiwis\\&quot; with the trimmer head and attachment first.    and    C) strrrrrrrrretch your \\&quot;kiwi\\&quot; skin to be as flat and smooth as you can stand. Lumps and wrinkles might end up in the tiny teeth of the shaver head&#x27;s side-mounted edge trimmers.    Aside from that, this thing is incredible. It does its job, and it does it extremely well! I can&#x27;t imagine having the BG2020 model after this one. I&#x27;m now hairless down there and there are several hygienic and sexual advantages to this.    Thanks, Norelco, for helping me achieve new pleasures in the bedroom and new comforts in the boxers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers before, and while the 2030 doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor (what does) it&#x27;s certainly the next best thing.  It trims VERY effectively, and is very versitile.  Quickly cuts through the thickest and roughest hair without trouble.  Amazingly quick for it&#x27;s size.  The batteries are useful for about 50min. of shaving after a full charge, which is exactly what it says in the instructions.  Cleaning is also very quick and simple.  Only thing that could make me happier is if the foil could get razor close, but for now, I&#x27;m using a real razor when I need that.    Considering that there are comperable devices on the market for &gt;$100, the 2030 is bargain.</li>
    <li> Works very well and its nice that the base has a little trap door to store the extra parts when you are not using them.</li>
    <li> I agree with many of the men in their reviews.  It is a great product but the iner plastic broke on my groomer as well and although it still works, it does not work as well.</li>
    <li> after about a year the switch failed on mine - it wouldn&#x27;t shut off - I was disappointed</li>
    <li> I recieved this item as a gift and i don&#x27;t have very thick hair but I have a lot of it (on my legs) and I had to go over the same spot up to 20 times before the spot was bare.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with more than peach fuzz.</li>
    <li> If you use this product only for trimming body hair, I think you will be completely satisfied. However, this product performs pretty poorly when used on the face. For starters, if you want the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; look, it is not possible with this shaver, as the guard does not go low enough. It takes many, many passes with the shaver in many different directions before all the hair in one area is the same length. With other beard groomers I have used I have gotten considerably better results in much shorter time (about one-fourth the time). This trimmer leaves the hair quite uneven lengths, thus defeating the whole purpose of grooming.  The battery life is almost a redeeming factor. One charge seems to last an eternity (one charge, used 2-3 times a week lasted nearly three months!), but perhaps this explains the lack of shaving power.  In conclusion, I would highly recommend against buying this shaver if you plan to use it on your face in any capacity.</li>
    <li> Ordered a few weeks ago and received order quickly. There is a right way and a wrong to use this razor like every razor and its not a toy. That being said, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem unless you are missing thumbs or a frontal lobe.</li>
    <li> The Norelco BG2030 is perfect  It allows me to shave all those delicate little areas down below. Care must still be taken, it IS possible to get small cuts.</li>
    <li> Me gusto mucho la afeitadora. El diseño es muy elegante y los accesorios son muy convenientes. Los resultados obtenidos al utilizarla fueron los esperados, aunque cabe resaltar que el accesorio para la afeitada al raz no te deja TOTALMENTE afeitado, y tuve que utilizar la una afeitadora tradicional de navaja para terminar. Pero despues de esto es perfecta. La recomiendo Totalmente.</li>
    <li> Sharp corners scratch skin very badly.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;Nice design&lt;br /&gt;not too noisy&lt;br /&gt;works under water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;Cuts you like a knife&lt;br /&gt;blades are way too sharp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this last year and I just can&#x27;t get used to it. This little thing it&#x27;s just bloody dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;My chest literally gets cut and scratched whenever I trim without the plastic adapters.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving \\&quot;down there\\&quot; its the worse. Skin gets stock in the blades and things get bloody after that.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no excuse. This is a body groomer and seems like it wasn&#x27;t even tested before hitting the market.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s safer to use a razor or facial shaver than thin thing.&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this body groomer to anyone unless you want to use it to slice tomatoes with it.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Long lasting battery life, used efficiency both in/out of the shower.  The unique design prevents shaving cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a ton of items on Amazon before but have never left feedback.  Usually I only order products with good feedback so I never have a problem with the item.  Well this shaver is good when it has full battery life, but it drains quickly.  And it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge if you let it sit in your drawer for a week or two.  I don&#x27;t use or charge this every day so when I do need to use it I have to plan ahead and charge it the day before, which is a pain.</li>
    <li> I bought this for trimming up \\&quot;down there\\&quot;. It works very well for that. The adjustable head has setting so you can go from groomed to bare and any length in between. It&#x27;s hard to nick yourself but it can be done. The trick is to go slow and take your time. If you do that you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems. I have found that it is difficult to get that \\&quot;baby butt\\&quot; smooth feeling, even from the shaving head. You can get it but it takes a while. I would think of this more as a trimmer and not so much a shaver. If you want a shaver either buy a shaver or be prepared to spend some time getting rid of every last bit of stubble.    I&#x27;ve also found that this groomer works well for trimming facial hair and of course it can be used by ladies as well.    I have only used it dry, never wet so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works in that regard.    Overall I am very happy with it and would recommend it if you are in need of a trimmer. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think the shaving head doesn&#x27;t do the worlds best job of shaving since it leaves a bit of stubble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this as my hubby is in the other room using his personal groomer.  He loves it, but when we went on vacation last summer, he accidentally packed it into his suitcase with the attachment hooked on.  Not a good idea.  Something stressed it and broke a small piece off the main shaft that holds the attachments.  Long story short, it still works, but is rather wobbly.  I&#x27;m here at Amazon to order another one and that says a lot about how he likes it.  He&#x27;s not interested in a different brand or model, ONLY this one! Does a great job on all his parts, very smooth, no nicks, he loves it (and so do I...)</li>
    <li> stupid lil thing... looked good, worked good but lasted just one body grooming.. the cheap blade broke and i could never find a replacement.. either way the replacement heads are worth half the instrument.. cant be spending 35 bucks for every groomin session.. a waste i say</li>
    <li> I mostly use mine to self groom my back, it reaches all areas with little effort. For other areas it has a clever height guide and does a good job. It easily mows down the 12 holdout hairs on my dome and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp when doing so.</li>
    <li> First time I bought one of these groomers as I used to do it the old fashion way with scissors until I learned there are easier ways to trim.  Well, I was somewhat hesitant as I couldn&#x27;t bare to imagine any types of misscuts or irritation developing from use.  So after careful review, it appeared that this product was very well received and positive reviews.  It did not dissapoint, it is so easy to use and the settings are fantastic without any worries of nips/cuts.  I started with the largest setting as I was trying it out for the first time but went all the way down to the 1 and it worked like a charm.  You will not be disappointed in this purchase, great price, value, and handy tool to keep in any guys bathroom.</li>
    <li> Great little buzzer! No cuts, safe to use, battery lasts a good while. Just make sure you take the screen off of the head every so often to clean it and keep it running smooth. Recommended for grooming all areas.</li>
    <li> Wow, I hated this thing.  After many years of reliability, my trusty old Remington body trimmer battery is holding its charge less and less, and stores don&#x27;t seem to stock it very often anymore, so I thought I&#x27;d give the Norelco 2030 a try.  What a mistake.  As you might suspect after initial visual inspection, the insane blades on either side of the foil trimmer easily slice into sensitive skin areas with bloody results, first shaving attempt.  Your sack is anything but safe with this nasty device.  As for the low quality \\&quot;adjustable\\&quot; hair trimmer attachment, it is ridiculously difficult to move the length between numerical settings, compared to the Remington which is a quick and easy turn of the dial.  The Norelco hair trimmer attachment is nearly useless if you plan on changing the length during a session, as the fiddle factor is beyond annoying.    If self mutilation and the thrill of the cut are your thing, by all means give this product a try.  The sadistic design of this shaver is beyond comprehension, as are all of the positive reviews here.</li>
    <li> I love this body groomer. It makes manscaping a piece of cake. However, a BIG WARNING: do NOT use this trimmer on your nether regions without a guard on it! If your preference is to go bald, I&#x27;d strongly recommend trimming it down as low as possible then shaving the rest off. This trimmer will hurt you if you try to use it to shave yourself bald down there.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a guy, I appreciate all the time and details of many of the reviews here BUT there is a point where that guy mentality kicks in and I start thinking, man..does it work or not?  YES, it does, and quite well.  So I used to groom all areas with the pop up trimmer on my electric shaver.  This required a lot of care and resulted in areas that I could not do and lots of blood.  A task that I did, but certainly did not look forward to.  When I did it, it required the precision and attention of a surgeon.  This was my first (and only) \\&quot;body groomer\\&quot;.  Quite simply, I can use it EVERYWHERE and it works without blood and pain.  It gets EVERYWHERE and doesn&#x27;t miss areas or spots because of the shape or because frankly, I&#x27;m nervous about trying.  It simply works.  Now, that&#x27;s not to say that if you are completely careless and push the cutting edge against yourself it doesn&#x27;t cut.  It will.  BUT, the design gives you a great amount of \\&quot;sloppiness\\&quot; in how you handle it without accidentally doing that.  You really have to be careless to cause it to happen.  You no longer have to be a surgeon to be successful.  Others have pointed out that the battery doesn&#x27;t last long on a charge.  I have found the same.  Mine lasts long enough for me to complete the areas I want to do though, so I don&#x27;t know that in the end it matters much to me.  It&#x27;s not something I grab for everyday, perhaps others use it differently.</li>
    <li> First of all, Amazon was great in shipping this item to me, I was very pleased.  Then, I was even more impressed when I busted into this groomer.  It feels extremely solid in my hands.  I love the finish and sleekness, the pictures do not do this beauty justice.  Granted changing the lengths on the guards is a bit difficult especially when wet, it just takes a little finesse, not strength, to get it to slide.  This baby is also powerful, it has no problems mowing dat ish down.  When you&#x27;re all done, all the parts fit very neatly into the charging stand for a clean finish.  This thing is dope!</li>
    <li> I have been using this to shave my head and it works much better and gives a closer shave than the standard \\&quot;barber shop\\&quot; type clipper.</li>
    <li> I hate most of my body hair and like to trim it off. Looking at the reviews for this device prompted me to purchase one. Well, call it just me, but compared to my WAHL electric trimmer and a decent razor blade for finishing the cut, the BG2030 is:    1. Very slow with little power.  2. Too small a cutting area.  3. Feels and works more like a toy.  4. The manual warns NOT to use on facial hair. Why?    I appreciate my purchases and always take good care of them. A couple of weeks ago, I went to attach the shaving head, but it was loose on the body. Apparently, a plastic clip on the body that attaches to the shaver broke. Maybe I was just unlucky with this purchase. I returned the unit for a refund.    A final note, if you&#x27;re in a remote area without any electricity and need to shave or trim your body hair, and are willing to take some time in doing so, then this product might fit your needs. As for me, I have electricity and my WAHL and razor blade provide superior results.</li>
    <li> This is very similar to the first generation groomer except the charge is way cooler this time.  I groom all my groin area and also my underarms with this.  I dont know how long a charge lasts but the battery has never run out on me before.  I am a man but have also proven that this works for women too...HAHA..wink wink.</li>
    <li> Please see my post to T.J.&#x27;s excellent review of this fine product, in which I go over some of the benefits of body grooming as it relates to backcountry activities.</li>
    <li> I use this to manscape. And it does the job well, easy to clean, and 1 charge will last me a trip so I don&#x27;t have to take the charger with me. Just make sure no one uses it for their face after you shaved your balls with them, because that is gross. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and well priced.  I use it on a weekly basis.  Be careful not to drop it when using it in the shower though! (been there, done that)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 3 weeks now and absolutely love it.  I am fairly hairy and this trimmer had no trouble handling the job.  The various attachments seem to handle any situation without problems from complete hair removal on my shoulders, back and biceps to nice, even trimming on my chest, stomach and underarms.  I also used it to trim down the hair around the scrotum and pubic area which was very comfortable and easy.  Once this was done, I was able to use my cartridge razor to complete the job for a nice smooth effect.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> As background to this review, I have owned 2 Norelco BG2020s and now this BG2030. My BG2020s each worked great for about a year each, and both eventually required replacement for the same two reasons: poor battery life and inability to keep the foil head in place. In the end, the BG2020 could retain about 15 minutes of battery life, and its foil head would pop out with minimal pressure (a problem that steadily got worse over the months).    OK, on to the review of this product, the BG2030. Many other reviewers have analyzed this product quite thoroughly, so I&#x27;ll be somewhat brief. Basically, this is a nice improvement over the BG2020. It gives you a nifty built-in storage compartment in the back of the unit for the accessories, so they don&#x27;t stray to a cluttered drawer or sprawl all over the counter. The switchable head for long-hair trimming is quite nice, mowing through thicker, longer hair and larger areas much more quickly. Overall, the product seems to be very sturdy. The foil head piece snaps in place much more securely in this than in the BG2020. It shaves closely with little to no irritation (I have sensitive skin and thick, curly hair, so this means a lot coming from me). You have to be quite careless (or in a hurry) to cut yourself with this unit. I wish I could comment on the battery, but I have not had this long enough to make any final judgments on that. After all, a battery&#x27;s true test is in its longevity. If the battery wears down as quickly as the BG2020, then expect to be disappointed (and yes, I frequently completely drain and recharge the battery).    In summation: I am quite pleased, and I expect this unit to last for some time, definitely longer than my BG2020s lasted. We&#x27;ll see if that expectation holds true.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box this is extremely easy to use. I have been using my regular electric razor and so I was a little concerned about shaving in sensitive areas. But nothing to worry about. The trimming combs snap right and do a great job of creating that look you want. And the shaver is super sensitive - no cuts or snags. It&#x27;s not as powerful as a face razor, but for certain areas that is definitely a bonus. Absolutely buy - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for several weeks now.  I have used both the razor and trimmer heads for the bodygroomer.  The trimmer head cut through thick hair quickly without pulling any hair.  The shaver head did a very good job on my chest, armpit and groin hair.  I still haven&#x27;t figured out what the metal mesh on the shaver head actually does; it seems like there should be shaving action under the metal foil, but it seems the blades on the edges of head actually do the cutting.  This could be my incorrect perception, but either way, it gets the job done very nicely.  The battery seems to have long charge life.  The shaver is quiet.  It&#x27;s waterproof for use in the shower if you want.  It looks good and all the pieces are stored inside the charger base.  It&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> We got one first to make sure it is really what it claimed to be. I never liked shaving when wet so I always used this shaver dry. We love it so much we bought a second one for our house in Asia and another one for my cousin. No more painful shavers ever.</li>
    <li> Initially I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product because it didn&#x27;t seem to cut very well. I learned that if your hair is to long the product will not cut effectively. So instead of giving up I shaved all the hair down on my body and then started using the shaver. And I have to say it works awesome! Its much quicker than using a normal razor and I shaved 20x faster than before in comparison to a traditional shaver. Loving the product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he LOVES it.  He said it is the best one he has ever owned.  It has high quality parts so it will not be falling apart any time soon.  My husband suggests that all men own one of these.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is the best I&#x27;ve had.  It holds a charge for a long time, easy to clean, cuts very well, and it&#x27;s quiet.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little more expensive than some, but worth it.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> My husband had picked this model after researching various body groomers. This one had the best reviews, so he started shopping around for the best price. Amazon won hands down. He says the groomer trims excess hair very smoothly, no tugging or pulling. He is very happy with his purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this body groomer because in the summer I spend a lot of time shirtless and I wanted to remove the hair from my chest and back. Being a cyclist I&#x27;d already been shaving my legs for years and had been contemplating a full body wax. The cost of waxing and the potential pain and infections had me looking for other options and as usual I found myself here on Amazon. When I found this groomer I was a little unsure about purchasing it because of the mixed reviews, but I decided that if it did at least an adequate job it would be better than waxing.    After charging it overnight I first used the large trimming attachment to remove the longest hair from my chest, underarms, and more sensitive areas. My wife helped me with my back since I am not able to reach all of it comfortably. For quick, painless removal of the long hair the trimmer did an excellent job, even under my arms and in my groin area. I then put the shaving foil attachment back on to see how closely this unit would shave the remaining hair. Like others here, I found the shaving attachment slightly tedious to use, having to make multiple passes over the same areas to get the hair down. Even at that, the shave is not nearly as close as you will get with a razor. Particularly on my chest, the shaver left some pronounced stubble - not necessarily visible but definitely able to be felt. I then went back to my trusty woman&#x27;s Venus razor to finish the job and get the smoothness I was looking for. Again, my wife finished my back for me. On the positive side, the shaving foil didn&#x27;t nick or irritate my skin at all, even in sensitive areas like around my nipples and in and around my groin.    I didn&#x27;t think the trimmer was offensively loud at all, and it is easy to hold and maneuver. It also worked equally well in and out of the shower.    My overall assessment is that this unit is great as a trimmer to quickly remove most of your hair, and with plenty of time you can get reasonably close with the shaving foil with no irritation. But for a truly smooth shave I reverted back to a razor when I did all I could with this Norelco. I think I may consider waxing again for the summer months to get a smoother and longer lasting \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; appearance, and continue using this trimmer for maintenance and shaving during the cooler months when I will be less concerned with a totally smooth look and feel.</li>
    <li> My old bodygroom had seen better days and it&#x27;s third foil was due to be replaced. [...]    It&#x27;s a much better built machine and it feels like it. It&#x27;s also about half as quiet.  Beware however, it&#x27;s a bit narrower and can slip out of your hand much easier.  The foil on this one is really tight and doesn&#x27;t constantly fall out.    The tool holder works great and is really neat. You&#x27;d never know all that stuff was back there built into the base.  The battery life is the same as the old one; meaning, GREAT!  I tried the other head on someone else and it works fine. I can&#x27;t use it on me, because I was constantly screwing around with the old one, so I said the heck with it and completely shaved all my body hair off.  Now, I&#x27;ve come to prefer it that way and so does my wife.    Many people say this doesn&#x27;t shave completely smooth, I have very fine hair which is the toughest on it and while there is a little stubble, it&#x27;s barely noticable. In fact, it&#x27;s probably better then any foil shaver out there period!    Obviously, there was much interest in the old Bodygroom that they took the time to build this one.  And, it answers every complaint I ever had about the old one in spades.    Great Precision Machine! Hats off to the new Bodygroom.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Norelco BG fan for a long time now. I had the BG2020 for more than a year and then I got a little bored with it. It still did it&#x27;s job but I was looking for something better. I came across the BG2030 on Amazon (Thank-you, You guys ROCK!). I saw the description and immediately ordered it. I received my Norelco in mail yesterday and tested it out after a full charge. I have to say that it is just a fantastic piece of equipment. I am a fairly hairy guy and I like to keep my body hair trimmed (all over the place). BG2030 works like a charm. I love the new shiny look. The nifty and genius way of storing the attachments and brushes behind the charging station!!! The new attachments are improved and much better functional. On my test run I found myself going through all the attachments from time to time, which I hated doing on the BG2020 and usually stuck to one setting.  The shaver looks great, works even better!     Pros:   1. Design looks sexy and very well constructed  2. Great battery life  3. Attachment that actually work    Cons:  1. A little louder than BG2020  2. Why is the charger gray when everything else is shiny black???    Conclusion: You cannot go wrong with the Norelco BG2030! If you groom your body hair regularly then this is your \\&quot;Swiss-knife\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Best groomer i ever had!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The product has blown me away, the several diffrent head attachments work well, The system works extremly well.    The big sell for me was the wet Dry application. I Actaully find myself shaving less than I did before becuase the razer gets so close &amp; with no iritaion.    The price was nothing special, I paied $50.00 for it on Amazon &amp; have seen it for the same amount in Target as recently as last week. But the shipping was  free so no big deal, I just expect to save a few $$ when I shop on Amazon, Anyway, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer for trimming my underarms and more personal areas along with my beard.  it is amazing.  it is so gentle on the tender areas and has great comb control for my beard.  I have purchased several other trimmers over the years but this one surpasses them all.  It is a bit more pricey than some trimmers but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to this body groomer because I am hairy. Not crazy hairy but there are places where I want my hair trimmed/shaved. I first gave this shaver 5 stars because of it&#x27;s efficiency. Also, it just looks cool. I was able to pretty much just shave without worry that I&#x27;ll cut myself or nick...something. However, since my hair is somewhat thick/coarse the shaver is not as effective as I thought it would be. Just shaving my \\&quot;happy trail,\\&quot; I still see the ends of my hair sticking out. Like cactus. Not good. I think this is a great trimmer, but you should buy a nice razor so you can finish off what you started.</li>
    <li> God makes some people short and some people tall, some people are born ugly and some people are born good-looking, some people are hairless and some are hairy!!!   God made me hairy (psss...I am tall and good-looking too) now to those who do not have this issue...you are truly blessed...but if you are like me...you really know the trouble and pain of maintaining the hair on your body. To this Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System is a blessing in disguise.   This was my first time buying a Philips electronic razor and I have to say...I am impressed by it. It removes the hair and makes your skin soft and looking as if there were no hair to begin with!!! I use it for my under-arm, groin area, stomach and facial hair trimming. It does not pain when you use it, it cleans well and looks great too!! All in all, it is a wonderful product.   The attachments are also very useful. The razor is also of good quality, no breaking or cracking as the other reviews for other models of Philips Norelco say.  I usually don&#x27;t even write reviews, but for this, I had to...cause it has made my life so easy! Thank you engineers behind Philips Norelco BG 2030, you guys ROCK!</li>
    <li> Do not like it due to the face that the head of the cutter comes off and will not stay tight&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I am a female and bought this shaver thinking that it would do a better job with shaving legs, bikini area, etc. than the women&#x27;s shavers that are out there, since it was made for men&#x27;s coarse hair.  It shaved dry skin just as good as any other \\&quot;good\\&quot; electric shaver, leaving some stubble behind, and I thought, oh well! BUT then, I only got to use it once! After one use, it never worked again. Since I was not going to use it often, only in case when I had to do a quick touch up, I charged it and stored it away as to have it ready for next time I needed it. However, when I decided to use it again it was not working at all. I fully charged it again and when I turned it on it seemed to work fine. But I did not use it, instead I stored it for next time. When I tried using it again, it was dead once more. I guess this thing is defected and it does not charge or hold its charge. This sucks, I never had this issue with the women&#x27;s rechargeable shavers or, anything rechargeable for that matter. I am very disappointed. This is not a cheap item and it should work fine for the price it costs.</li>
    <li> Cheap and does what it says!  That&#x27;s all i want from the product I buy.</li>
    <li> The Norelco BG2030 performed well as a body grooming system and even as a shaver for 2 years and 2 months of light use.  At that time, the engagement section of the head broke.  This made the unit completely non-functional.  Very disappointed in the unit performance due to the short functional life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you look for another product and do not purchase this one.</li>
    <li> So far, I have been enjoying the performance of this product. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now, and only charged it once. It cuts much faster and efficiently than its predecessor.</li>
    <li> THis product works exactly as described.. Close shave with no nicks right where you would count on that</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this without the guard for the \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; look, but it has kept me neat and trim for several months without irritation.  It has worked well in the shower and dry.  The battery also lasts a long time.  I probably only charge it once every two months for weekly use.</li>
    <li> Razor works well. Main problem is the battery life. On a full charge the device instantly begins to lose power and completely dies in about 10 minutes. I&#x27;m disappointed that Philips would sell a flawed product- it&#x27;s a flaw to me. I have had other electric razors and battery life didn&#x27;t seem to be an issue.</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver based on all the good reviews, but after using it once, I&#x27;m back to my manual razor.  The Norelco took many more swipes to get the job done and it also pulled at my hair.  It took longer to use than a manual razor, so I&#x27;m back to square one.  Maybe it works better for men than women....</li>
    <li> Its one of the good product from Philips. Its more comfortable and easy to use. delivery was fast and the product cost me less on amazon.</li>
    <li> **Norelco has come out with a new model, the BG2040.  For a quick read on the new model vs this one, jump down to the bottom of this review.  If you don&#x27;t want to read any further than this paragraph, get the BG2040**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this review I am going to cover the BG2030 and also compare it to the previous model, the BG2020.  There are some big differences between the two models and just because the BG2030 is the newer model, it may not be the one for you.  Also, this is a body groomer and as such, body anatomy will be discussed.  If you are easily offended, stop reading this review now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me, you saw this body groomer and wondered what the big difference between this and a regular electric razor was.  Well, after having been in those shoes, let me explain.  If you&#x27;ve ever tried to cautiously use an electric razor or an electric trimmer on parts of your body below your neck, then you probably had a mixed experience.  On some parts of your body it works, whereas on other parts it was painful and simply not possible.  Those days are now gone.  Regular electric razors/trimmers were never designed to shave the entire body.  However, body groomers have been designed to shave the ENTIRE body and have blades that are closer together to prevent pinching the skin, thus providing a pain-free experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the sake of clarity we need to address the parts of the shaver.  In the picture you will see that there are two different heads that you can attach to the handle.  The attachment with the foil on the inside and the cutters on the outside will be referred to as the foil attachment.  The other attachment that doesn&#x27;t have a foil will be referred to as the trimmer attachment.  Also, there are 2 trimming combs and each trimming comb has 5 different settings, allowing you to trim your hair from anywhere to .12in(3mm) to .43in(11mm).  Those are just the length settings when using the combs; you can get a smooth shave when you use the foil attachment.  Also, all the pieces can be stored in the back of the charging stand.  Unfortunately, there is no travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarm Hair:&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the BG2030, the BG2020 really struggled here and it took a lot of time.  Now however you can use the trimmer attachment to knock down most of the forest.  However, once the forest is down, minor maintenance with the foil attachment doesn&#x27;t take long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chest and Ab Hair:&lt;br /&gt;No problems at all.  I was a little concerned about the nipple area but both the foil and the trimmer attachment were able to be used without any pinching at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Groin:&lt;br /&gt;In the words of another reviewer, the \\&quot;Bodygroom\\&quot; is Shaft, Beanbag, and Starfish safe. No nicks or any pain...no worries at all.  You can trim the forest to any length, and then follow up with foil attachment if that is your desire.  Because of the design of the groomer, you can shape things any way you would like.  I experienced no skin irritation, however, I would imagine that most people will experience at least some irritation.  I have used the shaver both in and out of the shower and have noticed that I get a smoother shave when I&#x27;m in the shower.  This is due to the warm water relaxing the skin and opening up the follicles, which makes it easier to shave.  Like any electric razor, there are going to be some hairs that lay flat that you&#x27;re just not going to get no matter how hard you try.  When it comes to effectiveness, I actually think that my Mach 3 does a better job in getting everything smooth, but the body groomer is more convenient, and also allows you to trim certain areas instead of going completely smooth if that is your desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery:&lt;br /&gt;NiMH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel:&lt;br /&gt;Come on, Norelco, no travel case?  Why do you do this?  And what&#x27;s with not giving us dual voltage?  This has to be the only Norelco razor that isn&#x27;t dual voltage, and that makes no sense at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------BG2030 compared to the BG2020----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most obvious difference is that the BG2030 comes with the additional trimmer attachment.  Also, you now only have 2 combs with multiple settings vs. 3 combs that had fixed settings.  Sounds like the BG2030 is perfect, right?  Well, what isn&#x27;t obvious in the picture is that the BG2030 trimming combs only attach to the trimmer attachment and DO NOT fit the foil attachment!  This is a HUGE change because the BG2020 model allowed you to attach trimming combs to the foil attachment.  Norelco, what were you thinking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that this is a problem is because if you want to do both a trim and a shave, then you have to swap out head attachments whereas before you just had to remove the combing attachment.  If you keep the body groomer in the shower, then that means you also have to keep both head attachments in the shower.  Personally, it&#x27;s frustrating to have to change out the head attachment and now when I travel I have to take both heads instead of just the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on doing any traveling with your shaver (without the charging stand), you&#x27;ll probably want the BG2020, mainly because you can put a combing attachment over the foil to protect it.  Also, you don&#x27;t have to take the additional head.  If you want to travel with the BG2030, then you&#x27;ll need to find a way to protect the foil or else you&#x27;ll have to take the charging stand with the storage compartment to keep the foil attachment in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------- Overall Opinion ----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a FANTASTIC shaver, but I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars because Norelco chose to do away with combing attachments for the foil head.  If they&#x27;d provide that like they did in their previous model, the BG2020, then the BG2030 would be untouchable.  They also need to add a travel case and a lanyard to it so you can hang it in the shower vs. having to lay it down and damage the foil.  If you are looking for a groomer to just trim and shave your groin area and chest area, then I think the BG2020 might be a better fit for you.  If on the other hand you&#x27;re going to be shaving big areas that have a lot of hair to knock down and you don&#x27;t mind switching heads all the time, then the BG2030 will probably work better for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------BG2030 compared to the BG2040 and New Opinion----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried the BG2040 however, it appears as though Norelco fixed many of the problems that were found in the BG2030 with the removable heads and attachments.  After 2 years of using the BG2030 I can tell you right now that even though I only do weekly maintenance, it&#x27;s incredibly annoying switching between the foil head and the trimmer head every time I use it (even though it does a GREAT job).  Also, the BG2030 is just not practical to travel with, something which I frequently do.  With a foil head on one end and a trimmer head on the other end, the BG2040 appears to be Norelco&#x27;s best effort-to-date AND it&#x27;s dual voltage.  If I were to buy a new razor today, I&#x27;d absolutely go with the BG2040.  The extra money you&#x27;ll spend on it is well worth it, if only for getting rid of all the attachments that litter the bathroom counter or shower.  Thank you Norelco for listening to your customers, but why did you design the BG2040 and the charging stand for easy travel but not throw in a travel case?  The lanyard option was always nice for the wet/dry razors too.  It seems like it&#x27;s always easier to hang a razor in the shower than lay one down.  So how about that while you&#x27;re at it?tional trimmer attachment.  Also, you now only have 2 combs with multiple settings vs. 3 combs that had fixed settings.  Sounds like the BG2030 is perfect, right?  Well, what isn&#x27;t obvious in the picture is that the BG2030 trimming combs only attach to the trimmer attachment and DO NOT fit the foil attachment!

If I were to buy a new razor today, I&#x27;d absolutely go with the BG2040.  The extra money you&#x27;ll spend on it is well worth it, if only for getting rid of all the attachments that litter the bathroom counter or shower.  Thank you Norelco for listening to your customers, but why did you design the BG2040 and the charging stand for easy travel but not throw in a travel case?  The lanyard option was always nice for the wet/dry razors too.  It seems like it&#x27;s always easier to hang a razor in the shower than lay one down.  So how about that while you&#x27;re at it?</li>
    <li> This model is significantly better than the first Bodygroom.  The changeable head with the size combs are great. If you use too much pressure the combs can slide back in place resulting in the razor cutting too close.  You can always hold a finger in place over the size slider to prevent it from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives a great shave and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this razor is the way they installed the batteries.  Mine stopped working after about 6 months.  I decided to take it apart to see if I could determine why.  The whole razor is essentially snapped together and held in place with glue.  There was only one screw I needed to remove once I got inside.  Inside I discovered they are using two regular AAA rechargeable batteries with solder pads. On one end they make the connection between the two batteries by using a solder-able piece of metal. Except instead of soldering them together they wedged the metal connector in and relied on friction to hold it in place.  On mine the metal had slipped out of place and broken the circuit.  I soldered the metal back together and now it works like new.  If the batteries ever die they can be easily replaced with solder-able AAA batteries that can be ordered online.  Seems to me like designed obsolescence to use off the shelf batteries and seal them inside the casing.  They could have just as easily made a removable back plate so anyone could easily swap them when they die.</li>
    <li> I had used the BG2020 before, but the button on it broke somehow and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  That worked pretty well, but the BG2030 works way better!  Love the new attachments and head.  Great for cutting down the chest hair (and mine gets thick).  The foil head also seems to work a little better than the 2020.  I would definitely recommend this product for any guy that wants to trim up.  No pinches down there either, very smooth.  Just used it for the first time today, and in 10 minutes I was all cleaned up.  The $50 price is a bit high, but trust me you are getting a quality product.  Don&#x27;t see how they could really improve on it much, except to include a travel case, or at least offer one as an additional product.  Well worth it, and if I had to buy one every couple of years I would.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.    If I could recommend an improvement: allow the device to charge from the cord and not from the docking station. Traveling makes it difficult</li>
    <li> The body groom 2030 ia a very good trimmer for removing  unwanted hair in the private area.  It removes hair and leaves the area nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Buena afeitadora, lo unico chimbo es que dice que solo para ser usada del cuello para abajo, sin embargo, yo me afeito la cara con ella!</li>
    <li> After a few years, I finally destroyed my old one.  This is really nice upgrade that is much more comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself for personal grooming and even though the battery life is truly amazing, this thing will last for a week with everyday use, I would not recommend using it anywhere where you have to be \\&quot;gentle\\&quot;. While this groomer is impeccable in terms of getting the longer hairs off, and the many attachments come in handy, it still leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to hair pulling. My boyfriend and I both used it in private spots, and we now avoid the use of this groomer \\&quot;down there\\&quot; like the plague.    Verdict: Very good product for all body parts with longer hair, horrible for \\&quot;down there\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve done my body hair trimming using a Wahl trimmer designed for facial hair. That worked okay, but the small comb meant that it took a long time to do. Since it was something I only did every few months (or for bathing suit season) it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. But: I&#x27;ve told myself for years that rather than let my body hair get all gray and bushy and out-of-control as I grew older, I&#x27;d keep it trimmed. Well, at 41 I&#x27;m beginning to notice gray hairs on my chest, and an overall increase in body hair (why does that happen, I wonder?). I decided it was time to add \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; to my regular grooming routine before things got out of control. It was also time to retire the beard trimmer and try something designed for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like the Norelco BodyGrooming System. It took me awhile to figure out how the trimming worked. When using a beard trimmer, I went WITH the hair growth. The way this is designed, you set the length you want, and trim AGAINST the hair growth while holding the groomer at an angle I thought of as \\&quot;upside down.\\&quot; Once I figured that out, though, I was able to quickly and easily trim my body hair. As another reviewer mentioned, I was surprised and pleased at how much more quickly the process went. The right tool DOES make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair on my back, which is unstylish. I used to try to keep my back totally smooth, but frankly, anything that involves pulling out the hair (waxing, tweezing) means I have a back covered with red, infected, ingrown hairs, and I personally think that&#x27;s a LOT less attractive than back hair. So, I&#x27;m satisfied with keeping the hair trimmed down to a level at which it&#x27;s pretty much unnoticeable, hopefully without too much of a scratchy stubble feeling. It takes a bit of twisting and contortion, but it&#x27;s not as hard as people seem to expect. The BodyGrooming system does an okay job there -- although it&#x27;s no better than my Wahl trimmer on that particular job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shaving down to the skin, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. It takes a few passes before the hair is shaved down to the skin, and it never is as smooth as the shave I can get with the cheap electric shaver I received as a gift several years ago. The shave is good enough, and I still recommend the system, but it&#x27;s not as good as I was hoping. Also, as other reviewers have noted, it&#x27;s a bit tricky having two trimming blades on each side of the shaving foil. I haven&#x27;t cut, nicked or pinched myself, but I can see that it&#x27;s possible, especially if you have more sensitive skin than I do. Yes, I have used the trimmer in my \\&quot;private areas,\\&quot; and had no trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t at all mind switching out the heads. That&#x27;s easy to do. The storage system is ingenious, neatly tucking away the trimming head and combs into the back of the charging stand. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the battery life or charging system. Cleaning the system is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to keep his body hair under control. It&#x27;s definitely a step up from the beard trimmer/electric shaver combo I was using. It&#x27;s quick and easy to do some \\&quot;touching up\\&quot; every morning before I shower, and do more intensive grooming on the weekends. I haven&#x27;t tried this in the shower yet, and don&#x27;t really intend to -- I prefer to trim my body hair while I&#x27;m dry, so I don&#x27;t know how this works in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: September 4, 2010&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still happy with this trimmer. It&#x27;s going strong, and I&#x27;ve recommended it to a couple of friends, both of whom are also quite pleased with it. Nothing has changed with the review above except for the fact that I did try using it in the shower a couple of times, and really don&#x27;t see the point. It was more difficult, and a lot of hair didn&#x27;t get trimmed at all because it was wet and stuck to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One slight annoyance is that recently I notice that the shaving attachment wants to pivot off if it&#x27;s at an odd angle (for instance, if I&#x27;m twisted around to trim my back). It seems to have loosened somewhat over time. It&#x27;s still a pretty minor thing, and is easy to work around, but can be annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer mentioned something about the battery charging that had also bothered me. The instructions mention that if you charge the battery for more than eight hours (I think it was eight, maybe it was twelve), you risk damaging the battery. Well, who the heck wants to plan the charging time so that you happen to be around to unplug it in eight hours? I never noticed any damage, but it still bothered me. I finally had the idea of plugging the charger into a simple light timer and setting the timer to shut off in eight hours. Works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: December 6, 2011&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;slight annoyance\\&quot; I mentioned in my last update has turned into a real pain. The stupid shaving attachment falls off every time now, unless I manage to keep a finger on it to hold it in place while I&#x27;m trying to shave. Yeah, that doesn&#x27;t work so well. I&#x27;m going to have to buy a new trimmer. I belive the latest version of this has both the trimmer and shaver pemanently attached, so this must be a common problem. I no longer recommend this particular model, and I&#x27;m downgrading my rating to two stars.back). It seems to have loosened somewhat over time.

    <li> I like the BG2030 , good and easy to use , what i didnt like is thats its noisy,the electricity is 120v and not Global , it was better if its 110v-240v cos i used to travel for many countries which uses 240v,also it was better if the charger can be fixed directly to the body grommer ,,, thats why its 4 stars .</li>
    <li> After the full 9 hour charge time I used this puppy to great success.  Just make sure you&#x27;re careful around very, er, loose skin.  The blade can cut skin if you let it.  It&#x27;s a great product, if used properly!</li>
    <li> This tool shaves in all the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas with no nicks or cuts.  I&#x27;m completely shaved so I don&#x27;t know about the trimming aspect, but if it&#x27;s anything like the shaving...then you&#x27;ll be satisfied.  BTW...it works great on my wife also!</li>
    <li> Bought this mainly for use around certain parts of the body that I&#x27;ve had difficulty using other trimmers around, like around the groin area or armpits.  Worked excellent for those functions.  The trimmer is on the long side of stubble, but better than some alternatives I&#x27;ve tried.  However I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for creating stubble.  It also really has a nice feel/balance to it, and is covered in a nice soft rubber like coating.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these and it worked fine for about 3 months and then the on off button stuck in the on position. I called and they told me to send it back to them and they would reapir or replace the item. I was happy to see a new groomer arrive in about 2 weeks. I have had the new one for about a year and guess what.. same problem with the on off switch. Called again and they said sorry your warrenty is up. They go by the original purchase date of the first unit. I argued to no avail......I got nothing .I see other people have had switch issues.It is a shame when they know of weakness in a certian area they just keep giving you the same crap, LOOK ELSWHERE FOR A GROOMER</li>
    <li> researched for days!! wanted something like this &amp; got it!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt shave very close and the sides scratch the heck out of your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its well worth it for a quick trim, and its super tough.</li>
    <li> I have purchased an earlier version of this product and this one blows it away.  It works perfectly and I could not be happier with it.</li>
    <li> nice body groomer, it cuts hair well and somewhat close, u do however feel kind of stubly. This is my first body groomer so i dont have anything to compare it too, I have thick black hair and it does it with probably just two passes. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Battery life on this unit simply makes this unit not worth it.  I barely get 2 uses out of it before the battery is completely dead.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s waterproof! That&#x27;s probably what I like most about this product. Really is incredibly handy for large areas, and the easily adjustable height is very convient.</li>
    <li> The angle of the shears on this is not effective as a body groomer.  The main head is more for face stubble grooming, definitely not body hair. I bought this as a gift for my husband and it now just sits in the drawer.  He uses his old one that has a dying battery and missing heads because it is still more effective than this pos.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Good Quality quick charge. Beats the heck out of my former remington trimmer which cut my skin up.</li>
    <li> It was the first body groom that I have ever tried. I guess this works better than razor or other products are made for men.</li>
    <li> Compared to a Wahl trimmer I had been using, I found it to be noisy and not as effective in cutting body hair.  The groomer has good reviews... so, obviously it works for others.  Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is much better than the other one.  The pictures look the same but the razors up close do not.    It even came with a charge on it.    I had the cheaper model before.  After a fairly long useful life, the older model turned it self on and irreversably sucked its own button in.  Once I figured out what was buzzing, I quickly figured out that it could never be used again, and not being able to turn it off at all, used it down to its last charge.    Aside from its other many uses, I was surprised to find that this one and the older model are probably the only razors in the world that you can shave your sensitive parts with without injury!</li>
    <li> This gives a very good trim. It&#x27;s very small and looks good and comes with a nice charging dock. (Though you can&#x27;t use while it&#x27;s charging since it doesn&#x27;t charge straight from the wall only through the dock.) What I really like about it is that you just rinse it off under the faucet which makes cleaning so easy. You can also use it in the shower, which I have tried but doesn&#x27;t seem to do such a good job like that. And for shaving, you have to go over the same spot several times in order to get a close clean shave. Hope this was helpful!</li>
    <li> Great product! Great trimmer very even! The shaving is good...there are some parts on your body that will not get smoother as others but great product none the less! :)</li>
    <li> The trimmer is very good.. but the saving portion is horrible, im a bit on the chunky side and i had to almost press against my skin to make this thing work. Had to save the same section multiple times and ended up bleeding and irritate skin.. i went back to old shaver after only 2 uses with this.</li>
    <li> The shaving function works great. It does not cause pain and it is very easy to do it. The cut function did not work so well. The comb traps the hair but it does not cut it that well.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, I&#x27;ve had mine for 3 years with no problems.</li>
    <li> Hey I was going to add a video review but then this might turn into a porn site!!! Hahahaha.    Anyways I actually like the 2030 ten times better than the 2020 because first of all, it looks so freakin cool!!! Thanks to the designer guy that said hey why dont we use this big plastic base to store the accesories, give that guy a raise!!! I always lost my accessories with the 2020. I purchased 3 of these. 1 for me and 2 as gifts, yeah cuz I only give a gift I would buy for myself. I agree with Orion, having an optional foil head without the 2 trimmers on it would make it even easier to trim the sack. Hopefully Philips Norelco reads these reviews &amp; gives us the option to purchase that.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 3 months now.  I got this product because I wanted to groom my body hair while in the shower.  Though, this product does work for that, it can take A LOT of passes before it finally cuts the hair to skin level when in the shower.    When I use this product dry it does an amazing job.  The cut is both fast and close.    The fact that this product uses an NiCd is really a bummer because you cannot recharge the unit after every use.  You have to wait for the battery to almost completely drain before recharging it.  That means, there will always be one time you planned on trimming that you can&#x27;t because the battery will die and you have to wait 11 hours for it to recharge.  Also, the instructions warn to never leave it on the charger more than 12 hours or it can damage the unit.  I hate things like that because it&#x27;s easy to forget something you just do once a month and ruin your nice new trimmer.    The base stores the extra pieces while not in use, so that is nice except if you want to use this in the shower as the base is obviously not kept there.    This product has only cut me one time.  (NOT PLEASANT, as it made at least a 1/8 inch long slice out of my skin, ouch!)</li>
    <li> Simply put it&#x27;s Norelco&#x27;s best ever. This body groomer is the most comfortable body razor ever invented. Comfort and safety is of paramount concern regarding body razors, and this is by far the most safest and most comfortable ever. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This grooming system is the best on the market.  I&#x27;ve purchased about 10 of these over the years.  I&#x27;ve given them to friends and family as gifts and everyone is in love with it.  Word of mouth has spread about this razor and I ended up buying this one for a friend.  He is happy as can be.  You can shave your arms, under arms, trim a goatee, shave your uhm...down there.  This razor does it all and have never cut me once.  I&#x27;ve had my grooming kit for about 3 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally had to charge it again! This thing works very well, can use it on pretty much any body hair. The combs give you the length you want (cut a little longer at first!) and it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the groomer feels good in your hand, doesn&#x27;t make too much noise, and cuts painlessly.</li>
    <li> This is my first or second Amazon review, but after using this product, I didn&#x27;t have a choice.  I just had to write.  I am a review junkie.  I read everyone&#x27;s reviews and base my buying decisions on them, so I figured it was my time to give back.    I would like to say that I have been through many, many trimmers.  I keep myself groomed from head to toe.  There have been many hair trimmers that work well for my beard/ goatee or whatever I am trying to grow for that week.  The Andis line really does well for hair and facial hair, however, while removing hair is not a problem in the nether regions with these trimmers, it is not safe, even scary.  Yes.  I said Scary.  Nothing wakes you up in the morning like the jagged edge of ground steel biting into your skin like that chubby kid at McDonalds and with his happy meal. Yeah, you know the one.   I got this for my wife because she waned a trimmer and after all the good reviews, this seemed to be a nice one.  After she unwrapped it, I freed it from its plasticy jail with my Black and Decker electronic scissors which were a great purchase as well.  She was a bit weary, and asked me to try them out.  Well after all the positive reviews, I went right for the delicate area and not a knick, cut, scratch, pull or any thing negative.  It was fantastic.  It does not take the hair down as close a my fusion, but the fusion is not convenient at all and is very time consuming.  The foils help to get the little stubble down even closer and also does not pull which I was happy about.       At first glance, the design seems to be a bit awkward, but it actually works incredibly well because of the way the head curves and it having trimmers on both sides of the foil.  It makes awkward spots much easier to trim and because the teeth on the trimmer are designed not to cut or pinch you, it make this job much faster.      Anyway, I like this so much that I just ordered another one for myself.  Good luck and happy trimming.</li>
    <li> This is a steal at just $10 more than the model below it.  I had the ~$30 trimmer and it works but this model works soooo much better.  Love it.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product. I&#x27;m no going to go into total detail but it gets the job done. in this day in age, every man needs one of these, no matter how much body hair you have to groom. I love it. I take it in the shower with me every few days and i go to town with it, coming out super fresh.    This one is much better than the regular system. bodygrooming. Get the PROFESSIONAL one.</li>
    <li> The body groomer works great when used as spec&#x27;d. For sensitive areas, def make sure you take your time and go slow. The charge lasts forever, love the fact it works wet or dry. Haven&#x27;t used all the attachments, but I&#x27;m sure I will down the road. Great product.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  Been using this for several weeks now.  Works awesome.  I&#x27;ve been using this for facial hair as well.  Honestly, this is probably the best and versatile shaving system I&#x27;ve had.  I&#x27;m definitely a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;____&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mainly using it in the nether regions.  The saving foil attachment worked well over loose skin area.  Just remember to put the attachment on the trimmer(non shaving foil attachment) before you start saving. You might get some bad nicks if you don&#x27;t.  The saving foil attachment worked awesome as-is.</li>
    <li> While the product mentions not to use it above the neck, it provides 2 heads. Therefore, I use one exclusively for trimming facial hear and the other head for body grooming. Battery is good as long as the shaver is put on the charger after use. Cleaning is easy with the brush provided and the shaver fits comfortably in the hands.</li>
    <li> While not originally bought to use on my face, this is the first \\&quot;cordless\\&quot; or \\&quot;electric\\&quot; unit that even comes close to my regular razor.  I have to say, I may use this more than my other electric if I feel too lazy to shave.  I hadn&#x27;t shaved in 2 or 3 days and it does a pretty good job.  Mind you, it takes a week for me to get any real growth on the face.  I can get away with shaving 5 to 6 times a month.  So for normal people, if you use this every day or every other day it should keep it close enough to show up at work.  It also does a great job everywhere else I&#x27;ve useed it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often review but I must say that I am disappointed with this from a usually reliable company. Be aware, after the blade contraption pops of in use the first time get used to it... it will become more loose as you use it. The little plastic clips just don&#x27;t have the tension to hold it well, and the noise/vibration will be more noticeable too. It did a fine job at first, but I will look elsewhere. My model looks the same, but is over 1 year old.</li>
    <li> The device itself worked very well. But the internal rechargeable battery died after 8 months (in the middle of a shave of course :-/).&lt;br /&gt;AND since you cannot replace it, I had to trash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to recycle the internal battery so I opened the device (impossible to do without breaking it). Turns out it uses two regular AAA size batteries. If only they added a little trap, one could replace the batteries themselves and this electric razor would live on forever. I wonder if they didn&#x27;t do that on purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JD</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy.  For the past 8 years I&#x27;ve tried about 10 different razor/clipper/trimmer products to clean up my chest/stomach area and I&#x27;ve yet to find one that I really, truly liked.  Either it was a straight electric razor which cut everything down to zero (not the goal), or some sort of \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; device which invariable failed to work properly.    The BG2020 was the closest I&#x27;d gotten to something useful...It would take me a solid 30 minutes and LOTS of back-and-forth over the same areas, but if you held it juuuust so, you could get the job done.  It was a pain -- I&#x27;d have to dedicate some time, and because my bathroom lights are pretty hot, after standing there trimming for 20 minutes I&#x27;d start to sweat, so I&#x27;d have to take a break and come back and finish later.  All-in-all, a process, but the job got done.    I got the BG2030 in the mail this morning and all I can say is that I&#x27;m *stunned* at how well it works.  I hooked up the trimmer attachment and gave it a quick whirl before I got into the shower...just to see how it worked.  I was so amazed at how quickly it trimmed everything down, that I just did the whole job right there in about 5 minutes.  No exaggeration -- what used to take a solid 30 minutes took LESS than 5 minutes with the BG2030.  Nothing more needs to be said -- if you want a quick, simple, easy way to trim down body hair, this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Period.    Now, for other areas (the \\&quot;nether regions\\&quot;), it&#x27;s not quite so miraculous -- that&#x27;s not to say it doesn&#x27;t work, and it does, but it&#x27;s no better than the BG2020, which worked perfectly.  So this will continue to work perfectly down there as well.    All in all, a 5-star product and worth the extra money over the BG2020 without hesitation.</li>
    <li> i bought it as a present for my boyfriend and it works great! it leaves a very close shave when needed, making anything nice and smooth.... or not if you dont want it that way</li>
    <li> Well there are many reviews that said all the details and how easy and comfortable is this body groomer, I only want to say that if you are looking for one, this is the right one, don&#x27;t keep looking for others, to good purchase for be true...really</li>
    <li> Works great for extra sensitive areas man or woman.  Just keep it clean and charged.  You may wish to consider purchasing extra cutting heads, just in case...</li>
    <li> I USE THIS FOR ALL MY BODY NEEDS, IT SELF CLEANS BUT I CLEAN IT MYSELF BECAUSE I ALSO USE IT TO SHAVE MY HEAD ( ITS THAT GOOD) ITS BETTER THAN MY $390 HEAD CLIPPERS,,,IF U BUY SOMETHING ELSE U ARE CRAY-ZAY!</li>
    <li> Still up there as one of the better personal groomers.  Decent battery life, shower-proof and easy to clean (if needed.)  Easy to use and cleanly designed, it gets the job done...what else could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd shaver because my first one broke where the twist off head attaches. Now this 2nd has broken in the same place as well after only 2 months of owning it. It works GREAT for body shaving, but now I have to have it all duct taped up and I can&#x27;t remove the head anymore for cleaning purposes. Just needs to be built a tougher.</li>
    <li> Just replaced my BG2020 trimmer and am very impressed.  The motor seems more powerful and the fit and finish of this trimmer seems to be much higher quality as well.  Took half the time to trim with this trimmer and the clipper attachment works great.</li>
    <li> after so many years ,nothing else comes close to this one.</li>
    <li> this is the best thing that was ever invented its a guy thing and thanks</li>
    <li> Works great on all body hair. Works much better then my older model that i had to replace due to the on/off button getting stuck</li>
    <li> Just got mine after reading endless reviews!  And this thing is the best groomer, ever.  Easy to use, great attachments.  Used it for a quick trim, can&#x27;t wait to get things really smooth. Thanks Amazon and Norelco!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco BG2030 over a month ago and while I am satisfied, I do have some minor complaints.  Pros-  1.Very affordable.  2. I am totally shocked at how easy to use this thing is. Even while using it in the shower I had no trouble holding on to it because the grip is very good.  3. I Like the different attachments. They each serve a very good purpose and I find myself using all of them.  Cons-  1. Removing attachments can sometimes be a pain. They seem to not want to come off. However, this could easily be user error or specific to my purchase as I haven&#x27;t seen any similar complaints.  2. Charging cord was just a little short for me. Found it difficult to find a place to plug it in.  3. During my first use the trimmer actually cut my skin. I have no clue why or how. It was a very small cut that barely broke the skin but bled like crazy. It hasn&#x27;t happened since and I&#x27;ve used it tons. User error or bad luck, but it still happened.  Overall I was very satisfied and would gladly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable personal grooming option.</li>
    <li> It says what it will do without the fear of being injured.  I say this because my friends have told me horror stories of using trimmers anywhere on the body and it catching skin.    I got the grooming system in the mail yesterday and tried it out (after another item I got in the mail totally failed) and I must say that this made my day much better.    The regular foil got as close as I could with a regular razer (my fusion power) and I decided to try the attachments and they worked great and I love the 5 settings per attachment.    Only down fall is, as mentioned by another customer, that to use the trimmer attachments you must change the main head from the foil to another attachment.  If you plan on using it in the shower you have to carry all the heads with out and it does not come with a carrying case or anything, which may also cause a problem when you travel.    Despite that one downside it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I rely on user reviews so I&#x27;ll do my best to make this as useful as possible.  First I&#x27;ll talk about the experience with Amazon. The delivery of the product was on time and with the free super saver shipping it was a bargain. The packaging itself wasn&#x27;t annoying to open and the product was well packed so it wasn&#x27;t damaged at all.  Now as for the body groomer the directions are useful so I advise reading them before using the groomer itself since it indicates how the groomer and it&#x27;s parts are stored on the dock.  I have used both shaving heads and they are useful and do not cause any snagging or pain at all. It shaves very neatly and quickly to the point I was surprised. The charge time of the unit is very decent and doesn&#x27;t need constant charging. The construction of the groomer is pretty sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy, I didn&#x27;t drop it so far so I don&#x27;t have proof, it just feels sturdy. The grip on the groomer is very good and prevents it from being dropped all the time, which was a problem I have with most shavers/groomers. I haven&#x27;t tried the groomer wet or in the shower so I can&#x27;t give any feedback on that.</li>
    <li> Maybe my expectations were faulty, but product doesn&#x27;t perform up to what I had foreseen. Even after using the shaving attachment there is still a bit of stubble. It has been a month and this problem has not gotten better; I have tried dry, wet, wet with soap, wet with shaving cream. For trimming hair it works great and I am happy enough that I will probably not return under the 45 day return period, but I am not fully pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Works really well, making the second notch from the end the same size as the others was a huge improvement over the old model, that notch on the old model caused me some very, very nasty nicks in a place I don&#x27;t need nicked.  After two years still working strong.&lt;br /&gt;Suggested improvement would be to make the stand smaller or provide a switch cover for travel, great that the stand holds everything, just not great for travel, have arrived more than once with a discharged battery and don&#x27;t normally bring the charger due to size.  For home use really like it, far better than a razor.</li>
    <li> This worked great for a couple of years for my son.  It was easy to use and he liked it.  It was completely destroyed after two years, but I am sure he abused it.  He did tell me that he liked it and was satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I liked very much my new bodygrooming system. Phillips is a very good brand and I reccomended to another customers for their good quality.</li>
    <li> The charger decided not to work one day, and that was it for the process. This happen within a year, so invest in a better bodygrooming shaver!</li>
    <li> I had the old model of this trimmer, the BG2020, and that worked pretty good. The on/off button on my old got jammed so I had to trash it and get this one. This new one is a big improvement in features, comfort and usability over the last one. The two trimming heads are great for any amount or size of hair and everything stores in the base which is a great space saver. The only reason I have this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. You do get more features with this one, but the old one was a bargain value.</li>
    <li> I also own the preceding model of this series. I want to specify that this new product is an amazing improvement over the past model. I am very hairy (in my legs) and it was extremely easy to shorten body hair. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is perfect for trimming hair anywhere on your body.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This upgraded version is sturdier and has a few more bells and whistles than the lower end version (one of which I have killed off already- stuck on/off button), but you pay for that with the higher price.  It has a few extra accessories as well (which were sort of useless for me, but maybe not for you).  But the trimmer, stand and charging plug all seem to be better engineered and definite Pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: higher price.</li>
    <li> Short and sweet, it&#x27;s 2009 and the yrs. of \\&quot;Furry chest/special parts\\&quot; are long gone. The first model of Norelco&#x27;s body groomer was \\&quot;nice\\&quot; this one is great. Everything from the style/shape to the actual feel of the bodies motor is awesome. If your looking to shed those old \\&quot;traditions\\&quot; of to be a male one must be hairy, than at the current moment this is the best way to go. To date i havent found a more convenient and best way to do away with that much un-needed chest/body hair than this product. The first model lasted me over 2yrs so im sure the quality of product is still there with this one. Bottomline, your girlfriend/wife will appreciate it men. Time to let go of the past, its year 2009 and this product is awesome!</li>
    <li> Good shaver, wish there was trimmer comb that was even shorter.  Overall good shaver, would buy again.</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked well but the battery really started to take a dive after 2 years.  You&#x27;d go to pick it up to use it and it would be dead.  It just wouldn&#x27;t hold much of a charge between uses. Now it&#x27;s to the point where it will barely hold a charge.  It lasts for about 30 seconds and dies.</li>
    <li> Works fine. But too expensive and there are cheaper ones out there to do the same job. and good quality.</li>
    <li> i love it, saw a lot of difference on this one. the old version didnt work for me, but this one totally left me smooth. :D</li>
    <li> I owned the previous model as well, and I prefer the new BG2030. The BG2030 has an additional advantage in that its shortest trimmer setting is even closer than the shortest trim attachment on the old model. Perfect for those who want a close trim. Beyond that, may it suffice to say I agree with all the positive reviews. The head is a bit smaller than its predecessor, but the slightly smaller size helps it sail over the countours of one&#x27;s chest much easier. This is a good trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One technical suggestion for owners: The instructions suggest letting the BG2030 run out of power before charging it (and to turn the charging base station off until needed). But the base station doesn&#x27;t have an on/off button. So to accommodate their advice, and to avoid the hassle of plugging and unplugging the charging base, I went to the hardware store and for a couple bucks got an on/off switch that plugs into the outlet. (It goes between the outlet and the plug, and has an on/off button on it.) In this way I keep the base station without power until needed.</li>
    <li> No more nicks, cuts and going over the same area again and again. This trimmer/shaver performs incredibly well on every part of the body.    The only issue I discovered was that it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well on wet skin, but the dry performance is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I usually wait for few months before I write off a positive review for a product and this one is no different. I really like BG2030 because it&#x27;s easy to use and does what it&#x27;s made to. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy, good quality and long Battery life. very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this item once since purchasing it, but I have to say I&#x27;m impressed overall with its performance. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to: allows me to groom those sensitive areas quickly without having to worry about possible nicks or hair pulls. Easily it the best method I come across so far. Its light weight, shape, plus the fact that it stays cool make it very easy to manipulate while using (especially compared to the old electric hair clippers I was using before I bought the BG2030. The included heads and adjustable guards give you plenty of options for cutting to different lengths as well.    My only complaints: the base is required to charge the unit. That&#x27;s another piece I need to worry about carrying when traveling. I would have preferred it if I had the option (as I do on my Panasonic shaver) to plug the BG2030 directly into the wall outlet without the base. It would have been nice if they had included a case or pouch as well, but I guess I could find something suitable online.</li>
    <li> it does the job and there is now pinching, cutting or burning.. very nice and worth the money</li>
    <li> Excellent product in comparison to my last Phillips Bodygroom TT2021/30 that simply doesnt work , clogging every 4 inches with hair to clean..was terrible. This new body groomer works ok..excellent</li>
    <li> This is a vast improvement over the old model.  The first iteration had very brittle combs which broke easily (and soon did); while they were functioning, they sometimes proved diffcult to remove, and hairs one intended only to trim had a tendency to get caught in the shaving foil and ripped out.  This new model solves that problem by making the foil and combs part of self-contained units which remove completely from the top of the unit with ease.  The new units also allow for more gradations of hair length, which allows you to sculpt the hair to the look and feel that you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found no better method than this trimmer for quickly and painlessly trimming down body hair to a presentable, comfortable level for both appearance, and comfort when exercising.  If you have any spots from which you would like to completely remove hair, you will probably want to explore a method like waxing, which will last longer; however, even then you will need to trim the hair down first, which this trimmer will help you do quickly and comfortably.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but i have shaved with a normal razor before so i have something to compare it to...the BG2030 does about the same job my normal razor did...except for the fact that the leading and trailing trimmers on the shaving head grab and CUT any loose skin such as down in the groin area...which happened to me and i was cut twice...not fun at all! the trimmers work ok but i would recommend using scissors if you have a lot of hair as it just makes the process easier. A useful product...but not the best...i wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it if you already have a razor just use a different blade than the one you use for your face and it produces the same results</li>
    <li> This razor (BG2030) is far better than the BG2020 because the blade does not fall out.  The only thing holding the blade in on my BG2020 is gravity.  The BG2030 is excellent for avoiding nicks on the neck.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I get terrible razor burn on my thighs when I shave. First off, the wide area trimmer has very spaced blades so going across sensitive areas for that pre-shave trim tends to pinch sometimes. It takes multiple passes for the trimmer to really do its job. The attachments are pretty pointless, I don&#x27;t know where on your body your hair would be so long that you need it as the trimmer leaves it at a buzzed length already. Maybe Chewbacca would find it useful? Anyways. The shaver foil was somewhat of a disappointment. It has two pulsating blades, one on top and one on bottom. The one on the top will almost never be used. As you shave, you have to tilt the thing at an awkward angle so that the bottom blades can trim the hairs before they get to the foil, and at this angle it pulls the hairs and pinches. Really hurts. The foil itself, even after the necessary multiple passes, leaves a scruff that is uncomfortable. Unfortunately, the size of the shaver foil attachment works horribly against the purpose of this shaver. A lot of men, myself included, are going to use this to shave their private area. It doesn&#x27;t work very well down there. The delicate area between your privates and your leg is impossible for this thing to get down into, and if you push it in the blades on top and bottom pinch your sensitive skin like crazy. Your skin sometimes turns red and irritated after using this shaver. I really don&#x27;t see a purpose for this to be waterproof because it doesn&#x27;t do its job at all in the shower. Once the skin turns wet and soft, the shaver just pushes them over and runs right past them. Tried to use it twice in the shower, and had to get out and dry off both times so my hair would stand up before I could use it and then get back in afterwards to wash the hair off. Using it with wet hair will also jam up the trimmers around the foil as wet hair will cake into the space underneath of it and hair can no longer pass into the blades to be cut.     Overall, itdoes what it says, but no better than a traditional set of peanut clippers that you can but for ten bucks at Walmart. The only difference is the peanut clippers will hit more faster, and ultimately make it an easier experience. An ok product, but I really regret spending $45+shipping on it.</li>
    <li> So my main concern was finding something I could use on my kibbles and bits... \\&quot;down south\\&quot;.  As background, I&#x27;ve been holding on to an old electric shaver that Panasonic made 10 years ago because its trimmer was the ONLY thing I&#x27;d found that didn&#x27;t cut the &#x27;goose&#x27; skin down on the beanbag...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY here is something that is totally beanbag friendly.  I also used it on my chest, and while it takes a few passes and I have to hold it sort of &#x27;inverted&#x27; for the first pass, it does a solid job with minimal irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the MAIN thing I am impressed with is the no pinching, no cutting action down where nature really didn&#x27;t want you getting cut.  Five stars for finally giving me an answer that works as it should.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he was very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I loved the base / charger. It is very sweet that you can store all the small pieces inside it. Very cool design.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a place to store the charging chord, though.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the battery. It holds well, but it takes too long to recharge it - eight hours. At some other occasion, I gave my husband a face shaver (different brand) that takes only one hour to full charge, and also can have an \\&quot;emmergecy charge\\&quot; in five minutes, wich is enough for one shave. I don&#x27;t get why all the battery-powered suplies don&#x27;t use this kind of quick-charging batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it works well and my husband is pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attention: not to be used on face or head.</li>
    <li> in few words, more than great, i&#x27;ve tried many products, never felt safer with any of them but this one, simply a great buy.</li>
    <li> I will agree with most other opinions. The Philips Norelco BG2030 works great and does what it claims it will do and it does it for a reasonable price.  the one major problem that i have had is that where the interchangeable head locks into place is not very sturdy.  I am no about to possibly purchase my 3rd shaver since the 1st 2 have broken at this area.  I love this unit enough I am still considering purchasing another one even  with this issue.  So be forewarned about this problem and be very careful and you should have a great shaver to handle all it claims to be.</li>
    <li> The trimmer does the job globally.  I would have like a wider one (comparable in size to a regular trimmer) so that it would take less time to trim the chest for example.</li>
    <li> I have mixed reviews on this product.  I shave with an electric shaver all the time.  This one kinda irritates my skin more, really pulls on the hair, its pretty worthless in the shower.  The hair connection pieces are pretty good though, easy to set &amp; remove.  Really easy to clean.  Last awhile when fully charged.  Its okay but not brilliant.</li>
    <li> My junk is happy happy :)</li>
    <li> Really works well and DURABLE!!! I bought this in September of 2012 and it&#x27;s still going strong. Dropped it MANY times in the shower but it&#x27;s still running just as well. And in case you&#x27;re curious, it works well for guys for trimming up the areas &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great machine. It&#x27;s high powered and grooms at a fast pace. I also like how all the attachments fit in the slide out compartment build into the unit. I would say the only thing it is missing is the nose trimmer attachment. Nonetheless you can still manage trimming your nose hairs with the included attachments. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S A BIG UPGRADE FROM THE 2020 MODEL, BUT IT&#x27;S STILL NOT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ME, MEANING, A BLADE STILL CUTS IT SMOOTH AND CLOSER, SO ON A SCALE OF 1-10 WITH 10 BEING TOPS, I&#x27;D GIVE IT A 8!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at Amazon.com, and as usual the item arrived earlier than the stated delivery date. Upon opening the package, and charging the product as instructed, I was really pleased to see the ease with which the attachments interchanged. Having used the product on my particularely hairy chest, I will say that the product has exceeded my high expectations. Sturdy, well contoured for my not too large hands, and easy to clean, Phillips has desiged a real winner here. Happy to own this profduct so far.</li>
    <li> I have major hair growth and this works great everywhere.    The adjustable guards are great so you don&#x27;t have to store a ton of those things. The charging station also serves as a great storage area for the accessories.    Charge lasts for ever.    Love this thing.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Phillips Nornelco personal groomer (below the neck) and I am very pleased with it. It is extremely easy to use and I feel clean and groomed. Next time I will not cut so close LOL. I really do love it and love the feel.</li>
    <li> All I wanted is a trimmer that would work and don&#x27;t give me trouble. I have been using it since 10 months now. Its water proof and serves the basic purposes. I will surely recommend it if you want a trimmer with no extra features that serves its purpose</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last long (maybe a year), and was hard to hold sometimes.</li>
    <li> This electric razor absolutely destroyed my nut bag! Half way through my hands were shaking and sweat was dripping off my balls due to the fact I was so afraid of making myself bleed again. The directions say to have the foil against the skin- ZAP!!!- an electric shock goes through my body and bloods starts dripping. So I put on the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; attachment- ZAP!!!- more blood, this time worse. After about the fourth or fifth time I drew crimson, my junk looked like Edward Scissor hands and Freddie Kruger doubled-down and gave me a cheap behind the drugstore handjob. I felt like I was once again playing the childhood game of Operation, as I tried to maintain a steady hand not to illuminate the patient&#x27;s nose- which looks eerily like the blood spots around my coin purse. Once I learned through the school of hard knocks, I put on the guard attachment that controls the hair length. This works a lot better- but my nuts aren&#x27;t shiny bald like I thought they would be. If I put the attachment on from the very beginning my twins feel like a couple of kiwis, which is ok, I guess. I wish the advertisements and/or directions were a little more clear, but most of all I hope my scars heal.</li>
    <li> I just bought this shaver and I have found out it does not work very good at all! The big razor blades work but the foil part of the shaver is absolutely pathetic.. I would not get it..</li>
    <li> The shaver works well as a hair trimmer. The curved shape takes some getting used to compared to my old straight beard trimmer. Battery life is good and cuts coarse beard hair easily.</li>
    <li> This is not a product that build to last very long, the battery inside died merely after 4 charges and won&#x27;t hold power anymore. I crack the thing open and found two cheap made in china Ni-mh rechargeable batteries that are un-replaceable. I happen to own and like the Philips 1290x shaver and the 9332 DiamondClean toothbrush and this grooming kit feels like some cheap OEM product with a Philips brand name on it. I wish they could put a bit more design effort on the shaver itself that than the fancy stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[UPDATE ]I just received my Braun cruzer Body shaver I ordered, MUCH MUCH better design and a lot more powerful and has a cordless charging system just like the Soniccare.</li>
    <li> I purchased the BG2030 to replace my previous BodyGroomer that had died - the button no longer &#x27;clicked&#x27; the machine on - based on previous reviews. When I received the machine I was impressed by how far Philips has evolved the BodyGroomer, and in contrast to other reviewers found the new trimming head and combs to be a welcome change. Not only are the combs more easily adjustable than the previous model and thus more accurate, but with one for &#x27;sensitive&#x27; areas and the other for everything else it aides in maintaining high hygiene of the attachments. The only minor difficulty I had was with the charge light that did not function on my unit which Philips has agreed to replace - this did not affect the operation of the machine, but the CSR felt returning it was the appropriate way to handle the issue.     Overall I would recommend the BG2030 for any &#x27;man-scaping&#x27; that you need to do, only cautioning that if you need a truly bare result that you will have to use an additional razor to achieve the desired result. If well kept with a little stubble is all you are looking for then this machine will do the job and then some.</li>
    <li> I have tried many personal shavers.  This is actually better than the one I originally liked and was trying to replace.  Most shavers of their type nick or cause a lot of damage once you approach more sensitive skin.  Razor blades I have found can cause horrific rashes, so there wasn&#x27;t really another option for me until now.      This one is the safest personal shavers I have ever used.  It has really nice clipper style attachments with adjustable guides and a small \\&quot;standard\\&quot; electric shaver for smoothing out areas.  The standard shaver head also has long hair trimmers that work great.  Between the clippers and shaver you can do anything from trimming beards, to side burns, to underarms, and of course your bikini area.  The unit is attractive and sturdy, charges quickly, and can be used cordless for weeks before charging again.</li>
    <li> High quality design that works. Great ergonomics, good battery life, and comes with enough attachments. The one gripe I do have is that the charging base is a little on the large side. The blades do the job and cut through hair the first time. Great product. I would recommend this to anyone who needs todo a little man-scaping.</li>
    <li> it worked fine. but it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and he absolutely loves it. Works wet or dry, even on sensitive areas without catching skin. I think the problems other reviewers had was due to holding the blade at the wrong angle, keeping it parallel to the skin is instruction right from the box. No need to trim before using the closer blade, it doesn&#x27;t take hair right down to the skin but it&#x27;s pretty close. He described it as a \\&quot;fuzzy chainsaw for my junk.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this product to avoid cutting myself. I cut myself less with a razor! Let&#x27;s just say the boys looked a bit more like a  shaggy dog.</li>
    <li> If you want to have a smooth shaved look and have dark coarse hair like me, this is the not the tool for the job. It requires many passes over the same area, and then still doesn&#x27;t leave it close to as smooth as a regular razor. Plus, there&#x27;s always patches of hair it misses so you end up with little stubbles and skin that will make you want to go back to shaving with a razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is good though if you&#x27;re just using it for trimming.</li>
    <li> It can probably work for 10 minutes and the battery drains out in probably a week.  It has been a problem since the day I bought it, and it&#x27;s worse over time. It is OK but probably does not worth $50.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is a very hairy man and his old BG2030 is running out on him so I&#x27;m getting him another one for Christmas :)</li>
    <li> Works great.  Battery life is excellent.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to see that Norelco created this product. It is safe and convenient to use pretty much anywhere on the body (including private parts). I am not aware of any other product like this on the market, and certainly not one as nicely executed as this. You can even buy replacement shaving heads. Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t work after 4 months but Philips gave me a replacement (newer model) for the price of shipping (FEDEX returns only). Do not buy this model though if you value your money. Batteries are cheap nickel cadmium and it won&#x27;t recharge. BUY SOMETHING ELSE.</li>
    <li> I owned this shaver for several years and it finally died on me, so I purchased this &#x27;new and improved&#x27; version. I am not so impressed: I have had this about a year and the plastic mechanism that holds the &#x27;head&#x27; in place has broken. It still works to a small degree, but I am rather disappointed.  It works wet or dry, and that&#x27;s a big selling point for me, but I do not think I will be buying this particular unit again.</li>
    <li> This works fine for trimming body hair when you have to go cordless.  I use it outside on my chest and back a couple of times per year.  I have a better corded trimmer, but don&#x27;t feel like pulling out the extension cord to trim my natural sweater in the back yard.  I prefer my Wahl corded for my beard grooming.  This has a habit of pulling beard hair.</li>
    <li> I use this almost every month and the shave is very close in the sensitive regions. Highly recommended product for those who want to remain well groomed in the &#x27;other&#x27; regions.</li>
    <li> Great razor with lots of features and add-ons.  Battery life could be a little better but overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Light and streamlined. Does its job. I have been a customer of Philips Norelco products for several years and never regret purchasing anything they sell.</li>
    <li> Works great. No problems after much use.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. Goatee, eyebrows.. does it all. Easy to use and all the attachments are useful.</li>
    <li> I like this body groomer. Very easy to use, easy to clean with 2 nice attachments that come on easily and work well for their purpose. Nice handy charger too with a back storage unit to hold everything together. Philips Norelco has always had quality shavers, this one is not an exception.</li>
    <li> Long battery life, doesn&#x27;t pull hair after using every other day for a year to keep my beard trimmed. I leave it on the shower shelf and havent had a single problem</li>
    <li> in those sensitive and tight areas, it really works well without cutting or hurting. Doesn&#x27;t work so well as a wet shaver in the shower though ... best when used dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift.  It has been very reliable, no problems with it.  I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this item back in 2010 and it was only $48 at that time. I don&#x27;t know why the price has increased so much! It is not an option anymore with this price. Oops, I&#x27;ve found the same produce at Walmart and it is only $39.97.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> mine easily broke when I dropped it - before that, not very impressed with its performance either - good ol&#x27; small electric clippers seem better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for over three years, and the high-performance trimmer finally died.  :-/  And I can&#x27;t find replacements.  :-(  But, it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt; - waterproof.&lt;br /&gt; - two trimmer combs, each with 5 heights, for 10 heights total.&lt;br /&gt; - quickly trimmed my beard, armpit, and groin hair.&lt;br /&gt; - slim compared to the other Bodygrooms; nicer appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I&#x27;ll need to find another trimmer.</li>
    <li> This model is much improved over the previous one, which I just tossed out after receiving this one.  To start, the older model never cut as well, and the attatchments were a constant annoyance.  They had little tabs on the edges which were used to keep them in place, but over time, the tabs wore off, causing the attatchments to just fall off constantly.  Moreover, with more frequent use, the power button would become jammed, causing the unit to turn on, but you couldn&#x27;t turn it off! Very aggravating.      This new one is hands down what a proper trimmer should be.  It is everything the older model should have been and more.  The build quality looks a lot sturdier, the attatcments well thought out, and my favorite -- you can store all the attatcments in the unit itself, so you always have everthying at hand.  Most importantly, however, is this unit&#x27;s ability to completely hack through any patch of hair you may put in it&#x27;s path.  The attachments have many settings, so be sure to not make the same mistake I made when starting out.  Start at the biggest attatchment and work your way to a shorter lengths.  The attatchments can be a bit tricky to learn at first.      If you hated the first one (blue model) like I did, do yourself a favor and spend a bit more and buy this one.  You won&#x27;t be dissappointed.</li>
    <li> this shaver does shave and trim faily well but the battery life is terrible. i bought norelco and paid the price for this instead of a cheaper one thinking it wouldn&#x27;t have such a fault, but it does. would not buy again.</li>
    <li> The sideburn trimmer broke because I didn&#x27;t know how to use it and probably busted it in confusion. Everything else is good though. The holster is pretty bulky and feels really light and weak. I&#x27;ll probably rather invest in a higher performance model when I need to replace this, but this one is good for what it is.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t.  Stay groomed.  The groomer itself is nice, the rubber is good, etc.  I hate the charging doc and storage for the accessories.  Could be thought out better.</li>
    <li> Battery dying very fast even afterccharge!</li>
    <li> Dropped it several times on ceramic tub and still works like new! I get cleaned up nicely in the groin area! Do not pay $140 for it though... I got it for around half of that!</li>
    <li> This works like a charm and holds a charge a long time. Not cheesey, Made of good quality.  Works like it is suppose to.</li>
    <li> will shave anything you put it on.  great trimmer and more durable than the drug store variety.&lt;br /&gt;easy to handle and shaving head  combs work great.&lt;br /&gt; would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Still use this after 6 years. Works great, highly recommend</li>
