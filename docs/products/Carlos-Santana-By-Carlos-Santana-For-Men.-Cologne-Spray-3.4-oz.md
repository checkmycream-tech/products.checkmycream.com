      <li>Arrived quickly and the price was the lowest on the internet!</li>
      <li>Will continue to use this product till it is no longer available.</li>
      <li>I purchase this cologne because a few years ago it was the best scent to women.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a shame that its no longer available in stores.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this cologne and while it is light, that is my preference as so many people are scent sensitive</li>

      <li>The ingredients seemed right on the money for his taste.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to find this at such a low price.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I love this cologne.  My husband wore it for over a year... that is until my teenage son swiped it from him!  I&#x27;m happy to find this at such a low price.  I&#x27;m buying some for my son for Christmas.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores... So glad Amazon has it!</li>
    <li> this is my third bottle of Santana in the past 5 years...everyone always asks me what I&#x27;m wearing - they all agree it is a wonderful cologne - especially the women!!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne spray in the 3.4 oz size for my husband 3 years ago.  He&#x27;s still using it up - he uses this cologne every day, 365 days a year - so this bottle is going to last you quite a long time.  My husband likes this Carlos Santana cologne, and I flippin&#x27; love it on him.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this.  I can&#x27;t tell you much about fragrance notes, but I can tell you that I still love it after smelling it on my hubby every day for 3 years.</li>
    <li> I bought for my teenage son. He loves it and so do I. Not to over powering, and last along time.  He pours cologne on like water so for the price and fluid ounces its a great buy.Packaging and bottle are also appealing.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I personally like this Cologne and have purchased several bottles over time, it&#x27;s not too sweet and not too fruity or pungent. It&#x27;s inexpensive enough to be used as a daily cologne so you can save the really good stuff for special occasions.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find locally?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works...pretty good stuff...</li>
    <li> Carlos Santanna is amazing! Retail stores stopped selling it some years back. I was so happy to find it online and of course it smells amazing! I love it. It will be my favorite for life!!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004I6H1Z4 Carlos Santana Carlos Santana 3.4 oz Fine Cologne Spray For Men]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like bold fresh smell of this cologne stays with you thru out day</li>
    <li> I have worn lots of colognes in my life.......  I have NEVER gotten as many comments (or as often) back from any one on how good I smell except for this one!!!  Truly amazing how this fragrance works for me.  I hope other guys don&#x27;t buy it ........  saves the compliments for me.  :-)</li>
    <li> I have used this now for over a year and women compliment all the time. I was about to run out and was pleased to find it was available from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne and had become difficult to find!!! I was thrilled when I received an even&lt;br /&gt;Larger size bottle for less money than I used to pay in the stores when I could find it!!! He was thrilled on Christmas morning when he opened it!!!</li>
    <li> This product took about 3 weeks to get to me.  After it shipped, I noted that it didn&#x27;t start it&#x27;s journey.  After contacting the seller, they stated that it broke and the USPS returned it.  They said it would ship again in 2 days.  Well, they were true to their word and I got it the next week!  Great product, get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I purchased a lot of colognes all at once on Amazon,&lt;br /&gt; so I have not used this product much, but it seems nice.&lt;br /&gt; Obviously it will not be as glamorous or have the long&lt;br /&gt;lasting smell as a really expensive cologne, but for the&lt;br /&gt; price this is still a dynamite deal!!!!</li>
    <li> Delicious&lt;br /&gt;You smell so good&lt;br /&gt;You smell yummy&lt;br /&gt;What are you wearing?&lt;br /&gt;etc.. etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost everyday I hear these for the past 10 years or so. I say Carlos Santana and no one has ever heard of it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price doesn&#x27;t break the bank and the scent definitely is mild but present. I am a big fan.</li>
    <li> I have used many different colognes in my life. THIS cologne is the BEST!!! The scent is a but sweet but it is a very light scent. It&#x27;s the perfect cologne for going out at night with my wife, but I also wear it to work and have gotten many compliments from men and women alike. One reviewer said it wasn&#x27;t a masculine cologne, and I guess he&#x27;s right. However the scent is a one of a kind scent and well worth the purchase. Add to that the price on Amazon. I ended up buying 2 bottles since the price was so low. At the local mall I would&#x27;ve paid more for one bottle than I did for two bottles on Amazon. If you&#x27;re looking for a one of a kind scent that is perfect for any occasion at a great value then this is the cologne you want.</li>
    <li> Hard to find but worth the search. This fragrance has an alluring scent which I like.</li>
    <li> Smells so good on a handsome bald guy ;-) Delivered on time and so easy.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells like heaven on earth. i love it! I&#x27;m not sure what the ingredients are but it&#x27;s a good mix. i wish i knew what to compare it too as far as smells go,but I don&#x27;t. i say give it a try,you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This cologne was just as good as i remember it. It smelled like the real thing. It has a spicy sweet scent that is perfect for a man.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my brother who loves it and so does his wife.  He will probably order again for himself.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this cologne when it first hit the market a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;It is my favorite fragrance.  Fresh and clean smelling.  When a lady hugs me she&lt;br /&gt;always compliments fragrance and asks what it is..........</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on this.  It isn&#x27;t at all feminine like a lot of men&#x27;s fragrances .  I don&#x27;t know about all the scents that the description says it has but the combination is a good one according the the compliments I get.</li>
    <li> Awesomeness in a spray bottle!!! I love this product!!! Will continue to use this product till it is no longer available.</li>
    <li> I love it,  I have been using it for about 7 years.  I have had ladies walk up to me and grab my shirt, sniff, asking me what it is.  I will tell you it dont smell the same on everyone.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne I&#x27;ve owned since roughly 2005.  I often refer to the scent as &amp;#34;man cherry&amp;#34;.  Not over powering like some other scents, subtle but noticeable when someone is close.</li>
    <li> Love it! I had been looking for this cologne for a while. The price was great.  I recommend this company to anyone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a warm and woodsy scent, a big hit with the husband.  Love the packaging and the large bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I always wanted to smell like a rich Mexican and now I do . Smells good .&lt;br /&gt;Comments abound praising my taste in fragrance</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new cologne, and so do I!!</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of this product and the potency is less that what I am used to, I bought them realizing the boxes were open but they don&#x27;t seem right. I love the fragrance, and maybe it was a bad batch.</li>
    <li> I have been using Carlos Santana for quite a while now and I do receive a lot of compliments on it. It is kind of hard to find you can&#x27;t buy in a store you have to order it online that not being a problem. I love the smell of it so much.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. We both liked the scent. It is a high quality cologne at a great price. Would recommend to all ages!</li>
    <li> I adore this scent! I get compliments all the time when I wear it. It blends well with my own natural musk.  It&#x27;s a shame that its no longer available in stores. Its has a distinct very masculine, woodsy scent. Its scent is in the realm close to my other favorite cologne, Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession.</li>
    <li> A great product which really lasts through the day and makes me feel special, it has worked for me, keep it coming guys and thank you Carlos, Basil</li>
    <li> Really like the smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos Santana By Carlos Santana For Men. Cologne Spray 3.4 oz  gave it to my son.</li>
    <li> Very week sent that doesn&#x27;t have any staying power. This is one that is over priced for what you get.</li>
    <li> Got it for my teen son. i smells great. He loves it. He even gets complements on how nice he smells when he wears it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked all over for the cologne, now I know.Thanks</li>
    <li> There were a lot of good reviews so I took a chance on the cologne due to the low price, but it was too sweet for my liking and I just didn&#x27;t care for it. Maybe it&#x27;s just not for me. I still use it from time to time due to the fact that I already bought it and it&#x27;s usable, but I just don&#x27;t feel content that it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim for my husband. He loves Santanas music and I thought he might like to try his colonge as well.The ingredients seemed right on the money for his taste. He is in love! It smells hippy,classy,earthy yet still complex.Masculine but a little sweet. The color and bottle are cool. Will purchase again.Also 10% goes toward his childrens charity!</li>
    <li> The product was as described, new in a box.  The seller sent good communication throughout the sale and the product shipped right away.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> For the price, I like this cologne.  The closest comparison I can think of Thalium.  A little too sweet smelling at first but after a few minutes it smells pretty good.  Not very masculine so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for, this might not be the cologne for you.  But it does smell good, ladies will like it, and is well worth the price of under $20.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance on hubby</li>
    <li> Some good Cologne! If you&#x27;re married, stay away from this cologne! It will attract the ladies! You&#x27;ve been warned</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and the price was the lowest on the internet! It&#x27;s a great smell and Carlos Santana is involved!</li>
    <li> like caravan saria [SP]</li>
    <li> This is one of the purchases on Amazon Prime that I just wonder how in the world they make any money.  How I was able to get a large size prime time cologne for less than $20 shipped to me in 2 days is amazing.  I really enjoy this cologne and while it is light, that is my preference as so many people are scent sensitive and this probably is less challenging.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Santana for a few years and always get compliments from the women.  It has a nice musky smell.</li>
    <li> Carlos Santana cologne for men is a great cologne! I really like it because it has a very rare scent but still very nice smelling. There are several other great colognes out there but they seem to have very similar elements that make up their scents, Carlos Santana has taken some rare and what I would like to call almost spicy sweet smelling elements and created what I have found to be a rare scent in the Mens Cologne world. Definitely catches her attention if that what your trying to do. :~)</li>
    <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve come across,It works all day.! Tried others and they disappear in a few hrs. Amazon is the best place and the cheapest in town on this.</li>
    <li> the best but can not find anymore???</li>
    <li> I bought the product and it smells great. The only problem was the bottle itself. The cap is real loose. It wont stay on the bottle. Also it is like somebody sprayed it before they shipped it to me cause the first time I took it out of the bottle to give it a spray I didnt have to pump it to get it to spray. It sprayed on the first shot. It would have been no big deal but I bought it for a gift and now the person is going to think that I sprayed it before giving it to them or they might think I am regifting a gift.</li>
    <li> The price, the quality and speed of delivery were great. A little goes a long way and my husband likes that I can&#x27;t stay away from him.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend and he loves it and so do I. This is definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Just like Carlos this scent is very unique. I think for the price it&#x27;s worth it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have a long hang time,</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and gets compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this cologne as we all know C. S. is a excellent musician and I must say his cologne is just as Excellent as his music. This fragrance is clean and fresh with just a hint of masculine musk..very lightly added to the mix. Youll remember this fragrance for some time to come..Its a keeper./</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me long ago and it&#x27;s just become &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; scent.  It&#x27;s a great spicy formula that I honestly can&#x27;t smell when I&#x27;m wearing it but everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> One of the very few scents I can wear! Very nice and I get lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> took a shot on this since I hadn&#x27;t even heard about it, I&#x27;m a bit of a cologne whore and I rarely chime in but damn I&#x27;ve gotta say gentlemen if you want to stand out and make the lady&#x27;s drool&lt;br /&gt;this cologne has got to be in your arsenal, way mad props to CS if he&#x27;s input more then just his name on the box &amp; bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to buy a back up for myself and some for Xmas gifts. easily one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve stumbled across</li>
    <li> For the price you cant beat it and it smells great !</li>
    <li> I do like the way it does smell,  but I am not impress, I guess that&#x27;s why only 4 stars, although few people did like it on me, but for my taste it is just  a like.</li>
    <li> It came on time and solved my problem of what to get my brother in law, he really like this.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne after reading all the great reviews, but this cologne just didn&#x27;t smell like I thought it would and it didn&#x27;t last at all.  It&#x27;s not a bad cologne, just not for me.</li>
    <li> My brothers favorite! Can&#x27;t find it in any stores so I was thrilled to find it here. He won&#x27;t wear any other so my gift was a hit!</li>
    <li> Great product for me...is becoming a bit difficult to find..thankful to find it on amazon..please do not discontinue...have been using this product for many years..</li>
    <li> I purchase this cologne because a few years ago it was the best scent to women. when I purchased it recently online it smelled watered down compared to the original bottle I purchased at the department store.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the price online and would recommend smelling the colognes in a store before ordering online</li>
    <li> WASN&#x27;T SURE WHAT TO EXPECT BUT HAVE BOOTS FROM C. SANTANA AND DECEIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE. WAS FOR HUSBAND BIRTHDAY AND HE LOVES IT, I ALSO!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I get at least one positive comment from a lady every time I wear this. It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
