      <li>Now that I&#x27;ve added Terax Crema to the equation, my hair has been better than ever.   </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Then I put a ton more in...</li>
      <li>this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It was just ok</li>
      <li>My hair is more manageable, and so I now wear my hair wavy.  </li>
      <li>My daughter and I both have fine hair and hers tangles very easily.</li>
      <li>I am always a big Moroccanoil hair product user but decided to try something new when I saw the awesome price and great reviews for Terax on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have tried every kind of conditioner over the years, including the higher priced brands (Bumble and Bumble, Kerastase)</li>
      <li>It is purely just good stuff, no extra water to help stretch it out, just good stuff.</li>
      <li>It smells great, gives amazing shine, and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
      <li>Coconut oil is much more economical too.</li>
      <li>i used this a while ago after i saw my sisters hair (so smooth and glossy.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great, especially in the summer when sun, sea water and pool water get my hair all damaged.  </li>
      <li>Crema is a professional salon quality product that transformed  my hair from the scarecrow to the good witch of the north.</li>
      <li>It is a great product, doesn&#x27;t react with my skin as many other conditioners do.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I both have long hair, and Terax does a great job of detailing our hair in the shower so that we&#x27;re not pulling it out at the roots when brushing or styling.</li>
      <li>it has a lovely smell, cute/retro packaging, and is pretty well-priced for what you get.  </li>
      <li>Animal friendly too.</li>
      <li>i originally thought this was a leave-in, and the bottle says it isn&#x27;t, but i still use it as a leave in just on my roots.</li>
      <li>Great for dry hair in the winter - I swear by it.</li>
      <li>Have gone through many large bottles and the quality has always been consistent, and has always smelt lovely.</li>
      <li>To me, Terax does have a special smell that is close to my puppy&#x27;s shampoo</li>
      <li>Some people complain about the sent and when you smell it directly from the bottle it does have a strong smell, however once in your hands and after you work it through your hair, the sent of the conditioner smells really nice, and kinda soft and neutral its really quite a good smelling conditioner</li>
      <li>My hair looked better after even one use, and the color looked so much fresher.</li>
      <li>When I first applied it to my hair (wet), it felt super smooth, when rinsing it out, again, super smooth, but once my hair started to dry, it felt kind of, not so great.  </li>
      <li>It is a great product that leaves your hair feeling noticeably softer and smoother but never weighed down or greasy.  </li>
      <li>Came exactly as described!</li>
      <li>Honestly, my hair feels different the moment i put it on - silkier, stronger, softer.  </li>
      <li>Worth a try.</li>
      <li>but honestly they should be giving a few more ounces for the cost...    </li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
      <li>I left it on for 15 minutes and the results, were far more than I&#x27;d hoped for!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true, it really does stink (a lot)</li>
      <li>If I use Crema, combing it is easy, and it looks soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t judge it on first smell.  </li>
      <li>Works great for thick, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightly fragranced &amp; never heavy on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly, but fine hair, and I like to wear it straight.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works better than any other conditioner that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every high-end product on the market.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot for it to feel like its doing its job.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>this product so much.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel very silky.</li>
      <li>so I am very picky when it comes to choosing hair products since it is so close to my nose.</li>
      <li>I have processed blonde hair and even so, my hair always look healthy and feels soft.  </li>
      <li>I can comb through my hair easily and I don&#x27;t have to leave it in long to see a difference.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my hair is my best feature.  it is thick and shiny and i love to take good care of it.  i use a lot of heat styling products so i&#x27;m always looking for a good conditioner.  i have tried just about every salon brand conditioner - Aveda, Bumble&amp;Bumble, Matrix, Biolage, BedHead, Paul Mitchell, Frederick Fekkai -- the list goes on... this is my favorite.  Honestly, my hair feels different the moment i put it on - silkier, stronger, softer.  it&#x27;s amazing.  my blowout looks better, and stays nicer longer.  it has a lovely smell, cute/retro packaging, and is pretty well-priced for what you get.  i promise you will be a convert too.  enjoy!!</li>
    <li> I never received the product.  No updates were ever given.  Will not order from vendor again. Need to get a refund.</li>
    <li> My hair is sooo soft.  I bought this on a recommendation and I am so glad I did!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! The tiniest amount detangles all of my shoulder-length hair and leaves it so soft. The smell is great too.</li>
    <li> I got this to try out because of the good reviews I saw on here...I have long thick straight hair..I tried putting a little in to begin with..Didn&#x27;t do the job...Then I put a ton more in...Still didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair..It doesn&#x27;t help untangle hair at all..It makes my hair feel like hell..Redken is definitely winning compared to this crap..</li>
    <li> Very nice and quick order.  Came exactly as described! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Exellent conditioner......have been using it for years.  I apply to my wet hair before shampoo and leave it on about 5 minutes, rinse and then shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Exactly the daily conditioner that works for dry, tangled over-processed hair like mine.    I purchased this conditioner a few weeks ago after reading several good reviews. I&#x27;m a hair product junkie and have anywhere from 2-6 types of shampoo and conditioner in my shower at a time. My hair is dry and damaged, plus it&#x27;s thick so anytime it gets wet it&#x27;s just a tangled mess. I&#x27;m always tyring new conditioners trying to find one that works for me.    This is it. I only need to use a quarter size amount instead of twice that for other conditioners, and it immediatly softens and conditions. I can comb through my hair easily and I don&#x27;t have to leave it in long to see a difference. I can throw out all my other conditioners and just use this one. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used products from the Terax line for over a year now and they&#x27;re great. I always get compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair is. This conditioner makes my hair soft, shiny and I never have split ends. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It is a great product, doesn&#x27;t react with my skin as many other conditioners do. I will reorder again. Makes my hair&lt;br /&gt;soft and manageable without adding weight to it. Love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  After only one use, my hair felt amazingly soft!!  I left it on for 15 minutes and the results, were far more than I&#x27;d hoped for!!  I live in Florida, where the humidity is killer--can you say major league frizzies?!  Anyway, I was surprised that the Terax took care of my unruly hair with no other products or blow drying.  I was frizzy-free!!  Others have praised its de tangling capabilities, but I had a few snags, during comb out (I have long, thick, hair).  When I first applied it to my hair (wet), it felt super smooth, when rinsing it out, again, super smooth, but once my hair started to dry, it felt kind of, not so great.  I thought to myself, \\&quot;Uh-oh!  Costly mistake!\\&quot; but once my hair dried completely, it was really nice, with a very noticeable change in condition.  One more thing, while researching the Terax crema, I read many conflicting reviews about its smell--it smelled wonderful, it smelled so bad, one person couldn&#x27;t use it, and everything in between.  I was sort of confused, and there were enough negative comments (about the smell) that I almost didn&#x27;t buy it.  It&#x27;s true, it really does stink (a lot) when it&#x27;s in the bottle, but once you put on your hair and rinse it out, it smells quite wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner I use. It&#x27;s expensive, but totally worth it. I have coarse, thick, dry, color-treated hair, and without a good conditioner, I can&#x27;t get a comb through it. This stuff works better than any other conditioner that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every high-end product on the market. This is my favorite, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> i used this a while ago after i saw my sisters hair (so smooth and glossy.  I loved it. used it up. got something else.  always come back to terax.  it is the best!..i am going to try the shampoo next.  i recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Crema is a professional salon quality product that transformed  my hair from the scarecrow to the good witch of the north.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product until I became vegan and started looking at ingredients. This product used to either smell very bad right away, or a while after the bottle was opened. I learned that tallow is beef fat, so that is the cause of the bad smell. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all because raw, organic coconut oil works so much better for conditioning than this product. Coconut oil is much more economical too.</li>
    <li> Since I have stopped washing my hair with shampoo, I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference in the quality of my curls. Instead I use conditioner to clean my scalp instead of shampoo, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out as much. Now that I&#x27;ve added Terax Crema to the equation, my hair has been better than ever.   I used to switch conditioner every time because it didn&#x27;t seem to matter, even if I bought expensive salon conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using Terax for about 4 months and it still works great!   Plus if you sign up for a subscription you get a percentage off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this conditioner just when I was done with my Moroccanoil conditioner. I am always a big Moroccanoil hair product user but decided to try something new when I saw the awesome price and great reviews for Terax on Amazon. I have to say it does give your hair a smooth/silky texture but I still have tangle ends when I try to brush through my hair with my fingers. I have really sensitive sense of smell so I am very picky when it comes to choosing hair products since it is so close to my nose. To me, Terax does have a special smell that is close to my puppy&#x27;s shampoo but it does not bother me at all. Overall, this hair conditioner did not impress me so much that I would recommend people to purchase. If you have colored/damaged/straight/thick hair like me, I highly recommend Moroccanoil conditioner. I think it works a lot better than Terax.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for 5 years.  I have tried others but nothing compares to this product.  It is the best and the smell of my hair after using Terax is so luscious!  Molly</li>
    <li> I have used this hair conditioner off and on for about ten years now.  It is a great product that leaves your hair feeling noticeably softer and smoother but never weighed down or greasy.  I&#x27;ve used it alongside different terax shampoos but usually with the Miele Shampoo.  Worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  When I ran out, I went back to my old brand and it just wasn&#x27;t the same.  You feel the difference after just one application!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a DAILY conditioner (not a deep moisturing conditioner) this is a good one and fairly priced.  A little goes a long way!  My daughter and I both have long hair, and Terax does a great job of detailing our hair in the shower so that we&#x27;re not pulling it out at the roots when brushing or styling.</li>
    <li> I love Terax products for my hair! This conditioner is the best I have found. Makes my hair feel very silky.</li>
    <li> I love Terax conditioner, it is great!  I have thick curly/wavy hair, and this conditioner works amazing and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot for it to feel like its doing its job.  Some people complain about the sent and when you smell it directly from the bottle it does have a strong smell, however once in your hands and after you work it through your hair, the sent of the conditioner smells really nice, and kinda soft and neutral its really quite a good smelling conditioner so don&#x27;t judge it on first smell.  its so thick you can put it in your had turn your hand over and it just sits there. It is purely just good stuff, no extra water to help stretch it out, just good stuff. I use to  rotate my shampoo and conditioners, now just shampoos, i tried another conditioner and seriously thought it was some old school 2in1 pert plus. Once you try this conditioner and get use to it, it is so hard to use another conditioner.  Also this conditioner is good for all hair types, my friend who introduced me to this product has kinda thin limp hair, and works really well on her hair, it doesn&#x27;t way your hair down like other conditioner, it makes it soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seriously have made experiments of my hair...leaving it at times very dry, split ended and honestly just dead. This product works miracles. I have used many many expensive products but never feel like they work like this one. Try it</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. Can&#x27;t live without it. BUT, it&#x27;s a total ripoff. I take it because it&#x27;s great product but honestly they should be giving a few more ounces for the cost...    Anyway, my hair swears by it.</li>
    <li> I love Terax products. Very happy with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great. Leaves my hair feeling silky and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my hairdresser and haven&#x27;t used another product since.  I have processed blonde hair and even so, my hair always look healthy and feels soft.  It smells great too.  I also mix a little with water in a spray bottle and use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair as a detangler.  Also, my hair is very fine but Crema doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  You can leave it on for as little as 2 minutes, or for a deep conditioning, 15 minutes.  Would highly recommend this product.  Animal friendly too.</li>
    <li> I have tried every kind of conditioner over the years, including the higher priced brands (Bumble and Bumble, Kerastase) but this one is still the best.  My hair looked better after even one use, and the color looked so much fresher.</li>
    <li> i originally thought this was a leave-in, and the bottle says it isn&#x27;t, but i still use it as a leave in just on my roots. i have long hair that i highlight, and this keeps the ends from being frayed, etc</li>
    <li> By far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! I have very long, thick but fine hair that easily knots and gets dry at the ends. If I use Crema, combing it is easy, and it looks soft and shiny. I even get compliments! And I love the smell. Have gone through many large bottles and the quality has always been consistent, and has always smelt lovely. It&#x27;s expensive (Amazon is the cheapest source I&#x27;ve found) but worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands, but I keep coming back to Terax. This conditioner is the best I have EVER tried. It smells great, gives amazing shine, and isn&#x27;t heavy. I just wish it were a little less expensive!</li>
    <li> I have oily scalp and dry hair.  I have tried everything; store brands, salon brands, Wen, salon deep conditioning treatments, home remedies, Argan Oil, Keratin treatments, blah, blah, blah....My friend recommended Terax Conditioner, I had just bought more expensive salon conditioner and waited until I had used it.  When I finally gave Terax a try, I was sorry I had waited.  It is amazing.  I usually have to put all sorts of oils and waxes on it to tame the frizzes, ever since I started using Terax I don&#x27;t have to put anything else on my hair unless I flat iron.  I only need three products for my hair now.  Shampoo for every other day, Terax for everyday (every other day I rinse and massage my scalp without shampoo and then use a little Terax), and a little pomade for when I flat iron.  My hair has NEVER been soft and shiny....until now. And a little goes a long way.  I have been passing the recommendation along and have gotten the same positive feedback from all my friends.  I finally have the pretty, shiny hair I have always longed for.</li>
    <li> Very rich and makes my dry hair feel soft and have used it for years now please don&#x27;t stop making it...</li>
    <li> This conditioner was recommended by a high end cosmetics store in town.  I tried a sample &amp; was hooked.  It&#x27;s lightly fragranced &amp; never heavy on my hair.  Accompany this experience with one of Terax&#x27;s shampoos &amp; you&#x27;ve got a winning combination!</li>
    <li> Not the big deal its made out to be! I&#x27;m a hairstylist and have used a lot of different conditioners and didn&#x27;t see the big deal with this one. It did smell really good.. It was just ok</li>
    <li> Ever since I started bleaching my hair I swear by this stuff.  It&#x27;s a splurge by my standards, but I just scrimp on cheapo shampoo to offset the $$.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best conditioner in the world!!  I have naturally curly, but fine hair, and I like to wear it straight.  After using Terax just once, I noticed a considerable difference to the texture, shine, and overall look of my hair.  My hair is more manageable, and so I now wear my hair wavy.  Plus, the light, clean scent is great.  I know it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> Just a dab will do!  Saved my color treated hair from pool and beach damage.  My hair is soft and manageable!  Incredible product</li>
    <li> Works great for thick, curly hair.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much .  Smells great too.  Lasted a few months and i wash my hair daily</li>
    <li> I have tried it all, nothing and I mean nothing comes close to this product!&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee that your hair would never have a bad hair day when you use this product whether you use it as a conditioner or hair treatment it works a treat!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product so much.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My daughter and I both have fine hair and hers tangles very easily. This is the best conditioner for smoothing out the tangles and the frizz.</li>
    <li> Love this product, been using it for 15 years. Great leave-in for curly kinky hair. No other product comes close.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Terax Crema as a conditioner for years and it is the best.  The key is to ring the water out of your hair before putting it in.  My hair feels softer and healthier from using Terax.  It is my favorite hair care product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, especially in the summer when sun, sea water and pool water get my hair all damaged.  I leave it on twice as long as the bottle says sometimes, just bring a magazine into the bath tub and read while un-doing damage.  It moisturizes without leaving my hair oily.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CONDITIONER.  I WORKS ON ALL TYPE OF HAIR AND WEAVE.  I WOULD AND HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Great for dry hair in the winter - I swear by it.</li>
    <li> I like this product. To me it smells great, the scent stays in your for a while just like you get your hair done at a Salon they scent of the products stay in your hair, so I dont know why people complained so much about the scent of this product.</li>
