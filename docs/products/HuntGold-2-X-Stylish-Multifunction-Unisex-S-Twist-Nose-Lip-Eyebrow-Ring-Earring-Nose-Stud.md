    <li> They are to big for me</li>
    <li> I really like this nose ring would like another one but different</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to put it in my nose.</li>
    <li> Super excited about this product.  My only complaint is that one of the earrings was missing a ball to secure it closer.  At least I can still wear one of them though.</li>
    <li> not what it looked like in the picture</li>
    <li> I got the multicolored ones and I do love the way they look, but they are a pain to get on and off. I&#x27;ve been wanting to change them for a while but I can&#x27;t because I can&#x27;t get them out of my ears!</li>
    <li> Not impressed. My nose is already stretch to a 16 and these will not go in. If you have a regular sized piercing do not buy these they will not work for you! The balls were tight and extremely hard to get off. Then they were extremely hard to screw back on. Not a horrible product for the price but also not what I was expecting or needed. I&#x27;ll find some kinda usey for them.</li>
    <li> Arrived 12 days earlier than estimated!  Good quality. You may need pliers to loosen it initially.</li>
    <li> Stretched out ear holes. The balls just wouldn&#x27;t stay tight.</li>
    <li> I got 4 and they were way too large for a nose ring. I&#x27;m highly upset</li>
    <li> They came faster than I expected but I could only open one of them. The balls were screwed on too tight.</li>
    <li> The balls won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> I was only able to use them for my belly button bc it was too thick for my ear and nose! &amp; I bought 3 packages of 2.....but they are great for the belly button so that&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> These are pretty cool. The gauge is bigger than what I got my nose pierced with so it was hard to get in and the ball is hard to put on. But other than that, it looks cool.</li>
    <li> Too wide for my nose piercing..this width is more suuted for the ears if u ask me</li>
    <li> It was too thick for me or my sisters nose hole.  It made my sisters bleed</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t use items because the balls would not screw off.</li>
    <li> the item is too large for your nose or ears. needs to be smaller</li>
    <li> Its really had to get the end put back on but very stylish and cute!</li>
    <li> This came with 2 of only the silver color. Yes, it is for multi-use. I currently only use it for my cartilage piercing. It is great for cartilage piercings. However, the gauge is really thick. If you have a small pierced hole, I do not recommend it for that, unless you&#x27;re willing to stretch the hole.</li>
    <li> Was a little big to be a nose ring, but still very cute.</li>
    <li> I was highly disappointed for what I received was not what I order. The ones I order were supposed to be colorful and made for multiple piercings. What I received was a plain belly button ring piece; I&#x27;ve tried messaging before though I got no reply. I f I could get a call back id appreciate it 443-477-0721</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly to me !</li>
    <li> nice can&#x27;t get it in my ear though</li>
    <li> I cannot get the balls to come off on either side!!!</li>
    <li> Looked good and seemed sturdy, however looked very awkward and oversized in my nose. Didn&#x27;t get the chance to get used to it though, because the ball that holds it in place came loose and fell off during the first night I had it in. Not impressed.</li>
