      <li>There is no timer or automatic turn off, so when the water gets to low while you are using it, it makes a VERY loud noise until you shut it off.</li>
      <li>This hot and cold feature is an even better practicality.</li>
      <li>Do find the cool mister a plus except it doesnt seem to sit and stay tight very well, and the stand itself is a little flimsier than I would like but have had no major issues and</li>
      <li>I wish the arm for the hot steamer was a little longer or at least was adjustable to move like the one for the cool steam.</li>

    <li> This steamer so far has been an 8 out of 10. LOVE the steam side but do wish the metal nozzle was a little longer. Do find the cool mister a plus except it doesnt seem to sit and stay tight very well, and the stand itself is a little flimsier than I would like but have had no major issues and this price is great</li>
    <li> Defective merchandise very cheap contacted buyer several days ago with no response . Boiling Water came out of water tank from all over . I do not recommend this product at all</li>
    <li> Broke after 5 months Not good</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;the cool vapor arm leaks.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my old stand to make it more sturdy and it worked out well&lt;br /&gt;The cool vapor leaks at the seam.&lt;br /&gt;I tied it together just it does not look as professional as it could&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**As of March 10, 2015 the entire steamer is broken nothing works, piece by piece it has all fallen apart.&lt;br /&gt;The last steamer I bought in 2008 still works. I am pulling it back out of storage.</li>
    <li> Yes, the machine is good.  It is plastic, but it holds together nicely.  If it seems wobbly to you, there is a hex type screw under the wheel base you can tighten from time to time.  The only reason not 5 star is because the cold water nozzle isn&#x27;t holding strongly yet.  I have to see if I&#x27;m doing something wrong is trying to connect it to the base.</li>
    <li> I really wish I would&#x27;ve returned this before it was too late.&lt;br /&gt; The head of the steamer broke almost immediately. I took it apart to find the plastic ring inside the nozzle cracked and broke. I tried to find a replacement at home depot with no luck. So, I taped it up and have been using it taped up ever since because I need to use a steamer daily. unfortunately... I cant adjust it at all.&lt;br /&gt;The cold water chamber is almost impossible to clean and got mold.... NOT GOOD!!!!&lt;br /&gt;waste of money</li>
    <li> Not a good product! Invest in something better! Not a good quality professional grade! Did not work when it arrived and not in good packaging.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have the cool mist and the hot steam. I have allergies and I have used it when I was congested in addition as a facial steam and exfoliating process.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all this item is made with ship plastic,Inestable with no balance whatsoever , preatty dangerous for be a steamer</li>
    <li> Cheap and awkward to use</li>
    <li> Have been getting alot of customers raving about this machine. The steamer works great cool mist is slow but steamer is 9/10</li>
    <li> I purchased this steamer in Dec. 2012, then I purchased a 2nd one 1 month ago...they are now BOTH BROKEN. The first one worked only 4 months...the 2nd one lasted through ONE FACIAL. Company won&#x27;t stand behind the one I purchased in December, so that was a total waste of my hard earned money. The 2nd one now will have to be repacked and sent back (at MY expense). BUYER BEWARE. If I could have made this ZERO stars, I would have.</li>
    <li> Steamer is good but came with a missing piece searched for a number to call so that the piece could be sent to me but no number could be found</li>
    <li> I rate this item a 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;it was well packaged.  Each piece was wrapped..  This led to the delima.&lt;br /&gt;there was no instructions. none.&lt;br /&gt;I had to guess as to how to put it together. No instructions, pictures , nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Then when I plugged it up he hot came on without me turning it on and stayed one till I un plugged it.&lt;br /&gt;The light worked.&lt;br /&gt;The cold worked.&lt;br /&gt;The hot stayed on as long as it was plugged up..&lt;br /&gt;A bad switch I guess.&lt;br /&gt;So I had a big mess on the floor, had already used it, no way I could get it back to new condition.&lt;br /&gt;So, it gets a 1 star.</li>
    <li> Works but doesn&#x27;t stay up slide down when filled with water.</li>
    <li> excelente producto cumplió con las expectativas, llego lo indicado y hasta ahora ha funcionado a la perfeccione es un producto confiable seguro que cumple lo necesario</li>
    <li> Out of order in one year</li>
    <li> Apparently there is a sensor that indicates if water ( in the hot part of the steamer ) is too low or too high. The steamer makes a loud buzzing noise if this happens. I thought the steamer was broken till I ran it a few times to make sure I noted the issue was a indicator that was undocumented in the feature section. ( or at least I hope that&#x27;s the issue )  I don&#x27;t like the fact that I am unable to contact the manufacture to ask if in fact that is indeed what&#x27;s going on. Otherwise I love the hot/cold feature.</li>
    <li> Very good product!! Really happy 😀</li>
    <li> I have used a similar product being only the steamer.  I never had any issue.  This hot and cold feature is an even better practicality. It is very easy and simple to use while mobility is excellent.</li>
    <li> Spend a few more dollars and get a better steamer this one is terrible</li>
    <li> For the most part it gets the job done. I like the look of the machine and I like the price. There are a few things that could be improved. I wish the arm for the hot steamer was a little longer or at least was adjustable to move like the one for the cool steam. There is no timer or automatic turn off, so when the water gets to low while you are using it, it makes a VERY loud noise until you shut it off. (not good while you&#x27;re trying to give a relaxing facial. I do love the cool steam, I have never had one before and really like that option! All in all for the price, you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for our spa.  They do not go high enough and the head will fall off sometimes if you try to adjust so water goes everywhere!  Also, the leg of the steamer broke after only a few weeks.  The steam itself works great, so that&#x27;s why 2 stars instead of 1.  Good for private or home use, but professionals, buy a professional product.  It&#x27;s work the extra $$</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it has hot and cold steam. It has been working very good! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the basin that holds the water for steam is made from plastic and it has already cracked. I am notifying the seller to see about a replacement or a few replacements.</li>
