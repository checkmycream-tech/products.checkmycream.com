### Positive Reviews

      <li>THE BEST moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Definitely a win all the way around!</li>

      <li>One star is too many!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is a very nice moisturizer that glides on easily and moisturizers well.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m still in the process of finding something effective.)</li>
      <li>Great smell and a clean but moisturizer feel.</li>
      <li>Evaporated very easily.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, puts back softness and moisture to hands and body.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many of the &amp;#34;yes to the carrots &amp;#34;products.</li>
      <li>Have been using it for more than a year.  </li>
      <li>love the smell..</li>
      <li>my favorite moisturizing agent - love the smell of yes to carrots, the softness of my skin and everything else about this product.</li>
      <li>I find that they are high-quality and are fit nicely with my skin care needs.</li>
      <li>This has always been one of my favorite brands of body lotion.  </li>
      <li>I love this product line.</li>
      <li>I love YTC body butter</li>
      <li>The lotion won&#x27;t absorb, it just sits on top of my skin and does not help my dryness.  </li>
      <li>I love yet to products.</li>
      <li>Moisture lasted all day, not greasy, amazing light scent.</li>
      <li>I love this body wash.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and non-greasy, goes on smooth, moisturizes well, and has a mild, very nice smell.</li>
      <li>It makes my hands soft and beautiful.</li>
      <li>So rich and emollient!</li>
      <li>The natural ingredients are great too.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and it moisturizes pretty well.</li>
      <li>This is a good lotion with a kind of weird - but pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>lotion does exactly as it says - it claimed 24-hour hydration, and it has been doing exactly that!!!</li>
      <li>For heavier moisturizing (at a reasonable cost), I prefer Alpha Hydrox Silk Wrap Body Lotion which is better for exfoliating but lacks the anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best lotion and only lotion I use regularly.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something more natural and this fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Overall this product is great for the whole family.</li>
      <li>The lotion has a light, pleasant smell that sticks around all day, and it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy on your skin.</li>
      <li>My hair has never been so soft and silky, and the body wash feels so hydrating in the shower! :)</li>
      <li>Also knowing its 98% natural makes me feel better about what I&#x27;m putting on my skin.</li>
      <li>The lotion is more natural and no paraben which i&#x27;m trying to avoid.</li>
      <li>I went through a bottle much more quickly than I usually do, but that was because I used it much more frequently since I loved it so much.</li>
      <li>Decided to try all natural product and was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>My hands down favorite favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>I first tried samples of it in Target and have been buying it ever since.  </li>
      <li>I had never tried the brand \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; before, but I&#x27;ve been making an effort to switch to more natural/organic types of cosmetics and such, and this is an affordable alternative to brands like Aveda, Kiehls, and Origins.</li>
      <li>I love YES TO products, especially this lotion.</li>
      <li>This product is definitely worth the price and it lasts quite a while since you don&#x27;t have to use that much to moisturize your skin.</li>
      <li>Using this for years, first time buying on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I love the entire Yes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great -- would definitely recommend for other people with itchy legs.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell identical to the body butter at all, very chemical like.</li>
      <li>Not greasy, yet it is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I would recommend these to anyone who wants to take care of their skin.</li>
      <li>And the price is CHEAP on amazon compared to regular stores.</li>
      <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
      <li>Moisturizes really well, but that SMELL.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s asking too much.</li>
      <li>I kind of smell like raw potatoes.</li>
      <li>If you have pretty healthy skin, this would probably be a decent everyday lotion.</li>
      <li>Because it does leave an odor, I switched to using it only on my legs where it&#x27;s softening effects were more obvious and the odor wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
      <li>it absorbs easy and actually moisturizes for several hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a smooth, non greasy formula that definitely combats dry winter skin better than other lotions I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>You only need a one pump for each leg (a little goes a long way), and when I change into pajamas in the evening, my legs are still silky smooth and hydrated - for the first time in my life!!!</li>
      <li>Has a very soft sent.  </li>
      <li>Since the ingredients are all natural I used on my three year old son and it kept his skin baby soft.</li>
      <li>I bought this so that my hands would stay soft.</li>
      <li>On the box it says that it is 97% natural.  </li>
      <li>Just because products say natural means nothing.</li>
      <li>This is a natural product without the chemicals.  </li>
      <li>My 8 year old daughter even noticed the smell.</li>
      <li>Not many products have been able to live up to that, especially ones not loaded with a bunch of chemicals.</li>
      <li>Maybe if you have normal skin to begin with and just need a tiny bit of hydration then this is the lotion for you.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feel instantly soft with no greasy feel, and has a very delicate baby powder scent which I love.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very natural and light so there isn&#x27;t any irritating perfumes or bothersome smell to it.</li>
      <li>Leaves my dry skin soft and moisturized!  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the extra few dollars compared to cheaper brands!</li>
      <li>My skin felt soft with no particular odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> I can have dry skin, especially as the weather changes.  </li>
<li> This lotion is non greasy but absorbs really well into dry thirsty skin without feeling thick or sticky.</li>
<li> That said, I still use it, but with a dry skin type you might want to consider something else to help moisturize.</li>
<li> My daughters and I tend to have dry skin and get rashes in the winter.</li>
<li> my skin was so dry all over again.</li>
<li> After less than 1/2 hour, it had totally soaked in (no stickiness).  </li>
<li> Not sure how it&#x27;s different than the total repair version.</li>
<li> The air here can get super dry and cold (-30 F), so I need something that keeps me hydrated the entire day, because I can&#x27;t be reapplying it to my legs like I can do with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> But if you have dry skin like me then this is certainly not gonna do anything.</li>
<li> so you won&#x27;t see scaly skin a few hours later.</li>
<li> Weird, right?</li>
<li> I use other products from this company I like, but I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>

    <li> I have tried many of the &amp;#34;yes to the carrots &amp;#34;products. I find that they are high-quality and are fit nicely with my skin care needs. I would recommend these to anyone who wants to take care of their skin.</li>
    <li> Deceptive marketing strategies, disappointments, waste of hard earned money, and a bunch of hype! One star is too many! Just because products say natural means nothing.</li>
    <li> Decided to try all natural product and was not disappointed! Moisture lasted all day, not greasy, amazing light scent. Since the ingredients are all natural I used on my three year old son and it kept his skin baby soft. My husband also uses this and likes that the scent is not strong or feminine smelling. Overall this product is great for the whole family.The price on Amazon is the best compared to in-store prices! This product is definitely worth the price and it lasts quite a while since you don&#x27;t have to use that much to moisturize your skin. After trying this product I am hooked! I am changing all my skin care products to YES TO CARROTS!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It&#x27;s light and non-greasy, goes on smooth, moisturizes well, and has a mild, very nice smell. I&#x27;ve carted this bottle of lotion on a road trip across the US because I didn&#x27;t want to go without it.</li>
    <li> I work in the medical field and constantly wash my hands. I bought this so that my hands would stay soft. This is not that lotion. It was watery, not creamy. Evaporated very easily. Would not buy his again.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion with a kind of weird - but pleasant smell. It takes a little while for it to absorb into the skin, and its a little sticky, but it does the job. I was looking for something more natural and this fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes really well, but that SMELL. Ick.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice moisturizer that glides on easily and moisturizers well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because Paula Begoun gave it a Best recommendation because of it&#x27;s ingredients (anti-oxidants) and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After bathing last night, I generously slathered it on my arms and legs.  After less than 1/2 hour, it had totally soaked in (no stickiness).  My skin felt soft with no particular odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this product is moisturizing enough for me to use all the time.  For heavier moisturizing (at a reasonable cost), I prefer Alpha Hydrox Silk Wrap Body Lotion which is better for exfoliating but lacks the anti-aging ingredients.  I will alternate the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: After 3 months of use I do have to say that this product makes my skin softer.  Because it does leave an odor, I switched to using it only on my legs where it&#x27;s softening effects were more obvious and the odor wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> The lotion is more natural and no paraben which i&#x27;m trying to avoid. It smells nice and it moisturizes pretty well.</li>
    <li> My hands down favorite favorite lotion. This lotion is non greasy but absorbs really well into dry thirsty skin without feeling thick or sticky. The scent is very natural and light so there isn&#x27;t any irritating perfumes or bothersome smell to it. And the best part is the lotion lasts all day so you won&#x27;t see scaly skin a few hours later. The best time to apply is after a shower and you&#x27;re good to go but it&#x27;s great anytime. I use it all year round!!! And the price is CHEAP on amazon compared to regular stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been hard to find a lotion for my dry skin in Wisconsin Winter weather. The air here can get super dry and cold (-30 F), so I need something that keeps me hydrated the entire day, because I can&#x27;t be reapplying it to my legs like I can do with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion does exactly as it says - it claimed 24-hour hydration, and it has been doing exactly that!!! You only need a one pump for each leg (a little goes a long way), and when I change into pajamas in the evening, my legs are still silky smooth and hydrated - for the first time in my life!!! Woohoo! I will DEFINITELY be repurchasing again. Totally has become my holy grail body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have been using Yes To Carrots shampoo and conditioner, and their body wash, and I can say that all of these work wonders! My hair has never been so soft and silky, and the body wash feels so hydrating in the shower! :)</li>
    <li> I am trying to use products that do not test on animals, but I was very disappointed in this one.  The lotion won&#x27;t absorb, it just sits on top of my skin and does not help my dryness.  I use other products from this company I like, but I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Terrible! I love YTC body butter so I bought this to have a pump style lotion on my desk. It has a weird brake cleaner style odor to it. It doesn&#x27;t smell identical to the body butter at all, very chemical like. Very sad to have wasted the $$.  UPDATE- seller refunded and did not require return shipment. I added a star for that, good seller!</li>
    <li> Leaves my dry skin soft and moisturized!  Not many products have been able to live up to that, especially ones not loaded with a bunch of chemicals.</li>
    <li> This has always been one of my favorite brands of body lotion.  I first tried samples of it in Target and have been buying it ever since.  It leaves your skin feel instantly soft with no greasy feel, and has a very delicate baby powder scent which I love.  The natural ingredients are great too.</li>
    <li> Love this! NO SOY!!!! YIPPEE!!!!</li>
    <li> my favorite moisturizing agent - love the smell of yes to carrots, the softness of my skin and everything else about this product.</li>
    <li> I used a sample of this in Target and loved it. I waited until it was a little cheaper and bought it. It works well and isn&#x27;t greasy or anything but since I bought it I noticed that after a while of wearing it I kind of smell like raw potatoes. Weird, right? My 8 year old daughter even noticed the smell. I like the stuff but for the price and smell I probably wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> On the box it says that it is 97% natural.  I can have dry skin, especially as the weather changes.  My skin loves Yes to Carrots.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a oily residue.  Glides onto skin well and your skin will drink it up.  Has a very soft sent.  Not overpowering stink that some lotions can have.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.  Have been using it for more than a year.  It smells so good to me.</li>
    <li> I like that this is an all-natural body care product, but as a lotion it&#x27;s just not moisturizing enough. I put it all over my arms and legs after shower in the morning, and within just a couple of hours my skin was so dry all over again. Am I supposed to reapply this product several times throughout the day, while at work? No way. I need a product that I can apply once after shower and it keeps my skin moisturized for 24 hours. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s asking too much. Maybe if you have normal skin to begin with and just need a tiny bit of hydration then this is the lotion for you. But if you have dry skin like me then this is certainly not gonna do anything.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years. Love it! You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It&#x27;s the best lotion and only lotion I use regularly. It makes my hands soft and beautiful. I don&#x27;t like going without it. There&#x27;s even times during the year when I use it more frequently, i.e. when it gets cold. I also like every other Yes to Product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love yet to products. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I had never tried the brand \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; before, but I&#x27;ve been making an effort to switch to more natural/organic types of cosmetics and such, and this is an affordable alternative to brands like Aveda, Kiehls, and Origins. The lotion has a light, pleasant smell that sticks around all day, and it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy on your skin. I went through a bottle much more quickly than I usually do, but that was because I used it much more frequently since I loved it so much. I can&#x27;t wait for my next Subscribe &amp; Save shipment to arrive!</li>
    <li> Does everything a moisturizer should!  I love this product line.</li>
    <li> I bought and received 5 Yes To Moisturizing Body Lotions from Yes to Carrots and all of the bottles smelled rancid.  I was truly sad because I love their lotion and it&#x27;s hard for my local stores to keep it in stock.  I returned all of the bottles to Amazon.</li>
    <li> My legs used to be so itchy I would scratch them until they bled, and no lotion I could find would help until I found this lotion. It&#x27;s great -- would definitely recommend for other people with itchy legs. Not sure how it&#x27;s different than the total repair version.</li>
    <li> I love YES TO products, especially this lotion. love the smell..no doesn&#x27;t smell like carrots and like how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, puts back softness and moisture to hands and body.  This is a natural product without the chemicals.  I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a little thinner than the body butter version (as it should be) and I like that it absorbs easy and actually moisturizes for several hours. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is that it smells like maple syrup to me.</li>
    <li> I have quite a few bottles of this now, through subscribe and save. It has a subtle scent and rubs in well--not too oily or too watery. Its biggest selling point, to me, is the lack of parabens and SLS too often found in lotions. If you have pretty healthy skin, this would probably be a decent everyday lotion. My daughters and I tend to have dry skin and get rashes in the winter. This lotion, unfortunately, does not prevent that, no matter how vigilantly we apply it throughout the day. That said, I still use it, but with a dry skin type you might want to consider something else to help moisturize. (I&#x27;m still in the process of finding something effective.)</li>
    <li> THE BEST moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells great, and makes my skin feel wonderful. I will be buying over and over again!</li>
    <li> Great ingredients for your skin at a great price! So rich and emollient! Not tested on animals which is very important to me! Definitely a win all the way around!</li>
    <li> This lotion feels and smells great. Not greasy, yet it is very moisturizing. I will purchase this lotion again and again.</li>
    <li> only lotion used in our house anymore!</li>
    <li> I love the entire Yes To line of products, and this lotion is definitely on par with the rest of them. It&#x27;s a smooth, non greasy formula that definitely combats dry winter skin better than other lotions I&#x27;ve found. Totally worth the extra few dollars compared to cheaper brands!</li>
    <li> Smells like baby butt rash medicine.</li>
    <li> Using this for years, first time buying on Amazon.  Guess this says it all.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with eczema several years ago.  I started using this product a couple of times a day and have had no problems since.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. Great smell and a clean but moisturizer feel. Also knowing its 98% natural makes me feel better about what I&#x27;m putting on my skin.</li>
