<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m so satisfied by this product. At first I thought of buying a cheaper one but eventually the extra few bucks def&#x27; worth it. Super ultra kit with a powerful battery and a full range of accessories. If this will last for a decade the most then I&#x27;m SUPER Satisfied :))&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that my girl loves my beard now... much more than before!! Initially she didn&#x27;t like beard man at all but slowly she got used to it (under protest)... but now.... She&#x27;s in love! Ha!</li>
    <li> Low build quality - does the job</li>
    <li> This trimmer  works well for the cost.  My only comment is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand or storage system.</li>
    <li> Comes complete set, so far so good, but the best part is washing it under water!</li>
    <li> After my last trimmer died, I shopped around for a while before I settled on this trimmer as a replacement. I had a few qualifications as I shopped that included (1) some sort of battery indicator so I would know when it&#x27;s low and when it&#x27;s done charging, (2) I wanted it to be reasonably priced (preferably under $40), and (3) I wanted all of the cutting parts on the main trimmer to be metal. This trimmer was the only one that met my qualifications.    I&#x27;ve used it several times now, and it&#x27;s done a fantastic job. It cuts evenly, the attachments fit perfectly and work well, and the battery indicator is superb. It&#x27;s washable, like all trimmers should be, and the \\&quot;turbo boost,\\&quot; while unnecessary for my density of facial hair, would be nice if mine were any thicker (or if I waited a long time between trimmings). It is also surprisingly quiet. My only complaint is that the number indicators (that show you how long you&#x27;ll cut your hair) seem to be a little bit off: so if you want a 4 beard length, better set the indicator to 6. Also, just so you know, the indicator is small, but contrary to other reviewers, it is not too small. Additionally, the stand is low-grade plastic, but I never planned on using the stand, so that&#x27;s not an issue for me.    If you&#x27;re considering this over the \\&quot;Philips Norelco QG3330/42 Muligroom\\&quot; (the cheaper version of this trimmer), BUY THIS ONE. The alternative has more plastic and no battery indicator.    UPDATE:  I realize now that the length indicator is in millimeters, so I did some quick conversions to get the same lengths I used with my last trimmer and now I have no problems with it. It seems strange, though, that it marks millimeters while every other trimmer I&#x27;ve used measured by 1/16 of an inch.</li>
    <li> Great product !&lt;br /&gt;So fast charging and really powerful. I lost the same trimmer and I bought the same !&lt;br /&gt;Really good to cut my beard and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Adjustable height attachments work well, trims nice, holds a good charge after only an hour, like the visual charger status icon, fits well in palm of your hand, good price for a good product. Like to keep my beard trimmed fairly close; this product works well to achieve my desired look.</li>
    <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed this gadget. It comes with a number of different fittings so it is so functional. It also small enough that it can be brought on trips and the battery holds a long charge. Every man should have this puppy in their war chest.</li>
    <li> I recommend when using mode to shave the mustache area is cut by raz</li>
    <li> Well i am using this for some time now but you know what the blade now has loosen its sharpness which is not at all acceptable from a product of this price and by philips , highly disappointing</li>
    <li> This kit is perfect for all grooming needs,  from cutting hair to trimming beard and nose hairs. I have an all in one self grooming package to replace my old one that was getting worn out now. It charges very quickly and lasts a very long time. More than a few days at least with good amount of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even comes with a tray to keep things organized. You can even lay it down in its spot while it&#x27;s charging. The only thing I wish is that the tray was black,  not blue.  But that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Length-of-cut adjustment of plastic comb is a bit crude, but functional--much &amp;#34;cheapened&amp;#34; (from my 10-year-older Norelco that I finally replaced) and more difficult/frustrating to select length-of-cut position--small, difficult-to-see numbers, and crude/awkward grooves that snap/engage and hold the comb in position.  Absolutely love the new lithium battery system: very quick charge, AND can be used directly from 120v plug in if charge runs down--this was a MUST-HAVE for me. I am satisfied with the cut and results which are the same as my older model.</li>
    <li> Good product....but the outer cover feels like cheap plastic</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price and does everything you&#x27;ll need it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice to have the charger cord as a standard micro/mini USB for convenience while travelling, but that&#x27;s a minor gripe.</li>
    <li> Good product in general. Easy to use, works cordless or while plugged in, relatively simple to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of minor issues with the attachments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the interchangeable heads, there&#x27;s a white grease that hairs stick to. I tried to clean it but it also wipes off the grease, which looks like was put in there for mobility of the heads. Not really sure what to make of that. Cleaning the grease completely doesn&#x27;t seem to be that easy either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with 3 plastic heads that can be put on top of the main trimmer head. Two of those three heads are only guarded on one side, meaning that the plastic only covers one side of the metal moving trimmer. So if you hold it tilted at an angle that&#x27;s off, it will make your hair/beard shorter than the setting you put it on. There&#x27;s only one plastic head that is guarded on both sides. So no matter how you hold the trimmer, your face stays a certain distance away from the trimmer. This gives me the most flexibility in terms of shaping my beard, and I would assume it would be the same with your hair as well. So to me, the other two plastic heads are pretty much useless. And I don&#x27;t know what I would do if this one double-guarded head breaks. They look sturdy, but they are all plastic after all.</li>
    <li> USED IT TO CUT HAIR &amp; IT WORKED FINE.</li>
    <li> Exactly what he needed!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is the bombdiggity.  The end.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Xmas gift and it was great for about 2 months until it suddenly stopped working</li>
    <li> I purchased my 3364 at my local Walmart.  I was very satisfied until it quit working after 7 month.  5 Stars for funciton.  2 stars for failing so quickly.</li>
    <li> Had the previous model with the NiMh battery and was pretty happy.&lt;br /&gt;switched to this one (Li based) so i dont have to empty down the battery before charging.</li>
    <li> Everything about this clipper is great.  Battery life is good, the quality is good, EXCEPT for the guard.  It&#x27;s a cheap plastic connection with the unit that slips, wobbles and gives you an uneven trim.  If you don&#x27;t need to use the guard, I would rate this 5 stars.  But if you use a guard and adjust the guard and can&#x27;t have it slip or give you an uneven trim - GET ANOTHER TRIMMER!!</li>
    <li> This unit is not made well nor does not preform well.  It&#x27;s like they tried to make something that could do it all with 7 different attachments!  So far not happy and would not recommend this to anyone with more than Peach Fuzz.</li>
    <li> battery is quite durable</li>
    <li> great quality especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Worst beard trim I ever had, uneven cut, scalped in places. Very poor design for guide....use the wrong angle and it&#x27;s bare skin mode, never happened with the Wahl.this was a replacement for a Wahl Groomsman that I dropped and broke. Going to order another Wahl unit, I tried this because unlike Wahl you can rinse it off and I have a triple header norelco I like very much.</li>
    <li> it looks good and functions well.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. Works as advertised and is worth the money.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this trimmer. When the first one he had used for several years was dropped and broken, he was so glad that we were able to find the same model again. He likes it for its versatility and ease of use. It&#x27;s a very good value for the price.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awesome! Super easy to clean out after use and has every attachment we could ever need. I also like the tray everything came on. It fits nicely in our bathroom drawer to keep everything organized. We&#x27;ve purchased super cheap trimmers in the past and they&#x27;ve always left us wondering but decided to spend a little more on this one and we&#x27;re glad we did. We&#x27;ve used it on battery power and also while having it plugged in. There is always enough power. The mini foil razor attachment isn&#x27;t great but I find that the areas that would be useful I prefer using a regular razor and shaving cream vs an trimmer anyway.</li>
    <li> It meets my expectation &amp; make me happy :)</li>
    <li> The best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommended. Especially for very short beard trim.</li>
    <li> More than expected. Great value. Now to see how it holds up to regular use.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this trimmer. While overall, it is well made, the &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34; part is whats no good. The clip that you put on it for different lengths of the beard is no good!! meaning, while trimming, if you tilt the trimmer, you can have variations in the length. I messed up my beard BIG TIME. Plus even with &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; on, it did not seem like it had that much power. So I had to return it. Oh well, I&#x27;m going back to good old Wahl.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t charge. It lasted one and a half times.  5 stars if you would like to spend money to have half a beard.</li>
    <li> It works so well and so easily.  It&#x27;s a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> I use this shave for a multitude of reasons. Head, chest, nose, neck, um... Well... You know... So far no nicks or cuts. As a bald man, it&#x27;s nice to have the different attachments to use for a variety of reasons. The guards work, but be conscientious of the length it&#x27;s actually cutting at. Used one set of guards to trim my eyebrows as they were getting a little unruly. Let&#x27;s just leave it that as a bald man with pale eyebrows, those that don&#x27;t know me may mistake me for a chemotherapy patient on appearances alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great set of clippers and it does everything I need and more. I also like the turbo setting. Not sure it actually creates a better or faster cut, but c&#x27;mon! It&#x27;s turbo mode, man! Isn&#x27;t everything better with a turbo?</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this trimmer. By far the best one I have ever used. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Good Product, i like it</li>
    <li> Its amazing and meeting all my requirements.</li>
    <li> I just like this product , its so soft and working very well. Don&#x27;t think about this product just buy it..</li>
    <li> I just got my Norelco few days ago and what can I say.... just perfect. Its easy to use and very powerful, charging time is very quick, it&#x27;s light weight and it feels good in hand. Maybe its not the best in the market, but is the best value for the money</li>
    <li> this works great!  It doesn&#x27;t pinch any hairs when shaving, and unlike my old trimmer, this product actually can be used when charged into the wall.  How is it possible that some other shavers don&#x27;t do that??</li>
    <li> Does the job, nice battery life.</li>
    <li> I had an older philips Beard Trimmer  that I lost in a trip. This trimmer is so bad compared to the older version. You may not notice that if it will be your first trimmer. I wish they have sticked with the older version</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad as a birthday gift, he loves all the trimming options.  He is super happy with it!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Bought for a bday present for the hubby.</li>
    <li> Works great for trimming the beard.  Holds charge for a long time and charges quickly also.  Very glad I purchased worth the money.</li>
    <li> exellent !! ...and you can use everywhere...100 to</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as closely as my last clipper even when none of the attachments are used.  Foil attachment is next to useless, won&#x27;t shave unless you use dabbing movements instead of stroking movements.  On/Off switch seems flimsy, need to press it right in the middle for it to work.  I have a feeling its not gonna last too long, I hope I&#x27;m wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery is fantastic though, charges really fast and lasts pretty long.</li>
    <li> Works well, the interchangeable heads are somewhat flimsy</li>
    <li> This is a really good set of clippers. It works equally well on your facial hair and the hair on your head. You can rinse the parts off in water and you can use it on the charger which is a feature I really appreciate because my previous clippers couldn&#x27;t be used while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer with some nice accessories.  The trimmer already has decent power but the turbo mode provides extra power when you need it.  The operation is smooth and it does a great job on my beard, the mini foil shaver does a great job of fine-trimming on the edges.  The last Norelco trimmer I bought lasted almost 10 years, this one looks like it&#x27;ll last at least that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great accessories, turbo mode, the beard comb provides a very smooth and even cut.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You have to remove the beard comb from the trimmer before you can remove the trimmer and use the other accessories....this was not the case w/my last Norelco.  Swapping the accessories can be a bit cumbersome but it&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:  The numbers for the beard comb are not the same as my previous Norelco.  That discovery cost me an eyebrow...but it&#x27;ll grow back. lol</li>
    <li> Functions well and does its job. The built-in battery provides a decent power so I don&#x27;t have to plug it in to shave my beard. It is quite convenient to have it on my trips. Love it a lot.</li>
    <li> Good quality and works well but all of the extra heads are kind of unnecessary. The foil shaver attachment is useless. I, personally, would have been satisfied with the lower model. All in all a decent purchase however.</li>
    <li> Works very well - lots of flexibility with allfo the attachments.</li>
    <li> I love the base unit.  However, I am not sure how to use all those attachments (for hair lengths).  But since it serves my purpose, I am a happy camper!</li>
    <li> Item as described and shipped promptly Recommend to all A+++ Thanks</li>
    <li> Pretty nice trimmer.  Good for the price.</li>
    <li> works as listed, looks and feels durable and works better than my old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the price listed this is a very good buy.</li>
    <li> Replacement for one the did not last long. Normally a great product.</li>
    <li> Going back to the cheapo model, I hate these new trimmer guards they trim unevenly!!!!</li>
    <li> after I first received it I had my doubts about the Philips Norelco but now that I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times, I find it to be a very useful trimmer my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t purchase it sooner</li>
    <li> Exactly what the face was looking for</li>
    <li> I think I got a used one. The tape in my box was open.</li>
    <li> Yes, this does it all.  I replaced a 10 year old trimmer that stopped holding a charge.  This is very adjustable and allows trimming my facial hair longer than most.  The ear/nose adapter is much better then the little battery one I was using (I just threw the battery one away).&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is pretty easy, but I do have to clean up the sink &amp; counter after use.  I don&#x27;t think the vacuum attachment of other models is worth the effort and expense.</li>
    <li> Not easy to clean, hair gets stuck inside the heads. Stopped working after 5 months of use.</li>
    <li> I wanted that one for my beard it was too bad for that but I think it&#x27;s good for hair.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Doesn&#x27;t rust. Recharges easily. Comes with plenty of combs. Be aware that the combs are a bit non standard and kind of flimsy, but they work fine.</li>
    <li> It is vibrating a lot with high sound</li>
    <li> Battery is great. Trimmer attachments are not the best w proper guard numbers</li>
    <li> Good one. It depends on your skill to get it all right, but again everything is like that.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Make sure that you read what each attachment is for and use them as described!</li>
    <li> Awesome all in one plus it can be rinsed. Good battery life. Almost bought it for 39$ at dept store. Thanks amazon</li>
    <li> Good but not great. For my needs, it all works well except for the beard trimming attachment. The length guard is too pointy and somehow just not at a good angle or something -- I found it difficult to use. The guard on the Philips Norelco QT4050/41 Beard Trimmer 7100 is much better. The two are inexpensive enough that I am using both -- the latter for the beard, and this one for everything else. I would have preferred to need only one of them.</li>
    <li> It works great ! They always have good products !</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my wahl which I had for a couple of years but the battery wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge.  Took a chance with this one and so far, its been pretty good.  Only issue I have is that I always seem to need to have Turbo on.  Without it on, I don&#x27;t feel like it will cut the hairs on my beard and it runs slower than my wahl did.  Attachments are nice but be careful, you don&#x27;t want to be to rough as they are plastic.  Changing the heads is simple and easy as well.  Comes with a nice bag to store everything in.  I would rate this a 4.5 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> For the cost (got it with a $5 coupon), I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this trimmer because I am growing a beard and don&#x27;t want to look like a Java developer. Friends of mine, of a variety of development backgrounds, recommended a pricier trimmer of the same brand, but honestly this one does the trick. The interchangeable heads work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guards/guides for trimming can be a little flimpsy and finicky, but they do the trick. I imagine that part of the issue is using it at a setting of 13-15 when it only goes from 1-18 (in other words, the guard is almost fully extended, so sure, plastic might wiggle a bit).</li>
    <li> Clean is not easy and de low cut is high.</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Absolutely hate having to switch out the attachments and heads.  It takes some getting used to.  Its not like the G370 where its a simple pop in. For this shaver, you have to line up the notches, push it in, and twist to lock in place.  It gets confusing at first because the trimmer faces a different way than the foil shaver.  Also, the three different combs, do not slide in and out with ease.  It seems I add new scratches everyday to my Norelco trying to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;- The holder for the attachments is unnecessarily HUMONGOUS, cheap looking, consumes a lot of counter top, and still does not hold attachments well.  Mine came in blue color that sticks out like a sore thumb in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;- Unlike the older Norelco All-in-One shavers/trimmers like G370, you can&#x27;t plug in your power cord to the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Looks more expensive and sleeker&lt;br /&gt;- Curved design to the heads makes it easier support the weight and shave/trim.  With the G370, you had to hold the shaver up almost perpendicularly to catch most areas.&lt;br /&gt;- Quieter&lt;br /&gt;- Turbo option.  I haven&#x27;t fully tested it out.  Sounds like it is working in higher gear but I don&#x27;t that it makes a difference in terms of cutting.&lt;br /&gt;- Shapes better, mustaches, beards, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the design still needs work and could be a lot more user friendly, I do see some improvements. I however will not be stockpiling these shavers any time soon.  For now, it is what it is...</li>
    <li> Does the job but the arrangements are too delicate</li>
    <li> Very good product. Poor casing.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Would have liked a charging carrier or some type of protection of the head when not in use.  Otherwise, the trimmer works wonders and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> The item is as described. Delivery was prompt without hassle. A*****</li>
    <li> Trims down to near-stubble levels nicely.  Battery charges quickly and holds charge well.  Turbo boost is a nice touch and is a noticeable bump in power.  Easy to mount/remove attachments, very easy to clean.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Broken after ~8 months!. Spare you money and buy something else</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic components broke after a few months use.</li>
    <li> I bought this after buying the Wahl groomsman t-pro. Glad I did. Initially I thought I was in for the same experience (pulling rather than cutting, underpowered motor) and expecting that turbo mode was going to be the only useable mode, but I was very pleased with the performance in the standard, as well as the turbo modes. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars as I&#x27;m never going to give up hope that someone will make a trimmer that feels like it could power a space station and cuts like a handheld, motorized, face-based Silky™ blade. That my friends, will earn 5 stars...</li>
    <li> A must in every man&#x27;s locker. Does the job great. Learn to use all the options and sport different styles and enjoy the compliments! Love It</li>
    <li> This is not the best shave , I have it for a month or so and mu hair get stuck inside the motor and I have to clean the motor every time that i trim my beared and neck. I was dissapointed to see how bad was the battery and quality of this prodouct, never seen such a low quality product from philips though!</li>
    <li> I had an older model that worked great for 3+ years. Easy to clean and easy to use and switch heads. for the price of a set or razors you can buy this and get a close shave. the extra attachments come in handy. Im getting older and ear hair is becoming an issue LOL. trimming up my beard or getting the right amount of stubble is much easier with the improvements from my older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for a few pennies more the next model up comes with a body groomer, if youre into that.</li>
    <li> Quality beard trimmer for the price.</li>
    <li> Out of the box, the trimmer would not charge; hence, it would not work.  I have ordered a replacement and hope to amend this review once I have a working trimmer.</li>
    <li> After one year of use the metal trimmer part got loose and it moves when the trimmer is on, so it cant stay still while I am using it, making a lot of noise and even hitting the combs, this also happens with the shaver, and in the philips page the metal trimmer costs $15 USD</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;ve had a beard and/or mustache all my adult life (numerous decades) so have a lifetime of trimming and grooming experience. I left my professional clippers with my son so he could keep his buzz cut in order and picked up this item for trimming my beard. There is one huge short-coming to using this for trimming beard length. The attachment that creates length has teeth that do not extend beyond the actual clipping blades. The only way to ensure proper, consistent cut length is to keep that attachment precisely flat on the face. Any forward tilt at all and you are clipping closer. Remember, the teeth on the attachment don&#x27;t extend past the cutter so that is the pivot point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A face is not a flat surface, but a series of curves and angles. There is this thing called the chin, another called the jawline. With this unit you run the serious risk of creating what I would call scalping or divets in what you were hoping to be an evenly groomed beard and mustache.  I&#x27;d take Philips up on its 45 day return policy but I&#x27;ve already disposed of the packaging material.</li>
    <li> powerful, fast and doesn&#x27;t need charging after every use</li>
    <li> The actual trimmer works great but the attachments are worthless, as they don&#x27;t seat close to the trimmer and will ruin your beard because you cannot consistently engage the depth properly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a previous generation of this product for several years. It was still going strong when my kitten chewed through the charger cord.&lt;br /&gt;This model is at least as good quality as the older unit and the battery life, which was the previous model&#x27;s only shortcoming, is much better.&lt;br /&gt;The only feature this model doesn&#x27;t have that the top of the line model has is &amp;#34;take it in the shower&amp;#34; water resistance. This one is splash proof but not immersible. That&#x27;s fine with me seeing as how this model was on sale at a much lower price than the top model and although I have an immersible razor I never use it in the shower. Save money and go for the 5100.</li>
    <li> I used to have another one from another brand and i wanted to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;It s a very good one, very precise and does the work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I use it just to trim my beard. Very good !</li>
    <li> Great replacement for an older unit. Glad it works on 110 and 220V.</li>
    <li> Over 2000 years ago, a poet born at the cradle of civilization recorded for all of history to read that there is a season for everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A time to laugh, a time to mourn.&lt;br /&gt;A time for peace, and a time for war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could add an additional stanza, to his poem, I would add: &amp;#34;A time for beards and a time for no (or less) beards.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s still a work in progress. Don&#x27;t judge me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dropping my last electric beard trimmer in the shower and watching it explode (I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced), I had to order a replacement trimmer. I went to a big box store and compared prices with Amazon and even on the low end price points, Amazon was about ten dollars cheaper. I ordered this one as I noticed it was fairly middle of the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an opportunity to shed my winter skin, err, beard and trim up some of the wild growth caused by harsh Midwest winters. The trimmer came with many attachments for beard and hair trimming, a snap on nozzle for those wild nose and/or ear hairs and a number of other attachments that I&#x27;ll probably never use. It has a turbo button (reminds me of old 386/486 PCs) that should just be removed by the manufacturer and always left in the on position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger included with the trimmer has a really long cord. I&#x27;m glad because the last two I&#x27;ve had were too short to be of any good use, especially if I had a dead battery and had to plug it in for use. Included in the package is a small canvas-y type carrying case which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself does a good job of cutting. It doesn&#x27;t pull or tear out your manly fibrous rope-like beard hairs but instead cuts them. In fact, it cuts so well that a series of blades so fine must be named as in the days of old when great swords were forged and used to conquer nations. I shout, in my bathroom, at my beard, &amp;#34;with this blade, I cleave thee,TETRAGAMMATON&amp;#34; and then I go to work trimming my nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Very good groomer.thanks</li>
    <li> High quality, reliable, user-friendly item.</li>
    <li> This is a nice grooming kit. My old one died because of lack of care for the battery. Make sure you don&#x27;t leave it unplugged for a long time. I bought a new one and all the attachments are transferable. Totally beats paying 15$ for a haircut each time. It will cut too deep or too shallow if you don&#x27;t use it at the right angle consistently. Just keep the attachment flat on your head and you will look good afterward. It is really not as bad as one guy who reviewed this item makes it sound.</li>
    <li> First off, the heads provided to regulate length don&#x27;t work. They need to be held exactly parallel to the shaving surface or you will get an uneven trim. Most heads from other trimmers are designed so that if you change the angle you are holding the trimmer you won&#x27;t accidentally lop off too much hair. Not the case with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the trimmer heads can take off too much hair, the nose hair trimmer does literally nothing. I jammed that thing up my nose and dragged it all around the inside of my nose and it cut precisely zero hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very unforgiving. They have cut me a few times when I&#x27;ve used them, which is a problem I&#x27;ve never had until using this trimmer. This thing and all its cheap accessories will live a lonely life stored in the handy carrying bag that it came with on the dusty top shelf of my bathroom cabinet.</li>
    <li> Great product at a fair price</li>
    <li> Very durable and charges well.  I had an older version of this clipper that my son kept borrowing so I upgraded to this one and gave him the older model.  Both Norelco items are quality goods.  A little more expensive than most but it gives you many attachments for all kinds on trimming, and hair cutting.  Highly recommended by somebody who has used Norelco for years.  Still charging, still trimming well.</li>
    <li> My son says its great for him. Its his first one and he loves it. compact and easy to store in between uses. Lightweight. looks cheap but works great. I have seen more expensive look just as cheap&lt;br /&gt;pretty good buy.</li>
    <li> Lots of cutting options, takes care of all men&#x27;s needs. Recharges quickly and runs while recharging.</li>
    <li> Bad quality specially comb attachment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended</li>
    <li> Wow! Ridiculous price for a great product!</li>
    <li> Works well at a very good price.</li>
    <li> It all purpose, heavy duty and operates with cable. Its great product fro Philips</li>
    <li> I have used this for 3 weeks now and man i love it. I had a Phillips before but it was a skinny one made of all plastic. This is made of plastic, but it has a more quality feel to it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because i spent $50 on it, but the stainless steel head gives it a nice look. I would recommend this for whoever is looking for a nice all in one shaver, trimmer, etc</li>
    <li> 5 Stars for everything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a norelco shaver for about 6 years now, but it was loosing the ability to hold a charge, and giving spotty results on the shave so I thought i&#x27;d upgrade/replace my old with this one. I shave my head (no guard) and trimmed some body hair after the first charge. Without the guard is a closer cut then my last norelco, but hey I&#x27;m loosing it anyway, so what does that matter. It trimmed nice and even and quickly. the big surprise was the chest trimming. with my old trimmer it would be itchy and aggrivated for a day or 2 after a trim down (not shave but a #4 or #5 guard). but last night and all of today has been itch free.&lt;br /&gt;now the one thing I would change for how I use it, and that&#x27;s the location of the power button. During my trimming and shaving I accidently hit the power button and turbo button repeatedly. My old trimmer had a sliding switch which made it more difficult to accidently shut it down. A small issue, but one I can see driving me crazy over the years of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else seems to work just fine and I love how quickly it charges. I&#x27;d buy it again, and recommend it to someone looking to buy a solid trimmer for their beard or head.</li>
    <li> Cheap, feature rich.Good performance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a full beard and have used this trimmer for about a year now for that and also to cut my hair. I travel all the time, and, while doing so, some of the teeth broke off on the beard comb a couple of weeks ago. I contacted Philips Norelco through a chat session on their website and they sent me a free replacement beard comb. Great product and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do..</li>
    <li> Cuts very close to produce designer stubble for my husband.  He loves it and has not yet used all the features.</li>
    <li> This trimmer/groomer is the best one I have owned in the last 15 years.  It is sturdy, holds it charge, has excellent &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; that actually work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time to trim my beard and &#x27;stache.  My only neg, is the the disposable factory packaging stops just shy of being useful as a permanent storage case.</li>
    <li> The 5100 works good. I&#x27;m not sure why they have the turbo mode because you have to always use it, they could have just eliminated the regular mode. I had the less expensive model and it worked well also but the 5100 seems to be built more solid. Yes for $30 I would buy this product again</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer with a quality feel. Lots of attachments for beard, mustache and hair. No complaints.</li>
    <li> It was pretty good, Does the job and I liked the price!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely helps neaten the otherwise bushy beard, would recommend if any1 is looking to keep a neat beard and styled.</li>
    <li> Value for money..Good quality.</li>
    <li> I want to like this groomer so much!  But, sadly, it is just mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;- I like the adjustable guards as they reduce the number of loose pieces.&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life has been pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;- The large clipper attachment is great.&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used while plugged in (It&#x27;s crazy that this is not a standard feature, but it&#x27;s not)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not-so-good:&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer and shaver attachments are needlessly small.&lt;br /&gt;- micro-screen shaver tends to get clogged easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; kind of product.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco clippers and trimmers  and shavers for  over 40 years . This multigroom 5100 is outstanding.</li>
    <li> Powerful little unit. I have used it to trim facial hair as well as give myself a buzz cut. I have thick coarse hair and it handles the job well without being plugged in. I have not run the unit until the battery was dead, but got two days steady use with no problem. Less one star because the unit is loud! I do have a small concern that the noise from the unit is not from its power, bit the assembly. If I place pressure on some joints with my fingers, it is not as loud. But so far I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> It has nice shaving gadgets, but the length adjustment tool is a bit hard to push for desired length of hair.</li>
    <li> Problem with the recharge and the adapter can&#x27;t make it work without doing pressure on it... check the picture to see where i have to compress to make it work.</li>
    <li> Really great product, cleanly shaves the curves of my neck better than any other products I have used.</li>
    <li> very good for multi shaving</li>
    <li> Had to replace my seven year old Remington trimmer after dropping it on a ceramic tile floor.  Found this one during an Amazon search.  Reviews sounded good, so I tried it.  Good move, Pete.  I was initially worried about the size of the rakes, but after using it a few times find them to be great. I use this primarily for a beard trimmer.  This trimmer cuts much more evenly than my old Remington, and the rakes look like they will prevent inadvertent gouges.  I wish it had a stand or box for storage instead of a bag.</li>
    <li> Everything I had hoped for, yet more than I expected.  An outstanding product.  I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Charges fast, charge lasts. Cordless, very versatile with useful attachments. Does a great job, reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Feels very plastic and cheap but do the work for now</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. It would be nice if it shaved a little closer, but it&#x27;s only a trimmer, not a razor. I have yet to try it for a complete haircut, but I think it should work fine for that too.</li>
    <li> Works much better than expected</li>
    <li> good, but makes lot of sound and all other accessories are waste they will fail with in 2-3 times of use.</li>
    <li> One of the tools was missing when the package arrived.</li>
    <li> What i like about this trimmer is the rounded edge trimming blades which does not hurt or scratch the skin whether you use it carefully or carelessly. Quick charge and the added corded use feature makes it an all rounder. Attachments are easy to use and the small pouch to carry all these stuffs.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about three weeks now.  I&#x27;ve found the trimmer to be precise and effective when using the trimmer attachment.  I&#x27;ve used it three times, still on the initial charge, and have noticed no decrease in battery power (based on the pitch of the motor).  Although I haven&#x27;t needed it yet, it&#x27;s handy that you can also run it off the power cord if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a much more expensive Andis trimmer (the same one I use to groom my dogs) prior to the Norelco.  The smaller head and battery power of the Norelco, as opposed to running a power cord for the larger Andis, make it a pleasure to use, and the results look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments of the Norelco are not all equal, however.  The two close trimmers (one larger than the other) are very effective, as is the rotary trimmer for my fellow geezers out there.  The two combs are very handy, as they let you try trimming your beard at different lengths quite easily.  The foil shaver, though, is useless.  I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to cut a single or multiple days growth.  The so-called storage box (so described on the Norelco website) is nothing but a thin plastic display/shipping tray.  You&#x27;ll need to make other storage arrangements at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently traveled with the &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; bag (as noted above, the &amp;#34;storage box&amp;#34; won&#x27;t do the job) and was concerned that a severe bump would break the attachment off the trimmer, and that the attachments rattling around in the bag would break as well.  You can&#x27;t travel with nothing attached because there&#x27;s a little lubricated pin sticking up from the trimmer.  You&#x27;ll lubricate everything in the travel bag and/or break the pin.  I&#x27;ll be looking for a small box that will provide storage and a more secure travel option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased overall with the Norelco.  My main purpose in buying it was to have a more accessible beard trimmer, and this trimmer is really very good.  It is fairly loud, and the bladedoes eventually get hot, but that&#x27;s friction for you!  I don&#x27;t find either the noise or the heat to be a problem.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and powerful.  Better than my other Norlecos of the past.  Although I bought it for stubble shaving, it also easily shaves the hair on my head on &amp;#34;Turbo&amp;#34; setting.  Charges completely in about an hour.</li>
    <li> The battery dies after one shave. Nothing else matters after that. For the record it does cut well and the water resistance is wonderful along with blades that don&#x27;t need oiling. However, a SHAVER THAT NEEDS A CHARGE BEFORE EVERY SHAVE is ridiculous. I read other reviews that said there was a battery issue and thought &amp;#34;well there will always be a few unhappy customers.&amp;#34; Skip this thing because there IS a battery problem :(</li>
    <li> The electronics in this are so cheap and poor they don&#x27;t last. After 3 of them, all dying within months of each other it&#x27;s time to move on to a different brand.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great and is very light and compact! Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Excellent all around product.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed.  I have a Norelco shaver and it&#x27;s great.  I bought this because I recently decided to rock a little stubble.  I usually use a comb with an old Remington, but thought this would simplify the process.  The stubble adapter is actually the length of a trim beard, so it didn&#x27;t work well for that purpose.  Great trimmer outside of that and I can see how it would work well for a short beard.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really beat the price for everything you get. However, the only problem I could find is the fact that hair gets trapped inside the clippers very frequently.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! Perfect price point and with all the best trim heads &amp; trim tools.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other negative reviews on here.  The quality of the plastic guards is terrible.  Without a doubt--these are going to break.  This trimmer also grab the hairs as opposed to my Remington.  I am returning the Pilips Norelco and will continue to use my Remington until I find a satisfactory replacement.  I am considering the MANGROOMER Ultimate Pro Body Groomer and Trimmer.</li>
    <li> Charges very fast. Easy to use. Cleaning is difficult.</li>
    <li> 4 stars because I have to buy a foil shaver, otherwise it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> Multi purpose, good for haircut. But not so effective for shaving as it does not shave for hard beards</li>
    <li> The problem with this trimmer is that the groomer attachments are difficult to adjust, and the indicator mark on the attachment is so small you almost need a magnifying glass to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groomer attachments use a very difficult friction slide adjustment and they feel flimsy. Unlike the Norelco G370 that I owned previously (and really liked-but it&#x27;s been discontinued and is more than twice the price on Amazon that I paid retail), the adjustments are just too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power sags and gets erratic at times, even for this fully-charged unit which I&#x27;ve only had for three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy another brand next time.</li>
    <li> I Shave once or twice a week and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just trim my beard and moustache down to one of the lowest settings, and its quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, just rinse and let it dry, lots of settings if you need other used out of it although I haven&#x27;t tried them.</li>
    <li> I didnt like it, changing attachements were a nuisance and overall it did more than I wanted it too.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it. Please, someone explain to me how to use the beard attachment without taking uneven chunks of hair out??? The blades are exposed and if I use the plastic guide even on 1mm it cuts nothing. Worn out with this thing</li>
    <li> Exactly as described - durable, water-resistant and a BIG step up from the lower end models.</li>
    <li> Just received the trimmer today. This will not be a full review since I really did not have an opportunity to put it to work I looked at several trimmers, read reviews and ultimately decided on the Norelco. My main use will be for maintenance of my goatee and to trim my neck and around my ears.  I charged it and within a few minutes there was enough juice to turn on. First impression is that it feels cheaply made. The plastic is flimsy but it does feel decent in my hand. The Wahl, that this trimmer replaced, was better made, a bit heavier and a lot louder than this Norelco. The motor is quiet but seems underpowered for someone who has a thick beard or goatee to maintain.  My wife did use it to trim my neck and she says it worked fine. The instructions are basically useless, the groomer attachments (not the trimmer head attachments) are difficult to attach and the trim level numbers are next to impossible to read. I personally do not like the design of the groomer attachments.  I will update the review in a couple of weeks after more use. I hope this trimmer lasts as long as the Wahl trimmer i had.    Update 8/25/14:  The battery finally died on 8/24/14. I used this trimmer ever day for roughly 30 sec to 3+ minutes. The battery is exceptional. Much longer than the other trimmers Ive owned.     Since I am a fairly hairy person, it does a nice job of maintaining the hair on my legs and arms. I like to trim them at least every three days to keep everything even.    The attachments are decent but takes some getting used to. The nose hair trimmer does a good job as well.     The biggest issue I have is it SUCKS at trimming neck hair. My wife tried it two times and she hated it. She shaves my neck every three days and this trimmer cant even trim it close enough. That&#x27;s a big disappointment since this is the main reason I bought the trimmer.    With that said, I really cant complain. I paid $29 for the razor, there was a $5 coupon witch reduced it to $24.95. Four days laterit was $14.95. I emailed Amazon and they refunded me $10 so I only paid $15 for a trimmer with a lithium ion batter. Too bad it doesnt do a better job of cutting the neck hair.    One thing I want to point out is this trimmer is quiet- It also doesn&#x27;t seem to have the power needed to trim neck hair. Maybe Philips should increase the power/torque to make it a more powerful unit.    If you are looking for a trimmer to use for neck hair, then this isnt the one for you. If you want it to maintain a beard or gotee and arm and leg hair, then I would recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say the Full-Size Metal Guard Trimmer is NOT wide enough. It is quite noisy while working. Good thing is the charger is efficient.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  He said the brades are much sharper than his old shaver.  It charges in 1 hour, that&#x27;s another great point of this shaver.</li>
    <li> Works great, runs on plug or battery</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for one I had for many years this one is even better than the one I replaced.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an older one that broke. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, as advertised. Works great.</li>
    <li> Worked well enough until the initial charge it came with ran out on day 2, product would not recharge after that. Luckily I had an older model (but functional) Phillips trimmer that all the attachments fit on so it wasn&#x27;t a complete loss.</li>
    <li> I purchased this model several months ago as a replacement for an old Remington trimmer. My father and I both use it often for preshaving, and I also use it for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Multigroom 5100 turned out quite a bit smaller than I expected, along with its attachments. Never held a multipurpose trimmer so small before, and it was quite light too. Probably wouldn&#x27;t survive a fall. The glossy finish on the front and neck looks good for marketing but it is not practical for grip nor age, thanks to fingerprints and small scratches. Thankfully the back has grooves and is matte, but some of the attachments face a different way, which is weird and took me a second to realize when it wouldn&#x27;t go on right. The accessories also feel extremely cheap and somewhat fragile. The guide combs are flimsy and could probably break if you didn&#x27;t know how to adjust them properly. The heads have perpetually wet glue on the inside, which was funny to discover. Yeah, glue. Doesn&#x27;t even look like it needed it. The charging cord is probably the most pathetic, little, weightless thing I&#x27;ve ever held; feels quite warm after a charge and it barely stays inside the socket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge time on this is very long, necessitating an overnight charge every once in a while. To me, this isn&#x27;t a big deal. People who use this on the go probably will not appreciate it, and it&#x27;s still something that other trimmers do a lot better. The indicator lights do their job well to warn you of low battery and a complete charge. I&#x27;ve had no issue with the trimmer prematurely failing on me as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary head provides a great, smooth trim with no pulling or irritation, even for my very sensitive neck. It is very loud, unfortunately, and cleaning it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. Trims my head fine with and without the guide combs, too; It never got stuck or bogged down in long hair and the turbo button makes it even smoother. The smaller detail trimmer provides a great pre-shave trim, but it is probably not going to make sensitive skin very happy because it doesn&#x27;t have a guard. The detail foil shaver is the tiniest one I have ever seen, and is absolutely worthless. Extremely loud, extremely uncomfortable, and it barely cuts anything on your neck unless you go over a spot 20 times. The cone attachment is pretty good for the nose, but for nothing else unlike advertised, of course. Actually if careful, the foil shaver is good for around the eyebrows. Long nose hairs may be pulled, though, so this is to be used semi-regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a small brush and a tray to hold everything, but it looks and feels like a part of the packaging, very dumb. Definitely something to shove in the back of the bathroom cupboard or to get rid of altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this for the primary cutting head, but this is hardly the best value. Just get something better like I am about to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a travel charger.  It works great and the battery lasts long enough to leave the charger at home while traveling.</li>
    <li> Multi-function,like it</li>
    <li> This machine is amazing. Does everything it is advertised to do perfectly.</li>
    <li> Cuts the skin without the guard on</li>
    <li> It is my choice,so it fits me well.Wonderful shopping.</li>
    <li> When you have an amazing product in an amazing price, you cant go wrong!</li>
    <li> This trimmer kit works great at first.  However, the connection between the trimmer base and the various heads will wear out quickly.  Once the connection starts to wear out, the heads will shake violently becoming loud, uncomfortable, and ineffective.  If you use this on a near daily basis, expect it to happen within a year.  I have gone through two of these trimmers over the last few years and had the same issue with both.  I was hoping the first trimmer was a fluke and I even took better care of the second trimmer but it still wore out quickly.  I am still looking for the right trimmer for daily use - I&#x27;d be glad to pay more if it would last me a number of years.</li>
    <li> I trim my beard once or twice a week (about 15 minutes of use per trim). Despite some of the other reviews, I have found every tool to be of use. The quality and ergonomics are decent, and nothing has broken in the 8 months I have been using it. My biggest reason for a five-star rating is the battery life. In the last 8 months, I have charged it ONLY THREE TIMES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for maintenance, hairs do find their way into the interior of each head, but they are easy enough to remove for the most part. Due to the brushing out of the hair, the grease on the heads tends to diminish. If you&#x27;re an avid cyclist or auto enthusiast, simply dab a bit of silicone grease onto a toothpick and into the mechanism, and all is well.</li>
    <li> Byootiful. my hair comes off like a butter on a wealthy mans knickers.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews, and it had a lot of good reviews, so I thought this would be a safe bet.  And it is.  The cutter head is all metal, the accessories are good, fit well, and have an adjustment scale.  I&#x27;ve used mine since I bought it a couple of months back, and still on the original charge, so it&#x27;s got a decent battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice little razor.</li>
    <li> Reluctantly replaced my 15 year old Philips trimmer, as a part had cracked and Philips no longer carries parts for it.  This one is way better, great features and so far, works excellently.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer and good deal from Amazon</li>
    <li> I lake I like all kinds of nozzles, light weight, quick charging.</li>
    <li> bought as christmas presents no has complained and they use them.</li>
    <li> Good charge holding time.. Good to use</li>
    <li> works well with many options and adjustments for beard or hair trimming. It is very easy to use and the attachments are easy and quick to change. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it is larger than expected (seems larger than other beard trimmers I have ordered) and does not fit well into the skinny drawer beside my sink in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Good little kit. I bought this to replace a previous Norelco model after using it for many years.  This new kit seems to be carrying on just like the other one did.  Couldn&#x27;t do without all the accessories/attachments but these are a little harder to attach than the previous model. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It does get jammed up easily. I haven&#x27;t used it for long yet so I can&#x27;t write about it&#x27;s longevity. I do like it though. It&#x27;s been a big step up from my last beard trimmer. It&#x27;s fast and clean, I don&#x27;t find myself having to go over the same spot all the time. My beard has never been this well groomed before, haha!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent for the money spent.</li>
    <li> Great machine. I recommend!</li>
    <li> I have had the Philips Norelco QG3364/42 Multigroom Beard Trimmer for approx 6 months and now I can barely make it through 2 beard trimmings without the battery dying. I have to charge it all the time. It use to last weeks and now it last days. I would not recommend this product. Look else where. I now have to buy another trimmer from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Bought this item as I had another Norelco trimmer before that I really liked, but I dropped that one and it broke.  This trimmer is kind of loud.  From the picture it looks like very nice quality, but in actuality is really good looking polished plastic.  Only had a couple days but seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> My quest for a good beard trimmer/ overall groomer has ended, for now. This beard trimmer has finally managed to preform the way I need it to. I had a very old model Phillips trimmer for quite a number of years. It kicked the bucket about 2 years ago. I spent over a year after buying trimmer after trimmer unable to replicate the performance of my old unit. It seemed that they changed the models features and design and I could no longer replicate what I had been used to. Mainly, I needed a trimmer that could keep my heavy beard trimmed to a decent length. Not stubble, but not full on redneck mode either. Every trimmer I tried could trim down to stubble fine, but never would they be able to keep the beard heavy, but not over grown if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the better part of the last year, I found an awesome barber in town, that not only cut good hair, but did beards and shape-ups proper. I have been getting my beard cut and trimmed once a month, with me keeping up the neck line at home with my own crappy trimmer. No more. While I will not cease getting a trim here in town, I will up keep it here every other month. So, cutting (no pun) my expenses in half yearly, it will pay for itself in under 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself is light and quiet. It charges to full in 1 hour, and yields a 50 min trim time when fully charged. So, the days I trim, I turn it off and put it away. The 2 times a month I really go at it, then I put it on the charger for an hour and no worries. The cutting head gets slightly warm after a few min of constant use, no worries there. The head blades are cut so that it glides smooth with no nicking or cuts. Overall, I love this little guy. Would have been 4.5 stars but it&#x27;s either 4 or 5 on here. Nothing in life is perfect, hence the 4 star review.</li>
    <li> The beat product I could get in this price. Has a minifoil shaver for fine tuning and many settings for beard size. It&#x27;s lightweight and battery works for long time. Has turbo for extra power. Deserves nothing less than five stars</li>
    <li> Its the ultimate body grooming kit. easy to use cordless and fun</li>
    <li> Lots of attachments which will never see the light of day.  Beard trimmer is not easy to adjust and I fear will not last long.  I liked by old Braun better.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and useful</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He loves it.  Great price!!!!</li>
    <li> really great.  Note if youre looking for a super close shave the head is quite small.  But the other trimmers work great and dont nick the skin</li>
    <li> I did not buy this razor on Amazon, never had any problems with Amazon in fact the contrary, they&#x27;ve always been great.&lt;br /&gt;But I feel compelled to write a review, my apologies to Amazon, but you are a huge company where most people get their reviews from.&lt;br /&gt;First the plastic fitting is slightly concave so it&#x27;s very difficult to shave with, points at the end are higher then the middle ones, completely annoying.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot use the razor while it is plugged in and charging, this is crazy, deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;Battery stopped charging after six months, cherry on the cake.  Nothing like shaving with a new razor that turns off and pulls your hair, awesome.&lt;br /&gt;The power has always been low and never really was enough from day 1, totally annoying.&lt;br /&gt;The Turbo function is really hit or miss, some times it slows it down, stupid.&lt;br /&gt;Power button is right where you put your thumb while shaving, annoying.&lt;br /&gt;The settings (1,2,3, etc) are not easy to locate, not such a big deal but enough is enough.&lt;br /&gt;And that will do it for me, hope it was helpful for you and Norelco, they should do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your time.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, it is working well, trims closely and stays charged.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Good product, very satisfy with it.</li>
    <li> it took three passes buzzing my head to fall in love with this trimmer. no missed hairs, the system is quiet and made in good construction. charges FAST, one hour and it only took ten minutes to have my hair done. it blows my mind that this cost the same as my first trimmer and is this much better. i was able to find a $5 coupon for this and with another item got free shipping from amazon so i am very happy with this product and would definitely but twice or more!!!</li>
    <li> Very good, holds a charge, good looking, easy to clean, cuts evenly without pulling, I had shopped around quite a bit when I purchased this and it was by far the best deal for all the accessories it provided and its features, such as the lithium ion battery. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> A great versatile Norelco product.</li>
    <li> Without the gauges this is a really good trimmer. But if you put the gauges on it&#x27;s pretty much a sad joke. The gauges are made from really cheap plastic and bend at the slightest bit of pressure causing hair to be cut at really uneven lengths. I went to trim my beard and with one of the lower settings and when I pushed down a tiny bit and shaved a bald spot. Good thing I saved my old beard trimmer, looks like I&#x27;ll be using the old one to trim and this one to shape up. Still waiting to see if my wife will give me enough real estate in the bathroom to store two trimmers.</li>
    <li> Its a worthy product with nice options.</li>
    <li> I just wanted a trimmer that charged quickly when needed, held a charge for a long time and where the &#x27;trimmer guard&#x27; didn&#x27;t slip around after I set it.  This trimmer met all of those expectations.  It charges to a usable level within an hour and since I charged it once it has help its charge with use every few days for about 3 weeks now.  It works great.  The storage tray is pretty useless since it is large and I have no place to put it.  It also came with several attachments that I probably will not use.  But for the low price it was a bargain with a lithium battery and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> makes your face look nice, plenty of attachments and cheap too!</li>
    <li> Nice product!! makes my job really easy!!</li>
    <li> The trimmer is well built and cuts well.  There are a lot of options, but it&#x27;s weakest feature is what it is sold as - a beard trimmer.  The guide combs are tricky to figure out at first.  My first use cost me my beard because the comb indicated for a closer trim is deceptively close.  A month later when I had everything re-grown, I was able to, carefully, start with the longest legnth and work down to the right setting.  The smooth shave attachment is useless and does nothing against a day or twos worth of stumble.</li>
    <li> Such a pain to clean. So many parts. Get a Braun Series 1 Model 190 instead.</li>
    <li> great product....quiet....holds a charge for a long time.....does all I want it to!!!</li>
    <li> It takes a few times to figure out which settings and attachments are right for you, but once you&#x27;ve got that down, it works great.</li>
    <li> I just love this trimmer! It was exactly what I was looking for, I really love my beard but there&#x27;s a point where it stops looking great and starts looking just messy, like if I didnt have time for myself or something like that, with this trimmer I can groom myself, make a great style with my beard and choose the lenght I want, but for what I&#x27;ve done, if your looking for something that will give you a close shave, this thing is not for you, but if your looking for something that will help you give style to your beard! Well I think this is one of the best trimmers you can get for the money!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Multiple heads with multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;Value for money.</li>
    <li> Does a great job.  Holds a charge better than any I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
    <li> great product great price fast shipping</li>
    <li> The attachments seem cheap but decent product overall</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer with all the right attachments. The trimmer is nice and sleek with a nice storage board for the attachments that come with the trimmer. I always had questions on what certain attachments were for with other trimmers as they usually just got stuck into a bag for storage but this one sorts them out nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer turbo button is nice when doing fine or close trimming in areas where hair pulling would hurt. This was the real selling point for me and has been very nice on my face.</li>
    <li> do not use the close shaver near the middles of your eyebrows. it may hurt</li>
    <li> Best price best product</li>
    <li> Light weight, long lasting battery, quick and easy. Has a holding tray too. The battery has performed really well so far, I have used it several times so far and still haven&#x27;t recharged it. Powerful enough for my needs, as I have thick beard hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit difficult to clean though.</li>
    <li> This thing feels like it is disposable.  It&#x27;s obviously designed to last only a short time.  The plastic guards are so cheaply made, it&#x27;s just a joke.  And the length settings are really difficult to use.  Plus, the on/off switch is right where you would like to place your thumb, so it keeps turning off accidentally.  I have purchased many Norelco razors &amp; trimmers in the past that were wonderful products.  But these days it seems like they just get worse every year.  Whoever is in charge of product development there is literally destroying whatever goodwill consumers had for them.</li>
    <li> excellent product, good quality.</li>
    <li> Good quality all in one shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to trim my stubble and trim my lower area lol. It works pretty well and I havent nicked anything yet if  you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts fairly long and whenever your battery is low, the LED light comes up so it gives you enough time to get that last shave before you have to charge it.</li>
    <li> a little disappointed by neck shave, not that close</li>
    <li> always looking for a shaver without the string, the string free shaver is perfect for me, so that I can taking the showing and shaving at the same time.</li>
    <li> Very efficient trimmer, much better than my old Remington (a decent device that simply outlived it usefulness). Two features I really like: 1) it puts a lot of power into the job and 2) keeps a good charge through multiple trimmings. I&#x27;m also pleased with the two trim heads that allow more precision between doing the beard and doing the mustache. If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;d change, it&#x27;s the tray to hold the trimmer and its attachments; it doesn&#x27;t hold some of the attachments as well as it should and could be more compact.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this to trim his beard and hair. Have used it several times a week for over a year, and it works great!</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of beard trimmers over the past year, and this one is my favorite so far.  My beard doesn&#x27;t grow extremely fast or thick, so this simple trimmer was perfect.  I like the foil shaver attachment to finish the job.  Reliability was a problem I had with other trimmers, but this one is rock solid.</li>
    <li> Works way better than expected. Attachment for seven different kinds of trimming. A huge value for the price.</li>
    <li> Performance is great, cuts pretty well. Decent build quality, though it probably won&#x27;t last more than a couple years since the attachments are plastic...</li>
    <li> I cut my hair with them, originally bought them just to keep the beard trimmed - worked better at a haircut than it did trimming my beard. I&#x27;m probably doing something wrong.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it&#x27;s feels so nice on my beard</li>
    <li> Easy to work with and Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> difficult to be cleaned, there is some white waxy substance and the hair stick with it</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my dad for christmas. He absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> It is very good, l like it very much</li>
    <li> Trimmer works as expected. Very nice, gets the job done on my beard and mustache. As a guy with facial hair I think this is a must to have.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer seems very sturdy and well constructed. I had it for about a month or so and use it every other day. Love it. Very inexpensive, and well made product. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected. I just love Norelco shavers!</li>
    <li> This razor worked great fo 3 or 4 months, then the power sort of slowed down and after 5 or 6 months it just stopped turning on even after charging for a day.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected out of this trimmer. The battery lasts more than long enough, and the turbo setting was very useful for thicker areas. All in all good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> does what it says, I truly mainly use the mini shaver and unlike other reviewers I find that it works fine.  I use it for &amp;#34;touching up&amp;#34; so unless you&#x27;re intending to do your whole shaving with it I don&#x27;t see the problem.&lt;br /&gt;turbo mode seems more like a gimmick but without it you still get a decent work out of this, so no problem with that.  so far I&#x27;m still using it from the first charge, so the battery life seems decent.&lt;br /&gt;Like others have pointed out, the &amp;#34;tray&amp;#34; that comes with this IS junk, and it&#x27;s sad to see that Philips/Norelco continues to advertise it as a true organizer when it&#x27;s no less than a glorified packaging piece.</li>
    <li> This took over where my old worn out Wahl trimmer could only have dreamed of going. The attachments are all great work horses and it comes in a nice little case to keep everything. I wish I would have had this before. Thank Amazon</li>
    <li> ITs the best trimer i have use....</li>
    <li> Trims nicely. Not all of the accessories work well, but for its main purpose (trimming), it works great.</li>
    <li> Came on time. does what it says. The only drawback is the trimming attachments that you put on the trimmer that give you longer or shorter shaves are a bit flimsy. But for me, so far so good.</li>
    <li> good trimmer for facial hair. included brush is a little lacking i guess but gets the job done for the most part. i haven&#x27;t yet had to recharge the device so battery life is at least decent. the included tray has a clear cover that can go over all the items when in the tray (how it is shipped).</li>
    <li> Awesome buy did my beard mustache and line. You can&#x27;t get more bang for your buck! Norelco has done it with this shaved. Keeps your beard trim. Foil shaved sucks but everything else is awesome! I look like the barber did my beard</li>
    <li> cheap but high quality!</li>
    <li> This is my first beard trimmer, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  However, I can style my beard with it really easily.  I cut it at about 12 mm, and I like the length.  The comb seems a bit flimsy, but it does a great job.  It has plenty of power.  I have used the beard guard, the ear and nose trimmer, and the fine detail edger, and they all work well.  I&#x27;m wondering if I should have sprung for the one with the vacuum built in, cause this is pretty messy when I trim each week.  Wiskers go everywhere, but otherwise it seems great.</li>
    <li> Very good clipper for the money. My husband loves it and we have had several different brands.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. It recharges fast and holds its charge for a long time. Powerful motor compared to most others, with an additional &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; boost mode if you need even more power. This replaced my Philips Norelco QT4022 Stubble Trimmer Pro I used for years before it finally died. Now that model is discontinued, and remaining stock is being sold at preposterous prices ($200-$300!) I am glad to have found a trimmer that performs as well or better, and for thirty bucks at that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first order arrived DOA, but Amazon customer service was excellent. They cross-shipped me out a new one Next Day Air for free as soon as I contacted them. This one operates flawlessly.</li>
    <li> A little to much for my needs but the boyfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase. Had it for only several weeks but it meets my expectation. Battery charge holds well. Good value!</li>
    <li> Compared to the Norleco G370, this really is an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper, even with turbo, is slow. When body grooming, I have to go over the same area 3-4 times to finally get the clipped result of the G370 just once..</li>
    <li> Great buy and a must have.  Works well with good battery life.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer. The narrow head does not seem to cut all that well.</li>
    <li> This is the best grooming shaver. The storage box does not hold the attachments very well.</li>
    <li> Works great I use it to cut my hair all the time.  Battery holds a good long charge.  Comes with alot of attachments that I dont use.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Only lost a star because they skimped on the storage aspect. They used to provide a nice compact tray for shelf storage that could be easily turned into a charging station. Now it&#x27;s an oversized tray with no such convenience.</li>
    <li> Works as well as any other cheap cordless trimmer sets ive owned....The &#x27;&#x27;Turbo&#x27;&#x27; button on this set is a joke in my opinion, because the turbo button actually operates them at regular rpms like other trimmers ive owned.....If you have the turbo button off these operate below rpm level and are slow to cut.....other then that ok, and does the job alright.</li>
    <li> This is a solid clipper body and clipper head, but the accessories and guards are cheap and unusable.  Do not ever use for trimming facial hair or beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit comes with three adjustable plastic guards with guide teeth that are supposed to dictate length of hair when trimmed.  However, these guards are such cheap and flimsy plastic that they are unusable.  For example, I dialed in 6mm on the 1-12mm guard and trimmed my goatee.  Instead of an even 6mm length, the guard bends with any pressure producing uneven chunks of hair between 1mm-6mm, sporadically.  I ended up with irregular chunks of hair instead of an even goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to shave almost all of my facial hair off to hide the damage this cheap trimmer did to my goatee.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> bought for a  freind, he loves it.</li>
    <li> Nice little trimmer.  I use it several time each week.  Great for trimming stubble, side burns etc.  battery life is good.  Not much more to say, good product and sane price.</li>
    <li> Good Product. This was a replacement to my almost 5 year old Philips Norelco Mutlgroomer. Till now its working as expected.</li>
    <li> light weight and comes with all sort of trimmer heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would wish the tray to put all those accessories was more esthetic like the previous models before like the G370.</li>
    <li> Not worth even for the low price.&lt;br /&gt;CAnt use it for daily shaving...</li>
    <li> I have had 2 (this model and the model below this one w/o the foil razor) of these and I believe their is a design issue with the main clipper (the one that fits with the guards &amp; seen in pic) Over use &amp; changing out other attachments, this one becomes loose and can vibrate very loudly inside of the guard making the trim not as smooth as when it is brand new.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not useful for my Beard.it Can not clean shaven beard。</li>
    <li> This multigroomer does what it says, but not very well.  First off, the on/off button is right wear you would place your thumb while holding it, so you must learn to hold it differently.  No big deal.  Of greater importance though is the settings adjustment on the beard comb.  For example,  you can&#x27;t adjust the height easily from say a 10 to an 11 and so on, because it skips over 11 and goes to what might be a 12.  I say might, only because it use an arrow to point to the numbers on the guide.  And you lose this setting every time you change from the beard comb, to the precision trimmer,  to the mini foil.&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I consider the rapid charger or the ability to use the trimmer with a power cord a major plus, that&#x27;s one of the reasons why I gave it a 2 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximately one year later my opinion of this trimmer hasn&#x27;t improved at all.  Not, only doesn&#x27;t the beard trimmer line up properly with the comb, but all of the attachments have loosened up to the point where they vibrate and are rather loud.  I still can&#x27;t recommend this product and am searching for a replacement.</li>
    <li> razor came sooner than expected, works great so far</li>
    <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
    <li> Ideal trimmer! I mostly use it for facial hair and it works perfect. The battery works as mentioned in the product description. Nothing negative</li>
    <li> It did meet my expectations</li>
    <li> Excellent product, 100% recommended!</li>
    <li> one word &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would be a flexible tool for facial, head and boy hair grooming. This thing did the trick! It allows me to touch up any facial hair, as well as to trim the sides of my head whenever I want. The motor is powerful enough to get through my thick hair, and the battery lasts a long time. The nose hair attachment is great, and the shaver works to touch up anything after trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for an inexpensive way to deal with their facial/head/body hair.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this trimmer, especially the value per the price</li>
    <li> I want to thank the online shop-Sage electronics for excessive care, efficiency and scrupulosity. I give them five stars for there work.</li>
    <li> I researched this product a lot. Great set of features for the price, just wish guides were of more robust construction.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way it cut I send it back</li>
    <li> Use this everyday and has never disappointed me.</li>
    <li> Love it so far, works great!</li>
    <li> Not as impressed as I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a replacement for my old Norelco trimmer that lasted 10 yrs. The issues with this one is the attachments seem to collect hair in them and I see early failure in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not have the blade guards attached to the blades but have to be put on after you change the head. I see this as a future breakage issue as they are made from hard plastic.</li>
    <li> My husband has had a mustache and beard forever, and has tried every grooming tool ever produced.&lt;br /&gt;This was his favorite by far.  Will be re-ordering if ever needed again.  Love the sharpness of the tools, and how quickly it powers up.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice setup. I still have been using the basics so I need to get the instructions out and figure out the details like the length adapters and adjustments</li>
    <li> I have tried many trimmers around the 40$ price range,and this one is my favorite.I really like that I do not need to oil it ,and  I can use it while it is charging.Also, it is washable.I just bought another one for my brother.</li>
    <li> Apologies for the all-caps, but this is a really important point.  Unless you want to buy a trimmer with someone else&#x27;s hair still in it, like I did, do not buy this item, and you may want to avoid Amazon altogether for this purchase.  I don&#x27;t even want to touch this thing to box it back up for the return.  I&#x27;m trying not to think about what body parts were trimmed with it, or by whom.  Absolutely disgusting behavior by Amazon... attempting to pass off a used item as new, especially one like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat emptor!</li>
    <li> Cons: Feels cheap and plasticy, quite noisy, and battery isn&#x27;t great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Reasonable price, blades and attachments work well and fit well.</li>
    <li> Got this for Fathers day. Used once so far. Works great.</li>
    <li> My husband says it shaves fine but there is not a whisker catcher! Who makes a man&#x27;s shaver without that??</li>
    <li> Good kit for men&#x27;s grooming, it&#x27;s very practical</li>
    <li> Great item and great seller</li>
    <li> Good trimmer overall .I have had mine for several months now (maybe a year??) and all the attachments cut very well.  It is really nice to have so many options at your disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that the attachments rattle loose.  They haven&#x27;t fallen off or anything but after the unit started making more noise and seemed loud, I figured out that some attachments were not sitting &amp;#34;tight and flush&amp;#34; against the main unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> Multiple uses, great in the shower, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. It really feels good in my hand, and I can tell the product is made of quality material. Can&#x27;t ask for more -- especially at the low price.</li>
    <li> Works great. No complains so far</li>
    <li> Really good trimmer.  The battery life and ability to run off of charger is great.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is the way you adjust the length on the beard trimmer is a little frustrating and flimsy. I&#x27;m surprised no one else mentioned this in their review. You have to push down on a small plastic piece to unlock then push up or down until it locks into a notch at the correct size. Mine feels stuck from time to time and I will push too far as a result. It does not seem like a durable system either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it has a lithium battery, trims well, and a waterproof head which are all great.</li>
    <li> With an above 4 star rating I took a chance on this trimmer. I am sorely disappointed. I replaced an old Remington that finally gave out due to the unavoidable lifespan of a rechargeable battery. I used this Norelco once and I already miss my Remington. This Norelco provided a very uneven trim length to my beard. The length of trim varies significantly with just a slight change in the angle in which you hold the trimmer to your shaving surface. In addition to the issue of uneven trimming, I also had to go over the same areas over and over again to get everything. Extremely inefficient and with so many passes there is greater chance for uneven trimming. Finally, the trim length selector feels cheap and does not switch smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not compare to my old Remington. The Remington cut evenly no matter what, it cut efficiently with far fewer passes, and it had a trim length wheel selector that operated smoothly and was easy to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying this was a mistake. Boy do I miss my old trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now. I would not call this a definitive rating, but so far the motor has worked well, the selection of blades is great and they work well. The masks aren&#x27;t as good as my old Braun, but after a couple of uses you get the handle and they do their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this.</li>
    <li> The accessories and the storage tray is absolutely cheap. The trimmer it self is solid. Just got it yesterday so will see how it performs over a period of time. Philips Norelco is loosing their edge.I have their sonic tooth brush and it died in less than 2 years. Hope the trimmer lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Good product. But you need some time to actually know how to use some of the trimers in the exact ways you wanted.</li>
    <li> perfect it&#x27;s include every things you will ever need.</li>
    <li> Nice idea, but this thing doesn&#x27;t last worth a flip.  I&#x27;ve had it just over a year.  One user, at home, normal usage, and the interchangeable heads will no longer stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a design flaw. I remember thinking when I bought this thing that the way the heads fit on didn&#x27;t seem durable.  Yep, I was right.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good device you&#x27;ll need to have it</li>
    <li> Posting under my Wife&#x27;s name. I was very impressed by this shaver, i&#x27;m new to beard shavers but not new to beards. I&#x27;ve always used either a hair trimmer or scissors to cut my beard, the result was always a longer beard. I did some research and just wanted something basic that had a battery and would also run with a cord. I was very surprised at the precision this shaver has, and it also shaves rather close to the skin with the right adapter. I cut inches off my beard and shaped it within 5 minutes and my wife said, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve never seen it so perfect&amp;#34;. So, if my wife likes it, I like it. It doesn&#x27;t have the frills the high dollar shavers have and its design is basic, though isn&#x27;t that all one needs. The only con I have is that there is nothing to hold all the adapters and shaver. This doesn&#x27;t come with any kind of stand so I doubt anyone will get away storing it on the bathroom sink. It most likely will be in a drawer. That&#x27;s why I gave it Four stars instead of 5</li>
    <li> All kinds of adapters.</li>
    <li> Like the packaging ,Works well overall.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Been using is solid for almost 2 months now, and it keeps getting better. I dinged it a star because it&#x27;s primarily plastic and feels like it&#x27;ll break if dropped. Other than that, this is a great trimmer. It comes with plenty of attachments and charges super quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great and best price I could find</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad&#x27;s birthday as he asked for an updated Head-to-Toe groomer. In his words, this was Perfect and just what he wanted.</li>
    <li> Several settings, charges fast and maintains charge!</li>
    <li> Does the job very well. Awesome</li>
    <li> Lovely product. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. For me, who likes having a descent size beard length but occasionally trims, the variety of lengths are excellent. The reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it makes alot of noise...trims well, but there is just a semi-loud noise. It isn&#x27;t loud enough to return but I just want to let future customers know that it is kinda noisy.</li>
    <li> I had a cordless trimmer for years, and even though it was beat up I just kept using it until one day I knocked it into the toilet.  The water was clean, but apparently the trimmer didn&#x27;t want to take a bath, and it never worked again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this one.  It is better in almost every way than my old one - it&#x27;s powerful, quiet and cuts the hair easily.  The nose hair trimmer is superb - no pulling at all.  One tiny complaint is that the adjustable guards are not as easy to change as the old one, and I do use it a lot with no guard on it (I shave my head).  But the heads themselves are very easy to change - I spent a minute pulling trying to get the thing off (I don&#x27;t read instructions), and then discovered that you have to twist to swap them.  It is a very clever and easy to use system for swapping the heads (trimmer, nose trimmer, etc.).  And I think this thing is even waterproof, so if I drop it in the toilet it should still work - bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have one complaint that prevented me from giving this 5 stars - the stupid power button is exactly where your thumb needs to be to use it!  So, while you&#x27;re happily shaving your head or beard, you turn the thing off by accident over and over, no matter how careful you try to be!  Grrr....  It&#x27;s like the Industrial Designer responsible for the button placement never actually used the thing, or else he or she was a sadistic jerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it is great, but I wish I could move the power button.</li>
    <li> Fantastic trimmer. Versatile. Handles all trimming needs, one tool to do it all. Long battery life between charging. Great, a must have for good grooming.</li>
    <li> This was purchased to replace another Norelco unit that I have been using for over 5 years.  The old one was a cheaper set with similar functions/abilities.  My reason for replacing it was the old unit was starting to lose some performance.  It still works and I&#x27;ll be moving that to my travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;  This new set is of a lot higher build quality than my original one and performs great, better than my original did when it was new.</li>
    <li> Met all of my expectations. Also have been using the unit without the cord for three weeks times twice a week,  without having to recharge. I am using mine to trim and maintain my mustache.</li>
    <li> The attachment locking mechanism wore out after 6 months. Now the beard trimmer is useless, because no attachments will stay in place. I like the beard trimmer&#x27;s Lithium battery, but I think Norelco&#x27;s previous designs for beard trimmers were better. This beard trimmer does a good job, but Norelco used cheap plastic on the trimmer and attachments, that grind down (from twisting on and off) after only 6 months of use. On average, I only trim twice a week, so I only got around 56 trims out of this trimmer. I will note that I used 3 different attachments for trimming and shaving, to get a clean short cut.  I should also mention that Norelco has agreed to send me a replacement beard trimmer under the unit&#x27;s 2-year warranty. I hope that they changed the quality of plastic, so that this is not an issue in another 6 months.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and good buy my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping everything trimmed. I mean everything</li>
    <li> Good product, I like the Amazon, this is one of my regular meeting site</li>
    <li> its good...easy to use.charge is easy.i loved it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough for a proper rating. However, product seems good and this transaction went well.</li>
    <li> klasnaia udobnaia ne wumnoia</li>
    <li> This Norelco Muligroom Beard Trimmer is a very high quality unit the comes with many features and accessories. The unit is well made and I expect many years of trouble free service from it.</li>
    <li> Good pricing and function</li>
    <li> Good quality and Worth the price...</li>
    <li> great product, good price</li>
    <li> This trimmer was a Christmas present to replace an outdated Norelco beard trimmer whose battery had gone kaput. It operates quite differently from my old one: it has interchangeable guards, blades, and trimmers, and a lithium-ion battery, which lasts much longer than the ni-cad one on my old trimmer. Learning which of the accessories were best for my tastes took some time; I have a &#x27;connected goatee&#x27;, which I keep closely trimmed and away from my upper lip. I use the full guard on the &#x27;3&#x27; depth setting, which works just fine. I set it on &#x27;5&#x27; for my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about my new Philips Norelco is the fact that it has no vacuum to suck up trimmings. My old one did a great job at this, but I have to make sure I keep my face over the sink with this one, or the clippings go all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this trimmer, but buyers should be patient in learning to use the accessories properly to get maximum benefit.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for less price</li>
    <li> Performed exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> a devolution from its predecessor.  basically not as good as the previous model, which was a simple, intuitive, sturdy, and effective set of trimmers/clippers that have lasted me for years.  this new model is overly complicated as far as replacing heads, feels cheaply made (with adhesive goop in various attachments as one reviewer showed in pics), and doesn&#x27;t feel as powerful even with its &#x27;turbo&#x27; function.  did not cut my beard close enough.</li>
    <li> for the price, an exceptional grooming tool. got this for my 18 year old son who is very picky.  replaced a panasonic unit that replaced some other &amp;#34;drug store brand&amp;#34; unit.  he&#x27;s really happy with this groomer and appreciates all of the tools that come with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m comparing this trimmer to a $20 Connair I bought in a local pharmacy when I decided to grow a beard. I had that one for around 8 years before I decided to treat myself to an &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34;. The Norelco was spectacular for the first 6 months I owned it. After that the attachments stopped seating tightly. This is a basic design flaw with the item. Each of the attachment heads are held on by friction. As the seat where they go wears over the months, some due to putting them on and removing them for cleaning and partly due to the vibration when the trimmer is in use, they start to get very very loose. At this point when I turn on the trimmer the heads rotate off center by about 30 degrees. This isn&#x27;t a huge problem for the shaving head but if you&#x27;re planning on using the trimmer with the hair guide this means that the trimmer can not be parallel to the guide and won&#x27;t give you an even trim.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tested it fully, however nose trimmer does almost nothing compared to Remington cheap trimmer I had before. All the heads and combs are uncomfortable to save. Material feels cheap. ---------------------- UPDATE: I cut my beard and head once every week. This trimmer has been my default trimmer for about last 18 months due to its power and sharp blade - the boost option with the the full sized metal trimmer was very nice for my thick hair. I&#x27;ve been using the full sized metal trimmer only, mostly with boost option on, without any length combs. If I wanted different length and used comb, I had to stop and remove the comb every 5-10 seconds to clean it from hair stuck in there. So mostly I had to go with zero length.  After couple of months, the full sized trimmer&#x27;s lower part, that fixes it to the tool, started to wear (mostly due to vibration probably), become loose and the trimmer began to sound like an industrial perforator. Now, its sound is reaching 80-90db (in 5cm distance) and has a very strong vibration, what makes the tool almost useless due to the feeling like you are holding an industrial perforator in your hands.  So, this trimmer is very good (also the battery is very good even after almost 2 years) if you have thick hair, want zero length cut with full sized trimmer attachment only and use it occasionally. Even otherwise, I would not say total waste of money due to its low price (I paid $29.95).</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price. -1 for, little battery issues. I am not sure its just me or for everyone, battery goes out very quickly.</li>
    <li> Do explain why you liked or disliked it.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products or services and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;m not exaggerating. I&#x27;ve tried Walh (It was too harsh on the skin and needed excessive back and forth trimming on the same area). I&#x27;ve tried Conair (poor battery but okay trimming). I&#x27;ve tried Braun (expensive and is totally ineffective). Then, after a friend had used one of these Philips, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since he recommended it. It is amazing because it cuts the hair easily on the first trim and is painless and easy on the skin. The battery is awesome. I haven&#x27;t tried the clippers, but I know they&#x27;ll be good, too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very good , it&#x27;s really an all in one machine</li>
    <li> The trimmer is worth its $30 price, but nothing more. The construction seems flimsy, it vibrates and is noisy compared with quality trimmers. It works, however, and the attachments are complete. If I were buying again, I would add a few dollars and get a Wahl or a quality Andis; their quality advantage shows.</li>
    <li> it works fine but you need to know how to work with it</li>
    <li> Seemed like a good buy when it arrived.  It quit working 1 day after the 30 day return period.  I thought it was a quality product since its a Norelco.  Maybe I got the lemon - but I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on that chance!</li>
    <li> Works very well.  The turbo mode is most useful for the nose-hair trimmer function, but every function I&#x27;ve used on it has been fantastic.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews in which people say that the guards are very difficult to put on and adjust, and I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case.  Just read the instructions and follow the diagrams and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and haven&#x27;t had to charge it again, so the battery holds a high charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> it does the job. I wish the packaging wood fit on a narrow 2 1/2 in shelf.</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself is good quality and cuts smoothly.  Holds a charge for a long time.  I don&#x27;t like the cheap plastic guards and how they attach to the trimmer.  I think Phillips could have found a more sturdy, better way to attach guards.</li>
    <li> My husband got this as a Christmas gift - so far he is very happy! He says it shaves and trims nicely, holds a good charge.</li>
    <li> Great! would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Good electric shaver. Does what i need it to and then some.</li>
    <li> I saw the price that was 29 dollar but they charge me 37 funny that it still apear 29&lt;br /&gt;after order I tried but I didn&#x27;t work. I completely confused. but at least they helped me to resend. but the price issue is still strange!</li>
    <li> Worked great in the beginning, but after about a year the main head became really loose. now whenever turned on the main head just falls off.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Its easy to use, and I can detail really easy. I&#x27;ve only use it on my facial hair, so not sure about the hair comb,</li>
    <li> Everything you need for trimming.</li>
    <li> good quality, works as expected )</li>
    <li> Super tool, I&#x27;ve bought several trimmers and thrown them away for one reason or another.  However, this one is a real winner!  Can trim hair and beard anyway I want with great accuracy and detail.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product to buy and will work as advertised</li>
    <li> works good  a little to small  for me</li>
    <li> For a trimmer it lacks a variety of blades for the beard. I have only charged it once since I got it, which is good. The machine is strong though and it has a turbo mode but you have to ask yourself, why is this not the standard mode. Feels like a gimmick they added.</li>
    <li> There are no major problems for this trimmer.  Yes the case is cheap and there is white lubricant inside the shaver body  which lubricates all head gears when using a particular head but this does not interfere with the trimmer blades and they all do a very good job of the specific functions they are suppose to do.  You are not going to get a better trimmer at the price.</li>
    <li> works well, would like to have a substantial holder</li>
    <li> Good: Shape and feel. Easy to see what you are doing. Blades are enclosed so there&#x27;s less mess.&lt;br /&gt;Bad: It doesn&#x27;t have enough power to trim evenly or even well. The turbo button is a joke. It&#x27;s under powered with it on, why turn it off?&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Definetly not a good buy. For me, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Very sharp. Does a great job. Will see how it lasts.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer. Seems well built. 2 year warranty but if you register online they extend it to 5 years at no charge. One hour charging gives you 1 hour of run time....can also be used corded if battery dies out before you finish. Gets my 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> good  price,good service and nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> The QG3364/42 has been an excellent grooming tool for my bathroom.  The multiple heads take care of any and all shaving or grooming needs that I may have.  It is wonderful to replace an old groomer with this model that has metal clippers and a turbo mode to ensure that each and every hair that comes in the path of this trimmer is taken care of with the precision and expertise that you expect.  Philips has never let me down in the past with their personal grooming products, and this trimmer is no exception.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband to trim his beard and shave his head.  He likes it.  We don&#x27;t see the use for the ones with more heads.  I&#x27;m sure there is a use, but not for him.</li>
    <li> This thing sucks.  I&#x27;ve used the rechargeable norelco for over a decade and love the grip and design and function but finally the blades and batteries wore out. My ideal replacement would be identical only with lithium battery.  Since that doesn&#x27;t exist I bought this piece of junk and am extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off the blade attaches backwards for all but one arrangement.  This means the thing feels all wrong in your hand when trying to trim the back of neck or around ears or nose. It&#x27;s ergonomically incorrect.  The only blade that fits normal is not designed for neck or delicate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So,  next issue is that the guard attachments are also wrong.  They just flat suck and don&#x27;t make sense and are not accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this unit - the designers should be fired.  Failed attempt at anything decent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the product description. Small, light and with several accessories for different styles and lengths. Came with the charger and last long enough for two uses for what I have seen. Comes with a plastic casing makes it easy to store and keep organized. I likely look to Norelco again when I go to buy the next one.</li>
    <li> does the job the way it should</li>
    <li> Expected better qualiy</li>
    <li> Much better than the remington ones you get at Macy&#x27;s. Have only used it twice in last 3 months and so far it has worked great</li>
    <li> Not what I had hoped at all.  The turbo function is barely noticeable</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use.  My husband was really happy with it, as I with the timely arrival, just in time for Christmas as promised.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! Between this and my Goatee saver my Goatee and sideburns look great. Trims evenly and powerfully, and has a Li-ion battery for long life.  Very pleased</li>
    <li> I thought it came with a different blade for body hair and facial hair, but not really. Now I just use the main beard trimming blade for both and switch out the plastic guide. The other blades are useless to me, except maybe the nose trimmer. Not ideal to use the same blade on face and body for functionality, reliability, and sanitary reasons, but it&#x27;s ok for a multigroom overall</li>
    <li> I owned previous model of philips norelco which I lost. So I decided to go with this product. As expected a high quality product. No complaints. Battery charge time exceptional. No cuts with blades and prefer Norelco over other companies !</li>
    <li> Nice quality. I bought this to replace a cheaper trimmer I&#x27;ve had for almost 10 years. It works very well on facial and body hair. The rounded head eliminates a lot of discomfort. Seems to hold a charge pretty well. I really wish it came with a stand, though.</li>
    <li> Kinda bulky. ..but ok</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few months now.  No issues.  Works well as expected</li>
    <li> Best trimmer with lots of options. Used for beard and mustache, and I like the different adjustments.</li>
