      <li>I ended up giving it away to my impoverished college kid, who will use anything to save spending money. :-)</li>
      <li>I like crest more than Colgate.</li>
      <li>I love he mint gel.</li>
      <li>This is not gritty but a wonderful combination of approved ingredients for your teeth&#x27;s health!</li>
      <li>These are currently Colgate&#x27;s best toothpaste and well deserved.</li>
      <li>I feel it cleans my mouth much better than Crest whitening toothpaste.</li>
      <li>For more information on triclosan, refer to the EPA website.</li>
      <li>Please educate yourselves on the chemical \\&quot;Triclosan\\&quot; found in this product and many others.</li>
      <li>one packs a punch, the moment you start brushing, you can feel the freshness effects, and it lasts for an hour or more, even after eating some foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to write more words about it</li>
      <li>I love being able to have this delivered on autoship.</li>
      <li>I love them..</li>
      <li>I love the way it foams in your mouth</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>But, my teeth feel SO clean all day!</li>
      <li>I think this is a good toothpaste but can&#x27;t say how much it helps with whitening as I drink a lot of coffee.</li>
      <li>Love the clean feeling afterwards.</li>
      <li>A bit strong tasting</li>
      <li>Colgate Total Advanced Fresh is an excellent toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My Dental hygienist is always very happy with my teeth because there&#x27;s a lot less work for her to do.</li>
      <li>great price and delivery time on basic product</li>
      <li>Good but crest 3D white is much better</li>
      <li>The toothpaste leaves a great freshness after brushing which lasts long... .</li>
      <li>(this is Colgate Total Advanced Fresh + Whitening), but still a great toothpaste anyway.</li>
      <li>It makes my teeth and mouth feel clean.</li>
      <li>Even rinsing with cool water after brushing caused that &amp;#34;icy burn&amp;#34; feeling, prompting me to reactively spit out.</li>
      <li>Love all the Colgate products this is a real hit.</li>
      <li>This was reported to have the special chemical that could cause defect baby, DO NOT USE IF YOU ARE PREGNANT</li>
      <li>like the lid on this tube, its a flip top - easy to open and easy to keep</li>
      <li>This powerful brand of teeth cleaning leaves your mouth fresh and minty for hours!</li>
      <li>I love most Colgate toothpastes, but this product is simply meh.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really freshening, and will leave you will fresh breath for many hours.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a mild flavor, this is NOT it.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste could be a little strong for some, but the fresh feeling is pretty great.</li>
      <li>certainly worth it.</li>
      <li>It also keeps your breath fresh just like they advertised.</li>
      <li>It is worth the price.</li>
      <li>It keeps your breath fresh for 24 hours.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always surprised that there has not been more promotion of it.  </li>
      <li>I use this with my Sonicare Healthy White and my teeth feel smooth and polished.</li>
      <li>Colgate is one of the leading toothpaste company&#x27;s that has proven its self worth over the ages.</li>
      <li>However, I tried a sample of this specific toothpaste and my teeth feel so clean I love it.</li>
      <li>I usually use crest but saw this deal and tried it, very happy and TOTAL Advanced sold me too.</li>
      <li>Gentle, mild flavor.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad to help and American company succeed.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find the cleaning to be any better than the regular stuff either</li>
      <li>combine this with Sonicare Healthy White, Crest Pro Health, and a tongue scrapper (along with floss at night).</li>
      <li>This is the only toothpaste my husband will use!:)</li>
      <li>I like it better than the paste total.</li>
      <li>Personally, I have had better results with sensitivity and whitening using crest products.</li>
      <li>Totally wakes me up in the morning and makes my mouth feel very clean at night.  </li>
      <li>This is a bit lighter than the advanced whitening toothpaste but still pretty heavy and the aftertaste feels more like \\&quot;burning\\&quot; than \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;.  </li>

    <li> Good toothpaste. Cleans well and tastes good</li>
    <li> Excellent,  exceeded my expectations. Love the clean feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> my teeth never felt so clean!!!</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s what my dentist recommends.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing. I feel it cleans my mouth much better than Crest whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected - fresh &amp; minty, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;I like the lid on this tube, its a flip top - easy to open and easy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;tooth fairy approved!</li>
    <li> Happy with the product, arrived promptly</li>
    <li> I actually like the regular Colgate Total Whitening better than this (this is Colgate Total Advanced Fresh + Whitening), but still a great toothpaste anyway. Gentle, mild flavor.  Doesn&#x27;t seem too abrasive or anything.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any increased sensitivity in my teeth or anything like that.</li>
    <li> Love it! It makes my teeth and mouth feel clean.</li>
    <li> A whitening toothpaste with the ADA approval that doesn&#x27;t cost $15/tube!?  YES!  We&#x27;ve gone through one tube of this so I think it&#x27;s fair to review it now.  This stuff leaves my entire mouth feeling cleaner than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!  It&#x27;s SUPER cool/minty (or, &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re my 7 year old).  If you&#x27;re looking for a mild flavor, this is NOT it.  It will &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; your entire face!  LOL  But, my teeth feel SO clean all day!</li>
    <li> eeeeeee teeth are white.. awesome. Looking for this in the stores and amazon beats the price and offers the best product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cannot be happier</li>
    <li> good taste and not overpowering</li>
    <li> Who wants to run out of toothpaste?  I love being able to have this delivered on autoship.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, arrived on time and in great condition! One of my favorite brands I can get in bulk? What is there not to like? There are other Colgate types but this one suits my needs and I can&#x27;t complain about that.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste is toothpaste.  But this is Made in America and I&#x27;m glad to help and American company succeed.  The gel is pleasant tasting and seems to whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> Yes, the ingredients list isn&#x27;t 100% safe.  But don&#x27;t pick on this toothpaste.  Especially when you&#x27;re brushing cold cuts out of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got lots of marketing on the front, it&#x27;s advanced, it&#x27;s extra minty.  It&#x27;s toothpaste in a more expensive box.</li>
    <li> I like crest more than Colgate. Personally, I have had better results with sensitivity and whitening using crest products. I also didn&#x27;t care for the taste of this product.</li>
    <li> great price and delivery time on basic product</li>
    <li> Good packaging and genuine Colgate toothpaste.. I love them..The toothpaste leaves a great freshness after brushing which lasts long... .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste how much can you say about toothpaste.  It does what it says, tastes good and comes in a convenient size.</li>
    <li> It serves it purpose.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tooth paste.  You put it on your tooth brush.  Then you brush.</li>
    <li> I love he mint gel. That is the reason I buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I have to write such a long and long review about the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt; I have my choice to choose and buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time you ask me to give the stars.  I will delete the review from now on.</li>
    <li> Got what I wanted!  Got what I wanted!  Got what I wanted .  I don&#x27;t want to write more words about it</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste on the market, period. No other toothpaste protects your mouth for 12 hours to my knowledge. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Burns like fire every time I brush.  Hate this stuff and will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> Recommended by Dental Hygienist -  Good tasting, effective cleaning gel at reasonable price through Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save Program!</li>
    <li> Really makes my mouth feel fresh and clean for a long time. I usually use crest but saw this deal and tried it, very happy and TOTAL Advanced sold me too.</li>
    <li> Good but crest 3D white is much better</li>
    <li> I thought I would not like green toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m even convinced that it will challenge even the most expensive toothpastes out there, like Amway&#x27;s toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t have pumice or anything to harm the enamel. Just feel how gritty your toothpaste is - even check your Crest! This is not gritty but a wonderful combination of approved ingredients for your teeth&#x27;s health!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste you will ever use.  I&#x27;m always surprised that there has not been more promotion of it.  I have been using it for years now.  It is sometimes hard to find now, and some stores don&#x27;t carry it, which is why I looked on Amazon.  It&#x27;s really freshening, and will leave you will fresh breath for many hours.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well and seems to whiten my teeth. I can&#x27;t seem to use a whitening gel and the stuff my dentist gave me made my hurt (lots of pain from it) so this helps although I don&#x27;t know that it does as good a job as a dental whitening gel but it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
    <li> All of us have different brushing needs or none at all.  We have been Colgate users for decades and see little reason to change.  A good oral hygiene program includes Total and some of the other tooth tools, but the Gel is the mainstay in our routine.  I cannot prove Total&#x27;s effectiveness at reducing tooth decay; however, it has been several years since either of us has had any problems.</li>
    <li> this toothpaste makes my breath fresh for a long time!! love it!!</li>
    <li> Solid toothpaste for the cost.</li>
    <li> I love most Colgate toothpastes, but this product is simply meh. The consistency of the toothpaste remains basically the same after brushing my teeth, it doesn&#x27;t foam up and there&#x27;s barely any taste of freshness once done. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> This was reported to have the special chemical that could cause defect baby, DO NOT USE IF YOU ARE PREGNANT</li>
    <li> I used this toothpaste for about a month and went for a dental appointment and the dentist did note that my teeth and gum look good.</li>
    <li> Its just toothpaste, but its my favorite kind</li>
    <li> As a Dental Hygienist I always loved Crest. However, I tried a sample of this specific toothpaste and my teeth feel so clean I love it. Will never look back.</li>
    <li> These are currently Colgate&#x27;s best toothpaste and well deserved. The whitening effects are probably the best in all the toothpaste I&#x27;ve used. You can see results in a week with daily brushing.</li>
    <li> Best Colgate whitening effect yet. After only a few weeks I have noticed a difference. New household favourite.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste my husband will use!:)</li>
    <li> This is the harshest toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. For the record, I have a great tolerance for spicy foods so I don&#x27;t think this is just an issue of a sensitive mouth. Even rinsing with cool water after brushing caused that &amp;#34;icy burn&amp;#34; feeling, prompting me to reactively spit out. Once (and just once) I tried talking with my mouth still full of toothpaste (a feat totally doable with other pastes) and some of this touched the back of my throat. No joke, the rest of my day was borderline ruined. It was so uncomfortable -- my nose wouldn&#x27;t stop running and it felt like my tonsils had swollen up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for about a week and then got something else. What&#x27;s worse is that I didn&#x27;t notice any sort of increased whitening effect from what I get with other Colgate products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> The little one loves this and won&#x27;t let me use and doesn&#x27;t want to switch.  Keeping cavities as well as stains at bay.</li>
    <li> I have found it! This is the toothpaste that I will use and really can&#x27;t imagine finding a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one packs a punch, the moment you start brushing, you can feel the freshness effects, and it lasts for an hour or more, even after eating some foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I combine this with Sonicare Healthy White, Crest Pro Health, and a tongue scrapper (along with floss at night). Even with that whole combination, I don&#x27;t think my breath has been so under control till I started with this paste.</li>
    <li> Cost effective way to purchase our toothpaste.  Good Value.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste - Its a very strong flavor.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste could be a little strong for some, but the fresh feeling is pretty great.</li>
    <li> this used to be the toothpaste to buy but it contains a carcinogen (triclosan) so I would recommend switching to another product that does not contain this.  I switched to Tom&#x27;s which has only natural ingredients, including fluoride, and sodium bicarb to raise the pH.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised ,came on time ,and you get two for a great price .Will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Please educate yourselves on the chemical \\&quot;Triclosan\\&quot; found in this product and many others. Triclosan is a known endocrine disruptor and is considered toxic. This chemical is currently being considered for ban in the U.S. and is banned in several other countries. It may work, but you have no idea what it is doing to your body and it is harmful to the environment. Some healthier alternatives would be Australian tea tree oil, grapefruit seed extract, and pine oil. For more information on triclosan, refer to the EPA website.</li>
    <li> I get this thru amazon because I have a hard time finding it locally and I don&#x27;t want to make a career of looking for toothpaste in stores. My dentist recommended it, and for some dumb reason I have a hard time finding the gel style  which I prefer over the paste (yuk).</li>
    <li> Good tasting toothpaste, cleans well. Reasonable cost with subscribe and save option.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Sonicare Healthy White and my teeth feel smooth and polished. It does have kick and is stronger than any other toothpaste I have used. But I need that....together with a waterpik ultra, tongue scrapper, and my prescription mouthwash perio guard....I have fresher breath.</li>
    <li> A bit strong tasting but does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I have always been happy with colgate purchasing it on Amazon saves some money.  Will recommend and continue to use.</li>
    <li> Everyone has a different criteria for what they look for in a toothpaste.  This toothpaste satisfies both for my husband and I.  It is nice to be able to buy one brand and and get a bargain too!! I love the way it foams in your mouth and you can feel it working. Best toothpaste for me!!</li>
    <li> Not too minty.  I like the gel.</li>
    <li> Colgate is one of the leading toothpaste company&#x27;s that has proven its self worth over the ages. However, they have out down themselves with the Colgate Total Advanced Fresh Whitening Gel Toothpaste. It works well. It brightens you teeth in a matter of days. It keeps your breath fresh for 24 hours. I will buy it again. It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappinted by the lack of &amp;#34;foaming action&amp;#34; this toothpaste creates. I like to feel like my mouth is getting scrubbed. The taste is more like mouthwash and less like cleansing toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is so refreshing!  Totally wakes me up in the morning and makes my mouth feel very clean at night.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I generally use the regular total paste or gel because I find the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; branded stuff to be too heavy.  This is a bit lighter than the advanced whitening toothpaste but still pretty heavy and the aftertaste feels more like \\&quot;burning\\&quot; than \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;.  I only bought it at retail because of coupons (ironically from a package of the regular colgate total), I probably won&#x27;t buy it again versus the regular colgate total.  I didn&#x27;t find the cleaning to be any better than the regular stuff either, I&#x27;m just going to stick with that.  Similar consistency/appearance to crest pro health (oddly) without the grit.</li>
    <li> Good paste, makes your mouth feel clean for a good amount of time, even after eating.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. Combined with the Oral-B Cross-action brush, It seems to get my toofies cleaner than anything else. I think it has some kind of anti-bacterial in it, and it&#x27;s got a little zing to it, but not a problem and certainly worth it. My Dental hygienist is always very happy with my teeth because there&#x27;s a lot less work for her to do. And now, my teeth don&#x27;t even feel that much different after the cleaning! Which is amazing. With products like this and sealants, Dentistry may be a dying profession!</li>
    <li> Product was as shown and what I wanted. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good toothpaste but can&#x27;t say how much it helps with whitening as I drink a lot of coffee. I do like the flavor and texture and it works well with my electric oscillating toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Yikes!!! This was so much more spicy than I expected! I ended up giving it away to my impoverished college kid, who will use anything to save spending money. :-)</li>
    <li> This powerful brand of teeth cleaning leaves your mouth fresh and minty for hours!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I actually had an issue with tooth sensitivity, when using some other whitening toothpastes, but this one does not do that and cleans/tastes well.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and have always preferred this product</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste on the market today as far as I am concerned! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I much prefer colgate to any other toothpaste brand. I am happy with this product as it seems to clean well and leaves your mouth refreshed. I can&#x27;t say I notice a difference with the whitening part of it. I did notice that with the gel as opposed to the paste, it seems to harden a lot quicker. I hate when the opening is stuck with hardened toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I like it better than the paste total. It seems stronger and longer lasting. I will keep this as my toothpaste as long as they continue to make it.</li>
    <li> Best of the best. This Colgate leaves clean, long lasting freshness to you mouth. Love all the Colgate products this is a real hit.</li>
    <li> Colgate Total Advanced Fresh is an excellent toothpaste. It also keeps your breath fresh just like they advertised. It is hard to find so I am so glad Amazon carries this product.</li>
    <li> This tooth paste must have been stored in a very cold warehouse for a very long time.. It is just like rubber and you can&#x27;t get it out of the tube. What a waste of money. Never again, I&#x27;ll buy of the shelf in a store.</li>
    <li> Not so great, it&#x27;s overwhelmingly minty, and it makes my gums tingle in an I&#x27;m allergic to this toothpaste kind of way. I think this just has too much flavor, I&#x27;m going back to my boring flavorless paste.</li>
