      <li>i love this product but it is not working--</li>
      <li>I Love Mastey products.</li>

      <li>What I love about Frehair is it leaves not residue on your hair.</li>
      <li>The results are the most important part, and it just didn&#x27;t bring it.  </li>
      <li>I have not been able to have great hair on the 2nd day without rewashing!!</li>

      <li>, it&#x27;s gentle but effective at cleaning.  </li>

      <li>and that is most likely the problem-  </li>

      <li>Improved my tangles, but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>I have very long hair which tangles easily.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because I&#x27;m not throwing it away -- just letting my less picky household consumers use it up. :)</li>
      <li>so I wish it worked a little better</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the only product I can use without taking a shampoo/conditioner &amp;#34;vacation.&amp;#34; I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is light yet keeps the frizzies down.</li>
      <li>They always leave my hair soft and don&#x27;t hurt my color.</li>
      <li>People always comment on how much shine and body my hair has, and this is definitely one of the reasons why.</li>
      <li>This product is perfect for any type of hair, curly or straight, thick or thin!</li>
      <li>Wanted a quick, every day, oil-free product that made my hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>I have long, wavy hair, and this keeps it soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years, it&#x27;s the only brand that actually detangles my thin hair without damage and helps with static in the winter</li>

<li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t de-tangling like it used to because the pump distribution was uneven, but since getting a new bottle and filling two smaller bottles with it, it&#x27;s still thin and not working.</li>
<li> My hair felt really dry this winter.</li>
<li> Made my hair very dry and brittle.</li>
<li> i recommend for everyone to give their hair a break from bad styling products and habits, use this shampoo and conditioner and your hair will feel soo much better with almost immediate results</li>
<li> It&#x27;s now joined the collection of other hair products passed down to my husband and kids because they don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
<li> My hair still gets tangled when I use this product, but it is less.</li>
<li> and I still felt like it weighed my hair down!  </li>
<li> It cuts the combing out of my hair in at least half over other conditioners.</li>
<li> Usually people have to change their shampoo and conditioner every so often to prevent buildup or limp hair.</li>
<li> Will not use any other product after using this one!!!</li>
<li> I had a really hard time brushing my hair afterward</li>
<li> I have thin hair but lots of it.</li>
<li> I have oily hair and any conditioner made it worse.  </li>
<li> It is expensive though</li>
<li> /&gt;Update - 12/14 - I&#x27;m suspicious it&#x27;s not legit product - either it&#x27;s being adulterated or it&#x27;s fake.</li>
<li> I think there is fake product out there</li>

    <li> Made my hair very dry and brittle. It was also more tangled and frizzy than when I started using this product. Wont purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use both Mastey shampoo and the detangler, Frehair. I have use these products for over 15 years. I have oily hair and any conditioner made it worse.  What I love about Frehair is it leaves not residue on your hair. So it never made my hair oily.Traite and Frehair together make great hair care.      I have recommended these products to several people. They have all loved it.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! I have thin hair but lots of it. My hair gets really frizzy in humidity. This conditioner is light yet keeps the frizzies down. I have used this product for probably 20 years buying it special order from my stylist or ordering directly from the manufaturer. I am thrilled Amazon carries it now!</li>
    <li> I can use this and the next day my hair is not greasy!! Just soft and pretty! I have not been able to have great hair on the 2nd day without rewashing!!</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff and so does my household.. I have soo many good reviews for this product, leaves your hair super soft, healthy and full of volume! i recommend for everyone to give their hair a break from bad styling products and habits, use this shampoo and conditioner and your hair will feel soo much better with almost immediate results</li>
    <li> Improved my tangles, but not as much as I had hoped. My hair still gets tangled when I use this product, but it is less. Smells great and feels nice. I would still recommend this product. It is expensive though so I wish it worked a little better that is why I only put 4 stars. I have to use a leave in detangler as well as this in order to get my tangles out.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair care product I have ever used.  It actually DOES help your hair look, feel and handle better.  No drying, no itchy scalp, it&#x27;s gentle but effective at cleaning.  Will not use any other product after using this one!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this conditioner.  It&#x27;s now joined the collection of other hair products passed down to my husband and kids because they don&#x27;t work for me.  About my hair: I have fine, wavy, color processed hair.  It&#x27;s really important that my conditioner is conditioning enough to allow me to brush out the tangles (my fine hair tangles very easily!), but rinses out enough to keep my hair light and easily styled without weighing it down.  From the scent, to the consistency, to the results, I did not like this stuff.  The scent is overwhelming.  The consistency feels like cheap 99c store conditioner.  It&#x27;s milky and feels cheap if that means anything!  The results are the most important part, and it just didn&#x27;t bring it.  I had a really hard time brushing my hair afterward and I still felt like it weighed my hair down!  Go figure!  I would not buy this again.  I guess I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because I&#x27;m not throwing it away -- just letting my less picky household consumers use it up. :)</li>
    <li> I Love Mastey products. They always leave my hair soft and don&#x27;t hurt my color. The smell of coconuts is a definite bonus.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used to condition my hair, been using it for about 15 years, would rather fight than switch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I&#x27;ll never use anything else unless I can no longer have it available to me.</li>
    <li> Have used this for ages - best detangler. I have long, wavy hair, and this keeps it soft and shiny. When I&#x27;ve ordered 32 oz Mastey products from Alkam (Prime shipping), they included the bottle pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 12/14 - I&#x27;m suspicious it&#x27;s not legit product - either it&#x27;s being adulterated or it&#x27;s fake. At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t de-tangling like it used to because the pump distribution was uneven, but since getting a new bottle and filling two smaller bottles with it, it&#x27;s still thin and not working. I&#x27;ve used this product from Marshalls when I used to find it, so I don&#x27;t think product age is a factor.</li>
    <li> My hair felt really dry this winter. Wanted a quick, every day, oil-free product that made my hair soft without weighing it down. This product is perfect for any type of hair, curly or straight, thick or thin!</li>
    <li> I have been using Mastey for 20+ years, it is absolutly the best detangler &amp; so worth the price.  It cuts the combing out of my hair in at least half over other conditioners.</li>
    <li> Usually people have to change their shampoo and conditioner every so often to prevent buildup or limp hair. I have not found this to be the case with Mastey. I&#x27;ve been a Mastey fan for 15+ years now and it&#x27;s the only product I can use without taking a shampoo/conditioner &amp;#34;vacation.&amp;#34; I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free, and a little goes a long way. People always comment on how much shine and body my hair has, and this is definitely one of the reasons why. This is one of my favorite beauty products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years, it&#x27;s the only brand that actually detangles my thin hair without damage and helps with static in the winter</li>
    <li> i love this product but it is not working-- I think there is fake product out there sometimes and that is most likely the problem-  will buy again from a different seller</li>
    <li> great conditioner...I love Mastey products!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very long hair which tangles easily. This leaves my hair free of tangles.</li>
