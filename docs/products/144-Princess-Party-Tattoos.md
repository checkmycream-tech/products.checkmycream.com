<li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving four stars instead of five is because they are just a little too big for a little girl&#x27;s (or boy&#x27;s) hand.</li>
<li> lasted less than 2 days</li>
<li> They are about the size of a half dollar.</li>
<li> Other temporary tattoos we have had in the past</li>
<li> a bit boring as there are only 6 different designs and the set has 144 tats...</li>
<li> Disappointed.  </li>

    <li> These made cute party favors for my 4-year-old&#x27;s princess party. They come in a big stack of individual tattoos with 24 of each of the six styles. The only reason I&#x27;m giving four stars instead of five is because they are just a little too big for a little girl&#x27;s (or boy&#x27;s) hand. They are sized more for an adult-sized hand, I think. Still, you get a large quantity for a low price. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Worked great. They were a hit!</li>
    <li> These tattoos look nice and my daughter loved them but they only last a day before washing off.  Other temporary tattoos we have had in the past last much longer.
