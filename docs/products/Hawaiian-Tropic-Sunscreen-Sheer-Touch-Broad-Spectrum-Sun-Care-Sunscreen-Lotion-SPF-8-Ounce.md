<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the smell of this sunscreen.  I also like that it goes on and feels like regular lotion.  What I don&#x27;t like is it comes off pretty easily.  It runs in my eyes when my face gets wet and rubs off without even knowing it.</li>
    <li> While the smell and packagine were great the product itself is the worst.currently in Punta Cana and my husband and my arms and backs are redder than last nights lobester.</li>
    <li> The first time I picked up a Hawaiian Tropic Sheer Sunblock, I was in Vegas.  I needed more sunblock (I didn&#x27;t bring enough unfortunately) so I stopped by the Walgreens on the Vegas Strip.  As I walked in, a couple of models were promoting this sunblock.  They were discounted and I had nothing to lose so I bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other sunblocks I was using, this one goes on smooth and there&#x27;s no greasy feel to it.  It&#x27;s like putting on moisturizing lotion.  The coconut(?) scent is nice too.  I&#x27;ve been using this sunblock ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this sunblock, and I really struggled to find one, is that because it goes on so smooth, sometimes I think I didn&#x27;t put enough on.  I end up using more, going through the bottle rather fast.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and at a great price</li>
    <li> I purchased a bottle of this sunscreen mostly for use while I&#x27;m doing yard work. I&#x27;m not accustomed to doing this type of work, nor spending lots of time in the sun. I have fair skin that burns easily, but this sunblock seems to work beautifully. I&#x27;ve spent hours out in the full sun without getting any sunburn. It seems to work just as well even after you get it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunblock itself is very creamy; definitely more like a regular lotion than a sunblock. It doesn&#x27;t leave me sticky or oily feeling, just smooth. No white residue. I&#x27;ve used it on my face without it causing breakouts. It has a coconut smell, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering like some sunblock lotions. It&#x27;s far more pleasant than the old sunblock lotions I remember using at the beach as a kid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with it is that it sometimes stains white fabrics. It only seems to happen when you get it wet. The inner lining of two of my swimsuits turned an orange color after using it. If you have a white swimsuit, you may want to use something else.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunscreen! Typically I hate wearing sunscreen because of the sunscreen-y smell, and that they leave my skin feeling greasy and damp all day.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen smells fantastic, feels like a regular lotion rather than a sunscreen with no greasy residue left on everything you might touch. It is gentle enough to use on your face and doesn&#x27;t taste horrible if you happen to get some on your lips.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT. Nice smell and matte without without being drying. Next buy I might try the SPF 50 version.</li>
    <li> The Hawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch (SPF30) has become my favorite sunblock.  I bought it based on a recommendation in Bicycling magazine, and also because it&#x27;s much cheaper than sunblocks with zinc oxide.  This is really the only sunblock I can stand to put on because of how light and non-greasy it is.  Other sunblocks have come close, but always cost twice as much or more.  It&#x27;s not rated very well on the EWG Skin Deep database (moderate health concerns), but I figure it&#x27;s healthier I get a sunblock I don&#x27;t mind using, than to get a sunblock I hate (or can&#x27;t afford) and not use as often.  It does have a very strong Pina Colada scent, but I don&#x27;t think it smells bad or chemically.  It does burn your eyes a little, so it might be worth pairing this with a separate face product, but I find washing my face after a workout works fine.</li>
    <li> good stuff, protects well, quick shipper</li>
    <li> As a blonde white girl who is the mom of 4 blonde kids and one ginger.... using this sunscreen is a must. It rubs in easily, smells great and helps prevent burns. I probably by 20 per year!</li>
    <li> I liked another Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen but this one did not have a pleasant smell. It is very bad smelling like an insect repellent, it smelled so bad I had to go wash it off my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product! i&#x27;ve never had any sunblock like this, i like the smell and the sheer touch.it&#x27;s not sticky at all.i used coppertone before,but since i have this i will never go back to coppertone anymore.love it!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best I&#x27;ve used so far. It has a nice scent, a light sparkle, and it blends in well. It protects from the sun really well as long you apply and reapply correctly.</li>
    <li> Best smelling sunscreen and not greasy feeling--plus protects well on fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;All that equals great sunscreen and a family favorite. I buy several bottles so we can all be applying at once.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion/sunscreen.  It&#x27;s hard to find a lotion with sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t smell funny, or like sunscreen.  I love the light scent (slightly tropical) and the glow it gives your skin.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> Not a greasy as most sunscreens and it hasn&#x27;t stained my clothing.  Very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is a week spot - it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get the last ounce out of this bottle.</li>
    <li> Got this sunblock  for my mom at Walmart and she really likes it has a nice smell wasn&#x27;t expensive and works great</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this sunscreen, works and smells great! It is a great value, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. First time I tired this I loved this stuff because I was just in minimal sun exposure. It smells great and feels so nice on the skin. However this is not what I would consider to be sunblock. I never get burnt and after spending a couple hours at the beach with this on I was a lobster. I think since it&#x27;s mixed with lotion it&#x27;s not very effective at blocking the sun rays. I will keep this for when I go to things like a cookout because it smells great, moisturizes, and I will be mostly covered in clothing.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen there is.  Even thought it&#x27;s SPF 30, it is not &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; like some are.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite sunscreen (for the body) and I&#x27;ve used a lot of different kinds, from high end department store brands (ie. Shiseido) to brands sold by my dermatologists (Elsa, La Roche Posay). As another reviewer mentioned, it&#x27;s light, non-chalky, and nice smelling. I love that it&#x27;s suppose to be nourishing and it is lightly moisturizing which makes it perfect for a day in the sun. The scent is unisex (I slather it on my fiancé all the time) and it&#x27;s in no way chemically or overpowering. I love it so much that I wish Hawaiian made one for the face too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I&#x27;ve seen this come in SPF30 and SPF50 and I&#x27;ve purchased and used both. They are pretty much identical in texture, etc. Not that many stores carry this so I usually stock up.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, reminds me of the beach.  This is the scent I remember from my childhood.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other sunscreens but Hawaiian Tropic is the only one that doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I put it on my face.  Whether it&#x27;s sweat, or water dripping down my face, or accidentally rubbing my eyes with my hand, I&#x27;ve had other lotions sting for hours (Coppertone is the worst for me).  This is just thick enough so that it doesn&#x27;t run when I put it on but also thin enough that I can rub it in easily.  And when I reapply every hour or so, I don&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> goes on smooth, no ghost face, no streaks, no crease settling.  not too shiny.  the smell is tropically AWESOME!  the only problem is it stings my face a little. :-(  i really wish it didn&#x27;t sting my face.  maybe i will just keep using it and hope that my face toughens up and gets used to it?  lol.  i don&#x27;t know how long the smell lasts either.  i may just have to use coppertone sport, as it has all of the same awesomeness as this (protection, oil free, no streaks etc.).  although it smells like typical unpretty sunscreen, it doesn&#x27;t make my face sting, and it&#x27;s cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, i recommend this product for women who love that tanning oil smell, just not on sensitive faces.  who knows, maybe it&#x27;s the sweet, sweet fragrance that is causing my face to sting!  :-P</li>
    <li> I use this product frequently, and I am very satisfied with the protection it provides.</li>
    <li> Good product and smelled nice.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that there was a bit of shimmer in this sunscreen, but it is a nice bonus.  The texture of this lotion is nice - not too thick of greasy.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of coconuts, that&#x27;s why I chose this. The sunblock I had been using smelled really awful. This is a pleasure to use, smells fantastic and is nice and creamy.  Instead of hating spreading the smelly sunblock on my body, now I cannot wait to put this on. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> wonderful color , excellent fit -true to size</li>
    <li> If, like me, you were hoping for the old formulation of HT Sheer Touch lotion, you might be disappointed. It&#x27;s been discontinued in favor of the new Sheer Radiance formula. The pictured sunscreen is the original version, which is NOT WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE if you order the lotion. You will receive the new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is both good and bad. Bad because you&#x27;re not actually getting what&#x27;s pictured, and the posted ingredients label is off as well. Good because the new formula is actually better than the old one - no toxic ingredients and it feels nicer, in my opinion. Still smells good, too. However, the new formula is sparkly which is a little annoying.</li>
    <li> We were given this kind of sunscreen as a gift before our honeymoon to Maui.  It works great and smells great! This is the only kind I ever buy now, and every time I put it on it makes me feel the romance of a Maui honeymoon! Cheesy I know, but I love it :) Smells bring back such good memories.  This one smells great and works great, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This has a very nice smell and very good moustirizarion. But I still got a bad sunburn while wearing this. Applied it every hour. And it also has sparkles in it which get all over clothing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it&#x27;s super light! One warning though, I didn&#x27;t know that &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; means that....it&#x27;s glittery. I slathered on a bunch of sunscreen for a baseball game. I was sitting in the bleachers and looked at my bare legs...and I&#x27;m glowing. Glowing yes...but glittery!! I was sort of embarrassed because I felt like Edward from Twlight. I was glowing and sparkly -_-.</li>
    <li> havent burned once this summer because of this sunscreen! love the way it goes on and smells</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite sunscreen since Banana Boat discontinued their Sunceuticals line.  Nice light tropical fragrance, non greasy and very effective protection.</li>
    <li> The Safeway store I buy most things from didn&#x27;t carry this, and I hate going all over looking for one thing here, one thing there, etc.  So I bought a 5 oz. bottle of a different sunscreen for $8.00.  That didn&#x27;t set well with me, so I searched Amazon and came across this 8 ox bottle of Hawaiian Tropics, which is what I wanted!  Better brand and bigger bottle, for the same amount of money.  So there you have it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking back that pricey other sun screen to Safeway and getting a refund.</li>
    <li> wonderful refreshing scent. I researched the best smelling sunscreens and ended up trying this out, I&#x27;m pleasantly pleased with it and will definitely buy more when this runs out</li>
    <li> Works great at thee beach!</li>
    <li> Item just as described and smells so good! I love the way the lotion feels on my skin, very nice. Packaged very well and shipped as stated. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. Goes on so easily and smells great.  Excellent price. Can be up to $8 in store</li>
    <li> goes on great not hard to apply like coppertone...love the 50 also</li>
    <li> My favorite sunblock...it encompasses everything I&#x27;m looking for! Its a broad spectrum SPF, its lightweight but it doesn&#x27;t rub off when applied properly (always 15-30 minutes before sun exposure people) and it smells ahhh-mazing. Love!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. Spreads like body lotion. If you don&#x27;t want to smell beach-y then don&#x27;t buy as it is yummy coconut scented.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, blends in well and seems to last! My go-to sunblock every summer! I would only say I usually use something lighter on my face because I have sensitive skin but perfect for all over body!</li>
    <li> I live on the coast, so my family goes through a LOT of sunscreen in the summer.  This is by far my favorite sunscreen!  It works great, goes on very smooth, is not greasy, and smells good.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is my ultimate FAVORITE sunscreen, love the subtle smell, not strong at all smells like fruit, love the creaminess of it and use it above the sunscreen that I got at the Plastic Surgeons office!  I LOVE this product, it is hard to find, hope Amazon keeps carrying it and I hope that Hawaiian Tropic keeps making it, wonderful product, also about the scent, I absolutely hate strong scents in all products, this, like I said is very subtle and does not last but for maybe 5 minutes after applying.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best sunscreen out there. It smells and feels great on skin! The lotion is not oily like other sunscreens. My wife uses this sunscreen daily on her face and arms.</li>
    <li> Light scent!  I wear everyday for day to day sun protection. Perfect for those who have aversions to strong smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried, I refuse to buy anything else. I&#x27;m a very fair skinned Irish girl and I burn easily. This sunscreen stays put, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin streaky (like spray ones sometimes can) and hydarates my skin so it doesn&#x27;t dry out. It kept me completely burn free on my 2 week Caribbean trip!</li>
    <li> love this sunscreen, glad I found it cheaper on amazon</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well but leaves sparkles on your skin. Not the best for a guy ;)</li>
    <li> I use this on my face every morning.  It does not get in my eyes or cause my skin to sting like others that are created for the face.  I hope they never change the formula!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this sunblock. As someone with extremely fair skin and a family history of skin cancer, I use a LOT of sunscreen. My face is also really sensitive and even expensive brands tend to irritate my face. This lotion completely soaks into the skin, leaving me feeling dry and not sticky. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my face at all. It smells AMAZING and this is coming from someone who pretty much hates all scented things. It&#x27;s also super effective. I bought enough for my whole family. I highly recommend this sunscreen and I&#x27;m really thrilled I found it! Never going back to other brands! :)</li>
    <li> My bottle was half full. So I guess that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s cheaper than in-store: they sell used bottles. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, was just what I expected! Great deal, too.</li>
    <li> Works great for intense sun, and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Prevents sunburn, not too oily, the scent is not too strong or bad. The spf is just enough for me to avoid getting sun burnt. Bought this on a alert from slick deal for like 4 or 5$, not bad for that price. This bottle is a good size and has lasted me through this summer and will probably last me through next summer as well.</li>
    <li> I grew up in Texas with summers being 105 degrees and we used this all the time it really works and its non greasy goes on like a lotion but let it soak in for about 20 mins before sun exposure for full affect</li>
    <li> This might sound crazy - but this stuff does a great job of keeping horseflies and common flies off of you while you run!  For some reason, they hate the stuff - so now I can run in peace :-)</li>
    <li> Smells great and seems to work. I haven&#x27;t been burned yet.</li>
    <li> Not greasy. Smooth and creamy. Nice size bottle. Wish they would put this in tubes. Is similar to Banana Boat.</li>
    <li> Great product.  For my fair skin, SPF 30 is the way to go for my outside activities.  This lotion is sheer yet covers well and has good staying power.  Occasionally I have sensitivities to certain products but have not had a problem with Hawaiian Tropic.  The smell is unisex and beachy.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this Sunblock - I bought more with my next amazon order! I wear sunblock for daily body protection in my sunny California weather and this sunblock is amazing. The smell is light and neutral (not girly or coconut or weird sunblock smell). There is a slight shimmer, but it is again really light - when my husband wears it he doesn&#x27;t notice the shimmer nor offended by the smell. You have to look close to see the shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big thing for why I love this sunblock is it isn&#x27;t greasy. It dries to a lovely eggshell. It does not feel heavy. It does not get greasy over time with additional layers applied throughout the day. Most importantly, I do not break out while using it!!! Other sunblocks in this price range that I&#x27;ve tried will make my body break out. I&#x27;ve used this product for my face twice and it did well -  though I have a dedicated daily SPF lotion for my face that I prefer over this (for tint, more matte, more lightweight) Paula&#x27;s Choice resist. Otherwise, in a pinch I wouldn&#x27;t have any issues using this product for my face.</li>
    <li> I love this brand. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m in Hawaii, when I&#x27;m really just outside pulling weeds.</li>
    <li> Was tired of all the nasty smelling sun block so I tried this and its awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for years and really enjoy the consistency, smell, and that it actually works. First, this sunscreen has a great consistency. Its thick and not watery - watery sunscreens are a pain - and goes on easily. It rubs in quickly, even if you apply too much. Its not too thick that it won&#x27;t rub in all the way as some of the higher SPF sunscreens and thicker lotions do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the smell is awesome! The first thing I said - and really one of the reasons this is the brand I buy - is that this sunscreen smells SOOO GOOD! Its coconut scented. Reminds me of a tropical paradise. It just &#x27;goes&#x27; with being on the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, this product actually works. You don&#x27;t have to apply it too often. It stays on even when sweating or getting wet. And again, that smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOTE, I gave this product 4 stars and titled it stating that it will burn your face if you start sweating immediately. I don&#x27;t think this is just me because some of my friends have said the same thing, but if you apply this immediately before getting hot and sweaty, this will &#x27;burn&#x27; your face. Not burn it in terms of a physical burn. But it will sting really bad. If you apply it as you should sunscreen, 15 or so minutes before going outside, you won&#x27;t experience this at all.</li>
    <li> I was actually sent this product by Influenster.com to test and review. So far its been working out great for me! Its not greasy at all, has an amazing smell and over all sensitive skin friendly. The only thing that bothered me the first time I used it was that while applying it to my face it burned a bit. The burning sensation went away after a while and it hasn&#x27;t happened again since. Other than that mishap everything about this product is nice.</li>
    <li> the price is great&lt;br /&gt;and it use very well</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works really well, but the thing I love about it the most is the scent. It reminds me of a beach, the best smell for summer! My husband even likes putting it on and he hates sunscreen. It dissolves quickly and is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is awesome. It does it&#x27;s job and keeps me free of suburn. Gave me a sheer but not shiny glowing look on my skin. Worth paying the price for. Is so much better than any brand I&#x27;ve ever tried, and trust me I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
    <li> This brand takes off nail polish for some reason. My friend has the same problem. Sucks because I like the way this wears and smells.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen!  Skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after applying  Has a light, refreshing scent.  Sometimes they make a bonus bottle with additional oz for the same price</li>
    <li> Fabulous protection and fragrance! Used it in Mexico, and did not burn! I am fair-skinned and this offered excellent protection!</li>
    <li> I usually hate sun screen lotions but I have been very happy with this product. It goes on really well, doesn&#x27;t require a lot of rubbing to work it in and it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy. Of course the smell is the other awesome part, it just smells really, really good for a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Bang for buck, trusted name, a lot of value.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sunscreens I&#x27;ve used. It works well, smells great, and goes on easily. I like how it&#x27;s 30 SPF and easy to apply, it&#x27;s not thick like others. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for the past two years and will continue as long as HT keeps it on the market.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Sure this works, but certain ingredients such as avobenzene and any ingredient containing benzene and benzone are found to be cancergens. Many companies use these ingredients since they are so accessible and easy to make. I have done extensive research and found many scientific article that state that only sunscreen containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are non cancergens.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not use this on my body. I&#x27;m trying to prevent skin cancer not rub cancerous substances on my body!</li>
    <li> Always good to have in your Pack</li>
    <li> I love that it is super light, not greasy and the fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering. I think it has a slight shimmer, not sparkly, as others have mentioned. Coverage is great - I have fair skin and I do not burn with this sunblock.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome but hard to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and moisture of this lotion and strongly advocate daily use of sunscreen, so this works great for me. I don&#x27;t like that there are little tiny sparkles in it, but it really is barely noticeable.</li>
