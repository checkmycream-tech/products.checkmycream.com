<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very good!! give friends as gifts.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite chap stick.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm and highly recommend it. It is very moisturizing, the ingredients are all natural, and it has a pleasant, but not strong, fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this chap-stick!  Haven&#x27;t found a better chap-stick on the market!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! It feels so great and you don&#x27;t even need to use it that often because it stays on! Also, it&#x27;s not shiny or anything so it&#x27;s great to use under lipstick or on its own.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use Chapstick often because I have a bad habit of always licking it off because it tastes good but this Chapstick doesn&#x27;t make me want to lick it off. It doesn&#x27;t taste bad or anything it actually doesn&#x27;t really have a taste. The Chapstick itself is really good to use and will leave and keep your lips moist.</li>
    <li> I really like this lip balm. I have used the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; BB lip balm and something about this one is better. The smell is grate and it glides on much smoother and lasts longer. It isn&#x27;t sticky yet smooth and soothing. My fav lip balm on the market for dry lips. I prefer this to chapstick and even over some of those gel tube types.</li>
    <li> I live on the desert where the wind can really take a toll on your lips. This product gives me all day protection and keeps my lips from drying out. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an almost lifelong Chapstick guy who has switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate.  Great stuff.  Only problem is that if the lip balm is raised too high, the cap will smear it and the next time you put it on you risk looking like a kid applying lip stick as a gag.</li>
    <li> I love love love this lip balm. Have been using it for at least 5 years now.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best deal I found (about $9 for a pack of 4).</li>
    <li> My favorite! Smells so good &amp; provides a pink tint.</li>
    <li> I usually make my own lip balm, but this is one of my favorites.  I usually can&#x27;t justify the drugstore price for a tube, but the subscribe and save price made it very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm - much better than chapstick.  It helps my lips without drying them out as some others do.  It&#x27;s hard to find in my smaller town, so I was glad when the light bulb went on and I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Makes me feel like a 16 year old girl - this is great stuff to fend off the winter months, BUT it&#x27;s CHERRY RED. As a guy, I really like everything but that. It IS dark enough that I look like I&#x27;m wearing lipstick. Not ideal, but good enough.</li>
    <li> Held it found to be out of date, but amazon is very good to solve my problem .</li>
    <li> This is the only chapstick I use, since it soothes dry lips and does not make my lips chap more. Great product!</li>
    <li> this lip balm is amazing...i love it. works really good! u cant go wrong with the pomegrante oil. every time i rub my lips together, i feel the moisture...feels like butter.ummmmm!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a lip balm addict for a long time.  I developed an serious allergy to the balms made from petroleum products and had to stop using them.  Then I was in Wal-Mart one day and saw Burt&#x27;s Bees on a shelf and decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than the cheap petroleum based lip balms but it is worth the price!  I goes on smoothly and I actually think it lasts longer too and the flavor is very appealing.  After getting the one from Wal-Mart I ordered a four-pack from amazon and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I&#x27;m so please with this product that I gave one of the tubes to a good friend to try and she loves it as well.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm. It goes on easily, moisturizes well and smells good with no offensive taste. It works exactly as promised. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I used to love this lip balm.  I used it for about 3-4 years, and would carry it in my pocket constantly.  Then, about a year ago, I picked up a tube with a new label (the one that has the green circle on it), and noticed it was different inside the tube as well.  The first thing is the smell of the new formula.  It drives me absolutely insane.  Before, it had a pretty subtle scent; now, it reeks.  Something about it just immediately turns me off it.  The texture seems a bit different, too.  The ingredients have been tweaked, and the result is a product I really can&#x27;t use (I&#x27;ve tried to use it, to see if I would get used to the smell, but I would end up having to wipe it off my lips after a few minutes).      I went out of my way to find tubes of the original formula (I was hoarding lip balm...it sounds insane, but lip balm is one of my \\&quot;desert island\\&quot; items), and now it seems that everywhere I look, all I can find is the new formula.  I&#x27;m looking for a new trusty, everyday lip balm.   Thanks for a good run, Burt&#x27;s Bees, but you&#x27;ve changed (and not in a good, personal growth way).</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of ALL Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this one is my favorite and a winner.  Not too heavy and not too light, it coats well and has an amazing scent.  As a person who never smelled pomegranate, I was unsure of trying it, but was tired of the original scent.  But I am glad I did.  I wish they could make a variation without coconut oil as my husband can not have this on his lips because of allergies.  I have one in my purse, one on my desk, and I keep one by my bedside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapstick never worked for me, but this product does.  I consider this more of a preventive product than a &#x27;healing&#x27; product.  If your lips are extremely chapped and this product isn&#x27;t solving it, try a light coating of Aquaphor on your lips, it helped me one day when they were so brittle and dry.</li>
    <li> It hardly feels moisturizing, and there&#x27;s nearly zero shine. It&#x27;s also hard to apply on the lips due to friction and takes multiple applications to get a decent level of moisture, but you&#x27;ll also get a slightly deeper shade of pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Blistex Deep Renewal way better than this which is less than 2 bucks. If you don&#x27;t care about the price, and want to get a good natural, moisturizing lip balm with a decent shine, I&#x27;d recommend Herban Body Care&#x27;s Lip Butter Lip Balm at $6.50. It&#x27;s the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used, but is pricey when you add the shipping cost.</li>
    <li> Some people may love the smell of flowers, but floral fragrances really bother me.  I never would have expected this to smell like that, being pomegranate.  But it does, and it&#x27;s really strong.  The beeswax kind doesn&#x27;t smell like that at all.  This one and the honey one both do.  Back to beeswax for me!</li>
    <li> this lip balm is nice, but it has like a peppermint flavor and kinda tingles, which I did not expect.  I was hoping for it to be more &amp;#34;berry&amp;#34; flavored and taste.  still, it does the job and feels nice.  doesn&#x27;t add much color to your lips either though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a chapstick addict, I go nuts after a few hours of dry lips. And I always lose my tubes. So DH finally bought me 3 x 4 packs so I can always find one! This is my #1 balm: subtle pom scent, just a hint of red color, and a smooth/waxy/slippery consistency. I find the regular (peppermint) burt&#x27;s bees to drag a little on my lips, especially when cold but this is the perfect smooth texture for me. Only downside is if I keep it in my pocket or somewhere hot, it does get really soft and detached from the tube sometimes.  Oh and don&#x27;t be like me and leave the tubes in your pockets when you wash! yucky oil stains on the whole load, not fun! (actually I think it&#x27;s from the dryer heat so if you catch the tube in between, it should be ok).</li>
    <li> I have been having a problem with my lips being chapped all the time. I went to a dermatologist and had no good answers.  This product has helped me immensely.  My problem is virtually fixed. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Although a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, I was rather disappointed by the pomegranate variation. First off, the smell from the lip balm is pleasant, but once applied to lips it does smell rather strange and, well, unpleasant. I also found this balm oilier than the original variation and that it added more redness to my lips--something I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of. I&#x27;d stick with the peppermint variation, as it has a nice smell, not oily, and has a more neutral color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap. Good price. It&#x27;s soft and moist. I can use this item  during spring to winter.It is very useful item.</li>
    <li> This product has a new formula and it is not the same as the old one from just a year ago. It doesn&#x27;t apply as smoothly or moisturize as well as the old formula. I noticed something was up when I just ordered some more to replace my old ones from last winter. I checked the labels and sure enough, there are 8 new ingredients listed on the tube. Now I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for some obscure, family-owned business that sells home made lip balm.</li>
    <li> I was at an airport in the Midwest during the dry winter spell, and I needed something to soothe my chapped lips. I picked up a tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate Lip Balm, and was completely sold. I was a die hard Blistex brand user, and I never thought I would switch. Now I order Burt&#x27;s Bees in bulk and have them shipped to Europe, because it is the only thing I will put on my lips. I have a tube in my purse, on my bed stand, and even in my car. A tube is never far from reach. I love this product!</li>
    <li> This balm is lightly and pleasantly scented. It is not one of their heaviest lip balms, which I personally like - for daytime/summer use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;I apply neutral colored lip liner and then I apply this lip balm. It has very little shine and no tint to it. I apply a light shade of lip gloss on top. I am very happy with the results when I want a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I researched a few of the PRIMARY INGREDIENTS for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helianthus annuus seed oil:&lt;br /&gt;Rich in oleic acids and contains high content of Vitamins A, D, and E. Also contains lecithin and unsaturated fatty acids making it a nourishing and conditioning oil for skin and hair.  Treats dry, damaged, or mature skin and hair. Provides moisture and protective layer to the skin (Wiki).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cera Alba (beeswax):&lt;br /&gt;Great for helping hold in moisture and prevents clogging of pores. Can be used as a healing agent and as a freestanding ingredient has been revered for centuries. Helps create a pleasant silky texture in cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocos Nucifera (COCONUT) oil:&lt;br /&gt;Great for moisturizing! Serves as a protective layer, helping to retain the moisture in your skin. Very mild and great for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ricinus Communis (castor) seed oil:&lt;br /&gt;Softens dry  heels, knees, elbows, patches of eczema, and psoriasis.  Provides protection from exposure to drying detergents, hot water, and winter air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lanolin:&lt;br /&gt;Lanolin and its related ingredients moisturize the skin, hair and nails. These ingredients act as a lubricants on the skin surface, which gives the skin a soft, smooth appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pomegranate seed oil:&lt;br /&gt;Extremely rich and nutritious oil, potent source of punicic and ellagic acids. It may be used for internally or externally for its cosmetic and medicinal properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this was helpful to you! Enjoy and God bless :)od bless :)</li>
    <li> I used to buy this all the time and I like it better than the original Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips and application is smooth.  The original one feels sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT price!</li>
    <li> it works, but below my expectation</li>
    <li> This is the ULTIMATE chapstick! You don&#x27;t have to reapply it every 10 friggin minutes and it has a hint of color that is just right! Not so bright that you look like a clown but just enough to give you a perfect healthy kissable looking pout! I love this stuff :) There is one thing some people may not like which is it smells a little perfumey...</li>
    <li> Before Burt&#x27;s Bees, I tried a lot of lip balms but none seem to moisturise my lips enough. Then this lip balm came along and I&#x27;ve been in love since. It smells great, tastes great, feels great on your lips and most importantly, keeps my lips super moisturised.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing every minute on your lips. I love it. A little bit color that makes your lips look healthy. Good smell. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite chapstick. It has a slight sheer red tint and smells delicious.</li>
    <li> This lip balm has a slight pinkish red tint, a nice flavor and as with all of my Burts Bees Balms is the perfect texture balm.</li>
    <li> Just a hint of color. keeps lips really moist.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product, but my daughter is a celiax and can only use this brand..so i bought it for her...</li>
    <li> Great lip balm! Keeps lips very moist, and quickly effective. A lovely pomegranate scent, also long lasting. Also keeps lips moist longer than any other lip balm I have ever used. I would defiantly recommend this to a friend. Well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees products for some time now and find them very effective. This lip balm is no exception!</li>
    <li> great product. It smells good and really nourishes the lips. It does look like it has a little tint to it, it definitely makes my lips look a little rosier at first but the tint wears away quickly.</li>
    <li> My best friend and her family are hooked on Burts Bees and were always telling me that it helped keep their lips healthy and from being chapped so I decided to try it when I found it on sale at my local drugstore. I&#x27;ve been using it the past six months and I have noticed that it does do well at keeping your lips soft, especially when putting it on right before taking a shower. I also get a very nice natural looking tint too which I like. And I notice that when I don&#x27;t keep up with this my lips go back to peeling all the time, like they had before using this. But the taste and smell of it isn&#x27;t the greatest, nothing like pomegranates at all, and the feel of it on my lips isn&#x27;t that wonderful either. It feels thick, in lack of better words, when I put it on even when I apply it very lightly. And I have to reapply throughout the day but I find you have to do that for most lip products. Overall it is a good lip balm and will keep using it until something else catches my eye.</li>
    <li> I am a big Burts Bees fan.  This is another great product I have been using for a while.  I like it better than the traditional Burts lip balm they are famous for.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, but I&#x27;m not crazy about this particular flavor.  It smells/tastes a little like citronella to me.</li>
    <li> When I want a little color, I apply a few coats of this and it gives my lips a rosy glow. It&#x27;s very natural looking, not like lipstick at all, but with a little color and sheen. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing, although I have found it is not as long lasting as other Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms. I have to apply it a little more frequently, maybe two to three times more in the day than I would with the other lip balms. It has such a great smell I really don&#x27;t mind, though. And it really soaks into the lips and gives them a boost of deep moisture.</li>
    <li> Burts is always quality</li>
    <li> My lips have always been dry so I&#x27;ve tested tons of different lip balms throughout the years. Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate lip balm is moisturizing enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when applied and I do like the fact that it adds a little bit of shine and just a hint of color - and I can still apply it any time, anywhere - without using a mirror. Love its fresh, fruity scent, too!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest stuff for dry lips, it goes on smooth, has a nice flavor and fragrance, keeps my lips in good health.</li>
    <li> This chapstick glides on smoothly, has a nice taste, and a slight reddish tint. I never wear lipstick and this adds just a touch of a natural color. Can&#x27;t live without it...especially in the winter!</li>
    <li> Best lip balm I&#x27;ve used and have used for years.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember all the details, but I read an article once about the amount of lipstick and lip balm women consume in their lifetime, and it&#x27;s pretty astounding. It&#x27;s great to have a terrific natural product that goes on silky, and works so incredibly well!</li>
    <li> My son got badly chapped lips during a dry spell, and one or two applications a day was all it took to clear everything up.  The ingredients are much better than the big brands with all the synthetics and petroleum based chemicals.</li>
    <li> The good thing about this lip balm is that it has a great smell and a good texture.  It applies smooth, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot and it really feels like my lips are protected from wind and further chapping.  Also the package doesn&#x27;t seem to accumulate a lot of gunk around the lid - maybe that&#x27;s just an issue I have, but I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a lack of it here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER - I bought this when my lips were only a little chapped and it worked well for me.  As the winter went on, I found that this really stopped working for me, and I think it actually made my lips require more lip balm than normal.  Over time, I didn&#x27;t feel any improvement even after reapplying even several times an hour.  My mom happened to pick me up a generic tube of chapstick from Walgreen&#x27;s and I haven&#x27;t looked back at Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is good for an everyday lip balm used before your lips are really painful.  I will try this in summer and see if I like it any better, but for dry, flaky lips I&#x27;m going to look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate Lip Balm is by far the best product I have found to use on dry lips in a dry climate (Arizona).  I&#x27;ve tried many other products, but there is no comparison with Burt&#x27;s Bees.  What more can be said? It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the Burt&#x27;s Bees line. All of their stuff is natural, and although sometimes can be pricey it is definitely worth it. This is one of my favorite chapsticks to use for multiple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Nice scent. It smells sweet but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;2. Nice color. Adds a tiny bit of color to your lips, which I love! It is good to wear during the day when you do not need too heavy of a color.&lt;br /&gt;3. Smooth application.&lt;br /&gt;4. Definitely refreshing to dry lips! I used it this past winter and after I would apply it I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about my lips for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this range of lip balm. I have pretty dry lips and always had the challenge of applying a lip balm that stays put below lipstick or lip gloss for work. The tint in these have just the perfect colour to wear everyday for work along with light makeup, and the smooth rich texture glides on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant, and its not the slightest bit sticky or a heavy lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;Also loving the lip gloss versions - its really the best of both worlds :)</li>
    <li> I have not liked other burts bees lip balms, but this stuff is awesome!! It goes on not to heavy but enough for really dry lips, we live in a COLD climate in the winter so this is important!  Light scent is a plus, keeps lips hydrated for hours.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip balm ever.  It applies smoothly and has a very gentle scent/flavor.  I use this in lieu of lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great consistency&lt;br /&gt;Great scent/flavor&lt;br /&gt;Faint light pink tint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The faint light pink tint might not be what a man wants to wear, just a heads up</li>
    <li> I really like it but most of them break so you can&#x27;t use some of what is left.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is a great lip balm but it is so expensive.Sometimes you have to pay a little more to get a better quality product. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey!</li>
    <li> I have always had chapped lips and this is the only Chapstick that will actually keep my lips smooth. I have tried ALLOT of other ones, and the results were no where near as good as Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> I have really chapped lips from working outside in the sun and the wind all day long, every day.  For years, I have battled trying to find something that will help.  Tried carmex but couldn&#x27;t get past the nasty smell and flavor and have been using chapstick for years with mediocre results, everything else was just like putting plastic on my lips.  Finally, I got a tube of Burt&#x27;s Pomegranate in a gift bag and started using it.  Right away I could tell the difference.  It is super moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t feel thick and suffocating on my lips like some other brands, and doesn&#x27;t wear off every 5 minutes like chapstick does.  Plus, it gives me just a hint of color to my lips.  I really like that because I&#x27;m not much of a lipstick kinda girl.  My only complaint is that this flavor seems to have a strange aftertaste (I have a habit of licking my lips).  There is a bit of a bitter undertone to it that I don&#x27;t like very much.  I know it wasn&#x27;t a freak thing with it just being 1 tube because it&#x27;s happened with every tube I&#x27;ve gotten since.  I wasn&#x27;t aware that there were other flavors but I am going to try them next, hopefully they won&#x27;t have that funky tinge to them.  All in all, I am very happy with this product and I suspect the odd taste may just be my own taste buds acting funny Haha.</li>
    <li> Unlike the original Burt&#x27;s bees lip balm this does not have the menthol, which I liked about the original. What it does have is a great moisturizer. This is lightweight and delightful on the lips</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  The slight red tint of color isn&#x27;t very much so a guy can use it without worrying.  It smells good, feels nice, and does exactly what lip balm was invented to do.. protect and moisturize your lips.  This is the only one I buy now.</li>
    <li> Smells like tea. I hate the smell of tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sister likes it though. Works great.</li>
    <li> Since I use it and wanted a supply for many locations throughout the house, purse, car, it was perfect.  The winter weather causes chapped lips; so this was a good buy.</li>
    <li> I had seen great reviews of all Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and this was no different. Well imagine my surprise when I put this $2.50/tube lip balm on and now my lips smell like a citronella candle (those big ugly candles in a bucket you buy to keep mosquitos away). Well, on the upside, in the summer the mosquitoes won&#x27;t bother me. Too bad I can&#x27;t stand the smell of my own lips!</li>
    <li> I gave up on messy gooey lip gloss years ago and now religiously use this product. This is the best lip balm I have used in years and have I love the extra tint of pink (very slight but there) it adds to my lip color.  I have them stashed everywhere from my purse, car, work desk drawer, gym bag, front door, to night stand.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The product is great and my wife loves the protection it gives and the flavor that it has! Great product.</li>
    <li> I used Vaseline on my lips for years and switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees a few years ago. I now can&#x27;t imagine going back! This is non-greasy but stays on for a long time, feels great on dry chapped lips.</li>
    <li> Tried first time after using other flavors of this product.  It&#x27;s very nice, not greasy and lasts enough time.  Will buy more and recommend trying.</li>
    <li> My favorite BB Lip Balm at a really good price!</li>
    <li> This balm in pomegranate is by far my most favorite lip balm ever. I have these EVERYWHERE, purse, &amp;#34;junk drawer&amp;#34;, bathroom, car, desk at work, etc. I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t have any issue when using this lip balm. I like that it goes on smooth and my lips stay moisturized.  I don&#x27;t care for the other flavors of balms from burt&#x27;s bees but I&#x27;d give the pomegranate oil balm a 10!</li>
    <li> This stuff is not as good as the original Burt&#x27;s Bees peppermint flavor. It is thinner and it actually leaves my lips feeling dryer once it wears out in about ten minutes. I would recommend passing on this and going for the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s bright red. Ugh.</li>
    <li> The Pomegranate oil smells and tastes disgusting. I am a fan of the original peppermint scent. I never liked the Honey one and the Mango is okay. But the Pomegranate oil is really there with the Honey one. I disliked it every time I tried it on my lips. The smell and feel of it is just ugh! I do not like it. It&#x27;s repulsive and I don&#x27;t want to have it on my lips at all. I would rather throw it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had chapped lips, it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve just come to accept. 99.99% of tubed lip balms only last as long as they&#x27;re on my lips, doing nothing to condition my lips at all. Burt&#x27;s Pomegranate lip balm works as well as most of it&#x27;s kind (not great but provides temporary relief), but I really don&#x27;t appreciate the scent. It&#x27;s sharp, kind of medicinal, it&#x27;s unpleasant for me, and I never managed to acclimate to it before it wears off of my lips (the smell goes away only once my lips feel dry, which is to say, 3-4 hours). I got a three pack somewhere, and passed the other two on to a family member... who also did not like the scent, and passed them on to a friend who was a pomegranate fan (in general, not sure how they felt about this scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to try tubed balms because they&#x27;re a lot more convenient than ointments, don&#x27;t involve jamming my finger in a pot, and aren&#x27;t sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone wondering, the only tube lip balm that&#x27;s done me any good came from an oral surgeon&#x27;s office with their info on the label, so I can&#x27;t even make a brand recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because it&#x27;s average as temporary relief for me, but the scent is unpleasant to me and doesn&#x27;t go away until the product has worn off.</li>
    <li> This product is least advertised...but once i started using it, i love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect my lips to be turned pink any time soon...however it did protect me from the harsh winter in chicago...with no blisters.</li>
    <li> Like the flavor and the texture!  Put it on at night to keep your lips feeling smooth.and soft. Avoids chapped lips.</li>
    <li> This is a truly awesome product..I bought several of them to give to family members.  Its not greasy or waxy and can be worn under lipstick or alone.</li>
    <li> Smells great, just like pomegranate. Reminds me of eating Pinkberry in the warm Summer months. Has a dark pink, almost red tint that doesn&#x27;t really show on your lips. Goes on creamy, not greasy, velvety smooth. Hydrates lips and helps them to look plump.</li>
    <li> O my these lip balms I got are great, my lips are so soft even protected after a hot date with a lot of use if you know what I mean. Thank you &amp;#34;Burt&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought the pack of 4, but only got one. why?</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife&#x27;s lips. A good investment. This stuff keeps them supple and that is to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like some Burt&#x27;s Bees products and leave some alone. Just about all their lip protection balms and cremes are good. Buy a three-pak so you can always have one  within reach.  (Don&#x27;t leave in hot car).</li>
    <li> great product as good price and product came in tip top condition. Bought as gifts and friends all love it!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this lip balm very much! Not only does it keep my lips soft and moisturized, but it also adds a bit of color. I am not a fan of red lip balms and lipsticks, but the color is not too vibrant; just a pretty light tint. I was pleased with the color. This balm works very well for me. My lips had been chapped, dry, and we&#x27;re aching from the dryness and applying this lip balm brought instant relief! I recommend Burt&#x27;s bees lip balm over any other brand!</li>
    <li> pros: it works, smooth non-waxy texture, subtle tint/sheen, light scent, all natural, comes in a tube (which is way less gross than the balm pots), &amp; affordable&lt;br /&gt;cons: no spf</li>
    <li> One application lasts so long, it&#x27;s got a nice natural, pomegranate scent and it makes my lips just a little bit pinker - just enough to be noticeable.  I don&#x27;t wear lipstick, I&#x27;m a gloss person but gloss dries out my lips so I only wear it when I go out, and I wear it over this.  This lip balm is pretty perfect.  Great price for the 3 pack too.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick of any kind are great.  Will never use another brand</li>
    <li> the smell of this stuff is disgusting, it makes me sick to my stomach. This is the only flavor I don&#x27;t like</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm so much. At first I bought a mixed back but I always came back to the pomegranate oil because it never dry. It smells delicious like pomegranates and stays on for a long time.</li>
    <li> I only tried this product because Chapstick stopped making their all natural version. I&#x27;m glad I did, I prefer this to Chapstick. It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> I found the Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate Oil limp balm about 8 years ago and have been using it ever since - thank goodness I can get it from Amazon now! I use it year-round and it keeps my lips moist in all seasons. Five stars both for the product and in thanks for Amazon for carrying this wonderful lip balm!</li>
    <li> Burts Bees lip balm arrived in good order. It works okay but Burts Bees items do not seem the same as before.&lt;br /&gt;Speedy delivery</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s not for eating but it&#x27;s nice to have a lipgloss that moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t taste awful.  This one has a delicate scent and is only lightly flavored.  I have a few of these in various places and enjoy them.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s bees. If I am taking my time to write a review I shouldn&#x27;t be required to write so many words. If this is required I should receive a gift card for my time.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, slight color and feel of this.</li>
    <li> Just my opinion, there&#x27;s nothing special about this product.  It keeps lips hydrated true, but as to staying power there is no difference with the &#x27;other market share brand.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love burt bee&#x27;s products in general.  However, I have always stuck to this particular lip balm.  It serves the purpose well.</li>
    <li> I ordered a pack of 4 of these from Amazon, but when the item arrived there were only 3 tubes included. The bag they were put in was not properly sealed at the top and one tube must have escaped before being packaged and shipped to me.</li>
    <li> don,t like the taste and makes lips to red looks like lip stick girls laugh at me so gave them to my friend won,t buy this one anymore</li>
    <li> These are so much cheaper than buying them in stores individually, and they&#x27;re the only chapstick I use.</li>
    <li> burts bees doing an awesome job like always&lt;br /&gt;five stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw this healed my dads cold sore in a matter of 2 days?!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lip balms!  Healthy ingredients, smooth application, delicious-smelling and very, very light tint only.  You can hardly tell it tints at all, really.  And it contains no peppermint oil like some of the other Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products.</li>
    <li> Very much like this pomegranate lip balm!  Has a light, soothing texture that protects well and leaves my lips feeling soft and moisturized.  Not nearly as thick feeling as plain ChapStick.  Pleasant scent that quite often elicits a kiss from my spouse!  No tinted look, when applied. Keeps my lips from being chapped, even in cold or dry weather.  Much prefer it over other brands.  Also like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax (Peppermint) Lip Balm, but like this just a little more.  Good for everyday and every night use.  All natural, too.  Not too expensive.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I find that I don&#x27;t have to reapply this as often as I had to with petroleum based chapsticks.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this one - I love burts bees original but this one is weird! It smells and tastes very perfumey, not fruity like the name (pomegranate) would suggest. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees. Pomegranate is my fav.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite lip balm. Unlike other lip balm brands I&#x27;ve tried (some of which have cost &amp;#62;$20 for a similarly sized tube), Burt&#x27;s Bees does a great job of moisturizing my lips and maintaining the moisturization for the rest of the day. It also doesn&#x27;t have an oily texture and to top it all off, it smells great!</li>
    <li> Great stuff love this lip balm</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Burt &#x27;s bees.  I don&#x27;t have to explain the quality.  We go through a lot and this lip balm.  It was a good price, especially when you are not paying shipping.</li>
    <li> Requested by my daughter-in-law for Christmas -- she loves it.</li>
    <li> i brought this because everybody said burts bees lip balm was good so i picked up the pomegrante because i thought it would smell goood and it did but that&#x27;s where it stopped because it didnt replenish my lips it kind of felt like oil being appiled to my lips, it would dry out quickly and i found myself reapplying it often throughout the day. i dont think i&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
    <li> Other reviewers are right: the formula has changed, and this is an inferior product.  This new stuff just kind of sits on my lips like an oil slick -- it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s penetrating at all.  Bummer.  The old formula was my standby, favorite lip balm for years.  I&#x27;m also annoyed at the sneaky switcheroo -- it&#x27;s not apparent on the packaging.  Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live or go anywhere with out my pomegranate lip balm! I keep them everywhere.... in my purse, bedroom, living room, kitchen at work.</li>
    <li> Burt Bee&#x27;s products are a bit pricey to me, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to get a good deal here.   I do feel that one has to constantly reapply the lip balm... doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.  I have high expectations for burt bee&#x27;s product.  But definitely a better moisturizer than their plain honey lip balm.</li>
    <li> I have tried and lost all manner of lip balms, including the budgety ones at dollar stores, and this is the best balm and worth the cost -- you definitely get what you par for. It does not get waxy or clumpy and keeps chapping at bay. The tint is almost imperceptible yet does add a wee sheen of color, making it the perfect alternative to lipstick, which I think looks kinda wonky on women after a certain age. And, this is a good deal for a pack of four.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years and it is a great.  Keep them in dressing room, kitchen, office and pocket.  No more dry or split lips.</li>
    <li> Really don&#x27;t have much to say.  This is for my daughter and this is the only brand &amp; flavor she will use.  She swears it is the best.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite lip balm.</li>
    <li> I love this pomegranate version. However, as a guy (one who doesn&#x27;t wear lipstick), I would prefer this to be colorless. No, it won&#x27;t make your lips beet red, but it does add just a bit of tone, and when you pull off the cap and people see that it&#x27;s red, they might give you strange looks. Not that I care, but I just figured I&#x27;d alert people to the possibility of that side effect. Still a great product though. Does anyone know if they make a colorless pomegranate balm? :D</li>
    <li> This looks red in the tube but does not color the lips, which is fine with me, but someone looking for tint might be disappointed.  It has a very pleasant scent, presumably pomegranate, but to me it smells like iced tea with lemon.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a whim and love it so much my family uses it too! Keeps lips soft and kissably-poofy always!</li>
    <li> I used to use the pomegrante lip balm continuously! Then I went to buy more and noticed it felt different.  I compared the new tube with my old tube and sure enough the formula HAS BEEN CHANGED!  The new formula is awful, and it is made with soybean oil, which is really bad for you and makes the lip balm drying and does not work! READ ABOUT SOY PRODUCTS and you too will boycott!!!  The whole formula is now changed and not the same product.  I did find several of the original formula lip balm at a local drug store and bought up there whole supply!  Once that is gone, I will have to switch to another brand entirely.  NO stores carry the old formula anymore.  TO BURT&#x27;S BEES corporate: consumers are aware of their products.  You can&#x27;t go changing formulas and think no one will notice.  You should have left perfection alone.  COCA COLA company made the same mistake once, but they got smart and switched back.  SO SHOULD YOU!!!!!  BURTS BEES was founded on quality ingredients for consumers that are aware of what they buy.  It won&#x27;t take long for them to find out that all your product ingredients are being changed and now made with CHEAP, CANCER CAUSING INGREDIENTS!!!!</li>
    <li> Got this and some other little stuff for my sis for Christmas. This is a great stocking stuffer. Who doesn&#x27;t like Burt&#x27;s Bees?</li>
    <li> Love this chap stick!!! So much that I buy it in bulk on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used this lip balm for years, love it and always have at least 2 in my purse.  I love the light lip tint and that it stays on my lips for a long time.  It is almost silky and thin, not waxy and thick like other lip balms.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice moisturizer for your lips.  Goes on smooth, smells great and lip dryness  and cracking are gone.</li>
    <li> The price is cheaper than the store and the merchandise is the same, great product!</li>
    <li> Like it so much ... They are really beautiful ... definitely I will ask again&lt;br /&gt;Like it so much ... They are really beautiful ... definitely I will ask again</li>
    <li> On time and exactly as stated</li>
    <li> Product is just as described very well packaged to no complaints here</li>
    <li> Good stuff . . . one of the best options</li>
    <li> As a man, I don&#x27;t use lip balm much because I rarely get dry lips. Only in the most severe winters do even try to use it and usually only end up buying 1 stick per year. My fiance on the other hand, suffers from severe dry/chapped lips and usually goes through several sticks a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She prefers Burt&#x27;s Bees over traditional lip balms, but as most of us that have purchased lip balms in the past know that Burt&#x27;s Bees carries a premium price vs other brands. So for the most part, she just buys the petroleum based products (whether Chapstick, Blistex, or the generics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expiration: My primary concern about buying this product (since Burt&#x27;s Bees is natural) is the expiration date. As I mentioned before in my past reviews, buying anything with an expiration date online sometimes becomes a concern for me simply because you don&#x27;t know if what you&#x27;re buying is something that&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse for months (or years) after the expiration date. I am 99.% sure that Amazon has strict standards and have yet to have a \\&quot;bad product\\&quot; from them, so when I made my purchase, I made sure Amazon.com was the company that my item was *SOLD FROM*. Although there are other options for more buying choices, I&#x27;m still hesitant if Amazon is not the seller/shipper. Looking at the Burt&#x27;s Bees balms I have received, I immediately started searching for a date and saw the stamp \\&quot;3221101\\&quot; on all my lip balms. So any consumer, especially me would have thought that maybe 32211 &#x3D; March 22, 2011. But is this an expiration date or a manufacturered date? I started doing some investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Burt&#x27;s Bees corporate page, it is stated that there is a shelf life (due to natural ingredients) but they are unable to provide an expiration date. However, the product should be in good quality condition for 3 years past their date. Further explanation shows that the number stamp I see on my lip balms is actually a lot code that consists of the date it was manufactured and the last 2 digits being the lot code. HOWEVER, for some strange reason, Burt&#x27;s Bees uses the Julian Date for the first THREE numbers, but the actual year is the normal year. So my number of 3221101 is actually:&lt;br /&gt; 322 Julian Date (actually November 18th in Gregorian)&lt;br /&gt; 11 &#x3D; 2011&lt;br /&gt; 01 &#x3D; Batch Number&lt;br /&gt;So based on their explanation, my tubes were made on Nov 18, 2011 and will last until Nov 18, 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beeswax vs Petroleum: This is an ongoing debate that has advocates for each side. The effects of each are the same (helps moisturize/seal moisture) on your lips. But there are some people who refuse to use Petroleum-based lip balms (Chapstick/Blistex) on their lips due to the fact that it&#x27;s made from petroleum (same stuff as gasoline comes from) and some say that can cause cancer. On the flipside, beeswax is made from bees which is natural and there are no known side effects. But since there is the danger of the honeybees declining in population, it may not be around forever and in turn, is usually more expensive than petroleum based lip balms. As I said previously, my fiance loves Burt&#x27;s Bees but it can be quite pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Around here in Nashville, TN, Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm is over $3 per stick + tax. Compared to the .99 cent generic petroleum-based lip balms or $1.29 for a brand name like Chapstick, it&#x27;s no wonder why you would reach for the $1.29 option. However because Amazon is such an awesome place to shop, they sell the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees 0.15 ounce balms in a 4-pack for around $10.17. The end price per stick is roughly $2.54, so you save over 50 cents per stick. So if you&#x27;re looking to save money and like Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, just buy it from Amazon unless you can get it cheaper locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!d and the last 2 digits being the lot code.

    <li> This arrived quickly, and saved me over $1 a tube. I would definitely buy this again and recommend to anyone who loves Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan for years.  This Lip Balm is the best as it really keeps my lips moist and there&#x27;s just a hint of color to enhance the natural color of my lips.  Highly recommend.  Item ships fasts and arrived in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> Last year, I was in Walgreens and happened to stumble by Burt&#x27;s Bees Replenishing Pomegranate. Once I tried it out for the first time at home, I immediately fell in love with it. It was perfect because it smelled wonderfully like pomegranate, but also too because I had been looking for a lip balm that leaves a little color for a while now. It replenishes your lips perfectly and not only that - it hasn&#x27;t only happened once that one of my friends mistake it for lip gloss. I stick to only this kind now and would definitely recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  I love these lip balms!  They do NOT leave a reddish color - even though the balm is a berry color.  There is a mild, pleasant berry odor.  It&#x27;s not like Chapstik with a waxy feel - more of a replenishing &amp; moisturizing feel.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love Burt&#x27;s Bees so I decided to try this. The scent is pleasant, reminds me of Rosemary. I will be purchasing more soon!</li>
    <li> Wonderful,It is not greasy,very moisturize your lips,&lt;br /&gt;and keeps lips from chapping in the cold weather&lt;br /&gt;Its smell is also very good</li>
    <li> The reason I like Burt&#x27;s Pomegranate, is because it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried another brand of \\&quot;bees\\&quot; lip balm ... it just didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, I always buy this.</li>
    <li> I come from a warm country, so in the winter my lips turn into a wasteland.  I&#x27;ve been using chapstick for a long time, because i like the smell and it helps protect my lips...  many people told me good things about Burt&#x27;s Bees, that it&#x27;s natural and great - but the smell and taste of the regular lip balm was so bad, i couldn&#x27;t use it.  this one is great!  1. not too oily.  2. doesn&#x27;t make your lips too pink (phew)  3. smells and tastes great.  4. all natural  5. protects my lips very all.  enjoy.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees pomegranate lip balm was my first foray into the Burt&#x27;s Bees line, and I absolutely love it!  The scent is pleasantly sweet without being overbearing, and I only smell it in the tube, not while the lip balm is on.  The hint of color is a healthy pink/red but not intense enough to be a lip tint or even a sheer lip color- it really is just a hint.  The balm&#x27;s texture when applying is silky smooth, and the quality of the lip balm is amazing!  I didn&#x27;t think I had very chapped lips and yet I still see improvement.  My lips are smooth and supple thanks to Burt&#x27;s Bees pomegranate lip balm- a really terrific product!</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm so I thought that I would love this too because I like other pomegranate products.  However, I don&#x27;t think this one moisturizes as well as the original.  I guess just also really prefer the peppermint tingle.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegrante Lip Balm is the only thing that keeps my lips from drying out too much.  Nothing - I repeat - Nothing ever worked for me.  And as far as I can tell does NOT have SPF sunscreen ~ my research on regarding SPF-anything is not safe and may cause more than it helps.  I&#x27;m thrilled that Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> As always Burt&#x27;s Bees has satisfied my desires for a sweet smelling defense against dry, cracked lips! And what deal!</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews that customers put up and the almost empty tube I had matched their description so I wasn&#x27;t too worried. Received the product and realized that there are numerous unpronounceable ingredients that were not in the tube I had. It seems like the all natural is no longer all natural. The smell wasn&#x27;t too horrible to me until my boyfriend asked me if I had a dip in...apparently the new pomegranate rejuvenating Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s smells exactly like a popular flavored dip. Not an encouraging smell to have on my lips.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for quite some time now. It is great that the product is all natural and works well. I like it much better then the generic chap stick stuff I used to use for years.</li>
    <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees original peppermint lip balm; I think it protects well and I like the admittedly strong peppermint essence. Despite my fondness for that product, I have met people that think Burt&#x27;s Bees peppermint balm stings when it is applied and also believe it is too aggressive in its flavoring.  The pomegranate lip balm applies smoothly and isn&#x27;t heavy, but it does seem to be a bit oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this product is as good as the original Burt&#x27;s in terms of longevity. This balm seems to have a lighter consistency and the application dissipates in cold weather rather quickly. I live in the Midwest where it is often cold and dry and while this lip balm has done a good job keeping my lips smooth and moisturized, I have to apply it constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the company changed the product ingredients recently.  They added more ingredients.  On old tubes, the ingredient list stopped at carmine.  There is now a cinnamon taste that is probably attributable to the cinnamal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at Big Lots for about two dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, cera alba (beeswax, cire d&#x27;abeille), cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, lanolin, aroma (flavor), punica granatum (pomegranate) seed oil, tocopherol, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, glycine soja (soybean) oil, canola oil (huile de colza), carmine, benzyl salicylate, cinnamal, citral, eugenol, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, limonene, linalool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in the United States and not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm with Mango butter and since I like Pomegranates, expected Burt&#x27;s Bees with Pomegranate oil to be good too. What a disappointment, the smell and taste was unpleasant--more like chemical than fruit. I threw it away in disgust. Other reviews say the original formula was was changed--for the worse. I have to agree with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the repugnant pomegranate, I was wary of trying the Acai berry but pleasant surprise--that one smells &amp; tastes good. So forget Pomegranate and try Burt&#x27;s Bees &#x27;Rejuvenating&#x27; with Acai berry instead.</li>
    <li> I have very dry lips, and this is the only lip balm I use now. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brands, but this is by far the best. It&#x27;s even great under lipstick, and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> it smells great and it&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy. the slight tint is nice and i like that the ingredients are all-natural.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect solution for chapped lips in the dry conditions of the Front Range of Colorado.  Carry it with me everywhere...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip gloss!  Only a slight color and very creamy.  I can no longer find it in the stores, but Amazon to the rescue!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to pretty much all lipsticks, including the &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; ones, and this is the only stuff that I can use.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip balm. It gives my lips a tint of pink. The lip balm is not sweet. Which I love. I don&#x27;t like sweet lip balm, gross. One of my top favorite products ever!</li>
    <li> Lips moist and good. Prices are reasonable and easy repurchase doctor may be mobile&lt;br /&gt;Lips moist and good. Prices are reasonable and easy repurchase doctor may be mobile</li>
    <li> This order arrived on time in perfect condition. I order this lip balm for my wife because it is her very favorite and I love kissing her soft lips. I have used it myself a few times this winter and found that it is excellent for my lips, too. The price is excellent on these and we will be ordering more in the near future. We recommend this product to our friends all over the world. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase from the Burt&#x27;s Bees brand.  I had been using [[ASIN:B001115TO4 Blistex Complete Moisture Lip Balm SPF 15 -- 0.15 oz]] for many many years.  I think the reason I found out about [[ASIN:B002DPUY06 Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate Lip Balm Tube, .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]] was because I was trying to make the requirement to get free shipping on another website and they didn&#x27;t have the Blistex I used available so I ordered this instead.  I&#x27;m very glad I did.  It goes on very smooth, it&#x27;s not too thick and it feels good on the lips.  I like the scent too.  Very light and not too overpowering.  Lip balm is a necessity with me and I use it all day as well as applying it before I go to bed.  It leaves my lips very soft and smooth.  The tube lasts for a really long time too.  I just reordered this on Amazon and the price for a pack of four is awesome.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Work outdoors in the mountains every day basically where it&#x27;s very windy most days, so chapped lips are the norm.  This is my favorite stuff for that.  Tingles a bit, and feels very healing.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm out there!</li>
    <li> Very good, very sweet flavor, send a friend a few, are more like</li>
    <li> Some who keep kosher hold that lip balms without a kosher symbol are OK as long as they don&#x27;t contain ingredients explicitly forbidden such as pork, shellfish, and insects. The Pomegranate flavor ingredient list includes contains carmine, an insect-derived red food coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 5 stars because it would be unfair to give less when most people don&#x27;t keep kosher. Enjoy your bug juice ;) This is only in regards to the Pomegranate flavor. I don&#x27;t know about the other flavors.</li>
    <li> My wife turned me on to this product.  Use less than the product in the black tube.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with burts bees and i have been using the product for so long now can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how this pomegranate oil lip balm feels on my lips.  Since using it regularly, my lips have never been healthier.  I have very dry lips that can crack and chap unprovoked.  Despite religiously using medicated lip balms like Carmex, they never ever felt good.  Burt&#x27;s Bees took care of that - i now have smooth, nourished lips thanks to this balm.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite lip balms, though I wish they had larger packs with a better value.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Feels great. Leaves lasting softness on the lips and no greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I really love pomegranate on body washes and other health and beauty products. But I ended up not liking the flavor of this lip balm enough that I threw away the entire tube nearly unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the Bees lip balm products are excellent and I ended up falling in love with the Pink Grapefruit. Since the flavor issue is a personal one, I&#x27;m still going to rate this 5 stars.  It does the job and the pomegranate flavor isn&#x27;t terrible at all - just not to my particular taste.  I happily recommend any of the Bee lip balm line including this one.</li>
    <li> I first bought this lip balm at the checkout at Whole Foods (~$3/tube) and was excited to see it&#x27;s on Amazon (and eligible for free shipping!). Now I can have a tube at work, in my purse, and around the house. I love that the ingredients are natural and that you can&#x27;t feel anything once you put it on. (Brand name ChapStick feels goopy to me.) For the ladies, there&#x27;s a hint of a nice color (like the cap). And it tastes/smells wonderful. Highly recommend for this quantity and price!</li>
    <li> I stopped using lipstick after I&#x27;ve discovered this lip-balm with pomegranate oil. It makes my lips soft and gives it just a hint of color and shine. Awesome product. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> This is some really good lip balm! And I love the flavor and the price was very good, and to get 4 for that price seemed like a no brainer to me. So if you like this brand and flavor get this you won&#x27;t be sorry. I would buy from this seller again..</li>
    <li> This wife loves this stuff, thank you.  Happy wife happy life. would order again. and she recommends this for her friends</li>
    <li> Very nice lip balm that really makes my lips feel soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I have tried the original, but like this soooo much better! Not sticky, not smelly, not gooey...just a light taste and smell. Burt&#x27;s Bees moisturizes perfectly in dry desert heat!</li>
    <li> I bought this 4 pack because I am always using the pomegranate lip balm and buying in bulk here saved me a couple bucks!</li>
    <li> Does the job with a pleasant, mild taste.  Just the right consistency.  Will be buying this again, but it will be a while, lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found good deal like this in any web pages or stores. love this product a lot! must buy.</li>
    <li> I was so upset when I received this. I used to adore Burt&#x27;s Bees and is the only thing I used to use on my lips but now I&#x27;m very disappointed with it. They have changed the formulation and it&#x27;s definitely not as good. At first it was fine for everyday wear but not for making super dry lips moist but then it started to dry out my lips. The more I put on the drier my lips got and I was so disappointed. The flavor is ok. Not my favorite. I thought I would love pomegranate because I love pomegranates but this flavor is not the same as the sweet delicious flavor I know. This is kind of spicyish and weird. It&#x27;s a really hard to describe flavor and it&#x27;s not subtle at all. At first I hated the flavor but the more I wore it the more I got used to it and now I kind of enjoy it. I would continue to wear it if it wasn&#x27;t drying my lips out so bad. BURT&#x27;S BEES BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULATIONS. IT WAS SOOOOO MUCH BETTER!!</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm. It may cost more, but it lasts a lot longer than the cheaper lip balm products. The color looks slightly red, but it does not turn your lips red at all when applied. Great price for a four pack vs. paying individually at a retail store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hydeating and I am in love with the smell. No more chapped lips this winter. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been addicted to this stuff for years. This is my favorite kind, no super strong flavor, goes on nice and smooth with no clumping and lasts longer than other brands. Good deal for 4.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but I wanted to write this one to make people with allergies aware this has castor oil in it.  I used to use all the burts bees products but then they started adding castor oil and since I&#x27;m allergic I can only use the original or the honey.</li>
    <li> Have preferred this to Chap Stick for two reasons. It&#x27;s not as hard of a product so it&#x27;s easier to get a good protective covering on the lips and I like the smell and feel of the pomegranate oil over a non fragranced straight glycerine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, a fragrance would be a negative but it&#x27;s not overwhelming; not by a long shot. It&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s going to linger or even something that a person sitting next to you in a car would be aware of. It&#x27;s pleasant though,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that it&#x27;s offered through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program so I never have to put it on a shopping list and I&#x27;ve always got a lip balm within reach in my house or car.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for this lip balm</li>
    <li> I really like this lip balm.  It imparts a light color, very natural looking, and is very nice on the lips.  I keep one in my purse, one by my bed, and one by my desk.  I like the natural ingredients very much.  You wind up ingesting this, as you would anything on your lips, and I pay attention to those things.  If you care about yourself, this is a good product for you.</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time at the grocery store, and it&#x27;s as much as $3 for a tube.  I bought a 5-pack and spent much less.  Great unit pricing for 5 tubes!</li>
    <li> I bought this by mistake, thinking it was the thicker Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm. It is thinner, and although I liked the pink tint, it wasn&#x27;t thick enough. It doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as other Burt&#x27;s lip balms. I&#x27;d really like the company to cone up with a lil balm that has an SPF that&#x27;s organic. This one got returned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the mango version of this lip balm so I can&#x27;t help but compare the two. The main difference between ingredients is this one contains pomegranate oil instead of mango butter, making it slightly less thick in consistency with a slicker feel . Yet all in all its moisturizing capabilities are the same, which is a good thing; they&#x27;re both my favorite drugstore lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick of balm itself is a reddish color so it does leave behind a very sheer wash of pinkness on your lips. For me, this was a nice surprise, though I&#x27;m sure some dudes out there wouldn&#x27;t be very pleased by that feature! I didn&#x27;t know what to expect in terms of flavor because pomegranate-flavored anything never tastes like the actual fruit. It turned out the scent is strong and tangy, much like wild cherry hard candies...very addicting.</li>
    <li> I have been using Chapstick for many, many years, and generally liked it.  But the past month, my lips dried to a point where Chapstick couldn&#x27;t help them.  I was using it several times a day, and even still, I woke up one morning and my lip had a huge crack in it.  My boyfriend recommended that I try this lip balm.  What a difference.  Within a couple of days, the crack was gone and my lips were feeling WAY better than they ever did with Chapstick.  I bought a couple more to stash in my car and my purse.  I&#x27;m sold on this product for sure.</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of chap stick (that I&#x27;ve ever used) that leaves my lips feeling healthy and refreshed, rather than greasy or coated.  It absorbs, yet heals and replenishes moisture. You can&#x27;t even tell it is there, and when it &amp;#34;wears off&amp;#34;, you don&#x27;t have to add more if you have healthy lips.  I only have to add it a few times a day when my lips start off chapped.  The 4 pack is the cheapest I can find it online.</li>
    <li> where I live is extraordinary dry these days and this can keep my lips a good condition, i will keep use it</li>
    <li> I like this one the best out of all of the flavors I have found.  It is very hard to find in my area, so I am so very glad to find this on Amazon!</li>
    <li> As someone who not only suffers from pretty sever dry/chapped lips, but also someone who LOVES her chapstick, I can only say that there is nothing that works like Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm. I&#x27;ve tried everything from blistex, to dollar store brands, to salon lip balms. Nothing beats BB, and I always come back for more. I would highly recommend this product to anyone! (Don&#x27;t let the price stop you, it lasts longer on your lips and is totally worth it)</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s is the best lip product I have found and I love the pomegranate flavor.  I wouldn&#x27;t have considered purchasing from Amazon, but needed them so it worked out. They shipped quickly so now, I am good for quite some time!</li>
    <li> Very soothing, and I love the pomegranate flavor. Doesn&#x27;t leave lips dry a few minutes later, or burn like chapstick. Cheaper here than local so good deal.</li>
    <li> I sometimes buy these in bulk because they&#x27;re my absolute favorite lip balm. They even add a touch of color, unlike the clear ones.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work with my lips. Worth noting that the original one (without color) works fine with me though. So there must be some ingredient in this that cause the peeling of my lips.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES Burt&#x27;sees lip balm. I ordered these for a Christmas gift. i know she will like them, and the Pomegranite flavor is great! (I kept one for myself)!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many a lip-balm over the years and never found one that *really* works - until Burt&#x27;s Bees. Most lip-balms tend to make my lips more chapped - even a lot of the natural brands. I came across Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate Lip Balm during a road trip several years ago. I was spending some time in the mid-west in dry, summer heat, and my lips were more chapped than they&#x27;d ever been. I ended up picking this up in a store, figuring it was worth a try, and was incredibly pleased when it eased my chapped lips after just a few applications. In about three days time, my lips were completely moist again - despite the fact that I was still enduring the dry heat of the region I was in. I&#x27;ve been a devoted user ever since. Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Pomegranate Lip Balm is a winner!</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products! This lip balm is my favorite. It is a thicker product than Chapstick, so it stays on well and protects my lips. Gentle fruity scent, not over-powering. Thank you, Burt&#x27;s Bees, for such a great product!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees has nothing but fabulous stuff &amp; this is one of them. Goes on very gently and does not feel waxy. Does not leave waxy outlines along edges of lips and just sort of wears away very gently. Keeps lips nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm for super dry weather. I used to work in a ski resort and after I started using this I stopped have chapped lips. Have been a fan of this product ever since. Great flavor, natural ingredients (hope this doesn&#x27;t change) and it leaves a subtle tint in my lips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s lip glosses for decades.  It&#x27;s nice to have a reliable product you can count on!</li>
    <li> I been using this chapstick for a while now since its the best one that helps when my lips are chapped, i just recived mines has a very good scent to it.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped quickly and was what it was suppose to be - it is a great product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is nice, the ingredient list seems healthier. The only thing is it includes no sun-protection. In contrast, Chapstick has an sun-protection factor of 4: That is, if you wear it, you get 4 times as much sun protection compared with wearing nothing.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for your lips.  It doesn&#x27;t have any residue effects at all and it has a slight tint which is amazing.  Hands down favorite lip balm.  I have 10 tubes lying all over the place.  :)</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about Burt&#x27;s Bees?! I have been trying to go more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; in my skincare in general and tried the Pomegranate lip balm as one of my first experiences with Burts Bees. I love it. The balm makes my lips feel great (especially in the harsh winter weather), the scent is wonderful, and there is the oh-so slighest hint of color that makes my lips shiny and healthy looking. I buy it in bulk on the subscribe and save program so that I can keep one in my purse, car and other handy places.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best lipbalm it leaves your lips feeling super soft and smells good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many lipglosses and they all seemed to make my throat tighter and almost close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sine Burt&#x27;s bees I haven&#x27;t tried anything else and I use it religiously. Great product!</li>
    <li> I use this every day.... Makes your lips feel great for hours and with just a touch of color.  Love it...</li>
    <li> I bought these as stocking stuffers for our adult &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; this past Christmas. They expect Santa to leave them something in their stockings yet. This made a good filler.</li>
    <li> I love how smooth this is and how long it lasts.  I did purchase the peppermint as well and do not like that one - it stings.  Pomegranit is the best.</li>
    <li> As always, Burts Bees Rocks!</li>
    <li> Love this. It&#x27;s the best lip balm now with pomegranate!</li>
    <li> I have had the same tube of Pomegranate lip balm for 4 years. That&#x27;s the longest I&#x27;ve had any cosmetic ever! I found it way back in the day and have loved it every since- couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores and frankly I hate the smell of regular lip balms and even burt&#x27;s bees regular scent. This stuff and the mango one are where it&#x27;s at!</li>
    <li> Could not do without it...my lips are extremely dry and would peel without this lip balm.</li>
    <li> I exclusively use Burt&#x27;s Bees pomegranate lip balm.  I used their peppermint version for years, and suddenly became allergic.  I tried the pomegranate, and I have no problem with it.  It keeps my lips soft and stays on a long time. Some balms need to be applied too frequently.  This lasts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this balm for years... It&#x27;s the best lip balm I ever tried. I normally don&#x27;t wear lipstick or lip gloss. This balm moisturizes well without drying out the skin on your lips as other lip balms do if you use them all the time. It even has a subtle hint of color and shine, so I don&#x27;t feel like I need to use lip gloss. Love it!</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star for the price, which I found to be really good for 4 of them, if I were to buy them in the store I would get 1 and a half! I bought this product never having used it before and wanted something that&#x27;s better than Chapstick and was very pleased with it, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure with the pomegranate but its not strong, very mild a definite keeper!!!</li>
    <li> I am a loyal buyer of Burt&#x27;s bees lip series. Both lip balms and shimmers are great from Burt&#x27;s bees. Pomegranate lip balm is great as it gives you a bit color as opposed to plain lip balm. It is very suitable for everyday living and the lip balm effectively protects your lips. In short, love it.</li>
    <li> i bought this as a 4 pack from duane reade and i use the pomegranate one for at home. love how moisturizing it is. burt&#x27;s bees is my to go lip balm so far.</li>
    <li> My favorite chapstick!</li>
    <li> As the Burt&#x27;s Bees Replenishing Lip Balm graces my lips, they immediately are rejuvenated and moist like a stream in early spring after a long winter.  It truly is replenishing.  Not only did it replenish the moisture in my lips, but also my spirits.  I now leave my house with an abundance of confidence due to the lovely shade that this replenishing lip balm casts onto my plump, moist, replenished lips.</li>
    <li> Great for your lips of course once it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees, but this flavor is by far the worst I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I buy it for my wife. She love it so much. I think she will be happy when receive these items.</li>
    <li> I love this Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate lip balm! It is very moisture and last for long. Also the flavor is very pleasant. Highly recommended. I will buy this again if I finish all four of them.</li>
    <li> Another great Burt&#x27;s Bees Product. I love their new flavors of lip balm!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with these natural products</li>
