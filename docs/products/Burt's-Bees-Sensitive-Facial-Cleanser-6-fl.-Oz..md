      <li>/&gt;However I think this may not be a good option for oily skin.</li>
      <li>I used to buy Burt&#x27;s Bees, thinking I was doing something good for both my skin and the environment.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a good job of removing makeup</li>

      <li>Today I was very pleased with my skin.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s great when skin products have many reviews on them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad it does not have an acne-fighting or \\&quot;skin clarifying\\&quot; agent in it, as those tend to antagonize my skin as well.</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>It looks healthy!</li>
      <li>Love how it cleans without drying out your face!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m absolutely pleased with this!</li>

      <li>I have over four months using this product and my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
      <li>it is a great soap free cleanser.</li>
      <li>Price also good. :)</li>
      <li>it smells kind of creamy and grassy</li>
      <li>, I honestly can&#x27;t find anything I dislike about it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, should you buy it?</li>
      <li>Even better than my newest loved cleanser?</li>
      <li>For those who are used to a soap or more drying product, it will take a while to get used to my skin feeling so moisturized immediately after washing without putting on lotion, but it&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>Unlike some of my fellow bzzagents, I actually liked this product.  </li>
      <li>Gently removes make up and smells delicious too.  </li>
      <li>I liked the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of this cleanser while using it -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also prone to breakouts, but my skin has cleared up nicely since switching to this product.</li>
      <li>I did liked the texture</li>
      <li>First, let me tell you that with all the cleansers that I own my cleanser of choice is bar soap so this is a very fair review.  </li>
      <li>Im using up at night , however when I do use this at night it works Great with my clarisonic to give me a deeper clean.</li>
      <li>It feels very oily and the smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant.</li>
      <li>I have been very pleased with the Burt&#x27;s Bees line, I also love their lip balms.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product, good brand and almost all natural</li>
    <li> I seem to have pretty sensitive skin, at least within the last couple years.  I was using Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil soap to wash my face but due to the fact that it&#x27;s a bar soap I think it might have been drying my skin out after all this time.  The skin around my eyes and upper cheek bones are very dry all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this I decided to try a face cream/wash that was not a soap and wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I settled on Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive Facial Cleanser.  I was very excited to try it.  It has now been 24hrs and I have used the cleanser 3 times.  My face is irritated and I am having waves of irritation in different parts of my face like around my mouth, cheek bones, jaw and neck and on the side of my face.  It has a burning, raw and irritated feel to it.  There is no visible rash thank God but patches of dry/flaky skin are appearing in the irritated spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am stopping this product and will be returning it.  I don&#x27;t know what I am allergic to but this is not the first face wash that has done this to me.  Dessert Essence Tea Tree oil face was also had this effect along with a rash.  Not sure what to do now?</li>
    <li> I recieved a full size sample of Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin cleanser through Bzz Agent. This product is very creamy and smooth. It leaves the skin feeling soft. There is no redness or tingling with this product. However, I do agree with other&#x27;s reviews that if you have acne prone skin this probably isn&#x27;t for you. I have been breaking out and have consistently been using this product for 3 weeks and it seems to be getting worse. I would have hoped that it would have helped with break outs but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I was originally excited to be able to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin facial cleanser as a BzzAgent member. I have to say, however, that I was somewhat disappointed in the product. When I first applied the cleanser to my face, I noticed that it had a slight fragrance to it, even though it was supposed to be fragrance free. The odor (which I would say is neither pleasant nor unpleasant) wasn&#x27;t a strong one, but it was present nonetheless.  As I began massaging the product  into my skin as directed, I noticed it had a somewhat \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feel to it which I am unaccustomed to in a facial cleanser. This \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; consistency, also made it more difficult to thoroughly rinse the product from my face. Once I was finished, I was left with the feeling that my face wasn&#x27;t totally clean. The one good thing about this product is that it  did not cause any adverse reactions to my skin, but I have to say I would most likely not purchase it in the future. (I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and I received this product free from BzzAgent.  I received no monetary compensation for my open and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> As a buzzagent I was lucky enough to receive a free sample of this product, along with some coupons to use or give to friends. I have average to sensitive skin which, even though I&#x27;m no longer a teenager, it still likes to break out every once in a while AND be dry at the same time. I&#x27;m usually very skeptical about trying new products as I&#x27;m usually never happy with them and they either make me break out or make my skin dry. For years now I&#x27;ve been using a moisturzing soap that has worked relatively well, however, I MUST use a lotion after washing my face or it&#x27;ll be really tight and dry. After using this product I was pleasently surprised that, although my face felt quite moisturized and NOT dry or in immediate need of a moisturzer, it still felt clean. That tends to be a problem for me, if my skin doesn&#x27;t &#x27;squeak&#x27; it doesn&#x27;t feel clean. Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s made my skin feel both clean and moisturized, and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. For those who are used to a soap or more drying product, it will take a while to get used to my skin feeling so moisturized immediately after washing without putting on lotion, but it&#x27;s a good product I think you&#x27;ll get used to and be happy with...</li>
    <li> I received this product free to try.  My skin is just too oily for a cream cleanser like this though.  I never felt like it left my face clean enough and left a lot of the day&#x27;s makeup and oil on my face after washing.  It did seem to hold true to its sensitive skin claims though.  It didn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation to my face.</li>
    <li> Unlike some of my fellow bzzagents, I actually liked this product.  I too was part of this campaign and received a freebie to try out.  Everyone in my household tried it and we all agreed it worked for us.  It has a smooth, creamy texture which has no fragrance.  I prefer a creamy face wash that doesn&#x27;t foam up as it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin and yes, I do get redness when I find a product that does not do well with my sensitive skin.  I found that it washed off well and left my skin smooth and clean.  Although, I have to say that the first time I used it, it felt a little sticky but after that initial use, there was nothing untoward about it.  Both male and female have tried it here and everyone who tried it liked it, even those without sensitive skin like mine.  A little bit goes a long way and the price can&#x27;t be beat so I would recommend that people at the very least, give it a try.</li>
    <li> Leaves face too greasy. Doesn&#x27;t do a good job of removing makeup</li>
    <li> My face loves this cleanser. It is very gentle and softening. I use it as a mask in the tub and it feels hydrating and clean, My face cleanser for years now</li>
    <li> Works fine on my sensitive skin, but doesn&#x27;t wash away makeup. It&#x27;s moisturizing but feels a bit heavy sometimes. I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this one again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty awesome. I have bad acne underneath my skin. I used this left on my face while i showered and didn&#x27;t break out. Also my face looked smoother and some of the acne subsided. So im going to keep using this maybe my skin will get better. I didnt use a moistruizer after because this product really doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.</li>
    <li> I just got this product through a bzz campaign, and I must say I really like it. My skin tends to get really dry and sensitive in the colder months and whenever the weather changes, but since I&#x27;ve been using this product, my skin never feels dry after washing. I love that it contains mostly natural ingredients also.  All the chemicals in other face washes bother me because I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m putting on my face, so this is a nice change!  It&#x27;s creamy and gentle while also being an effective cleanser.  As long as I supplement with another product for blemishes, I&#x27;m all set!</li>
    <li> I am 34 hrs. Old and have been using Proactive for my moderate adult acne for over a year. Proactive started irritating my skin and not controlling my break outs at all! I Received a sample of the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s sensitive cleanser through BuzzAgents and have been using it for 2 weeks now. It has helped calm my acne and I have seen a lot of improvement since I began using it. My skin is starting to clear up for the first time in a year! I&#x27;m canceling proactive and switching to this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I hated this product.  First of all, this product is super hard to rinse off your face.  It is really thick.  Once finally getting this stuff off my face, my face felt unclean, like there was a film still on it.  It didn&#x27;t leave me refreshed at all.  I will say though, I didn&#x27;t have any skin reaction to this product nor did it cause breakouts.  It just felt gross.  I got this product free to try and it still ended up in the garbage can.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a sample share as a buzz agent.  I was very excited to try this product as I really like Burts Bees products.  This is an ok product, it does leave my skin feeling soft, but I wish it had an acne agent in it.  It has a little smell to it, it&#x27;s not over powering or anything, smells almost like clay or something.  I broke out really bad after using this product for the first week, I&#x27;m assuming it was just cleaning my skin from all the impurities and bringing them to the surface.  My face has cleared up fairly well since then. The texture is pretty good, very smooth.  I do have a bump on face, not sure if it&#x27;s from the product or not.  I&#x27;d say overall it&#x27;s just an ok product.</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent &amp; received a full-size Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Facial cleanser to try &amp; review. My skin definitely felt softer &amp; less dry from using it for several days. As a cream cleanser, it is a little harder to wash off &amp; definitely feels different from other types of cleansers. I actually enjoyed it, until my skin started breaking out in cystic acne. My skin is sensitive to products so I do have to be careful with what I use on my skin as I experience itchiness, redness or dryness. I wish this cleanser had an acne-fighting agent because it would have made it that much better.</li>
    <li> I have this on subscribe and save, and I&#x27;ve used it for years. Anyone with very sensitive skin should try this cleanser. It is not soap. It does not foam, and your skin will not feel squeaky clean. Your skin will be calm and unirritated, though. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have overly-sensitive skin, meaning the majority of sensitive skin products that I have tried--and I have used a number of \\&quot;the best\\&quot; products over the years--cause irritation in one way or another.  This is the first product that I have tried that literally does not cause any of the types of irritation (redness, itching, dryness) that I have experienced with other products...even those recommended by my dermatologists.    The consistency is smooth and creamy, and rinses off easily with gentle rubbing...my skin feels amazing afterwards!  I was reluctant to try yet another product, but I decided to give it a try, and plan on stocking up before others catch on to Burt&#x27;s newest addition.</li>
    <li> I am a Bzz Agent and I received Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive facial cleanser to try and Bzz about.  First, let me tell you that with all the cleansers that I own my cleanser of choice is bar soap so this is a very fair review.  I have had oily skin for my entire life so feeling clean and avoiding shine is my goal and I was shocked at how well this cleanser worked.  I used it last night and it is soap and fragrance free.  It left my skin feeling soft and after drying my face I used the daily moisturizing cream which I liked as well.  Went on easy and did not feel heavy.  Today I was very pleased with my skin.  Not having to run for the powder constantly which is all I would ask for in my skin care.  I have been very pleased with the Burt&#x27;s Bees line, I also love their lip balms.</li>
    <li> My first complaint about this product is the smell of the cleanser!  Phew, I know there have to be some natural products they can put in to make the smell a bit better.  My second complaint it the packaging.  Whenever I just try to squeeze out just a little, enough comes out to wash my whole body!!!  For the price I wouldn&#x27;t want to waste that much (even though I did receive this as a sample.  The plus sides:  My skin did not react to the cleanser or the moisturizer.  In fact, I haven&#x27;t had a break out since I started using it.  I just have to decide if that&#x27;s worth the smell and waste of product.</li>
    <li> I received this product along with the moisturizer through BuzzAgent to try and share my opinion. I was really excited to get it because I love Burt Bee&#x27;s products. After giving it two weeks of use however, I had to call it quits. This is just not a good product. My first complaint is that the face wash is supposed to be sent free but yet smells like school glue and I found that bothersome. It seems to be thick coming out of the tube but did not cleanse my face at all, leaving a residue behind with the make up it failed to remove. Also the moisturizer does not soak in to your skin but only stays on top of it until it eventually dries. After a two weeks and a few break outs I just can&#x27;t continue to use this product. I really did want to like it and I hope that they can improve on it for the future, but I think I will be sticking to my usual face wash and moisturizer for now. Now, Burt Bee&#x27;s lip balms and hand lotions? I will always be a loyal fan of those.</li>
    <li> I am BzzAgent and recieved the face wash and moisturizer for this line a few weeks back. I LOVE the face wash. It doesn&#x27;t take your make off well (but I use a eye make-up remover before hand anyways)but it leaves my skin so soft and clean. I have very sensitive skin that dries out and gets unbalanced easily. This product doesnt dry my skin out, doesnt leave it red and doesnt cost a TON of money. Good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this instead of receiving as a sample or trial, and I will continue to buy it! This product is great for my very sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to getting too dry after using most cleansers. This thick, creamy wash gently removes dirt and most make-up and leaves my skin still feeling soft. I&#x27;m very glad it does not have an acne-fighting or \\&quot;skin clarifying\\&quot; agent in it, as those tend to antagonize my skin as well. This is truly a sensitive skin cleanser - it cleans without stripping, stinging, or burning, and still leaves skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using a separate eye make-up remover, though. While this cleanser did remove most of my light eye make-up, eyeliner and mascara (particularly waterproof versions) seem to be a challenge for it. I&#x27;ve woken up with more under my eyes in the morning than I thought was there at night after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great bargain for those of us who have delicate, sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser on and off for a few months. I really want to like it due to it&#x27;s great ingredients and the fact that it is by no means harsh, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s a little lackluster in the actual cleaning department. I use it with my clarisonic and it seems to make up for it&#x27;s less than brilliant cleansing properties.  If you have ultra sensitive skin though, this may be the route for you.  I recommend it as morning wash rather than a night wash though, since without my clarisonic and good scrubbing I have a hard time getting it to take any of my mineral makeup off at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Ingredients, gentleness, moisture, best for morning face cleanse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not much makeup removal</li>
    <li> I bought this to try out at my local drug-store on a whim because it was a clearance item at about half of the amazon-listed price. I have relatively dry and sensitive skin, and as such I was attracted by the bottle&#x27;s claim that it is \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; facial cleanser.  Positives: relatively environmentally friendly (the plastic container states that it is made with 50% post-consumer content), non-comedogenic, soap free, hypo-allergenic, allergy-tested, no animal testing, no parabens, no petro-chemicals, presumably designed for sensitive skin in need of moisture--and indeed, my skin, which gets red and irritated easily if, for example, I use a regular bar of soap and even some facial soaps, did not get irritated or dry out after using this product--BUT--see below  Negatives: It is relatively dense and thick. It purports to be \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;, but there IS a smell to it, a non-offensive and non-pungent smell, but nevertheless, a smell that I do not find pleasant. (I cannot be more specific, because it does not smell like any more familiar smell).  At the bottom of the back of the bottle, in small print, it says \\&quot;99.0 percent natural\\&quot; which is pretty good, I suppose, but I do wonder what the 1 percent non-natural ingredients are, and, not being a chemist, I cannot tell from reading the ingredients. As it is intended to moisturize your skin, it leaves a bit of a mositure film on your skin, even after you rinse the thick cream off, which I think some reviewers have misconstrued. Some readers said they found that it was hard to rinse off --but I think that this moisture film is by design--ie I believe that this product is intended to leave your skin with a layer of moisture and not strip it of natural oils. Finally, I personally do prefer facial products that sud and foam, and this one definitely does not.  All in all, I would not recommend this product to a friend because of the smell, the lingering moisture film which I find unpleasant, and the high price. I will not buy itagain.</li>
    <li> My husband and I were both disappointed with this face wash. I use very little make up (tinted moisturizer, some powder, mascara) and after washing my face with this product my skin actually felt greasier. I had to use multiple cotton swabs loaded with toner for my skin to feel and look clean afterwards. my husband - who obviously doesn&#x27;t wear make up :) - broke out and felt the same greasiness after using it, too. we stuck with the face wash (and the tons of cotton swabs/toner routine) because we couldn&#x27;t convince ourselves to throw away $10... but we can&#x27;t wait until we run out so we can buy something else!</li>
    <li> Product was as described and came quickly. I love this face wash - leaves me feeling clean without stripping my skin dry.</li>
    <li> i am a Bzzagent and was excited to recieve this product. i was suprised that The Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin products are all natural and made from cotton extract. My face is very sensitive and I normally have red skin on my forehead as well as on my cheeks and everything breaks me out. These products do not cause my face to turn red at all. My skin is soft and not dry or oily after using this product. i also loved the smell of it . the downside it didnt take my makeup off :(</li>
    <li> I cannot get over how great this cleanser smells - not to mention how great it works! My skin, which is extremely sensitive, feels so silky after using Burts Bees Sensitive Skin facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> In general, I&#x27;m a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and I have sensitive skin, so I was really excited to try this product as a BzzAgent (I received a complimentary sample as a BzzAgent).  The Natural Skin Solutions Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser is a cream cleanser - it&#x27;s soap-free and non-foaming.  Since I normally use a foaming cleanser (Olay Sensitive), this was a little hard to get used to.  The texture of the product is nice and creamy, and it&#x27;s fragrance free.  It goes on nicely, but it seems hard to rinse.  Since using it, I notice I&#x27;m getting more frequent breakouts.  I can&#x27;t say for certain that it&#x27;s related to this cleanser, but the breakouts began within a couple of days of beginning to use it.</li>
    <li> All my life I&#x27;ve struggled with combination acne-prone skin.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products that worked, but only temporarily.  I loved this fragrance free sensitive skin product from Burt&#x27;s Bees from the first use; however, I wanted to wait to use it for a full month before reviewing.  After a month, I can truly say I can&#x27;t imagine changing to any other product.  My acne is under control. My oily skin is much more under control.  Even more amazing, I think my skin looks more beautiful without make-up now!  I&#x27;ve been using it in combination with their sensitive skin night cream (using day and night).  Their day cream wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me and left my skin feeling irritated, but once I exchanged it for the night cream, my life was changed!  I did have one break-out during my most hormonal time of the month, but it was nothing compared to usual (or compared to what happened to my back and shoulders).  I also love the equivalent eye cream and am now looking into buying more of their fragrance-free products for the rest of my body!</li>
    <li> First I have sensitive skin, not too dry not too oily. But this product is so sticky which made my face even more oily than washing my face before. No bubble but not clean neither.</li>
    <li> Personally this is the product for you if you have skin issues (peeling, redness, etc). It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser and it&#x27;s not made for scrubbing your skin. Before you use it, you should remove any makeup. This cleanser does smell a bit like glue but I&#x27;ve gotten use to it. I have peeling and redness around my lips. This product is not irritating to my lips as the other products such as Mary Kay facial scrubs or Clean and Clear (unless I have a flare up). Overall this product has been the best one I have tried out so far.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, makes my face so clear and smooth.</li>
    <li> Have suffered not only with a sensitive skin but with acne all my teen years and adult life as well, am very wary of any product that touches my face. So as a BzzAgent when I got the cleanser I did not think twice, as Burt&#x27;s Bees is synonymous with natural and not so harsh ingredients. I love putting makeup and due to my acne scars my foundation goes on really thick, I need to wash my face at least twice before it feels cleans. But with this cleanser, a required very little and it cleaned my face and it did not make it feel dry. The skin is still soft and feels clean.</li>
    <li> I was able to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser as part of a BzzCampaign.  I have always been a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees and also natural products.  As a person with psoriasis, though in remission, I have to be careful with what I put on my skin.  I was confident using this product.  My skin is left feeling clean, soft and smooth, but as I was using it it just didn&#x27;t FEEL like a cleanser.  I am missing the lather of a cleanser.  It may just take some getting used to.  I love the scent.  It is light and almost smells like oatmeal.  I have been satisfied with the product, but it isn&#x27;t my new \\&quot;go to.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> After almost a month of using Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial cleanser and moisturizer for sensitive skin, I can truly say that my skin has changed for the better.  These products leave my skin fresh, clean and moisturized unlike other products that actually cause breakouts and irritation.  My skin feels and looks softer.  The scent is light and clean and the natural ingredients make me feel like I&#x27;m doing something healthy for my skin.  I am now a big fan of the Burt&#x27;s Bees line for sensitive skin.  These products were sent to me for evaluation through a BZZ Campaign.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is all-natural, which is the best part. It&#x27;s texture is also very thick and creamy, so you only need a tiny dab to clean your face. The 6 ounces will last a long time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK...just feels like I am rubbing super thick sour cream on my face.  I probably won&#x27;t buy again.  It is a bit drying, even though it&#x27;s not supposed to be.  I don&#x27;t solely use this product, I alternate it with my expensive wash H2T acne, or H2T gentle.</li>
    <li> Burts Bee&#x27;s Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser  I just got this product to try for free as part of a Bzz Campaign and I really like it. I used it in the shower and I loved the creamy formula. It went on smoothly and smelled really good, kinda like a soft perfume. The thing that I think I liked the best is that after I washed my face it didn&#x27;t feel dry or tight. I liked how smooth it felt. I like that this cleanser comes from a company I can trust and one that cares so much about the environment.</li>
    <li> I am also a Bzz Agent and just received my kit.  I really like the texture and how smoothly this product goes on.  However, it did not take off my makeup.  I used a white face towel to dry my face &amp; all my makeup was on the towel.  I was pretty disappointed since I really washed my face well.  I also don&#x27;t care for the smell, although I&#x27;m pretty sure it is unscented.  It still has a stale kind of smell to me.  If my makeup continues to not come off, I will not purchase this product in the future, nor will I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am a Bzz Agent and received a full size cleanser and daily moisturizer sample to try.  I have been using this product for 1 week now and wanted to fall in love with it from the beginning.  I have dry, sensitive, 31-year old skin.  I love creamy cleansers that don&#x27;t foam.  Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin cleanser is very thick, creamy and non-foaming.  Each time I have used it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels good while its on my face, but as soon as I wash it off, my face immediately feels very dry.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with irritation and that part is great.  Each time I have followed the cleanser with the Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin daily moisturizer.  Again, this is a good, non-irritating product that is fragrance-free, but it is lacking in good, solid moisture.  It feels okay at first, but rapidly disipates.  I need a much heavier moisturizer with this.  I wanted to love both products together, but for my dry, sensitive skin, I just neeed more.</li>
    <li> I was given this product by being a bzz agent. Ive been given lots of stuff to test, but THIS just hit the jackpot, my overly sensitive skin breaks out and turns red over most creams, or its just way to oily for my skin. My skin felt soft, and smooth and its just amazing. I have definately changed from my expensive brand to this its easy on the pocketbook and still makes my skin feel softer than that other stuff :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently on topical acne meds so my skin is super sensitive and I cannot use my usual glycolic cleanser. I received Burts Bees sensitive Facial Cleaser because I&#x27;m a BzzAgent, and it came at the right time. I needed a moisturizing cleanser and I prefer using natural products on my skin and hair when possible. I didn&#x27;t experience burning like I did with the Neutrogena Naturals products, and being on a differin/duac cocktail my skin tends to need the extra moisture that this provides. I haven&#x27;t use it as to remove makeup however, it does cleanse the residual makeup left after I use a makeup removal wipe. Doesn&#x27;t lather up, and because its soap free don&#x27;t expect that tight \\&quot;clean\\&quot; (stripped) feeling you&#x27;d feel with cleansers that contain soap. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this for someone who needs a cleanser that moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t need that stripped feeling that comes with using soap based products.</li>
    <li> The face wash I was using regularly worked pretty well but was SO expensive I just can&#x27;t continue paying that much. I used another product recommended by a friend along with a natural face mask one night that she said helped with acne. A few days later, my face looked worse than it ever had. I have very sensitive skin with stress breakouts on my chin and some blackheads that appear on the pores of my cheeks. My face became very dry and had a slight rash. I didn&#x27;t really know what to do so I decided to get a very gentle product and use as little on my face as possible for a while. So far, the combination of this face cleanser, a clean pillow case each night, and using all natural/organic shampoo and very little makeup has made my face better than it has ever been. I think people with breakouts tend to fuss over their face more, which does more harm than good. This cleanser feels wonderful when I put it on, and my face feels nice and moisturized after I wash it. I use very little face lotion in the morning and am considering using more BB products now that this cleanser has worked so well. I may try the toner and night-time face lotion next. I have not had one breakout since this product and that in itself is a true miracle. It has also helped a lot with the redness I get on my forehead and chin. I use coconut oil to remove eye-makeup, and this cleanser removes my face powder and blush very well off my face. A few people mentioned they fear this will get discontinued...I really hope it does not! Five stars!</li>
    <li> I LOVE burts bees products, and based on the reviews, I was excited to try this product. So this morning I showered and used this facial scrub to clean my face. I made sure to rinse it off really well. But the rest of the day it left residue on my face that showed under my makeup! Now at the end of the day my skin is so dry and rough it&#x27;s peeling and scaly looking! I know I rinsed it off really well, so I&#x27;m not sure why it did this. I&#x27;m returning it tomorrow. What a bummer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am a buzz agent I recieved this product to sample and review.The Sensitive daily Moisturizer nourished my skin all day long. This product made my skin look healthy and did not cause redness. Most moisturizers cause me to break out and clog my pores. This product did not cause me to break out because it is Non-Comedogenic. I like the way the natural ingredients made my skin feel. The best part of these products is that they are clinically proven to work and they are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> (Another BzzAgent, I was sent a sample of this cleanser to try.)  I was very excited to try out this new sensitive skin care line from Burt&#x27;s Bees. I have used Burt&#x27;s products in the past and really liked the quality, plus I have pretty sensitive skin, so this seemed right up my alley.  This cleanser is very rich and creamy. I did not experience any sensitivity issues or irritation at all while using it. It does a great job of removing makeup and dirt at the end of the day. Only drawback is that it may be a little to rich and moisturizing for my oily/combination skin.</li>
    <li> I received this to try through Bzz Agent.  I liked a lot of things about it, but did not love it.  It is \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot;, but still has a faint smell that is kind of pleasant.  I think it must be the cotton.  The cleanser is a little thick and hard to get off my skin, but my skin feels great after I am done washing my face.  It leaves my skin feeling very clean and moisturized.  I&#x27;m just not sure how much of my makeup it actually removes.  I use white washcloths and feel like there is quite a bit on the cloth after I have washed my face.  I don&#x27;t want to spend that much time getting cleanser off my face if it doesn&#x27;t remove my makeup.</li>
    <li> So far good for my extremely sensitive and dry skin.  I live in the California High Desert &amp; needed a product that would not dry my skin more. This works.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser, use the back portion do not feel greasy, stick with hope to have better results, make my skin look healthier</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I decided to try this.  I am 33, still suffer from acne, and it&#x27;s been tough to keep under control even with prescriptions (I have tried EVERYTHING).  I wanted a cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry my face out, because I felt like it was just irritated and making breakouts worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this does the trick!  I have used Purpose cleanser for years and loved it overall, but would still feel dry afterwards.  This is the first cleanser that hasn&#x27;t had me running to my moisturizer!  It almost feels like a film is left behind, but I think it&#x27;s just not stripping my skin of its oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off because I really dislike the smell, it sort of reminds me of glue or paint.  But I will put up with it because the cleanser is so lovely.  It isn&#x27;t great at taking off eyeliner but seems to remove everything else just fine.  My face seems to have calmed down a lot since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
    <li> I am a skin product and makeup junkie and have fair, &#x27;normal&#x27; in terms of oiliness, sensitive skin (get rashes easily, blush, prone to breakouts and reactions to lots of things, even &#x27;natural&#x27; substances).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used most of Burts Bees other cleansers, as well as Perricone, Bliss, Shiseido, Korres, Boscia, jojoba oil, dove soap, and many other drug store brands where the ingredients looked good to me, and this cleanser is finally one I am using regularly and happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this to my skin as a makeup remover at night. I apply and gently massage it in, then I usually try to let it soak in, for several minutes, then remove with a warm wet washcloth. I usually follow up with witch hazel rose water as a toner, then spray some Evian water on. Then I let my skin settle down before applying any other products (at least half an hour --just my preference and seems to reduce reactivity.)</li>
    <li> I got Burt&#x27;s bees a nd I liked the product because it did not dry my skin or irritate it. Now the product is done and I will not continue using it because it didn&#x27;t remove any of my blackheads. I have moved on to using another brand of cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with adult acne for years and after I had a baby it got much worse. I tried everything to clear it up. I read about oil cleansing so I thought I would try this because its oil based. It is amazing! It leaves my skin soft and smooth and I rarely ever get a pimple anymore. I use this and then slather a couple drops of argan oil. My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I used to use Velocity by MK and it was okay but I wanted to try something more natural. Since using this product (and the moisturizing cream) my skin has felt so smooth, soft, and it looks great! It is a cream base so it does not lather like other facial cleansers but that is just something to get used to. It is a very gentle cleanser and has no scent. I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very gentle on my previously burned skin.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great! I use for night time because it smells so soft and lovely.</li>
    <li> Although unscented, it smells like beer to me</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser, I was using a much more expensive cleanser before this and it was working but the price was really bothering me for something I am rinsing down the drain.  I use a clarisonic and I have dry/ combination skin very dry skin on my forhead and cheeks and large congested pores on my nose. I really wanted a soap free cleanser because I just love how my skin feels without using soap. I do however have a deeper cleanser I use about once a week before I use a face mask just to ensure I get any residue off my face and im starting fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*scent- it is fragrance free which means no added fragrance the natural scent of this product isnt great but it isnt bad at all and it is very comforting to me for some reason. It isnt strong and it does not linger once you rinse it off you are good!&lt;br /&gt;*cleansing ability- this cleans great without leaving your skin tight or dry. I use this in the morning with just my hands to wash off my night treatments and I love how soft my skin is after. I have another cleanser Im using up at night , however when I do use this at night it works Great with my clarisonic to give me a deeper clean. I use the burts bees makeup remover wipes first if I have makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*overall- it is a great soap free cleanser. Does not irritate my skin, I am absolutely in love with it! Will repurchase again and again! Also It helped clear up some tiny bumps I was getting on my forhead!</li>
    <li> I received Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive facial cleanser and daily moisturizing cream for review as a member of Buzzagent.  I was very surprised.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin products are all natural and made from cotton extract.  My face is very sensitive and I normally have red skin on my forehead as well as on my cheeks.  These products do not cause my face to turn red at all.  My skin is soft and not dry or oily after using this product.</li>
    <li> It is the best product for sensitive skin Treat the more expensive products and none worked for me</li>
    <li> I received this product free as a BuzzAgent. I used it for 3 days and had to quit using it. It made my skin feel unclean and dull. After the second day my skin started becoming irritated and itchy. I like that the ingredients are natural and that it is made by a brand that I love, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I noticed it didn&#x27;t remove makeup as well as other face cleansers. Overall this was a huge letdown.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews on products ever, but I had to write one after using this product.  I have dry oily combo skin with mild acne once in a while and this cleanser is by far the best I have ever tried and I have tried literally like 100 different cleansers.  My skin was sooo dry from the cold weather and I tried thousand different moisturizers thinking that was the issue, but one day I came across this and thought I would give it a try.  After the first use, my skin was not dry or tight not one bit!!!  After about a weak my skin was still moisturized and I needed only very little moisturizer on my face and some days I wouldnt use any!!!  I can remember the last time I did not use lotion on my face before using this facewash.  My skin tone has evened out dramatically, my skin looks and feels smooth.  I get sooo many compliments on my skin now and since using this facewash I have not had one pimple!!! Seriously, not one!!  Also, my skin has barely been oily and it stays free of oil all day!! I have stocked up on this facewash in hopes that it never is discontinued.  If you have not tried it do it.  Give it a week or two and you will see awesome results.  People complain about the texture, but its what dry skin needs!! A non lathering cream that does not strip your skin and this facewash definitely does not clog pores!!!!  This is by far the best cleanser I have ever tried and I used to be addicted to foaming/gel cleansers for that squeaky clean feeling, but all that did was make my skin dry and break me out....so try this and you will not be sorry!!!</li>
    <li> Cleans your skin while not drying out. Even though I have adult acne, I discovered that most comparably priced &amp;#34;acne fighting&amp;#34; face washes dried out my skin and made the problem worse. This product isn&#x27;t directly targeting acne, but since it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, the acne situation has improved. Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
    <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the face cleanser, I don&#x27;t like how it doesn&#x27;t foam or lather for a clean feel! It left my face feeling oily as well. I don&#x27;t this I will buy this product again, it&#x27;s not for me!</li>
    <li> This is the worst cleanser I have used so far. Its like applying cream on your face &amp; then trying to wash it away with water. It feels very sticky on the skin, there is no froth what so ever and worst of all my makeup/dirt does not go away after using this cleanser. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and it moisturizes my skin. I have combination skin, and this treats my skin very nicely. I use it as my every day wash</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s great when skin products have many reviews on them. We all have quite different skin. Some of us have dry, some oily, some sensitive, some tough. What works well for person A might be awesome for me and horrific for someone else. So while I&#x27;m happy to see that some others find this is just right for them, I think it&#x27;s also important for me to chime in and say this is far from great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 45 and have quite sensitive skin. I haven&#x27;t worn makeup in twenty years so it&#x27;s important to me that my skin is healthy and fresh looking. People are seeing just my skin - not layers of cover over it. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products over the years to keep my skin healthy. Several of my friends recommended this Burt&#x27;s Bees product to me. For their skin, it works great. For me, it just doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin goes on like a white thick lotion, almost like hair conditioner. It&#x27;s more a cream than a foaming substance. I don&#x27;t mind that - but I do mind that it doesn&#x27;t then seem to rinse off. It sticks on the face and coats it. Maybe I&#x27;m more aware of this since I don&#x27;t wear makeup or use lotion. I can feel it when something is on my skin. That something is then clogging my pores and such. To me, I want a cleanser to clean, period. I don&#x27;t want anything left behind. If I then choose to use a lotion or cream, I&#x27;d want to choose that lotion to be the best possible for the situation. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be stuck with this cleanser still stuck on my face filling in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m curious, for that aspect, if others simply don&#x27;t notice that coating left behind, or if they notice and they like it. Do they think of this cleanser as a cleanser-plus-lotion? Or a cleanser-plus-protectant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me that would be bad enough, but it does also cause my skin to tingle and turn red. So whether or not it left that layer on my skin, it still would come off my list because of the red-face issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly others like the product and that&#x27;s good for their skin.

    <li> Rich and smooth; love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am trying to switch over to more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; beauty products. I do not think this does a good job of cleansing off dirt and makeup. I use it after I already use the Burts Bees makeup remover wipes. I think I will just stick to their baby products. I love that Amazon has subscribe &amp; save for this line though.</li>
    <li> I like using this as a light wash if my skin is inflamed, but it doesn&#x27;t get deep enough for me into my skin to help with much acne. Id suggest getting a face wash with some sort of pore scrub. I use St. Ive&#x27;s Aricot pore scrub along with 2 other products and I haven&#x27;t had acne in almost a year.</li>
    <li> Have Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream and love it, so bought this. So far, haven&#x27;t made me break out, which is a good sign. Will probably keep buying it when I finish this one.</li>
    <li> Got for daughter she loves it</li>
    <li> When I stick to a regular routine of burts bees face products my skin looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old daughter was beginning to break out.  She uses this and it&#x27;s helping her teenage acne.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Gave me cysts and didn&#x27;t clean my pores.  Threw it out.  And I own many BB products....but this one stinks.  Literally.</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin, fair price for quality of product. Good for people looking for gentle cleanser this is not a deep cleaner but good for me twice a day</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use it if you have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most face washes, but not this one.</li>
    <li> I used this about a year ago and hated it, I felt like I needed to scrape the stuff off and then I was left with a dirty feeling face anyway; so what was the point in even rubbing this goo all over myself? Stuck it straight under the sink with the rest of my \\&quot;oh s*** waist of money products.\\&quot;    I ran out of my cleanser recently and had no choice but to go into the depths of my bathroom cabinet, where I found the old Burts Bee&#x27;s Face Glue, awesome, but I was sure as hell not going to bed with my Los Angeles abused face. So I lathered up my Clarisonic Brush with the Glue and you know, it actually did a pretty dang good job and left my face feeling really surprisingly nice? and moisturized? Even better than my newest loved cleanser? hmmm....    So, if you have the expensive brush, get this product, if you don&#x27;t have the brush, I&#x27;d stay away from this pore clogger. Also a good tip, after you rinse your face, use a wet and warm face towel to gently go over your face, it&#x27;ll remove whatever the water left and you will feel pretty dang smooth.    Hope that helps someone out there! ;)</li>
    <li> I still breakout with this and everything else I try :( BUT my teenage son uses this now and it works great for him!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and have used Burt&#x27;s products for several years now.  This facial cleanser does a great job, does not dry out my skin but also is not oily.</li>
    <li> I have been used many organic brand items so far. This one was very disappointing. I can not remove my make up with this cleanser when I remove my make up with this one, it still remain make up on my face. Also I don&#x27;t feel like I washed my face at all. Yes, I know. It is a cleanser for sensitive skin but maybe this is too sensitive. It doesn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
    <li> I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this facial cleanser doesn&#x27;t do it for me. It feels too thick and creamy, and after I wash it off, my face still feels greasy. And, I get minor breakouts when I use it. I keep it in the shower and still use it once in a while because I feel I need to use it up since I paid for it and don&#x27;t think I can return it. But I am not at all happy with it. I prefer a clear gel cleanser. The only thing I do like about this Burt&#x27;s Bees cleanser is that it is basically fragrance-free. I can&#x27;t stand products that are heavily perfumed.</li>
    <li> a little dry after washing face</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Great facial cleanser!  No frag, safe ingredients, and is kind to my aging face.  Definitely a winner.</li>
    <li> I like this Burt&#x27;s Bees brand sensitive facial cleanser quite a bit. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry or oily, and it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate too much in my opinion. Good bang for the buck too! Shipments of this item have consistently arrived to my home on time. 4 out of 5 stars, DERDUHRDERRRR!</li>
    <li> My face loves this cleanser. It&#x27;s very gentle and softening. I use it as a mask in the tub and it feels hydrating and clean. My fav cleanser for years now.</li>
    <li> What I like the most about this is that it cleanses without irritating , the tight dry feeling that you usually get with other kind of face cleansers it doest happen with this facial cleanser, it has no parfume or harsh chemicals, I like  it a lot, oit makes no foam, it&#x27; s lime a cream so it feels a little weird to wash your face  with something that doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s well  worth it.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (which is a miracle for me) and it&#x27;s nice and gentle going on. Definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my aging skin. My face feels smooth and clean, but not dry after use.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this daily. Cleans gently without any sting, and with no fragrance. We think it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> So far this is the Best product I found on the market.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to be oily. This lotion is simply wonderful. I feel confident using this knowing it is such a natural product. My face is soft and even without extra oil.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> No heavy smell, rinses off quickly, no residue.  Does not leave my skin dry. This has helped clear up breakouts quite well.</li>
    <li> I was looking to get the &#x27;Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser&#x27; to replace my &#x27;Orange Essence Cleanser&#x27; the latter of which I ran out of and found to be too drying for repurchase. However the store was out of the Intense Hydration, so I picked this up instead.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase! This product is soft and creamy and isn&#x27;t a soap (Which I&#x27;m fond of in cleansers) it smells kind of creamy and grassy, I was worried it wasn&#x27;t going to do a good job of make-up removal, but I was proven wrong, it does an excellent job of removing makeup without drying or irritating my skin at all, it cleans my face and doesn&#x27;t feel like any residue is left on my skin, this product certainly does live up to it&#x27;s name and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, I honestly can&#x27;t find anything I dislike about it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, should you buy it? I would say yes, it&#x27;s a very good quality cleanser and you don&#x27;t have to drop a lot of money for it. Would I buy it again? I think so, I would like to give the &#x27;Intense Hydration Cleanser&#x27; a try sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Non-drying&lt;br /&gt;-Non-irritating&lt;br /&gt;-Effectively removes make-up&lt;br /&gt;-Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;-Has caused no breakouts at all.&lt;br /&gt;-Good product for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;-Refreshing and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;-Long lasting, I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 months and I use it daily, still no sign of running out.</li>
    <li> Most products make my face break out. This cleans off the extra oil and is gentle on my skin. I don&#x27;t wear make up, so there isn&#x27;t much that needs to be washed off.. but it works perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Good, non irritating or drying cleanser.</li>
    <li> All expectations were met. Good product.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has a blemish problem and this product works really well and we like that it all natural.</li>
    <li> Found this on Amazon at a great price. Since I was buying the body wash which I can&#x27;t get in my local CVS or Whole Foods any longer, I stocked up on both products.  Great product too, no harsh chemicals, nothing bad in it. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a bzz agent and recieved this product to try out.  I really liked it, I thought it cleaned my skin very well.  It leaves it soft.  It worked well at cleaning my skin, the downside was it says it removes makeup and it really didnt remove my eyeliner.  Other then that it worked great.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Solutions for Sensitive Skin is a great skincare line for people who suffer from overly sensitive skin. I&#x27;m a Bzz Agent and I received the cleanser and moisturizer as a part of the Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Solutions for Sensitive Skin campaign. The cleanser surprisingly left my skin soft, smooth, and without the usual tightness which happens with most cleansers I use. The moisturizer also protects my skin from dryness. I recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin line for all people who endure dry, sensitive on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I also received this product as a freebie to try for bzz agent.  I must say, that it leaves my skin feeling very fresh and clean- and does not over dry like many skin cleansers do. It is soap free and It is one of the softest feeling cleansers I have ever used.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has issues with soap and or facial cleansers.  Nice products from a great company!</li>
    <li> I have combination/sensitive/eczema-prone skin and was given a full sized sample of this product as I am a Bzz Agent (like many here I see!) - approx cost $9.00 at most drug stores.  I liked the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of this cleanser while using it - my skin never got dry, red or irritated, but I always noticed moderate traces of make up still needing to be removed with toner afterward.  However, I got better results if I used the cleanser with a gentle wash cloth (i.e. no evidence of gunk left on the cotton pad with toner).  I also had the opportunity to try the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin facial moisturizer which came in a convenient pump, absorbed easily, and didn&#x27;t irritate my face or cause me to break out, but I always noted some \\&quot;flaking\\&quot; of my skin in the a.m. which I guess means it just isn&#x27;t moisturizing \\&quot;enough\\&quot; for my skin needs.  All-in-all, I am a pretty loyal BB customer, but I&#x27;m not sure that these will be a regular addition to my daily skin-care routine.</li>
    <li> Since started using this product, my skin is seriously improved. Turns out soap makes me break-out, so I&#x27;m now a soap-free gal.</li>
    <li> This face wash is definitely very moisturizing but it is not great at removing makeup. I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and would not recommend it to anyone that wears makeup and wants to use this at night before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used non-soap cleansers before with varying results but this one was the most disappointing. While the wash itself is decent, I can only use it on already &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; skin. The first time I used it, I thought it felt nice and creamy but after rinsing it off I noticed that my skin felt very greasy and there was a noticeable residue I could feel on my face. Then I followed with my usual witch hazel toner and noticed lots of makeup on the cotton round so I knew this did not do a good job of actually cleansing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too late for me to return it but I am keeping this in the shower since I know it will be fine in there. I use this only after washing with another tea tree cleanser since that makes my skin feel dry. This does leave it feeling nice and moist which is nice, but only in certain circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> I love this product for sensitive skin and it did not make me break out. Package arrived cracked open but seller is working to refund my money and it seems simple! I will still buy this product at the store!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product as it doesn&#x27;t clean the face at all. It merely smear make up and dirt around. After washing, I could still wipe a lot of dirt off my face. After a week, I started to have break outs as a result of this product!</li>
    <li> I just love this it&#x27;s great for sensitive face use cleans your face very well</li>
    <li> Awesome face wash for sensitive skin to control acne, best product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I switched from the Collective Wellbeing cleanser to this one, and I love it. I have very sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t have any problems with this cleanser. It has basically no smell, which is great, and it&#x27;s creamy enough. I hope they never change the formula!  Until then, I&#x27;m a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> This leaves my face with a filmy residue.  I did not like it at all!</li>
    <li> I like this face cleanser especially with my dry sensitive skin. Ingredients are mostly natural and safe, no crazy chemicals. I feel like when i try to squeeze some out I always get too much product out. My only issue with this is it makes my face feel slimy afterwards. I spend a good 5 minutes rinsing/rubbing my face because I feel like I still have some on my face. It&#x27;s not quite a moisturized feeling, literally just feels like residue is still on my face.</li>
    <li> I have had the privilege to try this Facial Cleanser for my Person opinion provided by BzzAgent.com. I was so excited to get my Kit to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Products. I have never Tried any of Burt&#x27;s Bees Products so this review was even more exciting for me. I have extremely sensitive skin so I&#x27;m very picky on what products I use on my face. The day the Burt&#x27;s Bees Box arrived I used the Facial cleanser. I have used it now for a week. So far I have noticed softer skin, less redness and my skin just looks better. My pores are smaller and the skin looks brighter. Overall, I am very pleased with the products in the Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Solutions for Sensitive Skin line. I found Burt&#x27;s Bees to offer high quality products at reasonable prices.</li>
    <li> Bought for girlfriend, works awesome, way cheaper than in store!&lt;br /&gt;Watch the netflix documentary.</li>
    <li> Been using this cleaner for years now. I started when I got pregnant with my first.  It&#x27;s great on sensitive skin and it takes my make-up off fairly decent.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really deep clean and get all my makeup off.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.  Product does not have any &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34;.  Very creamy.  Cleans skin great.  Very nice, very subtle smell. Product did not cause any breakouts</li>
    <li> This may be okay for sensitive skin, but it wreaked havoc on my sensitive and acne-prone skin. Broke me out like mad. I should&#x27;ve checked the ingredients before buying - after entering them on CosDNA it&#x27;s no surprise it broke me out. Cetyl Alcohol, Cera Alba, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cocos Nucifera Oil, Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter, and the preservative Benzoic Acid are all known to cause acne in some people. So acne-prone humans, beware of this product if you&#x27;re sensitive to any of these!</li>
    <li> In our house we LOVE all things Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s but this cleanser feels greasy and waxy. Both times it was used, my face broke out in a line of zit&#x27;s. Won&#x27;t stop buying Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products - but won&#x27;t ever buy this facial cleanser again.</li>
    <li> I  have uneven skin tone and have to be careful about cleansers.  This is the best one I have come across. Is it a miracle worker? No, but it does the best job for me and I&#x27;ve tried alot of them out there.  I&#x27;m frustrated about other reviewers upset that it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup. How about reviewing it for what  Burts Bees advertizes it as. It does a great job of cleaning my face without making it feel dry and minimizes the irritation. When I do wear makeup I remove it first with a makeup remover and then use this.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is a very good cleanser for my sensitive skin.  It doesn&#x27;t cause redness or strip my skin, but it is very soothing and cleans my skin very well after my oil cleansing to remove water resistant makeup and sunblock.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is nice and thick.  It smells good and is all natural, just what we expect from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t clear up my break outs either.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent new breakouts and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel clean after using it.</li>
    <li> I have oily, sensitive skin and I wear foundation every day.  Olay Foaming Face Wash for sensitive skin has worked well for me for the past few years, but I have been wanting to try something more natural.  I already use Burt&#x27;s Bees toner, and I was given a chance to try this Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser for free through BzzAgent.  This is not a foaming cleanser; it&#x27;s more of a creamy consistency.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free and has natural ingredients, but this just doesn&#x27;t remove all my makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much more than water alone.  It does seem very moisturizing, and could be a good choice for someone with dry skin or who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup, but it does not work for me.</li>
    <li> I am a 32 year old woman who has been very picky in findinga skin-care regimen for my entire life - for that reason, it has been hard to have any kind of consistent routine in taking care of my skin. I am especially fond of natural products, which has catered to my pickiness, given there had not been many of these products to choose from while growing up. I would have to say that finding this product absolutely came at the right time as my age is getting to a point where I probably shouldn&#x27;t disregard a skin-care routine any longer. After having tried the cleanser and moisturizer every morning for the past week, I think i have found a product I can stick with for the long-term. It caters to my needs, without too many harsh ingredients affecting seemingly virgin skin. If you are reading this and find what I have said resounding with you, then this product is for you!</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this product to review as a buzz agent. The best thing about the cleasner is that it is all natural. The second is that it removed my eye makeup (including eyeliner &amp; mascara) better than my expensive eyemakeup remover! So for myself, it its economical since I don&#x27;t have to buy another product. I like a creamy lotion type cleanser because they don&#x27;t dry out my skin and the Sensitive Facial Cleanser does the job perfectely. My face feels clean, not stripped.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes since it&#x27;s a natural product coz I have combination/sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t wear make...It felt too heavy/lotiony and my face didn&#x27;t feel clean...looked dull actually and not to mention the breakout I got. I switched to neutrogena naturals and couldn&#x27;t be happier! !</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive combination skin on the face (oily in some spots, dry in others), and my husband has normal oily skin. This product did wonders for both of us surprisingly. It was able to moisturize my dry spots and help reduce the oil on the oily parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that Burt&#x27;s Bees is made in America, and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this face wash, i love this brand.</li>
    <li> It leaves a bit of a filmy residue, and it doesn&#x27;t have much actual cleansing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I cannot tell how well it works for makeup removal. But on bare skin, it is lackluster at best. Perhaps use as a secondary cleanser after makeup / dirt removal, if your skin can take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed up with a water-based toner and chemical exfoliant, as I do in my normal routine. Before exfoliation, my skin still felt a bit grimy despite cleansing. After exfoliation, however, it felt about as normal. I just can&#x27;t stand the filmy feeling in between.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser has worked very well on my sensitive face for the past 18 months I&#x27;ve been using it.  I&#x27;ve had fewer breakouts and my face has not been as dry as it has been with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... after a couple months (these tubes last a while, which is good), the nozzle gets moldy.  Quite moldy, in fact.  I store my cleanser in the shower, so that contributes to the mold, no doubt.  If you store the product in a drier spot (or use it faster), perhaps it won&#x27;t get moldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mold or not, the product works.  Especially for the first 6-8 weeks.</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser ever.  Face feels so good afterward, and I love that it&#x27;s natural without any chemicals on my face and truly unscented.  Good price too.  Cheaper than brick and mortar stores.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for dry/sensitive skin. I struggle with breakouts and skin generally and this cream cleanser has been a welcome update to my skincare routine. I used to have terrible flakey skin, a mix of blackheads and spots and overactive sebaceous filaments. Approaching 30, my skin FINALLY looks like a normal person&#x27;s after ditching expensive/chemical products and using the following: Burt&#x27;s Sensitive Facial Cleanser (for make-up removal/general cleansing), Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel toner w/aloe (morning and night) and LT Organic&#x27;s virgin Argan Oil mixed with a few drops of pure lavender oil (morning and night).</li>
    <li> I break out very easily.  I have tried SO MANY cleansers including the more expensive kinds.  This is the only one that leaves my face smooth and happy.  I also like that there are no parabens in the product.  If you have sensitive and/or combination skin, give this a try.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash as it doesn&#x27;t make my face dry and face didn&#x27;t break out after 2 weeks of use.  Wish it came in a pump bottle, but can&#x27;t have everything.  Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> The product is in perfect conditions. Thanks to the provider, all is ok. I recommend and i save to my favorites.</li>
    <li> (I&#x27;m female writing on my husband&#x27;s account.) I have dry, very, very sensitive skin. I&#x27;m blessed to not suffer from much acne (besides the occasional &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; bump or two) but most facial cleansers are either too harsh, or actually nice to my skin but don&#x27;t seem to really clean them. I must say, I bought this thinking it might be too weak to take off the mascara I wear, but it removes it better than the St Ives Apricot Scrub I was using! I also no longer get out of the shower with red, irritated cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I think my real problem was that I didn&#x27;t want to give up that great &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; feeling that the other cleansers like St Ives have, with the actual exfoliating beads...but I finally came to terms with the fact that I NEED a gentler, creamier cleanser. And this is it! I definitely recommend it &#x3D;).</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and for years had been trying to find a cleanser that not only didn&#x27;t make me break break out, but didn&#x27;t break the bank. I first tried it as a BzzAgent in 2011 and have been hooked ever since. I like that this product is gentle enough for me to use every day and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face after washing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to incorporate more natural products into my facial care, and I liked the reviews for this item.&lt;br /&gt;I think it does a good job of cleaning the skin w/o totally stripping its natural oils.  I don&#x27;t have severe facial tightening as I have experienced with many other cleansers.  My skin does feel clean &amp; moisturized.  I used this product to clean off makeup at first, but I felt I used too much for that purpose.  I now use a soap (Basis&#x27;s Vitamin Bar) to first wipe off the makeup &amp; then this to cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne-prone skin, and I don&#x27;t find these ingredients to exasperate this problem.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this for now!</li>
    <li> I love Burts Bees and this online deal was way cheaper than the prices at stores so I am glad that I found this deal.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural face wash without a bunch of nasty chemicals I can find that is also non pore-clogging. I have acne, and very delicate skin from all the stupid medications I&#x27;m on and this face wash works very well and is very gentle. It feels very nice when you use it, and I never feel a residue when I&#x27;m done with it, I also don&#x27;t feel all dry and taught which can happen with a lot of other products. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Having sensitive and winter-dry skin, I try to check out some other products when I get tired of the ones I am using and as I am getting older, I might need something to iron out some skin issues i.e. skintone.  However, I have started and stopped this product twice since using as each time, I saw breakouts.  Not sure what is in the products that does this, but for me, it&#x27;s a no-no. I did liked the texture and I did not find a smell.  So like many people, I have gone back to my regiment of Free and Clear Gel Cleanser in morning (even Cetaphyl is not for me) and at night I have been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Natural Cleanser, which is helping me alot. A bit drying in certain spots as it is still winter, but that is better than spots! I also suffer from a mild form of eczema when the allergy seasons starts.  As I have read alot, the simpler the better. I do also try a toner now and then (simple ones) but rarely.  I have just started a mask that I will try too - from Freeman - so we shall see how I go.</li>
    <li> I feel like i am washing my face with lotion. it doesn&#x27;t feel like a face wash. perhaps my skin isn&#x27;t dry enough, but it is alright... i really don&#x27;t need moisturizer after washing my face with this.</li>
    <li> This Burt&#x27;s Bee Sensitive Skin Cleanser is great you only need a little, but you feel the softness right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive, dry flaky skin and this works for me.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  I HAD A LIVE CHAT WITH CONNIE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SHE FIXED THE PROBLEM RIGHT AWAT.  I COULDN&#x27;T ASK FOR BETTER OR NICER SERVICE.    THIS IS UNUSABLE.  When I received it, it did not have the foil seal over the inner opening, and it smelled sour.  I&#x27;m afraid to use it, and I really want this product.  It looks like someone already opened it and smeared it around.  Now what do I do?</li>
    <li> Love it! I wash my face with this and apply the clary sage daytime moisturizer with it. My skin looks very nice!</li>
    <li> Love this face wash - leaves my face feeling clean, and even though it is super creamy, it does not feel oily at all.</li>
    <li> I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  I have sensitive skin issues and this doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.  It is the only thing I wash my face with.</li>
    <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive facial cleanser is an excellent product that delivers.  ABOUT: According to the packaging, this product is in the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; skincare line and offers a \\&quot;natural skin solution\\&quot; that \\&quot;moisturizes without causing redness or irritation\\&quot;. It is also \\&quot;soap-free, fragrance-free, and hypo-allergenic\\&quot;. The bottle boasts the ability to \\&quot;soften, moisturize, and soothe\\&quot;.  REVIEW: I decided to review this product because I am disappointed in the current reviews.  Too many times have people mentioned that they would rate this higher if it offered anti-acne medication and/or some type of aging-deterrent. People! Why not review the product for how it performs with the actual claims on the bottle? Specifically - soften, moisturize, and soothe.    I have been using this product for three weeks now. I have acne-prone skin that is very sensitive because of several topical medications that I am on which address this acne-prone skin. For me, the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of facial cleansers is a product that is gentle enough to not irritate my skin, but still effective as a cleansing agent. Does not cause break-outs. Oh, yeah - and please add a moisturizing component and an aesthetic experience. With these requirements, let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been around the block a few times with cleansers - from department stores (Clinique) to drug stores (everything!).    This cleanser is the best that I have used! I love the creamy consistency, which gently removes makeup, dirt, grime, and grease while still leaving my skin feeling moisturized. It does not form a gross suds-ball because it isn&#x27;t full of unnecessary and irritating surfactants/detergents. It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, and while unscented, it has a very faint \\&quot;toasted rice\\&quot; scent to it, which may be the Rice extract. I noticed that a few reviewers commented on the \\&quot;film\\&quot; that it left on their face - honey, those are your natural oils! I agree that I also felt a little \\&quot;filmy\\&quot; after I first used it, but by the next wash that sensation went away - replaced by a thrill of not having to rush for my moisturizer within 30 seconds to replace all the oils I just stripped away. It&#x27;s quite nice!    In summary, this facial cleanser delivers. If you are looking for an anti-aging or anti-acne cleanser, this is NOT it. If you are looking for a cleanser that will clean and moisturize your sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t know that you will find a better product than this one. By the way, it&#x27;s 99.0% natural - that&#x27;s pretty great, too!</li>
    <li> Does not foam up but does remove facial makeup (don&#x27;t use on eyes) thoroughly.  Does not irritate or dry out mature (late 40&#x27;s skin).  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees &#x27; Date of production is the Third -fourth Digital.For an example:Product batch number is6581123,11Expressed as2011.but my purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees &#x27; Product batch number is 997605,I was confused,This means Production of 2060year .My God who could tell What does that mean.

    <li> Suits my extremely dry skin type. It doesnt dry out my skin. I have very dry peeling skin. This is calming and has reduced redness. Burts Bees has done it again. totally recommended for people with very dry skin</li>
    <li> Smells like it is rancid. Not sure if it is supposed to smell this way or if they sent an old tube.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has dry skin and she loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;No added chemicals is the reason I love Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having issues with dry skin and redness on my face after using other soaps and washes, so I thought I would try this. This works. It totally performs as advertised. It has the texture and characteristics of lotion. Just my opinion, but i find it a little difficult to rinse off. The rice/cotton extract version smells kinda funny to me, but neither really take away from the overall experience. I&#x27;ll be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AS OF 12/5/13&lt;br /&gt;Had to quit using because it was drying my face out to the point of pain. it probably won&#x27;t do this to everyone but if you have even mild eczema don&#x27;t use this.</li>
    <li> I bought this product recently and at first I was very skeptical. I had read other reviews online (on another website I think) and they were about 50/50. Either you loved it or hated it. Since using this (glad I got it) I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with what I&#x27;m seeing that I felt so compelled to come back online and write my own review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pregnant right now and there&#x27;s a lot of facial cleansers I can&#x27;t use anymore, including the products I had before I was pregnant. But since I bought Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Sensitive facial cleanser with cotton extract, my skin has never looked so good! I swear it&#x27;s actually improving! I&#x27;m the kind of person who can&#x27;t feel comfortable or confident stepping outside without a ton of makeup to cover up my acne, my uneven skin tone, and all the redness and irritation. But now it&#x27;s like I have a new face, lol! I might even go out sans makeup for the first time in... well, forever. The redness and irritation I&#x27;ve always had is gone. My oily-ness is under control. My acne has definitely subsided so much that my skin looks clear. Even my skin tone somehow looks uniform and glowing. This stuff is awesome! When it comes to facial cleansers, I&#x27;ve just about used it all. Some stuff works just okay, other stuff is really harsh and damaging to my skin. But this doesn&#x27;t further irritate my skin, it doesn&#x27;t make it even redder after using it, it doesn&#x27;t burn, it doesn&#x27;t itch, it doesn&#x27;t dry me out or make my skin even oily-er, and it actually visibly works. It&#x27;s not like some fairy tale I&#x27;m believing in, telling myself that it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s actually working and I can visibly see the results! I&#x27;ve never had skin like this before. It looks healthy! Even the small blackheads on my chin have gone away and the pores are diminishing (something no other product has been able to do before). The first time I used this I had been getting a small pimple on the worst spot of my face- on the tip of my nose. After I used it that first night, by the morningthe pimple was completely gone already with no irritation left behind. I&#x27;m amazed at how healthy my skin is now. Lol, have I said that enough? I also love that my skin feels moisturized and soft throughout the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware of how much you squeeze out because it does tend to come out fast. The cleanser is very much like a cream. It doesn&#x27;t lather up like others do, but that&#x27;s okay if it works. It has a very clean, subtle smell (kind of like cotton). Some people may not like the smell because it&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re used to, but it&#x27;s not stinky or overpowering. On the reviews I saw before I bought this, a lot of women were complaining that it wasn&#x27;t able to wash off their makeup. I don&#x27;t know what type of makeup they&#x27;re using, but it&#x27;s been up to the task for me and does remove it. But now I may not even need to wear makeup anymore (that would be awesome!). The cleanser is very thick. I splash water on my face before I apply to help with that. I gently rub it into my face in small circles and leave it on for maybe a minute without touching it, before applying more water and gently rubbing it further in. Because it is very thick it takes the help of a cloth to rinse it off. I don&#x27;t scrub at my face more when I do this. I kind of splash water onto my face with it and gently dab and wipe away. Works just fine to rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, I am very pleased with this product! My skin looks healthy and for me that&#x27;s a big deal. :)</li>
    <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars trying every facial wash out there, not thinking about BB&#x27;s products, well, all I can say is, they guarntee their products, first time I used it, my face felt very soft, not like some facial washes, where you feel like a prune...help I need my moisturer.  This is awesome, I will be a return buyer, having sensitive skin can be very fustracting, but BB&#x27;s products have won me...great  product..:):):)</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin; I suffer from psoriasis on my scalp and elbows, and have always had issues with finding facial cleansers that don&#x27;t aggravate my skin.  So far, this product fits the bill!  It&#x27;s a very non-abrasive cleanser, with a very thick consistency; a small amount goes a long way.  So far, it has left my skin calm and reduces quite a bit of the redness.</li>
    <li> Love how it cleans without drying out your face! Bonus all natural products!</li>
    <li> I have over four months using this product and my skin looks and feels amazing. I think it balances your skin naturally. G</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and face wash I&#x27;ve used in the past has given me very dry skin and left my face red and blotchy.  Ever since I started using this particular Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Face Wash I have had ZERO problems!!  So, I keep using it and keep my fingers crossed, but after about two years my face is still happy every day.  I am a very happy, repeat customer! (and when you have Amazon Prime, why not order the stuff online?!  I&#x27;ve seen plenty of pharmacies and drug stores that didn&#x27;t stock this particular cleanser).</li>
    <li> It is a great cleanser for the sensitive skin. Love all the Burt&#x27;s Bee products and this was no exception.</li>
    <li> Sure cleans and moisturizes</li>
    <li> I have breakout prone skin but this face wash has been great. Especially in the winter. It leaves my face feeling moisturized and helps to avoid a peeling nose.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive yet breakout prone skin. I have also acne scars on my cheeks because I suffered from severe cystic acne due to hormonal imbalance (now cleared). It was very hard for me to find a mild cleanser that does not burn my skin. So far this year I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil, Philosophy(Purity), Fresh(Soy) and Boscia. Although these are all mild and worth trying, I def pick Burt&#x27;s Bees above all because it is just amazing! IT will leave your skin soft and hydrated. Price also good. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I think this may not be a good option for oily skin.</li>
    <li> Great for my sensitive skin. I have been using it for years. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My face isn&#x27;t tried out and it feel clean and moisturized after, even before I put on lotion.  I&#x27;ll be a user of this cleanser for life.</li>
    <li> I first cleanse with a more aggressive cleanser since I&#x27;m out in the polluted elements so much.  Then finish w/ this product which leaves skin cottony soft :)</li>
    <li> I really like this facial cleanser since I have very low maintenece skin, but if I do get a breakout, I revert back my good ol&#x27; Witch Hazel. This kind of feels like your applying a cool cream, but has more of a lotion feel and not the typical cool, clean and refreshing feeling when you rinse it off. My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like it do to the mediocore clean feeling, but for me, the chemical free ingredients make it 5 stars in my book!!</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this to me. Then I ordered five. I tried this. Really good!  Keep my face wet all the time.</li>
    <li> Seemed to clean ok.  Doesn&#x27;t suds up, which wasn&#x27;t a surprise from description and reviews.  Felt like it left a film on my face.</li>
    <li> This is a nice creamy cleanser which gets my face really clean without drying or irritation.  Even though it is creamy, it rinses off very well, no residue seems to be left behind. I definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a gentle cleanser.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Gently removes make up and smells delicious too.  It is a little aromatherapy snuck into your routine.  I enjoy it!  Leaves skin clean but not dry.</li>
    <li> best face product ive used! really saves my skin year round. i have had cystic acne for 6 years and combo skin. i have eczema as well and this face wash really really helps all that. ive used it for 3 years now and it helped clear my acne (i only have scarring now), it helps balance out the how dry and oily my skin is, and has never given me problems. a bottle lasts me around 3 months and i wash my face twice a day. i think its worth trying it out if you have sensitive acne prone skin, i never even tried their acne line since i figured itd be too harsh for me. just tried this and been using it for years and dont think ill stop!</li>
    <li> Most of the other cleansers I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ve noticed, have left my face feeling a little bit too clean... like a dry, tight, squeaky clean. Which is great, it cleaned my face. But, the bigger problem there is that those same cleansers were stripping my face of its essential oils. This caused a lot of problems and I wasn&#x27;t very happy.&lt;br /&gt;But then I found this. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling like it&#x27;s squeaky clean. It leaves it feeling light, refreshed, soft, and moisturized. It&#x27;s the best. I follow this with Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Toner. Works really well for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that is also oily so I need to wash my face before bed. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it works very well. You simply apply some of the cream all over your face, avoiding the eye area. Then you simply wipe it off with a warm washcloth. I follow with a toner and anti aging cream. So far I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is clearer. I&#x27;ll continue buying this as it soothes the skin and gives a good deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Absolutely non-irritating to skin, but only a mild inconvenience to makeup. I didn&#x27;t expect it to get the super-long-last mascara, but it leaves behind lots of foundation, blush etc. If you don&#x27;t wear makeup you might like it.</li>
    <li> This product works really well for me. It&#x27;s not too harsh on my skin, so it doesn&#x27;t dry it all up. It clears away all the oil/dirt on my skin at the end of the day, and in the morning it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate my face raw (like so many other face wash products!). It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re skin is sensitive. I use a powder foundation and so many other face wash products dry up my skin so much that I am unable to use makeup. It also has a subtle but nice fresh, clean scent due to the ingredients used. I also love knowing that the product is eco-friendly and also not animal tested. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> A month ago I changed birth control and it caused me to have a hormonal acne outbreak. My forehead was covered with tiny red bumps, the area around my nose was red and inflamed and my skin became very oily! I was at target looking at this and was pleased that it only had four ingredients. So many products for acne have many unnecessary ingredients that make acne worse like alcohol and perfume scents. After reading the reviews for this on here and on the target website, I gave it a try, plus it was on sale! When I would take a shower I would put it on after getting my face wet and keep it on while I did everything else, like a mask. The product is really thick, like lotion, and has a very faint scent which I love. Every morning when I woke up I&#x27;d touch my forehead to see how bumpy it was and it got more smooth every day. I believe I&#x27;ve used it every night the last 9 nights and I&#x27;m absolutely pleased with this! Just wow! My skin is so moisturized, too. I haven&#x27;t had to put lotion on my face when I wake up in the morning since my acne started to clear up because of it. I also tend to furrow and arch my eye brows when I&#x27;m thinking and over the years has caused a line/wrinkle on the side of my forehead and it&#x27;s like..gone. I can barely see it. So the moisturizing ingredient in this product has given better treatment than expected!</li>
    <li> I have tried the black tea mash from fresh I loved it so much but the price is too much, this one&#x27;s feeling texture and smell almost same as it, but price only 1/10</li>
    <li> good deal . will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser because i liked that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals, fragrance etc. I had a BB cream on, washed my face and felt really good and clean, until i wiped my face with a cotton ball and toner. By looking at the cotton ball, i could say that it didn&#x27;t clean the BB cream or any dirt off of my face. I used it the next day, this time i didn&#x27;t have BB cream on. Again, the cotton ball had a dark color with all the dirt that was not washed off from my face. I don&#x27;t think it does a good job as a cleanser. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Great for my sensitive skin. Didn&#x27;t cause burning or irritation.</li>
    <li> found that was opened after receive</li>
    <li> A fine product. I give it high marks.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to my Olay face wash, which didn&#x27;t do me any favors. I have combination skin and this product is working out really well. My fiance noticed right away how soft my face was. That&#x27;s a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will revise as needed.</li>
    <li> Cleanser arrived quickly and I had used it before so knew it was good. The only thing was at the store it usually has a foil under the cap you have to remove. This one didn&#x27;t but I don&#x27;t think it was used.</li>
    <li> Best cash wash for super sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I like that it is fragrance free. Cleanses well without overdrying. I&#x27;m also prone to breakouts, but my skin has cleared up nicely since switching to this product.</li>
    <li> Love it. I usually use the deep cleanser which is a little thicker than this one but this work great too. I love the way it makes my face feel. Not as soft as a baby behind but with a fresh feeling of brand new. No redness or sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> A little background: My skin is oily, milk chocolate colored, and not sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a week and have no complaints thus far. This stuff has a creamy texture and does not lather, so it feels like washing my face with lotion. Not a thick Eucerin-type lotion, but more like a Curel/Jergins-type one. So be sure to rinse it off entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is also a darn good makeup remover---and I&#x27;m talking removes coal-black eyeliner and mascara, red lipstick, and medium-darkish makeup no problem good. It does that all without &amp;#34;grinding&amp;#34; my skin, leaving it dry or oily, or irritating it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff removes oil from my skin without making it dry, so it&#x27;s good for oily skin. And because it does not &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; oil, and in fact has moisturiser in it (the rice extract, I believe), it should be good for dry skin, too. But I can&#x27;t say. I don&#x27;t feel like I &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; to wear moisturiser anymore, but I can&#x27;t speak from the point-of-view of someone who has extremely dry skin. Oh, and well, it&#x27;s no longer winter, so that surely factors into it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s see... I use the cotton/rise extract one and it doesn&#x27;t have a scent beyond a default lotiony scent, so it&#x27;s definitely not something that will run you out of the bathroom. That&#x27;s all I can think of right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this for anyone who desires what it is advertised to be: a nonfancy gentle cleanser that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> When I finally stopped using harsh products on my skin and switched to this mt adult acne cleared up. Once in a while.I have some black heads or a pimple but its rare and my awful.cystic acne is GONE. Ive been using it for over a year and I highly recommend it, as far as people who said it wouldnt take their makeup off... Id use a makeup remover or some olive oil or coconut oil to remove their makeup and then wash with this. I dont wear makeup regularly but when I do thats what I do.  Ive used a lot of different face washes on the market and none of them really take makeup off, and if it does its probably way harsh for your skin. Just my two cents. I love this product personally, and its the only thing that has worked for my combination skin.</li>
    <li> Good and supposedly good for you - without those dangerous additives.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans, washes off easily.  No unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> I usually use the burt&#x27;s bees peach pit and willowbark facial scrub and I decided to try something new. This facial cleanser is just too watery for my liking. It feels very oily and the smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Purchased this locally to give it a try. Now will not use anything else always have 1 in reserve in case I run out</li>
    <li> Super gentle, but still gets my skin super clean. I&#x27;ve almost exclusively used cleansers made for fighting acne, but I decided to switch to a more basic cleanser, and it is the best thing I&#x27;ve done for my skin. If you&#x27;re using other cleansers and they haven&#x27;t worked for your skin (or have been overdrying or irritating), I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This face wash is hypoallergenic, which is a plus, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it really did anything for my skin, besides clean it. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and I am a devoted customer, but this product wasn&#x27;t a favorite of mine.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my sensitive skin, lasts awhile too.</li>
    <li> I used to buy Burt&#x27;s Bees, thinking I was doing something good for both my skin and the environment.  I took it for granted that this was a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product. However, this, and other Burt&#x27;s Bees (now owned by Clorox) products, actually have some ingredients that aren&#x27;t so great for your skin.    Further, the palm oil in here is very bad for the orangutan population.  Glyceryl oleate is just another word for palm oil ([...]), which is destroying rain forests.  The company has scored worse than any other major company when it comes to their response to this issue.      Why buy from a company so careless and callus about this issue?  We vote with our wallets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician, so I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of products for my oily/combination, super sensitive skin.  I prefer more natural products, but even those often contain ingredients that are irritating.  I picked up this cleanser when I ran out of another cleanser while on vacation in a small town with few places to shop.  I found it to remove makeup very well and still be very gentle.  It leaves my face feeling clean and comfortable.  My husband has started using it, too.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I stuck with a cleanser for this long.</li>
    <li> I first used this cleanser when my 26 year old daughter brought it home with her when she came for a visit.  I love it mostly because it is fragrance free (I get migraines), and does a great job of cleaning my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too thick/lotion-y for a facial wash.  It smells OK.  I like Burt&#x27;s Bees company, but I am going to do research and try to find another facial cleanser that is not as thick and smells better.  Right now I love Trader Joe&#x27;s brand of facial washes.</li>
