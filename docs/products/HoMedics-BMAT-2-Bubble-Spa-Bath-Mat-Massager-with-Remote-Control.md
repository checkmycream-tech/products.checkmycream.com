### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was so happy to get our bubble spa!</li>
      <li>For people who cannot afford a jacuzzi, this is perfect for relaxation.  </li>
      <li>I was very impressed with the price and the two year warranty and couldn&#x27;t wait for its arrival.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve been very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
      <li>in all, I think this unit is very good for the price.  </li>
      <li>She loved it!</li>
      <li>This was a great gift.</li>
      <li>The relaxing bath becomes a great source of tension.</li>
      <li>A great idea.</li>
      <li>Said it was as good as what she used at Bally&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>It was a good idea</li>
      <li>My husband and I love the deluxe bubble spa!  </li>
      <li>My neck and shoulders really liked that.  </li>
      <li>What kind of warrenty does it have.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually very effective and pleasant to use - compares quite favourably to a real spa bath, considering the price.  </li>
      <li>Wow, awesome!</li>
      <li>HoMedics have great ideas, but they rarely put it in their design.  </li>
      <li>The unit is quite powerful - my wife is quite happy using it on the medium setting.</li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m glad I got it</li>
      <li>I love taking baths now:)</li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m glad I got it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible for the money..</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It appears that the folks at Homedics have been reading these reviews because many (if not all) of the concerns raised by the reviewers have been addressed.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>My wife gets in the tub on top of the mat and then turns on the blower.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I love spas</li>
      <li>It &#x27;s much better than the wimpy jet spa that sticks on the side of the tub.  </li>
      <li>We are extremely pleased.</li>
      <li>, I just wish they could make it work better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Interestingly, I purchased this unit from a shopping on tv option where they had MANY of these units running.  </li>
      <li>It loosens my muscles up pretty good.  </li>
      <li>However the 3 large pieces with huge suction cups stick very nicely.</li>
      <li>I was excited to receive a BubbleSpa Massaging Bubble Mat, and looked forward to many relaxing baths.</li>
      <li>Given that you&#x27;d easily pay twenty times as much to upgrade your bath to a real spa bath; I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very good compromise.</li>
      <li>Because, the outer suctions on the straps came off so easily, however, I did rate it a four out of five.</li>
      <li>Setting up this unit was easy as well and taking it apart for storage.  </li>
      <li>Because of the way it works the bath water cooled very quickly</li>
      <li>Just follow the instructions and make sure your bath is clean and it all works just fine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has no problem making bubbles and the three speeds are fine.</li>
      <li>All this means is during a half-hour session in the bath, you might need to top up the bathwater with more hot water a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;Clean up</li>
      <li>The three speeds are fine and the unit generates lots of bubbles.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is a huge chore as well and cancels out any relaxing advantages this product might (but doesn&#x27;t) offer.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>wife does want another one, but I&#x27;ll probably see what else is available , given the problems I&#x27;ve had to deal with on this one.</li>
      <li>With the bubbles all around her ears, she said the sound wasn&#x27;t bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>is really easy too - just drain the bath after you&#x27;re done, put in some clean water, and run the unit for a while.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy using this a day after I work out at the gym.  </li>
      <li>As for the heat option, no, it isn&#x27;t really that warm, but if they made the air any hotter, it would melt the hose.  </li>
      <li>When you are trying to relax, that is not the sound you want to hear.  </li>
      <li>How they managed to muffle all that sound was beyond me.  </li>
      <li>The clean up of the unit does take away from it&#x27;s ability to relax, as stated by another reviewers.</li>
      <li>IT does though feel good and gets hot, BUT it is really LOUD!</li>
      <li>You eventually end up play with a mat that wants to float to the top of the water, but you wanted to lay on the it.  </li>
      <li>The noise of this is not bad.</li>
      <li>It also is really easy to use, and a great alternative to a regular old bubble bath.  </li>
      <li>However, that is hardly surprising and you can&#x27;t really blame the unit for not being able to get hot enough to compensate for all that heat loss.  </li>
      <li>Cleaning (really just blowing out any water in the mat) is quick and easy.</li>
      <li>Very convenient!!--        </li>
      <li>It is comfortable to sit on and the bubbles are really relaxing.</li>
      <li>If the mat would stick to the tub bottom, hose stay connected, suction cup for remote remain attached to tub side, motor operate quietly, and an explanation for the use of the programmed mode was included it would be an excellent product.</li>
      <li>As a bonus, the unit is 50% smaller then the Deluxe (or</li>
      <li>I did not think it was worth the money.  </li>
      <li>If it is, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>assembling and starting up the unit, I was pleased to see the thousands of bubbles that filled my tub.</li>
      <li>It is a good thing this model has a remote and</li>
      <li>I was impressed with the power that this model had, and I was glad that I ordered the model with the remote, as the unit has to sit far away from my tub, due to my electrical outlets.  </li>
      <li>and I like it very much.</li>
      <li>The hose is now reinforced and doesn&#x27;t collapse when hot.</li>
      <li>bubble strength is stronger and more massaging than any Jacuzzi jets I&#x27;ve ever felt; I recently took a weekend road trip and booked a room with a Jacuzzi tub</li>
      <li>whoever said it was a floating air mattress was absolutely correct!</li>
      <li>Also the unit creates a lot of noise and while in the program mode the sound varies from loud, louder, and loudest.</li>
      <li>Frankly, my bubblespa is the most relaxing thing that I do for myself on a regular basis--</li>
      <li>This mat makes his back and legs feel much better.  </li>
      <li>I have wanted one of these since I first sat in a jacuzzi when I was about 15.  </li>
      <li>Because the mat is pumping room air into the bath water, it does tend to cool off, but I start out with pretty hot water to begin with and it doesn&#x27;t cool down too much unless I stay in the tub with it running for more than 20 minutes or so--        </li>
      <li>I felt kind of silly buying my wife a bubble mat for her birthday, but she really liked it.</li>
      <li>Our heat option felt pretty cool, maybe I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to warm up.</li>
      <li>Our heat option felt pretty cool, maybe I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to warm up.</li>

      <li>The motor is pretty loud, especially on high or during the program - my husband stated we should have just reversed our vaccum.</li>
      <li>This, in my opinion, was actually better because it was easier to adjust the mat to spots on my body which felt more tense.  </li>
      <li>I liked it because it costs about $1500 less than the jacuzzi tub</li>
      <li>mat is quite comfortable to sit on too; you don&#x27;t really notice it once everything&#x27;s up and running.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly the unit is noisy - it is, after all, just like taking a bath with a vacuum-cleaner switched on next to you!  </li>
      <li>Much to my disapointment the suction cups DO NOT STICK to my tub.</li>
      <li>And it is very noisy.</li>
      <li>The problem is that since it doesn&#x27;t stick to the bottom very well it tends to float.</li>
      <li>I never did figure out how the program option works since the directions don&#x27;t really explain it.</li>
      <li>My wife (the one in the tub) didn&#x27;t really have a problem with the noise.</li>
      <li>she really wanted for her birthday.</li>
      <li>It did however provide tons of bubbles and you really feel like your in a jacuzzi tub, but if I could return it I would.</li>
      <li>Most bathrooms are tile floored, and not very acustic on the walls.  </li>
      <li>Very good!&lt;br</li>
      <li>My suggestion: Don&#x27;t use duct tape and Start saving for a real tub</li>
      <li>The cleaning process was a piece of cake - I don&#x27;t really understand all the complaints.</li>
      <li>The cleaning process was a piece of cake - I don&#x27;t really understand all the complaints.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not that much cleanup.  </li>
      <li>Then the other end came out of the fitting going into the blower.</li>
      <li>I,too was excited to receive what I refer to as my White Trash Jacuzzi.</li>
      <li>After this, I tried each of the massage programs for fifteen minutes each and found each one to be excellent, but my favorite was the 3rd program with approximately 15 minutes of high pressure followed by a lack of pressure for about 1 second, switching back and forth between the high pressure and the no pressure.  </li>
      <li>It is pretty loud, both the motor and the bubbles.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Unfortunately, we do not sell direct, so any type of refund must come from the place of purchase.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;If</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was so happy to get our bubble spa! It was not out of the box 15 minutes, before we had to give it a try. As with the other reviews, it does not stick to your tub. Thought it was maybe my type of tub, but I see not. The clean up of the unit does take away from it&#x27;s ability to relax, as stated by another reviewers. A great idea. But has a very long way to go. I will not return it...... but would not recommend it with it&#x27;s present design.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews I was alittle wary on buying the product, but after months I bought it anyways. I had no problems with the suctions cups sticking (I got the tub wet first and step all over the mat to ensure suction before starting the bath). Although I agree they should have provided bigger suction cups. The motor is pretty loud, especially on high or during the program - my husband stated we should have just reversed our vaccum. However being such a large motor, it did produce alot of bubbles.  Our heat option felt pretty cool, maybe I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to warm up. The cleaning process was a piece of cake - I don&#x27;t really understand all the complaints. All in all, I&#x27;m glad I got it -- it makes a decent jacuzzi bath for those who don&#x27;t have one.</li>
    <li> My wife bugged me until I finally got her this product. She loved it! Said it was as good as what she used at Bally&#x27;s. However, we did find that the suction cups wouldn&#x27;t stick to our non-slip tub finish. Nothing I tried would make it stick. My wife gets in the tub on top of the mat and then turns on the blower. The hose did cause problems by coming out, but by putting a tye wrap arond the plastic socket for the hose, it stays in. Then the other end came out of the fitting going into the blower. Oh well, I fixed that too.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it just quit working. I think there was water in the hose from being left in  the tub after it came out of the mat once, and water drained back into the blower unit. &lt;br /&gt;The unit just won&#x27;t turn on. I let it dry out one evening and it worked the next night for a little while, but finally quit completely. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Next question if HoMedics looks at these reports. What kind of warrenty does it have. My wife got it for Christmas and we haven&#x27;t had it a year yet.&lt;br /&gt;My wife does want another one, but I&#x27;ll probably see what else is available , given the problems I&#x27;ve had to deal with on this one.</li>
    <li> I recieved this item and was disappointed right out of the box being that there was NO REMOTE CONTROL like the TITLE SAYS. Its a challenge to get the suction cups to stay stuck to the bottom of the tub. Its kinda noisy even on the low setting. It&#x27;s not terrible for the money.. It works- I&#x27;ll give&#x27;em that but I wish I had recieved the one they displayed in the title.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Elite (BMAT-5) version of this spa (. . .) &lt;br /&gt;It appears that the folks at Homedics have been reading these reviews because many (if not all) of the concerns raised by the reviewers have been addressed. The hose is now reinforced and doesn&#x27;t collapse when hot. The suction cups are well designed - there was no way this mat was coming off my tub floor. The unit is quite powerful - my wife is quite happy using it on the medium setting. Cleaning (really just blowing out any water in the mat) is quick and easy. As a bonus, the unit is 50% smaller then the Deluxe (or at least that&#x27;s what the box says).&lt;br /&gt;One thing the mat isn&#x27;t, however, is quiet. The unit sounds like a turbo-powered hair dryer and the bubbles make a lot of noise as well. You shouldn&#x27;t buy this product with visions of a quiet bubble bath listening to Enya. (You&#x27;re not supposed to use soaps or oils, anyway, because they get into the mat and cause bad things to happen). To minimize the noise, I tried putting the unit behind the bathroom door, but the remote didn&#x27;t seem to work through the wall. I finally just threw a towel over the unit and this helped quite a bit. The air intake is under the motor so I think I can do this without causing it to overheat and blow up. My wife (the one in the tub) didn&#x27;t really have a problem with the noise. With the bubbles all around her ears, she said the sound wasn&#x27;t bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this Homedics products does what it promises and does it well. I felt kind of silly buying my wife a bubble mat for her birthday, but she really liked it. I liked it because it costs about $1500 less than the jacuzzi tub she really wanted for her birthday. Who knows, when nobody&#x27;s looking I might try it myself.</li>
    <li> HoMedics have great ideas, but they rarely put it in their design.  I live in a new house, and all of my tubs have a anti-slip finish (made not smooth on purpose).  This tub design is fairly common.  HoMedics should of taken into consideration when designing the suction cups.  The cups would NOT stick to the tub.  You eventually end up play with a mat that wants to float to the top of the water, but you wanted to lay on the it.  Just like another user said, the floating part end up spraying water mist at ya.  It will not relax you, but drive you crazy.  SKIP THIS PRODUCT ALL TOGETHER!!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive a BubbleSpa Massaging Bubble Mat, and looked forward to many relaxing baths. &lt;br /&gt;Upon assembling and starting up the unit, I was pleased to see the thousands of bubbles that filled my tub. Although the unit was *extremely* loud, I overlooked this in anticipation of a relaxing spa experience.&lt;br /&gt;Upon entering the bathtub (which I had filled with hot water minutes earlier), I was shocked to find that the water had already turned cold. Upon further investigation, I realized that the air being pumped through the Homedics unit and out to the spa mat was producing ice cold bubbles, which quickly turned my relaxing hot bath into an arctic nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of cold baths, and could find no use for this product. &lt;br /&gt;I contacted Homedics to give them my feedback and got this generic reply: \\&quot;Unfortunately, we do not sell direct, so any type of refund must come from the place of purchase.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;If you like cold baths and loud noise, this unit is for you. Otherwise, you may want to consider another product if your purpose is to relax in the tub.</li>
    <li> Unlike the people who have reviewed this product, I didn&#x27;t find the suction cups so annoying.  Some of them didn&#x27;t stick well, but 95% did, and it didn&#x27;t bother me.  I was impressed with the power that this model had, and I was glad that I ordered the model with the remote, as the unit has to sit far away from my tub, due to my electrical outlets.  For people who cannot afford a jacuzzi, this is perfect for relaxation.  As for the heat option, no, it isn&#x27;t really that warm, but if they made the air any hotter, it would melt the hose.  At least it&#x27;s better than totally cold air.  As for cleanup, I don&#x27;t follow the instructions.  I just keep the blower on for an extra ten minutes after the water drains, and disconnect everything.  it&#x27;s not that much cleanup.  If it is, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be a bit gimmicky, frankly.  But I&#x27;ve been very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, so I can&#x27;t comment on its longevity.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does everything it claims it can.  Unlike other reviews I&#x27;ve read here, I had no trouble with getting the mat to stay stuck to the floor of the tub, nor have I had any trouble with the hose disconnecting itself from the mat when in use.  Just follow the instructions and make sure your bath is clean and it all works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Bubble-wise, I was expecting it to be lacking in power, but this unit is well powered.  On the highest setting, it is almost too powerful for a standard sized tub - there is lots of agitation in the water.  Very good!&lt;br /&gt;The mat is quite comfortable to sit on too; you don&#x27;t really notice it once everything&#x27;s up and running.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly the unit is noisy - it is, after all, just like taking a bath with a vacuum-cleaner switched on next to you!  But this to be expected.  However, thanks to the long hose and the remote control that works through walls, you can hide the noisy control unit somewhere - like in the shower, or in a cupboard under the sink, or even put it outside the room and close the door.  That cuts down on the noise considerably.  And of course, the vigourous splashing of the bubbles tends to drown out the machine noise anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I agree the heat option doesn&#x27;t seem to do an awful lot.  While the hose warms up considerably and there must therefore be some heat coming through the mat; it&#x27;s not enough to combat the cooling effect of blowing all that air through the bathwater continuously.  However, that is hardly surprising and you can&#x27;t really blame the unit for not being able to get hot enough to compensate for all that heat loss.  All this means is during a half-hour session in the bath, you might need to top up the bathwater with more hot water a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is really easy too - just drain the bath after you&#x27;re done, put in some clean water, and run the unit for a while.  Then hang the mat up somewhere (like use its suction cups to stick it to the shower wall) to dry.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this unit is very good for the price.  It&#x27;s actually very effective and pleasant to use - compares quite favourably to a real spa bath, considering the price.  Given that you&#x27;d easily pay twenty times as much to upgrade your bath to a real spa bath; I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very good compromise.</li>
    <li> I have wanted one of these since I first sat in a jacuzzi when I was about 15.  I would always ask for one for Christmas but my parents would never get me one.  Flash forward to age 36, when after suffering through a horrible bought with bronchitis and finding some extra money in my budget I ordered one.  I was very impressed with the price and the two year warranty and couldn&#x27;t wait for its arrival. Now that I had it, I decided to designate an hour of my Sunday morning to consumer research of this product.  I started out by going through each of the bubble rates low, medium and high and found the experience to be equal to that of a spa but without the cost or the crowd or the risk of unsanitary conditions.  I tried this for a half hour and found that my preference was the low setting because it meant less water flying up toward my book which I like to read in the tub and less water outside of the tub.  After this, I tried each of the massage programs for fifteen minutes each and found each one to be excellent, but my favorite was the 3rd program with approximately 15 minutes of high pressure followed by a lack of pressure for about 1 second, switching back and forth between the high pressure and the no pressure.  My neck and shoulders really liked that.  It is true that it does blow cold air a little bit but I didn&#x27;t find that to be a problem.  I did rate this product a four because it comes with suctions that go out to the sides to keep the mat in place but the suction cups are attached through holes and four came off when I pulled them off.  So I slip the straps out through the back (you will understand this better when you see the actual unit) and used the suction cups to position the mat in the tub, sat down on it and started the water flowing.  This, in my opinion, was actually better because it was easier to adjust the mat to spots on my body which felt more tense.  Because, the outer suctions on the straps came off so easily, however, I did rate it a four out of five.</li>
    <li> The three speeds are fine and the unit generates lots of bubbles. I never did figure out how the program option works since the directions don&#x27;t really explain it. Also the unit creates a lot of noise and while in the program mode the sound varies from loud, louder, and loudest. It is a good thing this model has a remote and you don&#x27;t have to hang from the tub to change settings. The problem is that the little suction cups do not stick to the tub bottom. The tension level in your body will rise since it does not stick to the bottom of the tub and begins to float up against your body. If you move your feet off the end of the mat the hose detaches from the mat and then shoots water all over. You are then grabbing desperately for the end of the hose. You have a suction cup to help keep the hose in place, but it does not stick to the tub wall! The relaxing bath becomes a great source of tension. If the mat would stick to the tub bottom, hose stay connected, suction cup for remote remain attached to tub side, motor operate quietly, and an explanation for the use of the programmed mode was included it would be an excellent product. Also the heat feature is nice because without it the water does cool down quickly, however after 5-10 minutes the hose does become soft and partially colapses next to the unit because it overheats. This product would work better if the bath mat was constructed of hard plastic with a luer-lock type device to attach the hose. I will be returning the unit and I do not recommend it to anyone. I wonder how this product made it out of Homedics testing area. I bet the owners of Homedics did not give their family members this thing for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to my new Bubblespa....what a disappointment!  I should have returned it but didn&#x27;t.  Just as everyone else, I can&#x27;t get the suction cups to stick to the bottom of the tub...whoever said it was a floating air mattress was absolutely correct!</li>
    <li> My husband and I love the deluxe bubble spa!  It &#x27;s much better than the wimpy jet spa that sticks on the side of the tub.  But  we also found it frustrating that the suction cups were too small and wouldn&#x27;t stick to our non-slip tub.   WE HAVE THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM!  If you love the bubbble spa idea, but hate that it won&#x27;t stick because you have a non-slip tub, TRY PUTTING TWO MAGNETIC SIGNS (the kind that stick to the sides of trucks) BACK  TO BACK on the tub floor and then sticking the suction cups to that.  It works! Also, roll and sit on a hand towel for extra comfort.</li>
    <li> The bubble spa is very very loud, the air coming through the tiny little holes is very cold and the hose will not stay  in the darn thing. About the suction cups, the big ones worked for me but the smaller ones WILL NOT WORK. IT does though feel good and gets hot, BUT it is really LOUD!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this spa mat for two years now and not only is it loud, but the bubbles are way too strong for relaxing (even on the low setting). Your limbs get knocked all over the place and, if you attempt to read a book with it on, it will certainly get wet. I was planning on returning it until I discovered my parrot absolutely loves it and constantly attempts to visit her &#x27;friend&#x27; in the bathroom. Her favorite activity is to sit on my shoulder with hardly any water in the tub (since she&#x27;s clumsy) and this thing going on full blast, sounds pretty fun right? So although I would probably only give it two stars, it gets an extra one just for the sheer bath-time listening pleasure it provides for birds. (If I may have seriously sold you on this for your parrot, make sure you get the one without heat, no reason to take the chance of Teflon on the poor creatures- mine is the older version). Also, the mat is hard to clean if it&#x27;s not kept meticulously dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and was quite disappointed in it. It does not stick to the bottom of the tub.  I could never figuire out how to work the remote. And it was entirely to loud to promote relaxation.  It did however provide tons of bubbles and you really feel like your in a jacuzzi tub, but if I could return it I would.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone last year.  It has since been returned. Setting up this unit was easy as well and taking it apart for storage.  Storage is another thing though... You will need somewhere to put this unit when it&#x27;s dry and it&#x27;s a big *bulky*.  Consider your storage before you purchase.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue, by far is the noise this unit produces.  That was the reason it was returned.  There is an unbelieveable amount of noise associated with it.  Perhaps it is several factors besides the actual very loud motor.  Most bathrooms are tile floored, and not very acustic on the walls.  But that is the exception not the rule and should somehow be anticipated into the design.  It is so loud I would have to consider it a design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;The person who I got this for said being in a tub with this on was a bit like being on a 747 landing strip.  Assuming they were being dramatic, I tried it myself.  There was no drama.  It was so loud as to cancel out any relaxing benefits...in fact you could hear the noise of this on the floor below the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, I purchased this unit from a shopping on tv option where they had MANY of these units running.  How they managed to muffle all that sound was beyond me.  I am still wondering about that little feat of special effects.&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself worked quite well and it&#x27;s just too bad that this one flaw was so problematic.  In the future I will be more careful about this issue when shopping for similar items.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews I was alittle wary on buying the product, but after months I bought it anyways. I had no problems with the suctions cups sticking (I got the tub wet first and step all over the mat to ensure suction before starting the bath). Although I agree they should have provided bigger suction cups. The motor is pretty loud, especially on high or during the program - my husband stated we should have just reversed our vaccum. However being such a large motor, it did produce alot of bubbles.  Our heat option felt pretty cool, maybe I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to warm up. The cleaning process was a piece of cake - I don&#x27;t really understand all the complaints. All in all, I&#x27;m glad I got it -- it makes a decent jacuzzi bath for those who don&#x27;t have one.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a birthday gift from my husband and was not happy with the spa mat. I can&#x27;t keep the mat to stay on the bottom of the bathtub. I have to hold it down with my feet. The hose that attaches to the mat does not stay in the mat. As soon as you turn the machine on high it blows off the mat resulting in water spraying all over the floor. I would NOT recomend this as a very relaxing way to spend a free evening and am very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I,too was excited to receive what I refer to as my White Trash Jacuzzi. Couldn&#x27;t wait to lay back in the tub after a long day on the farm. Much to my disapointment the suction cups DO NOT STICK to my tub. I thought it may have been a problem with soap buildup.  Scrubbed the tub Still didn&#x27;t stick. However the 3 large pieces with huge suction cups stick very nicely. Wonder why the tennie tiny ones were even put there to start with? Don&#x27;t waste the money on buying one with the small suction cups as I know of no one that it works for. The place where the hose attaches to the mat never stayed, only long enough to get layed back. Noise also was a problem. Couldn&#x27;t hear a thing and could wake sleeping children. My suggestion: Don&#x27;t use duct tape and Start saving for a real tub</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I love spas and I figured it was an affordable alternative.  It worked for the most part, but it shot cold bubbles and did not stick to the bottom of my tub.  It will only stick if you have an old timey porcelan tub, if there are any grooves to prevent you from slipping, it will not stick and will float to the top.  I was trying to enjoy my spa experience, but had limbs everywhere trying to hold it down and meanwhile my water was getting cold.  I did not think it was worth the money.  It was a good idea, I just wish they could make it work better.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, but it is very difficult to keep the suction cups in place.</li>
    <li> I had issues with the seller (through Amazon) when I bought this at first because it came used, with a dirty mat covered in soap scum, and without the remote when I didn&#x27;t see any of that in the description (this review is for the product, not the seller, so my rating is based on the product).  I returned it and bought the same exact model on eBay.  Again it was used but was at least clean and had the remote.  Apparently this model hasn&#x27;t been made in so long that brand new units are no longer available, so be aware of that.  That said, I&#x27;ve had it for nine months and use it in a garden tub weekly.  I don&#x27;t have enough of a problem with the mat sticking to the bottom of the tub to complain although it does sometimes come up.  Just wet the bottom of the tub, lie the mat down, and walk over it before filling the tub to get the suction cups to stick really well.  The unit is a LOT louder than a Jacuzzi tub and produces a lot of bubble-crackle noise on top of that, so although it&#x27;s not a calm quiet experience it&#x27;s bubble strength is stronger and more massaging than any Jacuzzi jets I&#x27;ve ever felt; I recently took a weekend road trip and booked a room with a Jacuzzi tub just so I wouldn&#x27;t miss my weekend soak, and was disappointed in the tub after using this mat.  I just use headphones to listen to music when I use it and voila, noise problem solved.  This mat bubbles up all around you and makes it feel like you&#x27;ve got 100 Jacuzzi jets directly on you, when in an actual Jacuzzi tub you might have 8-10 jets that are really just circulating the water around you.  I was really surprised to feel so unsatisfied with an actual Jacuzzi tub after having this mat for so long... so that much impresses me a lot; I just wish they still could be bought new.  I bought my mat USED at $175.  Just know what you&#x27;re getting when you purchase and be prepared to sanitize/clean the mat before use, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from an unknown Amazon seller when the price has been jacked up so high for what may come in such poor condition.r what may come in such poor condition.</li>
    <li> My husband had 2 back surgeries.  This mat makes his back and legs feel much better.  We are extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> It has no problem making bubbles and the three speeds are fine. I never did figure out how the program option works since the directions don&#x27;t really explain it, but since this model has the remote it&#x27;s easy enough to change speeds without hanging over the tub. The problem is that the little suction cups dont stick to the tub bottom. Our tub is old and scratched, but the suction cup design should take that into account. The suction cup bath mat has not slipped in 4 years so it&#x27;s not that things won&#x27;t stick to the tub bottom. The problem is that since it doesn&#x27;t stick to the bottom very well it tends to float. If you move a little and take you feet off the end the next thing you know the bottom two feet of the mat are now floating and spitting air/water at you, then the hose comes off the mat. Now you shut the unit off and put it back down or try and put it down with it running. This is like trying to sink an air mattress. The relaxing bath becomes a wrestling match. If it would stick to the tub bottom I would give it a 4/5 rating because except for poor directions and not sticking it&#x27;s fine. Also the heat feature is nice because without it your water does cool down quickly, however after 5-10 minutes the hose does become soft and partially colapses next to the unit because it gets that hot. I&#x27;m not sure how long the hose will last. I will be returning the unit so I&#x27;ll never know that.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this Spa and I like it very much. It is comfortable to sit on and the bubbles are really relaxing. I had the Con Air Mat and is was uncomfortable to sit on. I also like the remote so I don&#x27;t have to touch anything that is electric. The noise of this is not bad. I have a whirpool tub at home and it is allot louder. I got this for my vacation home because I missed my whirlpool tub. I would recommend it to you. I wish it was a little heavier so it would stay down in the tub. It does float, but so did the Con Air and it was heavier. I can live with  that.</li>
    <li> I got one and I love it. The only thing is that the suction belts that come with it will eventually will break. When you pull the suction belt from the tub, you have to work with it because it does stay put. And it is very noisy. Also the hose that detaches from the main unit, if the turn lock gets broken, you are [messed up]. I found that I had to a rubber band(or similiar)product on it to keep it locked.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this a day after I work out at the gym.  It loosens my muscles up pretty good.  It also is really easy to use, and a great alternative to a regular old bubble bath.  I have no problems with the suction cups, either.  I guess I have two complaints though.  1. It is pretty loud, both the motor and the bubbles.  When you are trying to relax, that is not the sound you want to hear.  and 2. The directions says you only have to let it run dry for 45 seconds to get the water out afterwards, I usually have to do it for 2 minutes or so, then let it hang on the shower wall over night to dry out.  Maybe the directions are wrong, maybe I am overly worried about mold, who know.  Over all, I like my bubble mat!</li>
    <li> I have no difficulty with the suction cups adhering to the tub and, in fact, when not in use, I use them to hang the mat up on the tile tub wall, rinse it down with the shower massage and let it drain off and then hange there for storage--The motor unit on mine is small enough that it stashes neatly behind the commode with the hose reaching into the tub, which is right beside it--With a good extention cord and the handy-dandy remote control, this storage method makes it so this appliance takes virtually no space at all in the bathroom and doesn&#x27;t need to be gotten out and put away for use--Very convenient!!--        While it is somewhat noisy, I don&#x27;t find it to be any moreso than the motor on any other kind of a bath massage, including the expensive jacuzzis--I like to sit in the tub and kind of blot-out the rest of the world, so I leave the room lights off and put on one of those small, battery-powered tap lights just around the corner from the tub so the light in the room is very soft and soothing and the noise from the motor unit masks any other household noises--Frankly, after a few minutes, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all--        Because the mat is pumping room air into the bath water, it does tend to cool off, but I start out with pretty hot water to begin with and it doesn&#x27;t cool down too much unless I stay in the tub with it running for more than 20 minutes or so--        Frankly, my bubblespa is the most relaxing thing that I do for myself on a regular basis--Come to think of it, I think I&#x27;ll go relax with it now!!</li>
    <li> Wow, awesome! This was a great gift. I transformed my tub into an expensive spa. I love taking baths now:)</li>
    <li> Have to agree with everything that was said by the previous reviewer. The suction cups are useless, especially around where the tube comes in (where the air pressure is very powerful).  &lt;br /&gt;I also found the heat feature useless.  The air passing through the tube gets warm enough to make the tube hot, but by the time it gets into the mat the air is cold (if you feel the air coming out of the holes it is not warm).  So the overall effect is that it cools your once hot bath down even more quickly than usual as you struggle to keep the mat flat beneath your body.  &lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is a huge chore as well and cancels out any relaxing advantages this product might (but doesn&#x27;t) offer.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of a lot of money!</li>
    <li> It was atotal disappointment. Because of the way it works the bath water cooled very quickly</li>
</ol>
