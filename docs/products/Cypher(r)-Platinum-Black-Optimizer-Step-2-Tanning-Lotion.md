      <li>Great lotion, but after 3 weeks it was gone!Most lotion will last me atleast a couple months!</li>
      <li>I started with Cypher in a Purple bottle first as I am normally pretty fair.  </li>
      <li>but the pump action seem to be good</li>
      <li>This spring I went back to CYPHER because you just can&#x27;t beat the quick and beautiful color.</li>
      <li>The Cypher items are my favorite right now.  </li>
      <li>I had a much more noticeable tan right after 1 session.</li>
      <li>and I was so excited to see the price difference here on amazon.</li>
      <li>however I think the first Cypher is better.</li>

      <li>/&gt;It does absolutely nothing as ar as providing a better tan.</li>
      <li>Smells good and seems to last a while.</li>
      <li>I am returning it for full refund.</li>
      <li>I just love the smell of this lotion and how it really helps you achieve your color after just one use</li>
      <li>it is great so far I have only used it 5 times and love it</li>

      <li>It gives a golden tan that will make you the envy of everyone.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this product and it also has a nice bronzer in it that doesn&#x27;t look orange or stains your hands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this at my tanning salon for $150 (and that was with 30% off)... it has great bronzers and great anti-aging ingredients... I feel like my skin is worth the extra money for the best lotion since I am subjecting it to UVA/UVB rays.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few lotions and this one I like the best. I smells good and gives you great color.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference in tanning faster versus other tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning indoors on and off for ten years and have tried dozens of tanning lotions. After trying the Cypher Platinum Black I now realize that I have been wasting my money for ten years! This lotion is a true miracle in a bottle!! It is a summer at the lake in less than a week! The bronzing effect is immediate and long lasting and does not have that traditional bronzer smell. It gives a golden tan that will make you the envy of everyone. I am even able to lessen my time in tanning beds because my color is lasting longer! Also, my skin has never felt softer. I am in love with this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Works better than anything I&#x27;ve used before, and I have an incredibly fair complexion to begin with. You need a solid base tan before jumping into this stuff though.</li>
    <li> Awesome product totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff. Way cheaper than a salon.</li>
    <li> This lotion gets you dark and leaves your skin smooth. My boyfriend put me on and i&#x27;ve loved it ever since! :)</li>
    <li> This expired in only 3 months.::what a disappointment. 09/2015</li>
    <li> Great product! Great prices! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This is the best product out there! Enhances a deep dark tan. The product is way too pricey at my tanning salon but Amazon.com saved me 68%.</li>
    <li> Love it! Feels great on the skin, compared to other tanning lotions. Does what it says :-) Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this on amazon! Price is pleasantly less that the tanning salon n the lotion is amazing :)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  And thank you for getting it to me so quickly.</li>
    <li> LIKED THE LOTION..BUT NOT THE BEST</li>
    <li> This very expensive lotion only lasts 3 application and as heavy as it feels, it is 75% empty. I am returning it for full refund. A total Consumer Deception case. Amazon with all the negative feedback should have pulled this product off the market long time a go but for financial gains continues to defraud its customers and sell this product.</li>
    <li> The best lotion so far!  I have been tanning in the summers for 5 yrs!</li>
    <li> I just love the smell of this lotion and how it really helps you achieve your color after just one use</li>
    <li> If you get dry skin the lotion is wonderful for protecting against it. The bronzers work well with your skin to provide a natural looking tan as well, instead of that burned look some people can get from over tanning.</li>
    <li> This lotion gets me SUPER dark after the FIRST time using it. Great smell and buttery feeling on the skin... Will NEVER use another lotion... LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion gives you a great color from the first use! Only issue I had was the bottle did not work right away, I had to take out the canister to get the pump to work.  Just a bit of a hiccup.... I will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> Smells good, works great!</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have ever tried.  After the first use you can tell you are a little darker.  It does not stain your hands and leaves your skin soft.</li>
    <li> Smells great and color develops faster so I can spend less time in the rays.  No streaking or spotting.  But it is hard to tell how much product is left because of packaging</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this lotion. It expires in less than one month. I have used this lotion before and you can tell this is product is OLD and is not as potent as a 50x should be.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best tan enhancing lotion. Not only do you get a great bronzing effect, but it moisturizes as well.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product just because it is cheaper! Got it a week ago and tried once then i checked the expiration date and shocked!! Expired on 7/2014!</li>
    <li> I loove this lotion and the smell...totally worth the money...and an rebuy for sure...better spend money on something good and then cheap and bad</li>
    <li> I like it , I was told by the tanning salon it would get you 8 shades darker in about&lt;br /&gt;2 tans if u had a base. They also&lt;br /&gt;Said it had a lot of perfume when I smelt theirs and mine.</li>
    <li> This crap was $120! For a lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does absolutely nothing as ar as providing a better tan. My old JWoww purchased on ebay for $20 does more. You guys are smoking something to say this works. They sell you so are at the tanning salons that you start to believe it! Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sort of a lotion conneseur and this is the best lotion iv ever tired. Gives deep dark color. Great smell. And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. And getting it here you can&#x27;t beat the price! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST TANNING PRODUCT I HAVE USED SO FAR! I WORK IN A TANNING SALON AND I HAVE YET TO FIND A LOTION THAT WILL GIVE ME A DEEPER  AND BETTER LOOKING TAN THAN THIS ONE</li>
    <li> Awesome product get it try its wonderful you wont be dissatisfied. This priduct will provide great skincare while giving you a tan as well. Buy it today it is Super the Best tanning lotion on the market right now.</li>
    <li> I have used several tanning lotions over the years. The Cypher items are my favorite right now.  I started with Cypher in a Purple bottle first as I am normally pretty fair.  After I established a base tan, I purchased this item.  This item helps me get more color even after I tan, so I find that I need to tan less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tanning salon warned me about buying product online because then may be counterfeit, expired, etc.  The item I received is the REAL product and I paid 50% less than what the tanning salon charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is still able to breathe through the lotion so I can tan during the day and then go back to work.  The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t drastically change after tanning as some products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a tube/bottle inside the black exterior that holds the lotion. You can remove the exterior case and unscrew the pump so you can get all the lotion out.  I used a makeup brush to get every last drop.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion ever tried. Keeps tanning up to three days after applied. Great smell</li>
    <li> Great lotion, but after 3 weeks it was gone!Most lotion will last me atleast a couple months! I made my husband open it up so I can get the very last drops and when he opened it I was surpised to find there was a small tube inside the bottle and I was a little irritated with the fact that you think the entire bottle is full (like most) but it actually is about 1/3-1/2 full of the very pricey lotion! Bummed</li>
    <li> it is great so far I have only used it 5 times and love it and it does what it says</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Amazon!  I only purchase items that are backed by Amazon!  This product is the best tanning lotion on the market now.  I would never pay $160  for tanning lotion,  but  the  seller on Amazon  had this for only $60,  for  this price for the same at the salon is hard to pass up!  Delivery was fast,  great product,  very happy  customer!</li>
    <li> this product will definitely give you color if you&#x27;re tanning indoors or out. You will immediately see results.</li>
    <li> I have to admit i did not think a tanning lotion would make a difference,wow was i wrong,my tan is so even and my skin is so smooth,i also paid over 50 percent less than the prices at the salon!</li>
    <li> Pump was broken and because of the bottle design there&#x27;s no way to get the lotion out. It finally started working but it only squirts a little at a time which is annoying.</li>
    <li> Great it was awesome I just wish it lasted longer, small amout inthe bottle but you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I had a much more noticeable tan right after 1 session. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It came quickly and it&#x27;s lasted longer then buying it in store at a tanning salon... I could have baught 4 bottles for the price of one at a salon they also sent some trial lotions!!!! Great service!!!</li>
    <li> Was the real stuff not old either.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite tanning lotions. Also just a fraction of the price compared to tanning salons.</li>
    <li> I noticed a deeper tan and it has a great scent. Very expensive  but worth the price on Amazon. Saved $100 off the salon price. I wish it had more in it. The bottle only lasted about a month and a half.</li>
    <li> great smell, and i seem to be tanning easier.  I thought i would have a problem with having no lid but the pump action seem to be good so it does not get all over my tanning bag</li>
    <li> Never used Cypher products before but decided to try this and I can say I&#x27;m sure glad I did! After just 3 days of tanning I looked darker than 2 weeks of tanning with my other lotion. I definitely recommend this product and it also has a nice bronzer in it that doesn&#x27;t look orange or stains your hands.</li>
    <li> Well this is super awkward. I absolutely loved this lotion. The shipping was fast - I got it sooner than I thought, and it smells exactly like the other Cypher&#x27;s. This is now my go-to lotion. Also, under a black light, the bottle does something very cool!</li>
    <li> This came quickly sealed and in a nice package. The product itself i&#x27;ve already tried and loved it, but this was the best price I found it for. It&#x27;s more than 60% less than my salon sells it for!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I used Cypher products last year and after I ran out purchased another very expensive lotion.  This spring I went back to CYPHER because you just can&#x27;t beat the quick and beautiful color.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful, gives you a natural tan, and doesn&#x27;t leave you orange.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to get dark fast.</li>
    <li> Tanning roughly every other day, this lotion lasted me just under three months.  For the right price, I will happily order again.</li>
    <li> Long lasting bottle and gives you a perfect tan that lasts. Love the Smell and no greasy feel! Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I have watched this sit on my tanning salons shelf for a long while now and I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay 160 dollars for it and I was so excited to see the price difference here on amazon. When I received the lotion I was a little skeptic as to being cheated out of the real product and getting a knock off, but after I used this I looked twice as dark as I did walking into the tanning salon. I will most defiantly purchase this lotion again for half the price of what it is worth.</li>
    <li> My Opinion of Cypher Black.&lt;br /&gt;I like it however I think the first Cypher is better.I find that I get a better color from the first Cypher.</li>
    <li> Authentic product for less!</li>
    <li> I love this new tanning lotion it is my new fav! I have gotten so dark sine using it! Plus it helps fight aging!</li>
    <li> I was tired of shelling out $150 a bottle at the tanning salon every time I needed tanning lotion but I am in love with the Cypher products. (I&#x27;m polish and it usually takes me FOREVER to tan but the Cypher line is incredible and I see results insanely fast.) I was a little worried about purchasing it online as you are never sure if you&#x27;re going to receive the same quality product or possibly get an expired product but I was pleasantly surprised to find it was the same thing I have been paying triple the price for at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> The pump does not work. Did not find out right away as I was using up other lotion.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get as much color as from Mood Indigo. I do get color and love how my skin feels</li>
    <li> Love this product and it smells good!</li>
    <li> I looked at this lotion in my salon for comparison . It sells for $160 btw. I never want to pay more than $100 for lotion so when I came across this product I was thrilled to pay less than $70 with s &amp; h. When the product arrived I opened it up to find the label peeling up around the nozzle, and its freaking me out .In addition the color of the label and the verbiage does not match the bottle in my salon. Not sure if I&#x27;m going to use it. You live and learn.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the Platinum Black Optimizer as pictured.  I received the Cypher in the purple bottle.  I was leaving for the beach the day it arrived and needed it so I just took the one delivered instead of returning.  I saw this happened with someone else so I should have never ordered it but I will not do it again.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is the misleading packaging. There is not much in there.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the product.  Much less expensive, and works the same as the stuff in the stores.</li>
    <li> I do like this but I&#x27;m not sure if it has gotten me darker than normal like some reviews say. Overall I would recommend this product and the smell is light and not bothersome like other tanning products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my wife and she has had nothing but good things to say about it!&lt;br /&gt;I too am very pleased with the price and the shipping on this item.&lt;br /&gt;I will gladly buy again!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best lotion in the market!!! Gives me really good color every time and builds color for three days after tanning.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately....I am an avid tanner...although I&#x27;ve toned it down (no pun) lately...  I have used all the very best lotions and have tanned at several top notch salons over the years...This product did not live up to the hype and certainly not the price.. I didn&#x27;t notice any color change...At this time I have been using Ruby and Modern Bombshell both by Designer Skin...They are HOT lotions...They will tan you..They are less expensive ...I would not buy this product again...</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and I received it SAME DAY!! How can you beat that? I am an avid tanner and I only tan in salons. I&#x27;m naturally very pale and this lotion gets me SUPER dark. I have a half Hispanic daughter and when I use this lotion people actually believe me when I say I am her mother! I&#x27;ve heard some people talk about &amp;#34;plateauing&amp;#34; with tanning lotion but I&#x27;ve never NOT gotten dark with this stuff and I&#x27;ve been using it for years. FYI my salon tries to sell me this same product for over $100 so I always come to Amazon for the best deal!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It got me dark quick! Smells good and seems to last a while. I am pretty small, and I only use this on my legs and arms, so it has lasted me a long time.</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon where this lotion sells for $160.00, even with my discount it&#x27;s still cheaper purchasing online! I have used this lotion before, so when the lotion came I knew it was legit Cypher Black lotion. 100% satisfied, will deffinitely be ordering from here again.</li>
