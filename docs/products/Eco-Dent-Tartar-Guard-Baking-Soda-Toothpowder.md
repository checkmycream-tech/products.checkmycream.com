      <li>Love love looove this powder, specifically this one with enzymes, which is hard to find at my local health food store.</li>
      <li>I took two stars away, one star for the tiny travel size and one star because it was not even 3/4 full.</li>
      <li>I particularly like that these products have a more mild, less intensely sweet flavor than standard, commercial toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I just wish I could get Natural Grocer&#x27;s to carry this flavor on the shelf!</li>
      <li>taste and feeling are very different the first time around.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend their entire line of tooth powders.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll notice a major difference in your teeth and gums within a few weeks of consistent use.</li>
      <li>Side note: If you try the whitening version, use it twice each day for two weeks straight (solely) then alternate with one or two of their other tooth powders thereafter for maintenance.</li>
      <li>little bottle also seems to last forever, so it&#x27;s very economical.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also pretty costly for the little bit you get in the bottle, but it lasts a long time.</li>

<li> you&#x27;re not used to baking soda based powder toothpastes, it does take a few brushings to get used to the taste, which is a combination of salt and strong mint, but it&#x27;s not off putting or bad, just different from what someone used to pastes might be used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> At this point it foams a little.  </li>
<li> Can be messy, so</li>
<li> You just wet your tooth brush, put a small amount of the powder on the toothbrush, and brush away!</li>
<li> I was not certain I would like it, but I needed to move away from toothpaste products that were irritating my gums.  </li>
<li> At least that is my experience.  </li>
<li> So, I have to say that at first I hated this idea, but did some research about toothpaste and decided to switch.</li>
<li> so my bad,</li>

    <li> You may not think you&#x27;d like this.  But it makes your mouth feel clean and wonderful.  You pour a little powder into your palm and then moisten it with your wet toothbrush.  At this point it foams a little.  This has baking soda plus some enzymes for really cleaning your teeth, yet with low abrasive.  One day I used it to clean out the coffee stains in my mug, and it worked like a charm!</li>
    <li> Good brand, pure ingredients.  Have been using this brand for years.  One of the purist around.  It is powder, and I just puff a little directly on my toothbrush.  Can be messy, so I do it over the sink.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff but the taste isn&#x27;t great. It&#x27;s also pretty costly for the little bit you get in the bottle, but it lasts a long time. I make my own tooth powder with essential oils and I will add a bottle of this to make it more powerful.</li>
    <li> The ingredients do not appear natural.  See the label. Read the ingredients on the back in uploaded image.  This product contains many chemical names, and includes two types of Pyrophosphates.  Yikes!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tooth powder. It has great flavor and leaves my teeth feeling super clean. So much better than paste!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about these tooth powders. I have used Eco-Dent Regular Care Cinnamon, Special Care Tarter and Special Care Whitening, consistently for one year now. My teeth have never been so clean and healthy (and I had oral issues for years; all of which are now gone). I particularly like that these products have a more mild, less intensely sweet flavor than standard, commercial toothpaste. I highly recommend their entire line of tooth powders. Easy to use and to travel with. The small bottles last for months! You&#x27;ll notice a major difference in your teeth and gums within a few weeks of consistent use. A+++ product...and fluoride free! Side note: If you try the whitening version, use it twice each day for two weeks straight (solely) then alternate with one or two of their other tooth powders thereafter for maintenance.</li>
    <li> Try this and you will never want to use regular toothpaste again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what my friend said to me in 1998 and he was right. It tastes and feels great and I have super healthy teeth for my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also light weight for travel and iutdoor adventures too.</li>
    <li> This does reduce tartar build-up, but the primary reason I use it is to prevent canker sores. Until my dentist recommended I try to find a baking soda product specifically for brushing teeth, to reduce tartar buildup, I was paying through the nose for toothpaste free of SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), which is highly irritating to the mucosa of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and much prefer the feeling after brushing with this than with paste of any kind. It just feels cleaner and fresher to me. I&#x27;ve had a canker sore maybe twice in the last year... I used to get them weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little bottle also seems to last forever, so it&#x27;s very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste and feeling are very different the first time around. You need a lot less of this than you do of toothpaste...you&#x27;ll only make that mistake once!</li>
    <li> My teeth feel really clean after I&#x27;ve brushed after using this product. Because I have sensitive teeth I have to switch to a Sensodyne product for sensitive teeth after the 4th or 5th brushing using Eco-Dent tartar guard. I knew I would have to when I bought the product so I have to give it 5 stars because it does what it claims to do but people who know they have sensitive teeth need to know that they may have to switch to they&#x27;re sensitive teeth toothpaste after the 4th or 5th brushing</li>
    <li> I love how fresh and clean my teeth feel, and I know it isn&#x27;t harmful to me!</li>
    <li> When I started using Eco-Dent tooth powder I was not certain I would like it, but I needed to move away from toothpaste products that were irritating my gums.  Eco-Dent tooth powders do the job.  They clean, the mouth feels fresh, and it is economical.  This tartar guard product used in conjunction with another product--Periogen--does protect against and eliminate tartar buildup.  At least that is my experience.  You need to try it for yourself and see.  I would not hesitate to do so.</li>
    <li> This is not especially tasty, but it is nice and foamy.  Best part: it&#x27;s not a liquid or gel, so you don&#x27;t need to take it out of your bag when you fly.</li>
    <li> Lasts a lot longer than pastes or liquids, and it works great at keeping teeth tartar free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not used to baking soda based powder toothpastes, it does take a few brushings to get used to the taste, which is a combination of salt and strong mint, but it&#x27;s not off putting or bad, just different from what someone used to pastes might be used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a slight tingling effect to it.</li>
    <li> I liked this powder, but its so much smaller that what I thought I was ordering. I guess I did not read the description properly so my bad, but yeah it&#x27;s really tiny for the price. It works and tastes ok but beware this bottle size is IMHO really overpriced for what you actually get. I took two stars away, one star for the tiny travel size and one star because it was not even 3/4 full.</li>
    <li> excellent product , works real good.</li>
    <li> I started using this stuff when I learned about the dangers of fluoride. I used a few different brands of alternative traditional toothpastes- Tom&#x27;s, xylitol, etc, and finally landed on this stuff. I really like it, it takes some getting used to. I actually like that it&#x27;s not strong on the mint flavor for use at night before bed. Peppermint is a stimulant- and who wants to be stimulated right before going to sleep. In the morning I and a drop of organic peppermint oil for fresh breath and a stimulating pick-me-up! I&#x27;ve found this works perfect for me. I just wish I could get Natural Grocer&#x27;s to carry this flavor on the shelf!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and what piece of mind knowing that it does not contain fluoride or other harmful chemicals.  I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> So, I have to say that at first I hated this idea, but did some research about toothpaste and decided to switch. Since I have, I have not had ANY cavities for over 4 years. Before, at every check up I had a cavity and couldn&#x27;t understand why, I had the sonic toothbrush, the waterpik, I don&#x27;t drink soda, nevertheless, this tooth powder has been great for me, my gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore, they are healthier and no cavities! yay!</li>
    <li> My bottom teeth would always stain just about a month after my tooth cleaning, even though I am NOT a wine or coffee drinker. Since I use this powder, my teeth stay as white as I have ever had them. I no longer feel I need to bleach them. Love love looove this powder, specifically this one with enzymes, which is hard to find at my local health food store.</li>
    <li> It was handled well.  Saved me a trip to Philly Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My teeth have never felt so clean! The idea of powder instead of paste takes time time getting used to, but that takes no time at all. You just wet your tooth brush, put a small amount of the powder on the toothbrush, and brush away! The first time use of it felt like an overpowering almost salty taste (baking soda), and it was very bubbly. Since using it over time the strong taste has lessened. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few days, but I can already see the benefits. This leaves a clean, minty taste and removes the coffee stains!</li>
