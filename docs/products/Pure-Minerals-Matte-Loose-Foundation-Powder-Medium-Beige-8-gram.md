    <li> Very good product just as good as it&#x27;s brand named counterpart</li>
    <li> Better than &amp;#34;Bare You Know who&amp;#34; with an easier to lock shake out lid. Better all day coverage with no smear on my white work jacket.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product...ordered it twice now...</li>
    <li> container smaller than expected. Prefer the &amp;#34;essentuals&amp;#34; bare minerals. thought that was this product. Tricky similar name.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t provide much coverage</li>
    <li> I order this every time I reorder.</li>
    <li> Not the same color as Bare Minerals of the same color name even though it was specifically stated the colors were the same.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with this product. I have previously used another more expensive brand of this type of powder and this compares equally to it. I will order this same product again.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this mineral. It is not the name brand, but I can tell little difference in it and for a quick makeup to go to the grocery store, it is just great and not as expensive and in a larger container. I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Not exactly like Bare Minerals but it will do in a pinch.  It was certainly cheaper than Bare Minerals brand so I can&#x27;t complain.  If I couldn&#x27;t get my BM brand powder, I could certainly use this without a problem.</li>
    <li> Bought the Pure minerals foundation for my daughter it is the only foundation she will use. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Actually when I opened the bag it came in, it was all cracked to pieces and the powder was everywhere.  Not such a great idea to send it in a little bag/envelope...I have no idea what the powder is like unfortunately.</li>
    <li> this is the best foundation make up I have ever used. If  your skin  is senstive like mine. You will love it. it last along time about 10 hours. The colors shades are little too dark but not bad. Next time i will order a lighter shade. IT RATE IT HIGH BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as bare minerals</li>
    <li> Coverage is not as good</li>
    <li> Just as good as bare minerals but less expensive.</li>
    <li> This product works just like the description promises.  The color is true and it covers nicely.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cover as well as Bare Minerals</li>
    <li> Nice coverage, I am able to cover my dark circles and mask my 11s with just a quick brush of pure minerals. I bet that it is as good as the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; product. No fuss--no bother, and at a quarter of the price!!!</li>
    <li> This is not BareMinerals. It is also a third of the price, and you get what you pay for. It is clumpy in the container and takes a lot of effort to blend in. That being said, it is not a bad product, and the service is prompt and courteous. I don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again but I am not horribly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is the actual product. Has a sticky texture and my fact is actually breaking out after using it for two days</li>
    <li> I love the full coverage it gives to my complexion.</li>
    <li> Ive never had a mineral powder make my face feel sticky, but this one does. It&#x27;s just weird</li>
    <li> its same as bare minerals for 1/2 price</li>
    <li> Love this foundation covers well and goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product - love it!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I bought this as a substitute for Bare Minerals. It does not cover as well. This product appears chalky on my skin. And if I perspire it seperates on my face and leaves blotches. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love these minerals they go on so smooth and it dose not cake up but also covers well. The color is correct for the shade I chose .&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that I saved a little money for just as good quality as the store brands. Will order again as soon as I run out. Excellent product!!!</li>
