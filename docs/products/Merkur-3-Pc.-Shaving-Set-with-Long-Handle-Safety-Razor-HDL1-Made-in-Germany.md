      <li>I am really glad I bought this three piece set.  </li>
      <li>I bought this set 3 months ago and am generally satisfied with the stand and the razor.</li>
      <li>Best purchase I have made in a long time and worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Easy to change blades, easy to shave with.  </li>
      <li>- it sits just fine.</li>
      <li>The first was for mu husband who loved it so much we bought one for his father as a gift.  </li>
      <li>Both pieces are very sturdy feeling and also feel top quality.</li>
      <li>This is an art that is honed over the years, for sure, but if you really want to learn how to shave right, look up some videos (google videos: shaving with a safety razor) and get to it.    </li>

      <li>really like this set.</li>
      <li>This is shiny, silver, very pricey.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful, the base is strong and sturdy, it doesn&#x27;t falls to one side or anything.</li>
      <li>Still looks brand new.  </li>
      <li>The razor is heavy enough to get the job done with minimal effort from your hand and the finish is attractive beside your sink.</li>
      <li>The razor side is to narrow for razor to fit in and the brush side is also to narrow for the brush to fit.</li>
      <li>Looks really classy.  </li>
      <li>I was somewhat surprised that the bowl was not included since part of it was in the photo</li>
      <li>This was my first DE Safety razor, so I can report back later to let you know how everything held up.</li>
      <li>Until it craps out on me, which I don&#x27;t see happening any time in the near future, I will be sticking with this.</li>
      <li>A few months have passed, and I would now consider myself a pretty efficient shaver.</li>
      <li>Lost a couple of hairs from it, but that is to be expected from a new brush.</li>

    <li> Used it several times now and feels durable.  I know I&#x27;m going to get my moneys worth saving on cost of razor blades.</li>
    <li> This shave set is great looking. It arrived in good package with a lot of padding, and it arrived quickly. Everything in here is quality, and the matching chrome is a nice touch. It was all as advertised. This was my first DE Safety razor, so I can report back later to let you know how everything held up. I would do business again.</li>
    <li> If you are having second thoughts about buying this product, think no more. A few months have passed, and I would now consider myself a pretty efficient shaver. This is an art that is honed over the years, for sure, but if you really want to learn how to shave right, look up some videos (google videos: shaving with a safety razor) and get to it.    I use it every time I shave, and I will never look back. I have never used any other type of safety razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but the product is of solid quality, and it works well for me. Until it craps out on me, which I don&#x27;t see happening any time in the near future, I will be sticking with this.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving set.  The razor is heavy enough to get the job done with minimal effort from your hand and the finish is attractive beside your sink.</li>
    <li> Eh, might serve as a decorative item for a man who has everything.  This is shiny, silver, very pricey.  I returned the two I ordered, not practical, imo.  Then you have to buy the soap and a container for that.  Sorry, not for me.  Spousal unit did not think the razor had a long handle as advertised, just looked like a typical double blade razor of yesteryear?  Do men fiddle with such razors today?  Dunno&#x27; neither my husband nor son would.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, the base is strong and sturdy, it doesn&#x27;t falls to one side or anything. The brush is great and the razor is outstanding</li>
    <li> Awesome razor, and nice looking set to boot!</li>
    <li> Best purchase I have made in a long time and worth every penny! Very happy and proud to have this shaving set! Arrived on time and in great condition. The pieces clean up well when I am finished shaving and still look brand new.</li>
    <li> The razor is excellent, and the lather brush is decent quality. The stand is worthless; it lacks the necessary weight to stay stable when either the razor or the brush (each of which has some heft) is removed, and I constantly worry that it&#x27;s going to tip over when I remove either item it holds. Maybe if the base was, you know, *weighted*, instead of hollow with a foam insert, it would stay steady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, just buy the razor itself. This combo deal isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this set 3 months ago and am generally satisfied with the stand and the razor. However the Badger brush is terrible! It worked well for first 2 months but started loosing strands significantly. It feels awful when the strands loosen and stick to your face when applying the cream. Just buy the razor as the brush is a total disappointment.</li>
    <li> The Merkur safety razor works great! Got the hang of it on the first use! Brush lathers well. Lost a couple of hairs from it, but that is to be expected from a new brush. The stand looks sharp! A little tight on the brush, but the brush goes on.</li>
    <li> Nothings perfect but it is pretty close.  The brush lost its first couple of hairs but none since then.  Have been using it for a while now.  Still looks brand new.  The merkur razor is nice.  Easy to change blades, easy to shave with.  Only downfall i have found is shaving underneath the nose is nearly impossible to get close because of the size of the razor.  Had to get a folding blade to finish off that area of the shave.  Both pieces are very sturdy feeling and also feel top quality.</li>
    <li> Really nice set.  Husband likes</li>
    <li> This was the 2nd of these sets that I&#x27;ve purchased.  The first was for mu husband who loved it so much we bought one for his father as a gift.  Looks really classy.  He says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s weighted nicely&amp;#34;.  Gives a great, clean shave.  Very good value for a really nice shave set.</li>
    <li> I am sometime amazed at the divergent views relating to the same product..but here goes. The Stand does not fit either the razor or the brush. The razor side is to narrow for razor to fit in and the brush side is also to narrow for the brush to fit. I had the tools to modify the openings of both ends so I did a work around. The average person should not have to face this issue. Some people have not mentioned this so it could be a quality control issue. This is not a compatible set. I would give the razor and brush a solid 4…but would downgrade to a 1 to bring attention to this defect.</li>
    <li> I bet my coworkers and friends wish that I would shut up about how great shaving with a DE razor is. But it&#x27;s so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this set. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s unbalanced without the razor in the stand - it sits just fine. The brush holder is a little tight but I imagine that&#x27;s for good reason. The brush itself I haven&#x27;t used yet (still using the last bit of a can I already had).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is excellent so far after 6-7 uses.</li>
    <li> All men should go retro you get a great shave and save money!</li>
    <li> I am really glad I bought this three piece set.  It gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and will not give it up.</li>
    <li> Nice set for the price. Shaving with a DE razor takes a little time getting used to however I am happy I made the switch. I was somewhat surprised that the bowl was not included since part of it was in the photo however I must not have read the description well enough.</li>
