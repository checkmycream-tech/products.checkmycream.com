      <li>This rose water has helped my issues immensely.</li>
      <li>not sure why I tried something new but very happy I did.</li>
      <li>This toner has been keeping my skin soft, nice and keeping my brown spots and acne down and most important thing</li>
      <li>; I got a little trigger happy with it and used a lot when it first arrived.</li>
      <li>I use it before I go to bed and right after a shower.</li>
      <li>I like to spray it all over my body right after the shower, after a workout, and before bedtime.</li>
      <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and it hit the spot just right.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast (thanks to prime) and it was secure in bubble wrap since the bottle is made of glass.</li>
      <li>Cooling on face in the hot and humid Texas weather.  </li>
      <li>I will be buying more, especially since I use it so often.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the rose water toner for a week, but my skin is clear for the first time in 10+ years.</li>
      <li>I can actually feel my pores becoming unblocked.</li>
      <li>The smell is lite, yet strong; hours later, I could still smell it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have natural hair which can be dry, so I have been using this rose water to rehydrate my hair throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is really doing anything for my complexion</li>
      <li>and I have noticed that I am not getting really oily during the day.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin when the weather is very humid out</li>

      <li>This has really helped balance my skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It really helps tightening my pores and improving my breakouts a lot.</li>
      <li>In the mornings instead of using a heavy moisturizer, I use the rose water.  </li>
      <li>My senses of smell must have been strong the first day I tried it due to allergies.  </li>
      <li>I have been using rose water as part of my beauty regimen for the past month.  </li>
      <li>My only wish is that it would come out in a finer mist, the spray is pretty strong and not a gentle spray.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very naturally invigorating.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin!</li>
      <li>I have only had occasion to use it for a short time, but am excited on experiencing all of the benefits.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for new facial moisturizers to try — my family has a history of dry skin, and living in a state where air conditioning everywhere only exacerbates this hereditary condition leaves me on the hunt for a newer and better product.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and would definitely recommend to try it</li>
      <li>and my face feels alive after I have used it.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve had oily, acne-prone skin since I was a teenager and have tried every product on the market with little success.</li>
      <li>I plan on purchasing another bottle for my teen daughter so she can use it as a moisturizer and to help clear her skin as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s now the next day and my chest is back to its normal color.</li>

    <li> Love, love love, rose water!  I have been using rose water as part of my beauty regimen for the past month.  Not only does my skin look fantastic, but my hair now craves it.  For my face, I keep it in my purse, so I can spritz my face when it feels dry (it is 100 degrees here in the South today).  In the mornings instead of using a heavy moisturizer, I use the rose water.  I have natural hair which can be dry, so I have been using this rose water to rehydrate my hair throughout the day.  Fabulous addition to my beauty regimen that keeps both my hair and skin looking great!</li>
    <li> Rose Water is one of the most versatile and effective products on the market. I could tell you so many things about it, but the most important points to know include:&lt;br /&gt;- its uses for cooking make so many desserts and recipes more delicious.&lt;br /&gt;- I have used it as a perfume. The delicate fragrance is wonderful for people like myself who are sensitive to most fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few different rose waters and this one is the best mix of mild and constantly effective. Everything I have read shows that this is the best seller to buy this from and I have been more than happy with my purchase. I will be buying more, especially since I use it so often.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  We had a particularly humid week in New York City and my skin always suffers when switching from a contained environment of air conditioning and a non-contained atmosphere of humid rankness and pollution. I carried this with me and it helped refresh my skin instantly. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and it hit the spot just right.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is really doing anything for my complexion but it smells heavenly. I like to spray it all over my body right after the shower, after a workout, and before bedtime. It has a calming and refreshing cool smell and feel. It has yet to fix my big pores, but it has actually improved my underarms by reducing razor burn and even making me need less deodorant...</li>
    <li> No problems with delivery.  Feels nice sprayed on my face.  Cooling on face in the hot and humid Texas weather.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product it smells so fresh and my face feels alive after I have used it. I was using a very expensive product for years not sure why I tried something new but very happy I did. Will buy this spray again.</li>
    <li> The rose water smells very nice. It really helps tightening my pores and improving my breakouts a lot. Love Bleu Beaute Organics rose water. I&#x27;m thinking about trying their Rosehip oil for my acne scar.</li>
    <li> This has really helped balance my skin. My skin is very sensitive, and I deal with horrible, hormonal acne. This rose water has helped my issues immensely.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, my wife uses this and can&#x27;t stop talking about how much she loves it.</li>
    <li> Really nice and refreshing facial mist. Smells so good!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely IN LOVE with this product. The shipping was fast (thanks to prime) and it was secure in bubble wrap since the bottle is made of glass. It&#x27;s 4oz, so be cautious when spraying it; I got a little trigger happy with it and used a lot when it first arrived. I couldn&#x27;t help myself though, I&#x27;ve been having breakouts on my chest which has led to some pretty bad irritation since I work in the fast food industry; however, with a few sprays and some patience, the embarrassing firetruck red spots on my chest went down to a soft pink (and that was within ten minutes). It&#x27;s now the next day and my chest is back to its normal color. The smell is lite, yet strong; hours later, I could still smell it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product truly deserves five stars and I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This purchase was the first time that I used rose water. It was something that my grandmothers&#x27; told stories about, having been a simple beauty and skin treatment regimen, back when they were growing up.  I love the fresh, light fragrance. It&#x27;s also very naturally invigorating. I have only had occasion to use it for a short time, but am excited on experiencing all of the benefits.</li>
    <li> Refreshing spray and a wonderful scent!  I use it in the morning before I put my makeup on and then after I have taken my makeup off at the end of the night before I do moisturizer.  Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase.  My only wish is that it would come out in a finer mist, the spray is pretty strong and not a gentle spray.</li>
    <li> I have a strong sense of smell and when I sprayed the rose water on my face and neck, I immediately washed it off because the scent was just too rosey and intolerable.  So I decided to take it to work and give it to a co-worker who can use it. When I was at work, I had pulled out the bottle out of my bag and I decided to read the info on the back of the bottle before I pass it on to someone.  Do to the benefits, I decided to keep it.  I tried it again by spraying a mist on my face and temples and hair and fell in love with it.  The scent was milder and refreshing and after the 4th day of using it, my face has gotten clearer and it somewhat glows. I use it just about every day. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t give it away. My senses of smell must have been strong the first day I tried it due to allergies.  I plan on purchasing another bottle for my teen daughter so she can use it as a moisturizer and to help clear her skin as well.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin when the weather is very humid out and I have noticed that I am not getting really oily during the day. This toner has been keeping my skin soft, nice and keeping my brown spots and acne down and most important thing it has no bad smell. My pores are not enlarged and my skin is just really smooth. I really think this would be a great addition to skin care routine and help to keep your skin looking great. I really like this product and would definitely recommend to try it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had oily, acne-prone skin since I was a teenager and have tried every product on the market with little success. I decided to order this toner as a supplement to my current routine. I&#x27;ve only been using the rose water toner for a week, but my skin is clear for the first time in 10+ years. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The item came quickly and was packaged well. I love this stuff. It&#x27;s not sticky and smells divine. I use it through out the day even with makeup on just to combat flaky makeup. I have oily skin so this provides moisture without getting more zits. I love how it is ph balanced. That helps keep more zits a bay too. Very good product. Helps with aging, irritation, and acne. I would recommend to anyone with any skin type.</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used rose water and I am in love. It calms irritated skin and I&#x27;ve been using it on my foundation brush and Beauty Blender too.</li>
    <li> Love my rose water from Blue Beaute I keep it in my fridge until I spray it on my face. Feel so cool &amp; smooth going on my skin.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for new facial moisturizers to try — my family has a history of dry skin, and living in a state where air conditioning everywhere only exacerbates this hereditary condition leaves me on the hunt for a newer and better product. Bleu Beaute&#x27;s Rose Water Spray is my latest find, and I must say that I have been very pleased with the results so far. I have been using it once a day for about two weeks now and have noticed improvements: my skin is moisturized without that greasy residue that a lot of lotions leave behind, and my blackheads have all but disappeared! I can actually feel my pores becoming unblocked. The bottle has enough to last you a while as long as you are not wasteful with the product, and the MOISTURIZER itself has a fresh, inviting aroma and feel. Rosewater is a great ingredient, and I&#x27;m happy to see it used in such a natural and healthy way. I especially liked how effective the rose water was at soothing irritated and rough skin. I wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone looking for a no-frills but effective facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> A great makeup remover. This rose water gently removes my makeup and helps clear up my acne. I also use the rose water to moisturize my face. The ingredients are all natural and has a soft and pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I used to use Evian mist but after reading about the benefits of rose water I wanted to try something else. It smells incredible and helps even out my combination skin. I use it before I go to bed and right after a shower. So far I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin!</li>
