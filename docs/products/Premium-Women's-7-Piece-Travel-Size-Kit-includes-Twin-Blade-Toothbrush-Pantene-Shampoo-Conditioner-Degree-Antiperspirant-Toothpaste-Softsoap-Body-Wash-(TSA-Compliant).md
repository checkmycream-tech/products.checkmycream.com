      <li>It&#x27;s a nice compact kit, but if you are getting it for what&#x27;s in it, don&#x27;t bother.  </li>
      <li>Good buy. :)</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this for myself, but I&#x27;m picky and would prefer to customize my own overnight bag for my preferred products.</li>
      <li>Definately comes in handy when you purchase amazon prime before hospital stays or vacations..</li>
      <li>Handy items.</li>
      <li>8 have added some of my own stuff to the bag but in general a very good idea!</li>
      <li>but on its own, this stands strong.</li>
      <li>They also included a zip bag to make sure no product gets in your luggage, not that anything spilled</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Pert, too.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a lot of better brands out there</li>
      <li>It had everything I needed and more.</li>
      <li>but it was nice to feel secure about spillage.</li>
      <li>I did love the fact that it fit well in the suitcase</li>
      <li>The travel size shower products were fine but the toothbrush, razor and bag are whatevs.</li>
      <li>Perfect little pack for traveling.</li>
      <li>I bought these kits for my kids who are going away to camp, and it&#x27;s a perfect little set for that purpose.</li>
      <li>Cheap, cheap, cheap.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife&#x27;s pregnancy, just so I wouldn&#x27;t have to lug around a bunch of huge bottles.</li>
      <li>Overall, I was happy with it.</li>
      <li>Worked great on a short cruise.</li>
      <li>I even added a few items to what they provided and it fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>But if you need something quick, easy, and cheap, this is just what you need.</li>
      <li>I bought it to pack in my hospital bag when I was pregnant and packing to deliver.</li>
      <li>I added a different better smelling deodorant and a better razor with replaceable blades.</li>
      <li>Works perfect and it&#x27;s small and ready to go in our bag.</li>
      <li>I can not use them now because they have very strict guidelines as to what can be used!!</li>
      <li>Great little travel kit.  </li>
      <li>I bought this Handy Solutions Premium Women&#x27;s Travel Kit for a couple day getaway that I am taking soon and it has almost everything I would like to take on my vacation for personal care items.</li>
      <li>Unless you are a frequent traveler that needs something a bit more rugged, this is really the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you were wondering, there IS a men&#x27;s version of this kit, as well.</li>
      <li>For what you get, this little bag is good for probably a week&#x27;s trip.</li>
      <li>This pack is a great deal, considering it&#x27;s full of actual products, unlike a lot of other travel kits which are full of empty bottles and cost more.   </li>
      <li>Everything looks exactly what the picture looks like.  </li>
      <li>The razor is pretty crappy</li>
      <li>/&gt;The products are also not as listed in the description, but I received exactly what they show in the picture.</li>
      <li>Exactly what is needed for travel.</li>
      <li>and I found this to be quite useful as I only travel with a carry on and like to travel light.</li>
      <li>I mean shampoos razors body soap deodorant and more what more could a woman ask for on the go all the time.</li>
      <li>As the items are easily replaceable, I&#x27;ll definitely be using this for all of my travel needs.</li>
      <li>it looks ancient and like 1000 cuts ready to happen.</li>
      <li>Plus the bag is very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Very convenient for travelling when you plan on bringing just a carry on and have to put your liquids in a transparent bag for the TSA Security.  </li>
      <li>like my other comment above this was a good kit but also found cheaper elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I like that there was enough extra space to add more items like Q-tips and my travel size contact solution.</li>
      <li>It will save you the last minute run to the drugstore to get products in the right sizes.  </li>
      <li>The mouthwash did fit well in the travel kit along with the other items that came in it.</li>
      <li>though, I didn&#x27;t get the exact same products as pictured.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t appreciate people advertising an item for sale with certain products and number of products and then receiving a different product and number of items, not what I paid for.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s actually a clear bag inside the kit which explains the count being off.</li>
      <li>However, if you&#x27;re not looking to absolutely maximize the volume of carry on liquids you can pack, then it definitely works.   </li>
      <li>I purchased this one for my 11-year old son:</li>
      <li>Toothbrush is SOFT, like what is this a pillow for my teeth?</li>
      <li>The bag broke the first night out of the country, the price was high, and not worth it.</li>
      <li>, I thought it would be useful and take less effort to buy this.</li>
      <li>I believe it&#x27;s a down right reap-off.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush was too soft and actually left bristles in my mouth and the razor weighed almost nothing and looked like it was two seconds away from falling apart.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product for my 13-year old daughter prior to a week-long family road trip.</li>
      <li>I would say that there is at least enough extra room in this kit to put one to two more travel size items in it with the other stuff that is in the kit.</li>

<li> I would say that there is at least enough extra room in this kit to put one to two more travel size items in it with the other stuff that is in the kit.</li>
<li> Almost everything you need in one small kit.  Very convenient.</li>
<li> but the amunt i dont think itll last that long</li>
<li> I bought this travel kit for a week long business trip in Europe.</li>
<li> There are only eight actual products contained, they are counting on empty plastic bag and the carrying case to make up the other two.</li>
<li> This kit contains a women&#x27;s deodorant, Pantene shampoo and conditioner, Crest toothpaste, Oral B toothbrush, Soft Soap shower gel/bodywash, and a razor, not sure what brand the razor is.</li>
<li> Otherwise, the contents were as expected.</li>
<li> So for around $10, it&#x27;s cheaper than other kits which is why I bought it.</li>
<li> &quot; x ~6.5\\&quot; x ~1.5\\&quot; (width is at the base, it&#x27;s thinner at the top).</li>
<li> The rest of the stuff matches exactly, down to the color of the toothbrush.</li>
<li> I did see it for less money at target though- under $10 at target</li>
<li> There was also room for a small compact, my eye shadow, and some mascara so that I could put all of my makeup in the plastic bag and not worry about it being crushed.</li>
<li> Instead of getting Garnier I received volumizing Pantene which would destroy my hair.</li>
<li> Waste of money don&#x27;t buy.</li>
<li> It has everything I need for a few days and item is just as described</li>
<li> One less thing to worry about!</li>
<li> It also came with a ziplock plastic bag, not sure what that is for.</li>
<li> I just carried this on my trip to Spain and it had everything I needed in one small space.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and has everything you&#x27;d need.</li>
<li> but I was lazy and wanted a travel kit mailed versus going to the store.</li>
<li> Wish this was less expensive.</li>
<li> That was disappointing, but I still feel this is a lot cheaper and easier than hunting down samples at a grocery</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great little travel kit.  I have used it on several trips now.  Handy items.</li>
    <li> Bought a case of them to give to an abused women&#x27;s shelter so they can give them to the women when they arrive.  Contains all of the things they need in a convenient bag.  This would make a great welcome gift for house guests too.</li>
    <li> Very good combination for vacations! 8 have added some of my own stuff to the bag but in general a very good idea!</li>
    <li> this is great and it even comes with a ziplock baggie for plane travel, though dont take the razor on the plane lol</li>
    <li> This pack is a great deal, considering it&#x27;s full of actual products, unlike a lot of other travel kits which are full of empty bottles and cost more.   However, I think the bag could be bigger and still comply with TSA regulations. It&#x27;s ~7.5\\&quot; x ~6.5\\&quot; x ~1.5\\&quot; (width is at the base, it&#x27;s thinner at the top). I&#x27;ve seen cases that are labeled as quart size and are 8\\&quot;x8\\&quot;x2\\&quot;. However, if you&#x27;re not looking to absolutely maximize the volume of carry on liquids you can pack, then it definitely works.   One note though, I didn&#x27;t get the exact same products as pictured. I got Pantene shampoo with the pictured Garnier conditioner, and a Nivea body wash instead of Dove. The rest of the stuff matches exactly, down to the color of the toothbrush. It also came with a ziplock plastic bag, not sure what that is for. Also, the picture has a cardboard insert that says it&#x27;s 10 piece, but there are not 10 pieces in there. No biggie, it comes with everything it says it does.</li>
    <li> I got this for an upcoming trip. Mine contained Pantene Shampoo, Garnier conditioner, Nivea body wash, then the toothpaste, toothbrush, degree deoderant, and razor.  It&#x27;s a nice compact kit, but if you are getting it for what&#x27;s in it, don&#x27;t bother.  It says 10 pc but counting the bag there were only 8 pieces.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for vacation and it worked out great!  Almost everything you need in one small kit.  Very convenient.</li>
    <li> For what you get, this little bag is good for probably a week&#x27;s trip. Plus the bag is very sturdy. I bought this for my wife&#x27;s pregnancy, just so I wouldn&#x27;t have to lug around a bunch of huge bottles. Works perfect and it&#x27;s small and ready to go in our bag.</li>
    <li> Great item bought for an emergency kit</li>
    <li> like my other comment above this was a good kit but also found cheaper elsewhere. A different brand. I did love the fact that it fit well in the suitcase and I didnt have to shop for all the products.</li>
    <li> Your run of the mill travel kit. There&#x27;s a lot of better brands out there but on its own, this stands strong.</li>
    <li> It is cute and product are good for air travel abroad nothing very impressive.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t appreciate people advertising an item for sale with certain products and number of products and then receiving a different product and number of items, not what I paid for.  This item advertised 10 pieces which included razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, dove body wash, degree antiperspirant, garnier shampoo and conditioner and I got Tresemme conditioner and Nivea shower gel in place of the ones shown.  Also, how does all this add up to 10??? If you&#x27;re even counting the bag it&#x27;s only 8...stop misleading people!  The kit shown on Amazon that I purchased even says \\&quot;10 pc Premium Women&#x27;s Travel Kit\\&quot; but mine just says \\&quot;Premium Women&#x27;s Travel Kit\\&quot;??? I buy a lot of products through Amazon and have had great luck with the things I have bought but this isn&#x27;t one of them!</li>
    <li> Perfect little pack for traveling. It had everything I needed and more. I love the smell of Pert, too. Good buy. :)</li>
    <li> My trip to Illinois was well equipped with  this product.</li>
    <li> This kit contains the basics that are needed while traveling. It will save you the last minute run to the drugstore to get products in the right sizes.  One less thing to worry about!</li>
    <li> Exactly what is needed for travel. Perfect size, fit in plastic pouch perfect quite satisfied</li>
    <li> Unlike some of the reviews, I had no qualms with this product. The product count is not off because there is a ziplock bag in the bag. I received everything that was pictured in the product photo.</li>
    <li> Took on cruise with me. Had everything I needed.</li>
    <li> I needed this item in a hurry as I need it for a Hospital stay.  It has everything I need for a few days and item is just as described</li>
    <li> Wish this was less expensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good quality. I bought it to pack in my hospital bag when I was pregnant and packing to deliver. Definately comes in handy when you purchase amazon prime before hospital stays or vacations.. I did see it for less money at target though- under $10 at target</li>
    <li> I got this for my vaca to Puerto Rico its perfect. I didnt have to go all over looking for travel sizes</li>
    <li> Several commenters said they did not receive the brands as advertised. I can&#x27;t say whether we did, because frankly I don&#x27;t care what the brands are. I bought these kits for my kids who are going away to camp, and it&#x27;s a perfect little set for that purpose. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this for myself, but I&#x27;m picky and would prefer to customize my own overnight bag for my preferred products. If you&#x27;re picky about your product, you probably shouldn&#x27;t buy this. But if you need something quick, easy, and cheap, this is just what you need.</li>
    <li> This kit fit perfectly in my 22&amp;#34; backpack for my three month trip around three continents. I will have to replenish but it will do for now!</li>
    <li> This is probably the worst purchase I have ever made on amazon. It did not come as described. The Shampoo and conditioner I received were not as advertised. Instead of getting Garnier I received volumizing Pantene which would destroy my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it if it didn&#x27;t have Garnier. The toothbrush was too soft and actually left bristles in my mouth and the razor weighed almost nothing and looked like it was two seconds away from falling apart. Waste of money don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> So for around $10, it&#x27;s cheaper than other kits which is why I bought it. There are only eight actual products contained, they are counting on empty plastic bag and the carrying case to make up the other two. That was disappointing, but I still feel this is a lot cheaper and easier than hunting down samples at a grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are also not as listed in the description, but I received exactly what they show in the picture.</li>
    <li> No idea why this is gender specific; I am a guy and I found this to be quite useful as I only travel with a carry on and like to travel light.</li>
    <li> I bought this because i am going on vacation for a week... but the amunt i dont think itll last that long and the bottles are not refillable... wish they were.  but on the plus side: its quality product</li>
    <li> the items that were advertised were not included in this item I received 20 of these for a fundraiser for the Ronald McDonald house I&#x27;m doing and the did not included advertised items. I can not use them now because they have very strict guidelines as to what can be used!!</li>
    <li> What a ding-dong move on my part. I don&#x27;t know why I bought this, I thought it would be useful and take less effort to buy this. The travel size shower products were fine but the toothbrush, razor and bag are whatevs. The razor is scary looking...it looks ancient and like 1000 cuts ready to happen. I threw it out. Toothbrush is SOFT, like what is this a pillow for my teeth? Cheap, cheap, cheap. Make your own travel bag (which I ended up doing anyways).</li>
    <li> I added a different better smelling deodorant and a better razor with replaceable blades. Over all though I used everything in it!</li>
    <li> I just carried this on my trip to Spain and it had everything I needed in one small space.</li>
    <li> Used for a hospital stay. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Everything looks exactly what the picture looks like.  I like that there was enough extra space to add more items like Q-tips and my travel size contact solution.</li>
    <li> This product is too expense for what is in the package. I believe it&#x27;s a down right reap-off.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s actually a clear bag inside the kit which explains the count being off. Otherwise, the contents were as expected. The razor is pretty crappy but I was lazy and wanted a travel kit mailed versus going to the store. Overall, I was happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this Handy Solutions Premium Women&#x27;s Travel Kit for a couple day getaway that I am taking soon and it has almost everything I would like to take on my vacation for personal care items. This kit does not contain mouthwash so I bought a separate travel size mouthwash because it is a must have for me. The mouthwash did fit well in the travel kit along with the other items that came in it. I would say that there is at least enough extra room in this kit to put one to two more travel size items in it with the other stuff that is in the kit. This kit contains a women&#x27;s deodorant, Pantene shampoo and conditioner, Crest toothpaste, Oral B toothbrush, Soft Soap shower gel/bodywash, and a razor, not sure what brand the razor is. Overall I would recommend this product but I am not sure that all of these travel kits will contain the exact items I listed but the items I listed are what I received in the kit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my 13-year old daughter prior to a week-long family road trip. Its got all of the essentials in it, so you don&#x27;t have to make the rounds to the stores to pick up items to fill it. Yes, it IS a utilitarian item. It&#x27;s not a beauty kit or a luxury kit by any means. It is a simple, cost-effective method of getting the items you need for a family vacation, a camping trip, or a longish business trip. Unless you are a frequent traveler that needs something a bit more rugged, this is really the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you were wondering, there IS a men&#x27;s version of this kit, as well. I purchased this one for my 11-year old son: [[ASIN:B0030HO592 Handy Solutions, 10 pc. Premium Men&#x27;s Travel Kit]]</li>
    <li> Price is right, All items are quality items and perfect for travel or as an addition to all my families emergency car kits</li>
    <li> had everything you needed for the woman on the go traveling I mean shampoos razors body soap deodorant and more what more could a woman ask for on the go all the time.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner were not as listed they were a pantene product which isn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Perfect traveling kit, I went overseas for 10 days and it was the perfect size. I even had product left over at the end of my trip. No problem going through security. They also included a zip bag to make sure no product gets in your luggage, not that anything spilled but it was nice to feel secure about spillage.</li>
    <li> great for travelling. Didnt include all the products i needed but the quality of the products were good, except the razor.</li>
    <li> If you count the toothbrush holder and bag, there are only 9 pieces to this 10 piece set.  Suave body wash is what I received.</li>
    <li> I purchase one of these for my husband and myself. I never use these products and would never make this purchase again. The bag broke the first night out of the country, the price was high, and not worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got what u need in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Very convenient for travelling when you plan on bringing just a carry on and have to put your liquids in a transparent bag for the TSA Security.  I even added a few items to what they provided and it fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Was perfect for my daughter&#x27;s camping trip!</li>
    <li> I bought this travel kit for a week long business trip in Europe. It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and has everything you&#x27;d need. It even had my specific brand of shampoo. There was also room for a small compact, my eye shadow, and some mascara so that I could put all of my makeup in the plastic bag and not worry about it being crushed. As the items are easily replaceable, I&#x27;ll definitely be using this for all of my travel needs.</li>
    <li> Perfect travel kit. Worked great on a short cruise.</li>
