      <li>Good product.</li>

      <li>The smell is really nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really been impressed with it.</li>
      <li>My husband liked this deodorant and had no complaints.</li>
      <li>What I liked most about this product was the dispensing mechanism.</li>
      <li>I like the feel going on, and I liked the citrusy scent, but I guess that might be part of his point---it might work more for a woman.  </li>
      <li>Fresh Awake fragrance is pleasant; it is nice without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It is not as comfortable to hold as the more tapered ones that house women&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried and found it effective against odor.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to use Degree Men&#x27;s Deodorant, but about two years ago, they changed their packaging and, I think, their formula as well because now the Degree causes irritation for me.</li>

      <li>We love Dove products and this deodorant is no exception.</li>
      <li>The Dove Men Care line has been a favorite of my husband.</li>
      <li>For us, this is more of miss than a hit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is no irritation or stinging as it is applied; best of all the deodorant doesn&#x27;t rub off and leave a white colour and powder on my shirts.</li>
      <li>Dove Men + Care Deodorant, Fresh Awake Deo is a good deodorant.</li>
      <li>This is a great deodorant for men and has a nice masculine scent.</li>
      <li>A lot of men&#x27;s deodorants have a very strong spicy smell to them, but this one is nice and fresh and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
      <li>Dove makes pretty good deodorant.</li>
      <li>A great choice for new deodorant user.</li>
      <li>The dial at the bottom clicks to make it easy to move from tier to tier of gel and the cap also snugly fits on with a refreshing &#x27;click&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and more herbal than spicy.</li>
      <li>It creates a nice balance that should keep you smelling fresh</li>
      <li>You can easily use this deodorant with cologne , its not an overpowering  scent.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and didn&#x27;t rub off on my shirt.</li>
      <li>the lid stays on and the twist mechanism is easy to turn in order to raise the unused stick up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and he liked it very much.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, there&#x27;s amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>fragrance is pretty strong, no need for cologne!</li>
      <li>I love the fresh, clean scent and comfortable feel of</li>
      <li>This Dove deodorant has a great smell, you can use a normal amount and still be protected, and it comes in a nice big size.</li>
      <li>Old Spice was fine but the packaging of this product and smoothness of application and great smell really is what makes this stand out.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a very fine deodorant that I would certainly recommend.</li>
      <li>I switched to Dove Men+Care \\&quot;Cool</li>
      <li>While I expect this product to be more of an odor controller than wetness controller, since it is a deodorant, it did not do very well at either.&lt;br</li>
      <li>biggest plus for this deodorant is that the scent is much milder than many “manly” scented deodorants.  </li>
      <li>This is a men&#x27;s deodorant that has a nice clean scent and yet is not so strong as to be overpowering and have an odor that follows you for a long time.</li>
      <li>Eighteen hours after applying, I smelled fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent and keeps the guys dry.</li>
      <li>The portion is generous and lasts a long time making it a good value.</li>
      <li>This is not a scent I normally choose and it is very strong when first applied.  </li>
      <li>but I really think I am going to make the switch after using this fantastic product from Dove.  </li>
      <li>Mennen had one that was called Fresh Scent</li>
      <li>Dove Men+ Care Fresh Awake.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like cologne.</li>
      <li>but the product is worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s powerful but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or gross.</li>
      <li>To me fresh scent should smell fresh, not like a sort of perfume scent.</li>
      <li>It has a fresh scent that is pleasant-smelling without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a nice men&#x27;s deodorant that would last.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the \\&quot;Fresh Awake\\&quot; variety does cause irritation for me.</li>
      <li>Right now while the weather is cooler, my husband can get away with a deodorant-only product.</li>
      <li>However, my girlfriend noticed it right away</li>
      <li>For light days, this deodorant provides decent protection from odors.</li>
      <li>It smells a bit strong in the container, but when applied is less aggressive than most men</li>
      <li>Which is to say that I was definitely interested in trying out this Dove Deodorant for Men.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know how it would work in the hot, but I&#x27;ve found most deodorants work about the same for me.</li>
      <li>It has a masculine scent without being overpowering, goes on smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>First off, this is a deodorant, not an Anti-Perspirant Deodorant.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a better application, longer lasting, with no fragrance to annoy my always-active allergies.  </li>
      <li>The strength of the scent was consistent over time, but not overpowering or offensive.</li>
      <li>is that they tend to be gentle, and this Fresh Awake deodorant is just that.</li>
      <li>First of all, this is not an antiperspirant, it does NOT stop you from sweating and does not claim to do so.&lt;br</li>
      <li>container is easy to open, yet</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not your typical &amp;#34;fresh scent&amp;#34; it&#x27;s more of herbal fresh scent.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty decent product.  </li>
      <li>It smells very nice without being perfumy, and it goes on dry so that I haven&#x27;t seen any wet streaks on anyone&#x27;s shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Its scent is much closer to cologne than deodorant.</li>
      <li>The scent fades a bit as the day goes on, but lingers enough to be lightly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but when I used the product I found it really made</li>
      <li>be very effective.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He likes this scent, but not as much as some of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be the clear type or the white type.</li>
      <li>The effective protection against odor is long lasting...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very potent.  This will easily last awhile.  I don&#x27;t sweat much or stink badly, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine that being possible over this deodorant.  It&#x27;s powerful but not overpowering.  The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5-stars is because it&#x27;s very expensive on Amazon.  If I found this at a normal store for less, I would give it 5-stars when factoring the power price.</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant for men and has a nice masculine scent. I had a friend try it and he liked it very much. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be the clear type or the white type. It&#x27;s the clear type which never really feels dry to me. I think it&#x27;s personal preference though. The deodorant aspect of it really does last a long time. I&#x27;ve been looking for a fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like cologne. This isn&#x27;t it. To me fresh scent should smell fresh, not like a sort of perfume scent. Mennen had one that was called Fresh Scent and it was very different than the typical scent that most products for men have. I see these things as a matter of preference though, so since I think it&#x27;s a good product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I&#x27;m giving it four stars.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nice men&#x27;s deodorant that would last. It has a pleasant scent and keeps the guys dry. My husband likes this product because it lasts longer than other men&#x27;s deodorant. I can recommend this to anyone. It might be good for the girls.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is a solid gel type. It does not leave a gooey mess under your armpits. Also, it does not leave a white mess like your typical solid deodorant. The portion is generous and lasts a long time making it a good value. The scent is excellent. It&#x27;s not your typical &amp;#34;fresh scent&amp;#34; it&#x27;s more of herbal fresh scent. The scent is still manly but it could work for a woman too.  You can easily use this deodorant with cologne , its not an overpowering  scent. Odor protection wise we have found it too be very effective.&lt;br /&gt; Overall, an excellent product that lives up to the Dove reputation.</li>
    <li> For light days, this deodorant provides decent protection from odors. What I liked most about this product was the dispensing mechanism. The whole base rotates, smoothly dispensing the product. The deodorant is blue but has not stained or marked clothes. It applies with ease. The fragrance is light and more herbal than spicy. While not my favorite, it is not unpleasant or terribly noticeable. Although designed for men, it seems unisex. The container is a manly iron and squarish. It is not as comfortable to hold as the more tapered ones that house women&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried and found it effective against odor. My brother likes to take breaks from antiperspirants and is pleased with the gentleness of this product. Neither of us experienced any skin irritation. If you are looking for a simple deodorant that will not suffocate you with its manly scent, this product will satisfy. Recommended.</li>
    <li> We love Dove products and this deodorant is no exception. It has a masculine scent without being overpowering, goes on smoothly and lasts all day. My husband liked this deodorant and had no complaints. All in all a great product!</li>
    <li> Nice long lasting deodorant for your day to day use going to school or work.  Practically invisible upon application.  Not a fan of the scent but it is not bat after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not an antiperspirant.  If you plan to work out or sweat it out, look for a formula with antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> The rise in popularity in antiperspirant deodorants has made it harder to find regular deodorants in pharmacies and other convenient brick and mortar places. Fortunately, there&#x27;s amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this deodorant is that it lasts. Many regular deodorants work for only half a day, but not this one. The smell is also pleasant, but not overpowering. It creates a nice balance that should keep you smelling fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as regular deodorants go, this one excels above most of the others. I&#x27;ve really been impressed with it.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent product.  Just a little bit keeps me from producing any bad smells, although I&#x27;m not a huge fan of its fairly normal &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; scent; such things always remind me of a locker room.  I like that it is not also a pore-clogging anti-perspirant.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son to use, and he is not a fan.  There are two main things he looks for in a deodorant, which you would think one of would have to do with how well it works, but I guess almost all deodorant works these days, so what he said he looks for is a &amp;#34;man scent&amp;#34; and a dry feel going on.  This had neither, he said---it felt wet going on (which is probably part of it being partly moisturizer, which I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s looking for) and he thought it &amp;#34;smelled like a woman scent&amp;#34;.  I tried it myself, and I actually like it a lot---I like the feel going on, and I liked the citrusy scent, but I guess that might be part of his point---it might work more for a woman.  I will probably take it over.  However, since it&#x27;s specifically marketed for men, I felt I should note that I do have to agree it&#x27;s not really a super manly scent!  So keep that all in mind when buying!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love the scent - it was a little too flowerly for me. However, my girlfriend noticed it right away and she did like it - and she usually doesn&#x27;t like scents that either too girly, or too boy-y (like an Axe brand). So her thumbs-up is a point in this brand&#x27;s favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only noticed it when I put it on, and the scent didn&#x27;t linger very long. That&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a gel, which I prefer and I didn&#x27;t notice its presence like I do with some oily deodorants. Once I put it on, I could stop thinking about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s winter so I don&#x27;t know how it would work in the hot, but I&#x27;ve found most deodorants work about the same for me. My priority is scent and how it feels, and this did a good job.</li>
    <li> I used to use Old Spice but I really think I am going to make the switch after using this fantastic product from Dove.  Old Spice was fine but the packaging of this product and smoothness of application and great smell really is what makes this stand out.  The dial at the bottom clicks to make it easy to move from tier to tier of gel and the cap also snugly fits on with a refreshing &#x27;click&#x27;.  These might seem minor details but when I used the product I found it really made a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I go to the deodorant aisle I will definitely be picking Dove Men up from here on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells great and is not over powering.  It does not interfere with my cologne.  It is Winter time and I do not really sweat in freezing weather, but when wearing a sweater and walking around the mall, I did not perspire.  I&#x27;ve been using Dove deodorants for some time and they all work great.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This Dove Care is very hard to find in actual stores, I feel the pricing was a bit high but the product is worth it. Smells great, love the moisturizer in it.</li>
    <li> While I expect this product to be more of an odor controller than wetness controller, since it is a deodorant, it did not do very well at either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is pretty strong, no need for cologne! If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, this is a good product. For us, this is more of miss than a hit.</li>
    <li> I am not loyal to any one brand of deodorant. In the past, I have tried Arm &amp; Hammer, Degree, Gillette, Old Spice, and value brands. Dove Men + Care is a step up. Its scent is much closer to cologne than deodorant. It was also less sticky than other brands of stick deodorant. Eighteen hours after applying, I smelled fresh and clean. The strength of the scent was consistent over time, but not overpowering or offensive. Although it is labeled for men, I presume the benefits of Dove would be equally pleasing to women. This is an excellent product by any measure. 5/5 stars.</li>
    <li> I tend to have problems with the skin under my arms when I use deodorants. I used to be able to use Degree Men&#x27;s Deodorant, but about two years ago, they changed their packaging and, I think, their formula as well because now the Degree causes irritation for me. I switched to Dove Men+Care \\&quot;Cool Silver\\&quot; deodorant at that point, and have had no problems since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the \\&quot;Fresh Awake\\&quot; variety does cause irritation for me. It&#x27;s not as bad as with some deodorants that I&#x27;ve used, but I do feel it and that&#x27;s not the case with the Dove Men+Care \\&quot;Cool Silver\\&quot; deodorant mentioned above. The packaging says that it is \\&quot;1/4 moisturizer,\\&quot; so it is definitely a different formula and, apparently, one that I&#x27;m sensitive to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be advised that this is a deodorant only. It contains no antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> I wanted something with a nice scent (not too male-cologne) and that my husband would like to use. We both like this - he likes how it goes on and works and I like how it smells.  So we&#x27;re both happy.</li>
    <li> First off, this is a deodorant, not an Anti-Perspirant Deodorant. It is amazing the number of grown people who do not know the difference. While this product is not meant to stop sweating, it does a good job of it. Right now while the weather is cooler, my husband can get away with a deodorant-only product. As we start to move towards the 80* weather, we will have to move back towards something with an anti-perspirant.&lt;br /&gt;The Fresh Awake fragrance is pleasant; it is nice without being overwhelming. I can see how it smells fresh, but I’m not sure how it smells awake. It doesn’t smell like coffee or bacon and eggs. No awake for me! (Now I’m thinking about coffee fragrance deodorant….)</li>
    <li> First of all, this is not an antiperspirant, it does NOT stop you from sweating and does not claim to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest plus for this deodorant is that the scent is much milder than many “manly” scented deodorants.  It smells a bit strong in the container, but when applied is less aggressive than most men’s deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves no residue and did not cause skin irritation.</li>
    <li> This is a men&#x27;s deodorant that has a nice clean scent and yet is not so strong as to be overpowering and have an odor that follows you for a long time. It does seem to stop underarm odor.&lt;br /&gt;The container is easy to open, yet the lid stays on and the twist mechanism is easy to turn in order to raise the unused stick up.&lt;br /&gt;There is no irritation or stinging as it is applied; best of all the deodorant doesn&#x27;t rub off and leave a white colour and powder on my shirts.</li>
    <li> Dove Men + Care Deodorant, Fresh Awake Deo is a good deodorant. It smells good, and it&#x27;s not overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t make me stink like flowers or perfume. Unlike some deodorants, it also doesn&#x27;t cause me any irritation or stain my shirts. It gives me all day odor protection, but the claimed 48 hours of protection is a stretch. The price is a little higher than many other deodorants too, but it does work well.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is good stuff, like it.  But is it really any different in appeal, form, function, result that all the rest found on the grocery shelf?&lt;br /&gt;Well I cannot find anything that is really different, certainly not better.  I was hoping for a better application, longer lasting, with no fragrance to annoy my always-active allergies.  But the application is what I have had for years with many other products, and I cannot find one reason to make this new product my go-to deodorant.</li>
    <li> I’m very pleased with this deodorant. It has a fresh scent that is pleasant-smelling without being overpowering. The scent fades a bit as the day goes on, but lingers enough to be lightly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation with this. It goes on easily and didn&#x27;t rub off on my shirt. The only quibble is that it leave a bit of a residue that can be hard to wash off in the shower. Not as bad as other deodorants I&#x27;ve used, but there is a small measure of a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very fine deodorant that I would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is not a scent I normally choose and it is very strong when first applied.  But it is not an unpleasant scent.  Seems to be a mix of spice and musky smells.  If you like that scent, this product does it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps me dry.  Causes no underarm itching.  Goes on clear.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Dove makes pretty good deodorant. My husband normally uses this, but I am using it now because it prevents under arm itching. It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or gross. It works all day and smells alright. I am a regular Secret user, but Dove doesn&#x27;t leave build up like Secret does.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh, clean scent and comfortable feel of Dove Men+ Care Fresh Awake. It apples with no residue and feels great to wear. The effective protection against odor is long lasting...either that or my underarms smell naturally agreeable.</li>
    <li> The Dove Men Care line has been a favorite of my husband. It really lasts a long time. He likes that it doesn&#x27;t make your skin sting. He likes this scent, but not as much as some of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He highly recommends Dove deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Speed stick user for ages, and I&#x27;ve generally been happy with it, but over the past few years, their product has gone downhill...The deodorant almost seems watered down, and you have to slather it on, and it really doesn&#x27;t smell, and the odor protection is almost nil. This Dove deodorant has a great smell, you can use a normal amount and still be protected, and it comes in a nice big size. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> My boy just turned 12 and he&#x27;s gotten to that age where he actually needs to begin using deodorant.  Which is to say that I was definitely interested in trying out this Dove Deodorant for Men.  Especially as it lasts for 48 hours -- since I know he&#x27;ll forget to use it every day, at least at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about Dove products in general is that they tend to be gentle, and this Fresh Awake deodorant is just that. It goes on gently and doesn&#x27;t appear to be irritating.  It smells very nice without being perfumy, and it goes on dry so that I haven&#x27;t seen any wet streaks on anyone&#x27;s shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing this Dove Deodorant doesn&#x27;t have is an antiperspirant component.  It&#x27;s keep us all fresh smelling but not dry.  A great choice for new deodorant user.</li>
    <li> This is a good deodorant. The smell is really nice. A lot of men&#x27;s deodorants have a very strong spicy smell to them, but this one is nice and fresh and isn&#x27;t overpowering. It is a gel stick, so there&#x27;s no white residue that clumps up or get on clothes.</li>
