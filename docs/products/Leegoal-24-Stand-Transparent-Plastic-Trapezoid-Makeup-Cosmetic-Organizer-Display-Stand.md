<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would have loved this product if it hadn&#x27;t come in broken. Besides that, it is what they say it is and it actually is fairly thick material so I&#x27;m not sure how it broke unless the shipping companies were throwing them to the ground.</li>
    <li> Nice clean and not broken, worth my money!</li>
    <li> Perfect lipstick and lipgloss holders. The spaces are large enough to hold any lip stick or lipgloss that I own and the multilevel affect is great so that I can see what I have. For the price I would buy these over and over again. I even store my lip liners, eyeliners, mascara and make up brushes in them.</li>
    <li> Good product but smaller than I thought but still good.</li>
    <li> Im so in love with this product. I have no complaints. It fit all my lipsticks. It does take about 3 weeks to receive but definetly worth it!</li>
    <li> Was 1 month late, slot cracked and it was a waste of money and time</li>
    <li> This is also great for essential oil roller bottles!  - Perfect size to organize them, in fact, I bought another one just for that use.</li>
    <li> Awesome display case for my lip glosses and lip stains for my small business.</li>
    <li> The item arrived damaged. The shipping package seemed secure but the acrylic had cracked on one side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review:&lt;br /&gt;Contacted seller and they agreed to give me a refund. The actual product itself is very nice, I have tried MAC, Loreal, Maybelline and Revlon lipsticks and they all fit snugly in it. Lip glosses are a little wobbly.</li>
    <li> Perfect! My mac lipsticks fit, my covergirl, all of them, except I have 2 huge lipsticks that didn&#x27;t fit but I knew they weren&#x27;t going to.</li>
    <li> This is great for lipsticks and some lip gloss also fit - it&#x27;s nice to be able to see the colors of the lipsticks expecially when you have several of the same brand and they all look alike. Just put them in upside down.</li>
    <li> Love it.. it  came in perfect condition no cracks or anything..thinking about ordering another because i have so many lipsticks and glosses</li>
    <li> Just as picture. It took a while to arrive with some scratches and a little piece chipped off from the center slot.It fits most of my lipsticks and holder looks sturdy.Overall i am happy but it would have been better if shipper uses bubble sheet to avoid chipping or breakage</li>
    <li> It was time to get rid of some old lipsticks and it was time to organize my lipsticks too. So I ordered this, and it came like a week or so early than expected date. I&#x27;m super pleased and I love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome for lipstick, masacara and liquid lipstick!</li>
    <li> I use these to corral my lipsticks and glosses in a drawer. The acrylic is not super-clear, there are some swirls and some burls on the edges. The imperfections are minor though, so I would be comfortable using this as a display if I didn&#x27;t need it specifically for items in a drawer.</li>
    <li> My lipstick holder came today...I received it broken :(</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an ok product. The product was damaged / cracked on the side when it arrived. I think it&#x27;s from shipping. Seller did place the item in a bubble wrap but it still broke on the side (attached a photo for viewer to view). The quality of the product is on the cheaper end. The acrylic is a thinner type than the ones we can purchase from the States (Target, Ross, etc). It still serve its purpose though.</li>
    <li> Good product but when I received it it was scratched and cracked on the side I&#x27;m still able to use it but disappointed since it took a long time to get it.</li>
    <li> This item was so disappointing the plastic is not very sturdy the quality is poor. It took a very long time to come in, and when it did it was broken.  Def. not worth the long wait, will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Not a fancy one, not perfect either, but it&#x27;s a good product for its price. It holds all my lipsticks well. Clean neat looking. Will purchase again if needed in the future.</li>
    <li> It is light. I liked it.</li>
    <li> Love that all my lipsticks fit right in...</li>
    <li> it was for my grandson 11 months old. he loves it</li>
    <li> I like it but mine came broken with 2 cracks :( Packaged poorly</li>
    <li> This was the second one I purchased as my first broke after 9 months of use. I use this to old glass roller bottles of essential oils. Works great and for the price can&#x27;t expect it to last forever.</li>
    <li> Came early in perfect condition and works great!  Fits all of my lipsticks (especially CoverGirl lipsticks) perfectly and even fits mascara.</li>
    <li> Not strong plastic but still great quality. Looks great on my vanity.</li>
    <li> Its was broken not worth it..</li>
    <li> Sturdy. We&#x27;ll made. Just as pictured. Bought another after the first one came. I would definitely buy another once my lipstick/lip gloss collection grows.</li>
    <li> gonna need some more soon!</li>
    <li> This is very compact and has helped me get my cosmetics organized! It also arrived sooner than expected. For the price this is a really good product.</li>
    <li> The compartments are just a little too small so I have 5 useless chunks of plastic now :(</li>
    <li> I need more of these! This fits most of my lipsticks. I may have 1 or 2 lipsticks out of about 40 that do not fit.</li>
    <li> For the price it is great.</li>
    <li> Overall I really like these containers I got. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, and once they&#x27;re filled with products they actually look kind of decorative. The only reason I can&#x27;t give them five stars is because they weren&#x27;t packaged that well when they were shipped, so one of them is chipped. I was able to glue it back together but not exactly the same. Otherwise, really great product and I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what it&#x27;s made for and super cheap</li>
    <li> Exactly what I imagined.  Great value, an super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Works great... will be buying again</li>
    <li> This product is of good quality and was very well packaged and protected upon arrival. Happy!</li>
    <li> It was just as described. I had read where it would work for essential oil bottles, but it does not work for 15mL Young Living essential oil bottles.</li>
    <li> came in cracked but I guess it will still work</li>
    <li> This makes getting ready so much easier! I have all my lipsticks displayed so I can see the colors, no more rolling around drawers or stuffing them into bags. Great communication and super fast shipping from the seller, thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought but once I placed all of my lipsticks it looked AMAZING! And you can&#x27;t beat the price! I will be purchasing another one!:)</li>
    <li> Cheap, thin clear plastic lipstick holder.  Nice for being so cheap but I believe I found one of similar quality at the dollar tree.  Still works well, just isn&#x27;t made of the nice acrylic that I was expecting.</li>
    <li> The lipstick holders arrived quickly and were in perfect condition! This is a great product to organize all of my daughter&#x27;s lipstick collection.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is very well made, sturdy and hardly gets any scratches. I ordered two more after the first one I got. It looks very pretty on my vanity. However with time the bottom of the lipsticks leave a trace under. No one can notice though. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It holds my Sephora, Maybelline, NYX, Makeup Forever, etc lipsticks. So far I am happy with my purchase. I would buy again. The shipping time wasn&#x27;t too bad coming from China.</li>
    <li> cheap and broken would not buy again</li>
    <li> Love it, gonna buy more</li>
    <li> Perfectly holds all my lipsticks and lip products.</li>
    <li> Cheap but it was what I expected</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It was so cheap and works perfectly. Fits lipsticks of all different sizes. I think I will probably order another.</li>
    <li> Recieved item in good condition.</li>
    <li> arrived in about 3 weeks and in good condition no cracks going to order two more</li>
    <li> Sturdy plastic; mine was not cracked when it arrived. Once lipsticks are placed in the organizer, it looks much better. Without the lipstick, the plastic container is not visually appealing. For the price, it&#x27;s awesome. Fits well on my desk and every lipstick I own fits nicely.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My lipstick collection was growing a little out of control, and i needed more space, so I decided to buy this to get a bit more organized. I only use it for my lipstick, and picking a color everyday i very convenient as i don&#x27;t have to dig through every color.</li>
    <li> It came chipped probably from shipping but no complaints</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this acrylic lipstick holder. I purchased this after seeing it on several YouTube MUA&#x27;s vanity setup videos. If professionals are using this, it&#x27;s gotta be good... Right? When it arrived I noticed a 2 inch hairline crack towards the back. Was a bit disappointing, but it doesn&#x27;t effect the functionality and you can&#x27;t see it once you have it loaded. Will be buying another one after I invest in more lipstick to show off ;)</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner and meet my needs perfectly. I needed a lip gloss organizer that would hold various sizes of lip glosses without letting them tip over. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because there was a slight chip in the bottom when I received it, its just a thin acrylic container, not much to hate, keep in mind you get what you pay for, nobody is going to give you a muji container for this price, I have nothing to complain about</li>
    <li> Took forever to come in and was dirty and cracked all in the front. Will have to go out to buy something else now.</li>
    <li> Great for all my lipsticks. Great buy! Wish the bottom had plastic treads or something to keep it from sliding but it&#x27;s a great purchase.</li>
    <li> im super happy i have a place for my lipsticks and i can hold my brushes and other makeup too!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found an item like this in such low price! I have lots of lipsticks and glosses and am a self-diagnose lippie junkie and this is just perfect for me!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Comes in handy!!! Makes me look so organized!!!</li>
    <li> Great for organizing my lipsticks and lip glosses. It keeps my vanity looking clean and everything is in place. Great quality plastic, very sturdy.</li>
    <li> it is a bit smaller than ewhat you see in the picture, but it holds 24 lipsticks perfectly so I cant complain.</li>
    <li> This is a nice organizer. It holds several lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Awesome product a price</li>
    <li> I ordered two and both came broken. I tried to be a good sport about it and ordered one more but that too came broken far beyond use.</li>
    <li> Love it! Came in about 15 days</li>
    <li> it took a little bit longer to come in the mail. I ordered it around the holidays. I wasn&#x27;t able to track it, so i pretty much had to just wait for it to come. I honestly forgot about it, so when it did come in the mail I was caught off guard. I didn&#x27;t expect anything special with this product, i just needed to organize my lipsticks. It was broken on arrival. Some pieces were chipped and snapped off, but nothing big enough for me to want to go through the hassle of returning it. It did hold my lipsticks. I put a few lip pencils in one of the slots. They stayed fine. I put my lipsticks upside down so i can know which color is what. Like i said, nothing special. Does the job especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Cheap and did what I wanted. Slow shipping but for the price I can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> I am not one to complain at a product I buy online because there&#x27;s always that chance of not being happy. I mean it&#x27;s not like you can hold or inspect until you get it. With that being said, I still can&#x27;t inspect it because it still has not arrived 20+ days after I ordered it. I ordered this to hold my essential roller bottle to display at home and classes. Since I ordered this, I ordered one from another company for my daughters nail polish and it do to arrive next week....and I ordered it this Monday!!! Yep not happy here</li>
    <li> Love this! keep it on my vanity with most of my lipsticks and find myself wearing a lot of them more often now that they&#x27;re in front of me everyday. i definitly considered buying another one!</li>
    <li> Although this is pretty much cheap plastic, it serves its purpose and for $3 something why not?</li>
    <li> Took very long to come. I ordered four. One was perfect. The others had cracks and it was broken.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it !!</li>
    <li> Looks horrible!! Didn&#x27;t expect much with as little as it cost. But it is marred and foggy. Almost looks like it had been used and scuffed. Extremely poor quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect , exactly what i was looking for</li>
    <li> excellent organizer for lipsticks!</li>
    <li> when I ordered a it didn&#x27;t take that long indicate complete not crack not like the price of lots</li>
    <li> Nice lipstick holder for the price! It holds all my MAC, Mabelline, and NYX lip liners. Only thing negative about this is that there was 2 small chips in it when it arrived, but it does not stop in from being usable.</li>
    <li> Love this organizer. I&#x27;m using to organize all my essential oils in rollerballs. It keeps them all neat and tidy.</li>
    <li> I love them, I have a lot of nail art polishes &amp; this is the perfect item to store them in, I had to buy more.</li>
    <li> The lipstick organizer was good, but when I received it .... It has broken</li>
    <li> No real problems with this product. I just wish it was more than 24 spaces! Fast shipping and the holes are big enough for everything I need. Also, it&#x27;s very well made.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my lipsticks! I bought three of these! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Shipping took about a month and my item was damaged when I received it. Does the job nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering these and this time I ordered 2! I love them, great for lipsticks and glosses. Kat Von D studded lipsticks won&#x27;t fit in the holder but everything else did!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lipstick addict and this is a must!! I love having my lipsticks on display and being able to see them so I can make a selection. When you have so many you sometimes forget what you own. I bought two and still need to order a few more haha. The quality of these are great, they are sturdy and will last.</li>
    <li> I love them! They arrived in perfect condition without cracks or scratches!  I placed my order for 3 tiers on April 26 2015 and they arrived on May 26 2015 as expected.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this product in january and it is now March 6th, the delivery took forever and it finally comes in the mail and one of the cubical&#x27;s are broken. I am so upset witt myself for purchasing the little flimsy thing but I am even more upset that I waited so long to get this terribly made product. If I can rate it less than one star I would. It is also really small, I am really small, 5&#x27;6 and about 180lbs but my hands are reallly small and thig little thing doesn&#x27;t even cover my full hand. WORST BUY ever</li>
    <li> This was just what I expected it to be. No frills but it definitely get the job done. I will be purchasing another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ts smaller than it looks but honestly its perfect and stylish. It even holds MAC lipsticks which is a big plus</li>
    <li> Holds all my mac lipsticks. Really sturdy and can hold larger lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Perfect! will probably order a second one soon! fit all my lippies so far. Cant beat the price!</li>
    <li> This is a really great item that fits a lot of different lipsticks and glosses as well. I love it. It really helps me keep organized. I plan on buying another one soon. The only down side s that it takes forever to get to you. Or at least that is what I experienced. :)</li>
    <li> Love Love this lipstick holder, I always get compliments when people come over and see it :)</li>
    <li> Love this! Took a month to get here but worth the wait now I fit all of my lipsticks in there with no problem</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay fits a small variety of sizes of lipsticks. came cracked, but only a small crack on the side - still usable.</li>
    <li> Way too small for lipstick.  My intention was to put essential oils in it.  NOPE!</li>
    <li> LOVE this!  Finally a way to organize all of my Julep Nail Polish bottles.  The bottles fit perfectly!</li>
    <li> It came to house super early!!! The size is just right for all my lipsticks and LIP GLOSSES. I couldn&#x27;t believe how helpful this was</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I paid for. Will purchase from this user again</li>
    <li> cute easy way to organize lipsticks</li>
    <li> This is a great lipstick holder will order again soon.</li>
    <li> Use on top of my dresser to organize my MAC lipsticks and glosses.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. Helps me see the lipstick names easily.</li>
    <li> I like this. Fits my need. But you get what you paid for. None of my square lipsticks will fit in it but my round ones do. Its not really durable but its still nice for the price.</li>
    <li> My Victoria secret lipsticks would not fit into the have holes of this nor would my Maybelline lipsticks.  Nyx, wet and wild, Mac, and Mary Kay all did fit.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick organizer! Looks nice on my dresser!! Will also hold large lipgloss tubes!! The acrylic 41 holes organizer only fits little tube lipglosses. The holes on this holder are way bigger</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, but still easily and neatly holds 24 lipsticks. It&#x27;s probably better that its design is more compact. Wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Good quality! But by the time it got here I had already forgotten I had ordered it lol</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 and when I recoeved it one was cracked really bad</li>
    <li> I just got mine and it came in broken. Having trouble getting my refund! I&#x27;ve been waiting for weeks, such a disappointment!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a must have if you love lipstick, lip gloss or any other stuff that you can put on your lips! It fits all of my lipsticks, I do just wish the black slots were longer than the front slots. That way the tall lipsticks that I have wouldn&#x27;t look so out of proportion.</li>
    <li> Received the package after a month and it was damaged. There was a chip on the left side of the item. Not planning on returning it because I dont want to wait any longer.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for...received it broken ; (</li>
    <li> Perfect for all my lipsticks :) thank you!</li>
    <li> Was very small need more cases and cheaply made..I guess you get what you pay for right..other then that could&#x27;ve use two more</li>
    <li> I am so happy I bought this!  It fits lipstick perfectly!  I love how I can actually see what color lipstick I have without digging through a drawer.  I recommend this and may buy another!</li>
    <li> Will be purchasing more soon.</li>
    <li> Great organizer . I don&#x27;t have to look for my oils and lipstick everywhere . Great price and quality and space saver .</li>
    <li> I love these trays. The best deal on the market.  I am very please, and my lipsticks look amazing.</li>
    <li> For this item to be made of plastic, it holds pretty sturdy and strong. I currently have 2, they are just great!</li>
    <li> This organizer works not only for lipsticks, but mascara, eyeliner, makeup brushes, etc. It has been a key part to my makeup vanity organization since I purchased it last May. It&#x27;s really easy to clean, I simply empty the contents out and then dunk it in warm water and set it on a towel to dry. You can even throw it in the dishwasher if that&#x27;s too much work for you!&lt;br /&gt;I love that it holds so many different products because I honestly don&#x27;t really wear lipstick so I was looking for a makeup organizer and this fits the bill. I like that it&#x27;s clear because it fits in with any decor and if I got ambitious enough I could even decorate it to match my makeup area, but that will likely happen in the future!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value, you can&#x27;t beat the price and I&#x27;m sure it has even more uses outside of makeup that I can&#x27;t even think of right now!</li>
    <li> just like how it was pictured i will be buying more! My lipsticks fit perfectly in here and look so nice!</li>
    <li> I wanted something to organize all of my lip products and this couldn&#x27;t have been more perfect. I ordered two and I am considering ordering another one because of how good quality it is. The only downside is the shipping time but if you aren&#x27;t in a hurry I would recommend this product as a cheaper alternative to some of the organizers you find at department stores.</li>
    <li> Amazing organizer for lipsticks, liners and mascara.  Makes my makeup space look clutter free.</li>
    <li> It arrived cracked, but functional...</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for those who have a drawer full of eye pencils that get in the jewelry and all over everything. This was my problem and the organizer completely fixed it.</li>
    <li> style fits in small spaces on shelves dressers etc.</li>
    <li> I need another one. This rack is wonderful, not too big or too small and looks great. Shipped fast and really does a great job.</li>
    <li> It was broken when i opened it :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> Took a while it was worth the wait because I love it can&#x27;t wait to put my lipstick it in thank you ☺️😁</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking i could use it to hold my 5 ml essential oils, but the slots are too small for at least for 90% of my bottles.  Somewhere, not sure where, but something touted this as something for the 5 ml bottles.  Maybe not this seller though, so I can&#x27;t really blame them.  This does and would be perfect for lipsticks.  It is smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> The plastic looks and feels really cheap.&lt;br /&gt;But it does hold the lipsticks in place so I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> mine arrived a little chipped, but considering that the box is thinish plastic, I wasn&#x27;t surprised. And it&#x27;s not in a place that bothers me or effects the use.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and perfect condition! It fit all my lipsticks nice and organized! I am most dedenitely buying a couple more of these. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it and it came earlier than expected</li>
    <li> I like it and the product is just what the description stated.  The only thing is that the size for each divider is standard so some of my chubby lip sticks won&#x27;t fit. And some lipstick gets stuck in there and I had to nudge it out</li>
    <li> I Love this .... It works perfectly, it did had a lil track on the bottom nothing major , Keep in mind that is alot smaller than the pic but it does great job holding the lipstick ... I definitely recommend this product to anyone!! and for myself i definitely buy some more</li>
    <li> Made my life easier keeps my lipsticks organized and looking great. I will definitely be purchasing more</li>
    <li> Much smaller openings than I thought.  I was hoping it would hold my small bottles of Essential Oils but even the small ones will not fit in it :(</li>
    <li> perfect size for lipsticks, plastic is a bit thin but still holds perfectly! Amazing value for less than $4!</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick holder very much it holds all of my lipsticks in place. Highly recommend on ordering :)</li>
    <li> My lipsticks and lip stains fit in perfectly, and it has enough spots that I can organize them any way I want to!</li>
    <li> Love this, it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on my vanity. However, the edges are a little sharp and it chipped a little black paint off. Just be careful when moving it around.</li>
    <li> nice holder, wish I could fit my&lt;br /&gt;Thicket lipstick dudes but for the most part it works great</li>
    <li> Perfect to organize lipsticks and lip balms.  I love it</li>
    <li> I got this for my fianc&amp;eacute;e to help her keep her new vanity organized as she posts makeup videos on YouTube and she loves it! It&#x27;s so simple but, hey! It does what it&#x27;s designed to do!</li>
    <li> Took a while to receive this item - though I expected that. For what I paid for it, it&#x27;s sturdy enough and looks nice next to my wooden makeup organizer. Hold all my lipglosses, lipsticks, etc. Arrived exactly as depicted and wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
    <li> I purchased the organizer to store nail polish, none of which would fit, much smaller than pictured.  The delivery took a month to receive and if that wasn&#x27;t enough, it arrived broken.</li>
    <li> After having a bathroom sink full of cosmetics, I invested in some acrylic organizers. This one is perfect for lipstick or other small toiletries. (My Fitbit fits perfectly in one of the slots) Particularly love how sturdy the acrylic is... Should withstand the daily abuse of having makeup products taken out and replaced.</li>
    <li> So I recieved my organizer (and a little faster than expected) and well its pretty small which doesn&#x27;t bother me i guess, most of my lipsticks fits. But when I opened it I saw a chunck of it off. Ughh I hate that but other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> First of all it looks nothing like the picture . It is so small it literally fits in the palm of your hand. I&#x27;ve ordered a lot of acrylic make up holders that are made of good sturdy acrylic. This looks like cheap plastic but, I guess that&#x27;s what you can expect from most products being sold from China. I had no idea this was coming from China until had I had already purchased it. I gave it two stars because it can be used for its intended purpose it&#x27;s just very cheap looking. It should have been sold for under $5.00 because that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> I was happy about shipment came faster then what I expected but one of my lipstick holder was broken a bit but it&#x27; was okay.</li>
    <li> Mine came with two of the holders shattered. It also took a very long time to arrive. Other than that it was okay, held lipsticks like it should.</li>
    <li> Need to return...didn&#x27;t work for what I needed</li>
    <li> I use this holder for various lipglosses and lipsticks ranging from drugstore brands such as Milani and Rimmel to higher end brands like Urban Decay and Lorac. All of the various shapes and sizes of lipgloss and lipstick fit nicely and it makes them easier to see than keeping them in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of lipstick, and I have tried a few different acrylic organizers, and this is the only one that fits all of my larger tube sizes. As some have pointed out the slots on the outside are bigger which is ok with me. What I love about this is that the slots are very deep. Some of my other organizers the lipsticks and glosses wobble around or even fall out, I have never had an issue with this one. I absolutely love this one and plan on buying a few more to fit the rest of my collection.</li>
    <li> For the price it does the job. Small in size great for birch box stuff that needs a home or lipstick! Mine did come broken but I&#x27;m not worried about it as it was cheap and the crack is hidden.</li>
    <li> probably will be buying more once I start collecting more lip products!</li>
    <li> I have a bunch and use them to declutter my dresser.  I use one for lipsticks, one for gloss and lip liners, one for mascara and eyeliner, and one for tube concealers.</li>
    <li> Very affordable. Lipstick organization was easy and now I can see everything I have. Most of my lipsticks drugstore and higher end, went in with ease, with the exception of Kat Von D Studded Kiss lippies. I was able to put several organizers in one draw. Only complaint, I wish they came packaged more securely due to the fact that they have to travel so far; I&#x27;ve received two that were cracked on the edges.</li>
    <li> Had a lil crack. But perfect</li>
    <li> It was broken when I got it</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with the price and the product.  It works perfectly and they arrived before than what was expected.</li>
    <li> Came already broken , but I would purchase another with better material</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick organizer and I have many different styles of them in my room because my lipstick collection is so large. This one is durable and does the job just as I need it to. Great price, great value, will get lots of use from me. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Mine came in broken. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to get here &amp; was cracked when I recived it, but it still works well.</li>
    <li> Totally satisfied with the product and service!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my Jamberry nails!</li>
    <li> Im in love with the coco! 😂 it just so perfect for my lipsticks....trust me you won&#x27;t regret it . 😍😍😍😍</li>
    <li> I love that I can now organize my lipsticks in a more attainable manner. Its nice to just be able to grab the color I want, otherwise I have a tendency to use the same ole tube. :( The only reason I gave it four stars was because in two areas there&#x27;s residue inside the plastic. Nothing major but its still not what ya wanna see in clear plastic. I used Windex to try &amp; take it out thinking it was on outside at first. However its not, so that costs ya a star but I am pleased w product otherwise!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is deep enough to hold lip gloss tubes.</li>
    <li> Best u can get for such low price.</li>
    <li> This is a cute little tray. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t even have enough to need one, but since I bought one, I&#x27;ve been buying lippies just so I can organize them. Terrible, I know. I&#x27;ve thrown in some brushes and my lip balms in here as well. I keep it in my dresser drawer so it&#x27;s out of sight, but I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> My had a small crack on it but I&#x27;ll just see how long it lasts me. Good for the price</li>
    <li> Will be ordering another I love it.. seeMs so much more organized having it.</li>
    <li> I liked the product.. But I guess I shouldnt be expecting much about the shipping. It came more than a month later which was &amp;#34;expected&amp;#34; BUT my item came in dirty and broken...</li>
    <li> Love this! Will be getting more!</li>
    <li> Love it. Only gave it four stars because it seems a bit smaller than on the photo but I should&#x27;ve just paid more attention. Oh and also, it came with a piece broken off, but I&#x27;m sure that was the deliverer&#x27;s fault. Love it, even came early.</li>
    <li> I have bought many organizers over the years, this one is surprisingly sturdy for the cost. My biggest complaint is that the individual holes are a little small for many lip sticks yet too large for lip pencils. Also the walls around the compartments are a little low so they do not keep the lipsticks from falling over. If your lipsticks are the right size and shape for this product it&#x27;s great otherwise it leaves many lip products falling over.</li>
    <li> The price is amazing, the quality of these holders I give two thumbs all the way up! It looks so cute, clean and presentable on my vanity. I&#x27;m so in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits Mac, Limecrime &amp; YSL tubes comfortably.  (Yay!)&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to worry about your drug store lipsticks not fitting either :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue: I ordered two &amp; when they arrived BOTH were in less than mint condition. Several cracks and a missing piece near one of the corners BUT still very much so usable. The first thing I did was email the seller with attached pictures and within minutes they emailed me back &amp; said they&#x27;d gladly send me two new ones &amp; to expect them in 7-15 days! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my luck of course I&#x27;d be the one to have problems while it was shipped lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have a problem they take good care of you and I&#x27;m very pleased and happy with the product &amp; how my situation was handled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d still no doubt gift these to friends in the future!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nail polishes but none of them fit.</li>
    <li> I gave this 3 stars because I told it was gon be a big as tha pic and when I got in tha mail I can hold it literally wit one finger</li>
    <li> Met all expectations 👌</li>
    <li> exactly as described, shipped very quickly</li>
    <li> Fits all my lipstick and lipgloss. Light weight and sturdy</li>
    <li> I ordered two and my different kind of lipsticks fit perfectly!</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail 2day.. &amp; its perfect!!  just the right size i needed to put on my vanity!!  love it.. would recommend to any woman!!</li>
    <li> I love how these save space and make your collection easily viewable but one of the ones I received was cracked and chipped.</li>
    <li> Perfect ! Perfect price and looks supper cute on my vanity !</li>
    <li> Mine came with a little chip broken off but that&#x27;s not really a big deal, you cannot see it</li>
    <li> It had crack and some scratches when I received it</li>
    <li> This Organizer is so great, I am getting another one for my winter lip products. Makes it easier to see all my lipsticks and lip gloss no more searching around for my favorite lips product.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find one that was a flat row of holes for lipsticks, kind of had to settle on this tiered one. It is good quality and I&#x27;m glad to have something to organize them.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit most of my nail polish bottles. Way to small</li>
    <li> Finally my lipstick are in good shape.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter, she loves it</li>
    <li> This is a good value for the money, well made etc.  But beware, it is made from a rigid plastic that will shatter easily if mishandled. And while there are several little cubes,  I am disappointed in the tiny size of each cube. It will hold only very slim items like lip gloss, eye pencils etc. And the item is made all in one piece, so is not adjustable.</li>
    <li> When I received the product it was broken from different places. I was disappointed :/</li>
    <li> Great display!! Got it in a timely manner!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Saved space on my vanity, might have to buy more☺</li>
    <li> Way smaller than i had hoped</li>
    <li> These are absolutely amazing, and great quality. I&#x27;ve bought three more since I got the first one.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and useful. What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;Ok this may not be the most high-end looking product, but it serves a good purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend. However, don&#x27;t be surprised if it is cracked or scratched when it arrives.</li>
    <li> Love it! I teach first grade and my kiddos always had trouble remembering to put the caps on glue sticks. Bought this and, viola! Problem solved!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for the price. The compartments are pretty roomy, though I have come across a lipstick or two that didn&#x27;t fit well in there. It;s pretty sturdy and has held up really well. I ended up purchasing a second one for my sister. Overall, a great buy.</li>
    <li> I received really fast, perfect for almost all brands of lipstick.</li>
    <li> Mine came cracked and the plastic is old and starting to yellow :(. It still serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> Love it but not all my lipsticks fit in it</li>
    <li> Well packaged but it was chipped and cracked on the back row.</li>
    <li> It took a bit of time to get to me, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain. This cosmetics holder is as good as any. Fits all my favorite lipsticks and I can organize them however I like. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Im using it for my lipstick. If you are planning to use it for nail polish this is not a good one unless you have a slender type of nail polish bottles. Otherwise, it is very affordable and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for any lipstick size and it&#x27;s small and compacted will be ordering another one once my lipstick collection grows</li>
    <li> Took much longer than expected but was just as described</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this! It is very inexpensive and gets the job done. Mine actually arrived ahead of time with no damage.</li>
    <li> good quality. nothing fancy like the one from byalegory but decent enough to get the job done.  was a gift for a friend and she loved it</li>
    <li> Ordering 3 more!! They are perfect</li>
    <li> The side of it was cracked when I received it but for the price it didn&#x27;t even matter. Still did what it was supposed to do!</li>
    <li> I like this lipstick organizer, it&#x27;s very compact and has almost more space than what I need. I ended up putting my makeup brushes as well as my lipsticks/glosses in it. But I am a little disappointed. It&#x27;s rather cheaply made. It doesn&#x27;t feel very sturdy, the &amp;#34;acrylic&amp;#34; is very thin and it was pretty scuffed up when I opened the box. Not at all of the quality that some of the other acrylic organizers are. But, I did only pay about 9 bucks for this, so I can&#x27;t complain too badly. Over-all, it does the job I wanted it to do, it&#x27;s just not very aesthetically pleasing.</li>
    <li> I wish the rows got deeper as they went back to fit taller lipsticks and glosses. Some of my bigger tubes get stuck in the middle lattices.</li>
    <li> wow! absolutely perfect!  These aren&#x27;t really cheaply made...for the price they are perfect.  Works great for all sizes of lipstick!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Perfect for holding all of my lipsticks and glosses. Compact enough to fit on my dresser.</li>
    <li> I saw this on line and thought it would be a great way to organize all my lipsticks, and I was right. I can now buy more lipsticks and know that I have a neat way to store them.</li>
    <li> Love this and plan on ordering more!! I have many different brands of lipsticks all have fit just fine in this organizer. Makes finding what I&#x27;m looking for so much easier and keeps my lipstick tubes nice and clean.</li>
    <li> Received item in great condition it did not have  chips or scratches on it. Holds various types of lipsticks, ie MAC, Too Faced, Lorac, etc. Perfect addition to my vanity.</li>
    <li> Great to keep lipsticks and makeup brushes that would otherwise be falling down all the time,</li>
    <li> Great display case for lipstick. Does not take up too much space. Perfect fit on any vanity and great quality.</li>
    <li> Amazing price and very good quality. Fits a variety of lipstick tubes including MAC without them being too loose and wobbly. I&#x27;ll probably be buying another for more lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Stand was broken when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Came broken&amp;#62; other than that it was good.</li>
    <li> I love this item in ordering again it&#x27;s so fricken amazing. Normally in sketchy about these products but I love it holds tons of lipSticks</li>
    <li> My product came in broke.</li>
    <li> Love it! Holds different sizes of lipstick tubes perfectly!</li>
    <li> Is good, came most early that I was expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. She&#x27;s a student &amp; when asked what she&#x27;d like for her upcoming birthday she replied that she would like this. She really likes this because now her lipsticks are organized in one place &amp; she doesn&#x27;t have to go hunting for the right color.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> Its smaller than what is seems like in the picture but its hold the the lipsticks perfectly. its so cute and does the job. would deff recommend</li>
    <li> not really stylish but gets the job done</li>
    <li> A lot of eyeliners are now sold in stick or crayon types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This acrylic holder is exactly what I wanted to hold everything (mascara in the back row).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 in case something happens.</li>
    <li> good pricing but product came with with of the corner chipped off</li>
    <li> it literally took months to arrive it had stracches on the sides and a little cracking very cheap and plastic look not clear and shiny at alll but you really shouldnt expect much for the price right lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it a five star because it was a good price for the quality... BUT it came broken in the mail and I had to hot glue the pieces together. So it needs to be packaged better for when it ships. Other than that, great product.</li>
    <li> I do like this, but not the quality that I have purchased in the past.  This is a lesser quality of Acrylic, but do not get me wrong it is still nice.  I would like to have something that would be deeper in the last (or back) row.  It works well to organize my lip and eye liners, but some liners are really tall and they do not stay as well as the short ones.  I also wanted to use it for make-up brushes, but they tend to fall out it the handle is to long.&lt;br /&gt;I just would like to find one with the depth of the slots to the bottom, but keeping the overall slant.</li>
    <li> The best I love Amazon</li>
    <li> Thanks so much!!! I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
    <li> A little small ,but a great organizer.</li>
    <li> Product was chipped and broken.</li>
    <li> Took very long to arrive... cheaper quality than I expected</li>
    <li> I received the product fairly fast, i bought another makeup holder a few weekd before this one and i was very happy with the quality of that one, it was an acrylic type material and looks really nice. I thought this product would be the same quality, but it&#x27;s not, it looks and feels cheap, it&#x27;s like a thin plastic material, not was i was expecting at all.</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love it. Very compact , tastefully made, good quality and very neat. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It took a while to arrive, but I was very happy when it did. The acrylic seems strong and it fits well different sizes of lipstick (as you can see in the picture I uploaded). I also like that it is not flat, it helps visualizing everything at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and it&#x27;s is amazing all my friends loved it and now want one I seriously recommend of you don&#x27;t have a huge massive collection of lipsticks</li>
    <li> Loved my lipstick holder 👌</li>
    <li> I bought this under the assumption it would hold finger nail polish.  It wouldn&#x27;t hold any of the polishes.</li>
    <li> Awesome organizational display.  I&#x27;ll buy more of these as I need them!</li>
    <li> I really like this lip stick holder because it holds my lipsticks kind of snug and it&#x27;s the perfect size for my vanity (not too big nor too small) buuuuut my only problem was that it took too long to come.</li>
    <li> They are in perfect condition (minor scratch in the back that you dont even see) I loved it ! And it got here within a week and half I totally recommend it !!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected! It&#x27;s great because you don&#x27;t have to put it together! :)</li>
    <li> Small but just what I needed! Fit lipsticks and lip glosses too. Some larger lipsticks I had to squeeze in there tho...</li>
    <li> I really like this lipstick organizer. It looks great and I can see where all my shades are at a glance. The price is great and I am considering buying a couple more!</li>
    <li> I loved that all my lipsticks fit perfectly. I bought 3 of these and I think I will probably buy more for my glosses. It&#x27;s very convenient to organize and see what colors you may want to wear on a daily basis. The acrylic my look a little cheap, but for the price, I&#x27;m very satisfied, they still look pretty on my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;When I first bought it, it said it will take about a month to arrive, however, it arrived earlier than expected, that was a plus plus for me.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I wanted. A couple of my lipsticks (Kat Von D brand, if you&#x27;re curious!) wouldn&#x27;t fit in the holes, but they DID fit in the other cosmetic storage box I got (the one that comes with drawers), so it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal. I think these are a must-have if you&#x27;re a lipstick fanatic like I am! You can see everything you have instead of having to dig around your make up bag or whatever!</li>
    <li> I was expecting worse because the product is so cheap, but I actually really like it. It serves it&#x27;s purpose and is quite sturdy. It also looks very night too.</li>
    <li> Mine came broken. Waste of time.</li>
    <li> Received it well before expected delivery date. It is minimalist and quality is proportional to what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;It works fairly well for me actually and ships all the way from China.</li>
    <li> Great size and fit all kinds of lipstick shapes</li>
    <li> I love anything that helps to keep me organized!</li>
    <li> I was really satisfied with this item,exactly as it looks and is described. Holds a variety of sizes/shapes lip produts, I currently have some Too Faced, NYX, Almay, Revlon, Burts Bees&#x27;s etc in it and they all fit just fine.</li>
    <li> It arrived completely broken. Not worth the time or money.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a long time and one of the holders was chipped</li>
    <li> Love it! they fit all of my lipsticks and with room to add! They also really do fit any shape and size lipstick (that I have at least)  mine range from Covergirl-Mac-NYX all sorts of lipsticks shapes and sizes.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the wait! All of my lipsticks fit perfectly!</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases that I have made to store my lipstick and other things like eyeliner and mascara and I can see all that I have at a glance</li>
    <li> Came in the mail early. And I love this thing!!!</li>
    <li> Love this,it&#x27;s sturdy and beautiful. Holds my lipstick perfectly and love how it is tiered.thinking about getting more once i run out of space.</li>
    <li> Really like it! Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Once I finally received it, I loved it. I&#x27;d recommend this to all women who have multiple lipsticksticks😀</li>
    <li> Great product but did arrive broken</li>
    <li> Unhappy because I ordered two and only received one!</li>
    <li> A great way to display and store my lipsticks and glosses :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for lipsticks, tiny so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space and arrived early. It looks exactly as the picture.</li>
    <li> Loved it!!! And it came in way earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> Fits my lipstick perfectly.. It did arrived a bit scratched on the sides but you&#x27;ll have to lean close to be able to see it.. For the price I got it, not bad...</li>
    <li> This tray fits my needs . I have numerous lipsticks ..they all fit..</li>
    <li> Came with PERFECT packaging. At first I was scared from the other reviews, but hey! It was 3 bucks</li>
    <li> I received it and it was cracked.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice sized and does the job. BUT...when i got it there was a small piece broken off of it, which is annoying but its still usable.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product for the price!&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is a bit thinner than makeup holders you&#x27;ll get at places like Target, but it didn&#x27;t make a major difference in the product.&lt;br /&gt;It also took a while to ship, but that was expected and arrived on time. Maybe don&#x27;t order if you&#x27;re needing this within a few weeks though!&lt;br /&gt;Overall great though! I will be buying another soon.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of my money and time. It was all cracked and there we&#x27;re scratch marks everywhere. Maybe I got an unlucky one but still.. Why would they even think about sending it to me in the first place when it&#x27;s all cracked. Of course, it came from China so I should&#x27;ve knew it wouldn&#x27;t be in top condition and the material wouldn&#x27;t be so sturdy, it does its job, yeah, but upset at the fact that it came in with cracks and scratches all over. Pissed.</li>
    <li> Makes organizing my lipsticks so much easier!</li>
    <li> Product came in flawless my girlfriend could not be happier  great product recommend everyone order this awesome packaging(:</li>
    <li> Shipping makes it not even worth it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. Though it took a VERY long time to come in the mail it arrived in good shape. I like that this holder is angles diagonally so it&#x27;s easy to take lipsticks in and out. Also the slots are appropriately sized for every lipstick from Milani to Mac.</li>
    <li> ALot smaller then it looks, And all of the spaces are the same depth so doesn&#x27;t hold anything but lipstick. But it&#x27;s great for that!</li>
    <li> Love it.  It&#x27;s already full so I&#x27;m going to need another one.</li>
    <li> The pkg came in a timely manner, however it was cracked from the packaging it was place in. I love the product however and is still useable.</li>
    <li> Love it!! It&#x27;s super petite and cute. Gets the job done and it was so cheap. It took forever to get here but It was worth the wait. Ill be ordering another.</li>
    <li> Nice and sturdy. Perfect for all my lip sticks.</li>
    <li> Received the lipstick holders in perfect condition and I love them! Such a good price!</li>
    <li> Arrived cracked bit it took so long to arrive i just kept it. If shipping was faster and item wasnt cracked it would be rated higher</li>
    <li> As expected small(er) than expected and hold &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; round sized lipsticks. Some of my square ones don&#x27;t fit. Good for the price tho and was packaged very secure in a box with cushion.</li>
    <li> Got here pretty quick, and works great for my Lil mascara n eyeliners too :-)</li>
    <li> Its small, fits my lipsticks, lip glosses and I even put soome of my pencils there great product</li>
    <li> smaller than I thought it would be but it still works great, holds lipsticks and almost anything that comes in a small tube, concealers, eyelash glue, samples from birchbox lol</li>
    <li> It fits my lipsticks perfectly. Definitely ordering another one</li>
    <li> Nice..I use for my Mac collection</li>
    <li> Very cheap looking and came with one slot cracked off.</li>
    <li> Love it! I don&#x27;t know how long it will last me but it&#x27;s grate for storing my lipsticks! They look so pretty and organized! I am soo buying more lol!</li>
    <li> Very Very thin and flimsy, had a smaller lipstick squares that i realized. the big ones will not fit.</li>
    <li> perfect for lipsticks.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a plastic organizer this is for you. Very light-weight and cheap. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It took its time getting to me but it&#x27;s good over all. There was 2 little cracks but nothing big so I was fine with it. It&#x27;s nice and holds the lipsticks good.</li>
    <li> Took a month to get here, and arrived broken!!! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> took forever to get. came  out flimsier than what i had expected.</li>
    <li> Love it. Wish I ordered two! Shipping seemed to take forever, but i had to remember i was ordering from over seas</li>
    <li> ordered 3 already very sturdy great product</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, tho not bulky. Holds 24 lipsticks and looks great to display them</li>
    <li> Arrived broken - underpackaged</li>
    <li> I bought this to hold my roll on oils. It is cheap but it&#x27;s ok. Serves the purpose for which I bought it. They fit perfectly and it keeps them neat and organized.</li>
    <li> These are really good. They aren&#x27;t surrounded by extra plastic. They fit the bulky square Maybelline lipsticks and the square revlon lip butters. I just ordered two more. Just wish shipping was a tad bit faster.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t hold some of my bigger lipsticks, but it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
    <li> First, I order 3 of these &amp;#34;Clear Acrylic Trapezoid Lipstick Cases ,&amp;#34;and they are great!..I realized that I needed to order more of them. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars were that some lipstick tubes, don&#x27;t fit. I may purchase some more at a later time.</li>
    <li> Received damaged n looks so cheap</li>
    <li> Great customer service product is what you pay for . My original came cracked and they offered to refund or replace . Cheap plastic but it&#x27;s to hold make up so quality doesn&#x27;t really matter unless you are an aggressive make up artist and drop things ..</li>
    <li> This makeup organizer is so cute &amp; compact! It feels plastic , but at the same time it feels like glass. But anyways you can put anything into these ! Not only lipsticks but pens , pencils or makeup ! 5 stars for how it came newly and not broken. Also it&#x27;s a bit small ! About the size of a soda can.</li>
    <li> Love it using it for my surplus lip products great way to keep organized</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a lil more bigger but it&#x27;s good fits every size lipstick and that&#x27;s what I love ! I already need another one and I have two 40 lipstick cases already. Ahh I need to slow down on my lipstick obsession lol</li>
    <li> It is great for its price. Received before anticipated! Love it already.</li>
    <li> Great! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Perfect!! Fits all my standard lipsticks. Sturdy.</li>
    <li> Has some bumpy edges; but overall it&#x27;s good quality for the price. :) got her quickly and safely.</li>
    <li> Came in on time, perfect for my bath vanity</li>
    <li> Love this holder so much,  I bought two.</li>
    <li> I use the acrylic trapezoid to hold all of my lipsticks. It fits almost all of them except for that lipsticks that have wierd shapes to them. It also holds some of my lipglosses. Came on time and looks great</li>
    <li> Product arrived as expected and works really well for my daughter&#x27;s lipbalm obsession.  Since the item came from China, it did take many weeks to receive and for some reason was sent in a manner that required a signature (since we were not home at the time of delivery, required a trip to the post office to pick up).</li>
    <li> Great for all my lipsticks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more like plastic than acrylic. It&#x27;s pretty fragile as well (it dropped from my desk-approx. 2ft and a small piece broke off. But I do still give it a 3star because it fits 99% of my lipsticks, lipgloss, and mascaras. It&#x27;s the perfect size for my table, its tiered and can&#x27;t beat the price even though it does come from china which takes about 2-3 weeks arrive.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this. It arrived in 6 days but I was disappointed because the quality sucks. It says it&#x27;s acrylic but it&#x27;s not! Just by looking at it you can tell it&#x27;s cheap plastic and eventually it will start changing color. And it&#x27;s super small!</li>
    <li> I have 5 of these I love them !!!!! Great way to store your lipstick.</li>
    <li> the only reason I gave this 4 stars is because it is thin acrylic..otherwise it works.</li>
    <li> came to me broken with a crack in it!</li>
    <li> Love these i brought 2 one for me &amp; my cousin</li>
    <li> These are great for storing lipsticks and lip glosses. They fit the various brands I own. Shipping took a bit but they came in great condition!</li>
    <li> It is smaller than what I expected. It was cracked when I took it out of the packaging. It is very fragile; breaks very easily.</li>
    <li> I believe I have bought about six of these now, &amp; I cannot say how useful, and amazing these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Even though they took a while to get here, it was definitely worth the wait. I have seen many similar products, for much much more. &amp; I absolutely refuse to have that instant gratification because I know that I can order these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits 24 lipsticks! The majority of the ones that I even see don&#x27;t even hold that much. The clear acrylic is really pretty, and it is super durable. I only know this because I dropped one after I filled it with some lipsticks, and there was not even a scratch around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these organizers to any makeup hoarder, which by the way, being a hoarder is not a bad thing when it comes to make up. :)</li>
    <li> this is really great and cheap, it fits pretty much any lipstick unless it is unusually large</li>
    <li> Perfect love these for my lipsticks</li>
    <li> This lipstick case holds just about any lipstick tube. It wipes off easily and holds just enough product. Great buy.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time! It&#x27;s small, cute and just the right size for my dresser. Not only do my lipsticks fit perfectly but so do my lipglosses. I&#x27;m so satisfied with this product I am going to order another.</li>
    <li> The Clear Transparant arylic Trapezoid Lipstick Holder is an excellent, sturdy and attractive addition to my vanity.  It fits a standard lipsticks very well.</li>
    <li> Great product, shipping faster than expected!</li>
    <li> This lipstick holder arrived in pieces. It&#x27;s very poorly made. Don&#x27;t waste your time. It didn&#x27;t even have protective wrapping or anything. Just thrown together lazily and shipped off. What a waste!!!</li>
    <li> Great organizer for my vanity. Awesome price and came a week earlier then said it would. I use it for my lipsticks, mascaras, and lip glosses.</li>
    <li> These are great for the prize! I just received them about two weeks before the actual date said to arrive. They&#x27;re great, they look just like in the picture. I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
    <li> it held all size lip sticks. love it :)</li>
    <li> love it. fits all my lipsticks perfectly.</li>
    <li> nice little organizer, good for the price. mine has a crack in the front, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Love this! I bought one because I have 68 lipsticks but I wanted to test it out before I bought more than 1. It came early! Did come with a small crack but it was internal so it was okay. Love it so much! I just bought a new one.(:</li>
    <li> Love these holders. They fit my MAC and  Lancome lipsticks. They are also able to hold drugstore brand lipsticks as well as lip glosses, and the bigger lip pencils.</li>
    <li> I love these they are small, but a great way to organize your makeup counter/ table. They make everything look so neat and a fun way to display your favorite lippies!</li>
    <li> Love it worked perfectly</li>
    <li> Mine was cracked on the back other than that i guess its alright</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This lipstick organizer is small and compact, so it doesn&#x27;t get in the way of anything on your dresser/vanity/whatever you use. I would say it fits most or all lipstick containers; only one of mine was a bit too big, but I managed to squeeze it (halfway) in. It fits nicely on top of two other acrylic organizer drawers that I have, so now my dresser is finally uncluttered! I love that it&#x27;s not bulky and obnoxious; it works really well and is made of a hard plastic.</li>
    <li> ilove this lip stick holder got here before delivery day. and im jsut so happy by it! so glad i purchased it</li>
    <li> Really amazing and now I can organize my lipsticks and won&#x27;t waste too much time in the morning just looking for them in my drawer.</li>
    <li> love these! perfect for a vanity or shelf!</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the pic!</li>
    <li> Perfect size! I&#x27;m able to put my glosses in without them being too tall and falling over. My lipstick/gloss collection keeps growing so this is my second acrylic holder. The first one I can only put lipsticks in because the holder is too shallow for the tall glosses. I will order another one when I fill up the one I just got...I do reccomend this!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Definitely holds different size lipsticks and lip glosses! Can hold them placed up or down. Really happy with this purchase...I think I need two!</li>
    <li> Perfect Just as I expected small cute and compact if u looking for something huge this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. It looks great and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this item, especially for a reasonable price. The shipping comes from Hong Kong, so it takes a while to receive the product; I think about a month. When it finally got here, it was broken. Understanding that sometimes these things happen, I contacted the seller to see if I could get a replacement. They sent me another one (which I had to wait another month for) and that one was broken as well. I was so frustrated that I had to wait 2 months for a product and it never ended up being usable. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time with this seller and buy elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Overall I am satisfied with this product. However, it does not hold a lot of lipsticks. My Tom Ford lipsticks do not fit well, I have to jam it in the little square. My YSL lipgloss also does not fit all the way in. Chanel, and Mac, Sephora do fit very well though.</li>
    <li> nice kep lip stick nice and neat</li>
    <li> It fits every with any lipstick!</li>
    <li> This acrylic cosmetic holder is excellent for lipsticks, mascara, eye liners, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing, if you decide to put your eyeliner in 1 section, put several of them in. The space given will be too big for just 1 eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;Quality is excellent and very crystal clear!</li>
    <li> this looks pretty and does the job, but some of the slots came broken. the plastic is cheap and flimsy. OK for the price. it would be better if it came in bubble wrap instead of the thin cardboard</li>
    <li> All of my lipsticks,no matter the size fit! should have brought two. I would order again.</li>
    <li> This is perfect. It fits perfectly on my bathroom sink and holds all of my lipstick and lip gloss. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on my sink and makes my sink look pretty and spacious.</li>
    <li> Nice, but mine arrived broken :-(</li>
    <li> Love this little organizer</li>
    <li> I had bought 2. One was completely broken to pieces and the other was fine. I so use both. I just convinced myself that the broken one was giving my makeup collection an&amp;#34;edge.&amp;#34; i say buy at your own risk. You could get a dud or a good win. 50/50 chance. Why not try?</li>
    <li> Awesome for all the make up lovers out there with a ton of lip sticks and no where to put them easy to organize them all and pick the ones you need. Looks really cool too on a vanity with your make up collection :)</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I pictured in my mind, but I like it a lot! It&#x27;s a cute way to organize your lipsticks. The only problem was that it was a little broken /: but it does its job 😊</li>
    <li> like I said I was happy to get it but when I opened the box that&#x27;s when I saw the broken edges, other than that it does what it is suppose to do...hold lipsticks</li>
    <li> Looks great and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Small but handy. Worth it. Good buy</li>
    <li> As seen in picture.. Good buy..</li>
    <li> Will be ordering more. Love these.</li>
    <li> I ended up giving this away, the slots were not big enough to hold the items I was trying to put in there.</li>
    <li> I loved this! Small cute and very affordable! Looking forward to purchasing more later on. 😊</li>
    <li> Good deal nice size .</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Simple lipstick holder.</li>
    <li> Loved this!! I have a lot of lipsticks and this makes it easy to keep them organized and all my lipstick sizes fit, for 24 spaces you can&#x27;t beat the price!! Yes it takes a &amp;#34;bit&amp;#34; long, but I got mine shipped a couple of hours after placing my order AND received before the &amp;#34;expected date&amp;#34; Couldn&#x27;t be happier I wish I would have purchased 2! I will be buying another, but I don&#x27;t want to wait haha. BUT I WILL!</li>
    <li> Love how compact it is and fits most of my lipsticks, doesn&#x27;t fit 2 of them though that were a little wider :/ but that&#x27;s my only complaint (: if you have any wider lipsticks they won&#x27;t fit but my Mac, naked, nyx and Loreal lipsticks fit perfectly. I love organization!</li>
    <li> Good organizer for lipsticks! The organizer looks a lil cloudy though. Not the fanciest organizer but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 first one as perfect second was was broken up when I received it</li>
    <li> OMG, I may say this product is so good I love makeup and this is a great organizer, as a makeup lover I do not wear to much lipsticks but I still love to keep my makeup organize , fast shipping too ❤️👏🏼</li>
    <li> Loved it, wasnt disappointed.</li>
    <li> Being a lippy addict and organization maniac having my lip products in display with this organizer is a very pleasant feel.&lt;br /&gt;I need to get myself another one of this soon to get my collection completely neat and put together</li>
    <li> Great quality fast delivery holds all my sister lip stick sturdy</li>
    <li> These Comments Making It Seem Like Its Tiny. Its Not Small Nor Big. Its Big Enough To Hold Ya Lipsticks N Not Be In The Way. I Like It A lot. Does The Job.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price. It&#x27;s great for lipsticks. Although it says it can work for other things it will not work for brushes or anything that&#x27;s longer than a lipstick. the bottom of this holder is covered. If you put mascara, brushes, liners they will fall or lay sideways. Must be used for lipsticks. it is compact. It look a little longer than expected to arrive but was still within the shipping dates.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but I think its just ok. It doesn&#x27;t fit larger lipsticks, only medium sized ones, and is difficult to organize. Also, it is much smaller in real life than you would picture. If you are looking for something that isn&#x27;t spectacular but is just so-so, then this might work for you. But it isn&#x27;t that wonderful, so you might want to just keep looking.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this item. It came with a small cracking,  but it still  functions well.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery smaller then what it looks like in the picture but it&#x27;s super cute and lipsticks fit perfectly</li>
    <li> Wife uses this to organize her makeup. She plans on getting more of these as her &amp;#34;collection grows&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Really great product not too big and not to small just the right size to not take up too much room.</li>
    <li> good product. It fits all my lipsticks and lip glosses. Will need to order it one more. Good add on product worth the money.</li>
    <li> The first come came broken. I had to send pictures to get a new one. This second time it came with extra padding.</li>
    <li> Nice, did its job and didn&#x27;t take up much space. Delivery was much sooner than originally estimated.</li>
    <li> came broken with a slight crack and chip on the right side but if it wasn&#x27;t broken it would be fantastic</li>
    <li> These came a few weeks before I expected them to. I was thinking 6-8 weeks since they were coming from China. They are perfect for storing my lipsticks/glosses and sample sizes of shadow primers, eye liners, etc. Well worth the wait and I&#x27;ll be purchasing many more of these.</li>
    <li> Very good item with fast shipping.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect. You can&#x27;t really go wrong here unless it comes to you cracked, and it didn&#x27;t:) I ended up having less lipstick than i thought i did, which is good because since it holds 24, i will always have room if i decide to buy more:)</li>
    <li> This item came in perfect condition and was packaged quite nicely. Shipping took a while, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain. Most of my lipsticks fit in the holder, with the exception of my Maybelline lipsticks. I will definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> Great for holding all my MAC lipsticks</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about it. It does what it is supposed to do. I really like it. It would have received 5 stars if it were a bit more sturdy. I feel if it drops, it&#x27;s done. Other than that it&#x27;s perfect and with an unbeatable price tag.</li>
    <li> Horrible condition. I would rate it a half star if that was an option. Scratches everywhere and feels like it&#x27;s going to break any minute.</li>
    <li> Many small and decent sizes of pieces of acrylic fell off from the product when I opened the package. The product was not packaged properly even though the material of the organizer is quite fragile. I am going to use them since it seems like they can stand by itself and they were cheap (I have not used them yet but I am too lazy to return the organizers), but I won&#x27;t make future purchase or recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 3 start because, if is your first time getting lipstick holders they are OK, and it is exactly what you are paying for. But it has a cheap plastic material it did not fell like acrylic at all, and I bought two and both of them came with cracks in the front. But it fits all of different size of lipstick and is not a bad product if is your beginning.</li>
    <li> Review from my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits all lipsticks i have (MAC, REVLON, MAYBELLENE, COLORBAR and other lipgloss and lipbalms). Its cute and worth buying.</li>
    <li> I love the item but mine came in chipped. I would return but it&#x27;s too much of a hassle I&#x27;m just keeping it as is. I wish they would have wrapped it up a little better</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for these were really cheap. They were very thin and one broke super easy.</li>
    <li> Fits most of my lipsticks (Nars, MAC, MUFE) but couldn&#x27;t fit my Buxom gloss/lipsticks and my Givenchy lipstick.  Oh well, still works as intended, shipped fast and mine arrived unscathed.</li>
    <li> Took about 21 days to arrive, it  still arrived sooner than expected since it was coming from China. I ordered 4 and 1 had a very small crack in the back of the container, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the functionality. Very Happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> This thing is much smaller than I expected but its friggen perfect for perfume travalos, decants and samples. If you have lots of fragrances that you decant into travel size atomizers or lots of perfume samples this thing is perfffffect for that. I have lots of frags so I ordered three more to organize my stuff. My travel size atomizers are 5 and 6ml and they fit.</li>
    <li> Fit all my lipsticks PERFECTLY. In love.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than anticipated; however it was broken in a few places. It&#x27;s the correct item and has slightly thinner acrylic than what I had in mind (my acrylic drawers have thicker acrylic), but it was broken so I can&#x27;t use it yet.</li>
    <li> This is cute and small perfect if you don&#x27;t want something taking up a lot of space it isn&#x27;t hard acrylic but you get what you pay for so I don&#x27;t see why others are complaining about this product it does the job I would recommend  it</li>
    <li> The shipping took forever. Also I received it damaged. Lucky the crack is on the corner and shouldn&#x27;t require me to return it. Last, its so much smaller than the picture leads you to believe.</li>
    <li> It is an okay organizer but this feels more like plastic than acrylic to me. The quality is not as good as some others I&#x27;ve purchased for around the same price.</li>
    <li> Love love my lipstick organizer, definitely worth the price . The packaging was secured in a box , good thing since I read reviews on how some people received it broken. I was hoping mines wouldn&#x27;t break . Glad they placed it in a box . Must buy</li>
    <li> It came cracked ń broke</li>
    <li> Took a month to arrive but it arrived unharmed and perfect! To save space I adhered it to my wall using 3M hook strips!</li>
    <li> Great for the price!!</li>
    <li> Price was good, but I ordered two and both came in with pieces broke.</li>
    <li> Great sturdy product! In love!</li>
    <li> Great price. Poor packaging. One corner was chip and there was a crack because of the poor packaging.</li>
    <li> Looooove this! Beautiful Nice and simple display for your lipsticks. Definitely ordering another one!</li>
    <li> Love it simply perfect</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Came in less than 2 weeks. Fits most of my lipsticks perfectly. Already ordered another one.</li>
    <li> Really liked the case. It fits all my lipsticks perfectly. Arrived in good condition and was well packaged. I had to wait for sometime but after seeing the product quality, I feel it was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Small broken corner overall a must have! Lipsticks and / or lip glosses fit perfectly😃</li>
    <li> Every section varies a tad bit with size so a lipstick that fits in one of the holes may not fit in another but overall for the price this helps me organize my lipsticks pretty well</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish organizer, I buy the nail art polishes as Julep and those sure fit perfectly and do not fall as usual. It is a small size, so if you were looking for a big size is not for you. I personally love it and came in perfect conditions.</li>
    <li> I like this item just wish it was larger.</li>
    <li> Was a bit smaller than I expected it to be, but I am still very pleased with it. Great storage for make up brushes, lipsticks/ glosses, eye liners, etc.</li>
    <li> I have repurchased this many times! It is an awesome product especially for the price point! The only thing I do have to say is that the compartments are not all the same as each other. Also some lip sticks might not fit in it. BUT I STILL LOVE it and have purchased many of them!</li>
    <li> I order two more and i will be order from them again</li>
    <li> Very sturdy  will repurchase</li>
    <li> Loved it!!!! It came perfect and fits my lipsticks perfect!!!</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time but mine came broken when. But i still like it</li>
    <li> So happy with the product! Great price and came in perfect condition. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. Fits my lipsticks perfectly &amp; makes for a pretty display.  It&#x27;s nice &amp; solid too despite the cheap price point.</li>
    <li> Not what I expect it waited too long and for it to be broken</li>
    <li> Too small to put anything in.</li>
    <li> Really simple lipstick holder that does the job I needed it to. This is not thick acrylic like you would get at Bed Bath and Beyond but I didn&#x27;t need that. The slots fit basic lipstick tubes but some specialty ones (think Kat Von D Studded) don&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> It was broken when I received it</li>
    <li> It arrived days before the promised date...all my Mary Kay lipsticks and lip glosses fit perfectly! (Ordered two more a few days after, still waiting on them) :-)</li>
    <li> great addition to My vanity!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my lipsticks!</li>
    <li> Really nice I thought it was expensive but your price was great! Great seller!</li>
    <li> Gift for my sister and she loved it! Now she has her brushes &amp; other stuff organized....</li>
    <li> Shipping took forever .Cheap.</li>
    <li> Lipstick holder? Not for me, e-liquid flavor holder. I have 4 of these all filled with different flavors. Most 10ml or less bottles will fit in the holes. I know Tasty Puff 10 ml bottles will not unless they have changed their bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one for tanks and drippers along with batteries, drip tips and ego style batteries until I bought a different organizer for those goodies and filled the now empty holes with more flavors from the big box on the floor. I disliked looking through multiple baggies of flavors in the box for the few I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Some people organize by flavor types. I did it by flavor brands so they are basically the same height in each holder. Helps when stacking. When I make my DIY vaping workstation then I will line them up end to end. That will be nicer looking too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you want to use them for, it is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Great idea for keeping your lipsticks visible on your countertop or dressing table.</li>
    <li> I have to say: it is too poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works and cheap. But I regret to buy it.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price! My Mac and Nars lipsticks fit perfectly. Definitely recommend. Only downside is that it takes a while to be delivered, BUT still worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this because of the price and makes my vanity look clean. I don&#x27;t like how it is shipped/packaged, the is always a piece broke off or cracked. Is not a big one just some minor cosmetic issues. Is not am issue on all of them I would say 1/3 of the time, other than that I like it</li>
    <li> Exactly what is described. Faster shipping than expected. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have many, many lipsticks (even at work) and these provide an excellent way to organize your lippies. Love these, super reasonable price, and lat forever.</li>
    <li> this simple acrylic lipstick holder has made it so easy for me to align them according to color.  it makes it quite easy in the morning just to pick up that exact lipstickI want to wear for the day.</li>
    <li> Just received my Acrylic Lipstick holder and I am very pleased.  It fits all my lipsticks and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. Came a lot sooner than I thought which is awesome.  Most definitely will purchase a few more</li>
    <li> This thing is trash it came cracked and felt like very cheap plastic, i didnt think i could go wrong with a lipstick holder but i stand corrected</li>
    <li> Awesome this is my 5th one I&#x27;ve bought</li>
    <li> Works great! Fits my lipsticks/glosses/stains perfectly.</li>
    <li> Can not beat the price!  I&#x27;ve got MAC, Urban Decay, Nars, and drugstore lip products in there, the only thing that didn&#x27;t fit is some random matte lip gloss/stain thing, but I&#x27;ve got it semi-wedged in the back and it&#x27;s fine.  It is a thinner plastic than other items I&#x27;ve seen out there, but it&#x27;s also less expensive.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have any issues with it getting broken sitting on my vanity.  I especially liked the tiered slots which makes it easier to see everything in there.</li>
    <li> Love the price and the product.</li>
