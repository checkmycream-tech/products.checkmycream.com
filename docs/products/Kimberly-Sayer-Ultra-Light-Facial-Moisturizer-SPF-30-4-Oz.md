      <li>As I have very sensitive skin, this product was the best bet for me.</li>

      <li>Algae is wonderful as an anti-aging ingredient, but if people with sensitive, acne prone skin use it, they&#x27;re bound for a breakout.</li>
      <li>me, this was a case of it being too good to be true.  </li>

      <li>However, after a week or so of using it, it made me break out even more.  </li>
      <li>top of that, every morning I have used the moisturizer I&#x27;ve had an acne and blackhead breakout by evening.  </li>
      <li>I love how it feels on my face.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are truly all-natural, compared with many high-priced moisturizers.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if the sunscreen works well yet</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think that all SPF products would be healthy because they are suppose to prevent skin cancer</li>
      <li>With so many of its ingredients being oils, it shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with sunscreens because most of the time, they have pore clogging ingredients that cause me to break out.</li>
      <li>I purchased this sunscreen/moisturizer in hopes of it finally being the perfect product to use for sun protection.</li>
      <li>I am okay with</li>
      <li>and it does not sit on the skin, I do not know if it makes you feel better.</li>
      <li>Love the SPF and it is truly a lightweight face cream.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product has been absolutely amazing! It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, does a great job of moisturizing my skin, has no hidden chemicals, and my first bottle has lasted me 7 months!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a non-chemical SPF combined with face moisturizer for a long time. I live in sunny southern California. This product is great for those with sensitive skin or those allergic to chemical based sunscreens. Most companies only have face moisturizer w/ SPF that contains chemical suncreen but I am allergic to those chemical ingredients which causes me to have a face rash. The Kimberly Sayer moisturizer plus SPF is a great find. It doesn&#x27;t contain any chemical suncreen ingredients, only physical blockers and I don&#x27;t need to put on separate moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it every day since I got it. My skin is naturally oily and it has not caused any pimples and it keeps my skin feeling less oily. Usually non-chemical sunblocks make your face white because of the titanium dioxide (I&#x27;ve tried the neutrogena sensitive skin sunblock and it is very hard to blend in, still see whitish color on face) but the Kimberly Sayer product goes on smoothly without any whitish color. You get a huge size bottle and only need to use a little bit to get full face coverage so it is definitely worth the money. I will definitely buy again, please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product. I will also look into other products made by Kimberly Sayer because I like this product so much. I&#x27;ve tried Juice Beauty&#x27;s Mineral Moisturizer with SPF which also has non-chemical sunblock but found it to be more oily on my skin, although it was good in that it didn&#x27;t cause whitish tinge either, but it was more expensive for the number of ounces that you got.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. It absorbs easily, as opposed to many other non-chemical sunscreens, isn&#x27;t greasy, and smells nice. I only wish it came in a mini size so I could travel with it.</li>
    <li> Something is off here. I LOVE this product and have been using it for years. It&#x27;s easily the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found for my face and I&#x27;ll cry if it&#x27;s ever discontinued. HOWEVER, whoever is selling it from this site is either selling a knock-off or putting it in a cheap pump bottle with a cheap slap-on label. I don&#x27;t think its the same product. BUYER BEWARE. There are other sites you can find it where it&#x27;s authentic. Even if you pay full price plus shipping, it&#x27;s a smoking deal compared to other sunscreens of this quality. A bottle lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for natural moisturizers with SPF and liked Juice Beauty and Juice Organics. A friend recommended Kimberly Sayer and I love using it and cannot go a single day without using it. I love the light texture and very mild lemon scent, and it is so effective in protecting my skin and keeping it very soft. I will be looking into the other products in the line because this moisturizer works so well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Kimberly Sayer&#x27;s products for years.  I&#x27;m a makeup artist &amp; have extremely sensitive skin.  Her products are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that work well &amp; don&#x27;t aggravate my rosacea.  This moisturizer feels great going on but really sinks in &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Hard to spread because it&#x27;s like water &amp; soaks in immediately. Also, I think the lemon was a little too intense for my sensitive skin &amp; it made me break out.</li>
    <li> just the perfect daily lotion I&#x27;m looking for my combination skin, worth the money, not oil ,not dry, just moist</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  It has a fresh, light scent and goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  I especially love that it has SPF 25 and that it is organic.  A great product for a great price.  I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> This is the only SPF facial moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy, or make me break out. It&#x27;s very light and airy, the texture is not thick at all, and almost feels like it doesn&#x27;t quite absorb into your pores. This is turning out to be a good thing - maybe less likely to clog pores and trap bacteria in - my face feels very healthy and stays clear when I use it. At first I thought that might make it less effective as a sunscreen, but it definitely ended  up protecting my face from sunburn. This stuff also smells like fresh lemon zest whipped cream, but not too overpowering, which is very refreshing!  Kimberly Sayer products don&#x27;t have chemical agents that could be toxic to your skin, which is a huge relief. Great alternative to the harmful ingredients found in most drugstore cosmetics and skin care products.  I highly recommend this product! my search for the perfect sunscreen/lotion combo is over, I will buy this as long as the product is available, which I hope is forever! Can&#x27;t recommend it enough. Every time I read other reviews complaining about how hard it is to find the perfect SPF cream, I want to get the word out about this. I officially sound like an infomercial...</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about a year or so now. It lasts if you use it sparingly, I used to use it everyday. But I began using it mainly on hot days and in the summer time because it makes your face a bit sticky from the spf. I enjoy the natural organic ingredients, I have not seen it benefit my skin when I get occasional acne, but I have yet to see a moisturizer that works well and is organic. I would like to look around for cheaper spf moisturizers for acne prone skin that are organic, but for now, I enjoy using this :)</li>
    <li> The only product I feel comfortable using (and I am very picky when it comes to choosing when it comes to products for my family and myself.). I LOVE this stuff and will order again! Very pleased.  Not greasy at all :)</li>
    <li> This is simply the best moisturizer I have ever found, and I hope Kimberly Sayer never stops making it.  Light, quick to absorb, with a subtle citrus scent, this moisturizer does double-duty as a 25 SPF sunscreen.  I find it&#x27;s even a little too light for the dry cold winters in NYC, so I use it on top of a natural oil like argan oil.  The ingredients are truly all-natural, compared with many high-priced moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a million moisturizers, but could never find one moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Not only is this incredibly moisturizing, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy, its got SPF 25, it&#x27;s good for acne-prone skin, and you only need a couple drops at a time, so it lasts a good 6 months!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a chemical-free, matte, easily-absorbed, non-greasy sunscreen for my face and I found it! It absorbs very quickly and it not nearly so shiny as other face moisturizers with sunscreen. It also doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts which I have to watch for as well. Plus, it comes in a giant bottle that will last a looong time! The only negative for me (and it&#x27;s incredibly minor), is I think the scent is a little strong, but I don&#x27;t smell it any more after I&#x27;m done applying it.</li>
    <li> This is great. Does not make me breakout and it is super moisturizing without making me oily.</li>
    <li> Great lightweight sunscreen for people who don&#x27;t spend much time out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for oily/acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has never broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size of product for the price you pay for it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to go towards a more organic option for my face and this works like a charm. Best daytime facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. The smell is so amazing and it even leaves my hands soft, unlike other stuff I&#x27;ve used on my face prior like Aveeno Simply Radiant and Oil of Olay which did nothing for me. I use this in the morning under makeup. After I wash my face in the evening, I put on some Christina Moss Naturals Organic moisturizer. Right before bed, I add a drop of organic jojoba oil. Even in peak winter months my face is nice and supple without any patchy dry spots on my cheeks from the cold wind. I also have an mild oily t-zone and this doesn&#x27;t add to the existing &amp;#34;oil refinery&amp;#34; on my face. All in all this AM/PM combo for my face is working out quite nicely.</li>
    <li> I like the type of sunscreen this moisturizer has but found it made me look a bit pale and although I liked how it felt going on, overall I don&#x27;t think it worked as a moisturizer for me. There&#x27;s a lot of it though. I wish it had a slight tint. I use NeoCutis&#x27; tinted moisturizer with sunscreen and really like it but wanted something that was a little more plant/nature based. And the NeoCutis is waaaaay more expensive.</li>
    <li> I have oily and acne-prone skin; this moisturizer works perfectly for me. It&#x27;s lightweight with a very pleasant lemon smell. I also love the fact that it contains physical sunscreen but doesn&#x27;t cause any white cast on my face as some other non-chemical moisturizer or sunscreen would. The bottle also lasts forever. I will definitely try out other products from this brand because I cannot be more satisfied with a moisturizer than I am with this one.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels on my face. It does not make it greasy and my face is less greasy at the end of the day than if I wear other moisturizers for acne prone skin. I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if the sunscreen works well yet but I would still buy it again anyway. The smell of lemon is strong right when you put it on, but it fades fast. The bottle does sometimes swirts out of my fingers across the room, so if I were to change something it would be the bottle. Also the top doesn&#x27;t stay on well, but it just sits on my dresser so it&#x27;s fine for me. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> The texture is very light; it smells light, clean and cytrusy; the container is great and there is never any lotion left over; and it is environmentally-conscious.</li>
    <li> Very light and refreshing-and ALL NATURAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That combination is very rare.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only suggestion for improvement would be packaging; it&#x27;s not very eco-friendly as it is now, but that&#x27;s a minor complaint.</li>
    <li> Light moisturizer -- great for summer, especially it is SPF30. This bottle will last me a long time since I only need one pump per application and I only need it in the morning before I go out.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive, oily and prone for break out. This product is really light, smells fresh, and seems do the job. Plus, my skin is very stable and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing it recommended in a magazine.  I live in sunny California, have very light skin, and work outside so I need a high SPF cream to use everyday.  I was drawn to this because it uses organic ingredients, has no parabens and uses titanium and zinc oxide for the sunblock protection.  I&#x27;m also acne prone.  My husband and I use this every morning and a bottle lasts us @ 4 months.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and absorbs quickly so I can apply makeup soon afterward.  Best cream for the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product so much, it smells wonderful and glides smoothly on, and also sinks into skin quickly. It moisturizers while it protects but is not greasy. Co-workers commented my skin was glowing and lovely. I have *very* sensitive skin and almost everything breaks me out, this product did as well, so although I am sad I&#x27;m sure it will work for most people who aren&#x27;t crazy acne-prone like myself.</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a sunscreen for over a year. I am militant about sunscreen and have been for years. When I became educated on the effects some of the chemicals can have long-term on your skin and liver in many normal sunscreens, I immediately began a &amp;#34;quest&amp;#34; for the best natural sunscreen out there. I tried a couple different ones before landing with this one. I use it daily and was happy with the scent (so fresh!) and the feeling of it on my skin (it smooths on easily and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily, sticky, or make it turn a ghostly shade of white). But it wasn&#x27;t until today that I realized that it really works! I knew that it was better than nothing, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how long it lasted or how powerful it was because anytime I go to the beach or am in the sun for hours with direct exposure to the sun, I use something more heavy-duty. Today I found myself unexpectedly on an outing for 3 hours with direct sun exposure. I didn&#x27;t have sunscreen on my arms and they got a pretty bad sunburn. I was sure my nose and cheeks would be burned after so long in the sun, but I&#x27;m happy to say they don&#x27;t even have the slightest burn! If I wasn&#x27;t a believer before, I certainly am now!</li>
    <li> My sister bought this product for herself and absolutely loved the feel of it. This product was none like I&#x27;ve tried before especially because of my dry skin. As I have very sensitive skin, this product was the best bet for me. One of the factors that I loved is how the ingredients are all organic, so I have nothing to worry about, especially the side-effects which comes with the other Moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I have very finicky skin, and this product is just lovely. It moisturizes and protects while feeling and smelling amazing. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So the reason I am giving this only one star is because once I received my Kimberly Sayer Moisterizer, 1/4 of it was gone from the bottle. Also, the bottle on the picture is not the same one I received. I am very disappointed with this order, for spending 33 dollars on one product. The order should have been right.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Very light and refreshing. Have used it under foundation without spf and alone.</li>
    <li> Reading other reviews, I had high hopes for this lotion. I LOVE the smell of it, pleasant and not too overpowering (but then I also like lemons a lot). It goes on light, and is not greasy at all. I do have to use more than recommended, or I cannot get full coverage. I would especially recommend using more if using it as your only sunscreen. I love it as a lotion, but had to give it a 3* as it causes me to break out. I&#x27;ve relegated it as a lotion for use on my arms and legs only, which it is too light for, but I wanted to get my use out of the bottle (and as I said, the smell is a plus). I should note, I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to both smells and chemicals and I did not have any problems with either using this lotion. If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I break out when using it, I would give it a 5.</li>
    <li> I found this on EWG&#x27;s skin deep where it&#x27;s rated as one of the best, stable and protective facial SPFs. I was looking for something like this for a long time. I wanted it to be as natural as possible, moisturize, have a great protection from UVA/UVB rays and be as lightweight as possible. And here it is! The best thing ever! I have a combo/oily skin. Every day I used to use moisturizer followed by SPF minimum 30. The SPF face creams usually leave a whitish film on the skin and/or too greasy. This one is all in one, won&#x27;t leave any greasy residue, will protect and moisturize.</li>
    <li> Bottle looks used, and was opened.Also disappointed with the size as well. I hope this is original packaging since the plastic label looks a little wrinkled on.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  One of the only ones I&#x27;ve ever found that I like for my pale, sensitive, combination, extremely acne prone skin. Goes great under makeup and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!!! I have very oily skin and yet I find it&#x27;s very light on my face. I love the lemon scent and this is the first SPF moisturizer that  doesn&#x27;t break me out. Shipping was also fast</li>
    <li> I am using this product for two weeks now, and it is a great sunscreen. I do not think is would be moisturizing enough if you have dry skin but for my combination skin it is enough even in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say that this product left their skin shiny but I did not have that problem. Many chemical sunscreens left my face shiny in the past. It is a relief to find a natural sunscreen that is moisturizing and does not left my face shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is lemon oil in it which makes some people uncomfortable. Someone send an email about it to the company (I saw it in a blog but i cannot remember which one) and they said that amount of lemon oil in the product is little, it is used to help blemishes and it does not sit on the skin, I do not know if it makes you feel better. I am okay with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells really nice!! .</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!! It goes on really smooth, NOT cakey like some facial SPF products do. Most of all it&#x27;s natural and does not have all those typical carcinogenic chemicals that most SPF products do. I spend a lot of time researching products and try to find the cleanest line as well as one that is practical--meaning it isn&#x27;t like mud to put on your face and then makes you look like a ghost after applying it. You&#x27;d think that all SPF products would be healthy because they are suppose to prevent skin cancer but yet the majority of them are loaded with the very things that can make us sick, have allergic reactions to, and have those terrible life threatening chemicals in them. Did you know that 60% of creams/lotions absorb in our body-blood stream?  Well Kimberly Sayer Ultra Light Facial Moisturizer is one of the more healthier products for our skin. It has a nice light citrus smell and feels good on the skin. If you want a product that is SPF chemically healthy for you and goes on smooth like silk, then Kimberly Sayer is the one you DEFINITELY want to buy!!! Thank you for making this AMAZING product!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome Product, huge amount, thus great price. Does what it claims to do. And read instructions first before using. Don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t  use a large amount. Only a little for it to be effective (not clog pores etc). Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. The one I bought last year had a slight citris scent but this time its different so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the real product. I did contact the Kimberly Slayer website to ask and I was told, &amp;#34;Sometimes age of plants affects scent and texture.&amp;#34; They also said this Amazon seller/company is legitimate so the product is real. The lotion isn&#x27;t thick and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either which I like.  I get cystic acne on my chin and this doesn&#x27;t break me out like other products.</li>
    <li> Took some getting used to.  It&#x27;s nice for an spf moisturizer, but I can&#x27;t use it all the time.  My skin feels a little clogged if I do.  In general I do like it and it is all natural and smells great.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! It is so soft and light on your skin and your skin doesn&#x27;t look white which is common with other physical sunblocks. So it has the whole advantages of a chemical sunblock, but with natural ingredients and almost no side effects! I am glad that my son introduced it to me.</li>
    <li> This is the first SPF that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction on my face. I&#x27;ve tried loads of top-end brands and dermatologist-recommended but this is the only one that suits. lightweight and nice fresh lemon scent.. two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t apply enough but I used this twice a day and it did not provide enough coverage for me.  I was in and out of the sun (vacation in Europe, so I was walking around a lot outside) but I re applied after lunch every day and still got burnt.  I also wore a hate every time I was out in the sun.  Maybe a good sunscreen for persons who are not outside a lot.  I thought it would give me more protection.  I tried applying more but then it made my face really greasy.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it. The product works great for my skin.</li>
    <li> light weight sunscreen that does its job and has wonderful ingredients. i think i will forever buy :)</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, but it totally made my face breakout and feel greasy. My forehead became completed covered in bumps until I figured out this was the cause and stopped using it. Once I switched to a different moisturizer with SPF, my face cleared up. I am thinking that it may be the titanium dioxide that I had a reaction to. I also got burned on my face while using this, which made it useless as far as sun protection goes.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! I like that it is lightweight, works well under my makeup, has SPF and has all natural ingredients.  A little goes along way!</li>
    <li> I use this all over - face, arms, neck, shoulders -  any place I want to have some backup sun protection.  It doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores and is great under foundation.  So glad I found this product, ready to order another container!</li>
    <li> Contrary to the reviews I read on Amazon and other sites prior to buying this product, the moisturizer is not mattifying in the least.  I&#x27;ve encountered sunscreens and moisturizers that leave my face with more of a shine, but my skin was clearly much oilier after applying than before.  With so many of its ingredients being oils, it shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise.  I shouldn&#x27;t have believed the claims that the oils would absorb, leaving a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, every morning I have used the moisturizer I&#x27;ve had an acne and blackhead breakout by evening.  I had had my acne more-or-less under control using Olay Total Effects moisturizer, and even my Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture was better--and that still makes my skin slightly redden!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor aspects in favor of the product: it feels somewhat light and the smell is not overwhelming.  I&#x27;d describe it&#x27;s scent as &#x27;lemon PEZ.&#x27;  It doesn&#x27;t leave skin looking chalky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this was a case of it being too good to be true.  I would have loved a safe moisturizer with plenty of antioxidants and collagen-promoters that mattified and had a relatively high SPF with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide sunblocks.  That didn&#x27;t make my face look like a diseased oil slick.  Unfortunately, this product most definitely is not that moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Dried out my face.  I was planning to use sunscreen daily on a doctor&#x27;s recommendation - this one was very highly rated by EWG and supposed to moisturize in addition to block the sun.  But it&#x27;s probably not for people with my skin type (quite dry, never much acne even when I was a teenager).  It gave me dry patches on my nose and cheeks that were starting to be uncomfortable. I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> excellent! thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. Does not make me break out. Feels very light. Love the 30 SPF. Plus a nice lemony scent that&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>
    <li> It is the third one I have used, it is light, mild, not greasy, has lovely smell smell, I love it!</li>
    <li> Works alright. Applies on easily and is not greasy.  There is a light layer at first but gets absorbed quickly with no visible areas.  It has a slight metallic smell that may be from the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. Got it for free at my sugaring spa with promotion and it lasted me months. Love the SPF and it is truly a lightweight face cream. Hydrates and goes on perfectly under foundations. Just ran out so repurchased.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural spf facial moisturizer and this was my next one to try.  I had high hopes for it after reading some of the good reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  It is lightweight, the smell is nice, and it absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving a white residue.  However, after a week or so of using it, it made me break out even more.  My skin is sensitive and this really made it worse.  If it doesn&#x27;t bother your skin, it seems like a great one to try and the bottle is huge and will last a long time.  I wish it worked for me!</li>
    <li> The pump broke after just a few days of use, so now I have to open the whole thing every time I use it. I&#x27;m not really sure I&#x27;m getting any sun protection from it; seems like I still get red after being out in the sun--not usually the case with other 25-30 SPF products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of matte facial lotions and this one is by far the best. It moisturizes very well considering you get the matte, no shine on your face. It comes in a large container that lasts a long time (probably 5-6 months, which is fine for the relative high price). The SPF of 30 is more than enough for daily use. The lemony smell is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Retin A every other day so my face is dry and scaly. This lotion does enough to moisturize my dry skin. However, once and a while my skin will have dry flakes so keep that in mind. I don&#x27;t think this lotion is strong enough for the cold, windy Winters. But for Spring and Summer it is absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> Very light and the smell is nice.</li>
    <li> great product, only sunscreen/mositurizer that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> I broke out as first time I used it ! Very disappointed  I was thinking I finally found right moisturizer for my acne prone skin !</li>
    <li> Nice smelling moisturizer, but still feel a burning sensation in the hot weather despite the Spf30!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. It is light and non-greasy, has a pleasant lemon fragrance, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the real Kimberly Sayer Ultra Light Facial Moisturizer. I would rate that an easy 5 stars. No question. Problem is that I received what appears and smells and feels to be a knock-off. Bottle was a standard generic pump dispenser with a narrowly fitting label - which was affixed haphazardly. Not legit. Wish I&#x27;d read the reviews before placing order - just now read that I am not the only one to receive a faux product. Returning immediately. Until today, the original KS ultra light, was a trusted product from a trusted site. Thumbs down</li>
    <li> Nice product. Great alone or under makeup!!  Dont care too much for the smell. my face smells like lemon drops and ginger snaps; not what I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, not greasy when you put it on or after. It&#x27;s perfect!! You won&#x27;t regret it. It&#x27;s great for normal to combination skin.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a lightweight moisturizer with SPF.  I find that most with SPF are very thick and you have to really rub it into your skin. This is extremely lightweight and it only takes a few drops. It blends easily into my skin and I do not have to wait a long time for it to dry.  Most importantly, it is made with non-toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> The only moisturizer with &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients that does not make me look chalky and does not break the bank! This bottle is huge and will last forever. Pleasant light citrus smell is a bonus, too!</li>
    <li> Love this suff. Great price for the amount and high quality ingredients. It doesn&#x27;t quite control the oil or shine though, but I&#x27;m sure it works much better than any other spf cream product out there for an oily combination complexion like mine because I&#x27;ve tried a bunch. I love the fresh lemon smell too, but if you&#x27;re not a lemon lover, beware.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time &amp; packaging was great - so well packed so it didn&#x27;t rattle when I shook the box. It has only natural sunscreens and the liquid-y texture that I was looking for, but it doesn&#x27;t give my face that slight chalky white appearance that I used to have with my regular &amp;#34;Neutrogena Pure &amp; Free Liquid&amp;#34;. Citrus scent is strong when first applied (not unpleasantly so) but fades quickly. Love it!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer smells delicious - like oranges and gingerbread! It goes on smooth and soaks in quickly. I love it mostly for the fact that it is chemical free and non toxic. No parabens, phthalates, sulfates, artificial fragrance. Its organic and pure! and has SPF to keep skin youthful. I swear by this stuff and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another face lotion. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> The CON: the clear plastic cap for the product is useless. It falls off all the time. When I travel with this item in a toiletry bag, the lid doesn&#x27;t stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because it contains SAFE SPF ingredients and nothing too harsh for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout in pimples, YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also moisturizing enough without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again, unless I found something even more natural.</li>
    <li> Lightweight with a mild citrus fragrance. I need to use non-codemdogenic zinc or titanium based sunscreen, and most of what I have tried before are too thick for facial use - but this one is perfect! I have been using it for several weeks, and my skin is in good shape.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for several months now, and there are some major pros. It is a large amount of moisturizer for a natural product, first of all, almost double what any other brand offers. Second, all the ingredients are simple and there aren&#x27;t a ton of things in it to begin with. Third, it isn&#x27;t oily at all. It may leave a slight film on your face if it isn&#x27;t properly rubbed into the skin. It&#x27;s thin and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast. It does have a very herbal scent, which is nice unless you&#x27;re looking for unscented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tested this in extremely sunny conditions but so far so good! I don&#x27;t know if it actually fights acne as the packaging claims, but it&#x27;s an all around very solid natural skincare product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen/moisturizer in hopes of it finally being the perfect product to use for sun protection. I&#x27;ve had issues with sunscreens because most of the time, they have pore clogging ingredients that cause me to break out. I was really excited to see that this was packed with natural ingredients - but I didn&#x27;t read those ingredients well enough. After a couple days of use, I broke out like crazy. It was painful and it lasted an embarrassingly long amount of time. The only thing I&#x27;d changed in my routine was the addition of this product and I took a good look at the ingredients and lo and behold, there it was. Sea Algae Extract. Algae is wonderful as an anti-aging ingredient, but if people with sensitive, acne prone skin use it, they&#x27;re bound for a breakout. I honestly will never be using this again. So if you&#x27;re here for a sunscreen that&#x27;s safe for your sensitive, acne prone skin, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;If it weren&#x27;t for the algae, this would have been incredible. It smells really lovely, too. It&#x27;s refreshing, and it didn&#x27;t make my face look oily all day. I am just so disappointed that they had to include algae extracts. I should have looked at the ingredients more thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels great BUT the 3 times I&#x27;ve used this on my face I&#x27;ve been burnt... Red nose the lot! Does not provide much protection!</li>
    <li> I wish I could have given this 4-5 stars. Unfortunately, this product made my extremely oily skin even more oily. 1 hour after putting it on, my face looked like I had been at the end of a hard working day. Not sure if its because of the ingredients that are working to strip the oil from the face, therefore causing my skin to over react. Nether the less this product did not work for me :(</li>
    <li> Was told I needed multiple ingredients for sun protection and am glad to have found them in this moisturizer. It dries soft to the touch with a little glow.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent, sinks in nicely, but it breaks me out. I tried many times to make sure this is the one item that&#x27;s causing it, and sure enough, after taking a break for a week and starting over, the bumps appeared after two days of usage. I have tried extended usage too, so maybe I can get used to it, but no dice. I have since switched to the same brand&#x27;s daily moisturizer with 30SPF and it works great for me. I&#x27;ll just use this on my hands instead.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Nice, clean formula. Not as good for sun protection if you are outside for a prolonged period of time.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Can&#x27;t use anything else after trying it.  Works very well at keeping teen skin blemish free.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used! It is light, non-greasy, and has a pleasant lemony scent (very subtle). I have oily skin and have a hard time finding moisturizers that don&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy. I also use hydroquinone for hyper-pigmentation, which leaves my skin more sensitive to sun damage. I need to use a higher spf on my face, and this is one of the only moisturizers I have found with spf 30!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use this moisturizer every day and one bottle usually lasts me between 11-12 MONTHS! Definitely worth the money!!</li>
