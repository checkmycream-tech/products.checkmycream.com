<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice and thin.  Does not go on too thick.  Does leave your face a bit white for a few minutes, but it goes away.  No noticeable scent so the rest of the family can use it too.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It turns blue on skin</li>
    <li> for me rather a disagreably thick texture to spread on face and too white.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth. Not overly thick or oily. Good protection. I work outside so ts imperative that I wear protection. I recommend this to anyone that is going to be outside for any length of time. Will buy again..!!</li>
    <li> I just got this product. I started using it right away. I am out in the sun all day. This product doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like other sunscreens. It is very light on my face and it is not sticky. Also, it washes off with ease. I squired a lot out my mistakes, so i put some on my arms. Kept my arms moisturized but not greasy. Great sunscreen.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer !!! Defenetly will be buying more as gifts !</li>
    <li> Great Sunscreen. I always add sunscreen to my regular moisturizer, coz the sunscreens could be too white and it works perfectly and protects my skin well. Non greasy formula is great. Highly recommend it especially for summer time, but sunscreen is good for any season.</li>
    <li> This product absorbs in the skin well however, it leaves my face and neck with &amp;#34;face dandruff&amp;#34;. A white powdery substance on the face that gets into the hairline like dandruff. Very noticeably to others and in the mirror. I have used other face sunscreens and this has never occurred. I stopped using this on my face, I only use this sunscreen on my hands.</li>
    <li> I bought it to use on my face however it has a high zinc content so it is very thick and doesn&#x27;t glide on well.  Your face remains whitish as it doesn&#x27;t soak in.  It will be great for my body this summer though.</li>
    <li> It looks too white on the skin after applying.</li>
    <li> I recently received this sunscreen and I really like how it absorbs quickly and does not leave your skin feeling oily.  I also like that it didn&#x27;t have the strong smell like other sunscreens have.</li>
    <li> I love the other products in this line, but this one is terrible. It turns your face super white and it&#x27;s virtually unwearable. I have to toss the whole bottle. Bummed</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works well and doesn&#x27;t have the strong scent that most sunscreens do.</li>
    <li> It is already sunny and hot here in Florida so sunscreen is a must have daily. We were outside all weekend so I tried out the OZ Naturals Anti- Aging 30 SPF Sunscreen for the 1st time. Let me say a little bit goes a long way. At 1st I applied too much and was a little white looking so I had to wipe some off.(see photo below where I applied it to my hand to tes) It wasn&#x27;t sticky or greasy and sticky. I like that it is made with all natural ingredients. A lot of time that we spend outside is in the water so it would have been nice if this was waterproof as well. I reapplied after about 2 hours and ended the day with no sunburn. Definitely a great product if you are outside in the sun often. Keep your skin protected from damaging rays!&lt;br /&gt;I receieved this product for review purposes. However all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this product for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Before I went to the water park I applied the Oz naturals sunscreen and it left my face white but it did protect me from getting a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;I also applied it on my children and my husband all over before getting into the water and I did notice that the sunscreen as it was drying it crumbled up or flaked , that&#x27;s the part I didn&#x27;t like about the sunscreen but I do know that none of us got sunburned and we were protected by the sun using it. In the picture below you will see the Oz naturals sunscreen on my face and how it looked after I applied it. The other thing I noticed about the sunscreen is that since I do have sensitive skin and I did not break out so I will continue to be using the sunscreen until it runs out.</li>
    <li> sorry but it doesnt work well at all it just reminds me of cheap lotion</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals was kind enough to send me a bottle for review. I’d never used a zinc sunscreen before, but a few things I read said it was good for sensitive skin. I have rosacea, and have been having a really hard time finding something that doesn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen has no smell, which makes me kinda sad because I like sunscreen smell. At first it’s fairly normal sunscreen consistency. Not at all greasy, which is nice. Then you start rubbing it in, and realize that it’s pretty tough to rub in. And it leaves an incredibly white cast to your skin.I put it on one arm, and then because I wanted to give it a fair shot, my face. I looked a little bit like the Joker in Batman. BUT. My arm and face felt great the entire time we were outside. They never felt hot. They never felt like they were burning. And sure enough, I didn’t get one speck of sun wherever I put this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, bonus, my skin hasn’t broken out. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it, and am going to try the recommendation to mix it with moisturizer on my face.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s the best suntan lotion, I use it on  me and my husband.  All Oz Natural products are great!</li>
    <li> It is good.  My skin is very light and sensitive and I live in the Caribbean, trust me, it is good</li>
    <li> Incredibly visible white shadow on your face, especially if you have light stubble. Really having a hard time finding a non-toxic sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t have a white shadow though.</li>
    <li> Just right size for traveling, packaged well and secure tight top with no spillage! What I loved most was: not sticky, not smelly AND. You only need to use a little bit to go a LONG way! Has the correct ingredients to avoid UVA &amp; UVB! And it didn&#x27;t make me sweat like some other blocks do,</li>
    <li> I am disappointed by this since i loved all their serums and retinol moisturizers and use them religiously. This SPF is far too thick and leaves my face visibly whiter than the rest of my body, so it doesnt look good with or without make up. I have an olive skin tone so this really made me look terrible. wish I could get a refund or a different product, Oz naturals can you please help?</li>
    <li> Very watery and the instructions say to put on half hour prior and the bottle states something completely different. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> Did not like it at all!!! Makes my face way to white when using it,, takes forever to get in your skin,,i used OZ products and loved all of them except the sunscreen,, will not purchase this again! :(</li>
    <li> Yep, it fails at at actually being absorbed by the skin, so as another reviewer mentioned you will look like casper the friendly the ghost after applying it. Makes me wonder what all the high raters of this product are doing differently.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals Anti Aging - SPF 30 Mineral Sunscreen is the best natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve used to date. It provides the protection needed from the rays of the sun without the use of any harmful chemicals.  It&#x27;s made in the USA, never tested on animals, and 100% Vegan free. It contains  Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide known to give the ultimate protection against UVA and UVB rays preventing sunburn and damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that I know what many of the ingredients and vitamins are that make up this sunscreen. The combination of of aloe, green tea, sweet almond, sunflower, cocoa butter, vitamin E, and so on smell wonderful! The scent is light and sweet. It&#x27;s not what usually comes to mind when one thinks of sunscreen but I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is directed to apply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure and reapplying after two hours or sooner if swimming, sweating, or towel drying. It went on fairly easily and didn&#x27;t leave any undesirable white residue behind.  My skin wasn&#x27;t left feeling greasy or looking shiny but feeling soft and moisturized instead. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  I was able to apply my mineral makeup right on top of this! My skin is fairly sensitive and I&#x27;ve had zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work outside quite bit in my garden for a good bit of time each day and have found this SPF 30 sunscreen helps to prevent me from burning! Aside from protection it has anti-aging properties! I certainly recommend it. *I received a sample of the product for review purposes.*</li>
    <li> Left a pasty white residue even after rubbing it in thoroughly - my friends said &amp;#34;What&#x27;s that white stuff on your face?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Dries white and flakey, also does not spread easily or evenly.  I am returning it</li>
    <li> So far, I am liking this very much.  A little dab goes a long way, and it&#x27;s not overly dry or overly moist texture makes it easier to spread on. It does not feel or smell synthetic to me. I use it mainly on my neck and decolletage because that is where the sun has damaged me the most.  I still have hypopigmentation (white dots) there.  Instead of powder or liquid foundation, I use this.  I can see where it&#x27;s covering until I blend it in to create a more natural skin tone; and I feel less scorched, if at all, when the sun hits me there. I wear long neck scarves that I can adjust during the day to assist against high sun exposure moments, but this sunscreen has also definitely shielded me against this hot Georgia summer.  So far, it&#x27;s been a win-win and I don&#x27;t see that changing.</li>
    <li> Natural part is always good, but to have a pasty look does not make me happy .  Made a mistake putting it on going to work and had to wash my face in the last minute and to re-apply all the makeup on again.  I guess, if you are on the beach, it could be ok to  have white stripes all over your face, protection is more important than the look. But for everyday use it requires a lot of rubbing even with a small amount to get it absorbed.  Tried to use it with a small amount of water, as some people here recommend, but it was even worth, caking and peeling the layer of the serum that I always put on my face before applying sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;On a good note, it is perfect for my secretive skin, no watery eyes and no unpleasant scent, I wish there could be some improvement for everyday use..</li>
    <li> My search is over!!! I found the perfect sunscreen for my face. It made my zits dry out and I use in combination with rosehip oil. My skin is clean and glowing.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, but it&#x27;s terrible and I can&#x27;t believe anyone would give it a good rating.  No matter how thinly I applied it, it left a visible white chalkiness that never went away, even hours later. But that wasn&#x27;t even the worst part- it  was full of tiny white flakes that looked like chunks of paint. I was hoping to use it on my face, but it was so white and obvious, I felt self conscious even putting it on my forearms. It made me look like a construction worker with poor hygiene.   I threw away almost a full bottle.</li>
    <li> Honestly, this product is sticky, gets chunky easily, and doesn&#x27;t rub in well. It&#x27;s also comes in a 4 oz bottle, so with S/H the total was over $20.. not a great deal, although I admit I didn&#x27;t read the quantity in the details. Just not very impressed by this product. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural sunscreen that actually rubs in and doesn&#x27;t make you look all chalky, I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It smells good, especially compared to traditionally &#x27;natural&#x27; products for sunscreen. Its hard to find a sunscreen that is not smelly, stinky or sticky!  This one is just perfect!!!  This was great for my combination skin and did not leave it feeling oily at all! I have used this on myself and my husband and when I am done with this bottle, I will be buying another one to replace it.  A must have in summer!</li>
    <li> It is too thick, therefore it stays too white on skin. Additionally, it dries the skin and the protection is not felt. Would no recommend it.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the whitest physical sunscreen I have ever tried. You can try to rub it into your face but it will dry before you are able to even get it spread evenly on your face. The extreme white cast does not go away no matter what you do. Do not buy this sunscreen unless you want to look like a clown.</li>
    <li> My wife and I got this primarily to use on our face while we were in the Bahamas for the week. This product kept us from getting red or burned on our face, ears and neck as we were exposed to the sun each day. We also didn&#x27;t need a lot to cover our faces, but we did have to reapply frequently, at the very least every hour and a half, as we spent a good portion of our days in the water.&lt;br /&gt;My one caveat, it stays SOOO white. No matter how much rubbing we did or changing the amount, this thing made our faces look like ghosts. Then it would get flaky, especially in my facial hair or my wife&#x27;s eyebrows. Even after an hour, your face still looked ghostly. If you can look past that, this is a great product that does exactly what it says, it protects your skin. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients, so as far as sunscreen, it does its job. I like the consistency, it is a little runny, so it&#x27;s a time saver in that you can slap it on &amp; rub it in quickly. It does make your skin a bit white, due to the zinc, but zinc is an excellent blocker of the UV waves. I had to take off a star however, because if you keep on rubbing it in (and you have to, to make the white disappear) it starts rolling up in little balls. It does not work well under my makeup, which is extremely important to me. I need the sunblock on my face, I tend to get the brown sun damaged spots. Every other OZ product I have tried, I have loved, and I&#x27;ve tried most of them. So I was disappointed that this one did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was fairly easy to apply although it does take a bit of effort to make sure it is rubbed in completely. It does kind of whiten your skin, so you want to be careful to rub it in thoroughly so you don&#x27;t end up looking streaky. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands, arms, ears, and neck, while I use a different product that seems to be better formulated for my face. It does absorb better than some other products I&#x27;ve tried, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s kind of middle-of-the-road.</li>
    <li> This is a nice sunscreen, but I believe that their are other options available that are less pricey.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than a drugstore brand.  I do like the product, and I am a RAVING FAN of the rest of the OZ Naturals line, but I don&#x27;t think there is anything about this sunscreen that justifies this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a bit of a white look to your skin but that is expected because it is a mineral sunscreen.  I don&#x27;t believe there is a natural sunscreen out there that doesn&#x27;t have this same effect on my skin.  I use a tinted moisturizer over this and it helps counteract the ashy look and also adds moisture because this sunscreen is not as moisturizing as I would like.  I will use this bottle up but I doubt I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great sun protection, and I was really excited about it when I read all the reviews about how great it was. However I find that when I put it on, it doesn&#x27;t rub in well at all and makes my skin feel a little dry and rough.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen won&#x27;t rub in. The consistency is weird and it seems to dry on your face before you can finish applying it, and you&#x27;re left with dry white streaks everywhere that won&#x27;t rub in OR rub off.  I kept trying to use it myself and on my kiddos, thinking that &amp;#34;next time I&#x27;ll just rub it in faster&amp;#34; --needless to say, my kids are very annoyed at their well meaning mama, and hate this sunscreen too. VERY disappointing product. Does not deserve the title of &amp;#34;BEST Natural Sunscreen&amp;#34; (which is what I had google searched to find this)</li>
    <li> This stuff would be great for the beach but not as a daily sunscreen to wear under your makeup.  It&#x27;s hard to spread well and it turns white, which I hate.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have to be careful what products I use. This sunscreen is no scent, it absorbs into the skin quickly. It isn&#x27;t sticky.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> This SPF 30 mineral sunscreen contains 6% each of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide to physically block the sunlight from reaching the skin and causing damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a pleasant, almost neutral botanical fragrance instead of the usual awful sunscreen smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply and actually soothes irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 oz. bottle has a secure cap and slips right into a bag or pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  Apply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure. Reapply at least every two hours or after swimming, sweating or towel drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Aloe barbadensis leaf (aloe vera gel) juice, aqua (deionized water), Camellia sinensis (green tea) extract, ethylhexylglycerin, glycerin, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) oil, lecithin, octyl palmitate, phenoxyethanol, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil, Theobroma cacao (cocoa) butter, tocopherol (vitamin E), xanthan gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals provided sunscreen for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately my face had an awful allergic reaction. Puffy lifted skin with little white puss dots and itched. Effects lasted about a week with just one day of use. It was pretty awful experience. Of course they took it back with full refund.</li>
    <li> I have been using OZ Naturals for a couple years and love all the products ( Vit C, Vit A Serum, Toner, Eye Gel and the A Moisturizer.  The Natural Sunscreen is new for me - started using it Spring of 2015.  I love all of the natural ingredients, the antioxidants and especially like the fact that it has two powerful sunscreen agents, Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide. Even with these two sun screen powerhouses this product is not irritating to my sensitive skin.  I will share a secret on the application:  don&#x27;t rub it in too much or you may get little pilling effects.  I will lightly rub it in and then I gently pat it to finish off.  I saw a review complaining about the pilling and the whitish hue left behind.  You have my remedy on the pilling and the light white hue may be because you put too much on to begin with or, as with me, it fades and I always put foundation over the sunscreen so NO Problem!  I  will share that I did a lot of research on sun screens and now understand that if you want protection zinc oxide and titanium is the way to go ....I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for natural sunscreen options. We live in FL and spend a lot of time outside. I hate the thought of putting all of those chemicals on myself and my family, but sometimes natural options either don&#x27;t work or leave us looking like ghosts. :) This is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. It covers well, works and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue. I definitely recommend this product and plan on repurchasing when we&#x27;re through with this bottle!</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell this product does work... However, it makes you look WHITE! I am already fair and became ghost white. My friends who were darker looked purple! Even after trying to thoroughly rubbing it in, we still looked like we were wearing face paint. I honestly looked so ridiculous that I am looking for another natural sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t give that zombie-like after glow.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need much of this natural sunscreen to do the job. I used about a pea-sized amount for each arm going from shoulder down to my wrist, and achieved good coverage with no burning for a few hours after application. I&#x27;m Irish, so that will tell you something. I like that the scent is comprised only of the natural ingredients and is not overpowering like the fragrance of many sunscreens, even natural ones. It goes on smoothly and does not feel gloppy or sticky, and the natural, healthful ingredients are such that I feel comfortable using it on my children. Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> It leaves white cast on my skin. It&#x27;s also hard to blend well. Although it is non-irritating, there are some better physical sunblocks can do the same without leaving the white residue.</li>
    <li> When I was younger I pretty much refused to use sunscreen and unfortunately had to learn the hard way as I spent about 5-6 hours at the lake and sure enough I ended up getting 2nd degree burns all over my face,back,and shoulders. So with that being said every since that painful experience I am a huge fan of sunscreen and use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several OZ Naturals products so when I saw that they had this Natural Sunscreen I had to get it and try it out because 1.Oz Naturals has never let me down and 2. sunscreen brands/products are not the same! When I received the Oz Naturals Natural Sunscreen I applied it to my face which I realized that the sunscreen is pretty thick and you don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it to evenly apply or for it to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. There wasn&#x27;t too much of a smell that I personally could smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the next 2-3 hours out in direct sunlight and didn&#x27;t have any problems with it sweating off my face. I did NOT get burnt at all which is by far the true test to this sunscreen. The sunscreen is a little oily but as long as you don&#x27;t apply too much it&#x27;s not that big of a problem. I also have sensitive skin and this sunscreen didn&#x27;t give me any problems at all. I would definitely recommend this OZ Naturals Natural Sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> This thing left my face with a film of white residue. I&#x27;m shocked it has as many high reviews as it does. I&#x27;m a black woman, and this white residue doesn&#x27;t blend in with my skin tone AT ALL. I looked like Casper, the friendly ghost. Even tried rubbing coconut oil over it, and then adding foundation. Beneath it all, my face looked dry and pale. Not for me!</li>
    <li> Received this a couple days ago, have used it twice. Im sure its a very good sunscreen, but even just using a pea sized amount on my face left me looking like I had white clown makeup on. Took a long time to really sink in, but even then it left a white film like look on my face.  Will continue to use it, but just not on my face anymore.</li>
    <li> This sun screen is a white lotion that has very little scent to it.  I like the lack of a smell as I am not crazy about most sunscreen’s odors.  I have a fair complexion and sensitive skin so sunscreen is a regular routine for me.  This goes on without any oily or greasy feel and unlike others once I rubbed it into my skin, I didn’t have any white residue.  Maybe it is because I am fair complexion, I am not sure but I didn’t find this anymore difficult to rub into my skin than any other sunscreens.  I wore this while outside for about 3 hours and it protected me just fine. I like the fact it is all natural ingredients but I do think this is a bit expensive (currently 17 dollars) for a small 4 ounce bottle of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve used better drug store products than this.</li>
    <li> love this sunscreen. It does leave a bit of a white sheen, but oh well, it&#x27;s better than ruining my skin and causing pre-mature aging or worse. I&#x27;ve tried about two hand fulls and two feet fulls of natural sunscreen brands, and this one is my favorite.  I love Badger brand, but that one is way more thick than this one.</li>
    <li> So far im liking it alot! It goes on WHITE so mixing it with my day cream helps subdue the ghostly effect. It smells mild and goes on smoothly. Ive noticed that it also is less white and works well with a foundation. Im also happy it has titanium dioxide and zinc oxide..</li>
    <li> Too white, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I was sent this product free from OZ naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product on the beach last week in 100 degree weather in florida.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting what seemed to be a patchy sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;I should state I am olive toned and I don&#x27;t usually fly like that.&lt;br /&gt;I put 2 coats on my face and my face seemed to be okay but the paler parts of me such as my chest and upper arms fried!&lt;br /&gt;My father used it on his chest and stomach and also burnt. I&#x27;m not sure why it didn&#x27;t work for us because most OZ products I&#x27;ve tried I really like!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t mind giving it another try to be sure, but It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> It goes on a little white, but eventually it rubs in. I love that it is not oily. I would use it on my face, but I don&#x27;t because I use a better product that is matte instead.</li>
    <li> great protection from the sun as well as an all over body skin mousturizer.</li>
    <li> White and flaky. Does not work well under makeup. Still searching for my HG natural sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen daily on my face and arms. Upon initial application, it does leave a bit of a white cast, but the tip is to make sure that the product is massaged very well into the skin and then give the lotion some time to sink into the skin, about 3 - 5 minutes. Once it sinks in, the white cast is barely visible and disappears altogether when you continue with foundation/makeup/powder. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the dispenser on the bottle, I would have preferred a tube or pump as it is more hygienic than the tipping mouth opening on the current bottle.</li>
    <li> goes on very light and thin.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever use. It&#x27; so light in the skin and when Im wearing it, i dont need to put on any foundation or powder  because It blend smoothly &amp; beautifully on my face. It hides my dark spots &amp; wrinkles. I love it because it&#x27;s natural &amp; it&#x27;s not kind of chemical sunscreen, I feel safe using it everyday. I recommended it to my friends because they noticed the difference in my face. I&#x27;m very thankful I found this product!!</li>
    <li> I have many products of Oz Naturals - and they are great. This particular product, left my face white - I couldn&#x27;t go outside... my husband couldn&#x27;t stop laughing at me... he said I look like a ghost...  even after 30 minutes, my face was still white... had to return it</li>
    <li> Chose to try this product as I wanted to avoid oxybenzones.  It is also important to me that this product is not tested on animals.  Sunscreen is very effective at 30 SPF.  As I had been using a 50 SPF product, I was careful to reapply every 90 minutes as indicated on the label.  My favorite aspect is the light, non-greasy feel.  Product absorbs quickly and does not have a chalky appearance.  I will definitely be ordering this sunscreen on a regular basis.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved all the products I&#x27;ve tried by OZ Naturals so far, and I&#x27;m so glad they came out with a sunscreen.  I know that using sunscreen is important, but I often avoid using it because of all the chemicals and the greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen has mostly natural, easily recognizable ingredients.  I was afraid it would make my skin look white, and it does go on white, but when you rub it in the white goes away.  It doesn&#x27;t have an overly greasy feeling or residue on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes and I&#x27;m so glad to have it now that hot summer weather is coming!</li>
    <li> Certainly helped block the suns rays, but did not blend in the skin very well.</li>
    <li> Make my skin growing pimples .</li>
    <li> NO odor.  It&#x27;s a sun block---exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I used to think because of my dark skin I didn’t have to rely on sunscreen and when I was a child I didn’t have to. I could go outside all day and the sun would be beating down on me but I didn’t get sun burn like someone would if their skin is lighter. As I grew older and now in my late 20s and relocated from where I use to, I can’t do that anymore. I would sit outside in my backyard and within 15 minutes, my thigh would burn. I could feel the sun beating on my skin. Now I put on sunscreen and I love the OZ natural brand of sunscreen because it all natural and there is nothing harmful for my skin. The sunscreen blends in my skin really well, even though I did have to work it in. The only thing that this sunscreen is missing is “water resistant” or “waterproof” ability. If you are using it and go into the pool, it will wash off. So for sunscreen purpose only- for you ladies out there with beautiful dark skin just keep in mind; our skin does and will eventually be affected by the sun. Also, with sunscreen it will help reduce the sign of aging that the sun UV ray cause.  *This product is for an exchange for an unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen.  Tried lots of natural sunscreens and they didn&#x27;t blend well, were sticky, and paste-like.  Not this one!  We love it.  Yes, it leaves a white residue on your skin, but it is supposed to--- it is not a chemical barrier, it is a PHYSICAL barrier against UV rays.  The good thing is that the residue does not seem to transfer to clothing and it really stays on a long time, even during and after swimming.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the better sunscreen-- still goes on white, tho absorbed after a period of time</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has a pleasant neutral smell.  It goes on a bit thick, so I save it for days when I know my face will need better protection.  I also have a lighter weight sunblock for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes but a positive review was not asked for or promised or implied.  I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to applying sunscreen to my face.  I don&#x27;t like the thick, sticky, smelly Banana Boat type of sunscreens.  They make me feel gross and dirty even after I&#x27;ve washed my face.  Usually I use a lighter texture sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t smell for my face; that&#x27;s easy to wash off and feels smooth.  OZ Naturals Anti-Aging Solar Shield is a 100% Vegan and Cruelty free sunscreen that provides lightweight, non greasy protection against UVA/UVB sunlight.  It doesn&#x27;t have the weird sunscreen smell that you hate.  It&#x27;s smooth to apply on the skin and moisturizes all day long.  You just need a dab to cover your face and it&#x27;s all natural ingredients won&#x27;t irritate your skin.  As Baz Luhrmann says &amp;#34;Always wear sunscreen.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I got this item for free, and honestly I&#x27;m loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is very light on my skin, which is really really nice because most sunscreens are heavy and smelly.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention it&#x27;s so easy to put on! I put it on every day and I also put it on under my makeup and I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky, and overall it&#x27;s just a great product :)</li>
    <li> This is incredible.  Its a sunscreen and anti aging in one.  So I&#x27;m fighting the sun and old age at same time.  I am woman hear me roar!! This makes my face feel great too. I&#x27;m sensitive and this does not bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  This is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Overall good product. Was able to use this while working in the yard. Went on very easy, was not greasy &amp; absorbed quickly. Has a mild pleasant scent. Love that it is natural &amp; vegan. Only negative it&#x27;s that the directions on the box are different than the directions on the bottle. Also it would be nice to have the ingredients on the bottle. Received this product complimentary in order to use and review. No compensation was provided.</li>
    <li> I recently received  Oz Naturals Anti-Aging Solar Shield sunscreen free for testing. I apply to my face at least 15 minutes before i go outside, and it works great. It&#x27;s non greasy,the smell is not bad and it is made with ingredients I really like. It has aloe vera gel, green tea, cocoa butter, and vitamin e just to name a few. It has a SPF of, and i love that it is also Anti-Aging because that is just what the sun does, It ages out skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product though it leaves a grey film on my face... just need to rub a bit more to have it penetrate in my skin. Use only a pea for the whole face. It should be more fluid. I apply it on my moisturizer and it&#x27;s okay. I like the texture, it is not oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> As someone that is always out in the sun during the day I&#x27;m always in need of sunblock to protect me from the sun rays as I was excited to receive this Oz Naturals sunscreen in the mail!! After trying out this sunscreen for myself I have to say it works great!! I personally have issues with some sunscreens causing my skin to get irritated. This sunscreen however lives up to the non-irritating safe for all skin types description!! This sunscreen contains zinc oxide &amp; titanium dioxide minerals that provide broad-spectrum protection and shields your skin against harmful damage from both UVA and UVB rays!! One of my favorite things about this sunscreen is it is 100% natural!! It made of high quality natural ingredients including soothing Aloe Vera, which enhances sun protection!! It also includes amazing antioxidants such as vitamin E and Green Tea Extract as well as nourishing sweet almond oil!! These are all amazing ingredients to have in a sunscreen!! It is the perfect sunscreen for all skin types and is paraben free!! It can be worn under your makeup as well. This sunscreen also helps to prevent premature skin aging and protects your skin from skin cancer you get from sun exposure!! I definitely recommend this sunscreen to everyone and anyone.</li>
    <li> Was to thick even wen I used a lil  dosnt feel right on my face and didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding sunscreen that I will use, it either feels heavy, stinks or is sticky.  This stuff is great, it isn&#x27;t heavy, it goes on with a slight white so you can tell where you applied it, but easily blends in and has a faint scent, smells good.  It also mixes well with my daily moisturizer for an everyday sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Wearing non toxic sunscreen is important and this sunscreen is perfect. Most are so toxic that I&#x27;d rather use none and stay in the shade. I&#x27;ve tried sunscreens with all natural non toxic ingredients and they went on white, like paint and thick. Not a nice feeling in the hot sun.</li>
    <li> I tested this sunscreen during a hike today, and it seems to work fine. I like the fact that it&#x27;s all-natural. That seems important in products these days. We have too much cancer afoot in this society, and given the choice, I think most natural products are better than the alternative. I guess it&#x27;s not true in every case though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m guessing an SPF of 30 is enough.</li>
    <li> I like this natural sunscreen. I apply it to my face each day after my morning moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t sting and it absorbs quickly.  Be careful not to squeeze too much if using it for your face only. It takes a very small amount to cover the face and neck.</li>
    <li> I will have to return this. It makes my skin break out and it does not go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> White white white, and rubbing off all over my face. People kept asking me what was on my face. I&#x27;m trying so hard to find a healthier natural sunscreen. But this getting ridiculous. I am fair skinned, so if it looks obvious on me, well.</li>
    <li> I am so picky with sunscreen products, and I have tried so many that have irritated my skin and broke out with rashes.  Not to mention the awful scent that some sunscreen products can have on your skin.  The Oz Naturals Anti Aging Solar Shield is lightweight, moisturizing, non greasy, not irritating to my skin, and doesn&#x27;t have that weird sunscreen scent.  A little bit goes a long way on your face, and when I apply it on my legs, they feel moisturized all day, and it does not leave any residue.  I also like that it is an SPF 30, and that is just enough for an all natural sun protection!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Very light and very effectivel! I use sunscreen every day and this is perfect. It goes on easily and although I am very fair I have not even gotten pink!</li>
    <li> Finally!  A sunscreen that does not make my chest itchy.  For years I thought it was sun poisoning!</li>
    <li> Love al oz naturals products and still see the different in my skin</li>
    <li> It goes on too white and no matter how much I massage into my skin, it stays that way. Not crazy about it</li>
    <li> Really good product. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sunscreen that I don&#x27;t break out from.</li>
    <li> Pretty significant white cast that didn&#x27;t ever seem to soak in. It also got a little pilly as the day wore on and rubbed off. Not the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used by any means.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Inlove with this!!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great coverage - perfect for pairing with Retinol products!</li>
    <li> Upon opening this product from its packaging, I noticed that it&#x27;s 100% vegan and cruelty free (A major plus if you ask me). I also happen to notice that the directions on the bottle and the directions on the box are diferent; the bottle says to apply 3 minutes before sun exposure and on the box it says to apply 15 minutes before sun exposure. I&#x27;m mentioning this because it may be confusing for some people. The product itself is fairly good. It is scented; it smells like aloe vera, which is one of the main ingredients. I applied this on my face and I noticed a white cast but i also noticed that my face didnt get too greasy. The sun screen does leave a sort of tacky feel on the skin, so beware. I actually enjoyed this product but I don&#x27;t see myself repurchasing for the mere fact that sunscreen is not a thing I&#x27;m overly delicate with. I recieved this product in return for an honest opinion</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t decide if I will reorder, but it is a good sunsceen for body.  I don&#x27;t want to use under make-up, but it might be perfect for some facial  skins.&lt;br /&gt;I think people will be happy with it.  I like it for hands also if I am sitting in car with sun shining in.  thank you</li>
    <li> As others have stated &amp;#34;Used alone, this is a very *white* sunscreen since it is mineral-based. However, **mixed with a more water-based** moisturizing formula it seems to work great&amp;#34; this is true and some what annoying but overall it&#x27;s still a good natural sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that it doesn&#x27;t blend too well without adding some water, it does last for an hour or so if you&#x27;re swimming and must be re-applied but it last much longer if you&#x27;re not in water and that is a bonus. Overall great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. Not too thick, goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I go against convention when it comes to the sun. I believe that we are meant to get *some* sun (everything in MODERATION) because that is the way the body is *meant* to get Vitamin D (otherwise we would have developed livers like a horse has that converts stuff in our greens to Vitamin D ... they don&#x27;t get D from the sun at all). I also believe that most sunscreens are more harmful than the manufacturers let us know... it goes against *my* common sense to bake a bunch of chemicals into my skin ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a BIG fan of Zinc/Titanium Oxide based sunscreens ... because there WILL be those times when you have to be out in the sun for extended periods and need to protect your skin from overexposure and burning. So I was delighted to get the chance to review this product, and let me say I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it goes on white ... like any other product with the NATURAL minerals that make up the protective portion of the lotion. However, I found that it soaked in VERY quickly for a mineral-based sunscreen. I&#x27;ve bought many in the past that just plain are too thick and don&#x27;t absorb well. So that is Plus #1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus#2 is the truly natural ingredients. I&#x27;m an avid (maybe rabid!) ingredient checker and I look up anything I don&#x27;t know or that has a name that I can&#x27;t pronounce. The lotion has one ingredient that comes in that category: Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate. But a quick check found that this is a naturally derived , sugar-based surfactant that is very gentle and readily biodegradable and is used in  products for babies and individuals with sensitive skin. One other person on here claimed that the Xanthum Gum was natural but causes &amp;#34;digestive upset&amp;#34; ... however, that is only if you EAT something with Xanthum gum in it... and I personally have no intention of sipping on this bottle any time soon...LOL . Add to that that they have Aloe and Green Tea and a dash of Cocoa Butter in there and you have a really great product that will take great care of your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus #3 is how it feels on the skin afterwards. I really dislike anything that leaves a greasy or oily feel, and this product totally doesn&#x27;t do that. It not only soaked in immediately, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to wash my hands before touching anything that might be affected by anything oily (ie, phones screens/computers/etc), which is a testament to how well it soaks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus #4 is that it&#x27;s scent-free... or at least *I* don&#x27;t smell anything when I put it on and I did a pretty good sniff test. I know that some people are really sensitive to perfumes and such and I couldn&#x27;t detect anything that might trigger a reaction in those with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I can say this is something I have reviewed that I honestly would love to purchase in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.

    <li> Sensitive skin. Didn&#x27;t like all of the ingredients so I returned it without even opening the bottle</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind your face being white from the zinc and really want protection then this is the product for you. I didn&#x27;t like it turning my skin white but for my husband who had melanoma, he will be using it.</li>
    <li> One of the best sunscreens I have ever used. Very light and not greasy. Was at the beach for a week and it worked wonderfully on my husband and I. I am impressed with all the OZ products. I will continue to use them and share with friends and family. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen every day under makeup. Haven&#x27;t really had the chance to give it a full test as I live in MA and we are having a bout of extremely cold and snowy weather. I will update later when the weather changes.</li>
    <li> I love all other Oz Naturals products, but this is the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves a white sheen on your face that is very noticable, even if you spread it out or use a lesser amount. It&#x27;s especially more noticable if you have darker skin. Plus the instructions say to use reapply the product every 90 minutes, after exercise, or after swimming to be effective!</li>
    <li> First things first, this is vegan and cruelty free which is awesome. My favorite thing about this product is its actives. Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide are physical blockers which means they are not absorbed into the blood stream but also means the product will protect you longer. These sit on the surface of skin reflecting light rather than chemical sunscreens that work through the layers of skin. Chemical sunscreens absorb sun light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is white cast and of a heavier weight you&#x27;d expect with sunscreen. The photos are of my legs. It does have a white cast as you can see but that&#x27;s almost guaranteed with 6% zinc oxide. My biggest qualm with this sunscreen, and why I removed a star, is that it piles. I tried patting it on, rubbing, and nothing stopped it from clotting up. On my legs though, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, you could try putting on a moisturizer before hand to create a less dry environment than my legs appear to be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HINT: If you look closely, my knees look like Ninja Turtles</li>
    <li> This sun screen is thick and leaves a white pasty look on my face and I don&#x27;t like the feel of it and how it interacts with make-up.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and it does offer good protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunblock because it&#x27;s organic and I love there products , but this leaves your face dry and white.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizing. My skin did feel really soft each time I removed it.&lt;br /&gt;-Non-irritating ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;-Decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Sunscreen ingredients sit on the skin. I could never get them to fully absorb into the skin. It just leaves a mask on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to rub in. First it seems watery out of the tub. I could never rub it in without it being streaky. It also dried quickly, which meant that the streaky look stayed on my skin. If I tried rubbing more, it would pill and fall off. All that rubbing hurt my sensitive cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;-The white cast. I wore this the morning I got it. People asked me why I had cold cream on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-It cracked after drying. Even if I ended up without the uneven coverage and covered the whiteness with foundation, it would crack and rub off throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was such a disappointment. I thought the good reviews meant it would be perfect for me. Three days was all I could put up with this. This experience shows that just because something works for others does not mean it will work for you.</li>
    <li> This is the best Zinc Oxide facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s much lighter weight than others and rubs in well.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of this sunscreen.  It is milky with a very light sent and not greasy at all.  The only thing I do not like is the white film it leaves in my skin.  It takes a few minutes for the product to sink into the skin, so I&#x27;ve had to take this into consideration in my morning routine.  But there is always just that little bit of white left on your face.  Since my skin is light to medium with cool undertones, it is not a terrible thing, a little bit of CC cream on top and my tone actually looks more even.  This is the first time I use a mineral sunscreen, so I do not have much to compare it to, but I understand that this white residue is common in all of them. It is not extremely moisturizing, so it is a great option for the summer, but I will go with something else during the winter months. UPDATE: After a couple of months of using this sunscreen in my face, I had to eliminate it from my routine since my skin became dull, my pores clogged and every once in a while I would get a pimple.  After 14 days off, my skin has come back to normal, so this was definitely the culprit.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen. I mix it with their sea infused moisturizer and it rubs in smooth without a white residue. So far I have never been sunburned while using it. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I received this for consideration for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals Natural Sunscreen is okay for a natural mineral sunscreen. I find that the levels of Zinc Oxide and Titanium Oxide are a little on the low side for my preference and I don&#x27;t trust it for very long wear in direct sun. But for day to day protection, out running around, to and from my car, under makeup and so on, it does a pretty nice job keeping the harsh rays of the Arizona sun from burning my fair skin. I would give this five stars if the Zinc Oxide number were higher.</li>
    <li> This is great for sun coverage.  My husband wears it for golf.  Might need a few minutes to sink into skin and be absorbed.  But worth the wait.  I am trying out some other Oz products and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen. I use this company&#x27;s moisturizer and cleanser, and feel good knowing it&#x27;s natural. I combine this with a little moisturizer in the mornings. If I use it alone, it shows up chalky on my dark skin. Combining it with moisturizer helps it blend well.</li>
    <li> I got this to take to NASCAR in Vegas, we all know how hot that can get.  Well, I can say I did NOT get sunburned, I little pink that was gone by the next day.  I was there two days, two races.  Used it again the next day, really stayed out in the stadium, the true test, it worked for all day protection.  If I were to say anything on a negative, kinda white, it&#x27;s rubs in really nice but leaves and white sheen on the skin.  Smells nice too.  I give it 2 thumbs up.  I do get products for reviews, but what good is getting products if they&#x27;re not good. With that being said, I will always be as honest as MY experience allows ;)</li>
