      <li>Used this on my hair and made it more soft and easier to manage :)</li>
      <li>So far I am in love with this product!</li>

      <li>I can just put it on really quick wile driving to my event.</li>
      <li>The product has a pleasant smell and all it takes is a light tough of this product to help my scalp feel better.  </li>
      <li>I have tightly curled hair, so it works great for me.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this since it is creamy and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Not too oily, just right</li>
      <li>i put it in right after i wash and condition my hair</li>
      <li>After one week I find that it smells more like true olive oil, so then I wash it out and reapply to my hair once it&#x27;s been flat ironed.</li>
      <li>My hair is actually growing and appears to be healthy.  </li>
      <li>This product is exactly what was needed.  </li>
      <li>hair feels soft, smooth &amp; looks shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My dry hands like it better than my hair.</li>
      <li>But one day shopping here on Amazon I ran across this hair cream and thought I would give it a try due to all the positive reviews ( One of things I love about amazon the reviews)  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t put too much as it is oil and will grease up your hair.</li>
      <li>but if you use too much, your hair will become too oily.</li>
      <li>Now... I don&#x27;t buy into much being truly &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; these days, but if that&#x27;s your bag, this might not be for you....</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t use as directed (styling my hair with it, it makes my hair much too greasy)</li>
      <li>Decided one day to look online and found them at a much lower price.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super duper easy to wash out the next morning (WAY easier than using virgin coconut oil) and has left my hair softer and shinier than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many other products</li>
      <li>This stuff works great on her for making small ringlets that last all day.</li>
      <li>After using this product now for several weeks my hair is now soft and easy to maintain without all the dryness.</li>
      <li>The old formula didn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all.</li>
      <li>Works really well on our 18 month old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves her hair soft, shiny &amp; very manageable.  </li>
      <li>I have African-American, in-between hair with deep waves more than &amp;#34;curl&#x27;s&amp;#34; and it can be extremely dry.</li>
      <li>My hair is extremely dry and this is the only thing that gives it a healthy shine.</li>
      <li>Her hair tends to be very dry &amp; tangles/mats very easily if left in a style for more than a day.</li>
      <li>With the new one, all I can smell all day is the perfume in this stuff.</li>
      <li>Now I need to find a new product.</li>
      <li>But so far no negative effect.</li>
      <li>Be careful, too much use at once or within a week will make you hair very oily ...</li>
      <li>It makes my hands feel soft, and my hair is so moist and soft with it in.</li>
      <li>I realized how soft it made my hands</li>
      <li>We put it on at night and her hair is soft in the morning.</li>
      <li>this product leaves your hair soft, no flakes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>good product - but was too expensive.</li>
      <li>Within hours I noticed that the redness of my stretch marks had blended with my skin tone and even the dark scars on my arm from a dog attack last year were significantly lightened.</li>
      <li>Came in a couple of days and they are vacuum sealed so they will stay fresh until I need to open the next jar.  </li>
      <li>I may have to re-apply only once during the week, using a little ECOCO Eco Style Gel, Olive to smooth my edges.  </li>
      <li>The new formula smells gross.</li>
      <li>I normally use it after flat ironing my hair.</li>
      <li>But this has done a lot for my hair in general.</li>
      <li>and this is the only product that works and doesn&#x27;t make me look or smell like I am old and greasy.  </li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar for my daughter &amp; it&#x27;s a MUST when styling her hair.</li>
      <li>I prefer using it in cold weather because it&#x27;s heavier and is a good protectant against the elements....perfect for fly-aways and ends, too.</li>
      <li>I am white with a young daughter that is black/white/native american.</li>
      <li>I have very thick curly hair and have always found it hard to find a good after shower hair cream.  </li>

    <li> I just bought this for my son who is 16 months and has thick curly hair. I have tried so many other products but they were not good at all and they left a build up in his hair. So far I am in love with this product!</li>
    <li> I am white with a young daughter that is black/white/native american. This stuff works great on her for making small ringlets that last all day. When I would apply it to her hair I realized how soft it made my hands so I started applying it to my badly stretch marked belly as well as on my arms. Within hours I noticed that the redness of my stretch marks had blended with my skin tone and even the dark scars on my arm from a dog attack last year were significantly lightened. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Still evaluating it since i have just started it and do not use it regularly for now. But so far no negative effect.</li>
    <li> Not too oily, just right</li>
    <li> The product arrived within the promised time. It was just as advertised. I am happy with this experience and will shop here again.</li>
    <li> My scalp is extremely dry and I searched for a product to alleviate this problem.  The product has a pleasant smell and all it takes is a light tough of this product to help my scalp feel better.  It gives more life to my hair.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I use this as a  cuticle cream.  I just dip my fingertips in the jar and rub into my cuticles.</li>
    <li> Best hair cream eveeeer</li>
    <li> This is a really good product, it makes the hair soft and manageable. My hair is extremely dry and this is the only thing that gives it a healthy shine. The jar usually last about a year, a little goes along way.</li>
    <li> nice not too greasy my hair is naturally curly and this cream does not weigh it down i put it in right after i wash and condition my hair</li>
    <li> Did not do what I expected, but I bought it so I will use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I have tightly curled hair, so it works great for me.</li>
    <li> this product is very good, anytime you use olive oil for your skin or hair You can see the results.i recently started to get dandruff really bad and needed something to moisturize my scalp and hair. I bought this product and \\&quot;Behold\\&quot; moisturized wavy hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great! extreme hair growth!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Used this on my hair and made it more soft and easier to manage :)</li>
    <li> EXCELENT, IS THE ONE I USE MORE, WITH ROLLS</li>
    <li> You will only need a small amount of this on your tresses,as a little goes a long way. I prefer using it in cold weather because it&#x27;s heavier and is a good protectant against the elements....perfect for fly-aways and ends, too. I normally use it after flat ironing my hair. After one week I find that it smells more like true olive oil, so then I wash it out and reapply to my hair once it&#x27;s been flat ironed. I don&#x27;t use it when I wet set my hair (which is my style of choice), because I do believe that it would weigh my hair down too much.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what was needed.  It&#x27;s light weight but has enough oil content that it is making a great difference with the softness and strength of my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells good, not something that will annoy everyone around you. It makes my hands feel soft, and my hair is so moist and soft with it in. Plus it gives it a sleek look of gel without the having to worry about washing gel off your hands. I use it when I am in a rush and i don&#x27;t have time to use gel. I can just put it on really quick wile driving to my event. Note: your hands will be oily for some time until it absorbs in, so be careful if you do use with while driving. You have been warned. But other than that. Its kind of pricey, but worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Good product. Be careful, too much use at once or within a week will make you hair very oily ... Yuck !</li>
    <li> I use this mostly on my daughter who has 4c(???, lol) African American hair. Her hair tends to be very dry &amp; tangles/mats very easily if left in a style for more than a day. Using this hair creme I can easily comb through &amp; detangle her hair. It also leaves her hair soft, shiny &amp; very manageable.  Ive even noticed substantial hair growth using this as it keeps her hair so moisturized &amp; stops breakage. For me it only works well as a hand moisturizer. I have maybe 3b/3c African American hair. It makes my hair look dull &amp; dry. It doesn&#x27;t soften my hair like it does my daughter, it just kinda sits on top of it. This is probably the only ors product I can&#x27;t use tho. So far I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar for my daughter &amp; it&#x27;s a MUST when styling her hair.</li>
    <li> This item is too heavy for my thick afro curly hair. It also has mineral oil, petroleum, AND dimethicone in it, so it rather suffocates my strands instead of penetrating them, and after I take my twists down the next day I have crunch, bushy hair. I really wanted to like this since it is creamy and goes on smoothly. My dry hands like it better than my hair.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my hair. I gave it away to a friend. It didn&#x27;t work for her either. The best thing to do is mix real olive oil and mix it with your regular condition. That will do the trick.</li>
    <li> The reason that I ordered this product was because I had already purchased one at Walgreens a couple of months ago.  The product is light and not greasy.  Adds a nice sheen to my hair.  Will reorder this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Its not pasty and not too wet. Just wish the jar was a little bigger. Great price for it though.</li>
    <li> Had given up and accepted dry, brittle hair as just another &#x27;old-age&#x27; problem. Had tried many, some very expensive products, on my dry, damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;One simple application with the Organic Root Stimulator did the trick.....My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this shiny and healthy in many years.</li>
    <li> yeah, yeah..mineral oil isn&#x27;t the best for your hair, but this product does a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels soft, smooth &amp; looks shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I co-washed my hair last evening, slathered this on my strands, and when I woke up--moisturized hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair cream for years.  I have very dry hair and this is the only product that works and doesn&#x27;t make me look or smell like I am old and greasy.  I had been buying this product at my local Walgreen&#x27;s store.  Decided one day to look online and found them at a much lower price.  Must be a big markup in the stores.  I bought several jars so I could get free shipping.  Came in a couple of days and they are vacuum sealed so they will stay fresh until I need to open the next jar.  Great product and the price is right!</li>
    <li> the product came in late. but the seller communicated well with me so its okay. I will definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works really well on our 18 month old daughter&#x27;s hair.  Smell is neutral.  We put it on at night and her hair is soft in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have very thick curly hair and have always found it hard to find a good after shower hair cream.  The ones I did find where very expensive usually and then after I finally found one it was discontinued.  But one day shopping here on Amazon I ran across this hair cream and thought I would give it a try due to all the positive reviews ( One of things I love about amazon the reviews)  Well, that was 6 months ago and I can tell you that this stuff really works well on curly thick thirsty dry hair.  The best part is you don&#x27;t need much, just a a little bit on your hands rub it in and you will love the control and look you get with this cream.  Plus you can&#x27;t be the price either and a little jar goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The new formula smells gross. Why can&#x27;t manufacturers leave well enough alone? The old formula didn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all. With the new one, all I can smell all day is the perfume in this stuff. Now I need to find a new product.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for my hair.  My hair is actually growing and appears to be healthy.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Smell amazing and makes hair feel softer. Don&#x27;t put too much as it is oil and will grease up your hair. This product should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizing for hair i have been using&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair shiny and healthy looking</li>
    <li> just no...it smells bad and does nothing. i was expecting something completely different. i dont like it at all lol</li>
    <li> This works but if you use too much, your hair will become too oily. I&#x27;d only use this if I&#x27;m doing a home wash &amp; bun, other than that, I&#x27;d stay away from this product build up</li>
    <li> I am, quite literally, NEVER without this product.  Tried it once on a whim because Olive Oil seems to perform exceptionally well in my hair and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  A little really does go a LONG way and I only reapply when necessary.  I have African-American, in-between hair with deep waves more than &amp;#34;curl&#x27;s&amp;#34; and it can be extremely dry. I will lightly oil my scalp with Palmer&#x27;s Gro Therapy Olive Oil and then use about a quarter size dollop of this to rub all over and into my ends. I may have to re-apply only once during the week, using a little ECOCO Eco Style Gel, Olive to smooth my edges.  This product truly is for &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34; hair.  Now... I don&#x27;t buy into much being truly &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; these days, but if that&#x27;s your bag, this might not be for you.... I just know that it works and my hair is super healthy!</li>

    <li> I put this on my hair every night before bed. I couldn&#x27;t use as directed (styling my hair with it, it makes my hair much too greasy) but I didn&#x27;t plan on that to begin with. I use it to help combat scalp psoriasis issues. But this has done a lot for my hair in general. It&#x27;s super duper easy to wash out the next morning (WAY easier than using virgin coconut oil) and has left my hair softer and shinier than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
    <li> This product is working well for me. My hair is extremely dry and brittle. After using this product now for several weeks my hair is now soft and easy to maintain without all the dryness.</li>
