### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I read about Amlactin in Reader&#x27;s Digest and thought I would give it a try, and I am very happy I did.  </li>
      <li>Great Product!</li>
      <li>I saw excellent results within a week -</li>
      <li>The foot cream is also very good.</li>
      <li>Great lotion.</li>
      <li>Amlactin is great, non-greasy,penetrates and lasts.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of good moisturizing lotions on the market, for me</li>
      <li>found a really good electric callous remover; it is made by Bario and hopefully you can find one with a google search.</li>
      <li>isn&#x27;t all together pleasant - kind of medicinal - I suspect from the ammonia.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for two years and my ichtiosis vulgaris is much better now!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>But as it gets rubbed the smell turns kind of like ammonia.  </li>
      <li>waited for a couple of weeks of use to review this product because often I&#x27;ve found products that seem to work great at first</li>
      <li>though might have better luck then me.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s an okay lotion.  </li>
      <li>I have invested more money than I care to remember in all kinds of creams and lotions claiming to soften skin; my problem areas are my palms and soles of feet.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I like the pump style the best, I&#x27;ve rated and purchased this item for gosh the last 3 or 4 years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Amlactin for many years and it has worked wonders.</li>
      <li>Wish it would have worked better</li>
      <li>I did some more</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t really pleased with the expense, odor, and clammy</li>
      <li>AmLactin, however, has done more to keep mine under control than anything else I have used.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and have tried others to see if there is anything better out there.  </li>
      <li>Hope it works as well for you  :)</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure if it works on the Keratosis Pilaris on my arms.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to discover an effective product that&#x27;s not outrageously expensive.</li>
      <li>I have very dry and cracked skin and have tried many products, this one works the best.</li>
      <li>and my skin feels more smooth.</li>
      <li>Great non-greasy lotion that works great for dry skin and really helps with kerotosis pilaris.</li>
      <li>idk if something in it is to strong for my skin or if its an allergic reaction</li>
      <li>I can say that it seems to smooth out the discoloration on my arms though</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My elbows are smooth, no cracking or irritation at all.   </li>
      <li>The chemical smell is very powerful and off-putting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve NEVER had such amazing results like this with a lotion!  </li>
      <li>For first use it was okay</li>
      <li>aware, this lotion is strong.</li>
      <li>Again, most people obviously love it, but everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different.</li>
      <li>However, considering that my hands haven&#x27;t felt this good forever, I can put up with the strange odor.  </li>
      <li>Nice product does not have a strong smell like other people have commented</li>
      <li>But the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>I use other lotions that people give me sometimes, but none are as good as Amlactin at keeping the fire at bay or putting it out once it is triggered.</li>
      <li>However it is a very light scent and once it dries the only way you can smell it is if you press your nose right up to your skin.</li>
      <li>Amazon provided a full refund and I will not continue using this particular bottle.</li>
      <li>I did not expect results this fast, but results I have received!  </li>
      <li>eventually will cause more irritation after a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>never again will I ever purchase anything but AmLactin, Makes your skin so soft does what it is suppose to do, I would also say if your planning on going out for the evening after using this, just apply a light coat...</li>
      <li>Not too happy that the product contain aluminum - which is definitely not good for you.</li>
      <li>But once it dries the smell is pretty much gone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After much trial and error, the best I could do was Euercin ointment which is thick, gooey and left my skin greasy</li>
      <li>and I find this body lotion very helpful.</li>
      <li>Product arrived fast, with no hastles.   </li>
      <li>and it really didn&#x27;t help the cause.  </li>
      <li>I really hope those like me who have about given up hope of ever having semi-normal skin read this, try it and are helped like I have been!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I paid too much but really needed it.  </li>
      <li>However, the product works very well.</li>
      <li>It really moisturizes and softens my skin.  </li>
      <li>I was really hoping it would work for me</li>
      <li>Using it on a regular basis has made my skin very soft and smooth...</li>
      <li>I wash my hands many times a day and found it did not let me down.</li>
      <li>I have seen a noticable difference in my skin, less redness and a more even skin tone.</li>
      <li>I have mild to moderate psoriasis flare ups</li>
      <li>Most moisturizing lotions do little to nothing for KP.</li>
      <li>When you live in an area with no shopping</li>
      <li>and I can totally live with this because of the results I&#x27;ve experienced!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I continued to try different creams and lotions and have settled on one that really works and works fast -</li>
      <li>The lotion absorbs quickly, Within a week I noticed a reduction in dry areas and increased skin elasticity.</li>
      <li>I also use it and am very surprised at how well it works.  </li>
      <li>For the first time since I was very young, my skin actually looks and feels normal!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far, nothing does the job like this lotion.</li>
      <li>I have always suffered from sensitive skin so if i had KP</li>
      <li>The KP isn&#x27;t cured, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely.</li>
      <li>and I notice a difference in how soft my arms feel</li>
      <li>This was recommended by my dermatologist to help exfoliate and smooth rough, dry skin.  </li>
      <li>The only other thing I can say which isn&#x27;t really a pro or a con either way is that it doesn&#x27;t have the consistency of normal lotion.</li>
      <li>This particular bottle smelled very strange and chemical-like.</li>
      <li>But it has become barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for anyone with dry or cracked skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whilst not curing my KP or even making my skin look a bit better at least it makes it feel not as dry</li>
      <li>I made the mistake the first time of using the same amount I would use of other lotions...</li>
      <li>If your skin is sensitive, test it on a small area first.</li>
      <li>At first, it just smells a little like elmers glue.  </li>
      <li>This makes it a little harder to rub in but it dries quickly.</li>

<li> Even putting it on the dry calluses on your feet they are gone in a week.</li>
<li> My dry, cracked and bleeding feet and hands are HEALING!!!&lt;br</li>
<li> After a lifetime of dealing with complicated skin issues which include SEVERE dryness, VERY sensitive skin and a few rare skin conditions</li>
<li> I tried AMLACTIN and have never had dry skin again!</li>
<li> the next time I used a dollop about half the size of a dime, and it is plenty for each foot.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this on the recommendation of my dermatoligist, for rough dry skin. After only one week, not only are most of the bumps gone (chicken skin) but my skin is looking younger and tighter. (an added plus)</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s a personal thing. But for me, i hate the way this lotion feels, hate the way it smells, hate the way it works. Again, most people obviously love it, but everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Having grown up with very dry skin that would become red and irritated in the cold winters, I had tried every other product for dry skin - with no success. I tried AMLACTIN and have never had dry skin again! Even putting it on the dry calluses on your feet they are gone in a week. The product might sting slightly in the beginning- that means its working and it lessens to nothing. It has saved my skin!</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of dealing with complicated skin issues which include SEVERE dryness, VERY sensitive skin and a few rare skin conditions I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars trying to find products that work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much trial and error, the best I could do was Euercin ointment which is thick, gooey and left my skin greasy but it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this based on recommendations from those with the red bumps on arms and legs.  I also have that issue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited for a couple of weeks of use to review this product because often I&#x27;ve found products that seem to work great at first eventually will cause more irritation after a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I didn&#x27;t expect this to work so well or I would have thought to take before photos of my hands, feet and arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve NEVER had such amazing results like this with a lotion!  For the first time since I was very young, my skin actually looks and feels normal!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was so bad - red, dry and always rashy - that I was asked all the time if I had poison oak which left me wearing long sleeve shirts year around.  My dry, cracked and bleeding feet and hands are HEALING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have not experienced severe skin problems may not understand how frustrating and embarassing skin conditions can be.  I really hope those like me who have about given up hope of ever having semi-normal skin read this, try it and are helped like I have been!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about this lotion is that it absorbs into the skin and actually hydrates rather than just sitting on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only small complaint I have is that the ingrediants create an ammonia smell once it&#x27;s absorbed.  I understand the need for these components in order for the Ph to be what it is to work.  The smell goes away after about an hour and I can totally live with this because of the results I&#x27;ve experienced!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please try this if you have dry, rough, red, bumpy skin!!!  Hope it works as well for you  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short while so I can&#x27;t say for sure if it works on the Keratosis Pilaris on my arms. I can say that it seems to smooth out the discoloration on my arms though and my skin feels more smooth. The only negative I have to say about it is that it&#x27;s smell isn&#x27;t all together pleasant - kind of medicinal - I suspect from the ammonia. However it is a very light scent and once it dries the only way you can smell it is if you press your nose right up to your skin. The only other thing I can say which isn&#x27;t really a pro or a con either way is that it doesn&#x27;t have the consistency of normal lotion. It almost feels like lotion and dry oil mixed together. This makes it a little harder to rub in but it dries quickly. I will continue to use it to see what results I can get.</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast, with no hastles.   When you live in an area with no shopping it&#x27;s the easiest way to go.</li>
    <li> This product is expensive but a little goes a long way and it seems to help quite a bit with my Keratosis pilaris</li>
    <li> I have had problems with dry skin and cracking, especially my feet and elbows. Nothing worked. I read about Amlactin in Reader&#x27;s Digest and thought I would give it a try, and I am very happy I did.  After only 3 days, using once a day at bedtime, the callouses are gone from my feet and the cracking is gone. I did not expect results this fast, but results I have received!  My elbows are smooth, no cracking or irritation at all.   While it seems expensive, a very tiny bit goes a very long way. I made the mistake the first time of using the same amount I would use of other lotions...the next time I used a dollop about half the size of a dime, and it is plenty for each foot.  Highly recommended for anyone with dry or cracked skin.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended AmLactin and Carmol 20 Cream to help with severe dry cracked heels. I used both products for several weeks into a couple of months and had *some* improvement but there was still a ways to go before I&#x27;d say my feet were going to be \\&quot;baby soft\\&quot;. I wasn&#x27;t really pleased with the expense, odor, and clammy feel that I&#x27;d experience with this combination and still getting lackluster results, so I did some more searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a really good electric callous remover; it is made by Bario and hopefully you can find one with a google search. I continued to try different creams and lotions and have settled on one that really works and works fast - [[ASIN:B004RYKWGM O&#x27;Keefes Creme]]. This creme is inexpensive, non-greasy, and unscented. I saw excellent results within a week - the elusive \\&quot;baby soft\\&quot; feet everyone has been talking about. Finally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope everyone finds *something* that works for them.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. Great non-greasy lotion that works great for dry skin and really helps with kerotosis pilaris.</li>
    <li> I like the pump style the best, I&#x27;ve rated and purchased this item for gosh the last 3 or 4 years. I am diabetic and believe me this is the only lotion that works. Recently had tried other well known lotions for Diabetics which caused my skin to break out now facing the results of 2 biopsy&#x27;s because of  so called other brands. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other Diabetic lotions this was recommended by my doctor. Taught me one thing if you like a product stay with it never again will I ever purchase anything but AmLactin, Makes your skin so soft does what it is suppose to do, I would also say if your planning on going out for the evening after using this, just apply a light coat...Love this product.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and cracked skin and have tried many products, this one works the best. The foot cream is also very good.</li>
    <li> Not too happy that the product contain aluminum - which is definitely not good for you. However, the product works very well.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s an okay lotion.  It was recommended by a doctor and it really didn&#x27;t help the cause.  Wish it would have worked better</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist to help exfoliate and smooth rough, dry skin.  She said it can also help get rid of moles I have on my face rather than freezing them off.  It&#x27;s also a moisturing body lotion. Great Product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion for my husband who has terribly rough, dry hands.  I also use it and am very surprised at how well it works.  The skin on my hands cracks and bleeds during the winter months, starting in October and going all the way thru May.  But when I use this lotion, my hands look about 20 years younger.  The redness and dryness is GONE!  I only have one complaint....the smell.  At first, it just smells a little like elmers glue.  But as it gets rubbed the smell turns kind of like ammonia.  It dissipates after awhile, but I was not expecting it.  However, considering that my hands haven&#x27;t felt this good forever, I can put up with the strange odor.  I&#x27;ll have to update my review after my husband uses it for a while.  The jury is still out if it&#x27;s going to help his hands or not.</li>
    <li> I have used Amlactin for a long time, back in the day when it was prescription only, it was the only thing that could tame my eczema beast!  Today, it is still my number one.  There are a lot of good moisturizing lotions on the market, for me Amlactin is the only thing I have found that can take the fire out of my skin, as well as moisturize.  I use other lotions that people give me sometimes, but none are as good as Amlactin at keeping the fire at bay or putting it out once it is triggered.</li>
    <li> I have mild to moderate psoriasis flare ups and I find this body lotion very helpful. If you use this as soon as you notice a flare coming on it can help the overall severity. A plus is the almost lack of fragrance so you can still use your regular fragrance without conflict.</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research before buying this product, bought it as i have KP. Nice product does not have a strong smell like other people have commented I did not notice any smell.  Goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst not curing my KP or even making my skin look a bit better at least it makes it feel not as dry maybe they need a stronger formula to compete with extortionately priced Retina A cream.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a health column in our local newspaper.  It&#x27;s nice to discover an effective product that&#x27;s not outrageously expensive.</li>
    <li> Amlactin is recommended by my podiatrist for cracked feet.  It is simply a miracle.  Costco used to carry it so I bought it online.  I paid too much but really needed it.  Costco now has it back.</li>
    <li> There is a slight ammonia odor as others have mentioned, but I have not encountered any other product that works as effectively on dry skin. The lotion absorbs quickly, Within a week I noticed a reduction in dry areas and increased skin elasticity. I think the alpha hydroxy acids are also diminishing sun damage on my hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Amlactin for many years and it has worked wonders. This particular bottle smelled very strange and chemical-like. It was leaking when it arrived so perhaps that had something to do with it. Amazon provided a full refund and I will not continue using this particular bottle.</li>
    <li> I have invested more money than I care to remember in all kinds of creams and lotions claiming to soften skin; my problem areas are my palms and soles of feet. Only one product, a medicinal cream which was absolutely terrific that I found when I lived in Sweden. But costs to have that sent to me here in then US with customs and postage was not viable in the long run. Amlactin is great, non-greasy,penetrates and lasts. I wash my hands many times a day and found it did not let me down. C Strandell</li>
    <li> It really moisturizes and softens my skin.  I have used this product for many years and have tried others to see if there is anything better out there.  So far, nothing does the job like this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have (had!) little red bumps on my arm that you can see and feel. Within just a few days of using this lotion, the red bumps were gone. As long as I use it regularly, they stay gone. I also get little ingrown hairs around my knees from waxing/shaving, and this helps with that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this product is the smell. It says it is unscented, but that just means there is no added fragrance. The chemical smell is very powerful and off-putting. But the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Highly recommended for anyo e with \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot;. Using it daily and I notice a difference in how soft my arms feel</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it 5 stars. I was really hoping it would work for me and I was looking forward to using it daily but I tried it for about a little less than a week. For first use it was okay but after that I began to develop a rash on my medial and lateral part of my elbows. idk if something in it is to strong for my skin or if its an allergic reaction but I stopped using, it didn&#x27;t work for me. I have always suffered from sensitive skin so if i had KP I would still give it a try though might have better luck then me.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, scaly skin. I have also Keratosis Pilares (the red, bumpy skin that can occur on the backs of arms, legs, buttocks, etc. caused by clogging follicles, etc.) Most moisturizing lotions do little to nothing for KP. AmLactin, however, has done more to keep mine under control than anything else I have used. Using it on a regular basis has made my skin very soft and smooth...something that I have not experienced in years. The KP isn&#x27;t cured, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely. But it has become barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware, this lotion is strong. As the name (and ingredients) suggest, it uses lactic acid to help break down and rid the body of dead skin and bumps. If your skin is sensitive, test it on a small area first. And never use it where you have a rash or open cut. It will sting like hell. And it my experience, don&#x27;t use it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is acidic...not floral or manly, etc. But once it dries the smell is pretty much gone. It is also not a &#x27;thick&#x27; lotion...a little bit goes quite long way and spreads well across the skin.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist for small skin tags.  I have seen a noticable difference in my skin, less redness and a more even skin tone.</li>
    <li> The bottle indicated that this was unscented. It has the worst smell ever. I had to return it because I could not get past the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for two years and my ichtiosis vulgaris is much better now! Not a cure, but it helps noticeably.</li>
