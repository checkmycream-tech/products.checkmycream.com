      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>

      <li>I simply love it!</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>

      <li>Nice smell as is the norm with Hauschka body and face products.</li>
      <li>Better price, feels good on my skin and gives a nice Summer glow w/o it looking like foundation.</li>
      <li>Pros: Nice Alternative To Foundation; Lightweight WitH Good Coverage; Smooth Absorption</li>
      <li>it won&#x27;t rub off on your shirt collar very easily.</li>
      <li>This product is great in that it soaks in right away and unlike self tanners or bronzers</li>
      <li>I love it as I just use it together with my day creme.</li>
      <li>some of loreal, Maybelline  have much better scores.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>More of a GLOW.</li>
      <li>and I feel like it has better staying power than powder bronzer.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not a foundation and on lighter people you need to mix with a cream/foundation or tint to give your self a sun kissed look or to darken up said product for a better color match.</li>
      <li>a healthy bronzing glow</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite product from Hauschka.  </li>
      <li>Love this bronzer...</li>
      <li>None of the off-color I&#x27;ve seen with many self tanners, and keeps skin translucent looking.  </li>
      <li>I just really love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love Dr Hauschka&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>I really love using this product.</li>
      <li>Its just ok</li>
      <li>Much better than caky make-ups+powder layers...</li>
      <li>I like the day cream with tint better than this tho.</li>
      <li>When I searched out Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s bronzer, to my horror, it received a 7 (10 being the most toxic).</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>you are familiar with Dr. Hauschka, most of the ingredients are organic and biodynamically grown (google it) on their own farms.</li>
      <li>This, like MOST of the gel bronzers (WHY WHY WHY did Smashbox have to discontinue their gel bronzer???!!!), has a definite orange cast to it.  </li>
      <li>Great product, it doesn&#x27;t matter what skin tone you have, it will make your skin look better, I don&#x27;t like heavy makeups and it works great for me.</li>
      <li>A good hint of color and no need for foundation on these hot summer days</li>
      <li>I fell in love with how easy Dr. Hauschka was to apply.  </li>
      <li>I was really hoping that this product was as good as many of its reviews.</li>
      <li>Great product to mix with my foundation to make the shade darker, add in lotions, or use by itself to give my skin a natural bronze look.</li>
      <li>I love how light it is on my skin and what a non bronzer bronze it gives me.</li>
      <li>This is the best all-natural, eco-conscious, bronzer and it gives my skin a slightly tanned, healthy glow.  </li>
      <li>Can mix easily with your moisturizer.</li>
      <li>first time i&#x27;m writing review on something I don&#x27;t own.</li>
      <li>it gives me light coverage and an even skin tone.</li>
      <li>IT does not go on smoothly but leaves a film on the skin.</li>
      <li>Great sheer tint.  </li>
      <li>Helps smooth and soften skin, keeps it from drying in any season.</li>
      <li>It goes on super dark, but do not worry because as you rub it in it evens out perfectly.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>when applied, absorbed easily--</li>
      <li>Channel makes one thats similar but more shimmer and more glowy highlight though still in the light bronze</li>
      <li>Nice lotion with just enough tint and goes on light, smooth and even.  </li>
      <li>or if you&#x27;re new to face color mix it with moisturizer or sunscreen, though again this is a light and build able color.</li>
      <li>and when you get older you want your make up to be easy to put on and easy to wear.</li>
      <li>there are a lot of great  companies out there (like 100% pure, Mychelle, Gabrielle, ZUII, Inika etc) and their products not only a LOT safer but cheaper as well.</li>
      <li>I just mix a small amount with my foundation, gives my face a nice healthy glow!</li>
      <li>I think its really very wearable for anyone of any skin color or type-really easy, foolproof, just blend in with fingertips</li>
      <li>toxicity in your makeup is important to you, I&#x27;d suggest looking into each of your &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, I certainly am going to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rant</li>
      <li>I just put a little powder over the spot w some scarring and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>Great for everyday use on dark/deep skin tone</li>
      <li>Completely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Love Dr H and the natural ingredients this company uses.</li>
      <li>It looks a lot more natural.</li>
      <li>because of this it was worth the cost.</li>
      <li>It is pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>where I naturally get sun-and it looks great enough over sunscreen that I can skip foundation and just use eye concealer.</li>
      <li>It gives your face a natural glow and gives your face a healthy color.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for pale skinned ladies.  </li>
      <li>Moisturize first - then add this on top for a very natural glow.</li>
      <li>some of Dr. hauschka&#x27;s other products aren&#x27;t good either.</li>
      <li>It is just the right shade of shear color for that sun glow..</li>
      <li>so naturally my face is very pale and pigment is not the best.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, it doesn&#x27;t matter what skin tone you have, it will make your skin look better, I don&#x27;t like heavy makeups and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years</li>
    <li> My daughter said it turns her skin orange. She threw it away</li>
    <li> great product I have used it for years--I mix a very small amt of it with a dab of Trader Joes antioxidant facial serum &amp; use it instead of a make up foundation-I love it.  It makes my skin soft and gives it a healthy even light tint without the heavy made-up look that I find most cosmetics create. I am 64 yrs young and appreciate that.</li>
    <li> This, like MOST of the gel bronzers (WHY WHY WHY did Smashbox have to discontinue their gel bronzer???!!!), has a definite orange cast to it.  Why on earth do all these companies think we want to look orange? I don&#x27;t get it.  If you like a nice orange cast to your skin, the consistency of this is very nice.  Did I mention it&#x27;s orange?</li>
    <li> Great product to mix with my foundation to make the shade darker, add in lotions, or use by itself to give my skin a natural bronze look.</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon after trying it at my local co-op. Better price, feels good on my skin and gives a nice Summer glow w/o it looking like foundation.</li>
    <li> I like mixing this in with my moisturizer (hell, even sometimes on my legs during the summer. I&#x27;m pale!) You can definitely start little with this and build up as needed. I don&#x27;t feel any extra *stuff* on my face while wearing it and I feel like it has better staying power than powder bronzer. It also has that little extra *oomph* and makes me feel more luminous.</li>
    <li> I mix this with a little of my regular moisturizer/sunscreen.  It definitely takes off a little of my usual pastiness, but it doesn&#x27;t given you a tan when you don&#x27;t have one.  Still it&#x27;s enough for a little daily boost.  The product is a little pricey but seems like it&#x27;s going to last a long time.</li>
    <li> subtle yet brings the glow and feels amazing.  Its the way I like to care for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t crease or become caked.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I love it. Thank you for the fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> Amazing I do ad a bit of liquid.</li>
    <li> This is the best all-natural, eco-conscious, bronzer and it gives my skin a slightly tanned, healthy glow.  Have been using it for a few years now and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s similar to a suntan in a jar.  Goes on very smoothly, no orange or yellow colouring.  It immediately brightens up my face when I apply it every morning.  I purchased this product because of Amazon reviews.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for pasty arms! Moisturize first - then add this on top for a very natural glow.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product since 1996.  i love it because when i mix it with dr haushka&#x27;s day cream i use it as a combination moisturizer/makeup base everyday.  it gives me light coverage and an even skin tone. and when you get older you want your make up to be easy to put on and easy to wear.</li>
    <li> I mix this with moisturizer.  A little goes a very long way, and gives me a boost of color!</li>
    <li> Worth the expense, since such a little goes a long way and produces a very natural healthy color even when I&#x27;m pasty winter pale.  None of the off-color I&#x27;ve seen with many self tanners, and keeps skin translucent looking.  Helps to diminish the appearance of aging spots, although it does not cover them up.  No heavy feel when applied, absorbed easily-- I generally mix a drop with a couple of drops of Hauschka moisurizing oil, and it&#x27;s quite enough for my face and neck.  I use an extra drop to cheekbone areas for sculpting effect when I&#x27;m feeling fussy.</li>
    <li> first time i&#x27;m writing review on something I don&#x27;t own. just want to warn people who are trying to go toxic-free in their cosmetics.  there are a lot of great  companies out there (like 100% pure, Mychelle, Gabrielle, ZUII, Inika etc) and their products not only a LOT safer but cheaper as well. some of Dr. hauschka&#x27;s other products aren&#x27;t good either. for example, dr. hauschka&#x27;s translusent powder has talc as the first ingredient&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe this stuff is rated 7! some of loreal, Maybelline  have much better scores. what a disappointment. maijor greenwashing!</li>
    <li> It looks dark, but rub in all over your face after moisturizing.  It makes you look like you have a very slight, natural tan</li>
    <li> I love this product to get that little bit of extra color without using powder. I mix a little drop in with my tinted moisturizer to get a nice even distribution of color. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Gives you a perfect bronze shade at the beginning of summer when you need it most.  Try it-- you will not be displeased!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that this product was as good as many of its reviews. Unfortunately, its not. IT does not go on smoothly but leaves a film on the skin. It clogs my pores and sometimes looks blotchy. Its also sticky and flakes. Very inconsistent product.  I use it only if I plan on wearing a powder over it ...can&#x27;t wear this in the summer ...its too greasy... which works for the dry winter but not for the humid summers of NYC.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll like it for the winter since my skins gets dry in the cold.</li>
    <li> This works great on my neck and chest. But it makes my face break out. I am super sensitive.</li>
    <li> One bottle lasts me about a year. What&#x27;s great about this product is that you use only a few drops mixed in with your own favorite facial moisturizer. You can adjust the amount you use to get the color you want. I don&#x27;t use it daily, but only about once a week. It helps even out skin tones without making you look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great bronzer. Can mix easily with your moisturizer. I like the day cream with tint better than this tho.</li>
    <li> This bronzing concentrate is really concentrated...a little bit goes a long way.  This makes my skin radiate with extra beauty and glow.  Thank you Dr. Hauschka and Amazon.</li>
    <li> i have been using this bronzer for years--- it never fails to make me look healthy and glowing instead of pasty and tired</li>
    <li> Mixed up with your cream, it gives a nice tan that looks natural. I like to use it when it&#x27;s really hot and I don&#x27;t feel like using make-up.</li>
    <li> Pros: Nice Alternative To Foundation; Lightweight WitH Good Coverage; Smooth Absorption; A Little really does Goes A Long Way..  Con: Caused my super sensitive skin to break out repeatedly.  Once I stopped using the product, my face began to clear up.  Really disappointed because otherwise I would have given 5 stars :/</li>
    <li> It comes out with clumps which is a challenge to pick off your face. It seem like its old. Its just ok</li>
    <li> I love Dr Hauschka&#x27;s products. They are the very best quality I have used for my face. It is just the right shade of shear color for that sun glow..</li>
    <li> Little too dark for me but a great feel</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Completely worth the money. I mix a pump of this with a pump of Josie Maran&#x27;s foundation and two pumps of Josie Maran&#x27;s moisturizer every day. Gives me a completely natural glow. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Gives white skin a subtle blush of apparent &amp;#34;health&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for pale skinned ladies.  Gives me a pretty glow that can be adjusted to your liking.</li>
    <li> I really did not enjoy this.  It made my skin look orange &amp; was kind of chunky to apply.</li>
    <li> Love the color; love the ingredients, but not too crazy about the price. However, you get what you pay for and this bronzer is first rate. Moisturizes, yet adds a bit of color--but not too much.</li>
    <li> I chose this to add a little color to my face in place of tanning beds or sunless tanning lotion, i wanted a glow with the same effect but not glittery like so many cream and powder bronzers are. This is PERFECT, a lightweight consistency, scent is herbal I&#x27;d say and suggests natural ingredients though I haven&#x27;t read them yet. It was suggested to me to mix with my BB cream or tinted moisturizer but i prefer to blend it in after. its not an overly dark color, very sheer, adds a healthy glow and while not completely matte its no where near glittery or high shimmer. More of a GLOW. a healthy bronzing glow ive been seeking from 100 products for years and finally found here. because of this it was worth the cost. I can&#x27;t think of a dupe thats low cost. Channel makes one thats similar but more shimmer and more glowy highlight though still in the light bronze coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me its a little added moisture for my dry skin. I think its really very wearable for anyone of any skin color or type-really easy, foolproof, just blend in with fingertips or if you&#x27;re new to face color mix it with moisturizer or sunscreen, though again this is a light and build able color. I&#x27;m really fair and i can add a second layer blended into my cheeks, nose, forehead-where I naturally get sun-and it looks great enough over sunscreen that I can skip foundation and just use eye concealer. A new everyday staple for me I hope they don&#x27;t ever discontinue!!</li>
    <li> I just really love this stuff.  It enhances my natural skin color without appearing to be &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; it leaves my skin feeling fresh and dewy.  I simply love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a week now and I am hooked! I have stopped wearing my mineral powder to work. I just use this bronzing fluid after the dr. hauschka  normalizing day oil. It makes my skin look healthy and a little tan (I use a tanning bed for vitamin d and color but my face is never as dark as my body, this makes it match). It doesn&#x27;t cover old acne scars, but definitely evens out your skin tone. I just put a little powder over the spot w some scarring and my skin looks great. It is pricey, but worth it. A little goes a long way, it should last for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/12/2013: I still LOVE this product! I no longer use it on my whole face, but I put a couple squirts under my cheekbones and blend. I use this instead of bronzing powder. It looks a lot more natural. This is pretty much the only face makeup I use anymore and it looks great! My first bottle lasted a year, I just bought my second bottle. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Best liquid bronzer ever! The best thing about it is that it covers really well and that it has wonderful ingredients that are great for my skin!</li>
    <li> Great sheer tint.  I have only used it on my body as my face is really sensitive/prone to breakouts.  I usually mix it with my lotion to give a subtle glow/tan. Love Dr H and the natural ingredients this company uses.</li>
    <li> it is a bit too dark for my fair complexion, but I mix it with a SPF 50-60 sunscreen and I am good to go for the summer days!  A good hint of color and no need for foundation on these hot summer days</li>
    <li> Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products claim to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and healthier which is what introduced me to them in the first place... I literally had dumped all of my Sephora makeup and replaced it with makeup from Whole Foods.  I fell in love with how easy Dr. Hauschka was to apply.  However, I&#x27;m literally appalled right now.  My husband has been investigating all the toxic products in our home and introduced me to the Environmental Working Group website.  When I searched out Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s bronzer, to my horror, it received a 7 (10 being the most toxic). Please see for yourself: http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/517733/Dr.Hauschka_Skin_Care_Translucent_Bronze_Concentrate/ . Now if this were makeup that did not market itself to us natural minded folk, that would be one thing.  However, I feel lied to and disgusted and will be throwing my $30 bottle away as I&#x27;ve missed the return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If toxicity in your makeup is important to you, I&#x27;d suggest looking into each of your &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, I certainly am going to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rant over.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I love how light it is on my skin and what a non bronzer bronze it gives me. Looks totally natural.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday use on dark/deep skin tone (Gabrielle Union-esque). I use this when I look either: too red, too yellow or slightly greyish. Evens me out perfectly and you can still see my skin, it&#x27;s not a foundation and on lighter people you need to mix with a cream/foundation or tint to give your self a sun kissed look or to darken up said product for a better color match. It&#x27;s all natural and versatile.</li>
    <li> Not as translucent as I had hoped.  I am Latina and have a slight tan this was darker than my skin color and leaves splotches if not applied carefully. I&#x27;d mix this in with a moisturizer to lighten and apply evenly.  A bit disappointed with the product. Was expecting a more sheer effect.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will, which is rare for any product. I was looking for just a touch of natural color/glow as I am naturally very pale. I don&#x27;t want to look tanned necessarily, just a healthy glow and maybe a shade darker than normal. That is exactly what this provides. I have relatively dry skin, yet it is very sensitive and prone to break outs (from sensitivity, not acne) and was a little concerned that this product contains several oils. However, I have had absolutely no problems with breakouts or sensitivity since using this. It also soaks in very quickly and easily (I use a moisturizer underneath because my skin is dry, but if your skin is not naturally dry you probably don&#x27;t need a base).&lt;br /&gt;One thing I love about this product is that the color comes from Copper, not from the usual mineral cosmetic ingredients (while some are great for spf like titanium dioxide, using enough to give the complexion color usually makes skin look pasty and like a mask). This product is great in that it soaks in right away and unlike self tanners or bronzers it won&#x27;t rub off on your shirt collar very easily. It looks totally natural and not the least bit shiny or like you just put something on your skin.  I should also mention that the color is very buildable-you can reapply a second layer for more intense bronze color. Because of the copper, versus chemical self tanners, the color is completely deep brown, not orange in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;So why not 5 stars? A big reason I purchased this was because it was indicated to help cover minor blemishes and redness.  I have couperose skin and generally have redness around my nose and cheeks. I was hoping this product would \\&quot;blur\\&quot; the redness and cover it a bit, but it actually enhanced it. I was disappointed by that, but while the redness wasn&#x27;t necessarily erased my overall complexion is definitely evened out and more toned looking.&lt;br /&gt;If you are familiar with Dr. Hauschka, most of the ingredients are organic and biodynamically grown (google it) on their own farms. It is expensive, but it is the very highest quality, and I should note that a very small amount will cover the entire face, so it really does last a long time. This has minimal ingredients and no fillers-everything in it is beneficial to your skin.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I have terrible skin tone and will rarely go anywhere without makeup!!  Even just hanging around at home.  Not anymore!!  This product evens out imperfections and give a healthy glow to the worst of complexions.  My daughter commented on my &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34;, stating how good I looked.  When I told her I did not have a stitch of makeup on she asked, &amp;#34;What happened to your skin!!&amp;#34; She&#x27;s 29 so has known for years what I look like without makeup. Not good!!   She further commented that &amp;#34;Why would you wear makeup when you look like that without it!!&amp;#34;  I found about it when staying with my older sister far a visit.  Her skin looked amazingly radiant and dewy, at 62!!  I saw this product in her bathroom and thought  ah ha!!  I found her trick.  I ordered it and that was in December 02 2012.  I have been a constant and faithful user ever since the first time I tries it in 2012.  I would NEVER EVER allow myself to run out!!  I would be lost without it.</li>
    <li> I really love using this product. It makes my complexion smooth and is wonderful to use in the winter. It gives your face a natural glow and gives your face a healthy color. This and dr. Haushkas foundation is in my daily makeup routine.</li>
    <li> I use this instead of blush in the summer, and I also mix it with a moisturizing sunscreen to create a tinted sunscreen to use as foundation. This is my third or fourth bottle of the bronzer, which is something considering it lasts for years.</li>
    <li> This products works for all types of skins and tones. I don&#x27;t tan my face and if I want that perfect tan look I mixed this with a spf of my choice. If I want it little darker I apply another coat ... love this thing.</li>
    <li> I just mix a small amount with my foundation, gives my face a nice healthy glow! Like having a little summer tan all year.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love it as I just use it together with my day creme. The intensity of your bottle-tan is very well controllable by the amount you apply. Works very well for me as i love the natural look. Much better than caky make-ups+powder layers...</li>
    <li> allergic reaction, returned product.</li>
    <li> If its too red for you, add a little Dermablend Smooth Indulgence Concealer to balance out the color, that work well for me.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite product from Hauschka.  Hint of color, light weight coverage without looking fake or cake.  Helps smooth and soften skin, keeps it from drying in any season.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It works well with every face cream I have used.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion with just enough tint and goes on light, smooth and even.  Nice smell as is the norm with Hauschka body and face products.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product! Goes on evenly and never stains my hands. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and looks very natural! Love it!</li>
    <li> ALWAYS A GOOD product, DR. HAUSHKA rocks!</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer...I mix it with my moisturizer (more in the summer months when my skin is darker, less in the winter) and it adds just the right amount of color for a natural look!</li>
    <li> This is the best bronzer I have ever used!!! I use it everyday!!! You only need one small pump and it puts a very natural glow to my face. I would recommend this and have to all of my friends!! It is not greasy at all and does not wipe off after being applied. I do not tan my face at all so naturally my face is very pale and pigment is not the best. It goes on super dark, but do not worry because as you rub it in it evens out perfectly. I will it came in bigger bottles!</li>
    <li> BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS AND IT IS THE BEST BRONZER OUT THERE!!!!!  A MUST FOR EVERYONE WHO WANTS A NATURAL GLOW!!!!</li>
