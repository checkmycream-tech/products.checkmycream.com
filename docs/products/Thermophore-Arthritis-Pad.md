      <li>and i love it.</li>

      <li>The ones I originally purchased were wonderful and I recommended the product to many other satisfied customers.  </li>

      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It does heat up very quickly.  </li>
      <li>The size was fine, but it did not heat too well.  </li>
      <li>You can control the heat with the switch, and it heats up really quick!</li>
      <li>They are fantastic products, while they work.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>They are a fantastic company as well as a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>Dr. Kellog of Battle Creek was a genus and nothing to compare has ever been available.</li>
      <li>I understand the reasons such as safety and the on and off again heat bursts (which is very nice).  </li>
      <li>Caution this can get hot if held for more than about 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this neck pad.  </li>
      <li>and I have to readjust, but this is still such a good heating pad</li>
      <li>The design of the heating pad make it easy to drape it exactly where you need it.  </li>
      <li>But they do wear out quickly.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
      <li>Paragraph 3 cites &amp;#34;Failure to establish and maintain adequate procedures for receiving, reviewing and evaluating complaints, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(a)....</li>
      <li>They have sent me a new one, but I just have resorted to buying more.</li>
      <li>The velcro holds the pad on and it is relatively light weight and has a nice, long cord.  </li>
      <li>Six complaints, that were reportable events, found when you did not receive product back; you did not investigate the complaint.&amp;#34;  This kind of &amp;#34;deny all claims&amp;#34; behavior violates all known manufacturing Quality standards, and probably also Amazon Seller policies as well.  </li>
      <li>it does not get warm enough</li>
      <li>I carefully read many, many reviews of moist heat pads for the neck.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s worth manuevering around.  </li>
      <li>Just the right size for my neck area.  </li>
      <li>I love their product, the only problem I have is them going out too quickly.  </li>
      <li>To my surprise it arrived with a new advanced four-stage therapy switch which cycles through a 20-minute moist heat therapy session.  </li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable as opposed to buying it at a store.</li>
      <li>it heats up very fast and ii like the feature it has with the hold switch</li>
      <li>I have not used it very much.  </li>
      <li>my wife purchased the first Themophore and explained the concept of &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34; heat</li>
      <li>The first two stopped working within one year or so.</li>
      <li>A bit more expensive that most but better products are worth the extra $.</li>
      <li>needless to say it&#x27;s my new best friend...</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It produces an even heat that really loosens the muscles.  </li>
      <li>Also, the pad is too wide for the neck, it curls on the top and bottom</li>
      <li>I like it as much as the others I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
      <li>Frankly, the Thermophore generates heat so quickly in a few minutes, I prefer to be my own regulator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>During all this time, I still have the original largest one (covers your whole back) that I ordered, also from Battle Creek.</li>
      <li>It is what I expected, easy to use.</li>
      <li>A couple of good points, other than being too wide for the neck, it is constructed decent and works well.</li>
      <li>highly recommended this to anyone with neck&lt;</li>
      <li>For my neck,it gets really warm, so I need to let go of the trigger to let it cool down a little.</li>
      <li>I needed a new one and ordered the Classic Plus for my neck issues.  </li>
      <li>We have had the larger Thermophore since the early 1980&#x27;s and have convinced many of our friends to purchase one for their numerous aches and pains.</li>
      <li>This smaller one was purchased for a lower leg issue and has proved to be just the right size.</li>
      <li>This is rather inconvenient, as one cannot always keep a hand free to be gripping on this lever!</li>
      <li>Everything else about the heating pad is good, and worthy of a higher rating, but it is a bit frustrating that you must continually hold down the lever in order to get heat!</li>
      <li>Looks like Battle Creek, the new owner of Thermophore, just reboxed the unit without even adding the fleece cover and sent it out to me.  </li>
      <li>I returned one within the warranty period and got a new one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The heating pad does get hot and I like that, so a manual switch is necessary!</li>
      <li>I just slide it over the trigger and it holds down the lever keeping me hands free.  </li>
      <li>We are glad that we purchased the smaller one for specific issues as the larger one can be a bit much for smaller treatment areas.</li>
      <li>Also it arrived in just a couple of days - very prompt delivery and earlier than I even anticipated.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Contact Seller to find out HOW OLD item is before you</li>
      <li>THE OLD ONE DID NOT HAVE ANY NOISE.&lt;br</li>
      <li>In fact, their whole approach is to try to deny coverage from the outset by any means necessary.  </li>
      <li>I understand they designed it that way so that you can better control the heat, but what does it take to simply push the next button down?</li>
      <li>It is the only heating pad that I have found that gets hot enough to help with the pain from trigemina.  </li>
      <li>A simple on/off switch would have been better and/or with a few different heat settings.</li>
      <li>They are not fixing defective units anymore, but I called the company and found out they will take back defective products and let you buy new ones at a discount.</li>
      <li>After 1.5 years of easy use (my wife took it over as it does not get hot enough for me), it FAILED.  </li>
      <li>I would much prefer some other safety feature built in to a traditional on/off switch than this option.</li>
      <li>Heat control was the same as our older one, so that just was not the issue for us that other reviewers have noted.</li>

<li> I just wish I had ordered one just a little bit bigger but it still does the job.</li>
<li> This product came with a longer cord than I expected, so that I don&#x27;t need to use an extension cord.</li>
<li> They totally replace the the messy bags heated in a hydroculator.  </li>
<li> I settled on this one, knowing from reading the amazon description of the product that it would have a manual switch that I would have to hold down or put a rubber band around if I wanted to avoid constantly holding it down while reading, etc.  </li>
<li> Thermostat switch must be held down for it to heat, which takes a while.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works good. The cord could be a little longer.</li>
    <li> This is a great heating pad; it really gets HOT! Great for arthritis in neck and shoulders. A bit more expensive that most but better products are worth the extra $.</li>
    <li> Have not used this purchase as yet but have used the same model that I purchased some 20 years ago.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is velcroed so you can not have to worry about it falling off.  A couple of things I don&#x27;t like.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to constantly hold the control switch.  I understand they designed it that way so that you can better control the heat, but what does it take to simply push the next button down?, just my thought.  Also, the pad is too wide for the neck, it curls on the top and bottom and I can only assume that this is not good for the pad over time.  A couple of good points, other than being too wide for the neck, it is constructed decent and works well.</li>
    <li> There is a \\&quot;safety feature\\&quot; on this heating pad that was not mentioned: instead of an on/off switch with settings, there is a lever that needs to be continually held down in order for the heating pad to work. This is rather inconvenient, as one cannot always keep a hand free to be gripping on this lever! The product still works well besides this issue.</li>
    <li> it does not get warm enough</li>
    <li> Everything else about the heating pad is good, and worthy of a higher rating, but it is a bit frustrating that you must continually hold down the lever in order to get heat! I would much prefer some other safety feature built in to a traditional on/off switch than this option.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Lots of heat.Heats up quickly.Thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the \\&quot;trigger\\&quot; but like it. For my neck,it gets really warm, so I need to let go of the trigger to let it cool down a little.Always a moist heat.Great size to wrap around my neck.I would buy this product again.I would also buy from the same company again.Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this heating pad i was injured at work and the dr gave me this to use...needless to say it&#x27;s my new best friend...it is prefect treatment for my neck sprain</li>
    <li> I have used Thermaphore heating pads for 12 years.  The ones I originally purchased were wonderful and I recommended the product to many other satisfied customers.  I needed a new one and ordered the Classic Plus for my neck issues.  It arrived without the fleece cover as advertised.  Shockingly I found in the box a Return Authorization form from another customer who had apparently received and returned the same unit I had in my possession.  On the Return Authorization that customer had noted that the product arrived with no fleece cover.  Looks like Battle Creek, the new owner of Thermophore, just reboxed the unit without even adding the fleece cover and sent it out to me.  Needless to say, I am very unhappy with their service and will be returning the unit.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for my neck area.  This product came with a longer cord than I expected, so that I don&#x27;t need to use an extension cord.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of neck pain so thought this Moist Heat Pack would relieve it, and it does.  The heat temp. is superb, like no other heating pad I&#x27;ve owned.  The drawback is: the manual control that must be held down when in use is very annoying.  I understand the reasons such as safety and the on and off again heat bursts (which is very nice).  I think an additional control with auto shut off would be a nice added feature.  Thay way you have the best of both worlds, the burst of heat feature or the constant heat feature.  I&#x27;ve tied a twisty tie around my control when I want the constant heat application.  I can&#x27;t stand to lie there holding my hand on the control; that&#x27;s just silly.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I have used this product in the past. I recommend the middle size for the middle and lower back. This size works for the neck and shoulders as well. I use it also to wrap around my knee.</li>
    <li> I love their product, the only problem I have is them going out too quickly.  It is the only heating pad that I have found that gets hot enough to help with the pain from trigemina.  They have sent me a new one, but I just have resorted to buying more.</li>
    <li> Caution this can get hot if held for more than about 3 minutes. Works perfect for me. I like it.</li>
    <li> We have had the larger Thermophore since the early 1980&#x27;s and have convinced many of our friends to purchase one for their numerous aches and pains. This smaller one was purchased for a lower leg issue and has proved to be just the right size. It wrapped well around the problem area and the strap was effective in holding it in place. My wife has also used it for her neck and loves the size of this unit for that purpose. Heat control was the same as our older one, so that just was not the issue for us that other reviewers have noted. Frankly, the Thermophore generates heat so quickly in a few minutes, I prefer to be my own regulator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my wife purchased the first Themophore and explained the concept of &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34; heat, I thought that she needed it for her head. But, I used it and its been a part of the family medicine treatment plan ever since. We are glad that we purchased the smaller one for specific issues as the larger one can be a bit much for smaller treatment areas.</li>
    <li> I have not used it very much.  Thermostat switch must be held down for it to heat, which takes a while. Its awkward to hold it down  a switch while trying to position it properly. Also, the fleece pad to be  used to dampen and provide moist heat was not included in box. I have never had a heating pad that operates like this.</li>
    <li> Best heating pad there is.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after using it at my daughter&#x27;s home.  It helped me with a migraine headache. I liked the size and also that it automatically turns off if you fall asleep while using.</li>
    <li> The moist heat pack has performed as promised! Would recommend to any requiring moust heat applied to the neck, shoulder area. Manual switch most effective, I am able to control the temperature.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time to go and purchase the petite heating pad. The first two stopped working within one year or so. They are fantastic products, while they work. I like the little one for throwing in my suitcase and taking on trips with me. But they do wear out quickly. I returned one within the warranty period and got a new one. The second time I purchased one (so this would be my third), it stopped working again. During all this time, I still have the original largest one (covers your whole back) that I ordered, also from Battle Creek. So the big ones do last a lot longer.    _______________    UPDATE:    As a heads-up, these are smaller than they used to make. This petite version doesn&#x27;t even wrap all the way around my neck. And I&#x27;m not that big a person...I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8, 145 lbs. The fabric reaches around my neck, but the warming section (heat coils) do not.    They are not fixing defective units anymore, but I called the company and found out they will take back defective products and let you buy new ones at a discount. So I got the largest Thermophore from them for only $40 after returning my no-longer working one to them.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size to use for your neck. The velcro holds the pad on and it is relatively light weight and has a nice, long cord.  It produces an even heat that really loosens the muscles.  It heats to a nice temperature.  The only thing that I think needs a revamp is the switch.  I&#x27;m not too fond of a switch that I have to manually hold onto.  I worked my way around that though by rigging up an elastic band.  I just slide it over the trigger and it holds down the lever keeping me hands free.  Sometimes it slides off the lever and I have to readjust, but this is still such a good heating pad, it&#x27;s worth manuevering around.  A simple on/off switch would have been better and/or with a few different heat settings.</li>
    <li> This is my third Thermophore heating pad.  I like it as much as the others I&#x27;ve had.  I just wish I had ordered one just a little bit bigger but it still does the job.</li>
    <li> I have used a Thermophore moist heating pad for years and I LOVE IT!  Never had a problem and heating quality was exceptional.  So I thought I would buy the petite size for smaller areas to make it easier to use.  The size was fine, but it did not heat too well.  It might have been a defective unit - I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
    <li> Had one already just replacing it since I use it a lot due to neck and back problems. Works great!!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Easy to use.  Very effective.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one and it always works well--&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended this to anyone with neck&lt;br /&gt;or back pain!</li>
    <li> I have an older model and it works great!  You can control the heat with the switch, and it heats up really quick!</li>
    <li> My family have had Thermophores for over 30 years.  Dr. Kellog of Battle Creek was a genus and nothing to compare has ever been available. They totally replace the the messy bags heated in a hydroculator.  If you purchase one you&#x27;ll never be without one.</li>
    <li> As one reviewer stated, the WARRANTY does not start upon receipt of product.  It began when the item was made and stuff could be sitting in warehouses for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact Seller to find out HOW OLD item is before you buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, some companies do not put this item within a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company did, but I returned item because of arcing noises; little did I know that the newer ones have THIS noise.  THE OLD ONE DID NOT HAVE ANY NOISE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heating pad does get hot and I like that, so a manual switch is necessary!</li>
    <li> this is my third heating pad from thermophore and i love it. it heats up very fast and ii like the feature it has with the hold switch so if you fall asleep you will let off the heat.</li>
    <li> It does heat up very quickly.  It is great for my neck.  The price was very reasonable as opposed to buying it at a store.</li>
    <li> I carefully read many, many reviews of moist heat pads for the neck.  I settled on this one, knowing from reading the amazon description of the product that it would have a manual switch that I would have to hold down or put a rubber band around if I wanted to avoid constantly holding it down while reading, etc.  To my surprise it arrived with a new advanced four-stage therapy switch which cycles through a 20-minute moist heat therapy session.  You can turn the switch off at any time or press it again for another 20 minute round.  The switch makes no sound, so you do not wake or annoy a sleeping partner.  There is only one heat setting and it is as Goldilock&#x27;s discovered \\&quot;just right\\&quot;, not too hot and not too cold.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this neck pad.  Also it arrived in just a couple of days - very prompt delivery and earlier than I even anticipated. I&#x27;ve read the directions and am handling it with care.  Now I just hope it holds up.  I&#x27;ll write an update after a period of time concerning endurance. The box depiction on amazon.com is red, but my box was black and is labeled \\&quot;Thermophore Arthritis Pad\\&quot;  In looking at the instruction book, I see that it is only the \\&quot;arthritis\\&quot; pads that come in the black box while the red boxes have the automatic switch which means they have to be held down to provide heat.  If you want this 4-stage hands-free switch, you may want to indicate that on your order or call amazon to make that request.</li>
    <li> They are a fantastic company as well as a fantastic product.  I could not survive my migraines with out this product!</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  After 1.5 years of easy use (my wife took it over as it does not get hot enough for me), it FAILED.  As in quit.  As in D.O.A.  I contacted Battle Creek for a warranty replacement under the two year warranty, and I got ALL BATTLE and no Warranty.  In fact, their whole approach is to try to deny coverage from the outset by any means necessary.  The FDA has already sent them a Warning Letter on April 3, 2015 about this topic.    Here is an excerpt from a recent FDA Warning letter addressed to your company&#x27;s President, David Underhill, on April 3, 2015.  Paragraph 3 cites &amp;#34;Failure to establish and maintain adequate procedures for receiving, reviewing and evaluating complaints, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(a)....Your firm does not investigate complaints if product is not returned. Six complaints, that were reportable events, found when you did not receive product back; you did not investigate the complaint.&amp;#34;  This kind of &amp;#34;deny all claims&amp;#34; behavior violates all known manufacturing Quality standards, and probably also Amazon Seller policies as well.  Some would call it warranty fraud.</li>
    <li> Great!. It is what I expected, easy to use. Average rating because the strap separated after a few uses.Had to reattach it with needle and thread since I no not possess a sewing machine.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Description was on target.  Use it a few times a week and have not had any problems.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of moist heat for years.  Love it.  Hard to find but always at Amazon.</li>
    <li> The design of the heating pad make it easy to drape it exactly where you need it.  The switch for turning the heat on self releases if you fall asleep with it on.</li>
