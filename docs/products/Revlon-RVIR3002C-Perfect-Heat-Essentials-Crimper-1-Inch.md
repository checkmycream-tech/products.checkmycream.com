      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>Lol, but it would be great for an 80s look as well.</li>
      <li>The great thing about this crimper is you don&#x27;t have to use it at</li>
      <li>I am very happy that I decided to buy it, I love the way my hair looks.</li>
      <li>So when using this, make sure to take your time, figure out which heat setting works best for you</li>

      <li>Good product.</li>

      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a crimping iron, and I am very impressed.</li>

      <li>She loves this one, does a great job and keeps hot like it should.  </li>
      <li>(I went higher than it suggested for fine hair, setting it at 15 instead of 5), and give your hair a good squeeze!</li>
      <li>Since I use this to make my fine hair look thicker, the crimps are a nice size for me.</li>
      <li>love it love it</li>
      <li>love it and it is a life saver for me .</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t crimp the top layer of hair</li>
      <li>I think I will mostly use the crimper to get volume rather than doing all of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this crimper, I use it to crimp my roots so that my hair would have more volume.</li>
      <li>I think I was looking for a more spaced out wave.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more defined crimps with  smoother texture.</li>
      <li>It really does give volume to roots in a great way.  </li>
      <li>So I wanted DJ Tanner hair and this product did crimp my hair, but it gave it more texture than I wanted.</li>
      <li>I love my crimper.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this crimper with the thought that it will give my hair more volume.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it on occasion.</li>
      <li>I would recommend you get a better quality one.</li>
      <li>Okay, I probably can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this crimper for my sister, who was 12 at the time.</li>
      <li>It gets reasonably hot, and was fairly priced.</li>
      <li>This crimper works fine, and my daughter is reasonably satisfied with performance.  </li>
      <li>Now all I have to do is crimp 5 seconds at the crown and lightly tease to achieve even greater results.</li>
      <li>The package arrived very quickly though.</li>
      <li>So easy and lasts until you wash your hair.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, product is working fine.</li>
      <li>SHE HAS FINE HAIR</li>
      <li>It is what I expected for, happy with the product :)</li>
      <li>and I am happy to confirm that this product totally delivered!</li>
      <li>it works great especially on shorter hair.  </li>
      <li>My daughter started crimping the under layers of her hair for extra volume with her Revlon Crimper and got great results.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be cheap.</li>
      <li>Great solution for people has the same problems!</li>
      <li>it does stay in all day at school which is pretty cool!!</li>
      <li>The reason I gave it four stars instead of five though was mostly because you gotta crimp your hair just right.</li>
      <li>My hair is usually flat, but when i crimped it at the rutes, it gave me amazing volume.!</li>
      <li>It has a good variable temperature and a tiny crimp.</li>
      <li>It gives a very unique look to the hair, yes the crimper gives little crimps but they look good.  </li>
      <li>It did heat up quickly and gave me a ton of volume.</li>
      <li>quick shipping...</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly</li>
      <li>I bought this crimper in replace of a cheap set (which I posted the link so your aware not to buy this one....)</li>
      <li>Everything takes a bit of experimentation, sure, but I was very upset at first because it seemed like all I was getting was uncharacteristically frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine straight hair</li>
      <li>This makes very tiny krimps, so if you want the loser kind, this is not for you.</li>
      <li>So all in all, it&#x27;s all right</li>
      <li>I use this for costumes, so the quality is just right, and the price is even &amp;#34;right-er&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I have short hair, so this works perfectly to give me that little krimping I want.</li>
      <li>i bought it for fun , and it works good, heat up very fast and can make little curves on my hair.</li>
      <li>, delivery was super fast, and it wasnt even express delivery.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>just do  crimps at the hair root-I can get as much texture as I wanted!</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t the look I was going for, but if you&#x27;re interested in giving your hair more volume, this will definitely do the trick.     </li>
      <li>The recipient used it and said it worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>and it does get quite hot.</li>
      <li>It does what it is supposed to, turning her straight hair into a crimpy bush!</li>
      <li>This crimper is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I am positive</li>
      <li>Works great love the way it crimps my hair especially when u have thin hair</li>
      <li>This product can creates big volume in just minutes and easy to use.</li>
      <li>but when I do it is to go for an edgier look by crimping certain sections.</li>
      <li>but I see it&#x27;s TWICE as much now.</li>
      <li>Yes, the crimper is only 1\\&quot; but the effect that it has it fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It heats up fast.</li>
      <li>It crimped very well and heated up fast.</li>
      <li>Heats up fast too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s crimped really.</li>
      <li>It was time consuming and really damaging because when it came time to untangle my rats nest</li>
      <li>i would give the product 5 stars for amount of time the crimp stays in and for how fast it heats up (under a minute).  </li>
      <li>and it really works...</li>
      <li>I really like this product and what it does.  </li>
      <li>Pros: Doesn&#x27;t need product to hold a near-invincible crimp, heats up fast  Cons:</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it everyday, but it was worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>My hair feels kind of crunchy and dead when I use it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I snapped lots of hair in half.</li>
      <li>By crimping your hair (at the roots only) under the top layer, you can get big hair and that&#x27;s what I want!  </li>
      <li>I mean I love it very much...</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t squeeze tight enough or have the heat on high enough, you won&#x27;t get a good crimp at all.</li>
      <li>Received this product in record time right before the holidays...a little tricky to get the hair to look just right, I guess we&#x27;ll just keep practicing.  </li>
      <li>Wow!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This makes very tiny krimps, so if you want the loser kind, this is not for you. I have short hair, so this works perfectly to give me that little krimping I want. You can still do a LOT of kimping or just a little.  I get so many compliments!</li>
    <li> crimps are too small.  Doesn&#x27;t look like I crimped my hair.....looks like I just got a bad perm!  Yuck.  Do not buy it if you are looking for big flirty crimps!!</li>
    <li> I got it for my neice for xmas, got here just in time and she LOVES it!</li>
    <li> Pros: Doesn&#x27;t need product to hold a near-invincible crimp, heats up fast  Cons: If you rush while using it, you get textured and frizzy instead of crimp    Wow! This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a crimping iron, and I am very impressed. I have tried curling my hair multiple times, and my hair never holds it. Even with loads of product, my curls would flatten out within a few hours. Definitely not the case with this though! Not a bit of product in my hair, and once I&#x27;d figured out how to get it to crimp well there was no getting rid of it. I left in it for a couple of hours before deciding I wanted to flatten it out and try a different style-- The straightening iron had no effect! It was amazing, though a bit frustrating. I have since taken a shower and my hair seems to be back to normal.    The volume this provides is so crazy. I crimped the bottom layer of my hair and I have never seen it so poofy! It felt very thick, the crimps were well-defined, and I didn&#x27;t even bother with the top layer because my hair was thick enough as it was. It wasn&#x27;t the look I was going for, but if you&#x27;re interested in giving your hair more volume, this will definitely do the trick.     The reason I gave it four stars instead of five though was mostly because you gotta crimp your hair just right. If you don&#x27;t squeeze tight enough or have the heat on high enough, you won&#x27;t get a good crimp at all. Everything takes a bit of experimentation, sure, but I was very upset at first because it seemed like all I was getting was uncharacteristically frizzy hair. So when using this, make sure to take your time, figure out which heat setting works best for you (I went higher than it suggested for fine hair, setting it at 15 instead of 5), and give your hair a good squeeze!</li>
    <li> As others stated, it creates very small crimps...so if you are looking for a noticeable big crimps wave, then this is not for you.     I like to use it on the inner layers of my hair to create a little volume for my straight black hair.</li>
    <li> I just got my crimper today and tried it out.  I guess I didn&#x27;t realize how long it takes to crimp!  The way I&#x27;ve done it previously is put my hair in a bunch of french braids before bed and undo them in the morning.  I spent over an hour crimping and although my hair reaches about a third of the way down my back, it&#x27;s pretty thin so it took longer than I expected.  It did heat up quickly and gave me a ton of volume. It looks like frizz rather than crimps because the crimps are so small, but I like it-my hair looks really thick!  I think I will mostly use the crimper to get volume rather than doing all of my hair.  By crimping your hair (at the roots only) under the top layer, you can get big hair and that&#x27;s what I want!  So all in all, it&#x27;s all right and I don&#x27;t think it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I remember buying a crimper during the 1980&#x27;s and I loved the style!  The crimper heats up within seconds. And the type of styling is done within minutes.  I would suggest buying this product to any of my family and friends!</li>
    <li> Since I use this to make my fine hair look thicker, the crimps are a nice size for me. Sometimes people even ask me if I&#x27;m mixed with African American when I wear it crimped. However sometimes when I use it my hair gets snagged between the metal and black part and I lose a couple of strands. I cannot afford to lose any hair! I paid only $12.99 for mine about 6 months ago but I see it&#x27;s TWICE as much now. So for my price, I guess I got what I paid for. I would recommend you get a better quality one. Don&#x27;t be cheap.</li>
    <li> This crimper is absolutely perfect. It has a good variable temperature and a tiny crimp. Just right to give my hair a little body without the crimped hair being noticeable. love it love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this crimper with the thought that it will give my hair more volume.  I saw it somewhere that the crimper will create volume when the roots of the hair are crimped. I have used it a couple of times since I got it.  It did not give consistent result, some place I need to clip a few times to get waves, some place it almost burnt my hair!  Also the waves do not hold for a long time.  All in all, this is a disappointed purchase.  It definitely did not give me the volume I want.</li>
    <li> So I wanted DJ Tanner hair and this product did crimp my hair, but it gave it more texture than I wanted.</li>
    <li> i bought it for fun , and it works good, heat up very fast and can make little curves on my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this. It does what it is supposed to, turning her straight hair into a crimpy bush! She loves to play with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it! I got it trough Amazon, ordered it on wednesday and got it on friday, delivery was super fast, and it wasnt even express delivery. It heats up fast. My hair is usually flat, but when i crimped it at the rutes, it gave me amazing volume.! I would totally recommend for someone who wants volume.</li>
    <li> I bought this crimper in replace of a cheap set (which I posted the link so your aware not to buy this one....) [[ASIN:B00006FDU6 Conair 3-in-1 Style Set (Color May Vary)]]I bought for my duaghter which didn&#x27;t work.  She loves this one, does a great job and keeps hot like it should.  Just so you know, this crimper has the smaller plate and tighter crimp.  So if your looking for the old 80/90&#x27;s style wide crimp this is NOT the one.  It works great and I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 7 yr old daughter she likes to crimp her hair. I got this and it just makes her hair look crazy. it does stay in all day at school which is pretty cool!! I just wish I would of went with the bigger cramping bars. so it didn&#x27;t look so crazy!!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this to recreate the 80s look today, it really just makes your hair get really frizzy and not cute and its not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This crimper is exactly what I wanted. I wanted something with very tiny crimps to crimp at the root. I am positive the people who don&#x27;t like this crimper aren&#x27;t using it correctly, no offence, some people just don&#x27;t know. You crimp at the root but you don&#x27;t crimp the top layer of hair so you can brush and spray that layer over the crimps. The crimps are then, hidden. Lol, but it would be great for an 80s look as well. I have seen some stylists crimp teeny tiny pieces for some texture and an edgier look. The great thing about this crimper is you don&#x27;t have to use it at it&#x27;s hottest, there is a temperature control. Personally, I like to use it at it&#x27;s hottest and it does get quite hot.</li>
    <li> it works great especially on shorter hair.  be prepared though because the crimps are tiny...they will give you a lot of volume</li>
    <li> This crimper is good for whoever want to have volume hair, like the other comments, it&#x27;s the best for the root cause they&#x27;re really tiny crimps. It is what I expected for, happy with the product :)</li>
    <li> I have really flat hair. I&#x27;ve tried many products to increase the volume of my hair and it was never successful. I discovered with this iron- just do  crimps at the hair root-I can get as much texture as I wanted! fast and simple. Great solution for people has the same problems!</li>
    <li> This was a holiday gift for a young girl.  The recipient used it and said it worked pretty well.It was a little thinner than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> the crimping iron does work as promised, but the crimps are so tiny that my hair just ends up looking frizzy unless i put a ton of styling products into it first and then flip the ends up with my wide barrel curling iron post-crimping.  i would give the product 5 stars for amount of time the crimp stays in and for how fast it heats up (under a minute).  i would give the product 0 stars for making my hair look fancy, crimped, and 1984-fabulous.  i need to find a wider crimping iron.  anyone out there want to make a trade?</li>
    <li> I love this crimper, I use it to crimp my roots so that my hair would have more volume. I was planning to get another one for my friend but I was surprised that the price has change drastically. I bought this in 2011 for $14, and now it&#x27;s 26.99??</li>
    <li> I really like this product and what it does.  It gives a very unique look to the hair, yes the crimper gives little crimps but they look good.  It really does give volume to roots in a great way.  I am very happy that I decided to buy it, I love the way my hair looks.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS CRIMPER FOR MY DAUGHTER.  SHE HAS FINE HAIR AND SHE USES IT ON OCCASIONS. IT MAKES SMALL CRIMPS.  I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT SMALL CRIMPS IN THEIR HAIR.  I PREFER LARGER.</li>
    <li> This crimper works fine, and my daughter is reasonably satisfied with performance.  However, next time we would purchase wider one.  It takes very long to crimp your hair with the one inch width.  Recommend wider model.  Otherwise, product is working fine.</li>
    <li> This product can creates big volume in just minutes and easy to use. I&#x27;m amazed by the result it delivers.</li>
    <li> Loved the crimper for volume! used it for a month or two before the plastic around the crimping plates melted whenever I turned it on. it smoked and smelt awful.&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t return it anymore either :(</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a crimper for a long time in the stores with no success.  I decided to look on line and found what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would have liked. The crimps in the hair aren&#x27;t very deep. I don&#x27;t use it that often but when I do it is to go for an edgier look by crimping certain sections. You can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s crimped really. The hair looks just kind of frizzy.</li>
    <li> This crimper makes very small crimps and adds lots of volume!  Heats up fast too.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to crimp at the roots to add volume.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for. My hair feels kind of crunchy and dead when I use it. I think I was looking for a more spaced out wave. It does help to add volume if I want to do the snookie bump. But other then that it doesn&#x27;t do much for me. The package arrived very quickly though.</li>
    <li> Received this product in record time right before the holidays...a little tricky to get the hair to look just right, I guess we&#x27;ll just keep practicing.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I love my crimper.  I have fine straight hair and this is the perfect solution to add body.  Just crimp at the roots!</li>
    <li> Takes me back to the 80&#x27;s! I haven&#x27;t been able to use it everyday, but it was worth the purchase. Thank you for providing a quality product.</li>
    <li> Not well made. Felt like it would fall apart in my hand.</li>
    <li> love it and it is a life saver for me . I have very thin hair and this helps me with fullness. will order again</li>
    <li> I did not like it at all.  I only used twice because it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to crimp.  I would return it for refund if I could</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t be the only one who thinks of Snoop Dogg when they hear the word \\&quot;crimp\\&quot;! Okay, I probably can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this crimper for my sister, who was 12 at the time. Her hair crimps like a boss with this thing. It gets reasonably hot, and was fairly priced. Go getchu one.</li>
    <li> I use this for costumes, so the quality is just right, and the price is even &amp;#34;right-er&amp;#34;.  Arrived quickly and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it on occasion.</li>
    <li> I saw an infomercial late one night selling a root crimper/booster that was really expensive. I did my research and found this gem. I hoped and prayed it would give me the same results and I am happy to confirm that this product totally delivered! Prior to this product I has to tease the snot out of my limp, fine, uncooperative hair just to achieve some volume. It was time consuming and really damaging because when it came time to untangle my rats nest I&#x27;m sure I snapped lots of hair in half. Now all I have to do is crimp 5 seconds at the crown and lightly tease to achieve even greater results. This crimper has cut down the time it takes to do my hair and I believe it has greatly reduced the amount of damage I inflict to my hair. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this crimper!</li>
    <li> I like it very much.I mean I love it very much...quick shipping...and it really works...thank you....I still think it will ruin your hair..so don&#x27;t use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Yes, the crimper is only 1\\&quot; but the effect that it has it fantastic.  It really gets hot enough to do the job, and the crimped texture can last for days.</li>
    <li> It crimped very well and heated up fast. You dont have to hold for very long to crimp depending on the amount you want. Its a good product. I have no complaints. I only used very occasionally but i had for years with no problem</li>
    <li> This crimper offers very small crimps, not at all like traditional crimpers. Good if you only want to crimp small sections at a time, but even then, the crimps are not very neat looking.</li>
    <li> This crimper must be used on small sections of hair.  Takes too long and comes out frizzy if you want that look.  I was hoping for more defined crimps with  smoother texture.</li>
    <li> Works great love the way it crimps my hair especially when u have thin hair u get loads of volume</li>
    <li> My daughter started crimping the under layers of her hair for extra volume with her Revlon Crimper and got great results.  She taught me how to do it and I loved the look.  So easy and lasts until you wash your hair.  She went off to college....and took her crimper!  Now I have my own, thankfully.</li>
