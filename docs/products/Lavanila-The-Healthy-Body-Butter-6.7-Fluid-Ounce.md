      <li>My skin has never felt better.</li>
      <li>Great quality &amp; the smell is subtle but wonderful!</li>
      <li>/&gt;-It had a very unique, warm baked brown sugary, vanilla with a hint of baby powder aroma which I find just perfect (and I am not necessarily a huge vanilla lotion fan).&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fell in love with the smooth and comforting scent of this product.</li>

      <li>If you can tolerate smelling like a bingo parlor full of elderly Avon ladies.</li>
      <li>My new love.</li>
      <li>This is the first ipsy sample I had to rush out and buy!</li>

      <li>I was extremely surprised at how lovely it smells.</li>
      <li>I have used and loved a similar product in their baby line that actually smelled more like vanilla.</li>
      <li>It smells nothing like old ladies and yet isn&#x27;t an overpowering food smell which I find most vanilla scents</li>
      <li>smells like fresh baked goodies).</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this lotion while it&#x27;s a little price I find myself did buying it because of its unique refreshing smell.</li>
      <li>This one has just the right amount of aroma to make you smell yummy, but not nauseating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have an eternal quest to find the best hand lotion for my grungy, always dry and rough hands.  </li>
      <li>I am 34 years old and do not care for floral or super perfumy skin care products.</li>
      <li>It feels like it is really hydrating and locking in moisture when I put it</li>
      <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s in their somewhere, but there is an overpowering overtone that&#x27;s more like baby powder mixed with old lady perfume.</li>
      <li>Definitely ordering and definitely found a new favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>It is super moisturizing and blows all my other hand lotions out of the water.</li>
      <li>I wish they sold it in a humongous vat, because I would seriously just bathe in this stuff :)</li>
      <li>I got a small bottle of this (only .85 oz) in my Ipsy subscription box and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to scents as I can easily get a migraine and become heavily nauseated.</li>

<li> don&#x27;t know what the other reviewer was talking about how you&#x27;d smell like a bunch of old ladies wearing Avon at a bingo parlor.....</li>
<li> First, it&#x27;s not quite thick enough to count as a butter for me.</li>
<li> however I will continue buying this product as long as it is sold and remains unchanged.</li>
<li> Actively looked for it when it was out of production.</li>
<li> I actually had to be drunk to order it since it is relatively expensive but it is so worth having!</li>
<li> It is a little pricy for me</li>
<li> I received a small sample of this lotion in an Itsy bag.</li>
<li> Second, this smell is wrong.</li>
<li> lotion is very thick, but not greasy.</li>

    <li> I am very sensitive to scents as I can easily get a migraine and become heavily nauseated. When I received a sample I almost gave it away since I wear non scented lotions. I was extremely surprised at how lovely it smells. It smells nothing like old ladies and yet isn&#x27;t an overpowering food smell which I find most vanilla scents have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it is very smooth and hydrating. It isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs wonderfully so you don&#x27;t have any worries about leaving residue on anything you touch after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received many complaints and I find it soothing. It is now my number one favorite lotion and scent. It is a little pricy for me however I will continue buying this product as long as it is sold and remains unchanged. Occasionally, I find myself in a battle to either where this lotion or my J&#x27;adore Dior perfume.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness this smells so good fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion while it&#x27;s a little price I find myself did buying it because of its unique refreshing smell. Everytime I wear it I get nothing but compliments.</li>
    <li> I have an eternal quest to find the best hand lotion for my grungy, always dry and rough hands.  This needs more vanilla scent. Not that enthralled. . .</li>
    <li> Smells so good and is super hydrating!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, feels nice on my skin.  Love it</li>
    <li> I also received this in my ipsy bag and absolutely loved it! As soon as the sample was gone I was searching to order...I actually get compliments on the scent and they def are NOT from elderly Avon ladies!! :)</li>
    <li> This lotion is incredible. My skin has never been softer and it smells AMAZING. I get so many compliments just from this lotion alone. I wish they sold it in a humongous vat, because I would seriously just bathe in this stuff :)</li>
    <li> I received a small sample of this lotion in an Itsy bag. The fragrance is very nice. I found it on the Amazon site and purchased.</li>
    <li> My new love. &amp;#60;3 Smells euphoric and is non-greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the first ipsy sample I had to rush out and buy! I love the scent every time I use it I get compliments on it!</li>
    <li> Love,love,love this product. Actively looked for it when it was out of production. I always get compliments on &amp;#34;my perfume&amp;#34; or someone asks &amp;#34;who is baking cookies&amp;#34;.(It smells like fresh baked goodies). PLEASE DON&#x27;T TAKE MY PURE VANILLA AWAY AGAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> I got a small bottle of this (only .85 oz) in my Ipsy subscription box and fell in love with it. The smell is beautiful. Not too overpowering and not food like. It is super moisturizing and blows all my other hand lotions out of the water. Definitely ordering and definitely found a new favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> Received this product initially as a sample from Ipsy. Fell in love with the smooth and comforting scent of this product. My skin has never felt better. I apply before bed and the scent is soothing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Great quality &amp; the smell is subtle but wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love it!! smells so good!!</li>
    <li> Thank you for a great product and transaction</li>
    <li> My favorite! It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy like some lotions do.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this and had to purchase it. I actually had to be drunk to order it since it is relatively expensive but it is so worth having! It is so smooth and it smells so nice. I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> Got a trial size of this from ipsy. After using it, I bought two of the regular sizes of this. Love the warm vanilla - brown sugar scent.  This will be a fave for years to come... and Christmas too!</li>
    <li> Feels and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product otherwise. If you can tolerate smelling like a bingo parlor full of elderly Avon ladies.</li>
    <li> After a little hiccup with the seller (That was fixed immediately - excellent customer service!) I received my product. This stuff is AMAZING. My skin is so soft and this lotion has an excellent, yummy sent without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> No, no, no. First, it&#x27;s not quite thick enough to count as a butter for me. Second, this smell is wrong. I have used and loved a similar product in their baby line that actually smelled more like vanilla. This is not vanilla. Perhaps it&#x27;s in their somewhere, but there is an overpowering overtone that&#x27;s more like baby powder mixed with old lady perfume. I will not be finishing this tube.</li>
