      <li>Great price and fairly quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE Rose by Paul Smith.</li>
      <li>It is a very mild rose perfume that give you a warm feeling.</li>
      <li>This perfume lacks the powdery smell that most rose perfumes have, and I&#x27;m so glad for that.</li>
      <li>I guess everyone has their interpretation of &amp;#34;rose scented&amp;#34; is suppose to smell like, for me, this perfume&#x27;s rose scent isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance</li>

      <li>Both me and hubbie love it.</li>
      <li>love this</li>
      <li>It was a much better price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Lovely and flowery, sweet.  Still love it!</li>
      <li>I like the smell the fresh cut rose.</li>
      <li>But this is very light and with lovely fresh floral scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The perfume is light and elegant, not the pungent and sickly sweet that many &amp;#34;English Rose&amp;#34; scented sprays boast.  </li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews, but I received this today, and tried it on immediately, because I love Paul Smith&#x27;s florals..</li>
      <li>This was a great purchase especially considering the price.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful rose scent that is not too heavy or intense.</li>
      <li>My new Favorite!</li>
      <li>I purchased a smaller bottle of Paul Smith Rose perfume in 2011 and fell in love.  </li>
      <li>its like smelling a natural rose all the time.</li>
      <li>Nice, soft scent...</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
      <li>I gained many compliments wearing it and it lasts for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy it again.</li>
      <li>It does not linger strongly, so if you are looking for a bold rose scent that has a wide radius, this is not for you.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this perfume to anyone who loves rose perfumes, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>It smells just like fresh cut roses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If your wife want a perfume that smells like fresh cut roses.....</li>
      <li>If you like the fragrance of roses then this perfume will be right for you.</li>
      <li>It is all about the smell...and this is just right.</li>
      <li>It arrived on time and is the exact product.</li>
      <li>This is definitely one of the most affordable quality perfumes I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
      <li>Pretty packaging.</li>
      <li>if u love roses, ill love this perfume!</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>So, you need to chose the seller more carefully.</li>
      <li>Not quite as much staying power as I&#x27;d like but still my all time fav.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Very elegant, feminine and long lasting.</li>
      <li>The pure rose smell is delicate, but not faint.</li>
      <li>I used it sparingly, worried that I would not be able to find it again, but was delighted to find it on Amazon, and a larger bottle for the same price that I paid for the small bottle while abroad.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought the same over five times, and I am familiar with the perfume&#x27;s smell.</li>
      <li>The only thing I wish is that it would last a little bit longer would love if it were more concentrated</li>
      <li>Similar to Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s English Rose, but more complex.</li>
      <li>I have a really sensitive nose, most EDP really bothers me and makes me feel nauseated.</li>
      <li>I have bought this perfume for my mother-in-law on several occasions and she absolutely adores it.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Scent lasts all day long and you don&#x27;t need that much.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s undermining the vague rose scent that is there.</li>
      <li>The larger bottle is for the confident... and for those of us who are fearful that we won&#x27;t be able to find it in the future.</li>

    <li> It smells just like fresh cut roses.&lt;br /&gt;I love this and I wear this every day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************************&lt;br /&gt;Just to let people know...&lt;br /&gt;As it says under my name, I wrote this review for \\&quot; Paul Smith Rose\\&quot;, instead of \\&quot;Paul Smith for Women\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;They are 2 different products. I have no idea why Amazon is putting those 2 together.</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume, I love it. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased a smaller bottle of Paul Smith Rose perfume in 2011 and fell in love.

It does not linger strongly, so if you are looking for a bold rose scent that has a wide radius, this is not for you.  This is more of a &amp;#34;hug scent&amp;#34; (a pleasant surprise for those already blessed with a hug from you!).  In that way, it does linger throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller bottle is easier on the hand for application, and perfect for someone exploring to find their signature.  The larger bottle is for the confident... and for those of us who are fearful that we won&#x27;t be able to find it in the future.</li>
    <li> Best rose floral fragrance ever! Similar to Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s English Rose, but more complex. Very elegant, feminine and long lasting. My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> My signature scent...originally purchased at Selfridge&#x27;s, London.  Great price and fairly quick delivery.  Scent lasts all day long and you don&#x27;t need that much.  Lovely and flowery, sweet.  Still love it!</li>
    <li> i dont have it is a real Paul Smith Rosa because the smell is different and weird. I bought the same over five times, and I am familiar with the perfume&#x27;s smell. So, you need to chose the seller more carefully.</li>

    <li> This was a great purchase especially considering the price. This perfume has definitely made it way to the number 1 used perfume in my collection. This is a wonderful rose scent that is not too heavy or intense. The only thing I wish is that it would last a little bit longer would love if it were more concentrated but besides that very very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I get a lot of complements on this perfume.</li>
    <li> Nice light scent. Pretty packaging. Hope to get lots of compliments. I use parfum daily, and like a parfum that is not real heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
    <li> Best purchase I have ever bought for my wife. If your wife want a perfume that smells like fresh cut roses.....This is it... A+++ and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I guess everyone has their interpretation of &amp;#34;rose scented&amp;#34; is suppose to smell like, for me, this perfume&#x27;s rose scent isn&#x27;t that strong. But some other scent is. I can&#x27;t place the scent but it&#x27;s pretty strong and it&#x27;s undermining the vague rose scent that is there.</li>
    <li> Love this product and do sad is discontinued</li>
    <li> I bought this based on people&#x27;s reviews only. I was pleasantly surprised. It does smell like roses and I like it a lot.</li>

Presaging the spring, this is a timeless and absolutely feminine rose EDP, smelling absolutely delicious on my skin! And it was cheaper on Amazon than on other sites. Cant beat this one if you like florals. And it came in a beautiful old-fashioned rose-printed cloth bag..Best spring purchase!</li>
    <li> Both me and hubbie love it. Very elegant and feminine rose fragrance. Just got it in mail today. 100 ml for 37 is a steal.</li>
    <li> I saw this perfume while visiting my family in England. It was a much better price on Amazon. I love the fragrance and I wear it in the daytime for work.If you like the fragrance of roses then this perfume will be right for you. I would purchase this again and especially if it is fulfilled by Amazon as I find them to be trustworthy source for fragrance.</li>
    <li> My personal scent! Not quite as much staying power as I&#x27;d like but still my all time fav.</li>

    <li> Love it smell!! And beautiful package~~</li>
    <li> arrived as described but I don&#x27;t like the smell. Not the suppliers fault.</li>
    <li> I have bought this perfume for my mother-in-law on several occasions and she absolutely adores it. The smell is so lovely!</li>
    <li> Randomly searching for a perfume for my mother and found this.&lt;br /&gt;Well packaged and elegant. ended up buying an extra one for my aunt .</li>
    <li> Thanks. It was a good price. And I am satisfied. No one can stop me from getting some tonight. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This perfume lacks the powdery smell that most rose perfumes have, and I&#x27;m so glad for that. The pure rose smell is delicate, but not faint. I would recommend this perfume to anyone who loves rose perfumes, especially for the price. This is definitely one of the most affordable quality perfumes I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> Great scent of roses.</li>
    <li> It is all about the smell...and this is just right. It is a very mild rose perfume that give you a warm feeling.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Rose by Paul Smith. It&#x27;s EDP so it lasts entire day. I have a really sensitive nose, most EDP really bothers me and makes me feel nauseated. But this is very light and with lovely fresh floral scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
