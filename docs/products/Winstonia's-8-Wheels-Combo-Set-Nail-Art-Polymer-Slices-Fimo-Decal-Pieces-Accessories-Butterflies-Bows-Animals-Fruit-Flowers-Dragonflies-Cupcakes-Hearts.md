<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love them there small enough for my kids nails and my nails as well there perfect size for nails .. And easy to put on</li>
    <li> I use these before I apply the acrylic on the nails...I set my nails and file them...then I glue the fimo and then apply the acrylic on top..you don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling off this way and they last as long as u have the acrylics on...awesome!!!</li>
    <li> The designs are awesome but it not that much per design. But its really cute. Too much on flowers and insects.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very cute! I use them when ever I do my nails. The little containers don&#x27;t always do a good job keeping them from mixing but that&#x27;s a minor problem.</li>
    <li> i love these items!! i also like the fact that there are 8 wheels with different designs so you have so many options to choose from. so cute and i cant wait to use it :</li>
    <li> Great value!!  Much cheaper and get way more for your money then buying at a beauty supply store.  So much to choose from, and they are small and most are super thin, which makes it easier to apply and wear on your nails.</li>
    <li> I just do my nails at home and when I saw these I fell in love! The way I use them is i put my 1st coat of polish then let that dry. And then the 2nd coat and stick what ever Fimo pieces i want on before it drys. And then finish it off with a clear coat so they don&#x27;t fall off and are secured on my nail!</li>
    <li> These are such a great deal. There are so many cute options and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Two of the styles had a chunk of the fimo cane that didn&#x27;t get sliced, but you can slice those on your own with a razor blade.  Overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Shipped when it said it would. Some of the pieces were out of the disk or in the wrong place, I just arranged them it was pretty easy. It has a nice variety though some pieces are a bit thick for my taste. I do like it and have used it for pedicures and on my daughters nails. Very nice!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had a great selection to try. They arrived pretty fast and i have used them many times over the last cpl months now. They look great with your design. They did come a bit mixed up but thats no reason to take a star away.&lt;br /&gt;I will be back when I run low, and thanks for the great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;0)</li>
    <li> multy coises of color.you can cose any color you lik it very good nail set.the coloe is emazing . .</li>
    <li> I ordered these and they came in about a week. They come with a great selection of different objects but the down side if that the things are really small. I have tiny fingers and they still didn&#x27;t fit. I don&#x27;t suggest these for everyday use but they are fun.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how they work yet since I&#x27;m still waiting on some tools for nails. But what I can tell you after looking through them. There&#x27;s alot to pick from. You have flowers, fruit, insects (like butterfly) on and on. They are very thin so they won&#x27;t stick up off your nail and catch things. Easy to use a bit of nail glue, after painting, and clear coat after. You can spend 100s of dollars having someone do them. If your like me I like to change two to four times a week. That&#x27;s alot of money for others pockets. I say stay home save your money and do it yourself. Love all the little goodies in this order. Great shipping, I won&#x27;t lie the box was a bit bent, but being they are in hard plaster cases it didn&#x27;t even matter.</li>

    <li> The little designs are ADORABLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;But! they are way too thick... the little figure sticks out and might fall if not enough nail polish used</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;literally&amp;#34; JUST got this product in the mail (Christmas Eve) and I can not wait to use these cute little decals! They are so much better than what I thought.</li>
    <li> Love the variety !! But some of them were cut too thin other wise it&#x27;s an ok buy for nail fun depending on the theme</li>
    <li> not what  i expected.. the packaged slices werent the ones from the picture, and it took an exceptionally long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> What fun for doing nails and having a nail party with friends. bought these for my daughter for christmas and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I just do my nails at home and when I saw these I fell in love! They are cut very thinly and will be a breeze to put on in a manicure. I am veeeerry excited to try these out! Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> These are adorable and perfect for the nail painting parties we have in the dorms! They are thin, cute, and stay on for a long period of time with a top coat. The only thing is that they did not come exactly as pictured... some designs were changed slightly or completely different. I still love the set! Well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> when i saw this offer  i thought they were going to be a bigger size they are very small pretty but small anyways i still like them they were delieverd on time !!I LOOKED AT ALL OF THEM  THEY ARE BEAUTIFULLLLL BUY THEM !!! THIS SELLER IS VERY GOOD AND PROFESSIONAL .BUY THEM BUY THEMMMM !!!ITS EXACTLY HOW THE SELLER DESCRIBED THEM FRUITS HEARTS FLOWERS WONDERFULL</li>
    <li> Ships from China (mine did anyway), the wheels are cute and convenient for storing the decals. The decals themselves are inconsistent with some being very thick and others missing bits but there is a good selection. That the wheels can be used perpetually is the only advantage to this item over the polymer nail art sticks that you slice yourself.</li>
    <li> I found every thing to be just as promised. LOVE IT ALL!! All of the products were of good, durable quality.</li>
    <li> Good when you are in the mood for cute and girly nails.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use cause it&#x27;s already sliced. I tried to cut the fimo cane and finally gave up and all the canes ( more than 150 sticks) are just there to show only.&lt;br /&gt;My fellows, do not buy the canes, just buy the wheels to save your time!</li>
    <li> These are very very thin and that&#x27;s great I think because you can put them anywhere and they look natural. I like their small size because I usually do my daughter&#x27;s nails and she is only 5 and has so tiny fingers. This slices will be perfect for her. Nice product!</li>
    <li> These are a little tricky to get on. They come off easier than when I put on 3-d plastic decals for some reason. These lfit up just enough to get caught on a  lot of stuff. Even when I layer it a million times to try and smooth the overall surface. The fruits are super cute. Some of them are sort of useless though... like the little bugs... Who&#x27;s going to put bugs on their nails, cute or not. Not really me. But most of the other stuff is pretty cute. Nice and tiny because I have teeny nailbeds. Lots of fun.</li>
    <li> I bought for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  I haven&#x27;t completely opened the wheels yet but they look very cute.  I hope there aren&#x27;t too many duplicates.</li>
    <li> I love the selection of the decals. I havnt used them yet, so I cant put an opinion about that. But received quickly,packaging is ok, loved selection. Yes there are some I probably wont use, but the majority is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I feel like a kid again!!! my daughter and i cannot wait to try out all of the shapes on our nails, the unique designs are amazing!!! I love them all</li>
    <li> I bought this as an Easter gift for my daughter-in-law.  She couldn&#x27;t be happier.  She was totally wowed by the amount of selections to choose from!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> The items came on time and all in the wheels separated by type and color. I had to sort a few where the contents shifted into other slots and ended up with a few unusable slices but there are so many that you can&#x27;t even tell. Great variety and no repeats at all. Actually a few extra types.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses all the time and her nails are stunning! She gave me the info to order from Amazon. Now I can play with my nails too!</li>
    <li> There are so many options it is hard for me to pick which ones to use. Only bad part is some of the pieces are too big and they have trouble staying flat onto the nail. I suggest to use lots of nail glue.</li>
    <li> Needed these for extra so I got them and very happy I did especially in purple my fav color yeah</li>
    <li> these are soo cute  there perfect i thought they might be too big  pictures r so deceiving  but there perfect sized  and berry colorful and bright i can not wait to get to use them :)</li>
    <li> This is all about them.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy glue (didn&#x27;t know you needed it), but they use these regularly. they are good quality they say, good variety, good color and details.  All the things a girl needs in nail decals it would seem.</li>
    <li> Great for our Salon- themed slumber party...</li>
    <li> so many different patterns to choose from bought this because i was doing  nail technician course &amp; it had sooo much also sometime these are cut too thin when u buy it else where that the nail bulges but these were cut nice and thin.</li>
    <li> you can not beat the price....they are very cute! i love them....i did not have any repeats. i have had two other friends who have order the wheels and loved them</li>
    <li> This set of nail decals is fantastic! Great variety and it lasts quite a long time after applied. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Exactly as seen in picture but dident come in box only clear packaged and some of the wheels were open so i had to spend time picking up little decals! :(</li>
    <li> Son muy hermosos y tiene una gran variedad a escoger. El precio es increiblemente economico y ha sido el site donde mejor precio tienen por estos articulos</li>
    <li> I received a horrible selection!!! Most of the fimo&#x27;s were too thick to do anything with, out of 15 in each slot you can probably use 3 because when they are cut to thick so they don&#x27;t stick!!!&lt;br /&gt;I got two wheels of dragonflies that are the same thing but in five different colors not twelve like it shows. I won&#x27;t even use the dragon flies, because they look super tacky!&lt;br /&gt;I mainly got this for the fruit/ little animals/ cupcake and hello kitty characters, for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt; When it arrived my 3 year old daughter only liked one design out of all of them! Which were the apples, that I can&#x27;t even put on her nails because they were cut so thick and won&#x27;t stick!!!. Absolutely noooo cupcakes, strawberries, cherries, lemons, duckies or hello kitty characters. I got one creamsicle and the rest random swirls??? The only thing I will be able to use and are cut decent are the bows. Very disappointed will not be buying precut ever again! save you money and buy a fimo cane set they have a 200 canes set on here for 12 dollars with alot more choices and are wayyyy cuter then these crap ones.</li>
    <li> I got eight wheels, however they were not the designs that are shown in the photo or as described. Six seem to be the same, but two are completely different and the ones I really wanted are missing. The slices are not equal either. Some are thinner than paper, and others are a thickness slightly greater than a credit card. Some are even halved so they cannot be used. I will still put these on my nails, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending so much on these. Try some that are a few dollars instead. Shipping was prompt though!</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
    <li> These are so fun! I love all the choices and thought they were sliced very thin. A couple broke but not enough to make a difference. I think the variety was very nice. I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> This was a fantastic set. Tons of choices. There is something here for everyone. Though there are a few of the slices that are a bit too thick most were perfect.</li>
    <li> This is very nice. I was shocked to see how nice it really was/is. This works well for my art/crafts.</li>
    <li> The 8 wheel combo pack of Nail Art have a great selection of nail decals. They&#x27;re all very pretty and provide a great look for any outfit you wear. The price was excellent and mine arrived earlier than I expected. Thank you for such wonderful service.</li>
    <li> I was happy when I opened the package.  The wheels are the smaller 2.5&amp;#34; white wheels with each compartment filled full with a variety of shapes.  The fimo slices are bright and colorful.  Picture is accurate for what I received. Liked it so much I purchased a second one!</li>
    <li> Like ..this is little to much of what i pay but i like it so far.&lt;br /&gt;I will&lt;br /&gt;Buy it</li>
    <li> Love it I use it for my nails I use it on my face it&#x27;s my favorite thing to do</li>
    <li> I bought from the Winstonia Store, and I got duplicate ribbon wheels, and my designs seemed like they were picked through and some of the cuter designs were taken and crap doubled up.  very unhappy. :(</li>
    <li> These little nail art decals are really cute.The picture is different from what it really is, there are some different things. The lil decals were kinda mixed up and some fell out when being shipped. I used tweezers to get them back to place, they do sell something to help you with it but don&#x27;t waste your money you don&#x27;t need it. Just use tweezers ;) or something like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that was received in a decent amount of time.  It is exactly as advertised.  Thanks</li>
    <li> twas fine. do i really have to write this? i&#x27;m not sure. um. what else to say. only thee words more. oh here, i&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time! There are so many cute shapes and sizes and I even am able to reuse them half the time! My friends love them and always ask what they are and where I got them. These are great and shipped in a week! There was a back order on two of the shapes but even those were mailed to me three days later! Buy these, they are definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love them, can&#x27;t wait to use them!!!  They are so cute...I love anything for my nails and these will work great....</li>
    <li> I received this item today. I was kind of worried after reading some of the other reviews, but I am glad that I went forward and ordered these. Yes, there were several that were out of their places  when i received them but what do you expect to happen during transit? The ones that lost their place were still in the wheel, it&#x27;s not like they fell out of the packaging or anything.  No big deal, I&#x27;ll just put them in there correct compartments. I received a wide variety of fimo and all seem to be cut very thin which i love! I can tell that they are thin enough to adhere to the nail with topcoat. The main reason I ordered this item was because I do a lousy job at cutting fimo canes and never seem to get them thin enough and they never lay flat. These are cut perfectly and very thin. I am super happy with this product. Another A+ from the Winstonia store!</li>
    <li> THESE ARE SO AMAZING. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I think the Chanel logo heart ones were a bit cheesy for my tastes, BUT overall these are so wonderful and the perfect size and assortment!!! I highly recommend them and can&#x27;t believe how great of a deal they were. They did take a bit longer than usual though, but overall very pleased!</li>
    <li> Perfect size and shapes. They were exactly what I thought they would be. I especially loved the bows! I would recommend these!</li>
    <li> The description of this product is accurate. I purchased them for a little bit of fun. The limes made a great accent to my margarita manicure! They are super cute and fun to play with. They are cut pretty thin, but will still feel bumpy under a top coat.</li>
    <li> They are itsy bitsy and so gosh darn cute, I know how silly it sounds but it is so true. They are cut very thinly and will be a breeze to put on in a manicure. I am veeeerry excited to try these out! Totally worth it. They came fast and they are exactly what was advertised :)</li>
    <li> recommended to everyone wanting easy nail art application.&lt;br /&gt;easy to use. great nail art.&lt;br /&gt;quick shipping considering.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
    <li> i loved how they were shipped and packed, nothing broken or spilled, but they wont stay flat on your nails and it gets annoying! would recomend these to wear for a fun get together or party</li>
    <li> SMALLER WHEELS THEN I THOUGHT... SLICED TOO THIN,. AND THEY WERE MIXED UP. THE PACKAGING WAS GOOD. THEY CAME IN A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT THEY DEF LOOIK LIKE FIMOS AND LOOK LIKE THEY R WHAT I NEEDED. HAVENT TRIED THEM YET BUT THEY COULD OF BEEN NEATER AND SLICED A LITTLE THICKER.</li>
    <li> My wheels came a little later than expected, but they are exactly as shown in picture. For the people who don&#x27;t know how to use them, this is the way to;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It&#x27;s easy!) First apply nail polish on the nail you&#x27;d like to decorate, then choose fimo cane slice&lt;br /&gt;you want to put on the nail (make sure then nail polish didn&#x27;t dry yet). Then let dry. After that apply top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slices were nice and thinly cut. The bows and the flowers were decent and cute. It&#x27;s really fun to use them and I can&#x27;t wait for my cousins to come and create beautiful nails! I&#x27;m very happy for what I&#x27;ve received. I love this product.</li>
    <li> The things didn&#x27;t stick with my glue we&#x27;ll. they just curled up. It was hard to get them out.yep yes</li>
    <li> Great nail art. Every wheel has very colorful pieces. Looks great on the nails. Good buy for the price. Nice</li>
    <li> Thickness consistency varies. Besides that, they are cute. The pieces were scatter, but you get what you pay for. I think I will buy it as a stick next time and cut it myself to control thickness.</li>
    <li> this product was purchased for some residents at a nursing home.  I like this item because it will make them feel like they are at an real nail salon.</li>
    <li> You really do get a lot my daughter loves them . It is really cute to . For the money it was a great deal.</li>
    <li> I got my order very quick, less than a week. The nail art wheels were packaged tightly in a small box so all the little decals were still where they should be. I am super pleased with my order! The decals look very nice and they are sliced really thin for easy application. I would recommend this product to anyone! Thanks a lot for being prompt and for being true about your product. I am a satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> some of the little slices where all mixed up int the wheels but it only took about ten minutes and a pair of tweezers to fix that. it came faster than i had expected it to come too. there where some messed up slices like some where too thin or broken but not too manny at all and they where all different and pretty.</li>
    <li> I recently started doing my own nail art because the nail art in my area is pretty blah. I ordered these to give me some diversity. They are very bright and colorful. They are super thin and easy to use. I&#x27;m going to order more when I need to.</li>
    <li> I love how there are so many choices to choose from. However. when I got them (the wheels came in a box) the pieces were everywhere! I had to take each little one and put it in the right compartment. It wasn&#x27;t easy since they were thin pieces of paper. I like my purchase, but I wasn&#x27;t happy in the state they were in when I got them.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a similar product and was unable to find it again from the same store. The items are better quality than those I purchased in store.</li>
    <li> These look just like the photos and I&#x27;m excited to use them, but some of the wheels were open when they were received so now I have to sort them.</li>
    <li> Very Fast shipping!! These are soo cute! They can with all the things listed, with a few minor changes. They are small and thin, so they fit perfectly on nails. I am so happy with this i do recommend to others very good price!</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I found them really cute to put on nails. When they came, the bag was ripped and the nail decals were everywhere. It took me at least 30 minutes to get everything in their proper positions. They were pretty small too. The whole wheel can be fit on the palms of your hands. Some of them are damaged and ripped, but its okay.The designs are very cute and very thin so you can easily get them on your nails. :)</li>
    <li> I just got these today, and although they are smaller than I thought -  I absolutely love them! There are tons of different ones, each with assorted colors. They are in nice containers to keep them all separate, and were shipped with lots of bubble wrap to ensure safety! The delivery time is a little long, but the product itself is amazing! I will def. be buying more :)</li>
    <li> I just recieved in my nail decals, and I love them. Shipping took about two weeks, and I was suprised they came so fast. For the price, you could not find a better deal. All the decals are so fun and there is a lot of detail in each type of decal.</li>
    <li> They are amazing! The quality is good especially for the price... I will definitely order more in the future. Love them&amp;#60;3</li>
