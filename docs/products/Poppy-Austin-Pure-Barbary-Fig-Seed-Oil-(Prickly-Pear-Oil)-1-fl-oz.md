<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love! I&#x27;ve tried so many products only to be disappointed.. this stuff is amazing. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was using Argan Oil by another manufacturer.  I like the Barbary Fig Seed Oil even better.&lt;br /&gt;It is moisturizing without being at all sticky.  I will definitely be reordering!</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer.  This keeps my skin nice and soft, without feeling oily.  I love how my skin looks and feels; very dewy.  My fine lines are less noticeable.  I bought the whole collection from Poppy Austin and went back to buy more to stock up.  I am now a loyal fan.  Very, very happy with all of their products.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wonderful natural serum for skin. I love using this serum every morning and night before moisturizer .</li>
    <li> Love it.  don&#x27;t need much.  It feels smooth and very nice on my skin.  I am anxious to see how my skin begins to lookup more youthful and even.</li>
    <li> Lovely oil that absorbs well into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling &#x27;oily&#x27;. For mature skins a great moisturizer under a sunblock or BB cream.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it is a little pricey.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to try it out. I really love this moisturiser. This keeps my skin nice and soft, without feeling oily. You don&#x27;t need much. Just 2-3 drops is more than enough. I am anxious to see how my skin begins to lookup more youthful and even.I love how my skin looks and feels. I bought the whole collection from Poppy Austin and went back to buy more to stock up. I am now a loyal fan. Very, very happy with all of their products. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Oh My Goodness!!! Honestly, I could see a difference after using it for a week!  I&#x27;m 62 and the difference it made in reducing fine lines was amazing, not to mention skin tone and pores getting smaller.  To say I&#x27;m a satisfied customer is an understatement!  GREAT!</li>
    <li> Best.product.ever.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously do yourself a favor and buy this if you want skin like he kind of skin you see in comercials</li>
    <li> Just got my bottle of Fig Seed Oil by Poppy Austin and I must say I do feel a difference in my face already. The oil absorbs nicely and does not leave a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling to my skin. The product was delivered as promised,​ and I received a text confirming it was delivered, great customer service!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is supposed to smell or look like cooking oil, but it does, I&#x27;m kind of afraid to keep putting it on my face. I really hope I didn&#x27;t get ripped off, especially since it was so expensive.</li>
    <li> I am not convinced, perhaps I need to use this miracle anti aging product for a lot longer.  I have only used it a couple of weeks.  I will keep at it!&lt;br /&gt;It is okay for a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This works really well. I have noticed a big improvement to my skin!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer smells very pleasant, and it leaves your skin very soft without the oily looks and feels to it. I totally recommend this product even for those with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it as a night moisturizer and my skin feel great</li>
    <li> The best! !!!!definitely a must buy. After a couple of days my friends were asking me why was my skin glowing.  And I do see a difference in the elasticity of my skin.</li>
    <li> Really great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am 64 and very happy to have found not only a great product that I feel good about using, but an ethical company as well. Wish I  could have had it decades ago. I love the Vitamin C and Argan Oil, and just got the Barbary Fig. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for about a week and I love it!!  I use this oil every morning and every night.  I do layer another lotion moisturizer on top of it for extra moisture since it is winter time.  But this works great by itself.  Id imagine it would be great alone during the summer time; Something light but moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This saved my skin during my recent trip to New York.  It kept my skin plump, supple, and youthful looking and moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type: normal - combination skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yays!:&lt;br /&gt;- Does not leave heavy feeling on skin at all, skin takes it in right away.&lt;br /&gt;- Has not clogged my pores&lt;br /&gt;- Has not broken me out.&lt;br /&gt;- Obviously dewy because its an oil, but doesn&#x27;t make you look like a grease ball.  its a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;- Makeup applies beautifully!!!  especially concealer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;- Skin feels super soft&lt;br /&gt;- I am 25 years old and dont have wrinkles, but I  do have fine lines especially under my eyes.  That being said, I have noticed the fine lines on the corners of my eyes, and under eyes appear less noticeable.  Not drastic, but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nays!&lt;br /&gt;-the smell.... it smells like canola oil or vegetable oil.  Not saying those are foul scents, I just personally dont like that scent.  Its &amp;#34;in your face, POW!, canola oil/veg oil smell&amp;#34;  the first couple applications, but you get use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend.  I also love that it is 100% pure and organic (so it says).</li>
    <li> I have been using the Fig oil for a short time, but I already love it.  It&#x27;s light and it absorbs pretty quickly.  I would recommend this product.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this Fig Seed Oil from this seller. This oil is THE BEST on the market.  I read about this precious oil in a German magazine. It was highly recommended. There was only one problem. This oil wasn&#x27;t available for purchase yet. So they recommended to buy it in the USA. I ordered it immediately and love it.  It smells great. It is very thin and you only need a few drops.  I found it to be perfect for under any moisturizer or cream.  I apply it in the morning and at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for about a month now, and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with it. I don&#x27;t know about the anti-age properties, but sure moisturizes better than anything else I tried, it&#x27;s not greasy at all and is a great primer for make-up. The only downside is the price, but I think is a smarter investment than most expensive face cream on the market.</li>
    <li> Really love this oil so far. I had thought it would be fragrant and wanted to use it in body butter. Instead I have been using it as a moisturizer and am quite pleased!</li>
    <li> The feel is wonderful, the results are visible. I can&#x27;t ask for more than that. I do believe I see a difference already, and those few dry flaky spots have disappeared. I am very satisfied and plan on remaining a customer.</li>
    <li> Seems to be moisturizing my face really well so far.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 1 week and my skin is soft as a babys bottom, so at 50 what more can I say. My makeup goes on smooth after applying poppy&#x27;s argan oil and it lasts all day. The area around my mouth and eyes are smoother. I&#x27;m very sensitive and suffer from rosecia but I had no problems using this.</li>
    <li> This product is no where near as moisturizing as I had hoped. My fine lines don&#x27;t look any better then when I use cheaper products. I used it after a chemical peel and got very little relief. I went to my local health store and got some now brand argan oil to try because my face burned. I applied it after washing of the fig oil and yaaay!  Not only did it soothe my skin but the fine lines around my eyes looked better immediately. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t end up spending twice as much for the poppy austin argan oil I was going to order. I will not buy the fig oil again. I gave it 3 stars because it came quickly and I guess I&#x27;m hopeful it will do something. Feels good on my face normally like not after a peel but just doesn&#x27;t help the fine lines like the atgan oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week and I already notice a reduction in my laugh lines and pore size. It&#x27;s fantastic. It absorbs quickly and is very hydrating. I don&#x27;t think I could live without this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only recently heard of this product, read it in Poppy Austin&#x27;s site when I was ordering the Vit C serum, decided to try it, I&#x27;m so very glad I did! I used this on top of Vit C serum and Argan oil, worked my 12 hour long night shift with my skin feeling so smooth, soft, and supple all night! I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another bottle just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out, maybe next payday. Thank you Poppy Austin for making these quality products affordable for us. Love your company vision statement.</li>
    <li> I have severe allergies and I have to use natural products on my face.  I really like the benefits of this product and the fact that it comes from a single, natural source - it&#x27;s simple.  I also have oily skin and this product absorbs quickly, works great under makeup and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Used to for 2 days and have had compliments that my skin looks smoother!.. I have noticed a healthier glow with me skin as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks and not consistently. I take a couple of precious (expensive) drops and rub my palms together and then press the warm oil on my neck then on my eyes then on my lips. Two drops go that far. Then I go start back at my neck and keep pressing and lightly massaging until all the oil is absorbed, then eyes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see a dramatic change. BUT, it has not caused those pesky little white things (silia sp?) around my eyes that many eye creams do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, flaky, aging (slow turnover), blackhead and cystic pimple prone skin. Oh and hyperpigmentation. I have a lot going on and use aggressive skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will up date if there is note-worthy change or improvement.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product made of the finest quality, pure ingredients. The entire Poppy Austin line is the best skin care line available. Their all natural products rejuvenate your skin naturally &amp; show visible results for an extremely reasonable price. Furthermore, the company donates a portion of the proceeds of EVERY bottle sold to a women&#x27;s charity in Morocco. (Read all about it on the Poppy Austin website.) You will love this product as well as their rose water toner, Vitamin C Serum and argan oil. So glad I found these amazing products. I will never switch skin care products again. Use Vitamin C serum after cleansing your skin with rose water toner, then apply argan oil or barbary fig oil as a natural moisturizer. I recommend argan during the day and barbary fig before bed (as it tends to make skin a bit shiny).</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Fantastic company. I highly recommend this amazing product!</li>
    <li> Great product. This is the first time that I purchased Poppy Austin product and I have to say it&#x27;s all great quality and I love it.</li>
    <li> This was very pricey for something that did not work. I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this product so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. To me, it smelled rancid. I use a lot of essential oils so I know what oil smells like when it&#x27;s old &amp; that&#x27;s what it smelled like. I don&#x27;t think it was the fig, It just smelled old. I gave it 2 stars because it was an oil &amp; it did provide a moisturizing effect.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Barbary Fig Oil. I love this product and use a couple drops twice a day under my moisturizer. My skin is dry and my cheeks tend to get red easily, this product keeps my skin hydrated and does not irritate. This oil feels great around my eyes, and lips too.</li>
    <li> Good serium.  I put it everywhere - face, eyes, elbows, backs of my hands, etc.</li>
    <li> made my face too oily</li>
    <li> Love it ! It&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> The last review I wrote was before I had used this for a while ( about a month) and WOW I can definately see a difference in the softness of my skin. It&#x27;s GLOWING and it is pure pleasure to put on. The scent is a beautiful fragrance . I can&#x27;t wait to use it every night!</li>
    <li> A lovely oil. Not too oily on the skin. And you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your face and neck.</li>
    <li> it has a very unusual smell - rather bad - but I am using it with other products</li>
    <li> I try to source products and companies that are ethical, clean, organic and have great customer feedback and following. No more mainstream products with too many fillers and toxic chemicals from unethical, uncaring mega corporations for me! This is why I have been using Barbary Fig Oil for a couple of months and am very pleased with this product. After cleansing my face, I massage this oil into my skin.  My face feels so soft, and at bedtime I reapply to keep hydrated.  I also use this in conjunction with Poppy Austin&#x27;s Rose Hip and  Argan oils and Vitamin C serum.  I&#x27;m 57, live in cold northeastern weather, and am a seasonal golfer so I need products that will help my maturing skin survive the dry winter air or the warm humid summer---so far, so good!  I do recommend purchase if you&#x27;re hesitating.  Argan oil is wonderful also for hair; makes mine very soft and manageable even though I have a pixie cut.</li>
    <li> Use as facial moisturizer.  Good product and price.</li>
    <li> I read about this product on a blog recently and the benefits sounded promising so I thought I would give it a try. This product does everything I expected it to. I use it on my face daily now instead of my regular moisturizer. I also use it on my nails. I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t ever want to run out</li>
    <li> I have used argan oil facial moisturizer for the last year with excellent results and honestly thought this would be similar. It was so much better! It left my skin soft and radiant and while it did not eliminate fine lines completely, it certainly softened them to the point where they were less noticeable. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The Barbary Fig Seed Oil is the last Poppy Austin Product I use at end of the day, after washing with the Rassoul Clay and then using the Rose Water Facial Toner. Like all of their products, a very little goes a long way. My skin feels so soft and moist without being greasy.  I love all of their products because they are all pure and do not have all of the additives that every other product I&#x27;ve ever used (all of them have been supposedly the best quality and expensive to prove it).  I believe that less is more, especially with products I put on or in my body.  Even their approach to the bottling of their product is pure with no fancy wrappings or bottles because it&#x27;s really what&#x27;s inside that matters.</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to like this, based on the research I had done, but I think I am one of those people who can&#x27;t use oil on my face. I purchased the Poppy Austin barbary fig oil it for nighttime use, and the Poppy Austin argan oil for daytime. I started breaking out, so reduced the amount I was using of each ... then I tried them separately, using only a drop mixed with my regular moisturizer once a day. Every time I try either of the oils, I break out in terrible acne within a few days. I am giving it a longer rest now, and may experiment again, but I actually am hoping I can find a different use for these oils. I love the glass bottles, and I believe these are pure and quality products. I just don&#x27;t think they will work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Barbary Fig Seed Oil Moisturizer for about 3 months now and truly have noticed a difference in my skin...it is so much softer and brighter looking. I would absolutely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product about a month and don&#x27;t see any changes to my skin.  It goes on well, isn&#x27;t greasy, but doesn&#x27;t really give a lasting &amp;#34;dewy/soft&amp;#34; finish during the day.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it has replaced my other moisturizer.  You only need about 3 drops to use on your entire face and neck.  I can&#x27;t believe how soft my face feels now.  It has never felt this great before.  Will use for the rest of my life…and I am only 41, so I have a long way to go (hopefully). ;)</li>
    <li> nice light quickly absorbing, gentle, my skin feels great! Love this company&#x27;s responsible policy. I am tired of putting chemicals on my skin and it is doing much better on natural products.  Will absolutely buy from this company again!</li>
    <li> I am a 56 year old woman and I have tried many creams and serums but this stuff is amazing!  I have an oily T area so I was cautious to begin with but it normalized my whole face.  My skin is glowing and two different people have asked what beauty pill I am taking. So worth it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil, shipped quickly! I also appreciate the fact that your products are organic.Thank you for selling such a high-quality, NATURAL product!</li>
    <li> So far so good, using Vit C oil, followed w/ Rose Hips Oil and then this... perfection in the morning as used before bed. Skin soft, fine &amp; moderate lines near gone in one use! Really pleased, as this is new product for me... A must to read about what these specific oils do for your skin. In my 50&#x27;s with delicate soft skin. The product line I was using reorganized after 13 yrs.Tried everything for 6 mo and my face kept cracking! I have tried high end products to low drug store lines ... this is perfection!</li>
    <li> Purchased this along with Vit C serum.  Very pleased with how well it keeps  my face and neck hydrated in a dry Colorado climate.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this moisture to use on my forearms. I am in the over 50 club now and the skin on my forearms was getting thin and easily scratched to the point of bleeding. I use this every day- 3 or 4 drops per forearm followed by moisturing creme and I have had far fewer injuries.</li>
    <li> Really love using the Barbary Fig Seed Oil.  It never leaves a greasy film just sinks right into your skin leaving it soft and dewey.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Really love this Anti Aging Moisturizer. Absolutely the BEST. So glad that I found Poppy Austin</li>
    <li> Age: 35-45&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: Oil/Combination&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! This oil is very light and very absorbing...leaving my skin soft and even toned just as other reviewers have claimed. I have to thank those who left a good &amp; honest review for this product! It is a really wonderful product and I anticipate to buy more of this barbary fig seed oil very soon!</li>
    <li> Received well pack and in good conditions. I love this oïl, I put it every night before bed. Thank you !</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this a lot - especially at night, since it is a bit oily for daytime in the summer.  I love it that you are fair trade, and I have liked all the products I have bought form you.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to try it out. It is awesome! I&#x27;m getting older every year, and I&#x27;m no spring chicken haha, but this instantly lifted my entire face. The first time I used it there was an instant difference! All of the fine lines and wrinkles around my brows and eyes smoothed out immediately! It&#x27;s like a little face lift, and the best part is, it&#x27;s all natural too!! Also, it didn&#x27;t cause any break outs, and it makes my skin feel amazing! It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily sheen, or residue. I would highly recommend this moisturizer! I have decided to try all the other products Poppy Austin offers too, I have been looking for a skin care line that was all natural and proactive against premature aging, I think my search may be over.</li>
    <li> after a few weeks using, happy to say my skin loves this. Moisturizes well and you only need a few drops! wonderful</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and you don&#x27;t need a lot, I will definitely be ordering more when I run out.</li>
    <li> absolutely love it. it helped my skin thru new york winter, and now in the heat. never before did i wake up without tight feeling on my face. now, my skin is glowing. i really love it. will definitely buy it again. there is one BUT tho) it doesn&#x27;t go well with my concealor. water based product doesn&#x27;t work with oil) but! i actually rather change my concealer.</li>
    <li> This is the newest hot ingredient for the beauty care market and I was excited to try it. I am now on my 2nd bottle and can say that it works and feels amazing on your skin. I am now a believer and swear by it. The odor is pretty non offensive, just sort of smells like unscented oil. I would highly recommend this product!!  If you have never heard of this ingredient you need to try it ASAP because it is likely to become as popular or even more popular than than Argan but it feels like my little beauty secret right now.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Barbary Fig Seed Oil along with the Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid by Poppy Austin for three weeks and am amazed at reduction of the size of pores on my face. I have tried many many products and none have given me the results that these products have. I had suffered an allergic reaction to something which resulted in hives under my eyes and ultimately skin that looked like leather in several places....I remember applying my make up for Easter and couldn&#x27;t believe how bad my complexion looked. After using the Vitamin C Serum and Fig Oil all the dry patches are gone and I have glowing skin with the smallest pores I have ever had. I suffered from acne as a young adult and continue to be prone to occasional breakouts. I was somewhat concerned that the Fig Oil could cause breakouts. I am glad to report that this is not the case. When you first apply the fig oil it seems oily but I allow it to absorb in for about 10 minutes before I apply my BareMinerals make up.  Love, love these products!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference within a week and I am so happy! I use the oil every morning and night. My skin looks so much more fresh, even and moisturized.  I have definitely noticed pore reduction and skin tone feels more even.  My skin type is oily and this product does not make my skin more oily - it is just more balanced now.</li>
    <li> Great as a moisturizer. After 1 minute it soaks into skin and it has helped my skin look less dry and wrinkled. Great for the lips too!!!!</li>
    <li> Poppy Austin has great customer service!  But I am not a fan of very many of their products, this one too.  It did nothing for my skin except it appeared drier.  I must say I am a very very picky skin care person having owned and formulated  products for high end retailers, so my review will be harder than most folks, but I do expect my skin car regimen to work and this does little for me. I do think they have pure clean products but they need to have the formulation that will actually enter the epidermis and not just sit on top.  I sent the product back and will try it later when the formula is tweaked a bit!</li>
    <li> Three tiny drops dotted around the eyes, lips and forehead. Absorbs quickly. Lovely fragrance. All natural. I&#x27;ve said it before, Poppy Austin is my new favorite brand. This is incredibly softening. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Rose Water, The Vitamin C Serum, the Barbary Fid Oil and the Eye Cream.  I am trying to decide on these products.  My skin feels greasy, which I don&#x27;t like at all.  I will give them another week, if I am not completely satisfied with them I will return them.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff, I&#x27;m on my second bottle. My skin looks hydrated and discoloration/redness is minimized every time I use it. The oil is really thick (in my opinion), so it may be best suited as a nighttime oil. I also am dealing with some ~fabulusss~ adult acne, and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for about 2 weeks and unfortunately the bottle was knocked over and spilled most of it out :( Really really bummed because it was so expensive and would have liked to see the results of the product.  I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I think i think the customer service is great. It did take a little longer to l get to me than my first time ordering from poppy Austin.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed esthetician in New York and New Jersey. I use a lot of product but love oils so I decided to try Many of the Poppy Austin products. After I cleanse my skin I apply Poppy Austin Rose Water while my skin is still damp I press the Barbary Fig seed oil in to my skin. I love these products. In the evening I use the Argan Oil and I even apply a nighttime moisturizer over it ( I use an all natural moisturizer from another company that contains Argan and Retinol from natural source) I highly recommend trying these products. Also, Great Price!!! Definitely try the Rose Water!</li>
    <li> awesome oil.  use it at night under night creams.  can also be used over day creams.  leaves the skin silky, and indeed reduces fine lines.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the whole line of Poppy Austin products and I have to say that they are wonderful on my sensitive/dry skin. I especially love the vitamin c serum and Barbary fig seed oil! I can already tell a difference in my skins moisture level and fine line! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this moisturizer - the best I have ever tried. It made my skin feel very smooth and hydrated. It got rid of my redness and puffiness. I will continue to use this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> So soothing.  Helped clear my daughter&#x27;s acne</li>
