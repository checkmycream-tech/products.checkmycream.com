      <li>My face felt smoother, but I broke out more often.     </li>
      <li>The better part never came.</li>
      <li>This product is phenomenal.</li>
      <li>I have been using Proactive for many years now and while it works I still get pimples all on my chin.</li>

      <li>I am more than pissed with the result I have on my face after oxy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really excited to have this product and plan to buy the full system once my sample pack runs out!!</li>
      <li>(Clean &amp; Clear is also very good.)</li>
      <li>As far as the wash system goes it does a great job.</li>
      <li>At first from reading the bold and confident descriptions labeled on the sample package, I believed I would get good results.</li>
      <li>Hands down this cleaning set is the best..</li>
      <li>The blackheads don&#x27;t \\&quot;return\\&quot; as fast as they do before after being pressed out (using another solution and warm water), but they are still there.</li>
      <li>Since I use a face wash every morning and night, using the Advanced Face Wash wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
      <li>I have now gone out and purchased the advanced facewash, the treatment and will be getting the hydrating therapy soon.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, it is cheap--</li>
      <li>The blackheads don&#x27;t \\&quot;return\\&quot; as fast as they do before after being pressed out (using another solution and warm water), but they are still there.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve got light acne don&#x27;t bother getting this, if you&#x27;ve got stronger acne get something stronger.</li>
      <li>I have light acne</li>
      <li>While it does strengthen the skin on your face I did not see great results until later when I changed my diet.</li>
      <li>It was fast and easy to use but after some more days of using this product, my face burned a lot.</li>
      <li>I also use an astringent by neutrogena called clean pores with 2% salcylic acid</li>
      <li>I have a bright red chemical burn on my face.</li>
      <li>I am going to try acne.org 2.5% benzoyl peroxide made by dan kern which should be more gentle than the 5% benzoyl peroxide that comes with the oxy clinical.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the full size and have noticed if I stop using it diligently my zits start creeping up on me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the more gentle products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>First is the Advanced Face Wash.</li>
      <li>I remember I went out right after I used it</li>
      <li>Day 1, I was great, I saw my skin becoming less red</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and yes, this does make my skin very dry, but with a moisturizer on top of these products, my skin looks and feels infinitely better than it ever did with Proactiv.</li>
      <li>I can only imagine how well it would work if I used it for a week or more.</li>
      <li>First thing, it took forever to arrive, maybe because of weather problems or something.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 4 weeks, and I just got my first break out of 3 zits.  </li>
      <li>On the first day i used it, the pimples were still there.</li>
      <li>I tried the 3 week trial through OXY first.</li>
      <li>the problem i had was the ups driver left the package on top step not at the door nor did he knock on the door either and a dog got ahold of the package</li>
      <li>I love totally recommend it and</li>
      <li>If your skin is sensitive like mine I recommend using a good moisturizer with this as it does dry my skin out a lot.</li>
      <li>They also didn&#x27;t really portion the amounts right.</li>
      <li>I bought this product after nothing worked, Proactive, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, AcneFree etc.</li>
      <li>I was not required to write a positive review.</li>
      <li>I was not required to write a positive review.</li>
      <li>, it certainly does.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used various acne treatment brands in the past, but this is by far the best brand I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Giving up fruit and fruit sugars for a few months and eating more vegitables high in fiber can increase results significantly and gives time for your skin to get stronger.</li>
      <li>But most of all I love that when I run out of one of the little bottles, I only have to purchase the bottle I ran out of instead of the whole kit.</li>
      <li>Huge different.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to the day it is marketed here in Malaysia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product free from the brand through its public relations company, Robin Leedy &amp; Associates.</li>
      <li>: I received this product free from the brand through its public relations company, Robin Leedy &amp; Associates.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, BEWARE!!!</li>
      <li>The other thing I love is how matte it makes my make-up.</li>
      <li>I am so excited and my face is starting to look like I am not a teenager !</li>
      <li>Most products irritate my sensitive skin, and cause it to dry and peel, while I continue to break out in acne.  </li>
      <li>I must admit I do have sensitive skin and this product isn&#x27;t exactly a dream for me..</li>
      <li>So it is a lot less wasteful than most systems I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>My skin appears to be smoother, less oily, and more even in texture.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I would recommmened that you try Ponds Morning Refresh and Evening Soothe facial towlettes, they work and smell much better.</li>
      <li>and I can definitely tell my skin has a mild chemical burn.</li>
      <li>I stopped using OxyClinical and went back to my original regimen, and my face is now clear, without the burn and itch.     </li>
      <li>I think benzoyl peroxide is the main reason I clear up so much</li>
      <li>I used it a few more times, just to see if it was a reaction to something else</li>
      <li>I had a massive breakout which rarely happens</li>
      <li>When I woke up in the morning, there was a rash all over my skin, and I don&#x27;t normally have any acne there, along with the fact that I&#x27;m not allergic to anything.</li>
      <li>The astringent seems to be working to prevent new pimples (nothing new today).</li>
      <li>As obvious, this pack contains three different face treatment solutions - the Advanced Face Wash, Clearing Treatment and Hydrating Therapy.</li>
      <li>I bought this Oxy Clinical test based on the fact that it had better reveiws than any of the other facial cleansers that I was looking at.</li>
      <li>It was amazing I immediately saw the difference my face was much less oily and my zits started to dry up ASAP.</li>
      <li>Not only did it dry out my skin horribly, it actually BURNED the top layer.</li>
      <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll be clear again without any flaky skin.</li>
      <li>I noticed that it helped clear the oil on my face at a quicker rate.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t clear to me if I should be using all three products 2x/day.  </li>
      <li>I do have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I received a sample containing items from the complete kit.</li>
      <li>My skin has become clear and soft.</li>
      <li>it is suppose to be a months supply.but as far a amazon goes</li>
      <li>Advanced Face Wash, Clearing Treatment and Hydrating Therapy can be used twice everyday.</li>
      <li>The first two days my face itched a lot and got really dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Company sent me a sample of the line and I used it last night when I received it, woke up and the majority of my pimples were clear. My skin looks great, almost as good as when I was taking the antibiotics prescribed by my dermatologist. Anyway, I&#x27;m 25, and hate the fact I still have to deal with acne, but this works great. My only issue is that I can only use once a day or it makes my face itch. I cannot use twice a day, just once, and great results!</li>
    <li> As far as the wash system goes it does a great job. the problem i had was the ups driver left the package on top step not at the door nor did he knock on the door either and a dog got ahold of the package and i lost about half of the wash foam. so i will be running out of that before the month is up which it is suppose to be a months supply.but as far a amazon goes it was a good experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne on my back for a few years and I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and I still had horrible acne on my back. I got a sample in the mail and I used it for 3 days. 70% of my acne is gone! I can only imagine how well it would work if I used it for a week or more. I&#x27;m very impressed and will buy this product ASAP. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a month with only minimal results. While it does strengthen the skin on your face I did not see great results until later when I changed my diet. You are battling the inside of your body with the outside layer (skin). I recommend using this product combined with a diet low on carbs, sugar, and fried foods. Giving up fruit and fruit sugars for a few months and eating more vegitables high in fiber can increase results significantly and gives time for your skin to get stronger.</li>
    <li> I received a sample containing items from the complete kit. I only used this once and my face is now a disaster!! Now mind you I do have somewhat sensitive skin but this is insane. I had a massive breakout which rarely happens and I can definitely tell my skin has a mild chemical burn. Little white heads have been popping up all over my neck and face and my face is so sore from whatever additional chemicals are used in these products. If you have sensitive skin, BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> As obvious, this pack contains three different face treatment solutions - the Advanced Face Wash, Clearing Treatment and Hydrating Therapy. I have used various acne treatment brands in the past, but this is by far the best brand I&#x27;ve ever used. I was amazed at the speed my acne disappeared after using the Clearing Treatment. The Clearing Treatment promises to eliminate \\&quot;99% of acne bacteria in just 8 hours\\&quot; and judging by the results, it certainly does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Advanced Face Wash, Clearing Treatment and Hydrating Therapy can be used twice everyday. First is the Advanced Face Wash. Since I use a face wash every morning and night, using the Advanced Face Wash wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. I noticed that it helped clear the oil on my face at a quicker rate. After wiping my face dry, I would apply the Hydrating Therapy. My only complain about this solution is its pungent smell. I apply this solution on nearly my entire face. Next would be the Clearing Treatment. I apply a thin layer of this cream on the acne spots. This solution has a strong smell, but it isn&#x27;t as unpleasant compared to the smell of the Hydrating Therapy solution. I am very pleased with the results of the Clearing Treatment. My acne has either disappeared completely or become less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not consider my skin sensitive due to the number of various facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used in the past. However, I had a skin irritation problem after using these solutions when my face was dry. I was in an air-conditioner (and thus, cold) environment for two days last week. When I applied the Hydrating Therapy and Clearing Treatment solutions, there was a burning sensation on the skin above my mouth and around my nose area. I had to wash the solutions off and use a toner to remove any solution left over on these areas. A day later, the skin on those areas started to peel. All these irritation symptoms ended when I got back to my usual non-AC environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the OXY Clinical Acne Solutions for two weeks. I love the results I&#x27;m getting from it. The only thing I wish it would remove is the blackheads on my nose. The blackheads don&#x27;t \\&quot;return\\&quot; as fast as they do before after being pressed out (using another solution and warm water), but they are still there. Nevertheless, I am entirely satisfied with the OXY Clinical Acne Solutions product.

    <li> I got this product because I have bad acne. The morning after using this product for the first time I had a terrible rash all over my face and neck. It itches like crazy!!!!!!! Still does 3 days later!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very small SAMPLE size bottles. Maybe I missed it in the description but I thought they would not be as small as what they were. Not worth the money. The product didn&#x27;t improve my situation, but didn&#x27;t make it any worse either.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample and tried it when my face began developing numerous pimples. I tried this product for a couple of days and was discouraged to use it afterward. At first from reading the bold and confident descriptions labeled on the sample package, I believed I would get good results. It was fast and easy to use but after some more days of using this product, my face burned a lot. I got a rash on my face and the smell from the face cream smelled horrible.     I stopped using OxyClinical and went back to my original regimen, and my face is now clear, without the burn and itch.     If you don&#x27;t mind a burning and itching sensation on your face, buy OxyClinical.</li>
    <li> I am a 27 year old female who has struggled with acne since I was a teenager but it has never been as bad as the last year. The three step processes that I have used and that have also failed me are AcneFree Severe, AcneFree (regular version), ProActiv, Neutrogena Advanced Solutions, and Clean N&#x27; Clear&#x27;s three step program. I recently (about a week ago) bought Oxy Clinical and have been pleasantly surprised by the results. The first two days my face itched a lot and got really dry but when you have acne like I do, dryness is next to godliness compared to acne. After that my skin was completely clear for a few days until the dreaded time of the month came. I got two cystic blemishes but after using Oxy Clinical, those two blemishes completely disappeared after only two days (compared to the about a week with other products). The other thing I love is how matte it makes my make-up. It is like a primer. But most of all I love that when I run out of one of the little bottles, I only have to purchase the bottle I ran out of instead of the whole kit. So it is a lot less wasteful than most systems I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Hands down this cleaning set is the best.. I am 27 and NOTHING cleans my face and clears up break outs lie Oxy Clinical has. I have tried everything, and I love love love love this! It doesnt dry out and long as I use it with the moisture system too! It clears my face up within the first couple of washes and after a week of use, I can go from using twice a day to once, and then it doesnt matter if I miss a few washes. Its wonderful!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after nothing worked, Proactive, Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, AcneFree etc. My skin is pretty bad recently so I figured this combination of products would do the trick. Day 1, I was great, I saw my skin becoming less red and it began healing.  The third time I used the product, I washed my face in the shower and waited about 20 mins to apply the second product.... my face tightened so bad that I couldn&#x27;t move my jaw.  Since then my face is flaky and peeling so I have to moisturize it constantly.. it&#x27;s not fun. I must admit I do have sensitive skin and this product isn&#x27;t exactly a dream for me.. but it might be for someone else!</li>
    <li> I was a Proactiv customer for almost ten years. However, it never cleared my skin how I would have liked it to. It certainly helped, but I still broke out constantly, while using it on a regular basis. I was frustrated because nothing else seemed to work as well as Proactiv, and I still was never confident about my complexion. I spent tons of money on different products of theirs with the same results. I saw the sample kit for Oxy Clinical and figured, I had nothing else to lose but $10. I was amazed with the results of this product. I have very sensitive skin, and yes, this does make my skin very dry, but with a moisturizer on top of these products, my skin looks and feels infinitely better than it ever did with Proactiv. I&#x27;ve saved a lot of money switching to this product. I still break out, but it&#x27;s not nearly as often. Huge different. The clearing treatment is harsher on my skin than the other two products, so I wash my face in the morning, and follow it with the hydrating treatment and a moisturizer. At night, I wash my face again, and use the clearing treatment instead, followed by a moisturizer. It cuts down on the dryness, by alternating, and I still get the same results. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It cleared my skin up, but it causes a lot of flakiness.  I remember I went out right after I used it and I put make up on over it.  I was wondering why people were looking at me and I looked in the mirror and the top layers of my skin was peeling off causing it to look like I was shedding.  I stopped using it not too long after that because I didn&#x27;t want to have the peeling like it did.  I am going to try acne.org 2.5% benzoyl peroxide made by dan kern which should be more gentle than the 5% benzoyl peroxide that comes with the oxy clinical.  I am going to use benzoyl peroxide with my redness soothing 2% salcylic acid neutrogena daily cleanser and neutrogena combination skin moisturizer.  I also use an astringent by neutrogena called clean pores with 2% salcylic acid and I use cotton rounds to apply it.  The astringent seems to be working to prevent new pimples (nothing new today). I am also going to try 5 drops of jojoba oil with my moisturizer to hopefully help flakiness when I go back on benzoyl peroxide.  I think benzoyl peroxide is the main reason I clear up so much so I am going to start using it again.  I read and try to pick from reviews on products that people think work.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll be clear again without any flaky skin. :)  Erin/25/F</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this pack and used it once on my 30-year-old combination skin when I noticed 4-5 zits start popping up over a few days. That was the worst mistake I&#x27;ve ever made when it comes to my face! As soon as I put the Clearing Treatment and Hydrating Treatment on, I could tell something was wrong. I washed it off immediately, but it was too late. Not only did it dry out my skin horribly, it actually BURNED the top layer. I have a bright red chemical burn on my face. Who knows how long it will take to go away.    I&#x27;ve totally learned my lesson. From now on, when I notice a few zits pop up, I&#x27;ll chalk it up to hormonal fluctuations and not stray from my usual skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for three days now (going on fourth). For the past few weeks I have had horrible acne all over my chin and around my mouth. On the first day i used it, the pimples were still there. The next morning I woke up, and they were almost completely gone and no where near as red as the had been for weeks! then on the third day (today) I have absolutely NO PIMPLES ON MY CHIN OR FACE. I have a little bit of pink of where it had been in a few spots, but they are going away. skin is actually softer now that I have been using the Hydrating treatment! I have never found something that has worked like this. EVER! My sister has had bad acne since we were kids and struggles with it as an adult today and I recently turned her on to OXY Clinical. We will see how that goes! RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> After looking at all the reviews, i thought this was the product for me... but sadly... it was not... made me break out soo much . Used it for a week and i couldnt take it no more. I went back to using Oxy Benzoyl peroxide face wash.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have major acne, just some blackheads and alot of small bumps on my forehead. The cleanser works wonderfully along with the clearing treatment (I only use the tx on my forehead). My skin has become clear and soft. The lotion however is horrendous that is why I gave the kit 4 stars. The lotion is slippery, very weird texture, and doesn&#x27;t really moisturize at all. I will still continue using the cleanser and treatment.  This product is getting harder to find though. Is it being discontinued??</li>
    <li> This product never really worked for me. It&#x27;s one of the more gentle products I&#x27;ve ever tried. (Acnefree actually burned my face). I have light acne so there was no real use to get something expensive.    I was always under the impression that your acne will get worse using these products then get better. The better part never came. My face felt smoother, but I broke out more often.     They also didn&#x27;t really portion the amounts right. You get a TON of the facial wash, but not much of the benzoyl peroxide mix. I&#x27;m guessing they want you to use the benzoyl peroxide mix as a spot treatment, but they never mentioned it in the instructions. The moisturizer however was one of the better moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. I would buy that again separately.    If you&#x27;ve got light acne don&#x27;t bother getting this, if you&#x27;ve got stronger acne get something stronger. On the plus side, it is cheap-- so if you want to just try this out to see if it works on YOUR skin, go ahead.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter because she was so impressed with the free sample that she got in the mail...</li>
    <li> I have been using Proactive for many years now and while it works I still get pimples all on my chin. Proactive sort of takes care of the problem but never completely get a break.       With that being said my boyfriend suggested that I try this and got me a sample. I had in my bathroom for at least a month because I was afraid that if I switched it would make me flare up even worse.     I eventually was having such a bad breakout that I decided to just get it over and try it. It was amazing I immediately saw the difference my face was much less oily and my zits started to dry up ASAP. It was great.       I ordered the full size and have noticed if I stop using it diligently my zits start creeping up on me. I love totally recommend it and it is way less expensive then my proactive! I am so excited and my face is starting to look like I am not a teenager ! Can&#x27;t beat that !     The only con that I found was that my neck has been a little dry and red so I do not recommend putting it around your neck.       Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal. I tried the 3 week trial through OXY first. By the end of the first week after using the product everyday my face was red and RAW. Tight, scaly, and ultra painful. I looked around online and saw some people were having the same reactions and that they switched to using the product every other day or every two days. BINGO! I tried this and it turned out to be perfect. My acne has gone away and my pores have closed up considerably. My favorite item is the clearing treatment. It works like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I have now gone out and purchased the advanced facewash, the treatment and will be getting the hydrating therapy soon. The full size products are just as strong as the trial and are wonderful. If your skin is sensitive like mine I recommend using a good moisturizer with this as it does dry my skin out a lot.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t clear to me if I should be using all three products 2x/day.  So I chose to use the face wash 1x/day at night, and switch off each night between the Clearing Treatment and the Hydrating Therapy.    I am 26 have suffered with moderate acne as a teen, and mild-moderate acne as an adult.  Most products irritate my sensitive skin, and cause it to dry and peel, while I continue to break out in acne.  This product has done the opposite (and my reduced regimen may contribute to less drying).  I have been using this product for 4 weeks, and I just got my first break out of 3 zits.  This was expected since I typically break out before my period.  My skin appears to be smoother, less oily, and more even in texture.  I&#x27;m really excited to have this product and plan to buy the full system once my sample pack runs out!!</li>
    <li> I have dry combination skin. I bought this Oxy Clinical test based on the fact that it had better reveiws than any of the other facial cleansers that I was looking at. First thing, it took forever to arrive, maybe because of weather problems or something. When I first used it, i noticed that it smelt HORRIBLE. It almost made me gag, but i continued to use all three products. When I woke up in the morning, there was a rash all over my skin, and I don&#x27;t normally have any acne there, along with the fact that I&#x27;m not allergic to anything. I used it a few more times, just to see if it was a reaction to something else but the rash didn&#x27;t go away until I stopped using Oxy. Overall, I would recommmened that you try Ponds Morning Refresh and Evening Soothe facial towlettes, they work and smell much better. (Clean &amp; Clear is also very good.)</li>
    <li> I have used oxy clinical face pads anf afre a one day of using my face started breaking put and it was covered with dozens of bumps not mention pimples. sorry I wont use oxy products again, never again, terrible experience. I have never had a skin problems and they appeard after I used oxy. I am more than pissed with the result I have on my face after oxy. NEVER.[[ASIN:B0052QRY38 Oxy Clinical Cleansing Pads, 90 Count]]</li>
