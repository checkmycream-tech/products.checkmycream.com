<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product combined with the vitamin c serum..i have the worst case of pregnancy mask for about 11years now and this product has done me justice. I honestly thought obagi was the answer but it only made the situation worst. With many months of patience, I saw results and I&#x27;m thrilled I found the organic way of helping my skin to finally recuperate. I hope this product will do you as much justice as it did for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months now, my skin feels softer and looks great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Daily Moisturizing Lotion of Candid Essentials for almost a month and I have to say that it is amazing. I appreciate that all their ingredients are organic and naturally derived. This cream is rich in antioxidants, it helps to prevent wrinkles and spots. I feel my skin really soft, smoother and with a natural glow. My skin is absolutely moisturized. The jar is simple and beautiful. I do not use my fingers to grab the cream from the jar. I use cotton swabs to keep the cream free of bacteria.  I like the soft smell. It absorbs quickly in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion I have really dry skin on my face and this has worked miracles It has also reduced fine lines in my face.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I bought this product and have been using now for a few weeks and I love it.  It is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  I will order again and again!  This is now the 2nd time I bought this product and I will be using it for a very long time.  It is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used.  I have had many compliments on how smooth and beautiful my skin looks since I have started using it.</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother after applying it on my face after I shower.</li>
    <li> Luscious cream--I really like it--but was surprised that the jar was so small.  The picture makes it appear to be taller. I know there was information about this amount of cream contained in the bottle, but I don&#x27;t have a sense of size just reading how many ounces are in a jar.  I also go by how the picture appears.  Again, though, a lovely, luscious cream.</li>
    <li> I live in Wisconsin and the weather here really plays havoc on your skin and especially your face. With this Daily Moisturizer I get many benefits. I can get the benefit of having soft and dry skin. It also helps with fine lines and wrinkles. I really like the fact that it&#x27;s a light cream and not at all greasy. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film on your face so you can apply your make-up soon after you moisturize. I am glad I was chosen to test this product for quality because it is one of the better moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. It absorbs quick so that&#x27;s another plus in my book and I would recommend this cream to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin and this moisturizer is just what I was looking for! Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I can t say is anti aging face cream.I will use it some more and see if I get any results.I will leave another review after more using it.</li>
    <li> Have definitely noticed a difference in the overall quality of my skin since I started using this and have already reordered this product. I am 49 yrs old and have noticed fewer age/sun spots, overall clearer skin, smaller pores and more even skin tone since starting this last fall. This leaves a nice clean feel, not too sticky or greasy, with a mild sell (not perfumey). I alternate it in the evening with a heavier, anti-aging night cream.</li>
    <li> This is a really great moisturizing cream. I have notices a big difference in the fine lines on my face since I have been using it. It instantly hydrates my skin and leaves it soft and smooth without making it greasy or oily! It&#x27;s made from natural and organic products, which is definitely something that I like in a product. Its unscented which is also important to me in a face cream. It&#x27;s really a great product and I am happy to have recieved it to review. I would definitelty recommend it!</li>
    <li> My wife(WHO&#x27;S VERY PARTICULAR) Loves It.</li>
    <li> Made my forehead dry and flaky.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer.  I have sensitive skin and this works well for me.  Hope it remains available.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long ways. It is non-greasy and goes on smooth under makeup. Unsure if I would be purchase it again</li>
    <li> This is thee most amazing moisturizing lotion I have ever purchased! It is clean and simple with the necessary ingredients and nothing more! No strange odor or flaky feeling on your skin subsequent to application.  It truly is exceptional! I will continue to purchase it for sure. I love it, and you will too!</li>
    <li> The best daily face cream I have ever used and I have used a lot of different kinds over the years.  My skin looks smoother.  I will not be without this cream. I have been using this for a few months now and it just feels good on my face. I don&#x27;t have as many wrinkles and my deep lines are a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After several months of use now I still love this cream.  It is just perfect for me.  I have combination skin.  My skin just looks so much better after using this along with the vitamin c serum.  I do not use anything else on my face under my makeup.  I am almost 59 years old and so I need very good products on my face at this time.  I will always use this.&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12-19-16.  I have been using this now for a couple of years along with the vitamin c serum.  I love how my skins looks now.  I will be 60 years old in 2 months and people tell me I do not look like it.  Moisturizer is very light and you do not use very much of it at all.  I do not believe in botox or anything like that on my face.  So that is why I like this so much.  I don&#x27;t have to use anything like that because this combination of moisturizer and serum work just as well without putting anything harmful on my skin.</li>
    <li> This product seems to have been open already when I received it. Makes me skeptical... Tried the cream... Sticky feeling. Not sure how I feel about it.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality face cream although it has no scent so I put a few drops of my own essential oil in it. It is rich and creamy and now smells just the way I like it.</li>
    <li> I really like it and I  notice the difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Texture seems fine; however, a few minutes after application my skin still feels dry.</li>
    <li> It applies smoothly, and is not greasy looking.  Perfect under foundation and moisturizing.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used another brand of skin care products in the past, but was looking for something to replace this.  I have found it!  This Daily Moisturizing Lotion is incredible and I have seen results in just a few days.  I have a few acne scars and sun spots, but these were visibly diminished overnight, it seems.  I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the moisturizer arrived and the product was leaking out around the seal.  This made me question whether the product had already been opened or if it had just leaked out.  Either way I was a bit disappointed, especially since I purchased this at a deeply discounted rate for product testing.  Despite this, I did try a dab of the moisturizer on my hand and the product seems to be good.  It is almost scent free which is great for anyone with allergies.  It leaves your skin feeling smooth and hydrated but not greasy.    Update:  I was contacted directly by the provider after leaving the initial review.  They extended their apology for the manner in which the moisturizer arrived and offered to send a new one. I am looking forward to update my review again after using the moisturizer on my face for a few weeks.  I hope I can edit my review to reflect 5 stars!    Update:  I received a new container of moisturizer and have been very pleased with the way this moisturizer is treating my face.  Excellent customer service and I am pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Works well</li>
    <li> From the moment I opened up the jar of moisturizer, I was impressed.  Rather than a flimsy plastic seal like many products have, inside the lid is a recessed plastic piece made of reasonably thick plastic so that it&#x27;s actually sturdy (I tried to show this in my photo).  I&#x27;m going to hold onto that piece of plastic - I can&#x27;t count how many times I&#x27;ve had things leak when traveling despite trying to keep everything nicely sealed in ziploc bags, and I think that will help to prevent any unwanted accidents!  This is a tiny detail, but it is clear that the manufacturer paid attention to little details in packaging, and that made me think that the product inside had a good chance of being equally good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So onto the actual moisturizing lotion!  This stuff is great!  It is light in texture and quickly absorbs into the skin without any greasy feeling.  I have seborrhea on my face, especially my forehead, which is especially an issue this time of year during the subfreezing winter temps - I was totally amazed that after using this moisturizer in the morning, I had no itching or flakiness on my forehead the rest of the day!  I never had to put on any other products to help with irritation, because there was none.  What a nice surprise!  So pleased that I was able to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I received this vitamin C lotion in the mail for a consumer review and I cannot say this enough, I love any product that helps me stay looking younger, longer. This is another one of those products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This anti-aging cream is a light weight lotion that absorbs quickly into the skin leaving it soft, but not greasy. I like that the fragrance is not overpowering. It has a light, clean and fresh scent to the lotion. This is an advanced anti-aging product that will help to keep your skin looking its best by smoothing out the wrinkles that are present and helping prevent or delay new wrinkles from showing up. I like to use this product in the morning before I put on my makeup. If you do the same, make sure that you give your lotion time to dry before putting your makeup on. This lotion is completely natural and organic. I love that the lotion is &amp;#34;8 fold antioxidant protection&amp;#34;. The formula is made up of vitamin C, shea butter, jojoba, vitamin b5, green tea and aloe vera. The ingredients work together to reduce the appearance of age and to help hide age spots or skin blotches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great to have on hand to use for yourself. I also think that it makes for a thoughtful gift. I am going to put this product into beauty baskets that I give to the girls in my life.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great service. The Daily moisturizer is not greasy and I was thrilled to see positive results in just a week.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! Cleared up my skin and helped reduce my pores.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer.  Very creamy and rich. I&#x27;ve only used it a week so can&#x27;t say what the long term effect on my skin might be.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer keeps my face feeling great all day! I put it on day and night and it feels great!  I have only used it for a week now so I can&#x27;t talk about how it helps with the anti aging benefits or anything else but I will write another review after awhile!</li>
    <li> Actually I bought this for gift. She has wanted to have one as this product is famous for her ages.</li>
    <li> I am submitting this review with all honesty - why, because people trust reviewers&#x27; comments on something which they&#x27;ve already tried and expects your honest experience (I do at least).  Here is my experience with this cream and how it reacted to my skin. This is a fantastic cream - I wanted to try this to see what was all the ripping and raving about from the previous reviewers stating how much they love this product and how great the results are.  Well, I tried it for myself and I agree, this is the best cream on the market (my opinion).  I&#x27;ve tried many high-end products and they just irritated my skin.  I have sensitive skin and this is the only product that actually cleared my skin from any irritation and smooths out your completion.  I used this cream day and night just to keep my face moisturized.  This product is simply marvelous!  What a glow to your completion and that&#x27;s why this is an anti-aging cream which make you look younger. It smooths, moisturizes, and eliminates any acne - no more dull looking skin even at age 60!</li>
    <li> Feels good, absorbs quickly.  Not noticing fine lines as much.  Looking forward to seeing how my skin improves with usage.  I purchased it because of the ingredients it doesn&#x27;t include--and those it does.  I like that I am putting something healthy on my skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice for dry sensitive skin I put it on twice a day once in morning after I shower and once at night after washing face.</li>
    <li> this facial moisturizer is light weight, non greasy, &amp; only needs a little bit to fully hydrate the skin of my face &amp; neck</li>
    <li> I was trying to give me sometime and see how I like this product., well, I like it very much: Is odorless, no greasy it leave my face very smooth, no reaction if I sweat, perfect for under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again and again!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because of the ingredients and I love it.  My usual acne cleanser tends to dry my skin so I wanted to add a moisturizer but most of them usually give me pimples.  Luckily I haven&#x27;t broken out with this one. It&#x27;s very lightweight and didn&#x27;t make my face shiny. I apply just a thin layer because a little goes a long way for me with this cream. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My skin is moisturized all day with one application as my day time moisturizer. My skin looks and feels healthier and glowing.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff.  I have been with Clinique for centuries and accidentally ordered this. Now that I&#x27;ve used it about a month, I am pleasantly surprised.  It seems to protect and heal, yet is not greasy or visible.  Make-up goes over it beautifully without smearing.  So far I think it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face smooth and clear! I feel good that I&#x27;m not putting a bunch of chemicals on my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to review  product when i just started using it and cannot see any results - this takes time.  I did receive this product on time and with no problems.  I sure hope it helps my dry skin but then i am 61 years old and am realistic in realizing that it&#x27;s hard to reverse the aging process.  Slowing down this process is the best i can hope for.</li>
    <li> I received the order very quickly.  I do love this moisturizer and I am going to purchase the serum to go along with this product.  I only gave it 4 stars because I have used it less than a month.  I don&#x27;t know if it will remove the dark spots under my eyes, yet.  The lotion is not heavy to the face so it does not wear you down.  That is a big plus.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  I was already a user of the Vitamin C serum from Candid Essentials and tried the moisturizing face cream at the urging of a friend. I LOVE THIS CREAM!  I&#x27;m 52 and this cream absorbs quickly and is not greasy. It makes my face so soft. It&#x27;s great and at 52 I can honestly say it works!  I will continue to use this cream as well as their other products. Can&#x27;t wait to see what they come up with next.</li>
    <li> My skin has felt dry dry dry ever since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I feels very nice &amp; moisturizing but I am waiting to see if it will fade some dark spots on my face. So far so good! I&#x27;d probably buy it again!</li>
    <li> I tried this moisturizer because I was using their Vitamin C Serum and they recommended to use a moisturizer after.  I live in a humid climate and it does not leave my face oily or slick.  I feel that my skin absorbs it nicely and I apply it twice a day. I recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Ordered and reordered- I like it...</li>
    <li> no smell, silky smooth on skin, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for some time and my face is softer and does not break out. I have very sensitive skin and try a lot of face creams and haven&#x27;t found one as good as this one yet.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a night cream, waking with very smooth-feeling skin in the morning. However, it is a bit too rich for my normal, occasionally acne-prone skin and I would not recommend it for daytime use, unless you have very dry skin. I am a big supporter of organic, natural, cruelty-free everything and would suggest this product to any of my friends. Realize that any change to your skin care ritual will take time to produce results and there really isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;one-size-fits-all&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Feel very smooth and soft</li>
    <li> Creamy, Rich, Hydrating!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this cream!, I love the way my face feels.&lt;br /&gt;Love that is organic!&lt;br /&gt;Love that it is non greasy? sticky! (like alot of others.)&lt;br /&gt;Love the light sent.&lt;br /&gt;Love the glass jar! (no squishing in my night stand,)&lt;br /&gt;Love that my skin looks and feels younger, my skin was looking old and tierd, at 49 I assumed it just comes with age&lt;br /&gt;becuase I always moisturize, but nothing has ever lit up my face like this has!&lt;br /&gt;Literally erasing dark sun spots before my very own eyes. (true story!)&lt;br /&gt;My friends are all asking me what I am doing different?&lt;br /&gt;Love that I was offwred this product to test and review. I give this lotion 5 honest stars!!!</li>
    <li> I love the facts of how this is made and the ingredients are all face friendly. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks with no problems except smooth skin. Very satisfied with this. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> nice moisturizer - like that there are no parabens - would have liked it a little thicker and a little less costly.  Overall, nice!</li>
    <li> Good Product. Still is a little to greasy for me. Its not nearly as bad as the other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used but still wish it was less greasy. I know most of that has to do with my complexion. I&#x27;ve always had oily skin. So, I wash my face three times a day so I can use moisturizer and not break out extremely bad. Still haven&#x27;t had any bad breakouts yet, but will update if I do. Been using for 3 weeks straight and usually after the first couple of days, I would have a bad breakout of pimples on all other products I have used. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I got this for my 70 year old mom was said she was out of face cream, after looking at reviews.  she initially requested Kiehls but I noticed the product she wanted had no reviews so I got her this cream as well as another highly rated one, serumtologie® PURE Whipped Chiffon, to see if she would have a new favorite.  she had a slight preference for the serumtologie® PURE Whipped Chiffon but she did enjoy this one as well enough to where it took her a week before she could state which was her favorite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps:  you guys are relentless with your review requests</li>
    <li> 5 stars. Love it.  I can see a difference in my complexion.</li>
    <li> Super service, Yakuts product. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am a 50 year old woman.I have very dry skin and I smoke which makes my skin  that much more terrible. Sun damage takes years to see on your face. I have tried every moisturizer on the market and nothing helped! I have been using this moisturizer  for a couple of weeks and am happy to report that my skin is softer,my skin tone has evened out, My face looks a lot brighter.those pesky crows feet look better.. I am confident  with continued  use those crowsfeet and laugh lines won&#x27;the be as noticeable.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer.  I have 50+ year old very dry skin that is still somewhat reactive and prone to react to stress or chemicals.  This cream is one of the best I&#x27;ve used and I have typically spent 5 times as much. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Creamy and smooth ! I Love the way it makes my skin feel so soft and silky after each use. And during these winter months I need a lot of moisture for my dry cracking skin  . This is really a great product.</li>
    <li> Nice product goes on smooth no irritation at all.. you can feel working and tightening... subtle smell not over powering... very nice price</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has great fragrance in it. It has pretty decent packaging. My skin is so dry and mostly anti aging serums make my skin so dry after applying. And i need to moisturize right away. This cream is 2-in-1 you dont need to moisturize your skin after applying it. It is anti aging and works as a moisturizer as well. The moisturizing effect is long lasting. My skin look so clean and youthful after applying it. I really like it amd highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to use and give my honest opinion and I am so impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very light cream, that does not have any overwhelming smell to it...the kinds that make you want to gag when you put it on...you know what I mean out there. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it says it is fragrance free, there is a hint of something in there, but it&#x27;s very fresh smelling, maybe cucumbers? Do not let that bother you, as it is really light, and frankly, I like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not greasy at all, which is one of the things I look for in any high end face cream. It also absorbs almost immediately into my skin. Very impressive. I also am using this on the back of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the cream is organic, but 1 or 2 of the ingredients gave me pause. Only time will tell, and I have only been using this product for under a week. Because of the short time I have used it, I only feel comfortable giving it 4 stars. However, after I use it a few weeks, if I see more positive results, I will increase my review. Obviously, of I see bad results I will decrease it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I like it well enough to continue to test it, which in my book is a big positive. I am also using it on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for right now, I will give this product a 4 star review, but I will still recommend it, as I am still using it, and so far I am happy. (After using this for a few months I have updated it to five stars as I really like it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review - its just my opinion.</li>
    <li> This face lotion is fantastic - even in summer, it absorbs quickly, is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my face oily toward the end of the day. I&#x27;ve tried other organic face lotions, but none had these results.</li>
    <li> When I was offered a free sample for review, I originally had assumed I would test this on my hands. My face is very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after opening up the bottle, I found the scent and feel to be light enough that I trusted it on my face. I originally covered half of my face with the lotion and left half uncovered. After a few moments I compared the two and I was very pleased with the results. They weren&#x27;t magic, but I could tell the difference in the dry lines around my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following this test, I compared this to one of the most moisturizing products I have on hand - pure Argon oil. The following day I covered 1/2 of my face with this lotion and 1/2 with the Argon oil. Both were light, but I actually preferred the lighter feel of this. So in my personal test, it actually outranked Argon oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, my face is very sensitive so the fact that this works well on my face without making it itch would garner it four stars. The extra star is the fact that I am pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have to decide for yourself if this is worth the cost, but I&#x27;ve had a rough year and my face needs all the help I can give it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this face lotion for less than a week and I&#x27;m hooked.  I&#x27;m SO picky about my skin care products and I&#x27;m telling you, this is it!  You can literally see and feel a difference immediately after applying it.  Skin glows and looks plump and youthful!  Hoping the results get better over time!  I just went online to order another one since it was such a good deal and it&#x27;s already unavailable!</li>
    <li> I have just in the past 2yrs had issues with acne. The cleanser I normally use, tends to dry my skin out which seems to cause more pimples.  So I wanted to find a moisturizer that would keep my skin moisturized with out the oily feel. When I saw the chance to try this product at a deeply discounted rate, I couldn&#x27;t resist purchasing it to at least try. When I received the Daily Moisturizer, I was happy. After opening it,  I was impressed with the durability of the container &amp; lid it comes in. From the first application, I was impressed &amp; excited to continue using this moisturizer. As soon as I applied it to my skin, it quickly absorbed, however not leaving my skin feeling greasy. Also seemed to keep the moisture for a great amount of time. I had no itching or flakiness on my forehead the rest of the day! I never had to put on any other products to help with  dryness or irritation. That in all, made me very happy. I can confidently say that this is a great product &amp; would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good product, at the moment it is good for my sensitive skin, i am 42 years old, White and sensitive skin.  I have proved other brands like chanel and dermalogica, and i think this cream is better than them. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer..&lt;br /&gt;No harsh ingredients, light weight, absorbers fast, remains for long yet doesn&#x27;t creat a film.</li>
    <li> Okay, I have to say this cream is really good. I am a devoted SkinMedica consumer, but I wanted to go organic and start using more natural products, as I was starting to have acne problems that I have never had before.  I purchased the cream along with their Vitamin C Serum and they both work well together. I am on week 3 of using both and my face has never looked clear or better. I also cleaned up my diet and started eating very healthy and organic, so together I believe all this has helped. I would definitely recommend trying their products if your interesting in going natural/organic.</li>
    <li> I needed some facial moisturizer for my nighttime routine.  This cream isn&#x27;t too thick, but it&#x27;s rich enough to do the trick.  I have been applying it every day.  It&#x27;s not greasy, my skin feels hydrated.  I haven&#x27;t gotten clogged pores nor have there been any reactions.  It&#x27;s good enough that I want to continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Candid Essentials.</li>
    <li> Not the best moisturizing cream. Time will tell if any results occur.</li>
    <li> very nice item!  came quick.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a face lotion that would help to moisturize my face. My skin is very testy and I live in an area where the weather constantly changes and causes havoc on my skin.  The lotion I was using wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough and I noticed the skin on my face was beginning to get flaky, especially when wearing make-up. Ever since I began using this lotion, the flaking has healed and I think it has also helped to even my skin tone a bit. It definitely has brought relief to my face. All-in-all I am pleased with this product and will most likely be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> It is a really affective product with good results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom as a Christmas gift.  She feels that her skin is normally itchy and more dry than it used to be when she was younger and she also has mild rosacea.  She just let me know she is loving this product and her skin isn&#x27;t itchy during the day now that she is using it.  She is really happy with it, which makes me happy because my mom is hard to buy for.  This was a good purchase and I&#x27;m thinking I will try it myself when I run out of what I&#x27;m using at the moment.</li>
    <li> Incredible moisturizer!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail and opened it to try right away, and I was very excited to try it! And I was not disappointed!! Used a small amount on my face and omg my face feels so soft already! Cant wait to see what the results will be after showering and applying, as I usually get dry patches on my face. And who cant use a little help in the aging department? I did receive this product at a reduced rate to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Not to oily but great moisturizer.. I love that its organic and natural with all the toxins out in the world its nice to be able to use something that isn&#x27;t full of them to help my skin.. I notice right away the feeling it gave my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a huge jar but a little goes a very long way and I am using it on my face, neck and back of hands.. Hoping to slow down the hands of time... No horrible smell, not greasy just the right amount of everything... Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this as a sample to test but these are my honest and unbiased opinions...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know this product is made naturally or not. But my mother-in-law gets a bad allergy when she first uses it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect lotion. This is it. It&#x27;s super light, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin. It&#x27;s fragrance free and has a very faint hint of something like cucumber, but I don&#x27;t know which ingredient the smell actually comes from. The vitamin C you can really feel. It definitely gives that dewey feel everyone is always looking for. Love it.</li>
    <li> This cream feels very nice on your face. It&#x27;s moisturizing without feeling greasy. It was shipped to me on time and I am very happy with the seller and product.</li>
    <li> It is a moisturizer that I will have to get used to.  I have been using Merle Morman products for years. Feels very good and will try to keep applying until I figure out whether it suits me or not. Thank you</li>
    <li> I just received this as a gift along with their Vitamin C Serum and I&#x27;m obsessed. I have been using this twice a day for 2 weeks now. It absorbs quickly and seems to be a wonderful base under my makeup. It is a nice compliment to their Vitamin C Serum. LOVE BOTH. I can&#x27;t wait for more products. So far I love this new brand.</li>
    <li> Great product - no perfume scent - really works well !</li>
    <li> Great product for moisturizing your face skin and give yourself a younger look! I&#x27;m very happy with the products !</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my skin feel so soft! I have tried several different ones that were expensive and didn&#x27;t give me the feel of this one. I recommend this to everyone. Just look at the other 4 &amp; 5 star reviews for yourself. I agree with those as well.</li>
    <li> I could see that the item was packaged with care. It keeps my skin moisturized all day . it is not greasy. very light.  will order again when needed..C.&#x27;s wife</li>
    <li> Beautiful and sensuous moisturizer that absorbs cleanly into your skin.  I love how it leaves no sticky residue once applied, and how it makes my skin feel soft instantly.  I was able to purchase this at a promotional price and was eager to try it.  I have now made this part of my daily morning routine (apply it after my toner, but before my make-up).  Seeing it was never tested on animals,  only includes natural ingredients and has a 100% money-back guarantee I feel comfortable recommending it to all.</li>
    <li> I love products with natural ingredients like this one.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift. They loved it but said it made their face a bit too shiny.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this moisturizer because of an available price break when paired with the Vitamin C serum I was seeking. (I love a good deal.)  Yesterday I had a professional facial and asked the cosmetologist&#x27;s opinion of the face products I am using. She strongly advocates all-natural products.  She was very impressed with the ingredients found in Candid and did not have any products she would recommend in its place. I have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin and she told me my skin was beautiful. I think Candid is very reasonably priced. (Too often I have fallen for: &amp;#34;Higher the Price the Better the Product.&amp;#34;) Candid also provides a helpful site for questions and concerns. I am happy, happy. I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS CREAM FOR 3 WEEKS AND SEE A DEFINITE IMPROVEMENT.  MY SKIN TONE IS MORE EVEN, AND MY SKIN SEEMS MORE VIBRANT.  I DON&#x27;T EXPECT MIRACLES SINCE I AM ALMOST 70, BUT MY SKIN DOES APPEAR MORE HEALTHY.  I PURCHASED THIS CREAM HOPING IT WOULD HELP ELIMINATE REDNESS THAT HAS SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE CREASES AT MY CHECK AREA.  IT DOES SEEM THAT THIS PROBLEM IS NOT AS SEVERE, BUT STILL REMAINS AN ISSUE.</li>
    <li> I have been using another product for my neck for about 4 years. Changed over recently to this one, and it is much better. I also like using it on my face when I feel really dry!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I will be ordering this product again!</li>
    <li> no weird smell, a little bit goes a long way, best product I have used in a long time</li>
    <li> The best lotion and moisturizer yet! I have used this daily under my make up application and I have to say, this feels SO nice. It locks in the moisture after a shower and my face feels softer each and everyday. I decided to use this also on my hands because they were so dry, and it worked wonderful. I will continue my daily use. There really isn&#x27;t a sent to this. I have very sensitive skin and this did not have any side effect that I have had to deal with in the past. I highly recommend this product. It works better than I could have ever expected.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face and most Anti-aging skin products clog my pores and then I break out. I was offered this Daily Moisturizing Lotion from Candid Essentials for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion and thoughts about it, I decided to give it a try. I saw that it was 15% Vitamin C so I know it shouldn&#x27;t be oily or thick, which probably won&#x27;t cause any breakouts. So I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and not only is my skin soft and smooth, there&#x27;s no blemishes! I&#x27;ve been using a c serum under this Daily Moisturizing Lotion and I can say, this is probably going to be my long time face moisturizer. I definitely recommend this product for everyone, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Just have it a short time but I do like it so far, would of given it 5 stars but we will see. It feels good and creamy, going on.</li>
