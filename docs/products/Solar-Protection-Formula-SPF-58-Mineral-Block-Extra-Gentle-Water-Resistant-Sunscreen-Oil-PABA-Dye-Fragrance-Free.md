      <li>This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used on my face.</li>
      <li>This is our best seller among our SPF products.</li>
      <li>It did seem then quite incredible, matt and matching my skin colour quite well.</li>
      <li>And a great price too.</li>
      <li>I make my friends happy when they use it.</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>Good texture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite fair</li>
      <li>Good stuff.  </li>
      <li>skin protection and looking good on it.</li>
      <li>Provides good protection.</li>
      <li>Though some may like a tint, the tint is quite opaque compared to a tinted moisturizer, and a fair color at that-</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with what it is supposed to accomplish.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>works well, blends nicely.</li>
      <li>The product goes on clear on the skin and gives excellent sun protection.  </li>
      <li>This sunblock is very light and non-greasy, nice light tint.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to have a non-tinted option.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen......doesn&#x27;t leave the white sticky coating like many others I have used.</li>
      <li>This product is the one that gets easily ot of stock.</li>
      <li>I use it primarily on my face where I&#x27;ve had some sun damage.  </li>
      <li>you want a lighter, scent free SPF that truly works, this is the one for you.</li>
      <li>I have to use fragrance free items on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have had some minor skin cancers and this product has been great protection for me..</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is nevertheless a good product considering total sunblocks are always a bit problematic, either greasy or whitish.&lt;br /&gt;The positives: apart from staying matt</li>
      <li>Very silky smooth feel and goes on easily.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing TRUE mineral (offers longer more extensive UVA and UVB protection) sun protectant, with NO smell, and a light to medium weight</li>
      <li>I live in AZ and need a strong protection.</li>
      <li>it seems to hold pretty well and offers strong  protection.</li>
      <li>After walking in the hot sun and wiping sweat off my face, it still stays on.  </li>
      <li>It was first recommended to me by my plastic surgeon.  </li>
      <li>It is matt enough and am happy about that, but whitish and makes my face look pale unless I brush on lightly a  darker colour on my cheeks and forehead to match my skin</li>
      <li>I use it everyday, it is very good ,not oily and it last for a whole day without reapply .</li>
      <li>The instructions say &amp;#34; May stain clothing&amp;#34; and I can guarantee you it will absolutely do just that.</li>
      <li>Dont have to reapply very often.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper buying it online.  </li>
      <li>This sunblock does the job without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to get it promptly.</li>
      <li>I did not burn, but ruined a new white top due to the color of the product rubbing off my neck onto my clothes.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it works better for face only but am not interested in trying again.</li>
      <li>My only criticisms are: that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize your skin at all, and it makes you look ghosty when you first put it on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for my face.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problem with this one causing that problem, and it seems to work well as far as sun protection goes.  </li>
      <li>I found myself only using it on my arms and chest as I do not like much coverage on my face, and I found it gave a &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have another sunblock that has been very effective, but it frequently ends up migrating into my eyes and stinging like crazy until I rinse out my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Less staining on clothing than most other sunscreens</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t care so much if it matches my skin as long as it works and it does!</li>

<li> and this is the only product the sun can&#x27;t &amp;#34;get through.&amp;#34; It reminds me of zinc oxide we used to put on our noses when at the beach all day - but without the white gooy mess.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s a bit thick going on, but it does the job.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was recommended by my doctor &amp; have been using it for a year now. It&#x27;s so much cheaper buying it online.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Provides good protection. It is slightly tinted.</li>
    <li> The product goes on clear on the skin and gives excellent sun protection.  I use it every day here in Kauai!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else  on my sun damaged face.  My doctor recommended it years ago and I have been using ever since.  Don&#x27;t care so much if it matches my skin as long as it works and it does!</li>
    <li> I buy this product every year. It&#x27;s gentle enough for my face. Less staining on clothing than most other sunscreens</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used on my face. After walking in the hot sun and wiping sweat off my face, it still stays on.  I&#x27;m quite fair and this is the only product the sun can&#x27;t &amp;#34;get through.&amp;#34; It reminds me of zinc oxide we used to put on our noses when at the beach all day - but without the white gooy mess. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday, it is very good ,not oily and it last for a whole day without reapply .</li>
    <li> I did try this product last summer while in Thailand from a sample handed out by a cosmetic store. It did seem then quite incredible, matt and matching my skin colour quite well. So I went ahead and ordered.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason I have not recovered the same feeling of  perfection. It is matt enough and am happy about that, but whitish and makes my face look pale unless I brush on lightly a  darker colour on my cheeks and forehead to match my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;It is nevertheless a good product considering total sunblocks are always a bit problematic, either greasy or whitish.&lt;br /&gt;The positives: apart from staying matt it seems to hold pretty well and offers strong  protection.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist.  I have another sunblock that has been very effective, but it frequently ends up migrating into my eyes and stinging like crazy until I rinse out my eyes.  I haven&#x27;t had any problem with this one causing that problem, and it seems to work well as far as sun protection goes.  My only criticisms are: that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize your skin at all, and it makes you look ghosty when you first put it on.</li>
    <li> Works great and I&#x27;m in the sun A LOT and for very long periods. Lightweight, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Only gave it 4 stars because unfortunately it&#x27;s tinted. The tint doesn&#x27;t show on your skin but when you sweat it shows on your shirt, etc. I&#x27;d love to have a non-tinted option.</li>
    <li> I have had some minor skin cancers and this product has been great protection for me..I use it every day on my face and forehead...</li>
    <li> The instructions say &amp;#34; May stain clothing&amp;#34; and I can guarantee you it will absolutely do just that. While not greasy and it has no smell, it does not soak in well enough and the tint coats every last area of clothing it touches. Even hours later. Maybe it works better for face only but am not interested in trying again.</li>
    <li> I have to use fragrance free items on my skin.  This sunblock does the job without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to get it promptly.</li>
    <li> Great base makeup with Lots of sun protection to help limit sun damage/wrinkles to your face. Very silky smooth feel and goes on easily.  You only need a small amount to cover your whole face...1/2 the size of a dime.</li>
    <li> I used to work in a skin care clinic. This is our best seller among our SPF products. This product is the one that gets easily ot of stock. You know why? Because we found out that if we put this product on our face after applying the moisturiser instead of putting make up then apply blush-on on it you will look like you had a make over with the feeling that you are not wearing any make-up at all. I&#x27;m not in anyway connected with the producer of this product, but I share it  with my friends because I get 2 benefits: skin protection and looking good on it. The additional benefit that I get from it? I make my friends happy when they use it.</li>
    <li> I used this for the ultimate protection from the ray of the sun, however&lt;br /&gt;my face doesn&#x27;t ultimate protection I end up having hyperpigmentation.</li>
    <li> These products was sent on time.&lt;br /&gt;They are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;They can protect your skin as well and its not sticky.</li>
    <li> BEST Sunscreen on the Planet.. A little goes a long way.. And a great price too.</li>
    <li> This sunblock is very light and non-greasy, nice light tint. Dont have to reapply very often. Works great as a base for make-up</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with what it is supposed to accomplish.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Not greasy and it does the job.  Spent hours at the beach and didn&#x27;t need to reapply every hour.  Keep one in my golf bag as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It&#x27;s a bit thick going on, but it does the job.  I use it primarily on my face where I&#x27;ve had some sun damage.  It was first recommended to me by my plastic surgeon.  I&#x27;m off to Hawaii, and have purchased extra to bring with me.</li>
    <li> I used this product while on vacation.  I did not burn, but ruined a new white top due to the color of the product rubbing off my neck onto my clothes.  I have used bleach trying to remove the stain but was not able to do so.  An hour after the product was applied, I wiped my brow with a towel because I was sweating and the  towel was also stained.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is just what I wanted. Good texture. Replaced my pricey moisturizer. I live in AZ and need a strong protection.</li>
    <li> works well, blends nicely. I like that its slightly tinted and a little goes a long way. I buy a lot from this bran but started with the face mineral fusion when skiing and like this size for my arms and legs hiking. Also does not irritate my baby&#x27;s skin if i forget to bring the foam one for him.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen......doesn&#x27;t leave the white sticky coating like many others I have used.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing TRUE mineral (offers longer more extensive UVA and UVB protection) sun protectant, with NO smell, and a light to medium weight texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a perfect product, if it was listed as tinted. Though some may like a tint, the tint is quite opaque compared to a tinted moisturizer, and a fair color at that- I found myself only using it on my arms and chest as I do not like much coverage on my face, and I found it gave a &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a lighter, scent free SPF that truly works, this is the one for you. I advise getting an untinted version, as this one has quite a bit of pigment to it and may discourage the liberal application needed to assure maximum SPF benefits.</li>
