      <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
      <li>With continued use, my nails were longer and more beautiful and healthy looking than in years.</li>
      <li>I guess sometimes you have to pay more for quality.</li>

      <li>, the tip will become more resistant to breakage...</li>
      <li>I tried using a top coat more often, but that did not help.</li>
      <li>I keep mine in the fridge to prevent this making sure the lids sealed tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bring my own bottle of Qtica on the rare visits to the nail salon and have them just put one coat of Qtica on my fingernails (no base or top coat needed).</li>
      <li>I have continued to use it for soft flaky nails that break easily and it works great.....</li>
      <li>It is so easy to apply and dries immediately.</li>
      <li>it was delivered very quickly.  </li>
      <li>My nails are so strong because of it.</li>
      <li>I stopped some years ago but had to accept my nails would never be strong or shapely, owing to the long-term damage done.</li>
      <li>This product is very good nails that are dry and splitting mails.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the absolute best product that I have ever used for my natural nails.</li>
      <li>Your nails grow quickly without breaking.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth almost $20.</li>
      <li>Reasonably effective if used regularly.</li>
      <li>I ended up trying many store bought brands such as Sally Hansen that ended up not working.</li>
      <li>Just bought it on Amazon for the first time to save a couple of bucks.</li>
      <li>I do hope I continue to have positive results.</li>
      <li>I work at a job that is extremely hard on nails and with this product I have nails that look pretty good.</li>
      <li>I used to have strong nails that grew at a moderate rate, but then they started to get weaker.</li>
      <li>I bought this item months ago, I really like it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It has worked really well.</li>
      <li>It really helps me to avoid picking at my nails too.</li>
      <li>I like the product it helps my nail grow really well</li>
      <li>It really does stimulate growth, and I can trust my nails not to splinter or crack now.</li>
      <li>but other then that I would really love the product....</li>
      <li>But so far, so good!//;)</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It was recommended to me by a high end salon after I had acrylics removed.</li>
      <li>It dries instantly (yay!) and gives your nails a clean, natural sheen.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve used acrylic nails in the past and are dissappointed in how your nails are now dull and lifeless, this product will be perfect and I recommend Qtica for you as well !</li>
      <li>This product actually works and I could tell a difference in my nails within the first week or two.</li>
      <li>The first product for nails I have used that actually works.  </li>
      <li>if it is helping my nails to grow faster, as (at least so far) they continue to break very easily.</li>
      <li>And I have been searching for the \\&quot;Perfect\\&quot; product for nearly 17 years.</li>
      <li>and so far I do believe it has been helpful.  </li>
      <li>My nails don&#x27;t grow any quicker but they have gotten considerably stronger.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t really seen a difference, but everyone is different, may work on you</li>
      <li>as long as you are consistent.</li>
      <li>but my nails have not become more thick.  </li>
      <li>I bit my nails down to the quick for years.</li>
      <li>It really does what it says, at least a 1/4 inch nail growth in 14 days, it keeps them strong and flexible at the same time.</li>
      <li>Product smeels and looks like a regular clear nail polish</li>
      <li>I remove old polish and apply only ONE coat about once a week.</li>
      <li>I am hoping that as the new nail grows further and further (and quicker and quicker!)</li>
      <li>I usually put it on as a base coat and then put either Seche Vite as a top coat or a nail color first, then top coat.</li>
      <li>My nails have always grown pretty fast, just really thin.  </li>

<li> I use it as a base, top, and twice weekly coat.</li>
<li> I typically reapply it every week.</li>
<li> Typically this .5 oz bottle costs 20$+ shipping.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Remember your nails reflect what you eat and do, poor diet, not wearing gloves when using harsh cleaners and too much water make them brittle, peeling and weak.</li>
<li> The .05 oz bottle usually lasts about a year.</li>
<li> I have tried OPI products and found them to be irritating.  </li>
<li> There is a difference in my nails but nothing extremely dramatic.  </li>
<li> My nails are very, very weak, chip, flake, break, etc.  </li>
<li> This product is mediocre.</li>
<li> I have noticed that the peeling that use to happen is not as bad.  </li>
<li> , I get so frustrated with it...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using this product for years. My nails are so strong because of it. I use it as a base, top, and twice weekly coat. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Reasonably effective if used regularly.</li>
    <li> This product is very good nails that are dry and splitting mails.  I work at a job that is extremely hard on nails and with this product I have nails that look pretty good.</li>
    <li> I bit my nails down to the quick for years. I stopped some years ago but had to accept my nails would never be strong or shapely, owing to the long-term damage done. That is, until a manicurist recommended Qtica two years ago. I won&#x27;t say I have now have the best, longest, strongest nails in town - that would be exaggerating - but I would never be without my twice-weekly Qtica application. It really does stimulate growth, and I can trust my nails not to splinter or crack now. A terrific product: it does what it says on the bottle!</li>
    <li> This product is mediocre. It tends to peel when you apply multiple layers. I think drugstore products work just as well.</li>
    <li> Typically this .5 oz bottle costs 20$+ shipping. Here I only pay 19.24$ for it all. A great bargain. The product states that 1/4 nail growth will occur in 2 weeks of use. It is correct in this statement. My nails grow beautifully with it. The product when nearing the end of the bottle does tend to gum up and become sticky. I keep mine in the fridge to prevent this making sure the lids sealed tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have short nails or are attempting to grow them this is the best polish for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember your nails reflect what you eat and do, poor diet, not wearing gloves when using harsh cleaners and too much water make them brittle, peeling and weak. Try using olive oil and carrot seed oil on your nail bed and cutiles to help get your hands into beautiful shape.</li>
    <li> Works well, but when you stop, nails break</li>
    <li> The first product for nails I have used that actually works.  The splitting and breaking stopped as my nails grew out.</li>
    <li> Excellent - nails appeared healthier and stronger in about 2 weeks time.</li>
    <li> This is by far the absolute best product that I have ever used for my natural nails. And I have been searching for the \\&quot;Perfect\\&quot; product for nearly 17 years. Thank goodness I found it. It really does what it says, at least a 1/4 inch nail growth in 14 days, it keeps them strong and flexible at the same time. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like the product it helps my nail grow really well, what I don&#x27;t like is that every bottle I have purchased, when you try to open it to use the lid comes off of the brush part, and I have to keep trying till I get it open, which really sucks, I get so frustrated with it... but other then that I would really love the product....</li>
    <li> This product actually works and I could tell a difference in my nails within the first week or two. With continued use, my nails were longer and more beautiful and healthy looking than in years. If you&#x27;ve used acrylic nails in the past and are dissappointed in how your nails are now dull and lifeless, this product will be perfect and I recommend Qtica for you as well !</li>
    <li> I have used the product for 3 weeks and so far I do believe it has been helpful.  My nails are very, very weak, chip, flake, break, etc.  I have tried OPI products and found them to be irritating.  I do hope I continue to have positive results.</li>
    <li> Finally found a product that straightens and makes my nails grow.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for men and women, great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Best nail strengthener ever!!</li>
    <li> It has done nothing to reduce the breakage and peeling of my nails.</li>
    <li> like this product. helps the growth as well as inreases the strength of my nails.</li>
    <li> I used to have strong nails that grew at a moderate rate, but then they started to get weaker. My nails had the habit of tearing off at the edge which I would have to promptly cut. I tried using a top coat more often, but that did not help. I ended up trying many store bought brands such as Sally Hansen that ended up not working. I found the Qtica Nail Growth Stimulator after ordering some of the Zoya nail polishes and decided to give it a try. It has worked really well. I usually put it on as a base coat and then put either Seche Vite as a top coat or a nail color first, then top coat. I typically reapply it every week. My nails don&#x27;t grow any quicker but they have gotten considerably stronger. I don&#x27;t have to worry that they will tear anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this item months ago, I really like it. Even though it is on the pricey side, I&#x27;m glad it works. I have tried many products including Sally Hansen and it didn&#x27;t work for my nails. I guess sometimes you have to pay more for quality. This is my second time buying this product and will buy again.</li>
    <li> it was delivered very quickly.  used as a topcoat it is great.  even this use causes nail growth.  i don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle.  I purchased the product to make my nails thicker.  My nails have always grown pretty fast, just really thin.  Qtica did make them grow faster but my nails have not become more thick.  I have noticed that the peeling that use to happen is not as bad.  In the reviews people made this product seem like a miracle product.  It&#x27;s not.  There is a difference in my nails but nothing extremely dramatic.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth almost $20.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and everytime I use it regularly, my nails grow so fast and long!! This is definitely a necessity to my nail care!!</li>
    <li> This is the best nail product I have come across. It was recommended to me by a high end salon after I had acrylics removed. I have continued to use it for soft flaky nails that break easily and it works great.....as long as you are consistent.</li>
    <li> Product smeels and looks like a regular clear nail polish product.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, after being used, it loks like a regular nail polish applied to the nails.&lt;br /&gt;It seals and protect your nails.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! I ordered three more!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t really seen a difference, but everyone is different, may work on you</li>
    <li> This product is incredible. Your nails grow quickly without breaking. I use it alone or as an undercoat. It is so easy to apply and dries immediately.</li>
    <li> I have been using Qtica on my nails for years now. Just bought it on Amazon for the first time to save a couple of bucks. The .05 oz bottle usually lasts about a year. I remove old polish and apply only ONE coat about once a week. It dries instantly (yay!) and gives your nails a clean, natural sheen. Perfect for saving money on manicures. I bring my own bottle of Qtica on the rare visits to the nail salon and have them just put one coat of Qtica on my fingernails (no base or top coat needed). It really helps me to avoid picking at my nails too. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product seems to have improved the condition (-- well, I should probably say the APPEARANCE) of my dry, brittle nails. I can&#x27;t tell yet if it is helping my nails to grow faster, as (at least so far) they continue to break very easily. I am hoping that as the new nail grows further and further (and quicker and quicker!), the tip will become more resistant to breakage... but I&#x27;ll have to use this product longer in order to say whether that is the case.</li>
    <li> This worked when nothing else would. Dries in seconds, and made my nails stronger and they grew within a week! This is an eco-conscious company and their products do not contain too toxic ingredients. BTW, the key active ingredient here is garlic. The small bottle will last you forever....</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used for my nails.  Promotes growth and strengthens nails.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product... I don&#x27;t know how it work just yet... But so far, so good!//;)</li>
    <li> Does not stay as well as the previous bottle did and think if the ingredients are the same it should.</li>
