      <li>These are amazing!</li>
      <li>No redness does not hurt easy to use and great result !!!</li>
      <li>I have never had good luck extracting blackheads, and was hoping that this product would be my miracle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to find a really good blackhead remover and came across Skinmiso.</li>
      <li>My nose was almost perfectly blackhead free.</li>
      <li>Honestly this stuff works amazing..</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>The serum at the end is amazing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It causes the blackheads to come out on their own.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I have never had a face routine product that has worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>This product however is one of a kind and almost miraculous.</li>
      <li>You want to make sure that you own (or if not to purchase when you&#x27;re purchasing this)</li>
      <li>I f*cking love science&amp;#34; a paged i liked on there.</li>
      <li>but sure does a pretty darn good job!</li>
      <li>I was able to wipe some away and extract many more.</li>
      <li>I was discouraged, but glad I kept using them.</li>
      <li>Everything is okay</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been pleased.</li>
      <li>each use, my nose looks better.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The instructions say you can use a cotton swab but squeezing or a comodone remover works better.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more than that to come out, but I finished all 3 steps, and</li>
      <li>The pores do come clean rather easily, and it&#x27;s a gratifying process if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing.</li>
      <li>and there but this product by far is the most successful blackhead remover I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
      <li>I do recommend having a blemish tool, though, which you can easily purchase at a drug store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is pretty effective.</li>
      <li>* sheets are very effective in opening/closing the pores &amp; easy to use, however I found the mechanical extraction is what actually removes the blackhead.</li>
      <li>It does make a difference in how smooth your nose looks.</li>
      <li>:) I suggest patience for anyone whose nose is stubborn like mine, because it was well worth it.</li>
      <li>I bought this product on a lark, and I think that if you suffer from (or are just plain bothered) by blackheads on your nose, this product is excellent.</li>
      <li>The nose feels clean &amp; smooth</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this and the price is absolutely amazing for what it does.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it tho!</li>
      <li>my pores so clean.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think this works any better than Biore Pore Strips.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s not painful.</li>
      <li>I have used it consistently and my nose feels so clean and blackhead/whitehead free.</li>
      <li>Thus, I decided to try the pack on my boyfriend, and lo and behold, his nose was noticeably more clear!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it because it comes with 10 weeks of strips.</li>
      <li>My skin was shinny and clear, I couldn&#x27;t be any more happier with it and will def order another pack once this one is over, especially from LUCKY since they were great from the second</li>
      <li>The three step process is so much easier on your skin than peel away strips, and is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>You do have to keep using this other wise</li>
      <li>(i.e. see some of the blackheads come out when removing the first strip).  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to continue using the product over the course of several days/weeks just to be sure.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I found something that clears out the gunk in my pores in a non-invasive way.  </li>
      <li>although the first time I tried it</li>
      <li>and there was no difference when I tried clearing out my pores after the first step.</li>
      <li>The product demos I seen make it seem like your pores should ooze all of the gunk out with the first step, and it does not.</li>
      <li>Like where has this been my whole life!?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty self explanatory.</li>
      <li>My first try with the product, I was AMAZED.</li>
      <li>Really clears out pores!</li>
      <li>the 1st use my blackheads looked almost non existent, the next morning most of them look like they had returned.</li>
      <li>The third step (which is supposed to prevent your pores from getting reclogged) smells exactly like Witch Hazel (which many people use to keep their skin clear)...might just want to pick up a bottle of that.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal!</li>
      <li>I saw a difference my first try.</li>
      <li>This product must be actual magic because I never thought blackheads could be gently removed like this product does.</li>
      <li>It really does ONLY work on the top of your nose and that is it.</li>
      <li>Initially I was  skeptical of the  Skinmiso pack because it had such great reviews and the pictures of the product working looked too good to be true.</li>
      <li>but this did work well for large pores.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really have a lot of whiteheads</li>
      <li>thanks 👌</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot come out</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to get rid of their blackheads.</li>
      <li>It really did work</li>
      <li>no irritating adhesives</li>
      <li>, it was really well prepared from shipping.</li>
      <li>Skinmiso is the real deal..</li>
      <li>After a total of 3 tries in 3 weeks, I have found noticeable improvement, and am very glad that I decided to continue the treatment.</li>
      <li>Guarantee to clean that deep pore gunk out your nose..</li>
      <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was NOT compensated for this review, I paid full price and am NOT getting ANY sort of discount on future purchases.</li>
      <li>It left my nose so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I was disappointed when I didn&#x27;t see perfect results the first time I completed the steps, however I decided that because of all the glowing reviews the problem lay in my nose being hopeless, rather than me wasting my money on yet another ineffective product.</li>
      <li>I have bought yet again a product that delivers no real results due to an abundance of good reviews</li>
      <li>It really does just dissolved my black heads and keeps my nose clean for about a week.</li>
      <li>After my first use of step one, my blackheads were clearly above the surface of the pore.</li>
      <li>After using the first nose mask, the blackheads all come out and can simply be removed.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>After the first step only one pore purged out excess sebum which was sort of a bummer.</li>
      <li>Unlike other pore strips like Biore or face wash that doesnt clean well, this one did the trick.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely clear your blackheads</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sorry to be a downer but this did nothing for extracting anything out of my pores. I tried it twice and there was no difference when I tried clearing out my pores after the first step. Maybe I got a bad batch but I definitely would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This product basically cures the blackhead issue.  Unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Initially I was  skeptical of the  Skinmiso pack because it had such great reviews and the pictures of the product working looked too good to be true. Thankfully, I was proven completely wrong. I can honestly say that I have never had a face routine product that has worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note, it does not come with the blackhead remover tool so you will have to purchase that separate (but it&#x27;s only a $2 item).</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I use it with a blackhead extractor and they work well together. It won&#x27;t take you a lot of time to extract all those blackheads compare to use the extractor alone. Also, it&#x27;s not painful. I&#x27;m a sensitive skin type and this pack does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Used the product for three weeks, and can say this works no better than a pore strip. The product demos I seen make it seem like your pores should ooze all of the gunk out with the first step, and it does not. Maybe my pores are stubborn, but now I use the second strips to close my pores after using a pore strip from Biore.</li>
    <li> Omg it actually works! I&#x27;ve seen YouTube videos on how to use this and it&#x27;s crazy. All the nasty little things in your nose just comes out with a little squeeze after using step 1. My nose was almost perfectly blackhead free. I say almost because there are still some stubborn ones here and there but this product by far is the most successful blackhead remover I&#x27;ve ever seen. The second step closes your pores up and the third step is a mattifying cream and helps soothe skin irritation after all that squeezing. The instructions say you can use a cotton swab but squeezing or a comodone remover works better. After a week using this, blackheads start to form and it&#x27;s just about that time to use it again. Definitely worth it because it comes with 10 weeks of strips.</li>
    <li> shocked and amazed! It really did work I was not sure even after reading all the reviews. I actually saw this on my FB feed under &amp;#34; I f*cking love science&amp;#34; a paged i liked on there. So i looked it up on Amazon and it actually worked! It really does ONLY work on the top of your nose and that is it. You do have to keep using this other wise it does look like the blackheads come back.. Totally worth it tho!</li>
    <li> I tried this on myself and my boyfriend. I have never had good luck extracting blackheads, and was hoping that this product would be my miracle. I was disappointed when I didn&#x27;t see perfect results the first time I completed the steps, however I decided that because of all the glowing reviews the problem lay in my nose being hopeless, rather than me wasting my money on yet another ineffective product. Thus, I decided to try the pack on my boyfriend, and lo and behold, his nose was noticeably more clear! This gave me enough encouragement to try again, and I noticed a change. (though still not perfect the way I wanted) After a total of 3 tries in 3 weeks, I have found noticeable improvement, and am very glad that I decided to continue the treatment. :) I suggest patience for anyone whose nose is stubborn like mine, because it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is an item I have to have for the rest of my existence!! Honestly this stuff works amazing.. Guarantee to clean that deep pore gunk out your nose.. Arigato</li>
    <li> These are amazing! Doesn&#x27;t completely clear your blackheads but sure does a pretty darn good job! I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is pretty effective. The directions are in another language so recommend You Tubing to see how to properly use and definitely get the extractor tool!</li>
    <li> really great product. Love it.; great seller too</li>
    <li> Really clears out pores! Unfortunately a few days later, pores are clogged again. Probably just my skin type though,</li>
    <li> The second step stung very badly on my face. I had to skip that step and use the essence only. Did not get a lot of blackheads out</li>
    <li> So just like other people who have review this item, it did not work on me as well as I expected it to at first. After the first step only one pore purged out excess sebum which was sort of a bummer. I was expecting more than that to come out, but I finished all 3 steps, and wow! Even though not a lot of sebum came out my pores were visibly smaller. I was seriously impressed. I tried it on my boyfriend too and his pores purged a lot of gunk and look noticeably smaller as well. So I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this for people who have deep blackheads to get out but this did work well for large pores. Also, I don&#x27;t think anyone else mentioned this, but the whole process stings a little, it&#x27;s not that bad though.</li>
    <li> Unlike other pore strips like Biore or face wash that doesnt clean well, this one did the trick. I have big pores which drives me crazy. This product really did make them smaller, and cleaned out everything.</li>
    <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks 👌</li>
    <li> The effect is not good, the cleared nose cannot last even for a day, and then turned dirty again.</li>
    <li> It looks and feels like this works however in a couple days my blackheads grow back. However I think this did work in reducing my blackheads!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product all of the way through. I use it back to back for 2 days and then Use it again when I&#x27;m feeling like my blackheads are getting noticeable. You want to make sure that you own (or if not to purchase when you&#x27;re purchasing this) a blackhead removing tool. You know.. The metal one with the two ends. It calls for it in the second step. I like having this product and am giving it 5 stars because I have nothing bad to say.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I tell my friends it&#x27;s the only thing that has gotten rid of my blackheads. It&#x27;s easier to purchase this on Amazon than on a Korean website. It arrived in a timely manner too which was great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! Your black heads literally just come out with one application!! This is the real deal! Like where has this been my whole life!? Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t use physical strength like other stripes to pull out the blackheads. After using the first nose mask, the blackheads all come out and can simply be removed.</li>
    <li> They just pull out the dirty things around my nose!</li>
    <li> This product description is misleading...I had the impression that you would initially see immediate results to some extent (i.e. see some of the blackheads come out when removing the first strip).  I don&#x27;t think it works and I didn&#x27;t want to continue using the product over the course of several days/weeks just to be sure.  So I returned it after two uses.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s like magic. idk what it&#x27;s in or how it does what it does but you just follow the steps and your whiteheads just seep out. although the first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t really have a lot of whiteheads/blackheads on my nose because I am very consistent on keeping my pores at least somewhat cleared up so I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot come out but I&#x27;m pretty sure that if you&#x27;re someone that has very dirty pores that haven&#x27;t been dealt with in a long time this product will help</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a lark, and I think that if you suffer from (or are just plain bothered) by blackheads on your nose, this product is excellent. It&#x27;s a three step process that (1) opens the pores, (2) closes the pores, and then (3) treats the area with a blurring cream. It&#x27;s pretty self explanatory. Some reviewers on here have complained that there are no english instructions, but as long as you can count to three, you&#x27;re golden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 is really the peak of the whole process, since that&#x27;s when you get to rid your nose of the black heads and any sebaceous fillings. My recommendation is to only expose half of your nose at a time so that you can keep the other side moist while you clean the pores. The pores do come clean rather easily, and it&#x27;s a gratifying process if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing. I&#x27;m using this about once every 2-3 weeks just for maintenance and I&#x27;ve been pleased. It does make a difference in how smooth your nose looks. Just be careful not to over-do it with your metal tool, or else your skin will be slightly red and angry.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would really work as well as other people said, but it makes blackheads weirdly come to the surface. It&#x27;s weird and I like it.</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews on this and not tried it yet but can&#x27;t wait to use it and see if it finally helps me get rid of the blackheads in my T zone.</li>
    <li> One of the best products out there. It causes the blackheads to come out on their own.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very wet and messy. The dripping wet pads, once on your face, eventually dry out enough so that they don&#x27;t fall off. Until they dry out they&#x27;ll fall off if you walk around. After holding still during the &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; and leaving them on for the allotted time, I was disappointed to see the strip had nothing on it.  It didn&#x27;t remove stuff from pores like a biore pad.  My face didn&#x27;t seem affected at all from the process.</li>
    <li> I bought this item not too long ago, it was shipped super fast and it made it to the USA way earlier than the expected. My first try with the product, I was AMAZED. It is GREAT,  I saw a difference my first try. My skin was shinny and clear, I couldn&#x27;t be any more happier with it and will def order another pack once this one is over, especially from LUCKY since they were great from the second I order to the second it made it here, it was really well prepared from shipping.</li>
    <li> Great results. Saw results on the first use, but to see long lasting results, use 2-3 times a week until all blackheads are cleared up. Then maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the 1st use my blackheads looked almost non existent, the next morning most of them look like they had returned. I was discouraged, but glad I kept using them. Halfway through the box it takes about a week for them to show back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was NOT compensated for this review, I paid full price and am NOT getting ANY sort of discount on future purchases. This worked for me when nothing else has. I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This product works! I am so amazed by how well it work. I have used it consistently and my nose feels so clean and blackhead/whitehead free. You can also use this product not just on your nose but in other areas. The packets have excess liquid in it and I put in on my forehead to get the blackheads out as well. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to get rid of their blackheads.</li>
    <li> Wow. This product must be actual magic because I never thought blackheads could be gently removed like this product does. I highly recommend this and the price is absolutely amazing for what it does. I do recommend having a blemish tool, though, which you can easily purchase at a drug store.</li>
    <li> I tried the Biore nose strips, as well as facial &amp;#34;Pore cleaning&amp;#34; scrubs and masks, but they never really work well. Skinmiso is the real deal..This 3 step process is like NOTHING i have ever tried. I have never felt my nose so soft and my pores so clean. Definitely youtube it if your a skeptic</li>
    <li> Its a very good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to find a really good blackhead remover and came across Skinmiso. I read all the reviews I could find and decided to give it a try. This product is great! It left my nose so smooth and soft. im on my 6th week of the 10 week pack and I have definitely seen improvement even without the tool sold separately so I can only imagine how it&#x27;d be if I had gotten it. Inexpensive and it works. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think this works any better than Biore Pore Strips. The third step (which is supposed to prevent your pores from getting reclogged) smells exactly like Witch Hazel (which many people use to keep their skin clear)...might just want to pick up a bottle of that.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand what people are raving about. I have bought yet again a product that delivers no real results due to an abundance of good reviews</li>
    <li> What a waste of money! It did not do anything at all.</li>
    <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. It does work, and results are great!</li>
    <li> The best nose pack ever ! No redness does not hurt easy to use and great result !!! Definitely recommend it !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had horrendous blackheads for as long as I can remember. After my first use of step one, my blackheads were clearly above the surface of the pore. I was able to wipe some away and extract many more. The serum at the end is amazing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With each use, my nose looks better. I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> These are mini-sheet masks. The first one opens the pores so you can remove the oil/dirt manually, the second shrinks the pores back, &amp; the 3rd step serum has a soft silky feel &amp; absorbs excess sebum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;* no irritating adhesives&lt;br /&gt;* sheets are very effective in opening/closing the pores &amp; easy to use, however I found the mechanical extraction is what actually removes the blackhead.The nose feels clean &amp; smooth&lt;br /&gt;* acceptable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;* blakhead remover tool sold separately&lt;br /&gt;* I had high expectations from all the online reviews &amp; photos, but it took me a couple of times before I actually saw siginificant difference.&lt;br /&gt;* Instructions mostly in korean, only a few english words &amp; pictures that explain the general idea &amp; how to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product delivered on time, well-packaged. would definitely recommend it to all who suffer blackheads.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I found something that clears out the gunk in my pores in a non-invasive way.  For two weeks after, my pores were smoother and looked as if they disappeared!  This is definitely something that will never leave my skin regimen.  The three step process is so much easier on your skin than peel away strips, and is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive pale/pinkish skin with red hair. I always have my nose covered in blackheads and they are almost uncontrollable. This product however is one of a kind and almost miraculous. It really does just dissolved my black heads and keeps my nose clean for about a week. There is nothing like it!</li>
    <li> Everything is okay&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
