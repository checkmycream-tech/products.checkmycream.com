      <li>Love the smell, but its a bit greasy...</li>
      <li>Its not made with a lot of the chemicals that are in most products today.</li>
      <li>I like this product because it is better for your skin and body.</li>
      <li>I get compliments on the fragrance all the time, but mostly I just love how it feels.</li>
      <li>This is more lotion like than cream based.</li>
      <li>What I like most about this product is that it feels more like a souffle than a cream.</li>
      <li>Love this cream.</li>
      <li>Before this cream I used L&#x27;occitain which I love.</li>
      <li>love the mango smell.</li>
      <li>so I love that it goes on smelling so yummy but doesn&#x27;t continue to assault my nose for hours.</li>
      <li>the smell is very orangey if that&#x27;s a smell but not over powering very nice.</li>
      <li>I saw that this had pretty good reviews for the most par</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive nose or trigger chemical headaches.  </li>
      <li>so if it&#x27;s not your favorite scent it may not be something you want to put on as it will not wear off easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this body cream for over a year now and am very pleased with its natural healing qualities as well as its nice fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Now the texture is not as smooth any more, and  it stays like a sticky film on the skin and the fragrance has change as well.</li>
      <li>And frankly I think it smells pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite body cream -- it smells WONDERFUL and moisturizes my dry skin very well.  </li>
      <li>Skin becomes smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>It smells&lt;br /&gt;absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>So, in reviewing I totally think its great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because its great for my skin, but it also smells nothing like my last jar did.</li>
      <li>Wonderful scent, moisturizes my very dry skin really well.</li>
      <li>This goes on smoothly, smells super clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I will buy more in the future for sure.</li>
      <li>This cream is super - I have tried TONS of cream in my 73 years.  </li>
      <li>It seems to have lost some of it&#x27;s amazing moisturizing qualities that I used to notice when I first found it several years ago (or maybe my skin is a lot drier), but all in all, it&#x27;s a great cream at a low cost.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this cream for anyone that needs more moisturizer than a lotion</li>
      <li>it takes care of dry skin and feels realy good</li>
      <li>It feels good on my dry skin without being greasy too.</li>
      <li>I liked the refreshing smooth fast absorbing texture of the former cream.</li>
      <li>It is a light quick absorbing cream that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky, but keeps your skin nourished all day.  </li>
      <li>A little bit of Hawaii in a jar at a great price.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it is worth the effort to try to get it fresh.  </li>
      <li>It should look like mango ice cream and have a fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Before I opened up my the new jar today I would have given easily 5+ stars.</li>
      <li>It doesnt irritate my very sensitive skin, and the fragrance isnt too strong.</li>
      <li>This would make a good little gift also.</li>
      <li>Sadly, as much as I love this stuff it has an extremely short shelf life.  </li>
      <li>A friend gave me my first jar of this body cream.</li>
      <li>Love how Alba products treat my skin, but like another reviewer I found the scent over-powering so only used it once.  </li>
      <li>My cat loves it so much he sniffs lying next to me! :)</li>
      <li>If you use it as a night cream like I do you will wake up in the morning with super soft skin!</li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate, and this thick, rich cream feels great on my skin and smells fantastic.  </li>
      <li>She has been extremely pleased with both the product and her skin, which was continually dry.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fairly strong and will stay with you throughout the entire day</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>really needs to put a &amp;#34;Use By&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It goes on creamy and absorbs fast so you never feel greasy.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I use the Papaya Mango body cream everyday and get frequent comments on how good it smells.</li>
      <li>If the first time you use it you have an old batch, Alba has probably lost a customer forever.</li>
      <li>it has a silky texture that&#x27;s not greasy, sinks into the skin easily, lasts a long time, and smells just heavenly (and the scent dissipates nicely so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any other scents or perfumes you use).</li>
      <li>Usually purchase this at whole foods and love it.</li>
      <li>This product is hard to find in my local stores, so I am very excited that it&#x27;s available via Amazon as an &amp;#34;add</li>
      <li>The price is comparable or better than what I&#x27;ve spent locally.</li>
      <li>my skin is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>Suitable for a man or a woman as the scent is subtle and not overly &amp;</li>
      <li>Like other users we notice a strong chemical smell that in 5 years of use we have never notice when purchased locally.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and it is always a hassle to find something I like and my skin too.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>but after a year, pain developed in my joints that was attributed to the prescribed ointment.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hyper sensitive to scents</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Sadly, as much as I love this stuff it has an extremely short shelf life.  You have to find it in a store so you can open it and sniff it.  It should look like mango ice cream and have a fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I have tried to purchase it online the cream is various shades of beige or even white and it has a rancid smell to it.  This includes having to return it to the manufacturer&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is worth the effort to try to get it fresh.  It has a wonderful fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive nose or trigger chemical headaches.  It is a light quick absorbing cream that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky, but keeps your skin nourished all day.  It is the only cream I have found that I can use liberally all over my body that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other scents it comes in - kukui nut and coconut milk - have stronger scents and different feel on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alba really needs to put a &amp;#34;Use By&amp;#34; date stamp on this stuff.  If the first time you use it you have an old batch, Alba has probably lost a customer forever.</li>
    <li> If you see this review trust me I&#x27;m saying this stuff makes you skin look dreamy! I love it! I&#x27;ve even used it as a facial moisturizer and woke up with tropical looking skin (no acne) and I&#x27;m prone. So, in reviewing I totally think its great.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is better for your skin and body. Its not made with a lot of the chemicals that are in most products today.</li>
    <li> I saw that this had pretty good reviews for the most par so i decided to order online instead of buy at the store.  I&#x27;m not sure if I received &amp;#34;old stock&amp;#34; but it has such a strong chemical smell that I can&#x27;t even wear it.  I put it on thinking maybe it would go away and had to wash it off after about 5 minutes.  This may not be the case with all of them, but I&#x27;m hesitant to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. Great scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of Body lotions and creams over the years, but none has stuck out like this product. It smells like a Hawaiian vacation..year round. Smells delicious and makes your skin feel so smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Usually purchase this at whole foods and love it. This has a completely different texture and scent. We are wondering if it is fake, or bad batches. Like other users we notice a strong chemical smell that in 5 years of use we have never notice when purchased locally. Also the texture is not as thick or creamy. This is more lotion like than cream based. We will go back to purchasing the real thing locally.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, moisturizes my very dry skin really well. Suitable for a man or a woman as the scent is subtle and not overly &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve never had any kind of allergic reaction even thogh my skin is very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Item as described; quickly &amp; carefully delivered. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate, and this thick, rich cream feels great on my skin and smells fantastic.  A little bit of Hawaii in a jar at a great price.  It seems to have lost some of it&#x27;s amazing moisturizing qualities that I used to notice when I first found it several years ago (or maybe my skin is a lot drier), but all in all, it&#x27;s a great cream at a low cost.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body cream ever! I look forward to using it because it&#x27;s creamy and it smells so so good. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love how Alba products treat my skin, but like another reviewer I found the scent over-powering so only used it once.  The smell is truly wonderful, but I found it way too strong and it never really dissipates - normally a good thing, but this scent just followed me all day.  Too much of a good thing.  Cut the scent by half, and you&#x27;ve got a winner.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me my first jar of this body cream. It smells&lt;br /&gt;absolutely fantastic. I ordered 2 jars for myself, one for&lt;br /&gt;my daughter and also tried several other Alba products and I&lt;br /&gt;love them all.  This would make a good little gift also.</li>
    <li> This has left my skin feeling very soft the smell is very orangey if that&#x27;s a smell but not over powering very nice.</li>
    <li> My hands are so dry so I keep this on my desk. I&#x27;m hyper sensitive to scents so I love that it goes on smelling so yummy but doesn&#x27;t continue to assault my nose for hours. It feels good on my dry skin without being greasy too.</li>
    <li> love the mango smell.</li>
    <li> i have very dry skin and live in a dry climate.  over the years, i&#x27;ve used all manner of body creams (lotions never last long enough on my skin) and had another favorite one that i used regularly up until early this year when i developed an allergy to one of the ingredients.  soon after discovering the allergy i discovered this body cream, and i&#x27;m never looking back!  it has a silky texture that&#x27;s not greasy, sinks into the skin easily, lasts a long time, and smells just heavenly (and the scent dissipates nicely so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any other scents or perfumes you use).</li>
    <li> Nice and creamy. The aroma is wonderful. Highly recommend this cream for anyone that needs more moisturizer than a lotion</li>
    <li> This body cream smells amazing! It goes on creamy and absorbs fast so you never feel greasy. It does not stain clothes if you do get some on it. The scent is yummy but not overpowering and lasts a long, long time. If you use it as a night cream like I do you will wake up in the morning with super soft skin! I highly recommend it! Your skin will be very hydrated while smelling great! My cat loves it so much he sniffs lying next to me! :)</li>
    <li> My dauhter loves this body cream.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey in the department stores so when I found it on Amazon for this price I didn&#x27;t hesitate to get it.  I will buy more in the future for sure.</li>
    <li> Love this! Very smooth and smells fantastic! Works well on ashy elbows.</li>
    <li> ..... and loved it every day! Before I opened up my the new jar today I would have given easily 5+ stars. But they not only changed the label they also changed the cream itself. I liked the refreshing smooth fast absorbing texture of the former cream. Now the texture is not as smooth any more, and  it stays like a sticky film on the skin and the fragrance has change as well. I am going to look for something else and I have to cancel my subscription. Really sad that I have to find something else - I was so happy with it. My skin is sensitive and it is always a hassle to find something I like and my skin too. By the way - the pic shows the former packing.</li>
    <li> makes me feel like i am on a island somewere it takes care of dry skin and feels realy good</li>
    <li> I tried dozens of body creams. This one works perfect. It is very light, not greasy, smells very good. Skin becomes smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I bought this while traveling and I had  to throw it away. The fragrance is terrible. I found a Jason cream Soothing aloe vera that was a great replacement.</li>
    <li> This cream is super - I have tried TONS of cream in my 73 years.  This goes on smoothly, smells super clean and fresh.  This will b my 3rd jar, so I guess you can see that I really like it.  I think you will too.</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest lotion/creams I have ever used. It doesnt irritate my very sensitive skin, and the fragrance isnt too strong. It moisturizes very well, and I use it when I want something a little more than just plain lotion.</li>
    <li> I like the softness of my skin.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but its a bit greasy...doesnt absorb well into the skin.</li>
    <li> This body cream (I would probably say it&#x27;s more like body butter) has a very thick and moisturizing consistency. The reason why I give it four stars is because of that scent,  it&#x27;s fairly strong and will stay with you throughout the entire day so if it&#x27;s not your favorite scent it may not be something you want to put on as it will not wear off easily. On the other hand if it is your favorite scent as it does have a pleasant scent, this is the perfect body cream for you.</li>
    <li> The best ever. I love this body cream!</li>
    <li> The cream looks pretty old and smell bad...</li>
    <li> Other reviews gave this high marks so I thought I would try it as a gift for my wife.  She has been extremely pleased with both the product and her skin, which was continually dry.  This product has put back moisture into her skin and made it soft.  She is very critical and if she finds a product that works for her there is little else to say. It is well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Alba body creams are fabulous!!!  This one has a great scent - makes you feel you are in Hawaii</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, she loves it! And frankly I think it smells pretty amazing. So, girls your man will love this!</li>
    <li> I gave this 3 star because I don&#x27;t like this smell.  I like alba products, but  not this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good.  It is so creamy.  I absolutely love it  best body moisturizer without a lot of toxic chemicals that I have found!</li>
    <li> Ala Botanica&#x27;s Hawaiian Papaya Mango Body Cream is an excellent lightweight moisturizer. It keeps all parts of my body properly moisturized throughout the day. What I like most about this product is that it feels more like a souffle than a cream. It sinks into my skin instantly and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy. My only criticism is the artificial fragrance - it smells more perfumey and floral rather than fruity.</li>
    <li> It works good and its smell is amazing. Love this cream. Before this cream I used L&#x27;occitain which I love. I decided to try this one and have no regrets. This one is as good as L&#x27;occitain body cream. However, this cream is cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great lotion - smells amazing and keeps skin moisturized. I use the Papaya Mango body cream everyday and get frequent comments on how good it smells.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body cream -- it smells WONDERFUL and moisturizes my dry skin very well.  This product is hard to find in my local stores, so I am very excited that it&#x27;s available via Amazon as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; item.  The price is comparable or better than what I&#x27;ve spent locally.</li>
    <li> Product was watery.  Not sure if it was frozen during delivery or an old product. Check as soon as you get it so you can return if necessary. I missed the return window.  Great price but product is subpar.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 3 or 4 years now. Nothing else compares... I get compliments on the fragrance all the time, but mostly I just love how it feels. I now have it on automatic reorder!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this body cream for over a year now and am very pleased with its natural healing qualities as well as its nice fragrance.  I randomly chose this product in desperation to find something to soothe and heal the lingering skin problems caused by a misdiagnosed case of cellulitis on my legs.  The prescribed ointment I had been using contained small amounts of cortisone and helped initially but after a year, pain developed in my joints that was attributed to the prescribed ointment.  With the Alba Botanica Papaya Mango Body Cream I experienced no unpleasant side effects, nothing but relief.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because its great for my skin, but it also smells nothing like my last jar did. It WAS a delicious scent and now it smells like cheap chemicals.</li>
    <li> THIS SMELLS DISGUSTING. BUYER BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;I had some essential oils that I mixed in that somewhat helped the smell but still it&#x27;s horrendous. Smells like deadly chemicals.</li>
    <li> Smells great my boyfriend love when I put this on</li>
