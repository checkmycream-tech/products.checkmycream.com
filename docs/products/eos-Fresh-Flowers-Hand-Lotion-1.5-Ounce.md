    <li> This smells great! Arrived quickly and fits great in my purse.</li>
    <li> It is soooo hard to find a hand lotion that isn&#x27;t all bulky in the purse--this is nice and slim and is perfect for those of us that don&#x27;t like to carry huge suitcases for purses!  The scent is really nice too, and the lotion is quality.</li>
    <li> The moisture factor is just OK--nothing special, but not terrible either. What I cannot get over is the scent-- &#x27;Fresh Flowers&#x27; smells like TOILET PAPER! No joke! Smells like I just opened a package of Charmin ... no thanks!</li>
    <li> Always love the smell of this lotion and it doesn&#x27;t leave hands feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Lotion smells great and makes my skin very soft!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about lotion, I want it to be moisturizing but not greasy. I&#x27;m very easily annoyed by greasy lotion. This is perfect. Sinks in right away and leaves your skin super smooth. Plus it smells great.</li>
    <li> Instant classic and now my go to lotion. I live in Manhattan and in the winter skin gets dry easily. This moisturizers well and it compact to carry around in different bags. It has a subtle smell that is refreshing, not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> another great scent..no problems with seller</li>
    <li> I actually bought this as a small-purchase item to round out my Subscribe and Save order this month, and wasn&#x27;t heavily invested in its quality. Turns out I love the shape of the container, which is clearly designed to slip easily into a pocket; it even fits neatly in the pocket on my dress slacks, so I can have it handy at work. The scent is nice, and the lotion is fine, if not a rave-review item itself. I&#x27;m keeping this as a regular subscription item after all. :)</li>
    <li> Great seller and a wonderful item. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love the soft and light scent of this lotion. Will definitely purchase other scent. Good moisturizer also. Leaves your skin feeling no to heavy.</li>
    <li> I have been telling everyone how great EOS products are and gave lotion and lip stuff in my Christmas presents.  Even though it&#x27;s been around for awhile, so many people haven&#x27;t noticed it before.  It smells good, makes my hands feel better and moisturized, and the container is very unique, it helps it drain to the exit so you can empty it completely.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it before, you should.  I signed up for the subscription, so I save some money on them with the 15% off and the scents vary.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Easy to find in my purse; it works for moisturizing, and the fragrance is not overwhelming. I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> Beware! This product contains formaldehyde which is toxic. &amp;#34;DMDM Hydantoin&amp;#34;.Be sure to check out the EWG website for a review of ingredients</li>
    <li> I like this item. Its so handy and smell good. I recommend this product, just put it in your purse.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!!! Super handy, fits in small bag/purse and smells so good. This is also not greasy which I really like..</li>
    <li> I honestly love this! My hands have never felt fresher, smoother, and silkier! Smell is nice and light. Is packaged tight so does not open randomly😊😊</li>
    <li> Nice lotion.  Not a very big container.  Great for purse.  I like being able to have it with me - top is secure and - so far - has not popped open in my bag!!  I gave it to my mom to try - she has bad arthritis and could not open it very easily.  I had no problem but ... think twice if you have any issues using your hands!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion because the container is durable, and reliable. It won&#x27;t open in your purse and leak everywhere. This isn&#x27;t the best lotion out there- it can be watery, and it&#x27;s not always what my skin needs...but it smells great, and is lightly moisturizing, and does well in my purse. Those 3 things are the reason I always have one of these around, because nothing is messier than lotion all over the inside of your purse. The best thing about this lotion is that the scent is pleasant and NOT over powering.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and as advertised</li>
    <li> very pleasant scent and neat packaging. Not too heavy, not oily, and makes my hands soft even after washing them once or twice.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my purse. Amazing shape! Cream is very good, makes hands soft and smells wonderfully. Bought it for my daughter too.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size to easily fit in my handbag and it&#x27;s such a cute little container even though my friends always mistake it for soap. More moisturizing than any other hand lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect in my purse and always makes my hands smell good after using the hand soap inn the public bathroom.. Will never be w/out it.</li>
    <li> Works to keep my hands soft from the winter chap. It doesn&#x27;t hurt on my sensitive skin and the scent is so pretty</li>
    <li> Very portable and so far is staying closed and clean in my purse. Many portable lotions get dirty no matter how careful you are - so far, so good with this one.  The scent is great too.  I hadn&#x27;t seen these in any local st ore before seeing them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Easily absorbed, the lotion makes my hands feel softer and moister.  It is also s great size for carrying.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it really is great cream good for you. By which is mean not filled with all the bad stuff most creams are filled with like Paraben etc. my only compliant is it&#x27;s price. I wish is was a bit cheaper for the amount that you get or that you get more ounces in a bottle for wht you play.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this hand lotion because of all the great reviews it received on youtube. I went ahead and bought 3 of them because they are quite small. I didn&#x27;t really think they were going to be as great as many had said it was but this lotion is absolutely the best moisturizing one for my hands. My hands get dry often and I&#x27;m always applying lotion but none of them worked as well as this one. The scent is very subtle but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far saying it&#x27;s unscented but it is not an overpowering smell at all. If you do want a stronger smelling hand lotion I recommend you check out the other EOS hand lotions. It&#x27;s non greasy and it is absorbed right away by your skin which is a very good thing. I think the packaging of the lotion is very cute and fits anywhere even in your pocket. It&#x27;s just the right size for carrying around with you. So why only 4 stars? The reason is the price. I think this lotion is indeed very moisturizing BUT it&#x27;s overpriced. I used to buy the 1.0oz lubriderm lotion for carrying around and that was only $1.19. I&#x27;m paying $2 more for only 0.5oz more---that&#x27;s a bit ridiculous. Overall, I think this lotion is very good but the price needs to go down.</li>
    <li> Awful, lingering smell. Doesn&#x27;t even provide enough lasting moisture to make enduring the odor worth it. Yucky! Don&#x27;t waste space in your purse or your money on this crap!</li>
    <li> smells great and very portable</li>
    <li> I absolutely love eos lotion!!  I bought it on a whim, one day, and have been faithfully using for the past three years. It works the best for my hands.  This lotion also helps to protect my skin from drying out in the winter, and year round with the large amount of hand washing that I need to do. I haven&#x27;t had chapped, cracked or dry hands since I&#x27;ve started using eos. The fresh flower scent is clean and refreshing.  It is not too strong of a scent, so I can safely use without causing my husband to have a migraine.</li>
    <li> This lotion is not too heavy nor greasy and just perfect to carry in one&#x27;s purse for emergencies. The smell is pleasurable.  I gave one to my brother to keep in his briefcase and he too loves the convenience.  Now he&#x27;s hooked on EOS too.  The container is too cute!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the blueberry lotion. I have a lot of the eos lip balms so I decided to get this too, and I am happy with my purchase. I bought this for school to carry around in my bag, and its just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This hand lotion by EOS doesn&#x27;t provide long lasting moisture, but it&#x27;s good in a pinch to carry in your bag, and the scent of this Fresh Flowers is awesome.  If it came in a large bottle I would buy it just for the fragrance!</li>
    <li> I received this lotion a few days before it was scheduled, so that&#x27;s a plus, and it smells so good and I just love it. It makes my skin so soft and the scent lasts a long time and keeps moisture in for a while. I&#x27;m definitely Buying again! This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> The fact that its was eos caught my attention. Smells really nice, however its not too hydrating. A couple of applications and your good.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for xmas since she has recently fallen in love with EOS products. I knew she had never seen the lotion so I bought her a bottle(?) of lotion along with a pack of EOS lip gloss. We tried the lotion and it goes on silky smooth! The fresh flowers smell isnt overpowering which is a plus. It left skin feeling soft, smooth, and hydrated. I liked it so much, even I might buy one of these for me to have in my car or for around the house.</li>
    <li> The lotion smells like flowers and the sent is quite strong at first but disappears in ~15-20 mins. The lotion absorbs quickly and does not leave any residue. I like it a lot and would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> it smells so great and works very well. subscribe and save is the way to go with this invaluable winter hand care item!</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate putting lotion on my hands but this lotion is perfect. There&#x27;s not a strong odor and it doesn&#x27;t feel like my hands are full of a slick mess. It&#x27;s definitely a go-to lotion for the winter months now!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It was super cheap on here and it smells amazing!! It didn&#x27;t take for it to arrive.</li>
    <li> This handy size is just right for a purse or tote bag.  It is fragrant yet not over-powering.  And best of all, leaves my hands soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth and no greasy feeling!</li>
    <li> This is a decent hand lotion.  I like it, but I don&#x27;t find it remarkable.  It&#x27;s quite similar to other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute, of course, and so far, the cap on mine has been secure.  I would feel comfortable leaving this in a purse without worrying it would get on everything.  However, because of the package shape, you can&#x27;t set this so that the lotion falls towards the bottom (like you can with hand creams in tubes with flat caps).  That makes it a little bit hard to dispense once about half the product is gone.  If you were putting it in a purse, you could control this by storing it in a side pocket, though.  The size and price of this item are great for portability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (I&#x27;ve had trouble with hand creams in the past).  I like that there are no artificial colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients list here on Amazon doesn&#x27;t match what other websites say, so I&#x27;m including an ingredients list I saw elsewhere:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Soybean Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Cocoglycerides, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Shea Butter, Cocoa Seed Butter, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Oat Kernel Extract, Corn Starch, Fragrance, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Retinyl Palmitate, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Gluconolactone, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Titanium Dioxide (Cl 77891), BHT, Phenoxyethanol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say I like this, and I&#x27;d definitely consider buying it again.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s amazing!! It smells good and works</li>
    <li> I like the smell ... Subtle scent of flowers and fresh rain ... Not overpowering at all and great in the purse or anywhere ...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This lotion made my hands feel worse with use. The lotion did not absorb into the skin quickly and once it did it was only a 1/2 hr before you needed to reapply. Then my hands felt even more dry than without the initial application.</li>
    <li> my grand -daughter real like it.</li>
    <li> Excelent product.....</li>
