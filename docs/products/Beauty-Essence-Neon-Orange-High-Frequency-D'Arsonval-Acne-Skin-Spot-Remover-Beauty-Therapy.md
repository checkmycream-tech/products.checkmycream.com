      <li>it&#x27;s worth every dollar.</li>
      <li>You should get what you order and pay for, right?</li>
      <li>I very much like this device</li>
      <li>First off...</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>but I am willing to keep using it indefinitely.</li>
      <li>so I put argan oil on face first.</li>
      <li>A very different feeling, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>I actually paid 1$ more for the skin tightening one.</li>
      <li>It worked well at first.  </li>
      <li>When we pay a cheap price for a product, they can break down easily.</li>
      <li>i hold the blub and careful insert it into the handle by rotating and pushing it in litely, like if you are screwing in a light blub.also i just use the attachment that looks like a spoon for my face and then clean it off with alcohol and use it on my leg, that way you dont have to be switching attachments.</li>
      <li>It really messes with touchscreens</li>
      <li>I am 54 young and just retired taking a break to get healthy and fit for round two in my life.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was fast and the item was as described but after using the glass mushroom and spoon  treatment attachments the metal that&#x27;s attached to the glass came off when removing it from the handle.</li>
      <li>It really removes sun spots.</li>
      <li>Took before and after photographs and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day and the glass tubes require gentle handling</li>
      <li>so you can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
      <li>I saw the Dermawand on TV, did some research online and through reviews and forums came up with this product to deliver the same effect at half the price, i was hesitant at first, but the price was so good, I couldnt pass it up.</li>
      <li>and i really like to use the high frequency .....</li>
      <li>I simply canceled the order as it hadn&#x27;t really shipped and re-ordered the product and this time it magically arrived in the proper time.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this as an alternative to continual facials.</li>
      <li>I have been doing a lot of research on high frequency machines and products for a while now.</li>
      <li>After doing some research I decided to try High Frequency as part of my skin care.</li>
      <li>Box quality can be a little bit better..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always taken care of my skin, but I started to notice some sagging on my neck and some deep laugh lines.  </li>
      <li>Just for a new product</li>
      <li>I tried many time same product from other seller</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It really removes sun spots. It&#x27;s better then any age/sun spot removal. And it helps to heal acne faster, and for the price it is worth every penny . Thanks a product that really works. :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, great tools for stimulating the skin, bringing oxygen to the pores in a fight against acne, reviving your scalps circulation with the comb attachment. A great price for a great tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use the exact same tool in our spa for anti acne treatments. It lasts long for daily professional use, so both thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the prompt delivery of this product.  It was a very nice addition to my beauty equipment.  I am very pleased with the results of the high frequency machine.  It is clearly a professional grade piece of equipment.  I will order from this company again.  Thank you :)</li>
    <li> First off... I ordered one of these through Amazon with the Prime shipping and it was not delivered in the time or even mailed. I literally had things come in from China on standard shipping that got here before it said this thing would. I contacted them and they were a brief and said it was shipped so they could do nothing (which it was not). I simply canceled the order as it hadn&#x27;t really shipped and re-ordered the product and this time it magically arrived in the proper time. So watch your tracking numbers with these, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with anything else or had Amazon not be too helpful with something so blatantly obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is great though, does everything it says it will. Obviously don&#x27;t use this while you have any other electronics or your client uses any electronics. It really messes with touchscreens and I don&#x27;t want to be the one to test it out with laptops or other expensive items. The box also is great for storing it in, really nice with foam padding and thick sides to it to protect the unit and the electrodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord length is a hair over 5ft 8in long. My device came with a few minor scuffs on the main unit (the reason for 4 stars, not 5). But it seems to work great regardless. Just for a new product it should&#x27;t have any scuffs on it, IMO.</li>
    <li> I very much like this device so I bought the acne one for myself and then I bought a &amp;#34;skin tightening&amp;#34; one for my mother. I actually paid 1$ more for the skin tightening one. They are actually the exact same thing. same model, some extensions, same box. same everything. they were even sent together. great product and it was sent in a timely manner, but I thought I was purchasing two different things.</li>
    <li> i received this item but it does not come with a detail manuel on how to use it, so i had to go online to get info open how to use it. also it only comes with a pamphlet with hardly no info and this item comes from china. however i have only used it a few times..  it does make your face plump for a while but i cant say anything more since i have only used it a few times in the last few years. you also need to be very careful when putting the blub into the handle; since they are a thin glass like a regular light blub, so they can break easily. i hold the blub and careful insert it into the handle by rotating and pushing it in litely, like if you are screwing in a light blub.also i just use the attachment that looks like a spoon for my face and then clean it off with alcohol and use it on my leg, that way you dont have to be switching attachments.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!  My pores were smaller after the first use.  I highly recommend this as an alternative to continual facials.</li>
    <li> Super cheap, I&#x27;m not an aesthetician, but does the work. Box quality can be a little bit better.. Good overall quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this device to improve blood circulation in scalp in order to make hair stronger after a stress! And it helps me very much! Also I want to notice that it is very useful to watch youtube videos, where customers give advices how to use it correctly, and also you&#x27;ll see that you shouldn&#x27;t be afraid of breaking glass parts, because they are strong enough!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I want to thank the seller for answering my questions concerning this product very quickly.</li>
    <li> It really works! The instructions are not that great, so if you know an esthetician, they will show you how to use it!</li>
    <li> I have bad acne problems and I do believe this works. It does stop the growing of the acne. The only problem is sometimes the color of the acne can darken if used too often. I usually take a break and start back when I notice the acne coming back.</li>
    <li> I had a ganglion cyst on my thumb and used this and it dissolved within three days. It feels a little strange at first, but once you get used to the little &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34;, it it fine. I don&#x27;t know how well the more expensive ones work in comparison, but this was definitely worth the little money I spent.</li>
    <li> If you have pimples, acne, adult acne, chin zits from grey hairs coming in, excema okay you get my drift, this is the best product I have bought on Amazon, EVER!</li>
    <li> love the product. love what it does . already see a difference in my skin. the only drawback was that it took so long to get to me</li>
    <li> I  just received this product and I love it! I saw a difference after just one use. I keep taking pictures to compare and to see how well it is working. It is making a difference and I&#x27;ve only used it five times. I will continue and update my post after a month.</li>
    <li> I purchased this device to use as a home treatment for a recurrent nail fungus, that I recieved in a dirty nail spa. It works amazingly well! I understand that it isn&#x27;t developed for that exact purpose, however the science is the same. Nail fungus live off moisture and warmth under the nail bed, the only way to dry out the moisture and open the fungus wall for eradication/treatment is thru high frequency laser. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t own the laser and the treatment price range is between $300 to $1000 per treatment and is moderately painful, like little fireworks exploding on the nail bed. I have been using this device for 20-30 mins a day for a week every month on the highest setting moving the wand in a clockwise rotation. I have witnessed increases blood flow to the nailbeds and gradual reduction to what now appears to be eradicated fungus in my hands and big toes on both feet. Yes it is mildly painful but amazing to observe, also it worked for me. I do not know if this is a permanent cure but I am willing to keep using it indefinitely.</li>
    <li> Meets my expectations. Feel like it could be more powerful but it&#x27;s a travel size so you can&#x27;t expect much. Good for beginning esthetician such as myself.</li>
    <li> We bought this to try as a substitute for a more expensive neon/violet wand (search it if you&#x27;re curious).  This unit puts out just enough energy to deliver a zap, but won&#x27;t be enough if you are a masochist.  I enjoy it quite a lot though!  A very different feeling, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> This product is much better than the one advertized on tv.  It is less costly, stronger frequencies and has different tips to use.  Seems to be working; will know when I have it longer.</li>
    <li> This zit zapper is great. Don&#x27;t worry that the English translation instructions make absolutely no sense, it&#x27;s easy to use and works really well. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I used this for about a month and the only thing it did for my skin is dry it out.  It did not help with acne whatsoever.  If anything I broke out more than usual during the month I was using this product.</li>
    <li> It worked well at first.  But it lost the power in two weeks.  I followed all the rules, but it just stopped working.  Again, it is true that we pay for services.  When we pay a cheap price for a product, they can break down easily.</li>
    <li> I am 54 young and just retired taking a break to get healthy and fit for round two in my life.  I&#x27;ve always taken care of my skin, but I started to notice some sagging on my neck and some deep laugh lines.  After doing some research I decided to try High Frequency as part of my skin care. I received it on 7/19/13 and have had 4 treatments, I am in awe of the results my face, neck and eyes look nice and lifted.  I took some photos and sent them to my daughters and asked them what they thought, they both say the results are amazing.  I am happy with my purchase and it is worth every penny.  The only down side is that it does not come with detailed instructions for use so I had to go online and find out how to use it.</li>
    <li> I chose 4 stars because my wife loves it and uses it every day. If I see it actually works I&#x27;d bump it to 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Great product very happy with results.</li>
    <li> Great product!  the price is good and works great</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for.  I had to replace a broken one at work, and they works just fine.</li>
    <li> I love my new machine!  I recommend this machine to every woman looking to control mild acne on their face.</li>
    <li> I like  it, feels good on the skin. Makes you feel pampered.  Fun to use along with the cream.  enjoy!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and pain free. Saw results over night. It scared me at first because of the sound but I&#x27;m used to it now.</li>
    <li> I saw the Dermawand on TV, did some research online and through reviews and forums came up with this product to deliver the same effect at half the price, i was hesitant at first, but the price was so good, I couldnt pass it up. It arrived within a few days and although the instruction booklet can be a little confusing i got my instructions online. I have noticed the difference almost immediately, my skin looks clearer, my eyes are not as puffy, i love it, and would have no hesitation to recommend it, however i think when using the instructions should be followed</li>
    <li> DID NOT REVEAL ENOUGH PERTINENT INFORMATION AND CERTAIN CLIENTELE OF PEOPLE WHO CANNOT USE THIS PRODUCT. I DID NOT KNOW THIS UNTIL I RECEIVED THE ACTUAL MERCHANDISE, AND HAD I KNOWN THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT.</li>
    <li> Just like the one spas use. Just more portable. May dry up skin so I put argan oil on face first. Kill zits before they can grow bigger.</li>
    <li> Had a scar under my eye that&#x27;s been there for year&#x27;s, and the product removed it after only 5 time use. This product has a lot help reduce the look of my eye bag&#x27;s which I suffer from badly. Will recommend to others</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive and it works just like a regular facial and body laser but after a few weeks of use it started to die while in use and also the the metal thing on the bottom of each attachment was glued using a regular glue gun which makes it easy to fall apart.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the item actually works, I&#x27;m returning it because I ordered the neon orange and received a completely different package with a violet wand. You should get what you order and pay for, right?</li>
    <li> I have been doing a lot of research on high frequency machines and products for a while now. I chose this over the DermaWand, thinking that it was a good price... if it worked. If not, then I lost some cash and learned a lesson. I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks now and I am quite stunned with the result. My skin is tighter and lifted in the mouth area... my most problem area. About 10 years seem to be gone already. For the money, I think it is a good product, it came to me much faster than expected, and in perfect condition, new, as stated.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know whether it works or it&#x27;s hocus pokus (spelling)but I&#x27;ll give it a go. I don&#x27;t use it every day and the glass tubes require gentle handling</li>
    <li> Too much of a hassle to switch out the different wands and cleaning them. I also find my wrist get tired almost immediately from using it. It is heavy in the hand and the non-ergonomic design makes it heavy after a few minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t really address if it works because I&#x27;ve given up doing it on a regular basis because of above said reasons. I do smell the ozone  but other than make me drier I haven&#x27;t experienced anything positive. Not sure if it works for pimples but trying that again because I&#x27;m too lazy to return the product. Can&#x27; tell the difference between the highest and lowest settings and doesn&#x27;t seem to work on a scale in between either.Like other reviewers have mentioned, the box it came in had poor instruction and didn&#x27;t look new, though the product seemed to be. Perhaps a refurbished but they claim it to be new?&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product. Orange light</li>
    <li> I tried many time same product from other seller and I had to returned it every time, because bad condicion, defect on products or after couple used they stoped working.  This seller has the best Quality ever, and believe me I&#x27;m so picky when I give my review.  Buy it is worth it.</li>
    <li> It was broken when it arrived so i did not get to use it:(</li>
    <li> I like this product&lt;br /&gt;It works for my skin and my daughters skin too</li>
    <li> Im an esthetician and i really like to use the high frequency ..... Honestly I dont have the chance to try this equipment because Im away with differency currency so also I couldnt try yet if is working or not until the end of this month.</li>
    <li> This thing started working as advertised great initially and then died 9 days after the date I can return it.</li>
    <li> When I received it there was a big piece of tape slapped across the box to keep it closed.  The box looked like is had been through a hurricane and every glass tool was broken.  It looked like a complete joke. The only reason I bought from this person was because they had good ratings.  I&#x27;ll NEVER go by that again.  I can&#x27;t believe someone would even send something out like that.  Oh and not to mention there were no instructions. Shame on you!!</li>
    <li> It came broke. A couple of the glass attachments were busted up. Why wouldn&#x27;t you check your product before you send it out. Completely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this.  I used it faithfully twice a day for several weeks.  Took before and after photographs and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, however, the glass electrode did not fit into the handle. The area of the handle where the eletrode is placed appeared to be missing.  I returned the product. The company said that part of the handle was not missing, and the electrode had to be pushed harder into the area.  I didn&#x27;t attempt to force a delicate glass tube into a small space that was too small for the glass tube. I requested a refund.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast and the item was as described but after using the glass mushroom and spoon  treatment attachments the metal that&#x27;s attached to the glass came off when removing it from the handle. I took some super glue I had and re glued the metal part back on. After attaching these and removing from the hand piece it hasn&#x27;t come off since. Quick easy repair.</li>
    <li> i will be forever young....lol...i saw the really expensive one on tv and wanted to try and get rid of this turkey neck i developed since turning 40. this is great. love this. turkey neck gone! and when i had a long night out i use it on my eyes and voila i look refreshed. i did come with one of the attachments cracked. so i purchased another for only around $6. good stuff!</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Very handy and easy to use.  Works wonder on my skin, specially the areas with large pores have improved tremendously.  My skin looks fresher and tight.  I use it every other day with my night cream.  I do not regret buying this product... it&#x27;s worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> This item arrived at my house with a broken, glass attachment.  The product&#x27;s box was not even enclosed in cellophane.  I firmly, believe that is was another consumer&#x27;s castoff.  I&#x27;m waiting on a replacement.  We&#x27;ll see how that one goes.</li>
