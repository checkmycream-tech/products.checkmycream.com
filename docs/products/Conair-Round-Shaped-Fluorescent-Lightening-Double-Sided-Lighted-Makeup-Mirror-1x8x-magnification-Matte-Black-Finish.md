<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice! I had it for two years now and still works. The zoom lens is nice and clear!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. The magnifying side is kind of scary since you can actually see your pores and all those other things on your face that you wish were not there. It really is great when you need to work on your face.</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter who is 19 and loves to spend time putting on makeup.  she really thinks the mirror is great and i think it looks good too.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely piece to have on display in my bathroom.  The light works well and is the right height to use while seated.  It makes my morning routine a bit more relaxing.</li>
    <li> This is heavy duty. Love the style and quality. Would have given it 5 stars but I dint care for the switch being on the cord instead of on the mirror, and I am not fond of the color of the light itself. I use mine in my dressing table which has great lighting, so don&#x27;t use the light much. I love the height of this mirror, no bending or trying to prop it up on something. I would but this again, great style, and quality.</li>
    <li> This product is COMPLETELY worth the money.  I have tiny blonde eyebrows that I have never been able to see in a mirror, and I can FINALLY pull those suckers out due to he high def-ness of this mirror. I also do my hair in this mirror, and I was nervous that it would not be big enough to see my massive amounts of curls. But it&#x27;s far better than any oval mirror I have used. Going to buy one for my mom because she&#x27;s so impressed with it. Also, it&#x27;s utterly beautiful and something you feel proud to have on your dressing table. Cannot recommend it enough, and I swear I do not work for Conair!! Lol</li>
    <li> I looked for quite a while before making this purchase and read a ton of reviews.  I love this mirror and it is very stylish and is of good quality.  The lighting is very well and does put out enough good quality of light.  Definately recommend this if anyone is looking for one!</li>
    <li> This mirror is amazing! Everything about it is perfect! I found flaws and pores on my face that I never knew I had!!! It is now a pleasure for me to do my makeup because I a perfectionist and this mirror lets me see EVERYTHING! The light is nice and bright. Very sleek matte black design.  You can in the picture I added the difference between a regular mirror and this one. In addition the seller was AMAZINGGGGG!!! I initially recieved the wrong mirror and contact Amazon. Amazon reached out to the seller and within a few hours I already had my new tracking number with the correct mirror on the way...and all this was on Christmas Eve! Love love love! Excellent customer service! Excellent ship! Excellent Everything! I will DEFINITELY be buying again from this buyer.</li>
    <li> I thought for the money it was a nice little mirror, looks good, a little different and stylish, time will tell</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my daughter. she loves it and it fits perfectly on her dresser</li>
    <li> The light burned out very quickly and there is no way to replace it. I called Conair and the customer service person advised me to just purchase a new one. This product is very expensive. I highly recommend that you do not purchase this mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic mirror for a great price. Definitely bright enough in my completely dark room in the winter.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a lighted makeup mirror. Found this at a good price, and it&#x27;s not your typical design. Works well, and looks good.</li>
    <li> I looked for a while for a mirror that was not only cute but functional. This one is perfect. I have it on my vanity and use it almost daily for applying makeup and doing eyebrows! It was a little bit bigger than I had imagined but that just helps to see more of my face at one time. The lighting is great and really helps out the lower level of magnification. Overall I love this mirror and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this mirror a couple times and already it&#x27;s my favorite vanity mirror ever. The mirror itself is great, it&#x27;s crystal-clear and the perfect size, and the magnification is really handy. The light isn&#x27;t as bright as I was expecting, but it&#x27;s adequate and natural, especially when used with another light source. What really makes this a five-star item, though, is the design. It&#x27;s unique and gorgeous. Love it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful mirror, lighting is good, magnification is good for plucking eyebrows.  I would have given it 5 stars if switch was on the base and it had a receptacle to plug in a curling iron/flat iron.</li>
    <li> It looks nice. I like the double sided convenience.</li>
    <li> Product is just as pictured. Puts of perfect natural light. Mirror is sturdy and well build.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  It is beautiful.  The light works great!  It magnifies almost too well! Lol!  You can see all of your imperfections!  I can now put my eye liner on perfectly!  I wanted one that plugged in because all of my battery powered ones lose juice way too quickly.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about that!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Beautiful!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many cheap plastic lighted make-up mirrors in the past, but this metal one is, without a doubt, the classiest!  It&#x27;s simple and beautiful and is a great addition to my vanity table.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s got a bit if a unique flair while being the functional mirror I needed. And at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for about 2 months now and I love it. It has a large surface area, the light works great and it is very pretty (as far as mirrors go.)&lt;br /&gt; Extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I looked at a lot of mirrors before finding this.  It was cheaper than most, so I was skeptical, but the design was more interesting so I took a chance.  I loved it from the beginning and am still happy with this purchase. It&#x27;s larger than it appears, sturdy, functional, and looks beautiful on my bathroom sink. Thanks for providing me with an alternate to all the other boring mirror at a decent price!</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!  Very attractive mirror, the magnification side is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is also nice and bright, something that was sorely lacking in my prior mirror.</li>
    <li> I needed a new mirror with more magnification to compensate for my increasingly poor vision, and this is perfect!  Not sure I love seeing all the imperfections, but I asked for it!  It is tall, but doesn&#x27;t take up as much space as my Ott-lite.  It is visually better because of the open design.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this vanity lamp use it every day and all my girlfirends ask me where I got it who see it...</li>
    <li> 8x is TOO much magnification. It requires me to be VERY close to the mirror. Sending it back. Now I know what 8x is.</li>
    <li> I like the design of the mirror.  The height is great.  I don&#x27;t have to hunch down anymore to put on make up.  The magnification is a little high, so you have to be really close to the mirror to see anything, but it works fine for me.  The lighting is good.  There was a scratch across one side of the mirror, but I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of exchanging it, so I just kept it.  It is a small scratch that doesn&#x27;t really affect my view.  Overall, I would say this is a pretty good mirror for the price.</li>
    <li> The magnification is higher than most magnified mirrors. The light (only one setting) is bright. You&#x27;ll see stuff on your face that you didn&#x27;t know was there! Very pretty on a vanity. Cord is black and non obtrusive. Comes with a click on/off switch about 6 inches from the light, so you&#x27;re not having to hunt for the switch. I love this mirror. You will too..</li>
    <li> I just gave this away to someone who liked its decorative look because honestly, that&#x27;s really all it&#x27;s good for - neither the light nor the magnification is powerful enough despite the high price. My little handheld 15x magnifier does a better job.</li>
    <li> But lovely.  It is very pretty and the mirror is great.  I wish the light was a little brighter - but that seems to be the case with most makeup mirrors.</li>
    <li> The mirror is larger than I thought, but looks really nice -- love the style.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the lighting, but that&#x27;s OK.  The magnified side works.  You do have to be so close you&#x27;re practically touching the mirror, but that works for me because after my cataract surgery I can&#x27;t see anything clearly up close without reading classes and this magnifies large enough so I can see what I&#x27;m doing while appying my make-up.</li>
    <li> I love the shape because it&#x27;s so unique. So far it works great for all my needs! I mostly use it to apply my makeup and the light is very useful so seeing things in great detail! The only drawback, but this is with all magnifying glasses I think, is that you have to get really close or things get blurry.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my girlfriend who was using a vanity mirror with a poor quality light.  I purchased another mirror at first, but it just lit up (it didn&#x27;t project light or anything) so I returned it and purchased this one.  Of course it costs a little more than the rest, but is totally worth it.  She says she loves the two different magnification modes and the light is BRIGHT.  I asked her if it was even too bright (as I saw it and noticed how very, very bright the lights were) and she said it was perfect.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s been using the mirror for nearly a year now. She says she has noticed no problem with either the intermittent connection when rotating the mirror (to use one side or the other), nor with the rotary line-cord switch. I still find the rotary line-cord switch a bit wonky, but it continues to work. All-in-all, wife LIKES the mirror, SO guess it deserves a &amp;#34;4&amp;#34;.    Received early April, 2014.  There seems to be a faulty connection between the frame/ base of the light and the mirror portion of the mirror which includes the lamp. In order to get the lamp to come on one needs to rotate mirror back and forth a bit. I am afraid the connection will fail all together soon. I do not like the rotary switch in the line cord (much better if it were a fixed rocker switch in the base), but that is not the issue at present.  I do not see anything here on Amazon&#x27;s site about a guarantee, but in any case, by the time one ships and pays for return ship, it hardly seems worth it.  I got this for my wife, and she likes it, OTHER than this issue described. She says its good for plucking hair and the light level (when it works) is adequate for that. (Her face is right close up to the mirror for this.) In a dark room though, using the non-magnified side of the mirror to apply make up, however, the light level could be brighter. The height and appearance are fine.  All-in-all, a satisfactory mirror BUT FOR the intermittent electrical connection to the lamp and the rotary cord switch.</li>
    <li> This is a great purchase, it works well and it does everything it said it would do. It was a present and my girlfriend loved it; defiantly something to buy!!!</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I envisioned that it would be. I needed a magnifying mirror for my vanity and a chrome mirror just wouldn&#x27;t fit in. I also didn&#x27;t want to spend a boatload of money. This mirror fit all my specifications. I love the way it looks and the magnification is perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good 10x magnifying mirror, and great for applying make-up.  It&#x27;s just too tall.  I would have been better off purchasing one of Conair&#x27;s less decorative models without the ornate stand.</li>
    <li> But no half star option.  The mirror is really pretty and the light is bright and clear, but it&#x27;s just too bright.  The halo casts shadows on my face unless I am close enough to the mirror.  At that distance, the light is too close to my face and it washes out the color a bit.  So, my make up looks fine in this mirror, but too dark in different lighting.  The light is great for the magnification side--you&#x27;ll find pores you didn&#x27;t know you had!  Lighting is tricky with make-up mirrors and I have yet to find one that is &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34;  This one is definitely better than most and I bought it because of the reviews about the light, but I was still a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> Some reviews of this aren&#x27;t great because people say it&#x27;s not that bright or too small. However, with a vanity of this size, you&#x27;re expected to get very close to it. I absolutely love this because it casts a natural light and with the duel sides, I can really see everything. It&#x27;s also great for my dorm room, because it&#x27;s not so bright that it will wake up my roommate and I can get ready wherever I want. I love this. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, but the magnification was so enlarged I could not see in it. Sorry had to return it. Will keep looking for another one. Thanks Amazon...</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my teenage daughter and was a huge it.  Much cuter than a lot of the other mirrors.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very bright, looks nice, and is the perfect magnification for eyebrow maintenance/makeup application. Lasts well too, metal is durable.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase.  The light makes it easy too apply make up .  I wiish the switch was not on the cord.</li>
    <li> The best mirror I have ever owned.  GREATI have owned a lot of mirrors putting on my makeu and thiis is the best ever.</li>
    <li> This product is probably the best I could have hoped for! I even bought one for my mom as a birthday present WE LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> Love this so much! I use it everyday when getting ready! Magnified side is the perfect up close mirror. Lights are great too. Perfect for applying makeup</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this mirror. It is far superior to the previous mirror I used for the past 10 years. Great magnification.&lt;br /&gt;And it matches my fixtures in my master bath!</li>
    <li> Really nice mirror. I am very pleased with the amount of light and the magnification. It is plastic but looks and feels like metal. This is a good purchase and I would recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! The light on it is great and the mirror itself is very pretty. I never used a &amp;#34;vanity&amp;#34; mirror before and used just the bathroom mirror but now I won&#x27;t go back! It lets you see a ton of detail so you don&#x27;t ever miss any un-blended makeup!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!  Love it&#x27;s unique form and the color as I am not a chrome kind of girl!  It has performed well and I have had it several months!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I really wanted a 10 power like I&#x27;ve seen at department stores - this is so much better, especially for the price. I can see my actual pores and the very fine eyebrow hairs. My eyebrows have never looked better.</li>
    <li> I love the classy metal vine shaped stand, mirror light on/off switch on the cord, the flat base that can hold small items and not let them roll off, also the brightness and clarity of the blub provides excellent view of unwanted facial hairs etc…  .</li>
    <li> This mirror is great, love the style of it and I&#x27;m doing a much better job doing my make up now :).</li>
    <li> The mirror has a very distinctive style and works perfectly. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchase, I have not seen one like it anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Though my daughter did purchase one similar from a resale shop at of course a much lower price than mine.&lt;br /&gt;Note: it is fluorescent and produces white light, it is stated that it is lifetime bulb, oh yes we shall see?</li>
    <li> This mirror exceeded my expectations especially after reading some of the reviews.  It is most definitely bright enough.  I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would want it brighter...unless you like to squint while looking in the mirror. The magnification is too good, I see things I wish I couldn&#x27;t.  :)  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product, what we were expecting, the light could be a little brighter, but still does the job.</li>
    <li> Just got this today but I think it&#x27;s perfect this far. Light is not too bright and not too dim. Mirror is very pretty and looks great in my bathroom on my vanity!</li>
    <li> This mirror is larger than I expected, but I LOVE it! Came in quickly and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Ordered this because I needed a mirror to put my make-up on. Works as expected. Nice design too! Glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted for a reasonable price ..</li>
    <li> Perfect mirror, looks good, great light .</li>
    <li> Clear light, not yellow like some, so it mimics daylight better, I think. I use it for makeup and for grossing myself out by magnifying my pores.</li>
    <li> The light is definitely bright enough and it fits my needs perfectly. I also really like the design. I have to admit Amazon return service was amazing, the first mirror I received was scratched on the edges and I received a new one within two days! I also didn&#x27;t have to pay anything to return the faulty one! 8x magnification is great for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price.  Bought for grandmother for mothers day,.. She absolutely loves it.  That is enough for me to give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror.  HUGE magnification compared to my old mirror.  I hope it lasts as long as my previous Conair mirror.  Looks great on my dressing table as a compliment to my Hollywood girl vanity mirror.</li>
    <li> Looks good on my vanity table--very stylish.  Magnifies well.</li>
    <li> Great service and I love the product.  I looks great and is very functional.  Price and service was fantastic.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The Conair Flourescent Mirror is a disappointment.  I was attracted to it because of the style and the fact that it lights up.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t light up well at all.  There is a ring of light around the mirror, but it shines very little light onto my face, even when I&#x27;m up close.  It just glows.  Also, the mirror itself is pretty small considering the size and weight of the product.  It takes up more space than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> the size is just right.  the light is more than adequate, it can&#x27;t be the only light source in any room.  the switch  close to the top of the cord is a good feature.</li>
    <li> Conair light up fluorescent mirror has a beautiful design with a very bright light to see your face light up! Love the big round mirror &amp; on/off switch in the cord. The price &amp; free ship was amazing, Amazon.com ROCKS!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mirror for my vanity and tried so many others that weren&#x27;t bright enough, or tall enough, or pretty enough. I decided to try this one because of the reviews and I am very happy that I did. The design is beautiful and the light is so bright and perfect for applying makeup or tweezing my eyebrows. It looks great on my vanity table and it stands at the perfect height for me.</li>
    <li> It looks fabulous on my counter! The mirrors are perfect, I love the amount of magnification (hello pores). The light isn&#x27;t super crazy bright, which I like. I don&#x27;t know what the complainers are looking at or why they need surgical lighting to see it? I use this thing to pluck my eyebrows and apply eye makeup - it works great for these things. If you need a lighted mirror for normal use, this is great :)</li>
    <li> Love this style I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and still works great also easy to keep clean</li>
    <li> This mirror is beautiful and functions perfectly! It has a day side and a night side for different makeup techniques. The magnification is flawless and the lighting is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror for my wife as a Christmas gift and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Quality product and good value.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone in need of a lighted mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for her birthday to replace the broken one she had and she loved it! I loved the design of this one which is why I chose it. I knew she would like it. The lighting was really nice,  plenty of it! The magnification side was perfect as well. Nothing bad to say about this mirror, I definitely would recommend it to anyone looking for a new fluorescent mirror.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered. Great style and design. Mirrors work great. Lighting is perfect and is very bright. I am happy that I chose this one out of all the others that I looked at.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for a great price! Works great and looks great! Highly recommend purchasing this product if you are looking for one!</li>
    <li> Read lots of reviews and did lots of shopping online before deciding on this mirror and I am sooooo happy that I did! It looks perfect with my room décor and the vanity it sits on. It is the right height for my vanity and swivels to the magnifying side easily. The light is exactly what I wanted and is very bright but I don&#x27;t feel it is too bright. It allows me to see to get my makeup on evenly and when on the magnified side, allows me to see perfectly around my eyes to get my liner and mascara on without smudges, etc. (I wear glasses so the magnification is exactly what I was looking for. Granted, it is a strong magnification, and allows you to see EVERYTHING, but the bright side is, now I can do something about what I see before everyone else sees it too!) The switch for the light is located on the cord and not the base of the mirror, but it is conveniently located and not difficult to hide when not needed. The mirror itself could have been a little wider in diameter to make hair styling easier, but other than that .... its perfect for me! Very happy! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Nice mirror.  Light is good and works well both regular and magnified.  Looks like metal but is plastic all around.</li>
    <li> Nice unique design. Brighter light than many others I have seen in the store (B B &amp; B) nice color</li>
    <li> I use it everyday! Before I just had a regular magnifying mirror, but I gotta say love how bright the light is on it.</li>
    <li> i love this mirror so much. it is way bigger than i expected. which is nice. very beautiful design especialy on my black vanity that i also ordered off amazon. would recommend</li>
    <li> The lighting is so great for my dark room. I can put makeup on while my husband sleeps. Great product</li>
    <li> Glad I ordered this! It&#x27;s very nice looking for a mirror and the light is good for me. I&#x27;m 34 yrs old and I feel like the magnifying part meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It&#x27;s functional and really cute!  I think the lighting is perfect not lacking like other reviews reported.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> It died after one year. It was attractive and very nice while it lasted. One year later the light stopped working. I tried to find away to take it apart to replace the light, but could never get it apart. I will be buying another brand next time hoping to get more than one year for the price.</li>
    <li> Fashionable, and classy..... Love this vanity mirror.</li>
    <li> Beter than expected. The light works perfect for my daugther who loves make up!</li>
    <li> This was given to my daughter for Christmas. She is a make up aficionado and loves this mirror.  It is very pretty n feminine and has a bright light. The magnification on both sides is great as well.  I am purchasing 2 more for myself n my daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> The matte finish and simple, yet stylish design enable this product to look good on a small table in an alcove of my office - freeing up the bathroom for ablutions.&lt;br /&gt;The magnification is a bit of overkill but is still usable - and useful if you have really bad eyesight.&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement would be to have the on/off switch on the base itself rather than on the cord. However, this does keep the base design simple with clean lines.&lt;br /&gt;I find the amount of light output to be more than adequate.</li>
    <li> Okay, so it&#x27;s really NOT a dressing table, it&#x27;s an old antique desk that I just use as a dressing table, and this mirror looks great on it.</li>
    <li> Wife said It really works well to apply her makeup, she loves to look of it on her vanity. Conair is going toward all LED now, getting away from fluorescent lights for there mirrors.</li>
    <li> The description states that the mirror may be removed from the base and operated with batteries as a travel mirror.  I contacted Conair when I received the mirror and couldn&#x27;t find any reference to this.  The description is not true.  It is a plug-in only.  Also the mirror is very tall, taller than I expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered this conair mirror after my older mirror got a short in it and would no longer work.  It is very pretty and the light is nice and bright.  The magnification side is great too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading so many amazing reviews, but, as soon as I plugged it in the bulb popped. Very disappointed. I&#x27;m in Australia so I can&#x27;t even ship it back without it costing a fortune. So now I just have a plain mirror.</li>
    <li> I love how steady it is, the light helps to see every little detail on your face. I love it.</li>
    <li> While the light is pretty bright in your eyes, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make applying makeup etc any easier, at least for me.  the light doesn&#x27;t really shine on your face. But the mirror itself is a beautiful design, and is nice and tall.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror because it had a unique design and had the basic things I needed.I have had make-up mirrors since I was 14 ~now that I&#x27;m 55 all I need is basic.It looks great on my vanity and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.The lighting is good....however, the magnified side takes a little getting used to (REALLY CLOSE UP !!). HA ! HA !  The only downside is that the on &amp; off switch was on the cord and not the base. Bottom line~ I love my mirror and would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wish the on/off button was on the base than the cord other than than great product</li>
    <li> Great lighting, love the brightness and the magnification. I&#x27;ve had this almost a month now and I&#x27;m really happy with it and glad I picked this mirror over some of the competitors. Does exactly what I wanted and is decorative on top of being functional. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister as a birthday gift It&#x27;s a very sharp looking mirror but like some of the other reviewers complained the florescent light IS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Mirror has no distortion and is unique in design.  The magnification is perfect.  I would highly recommend this mirror to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for months for a pretty mirror that was reasonably priced and bright.  As soon as I received this mirror I plugged it in and was amazed at how great the magnification was and how bright the light was!!  Wish the on/off switch was on the base instead of the cord but this mirror is wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! Would have given it 5 stars had the mirror it self been a little larger. It looks great on my black granite vanity!</li>
    <li> Love it, just what I was looking for.  Just what I need without unnecessary features.  I like the flair the design has.  The little curves allow a place to keep necklaces, rubber bands, whatever.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good quality lighted make-up mirror with magnification literally for years. I love this mirror. It seems to be distortion free, is a good size for putting on make-up and plucking eyebrows. The base is very sturdy and the mirror frame and design are very attractive. I also feel the price is fair. Amazon&#x27;s vast selection obviously helped me finally find the mirror that fit my needs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this 14 months ago. The light no longer turns on. Consider that you might have to replace the entire unit after only a year of use like me. The one I had previous lasted for YEARS. The light never went out &amp; I replaced just for aesthetic reasons. I also noticed I paid about $40 &amp; now they&#x27;ve jacked the price up to $50. That&#x27;s quite an increase in a short amount of time. 😳 Knowing what I know now, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT*  After a cooling of period &amp; buying another vanity mirror that I hated &amp; returned, I&#x27;m back. I ate crow &amp; called the Conair 1-800 number (after a failed trip to Bed-Bath-&amp; Beyond) &amp; paid for them to ship me a replacement light for (appx $18) that took 10 days to arrive (I&#x27;m west coast). But, gosh darn it, I do like this friggin&#x27; light. The light is bright. You can see reality, the light I returned had 5 star ratings also but had &amp;#34;fantasy&amp;#34; lighting. You looked good but I want to see the issues so I can remedy them before I go out in public. The magnify is strong- perfect for mascara application. Solid mirror. Just be prepared to have to order the replacement bulb.</li>
    <li> This mirror only got 3 stars due to the lighting.  I specifically purchased this mirror for the bright lighting.  Not so bright.  You have to be very close to the mirror to get the effects of the lighting.  Not as bright as I thought it would be.  The zoom on the flip side is ridiculous.  You have to be practically face to face to the mirror to see on this side, but you will see every blemish once you can focus.  Great for applying mascara.</li>
    <li> i love this mirror and its pretty! I think its perfect for anyone who needs a make up mirror. thanks</li>
    <li> This is just simply awesome!!! Beautiful and unique and the magnified mirror is just amazing! You see absolutely everything even more then you thought you could see. I just absolutely LOVE THIS. Worth every Cent :)</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST makeup mirror ever! Get this with the fluorescent lights, it&#x27;s bright and the design is beautiful. Love the ability to have both regular and enlarged mirrors. Wonderful price too. My old mirror fell apart; it cost over 100. bucks 15 years ago! This is much nicer and so much more affordable. I was going to get that other one again, but they now offer only one design and it&#x27;s very colonial, ie, ugly looking and not my style. This is the same technology for more than half the price, plus it has 2 mirrors not just one. Love it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful mirror, nice light. But often at times it will not turn on. I barely had it that long when it started doing that.</li>
    <li> I spent a long time in search of the perfect makeup mirror and THIS is it! I loved that it was unique and the light is nice and bright!!! I did not even think I would even use the magnifing side but it cimes in so handy. If you are not sure, buy it...it is a perfect mirror.  Looks so pretty and is definately a great mirror and is has a great price. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
