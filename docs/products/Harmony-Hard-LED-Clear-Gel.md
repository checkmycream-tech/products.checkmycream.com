      <li>Because this is not carried locally it is good to know that I never need to be without since it ships</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and looks great</li>
      <li>There are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to use this product and do your own gel manicures.</li>
      <li>You can create your own gel nails with this and dual nail forms, which I also ordered from amazon.</li>
      <li>and now I do my own fill ins.</li>
      <li>IBD is definitely better if you are looking for an all around good Gel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Gelish products and this one has been very good so far.</li>
      <li>This is supposed to FILE OFF and not be able to SOAK OFF.</li>

      <li>That said, it does make my nails incredibly strong without needing acrylics.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with clean nails----use the very fine buffer sponge and lightly buff your nails in a downward motion from cuticle to free edge.</li>

      <li>It self-levels easily and quickly.  </li>

      <li>Yes it&#x27;s worth every dang penny!</li>
      <li>Even if you still insist on natural nails, this gel makes for a strong protector on top of them.</li>

      <li>Why pay big bucks for gel nails when you can make your own?  </li>
      <li>in an hour take n push the cotton side to side and it slides right off.</li>
      <li>but it does soak right off within an hour, just like the soak off gel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To paint just lightly buff with the sponge, use your foundation and color coats like normal.</li>

      <li>I like the builder gel better - this is harder to get to self level and smooth out IMO...</li>
      <li>Works really well under gelish soak off gels too!</li>
      <li>It never fails me and I can always count on whatever I use, working.  </li>
      <li>The first day i did my nails, something just seemed off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the actual product from the company but figured I could get a better deal here.</li>
      <li>This gel isn&#x27;t really all that shinny.</li>
      <li>Like the pink, I wasnt able to figure this stuff out.  </li>
      <li>so fast thanks to amazon.</li>
      <li>Yup, went to get SOG off, and my whole nail melted.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t be sure what results you&#x27;ll have with other lights.</li>
      <li>It is better used over acrylic/Gel to encapsulate beads, slices, and other decorative items.</li>
      <li>this point the form should release cleanly from the nail and you are left with a shiny nail.</li>

      <li>Unlike some of the more expensive brands I find gelish brand is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have experienced some lifting along the back edge after 1 week, but I apply some nail glue and press it back down and it lasts for another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve watched Youtube videos of people doing these nails with other lights and their instructions didn&#x27;t work with my light or they used much longer</li>
      <li>this was was not a hard polish like it states.</li>
      <li>I usually use more than 2 layers of it to build it up</li>
      <li>I use this to (encapulate 3d items and regular polish, cover rhinestones, and outstanding for doing snake skin nails with any other gel</li>
      <li>: Make sure it&#x27;s the hard builder and not structure&lt;</li>
      <li>If you peel the product off without using acetone remover to dissolve the gel, you will pull a layer of your natural nail off with it.</li>
      <li>No mixing and no harsh smells.</li>
      <li>I fixed it, I&#x27;m on day 3 and RNP as well as SOG will not stay on the nail.</li>
      <li>I wasted more than this costs, buying lesser quality lights.</li>
      <li>An LED light is required to set the hard gel.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s where I do something I have not seen in any other how to: put the finger back under the light (now minus the dual form) and cure another 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Trim</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Came broken and no replacement!!</li>
    <li> This is the easiest product to use!  It self-levels easily and quickly.  I usually use more than 2 layers of it to build it up but that&#x27;s not a problem as it cures quickly under the lights and then I just quickly apply another coat. This is the 1st time in my entire life that I&#x27;ve had long fingernails!  My nails are so thin that they bend backwards several times and then just tear off.  I&#x27;ve purchased this product 3 times and I&#x27;ll keep coming back as long as they continue to sell it!</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff!  You can create your own gel nails with this and dual nail forms, which I also ordered from amazon. Why pay big bucks for gel nails when you can make your own?  Even if you still insist on natural nails, this gel makes for a strong protector on top of them. Because this is not carried locally it is good to know that I never need to be without since it ships so fast thanks to amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is THICK and gloppy. The online tutorials make it look like nail polish going on. It is NOT. That said, it does make my nails incredibly strong without needing acrylics.</li>
    <li> I use this to make my nails longer, read below for how I do it. This method works for me with my equipment, your mileage may vary!&lt;br /&gt;I love this gel, it is self-leveling and I get smooth results!  This is HARD GEL, if you want something to just give your nails a little hardness then you can use STRUCTURE GEL.....it&#x27;s softer. I&#x27;ll do a review on that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had acrylic nails lately and they were a thick mess. Rather than go back and have them further butchered I bought this gel and now I do my own fill ins. Yes you can use this gel to do fill ins over acrylic nails! When the acrylics pop off (because that&#x27;s how schitty a job the tech did) I just replace them with a dual form gel nail and they are slender and pretty and look like my own nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I use and how I do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*GELISH  18G LED LIGHT: Yes it&#x27;s expensive. Yes it&#x27;s worth every dang penny! I wasted more than this costs, buying lesser quality lights. It works with every single gel polish I&#x27;ve tried. It never fails me and I can always count on whatever I use, working.  My instructions are based on my light and I can&#x27;t be sure what results you&#x27;ll have with other lights. I&#x27;ve watched Youtube videos of people doing these nails with other lights and their instructions didn&#x27;t work with my light or they used much longer times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*HARMONY PRO BOND: Yes you want this instead of just the PH Bond. Don&#x27;t try to sub alcohol or acetone for this. Just buy it. It&#x27;s cheap and it lasts forever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DUAL FORMS: I got the 100 pcs for about $5, I&#x27;ll try to put a link in my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*HARMONY HARD LED BUILDER GEL: Make sure it&#x27;s the hard builder and not structure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*#6 nail brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Gelish Foundation coat (what you use for doing the colored gel polish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Very fine buffer square&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting with clean nails----use the very fine buffer sponge and lightly buff your nails in a downward motion from cuticle to free edge. Just enough to take off shine. Wipe with alcohol then dab on Pro Bond. Let dry.&lt;br /&gt;Apply a thin coat of Gelish Foundation coat, cure 5 seconds in Gelish light.&lt;br /&gt;Select the dual forms that fit best on your natural nails---make sure they fit from side to side, edge to edge, without overlapping or having a gap. File to fit if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;One nail at a time, paint a light coating of Builder Gel inside the dual form. Place inside your light and cure 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Paint another light coating of the builder gel inside the nail. Fit the nail to your finger and press gently--don&#x27;t make the gel squish out. Make sure there are no bubbles under the form. Place the finger under the light and cure 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Remove finger from light, grab form at end with tabs and gently work it side to side to remove the dual form from the nail. If the form is not damaged you can put it back in your box and use it again.&lt;br /&gt;At this point the form should release cleanly from the nail and you are left with a shiny nail. It may be soft-ish. That&#x27;s where I do something I have not seen in any other how to: put the finger back under the light (now minus the dual form) and cure another 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Trim nail to desired length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To paint just lightly buff with the sponge, use your foundation and color coats like normal.

    <li> this was was not a hard polish like it states. I did not like it at all. not a good product for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Gelish products and this one has been very good so far. I just wish all Gelish products weren&#x27;t so expensive. No complaints about the product itself though!</li>
    <li> Rather than go to the salon to get gel (powder) nails with plastic tips or a gel manicure, I use this hard gel to add thickness to my natural nail surface.  I also use a paper form to build an extension if I want to make my nails all the same length. I do not have to use artificial nails, only this hard gel. I usually apply gel polish over them because this gel is crystal clear, so you see your natural nail underneath the surface. I have experienced some lifting along the back edge after 1 week, but I apply some nail glue and press it back down and it lasts for another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This hard gel bonds to your natural nail. If you peel the product off without using acetone remover to dissolve the gel, you will pull a layer of your natural nail off with it. (DON&#x27;T DO IT!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to save money and has the time and the talent to paint their own nails. An LED light is required to set the hard gel. These lamps are available on Amazon. There are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to use this product and do your own gel manicures. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Went on easy and stayed on well. Will definitely continue using. Works really well under gelish soak off gels too!</li>
    <li> I like the builder gel better - this is harder to get to self level and smooth out IMO...plus it doesn&#x27;t feel as hard when cured.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. I am not for sure if I like it or not.  I think it will take some getting use to.</li>
    <li> I need to figure out how to keep it from lifting from my nail. Its so aggravating. It doesn&#x27;t break, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my nails and I find that to be soo annoying.</li>
    <li> Like the pink, I wasnt able to figure this stuff out.  I have since given up on doing my nails after spending hundreds of dollars on stuff like this.  I am stupid.</li>
    <li> Using a gel brush you apply and build your nails with ease. No mixing and no harsh smells. Works great with Gelish 18g led lamp.</li>

I&#x27;m not hard on them and all I did was press a button on the remote and 1 nail went flying. I fixed it, I&#x27;m on day 3 and RNP as well as SOG will not stay on the nail. I am now missing 4 nails and I&#x27;d rather chop the rest off rather than go through this BS again. Fake product!</li>
    <li> This gel isn&#x27;t really all that shinny. I have to use a top coat with it. For a gelish brand product I was disaponted</li>
    <li> This product is not good for a regular gel nail. It is better used over acrylic/Gel to encapsulate beads, slices, and other decorative items. IBD is definitely better if you are looking for an all around good Gel. But like i said, this isnt a bad product, just not meant for nail application.</li>
    <li> This will make your nails strong and can be use on top of the structure coats then apply nail color.</li>
    <li> I love this gel. It&#x27;s perfect for extra thickness n building a new nail if you break one. It does take a little longer to get off but it does soak right off within an hour, just like the soak off gel. The soak off gel only takes 10 to 20 minutes, the hard gel takes an hour. I keep the cotton soaked in acetone, being careful not to let the cotton dry out, in an hour take n push the cotton side to side and it slides right off.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I use it as a last layer over my gel polishes to add extra shine and protection over my gelish polished nails.</li>
    <li> Unlike some of the more expensive brands I find gelish brand is my favorite. For the non builders (thinner viscosity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use this to (encapulate 3d items and regular polish, cover rhinestones, and outstanding for doing snake skin nails with any other gel polish)&lt;br /&gt;Great product,</li>
    <li> I bought the whole line for hard gel and they don&#x27;t last.  Lift easily, break easily, crack easily.  Don&#x27;t like this at all...going back to IBD</li>
    <li> I love this product. Easy to use and looks great</li>
</ol>
