### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This works great for me!  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the best way I can describe it; they don&#x27;t look as they did in the beginning.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>For those of you who have issues with  nair after the hair removal try using the epilstop perfect finish neutralizing after wash.  </li>
      <li>I have recommended this to my best friend and she loved it ^^</li>
      <li>I LOVED that product.  </li>
      <li>and I LOVED this.  </li>
      <li>Been using this for many years now.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but it sure doesn&#x27;t smell like a rose.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I work with many hairy men and would prefer to look like them rather than deal with this inconvience of uncontrollable itch and pain and irritation.</li>
      <li>It smells really strong - doesn&#x27;t make your skin smell at all</li>
      <li>I did as directed, and I have fine blond hair on my legs.</li>
      <li>Good for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>, I have no doubt it would&#x27;ve been totally smooth.</li>
      <li>This nair was fantastic.</li>
      <li>You can tell when it&#x27;s ready to come off because the hairs look kind of melty.</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>You know, the one that dries quickly</li>
      <li>Its so gentle and leaves my legs nice and soft!</li>
      <li>Pleased overall.</li>
      <li>Stinks but its the best hair removal ever made..</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to those that dislike shaving.</li>
      <li>However, the test I used was to pull one hair (not yank it out, just give it a gentle tug) and when several hairs and the goop come off, it&#x27;s ready.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and cannot shave my legs.</li>
      <li>I only paid $5.35 total, but of course it wasn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
      <li>It works really well, though I do like to keep it on for as long as I can</li>
      <li>If you open at least one window, the smell dissipates pretty quickly too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;sort of a messy process, but still worth it.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be a good alternative to shaving whereas I am often in places where shaving my legs is impossible.</li>

<li> I did use it on my legs and it seemed to work decently, but I did see a little irritation on them as well.</li>

<li> The hair no longer grows back as thick or as fast.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t want to risk the burns others mentioned, so I took it off a little early.</li>
<li> Nair Silky Sensation is a product that is hard to find where I live.  </li>
<li> Follow the instructions carefully</li>
<li> Also, if the cream gets on other parts of the skin by accident you will be burned there as well.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair remover products.  </li>
<li> It is as smelly as regular Nair, but there is less of a mess because it is so thick.  </li>
<li> I put this on my underarms and holy cow did it burn!</li>
<li> This product takes about 3-10 minutes to leave the skin with less hair and smooth/soft to the touch.  </li>
<li> Do NOT buy this, it is a waste of money.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not to harsh on the skin.  </li>
<li> They were sore for a few days after and putting deodorant on felt like fire.</li>
<li> Will continue to use, though it smells pretty bad.</li>
<li> The smell wasn&#x27;t harsh and it worked in minutes!</li>
<li> the product smells really horrible, sort of like eggs, but leaves the skin completely smooth and hairless .&lt;br</li>
<li> and I has a patch missing!!</li>
<li> For some reason it is very hard to find in stores...</li>
<li> Stinks so bad can&#x27;t use it.</li>
<li> Burned so bad</li>
<li> Very disappointed</li>
<li> This is the worst thing I have ever tried.  </li>
<li> And with the horrible smell comes a burning sensation even after you have rinsed all of it off.</li>
<li> This product smells so disgusting and it doesn&#x27;t even work unless I leave it on over 10 minutes, and if you have stubble on your legs</li>

    <li> Stinks but its the best hair removal ever made..</li>
    <li> It works really well, though I do like to keep it on for as long as I can (w/out exceeding the recommended time to leave it on your skin). I love how it makes my skin baby soft and smooth. Follow the instructions carefully (e.g. you wipe it off in one motion, do not rub it because it will irritate your skin). It smells really strong - doesn&#x27;t make your skin smell at all but you will want to air out your bathroom when using a lot of this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have recommended this to my best friend and she loved it ^^ I&#x27;ve tried other hair remover products.  But I needed to try something else since Sally Hansen removed their Brazilian wax.  You know, the one that dries quickly and you just pull the wax off by hand without wax strips?  I LOVED that product.  But it&#x27;s gone now.  So, I was looking for something else.  I remembered Nair&#x27;s commercials from back when I was a teenager and decided to try this.  and I LOVED this.  and it&#x27;s not to harsh on the skin.  But I MUST warn you.  PLEASE FOLLOW DIRECTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No joke! Me and my friend both left it on too long and regretted it.  So, I am not kidding you.  PLEASE FOLLOW directions or you might end up burning your skin off.</li>
    <li> Nair Silky Sensation is a product that is hard to find where I live.  This product takes about 3-10 minutes to leave the skin with less hair and smooth/soft to the touch.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For those of you who have issues with  nair after the hair removal try using the epilstop perfect finish neutralizing after wash.  It works to combat irritation, burning and redness after the hair removal. I no longer have these issues since using epilstop.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This product smells so disgusting and it doesn&#x27;t even work unless I leave it on over 10 minutes, and if you have stubble on your legs there&#x27;s no hope for this stuff getting rid of it.</li>
    <li> This nair was fantastic. The smell wasn&#x27;t harsh and it worked in minutes! I highly recommend it to those that dislike shaving.</li>
    <li> All you have to do is smear on a layer and let it sit. I set two timers, one for 3 minutes (minimum) and one for 10 minutes (maximum). You can tell when it&#x27;s ready to come off because the hairs look kind of melty. That&#x27;s the best way I can describe it; they don&#x27;t look as they did in the beginning. However, the test I used was to pull one hair (not yank it out, just give it a gentle tug) and when several hairs and the goop come off, it&#x27;s ready. I didn&#x27;t want to risk the burns others mentioned, so I took it off a little early. It went from 3/4 inch hairs to maybe the day after shaving! Had I left it on a minute longer, I have no doubt it would&#x27;ve been totally smooth. Will continue to use, though it smells pretty bad. It&#x27;s not horrible, but it sure doesn&#x27;t smell like a rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 10 months of using it 1-2 times per month on underarms has resulted in noticeable changes. The hair no longer grows back as thick or as fast. Not only are the individual hairs thinner, the growth is sparser. In case it&#x27;s unclear, thinner hair, slower rate of growth. Skin does not appear affected. If you open at least one window, the smell dissipates pretty quickly too. Pleased overall.</li>
    <li> I put this on my underarms and holy cow did it burn! They were sore for a few days after and putting deodorant on felt like fire. I did use it on my legs and it seemed to work decently, but I did see a little irritation on them as well. I probably won&#x27;t be buying this ever again.</li>
    <li> Stinks so bad can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This is the worst thing I have ever tried.  It smells like rotten eggs. It also doesn&#x27;t remove all of the hair.  You have to leave in on for way longer than 3 minutes otherwise it won&#x27;t do anything.  Do NOT buy this, it is a waste of money.  And with the horrible smell comes a burning sensation even after you have rinsed all of it off.</li>
    <li> the product smells really horrible, sort of like eggs, but leaves the skin completely smooth and hairless .&lt;br /&gt;sort of a messy process, but still worth it.</li>
    <li> I never use this stuff, and now I know why. It never works. I did as directed, and I have fine blond hair on my legs. It took nothing off and left me smelling and feeling gross. Very disappointed and I won&#x27;t buy again. I only paid $5.35 total, but of course it wasn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
    <li> My legs are covered in chemical burns! I thought this would be a good alternative to shaving whereas I am often in places where shaving my legs is impossible. I work with many hairy men and would prefer to look like them rather than deal with this inconvience of uncontrollable itch and pain and irritation. Also, if the cream gets on other parts of the skin by accident you will be burned there as well.</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin! Beware of where you run this though because it will take off hair! Accidentally got some on my arm arm hairs and I has a patch missing!! Been using this for many years now. RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and cannot shave my legs. This is the ONLY product that works for me! Its so gentle and leaves my legs nice and soft! For some reason it is very hard to find in stores...so I order it on here. Try it...and you&#x27;ll never go back to shaving!</li>
    <li> Threw it away. Burned so bad</li>
    <li> This works great for me!  I only use it on my under-arms, and there has not been any irritation.  It is as smelly as regular Nair, but there is less of a mess because it is so thick.  I&#x27;m switching from the Nair baby powder to this.</li>
