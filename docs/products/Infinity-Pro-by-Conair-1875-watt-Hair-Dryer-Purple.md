      <li>This product dries very quickly and I love the heat and power options.  </li>
      <li>The blow dryer itself is powerful and effective.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So originally I had purchased a  Andis 75370 Tourmaline Ionic/Ceramic 1875 Watt Hair Dryer last year. The dryer was um, well I didn&#x27;t like it that much. Too make matters worse, the attachment began falling off with the slightest touch. That becomes very annoying since my hair is so thick.... Anyways, I received this dryer on Saturday which was the day it was supposed to arrive. I had missed the delivery, but I was so anxious to get it that I went to FedEx and picked it up. I ordered this along with the Denman Brushes Thermo Straightening Brush (D79) . So I am Black and I have 4b natural hair. I had been trying to straighten my hair for the longest. I also recently purchased a Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium 1.5-inch Steam Styler off of overstock.com, which I like way better than the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch I also purchased last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the whole point is, I really like this hair dryer so far. I wish I could have got the blue one but it cost almost $11 for shipping which made it not worth it. The color is very vibrant. O yea the main thing is, the dryer dries my hair very quickly. The cord moves with you and was a fairly good length. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer...I use it when on the road or at the gym.  I like the powerful yet quiet air blast it emits (when compared to a previously owned Conair that died)...this is definitely an improvement and I recommend this effective product.</li>
    <li> Great dryer.  Nice heating controls, average weight.  I have had it for a few months and have been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. Blows hard &amp; dries my medium long, fairly thick hair dry in 3 minutes. Love it!!!! Would definitely recommend this for any type hair.</li>
    <li> I like how much air and heat this hairdryer puts out. I have a ton of hair that takes ages to dry, but that time is much shorter with this hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that I wish the cord was longer! My old hairdryer had a much longer cord and I was spoiled by it.</li>
    <li> I bought this Conair Infinity 1875 watt hair dryer after reading all of the positive reviews but was very disappointed. It works ok for the price but does not make my hair any shinier than cheaper dryers. In addition, the buttons are placed on the handle of the Conair dryer in awkward spots so I kept pushing the buttons by mistake while holding it in one hand and trying to use a brush in the other. This resulted in the temperature getting too cold several times during the process. In addition, I found this hair dryer to be a bit heavy after a few minutes so I had to put it down to rest my arm a few times. Lastly, even at the highest temp, the air flow wasn&#x27;t hot enough to dry my hair quickly. I had to keep going over and over the same spots and there were a few parts of my hair that started to dry in its natural state before I could get the hair dryer to that section because the dryer wasn&#x27;t drying the other parts of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be that my curly-kinky shoulder-length hair is just too much for this dryer. I would have given this Infinity Pro hair dryer only 1 star but it was inexpensive enough that I guess it&#x27;s okay for the price. I keep it as a back up but have invested in a more expensive professional grade hair dryer so I can get the results I need.</li>
    <li> i am a woman of color and i have to say i am very, very impressed with this dryer.  rarely can i just buy a product like this one that actually works on my hair (especially when i have to do it myself and i have a very nice grade of hair).  it get really hot and actually drys the roots and straightens my hair.  i wish i could say that for the numerous curling irons i&#x27;ve bought.  the one &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; i have is that if you are not proficient in drying your own hair with this type of dryer you can get burned and you should take your jewelry off. i suggest you get some kind of attachment to put on the dryer to assist in drying your hair.</li>
    <li> Previously I owned the pearl 1875 dryer made by Remmington which was great. Your hair gets silky straight and the drying time was magnificent. As for CONAIR, I do not achieve the same results. My hair felt very dry after use of this and it was pouffy! Then I went to pick things up in my local Wal-Mart and what do I spot? The same exact dryer $6 cheaper! Will not purchase again. Actually I&#x27;m giving it away to repurchase my Pearl! The only reason I purchased this because Remmington went up on the price and my friends dog chewed through the wire of my old 1.</li>
    <li> Low speed is not very low.  It blows away my hair.  Had to go back to old hair dryer.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I also have a Jilbere Tourmaline dryer which I&#x27;ve had for about four years.  It always felt awkward and heavy then when the paint started rubbing off I decided to get a replacement.  Bought this one since it has pretty good reviews and I found it at a warehouse store for cheaper.  It weights about the same as my old Jilbere but for some reason it has a better &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; when holding it.  I generally use it about 3-4 times a week just for drying, not so much for styling since I use a flat iron for that.  I have thick hair past my shoulders and it takes about 5 minutes to get my hair dry.  I like this one, it&#x27;s fast and easy to hold.  The cord is REALLY short, only half the length of my old Jilbere but luckily my outlet is only a foot away so I have no problems with that.</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer.  Not only does it dry my hair quickly, but the three heat settings mean that I don&#x27;t have to rely on the hottest setting.  And, if you have fine hair,  it does not create static like some other hair dryers can do in cold weather.</li>
    <li> Who knew there could be such a big difference in hair dryers?  Well it&#x27;s true!  This hair dryer is SO powerful, it dries my hair much quicker than other models.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I like the light weight of this dryer and it dries my hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This only challenge I have is in the ergonomics.  I have to be conscious of where I hold the machine... otherwise I start flipping buttons on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachment also comes off very easily.  Once I find the time to go shopping in person for the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; fit, I will give this to my daughter for her apartment at school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To end this with a positive note, this dryer has a great hot temperature setting that does not over dry or burn.</li>
    <li> I was concerned with the beat up looking box, but all is well and I love this blow dryer! the color is a darker, richer purple, not like the picture, but I love the color even more than in the picture!</li>
    <li> If anyone is hesitating about whether or not to purchase this hair dryer, you&#x27;ll be sorry if you don&#x27;t get it! My hair is naturally curly, but it&#x27;s a frizzy curl so I often like to blow dry it straight. This dryer is by far the best dryer I have ever used on my hair. Not only does it dry fast, but my hair looks shiny too, and the best part is it holds all day! The only negative thing I can say about this dryer is that the function buttons are on the inside grip, so I&#x27;m constantly pushing the buttons when I&#x27;m holding the dryer, a bad design. Otherwise, I love this dryer!</li>
    <li> VERY disappointed in the reviews and descriptions here. It&#x27;s not at ALL lightweight! In fact I worked in salons with pro dryers that were lighter. It&#x27;s 2 1/2 lbs with a long nozzle. Even with long arms I had a hard time holding my arm up and out long enough to get on top of my hair. I do have bad shoulders right now so part of it is that but I will say for those who have short arms, definitely pass this one up unless you&#x27;re the type of person who dries head down dryer pointed up. Great power and visually I LOVE the color and sleek texture/design. It&#x27;s just not ideal for me. I would recommend it to someone with long strong arms/hands/wrists who uses it primarily for quick hair drying, not styling/straightening. Good price point, decent dryer, great quality, again, just not for me.</li>
    <li> I had to send this back, as was too heavy for my wrist and rotator cuff problems.  Thought it was reviewed as lightweight.  Might work out fine for other people.</li>
    <li> It gets my long hair dry in record time without drying it out!!  I love the cool down button as well.</li>
    <li> So far this hairdryer is fabulous! I noticed a difference between it and my previous one which was a very expensive Solano dryer. This Conair dryer dried my hair faster and it felt way smoother and softer after. (the only difference was the hairdryer as I used all the same hair products as before). I am very happy with it - it works great, it isn&#x27;t too heavy, and it&#x27;s a gorgeous color too! Also the price was way better than the Solano dryers and the fact that it works even better - I definitely recommend this dryer!</li>
    <li> I love the color, the drying time, the style, the temperature options, the rocker-style buttons, the feel of the grip, the length of the cord, and the fact that it is made by Conair... who knows how to make hair dryers that last a long time and a comfortable for the consumer. I can easily recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a nice one to own. As a few of the other reviewers have noted, it is a bit heavier than some hair dryers, but it is so negligible to me that I only mention it here for the purpose of information to other possible buyers. The drying time is cut in half, so you are holding the tool for half the time, so I doubt it would even present much of an issue for most users. And I am also one of those people that equates weight with quality in some products, so for me, it feels very well-made in your hand. I highly recommend this beautiful purple hair dryer to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary that works very well and is made by a reputable company.</li>
    <li> I just opened up my package which I was very excited about because of the reviews I read. Well, once I opened it I found someone&#x27;s hair all in the box and sticking to the plug stickers on the hair dryer. Also, there were scratches and dings all over the hair dryer. This was 100% used. I am totally grossed out that someone else&#x27;s hair was all over a product that I paid good money for. When someone returns something it is not right to resell it so someone else. UPS is coming to pick it back up tomorrow and I am assuming I&#x27;ll be getting a refund or at least I better. I am extremely disappointed and have never had this happen before using Amazon. Either way, I will not be buying from this seller anymore!</li>
    <li> I have the orange version of this.  I have nothing good to say about it except that the straightening nozzle stays on, but it is supposed to do that anyway!  This just simply does not get hot enough to dry hair in a reasonable amount of time, or provide any straightening benefits with a round brush.  Results on my straight wavy hair is complete frizz! I must follow up with a hot iron, which I do not need to do with most other dryers.  This has caused EXTREME damage to my hair, ever since I started using this item.  Tons of breakage.  I cannot even believe the good reviews on this.  I have used other dryers (the old Remington T-Studio for one) that are in the same price range that are far superior.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is a good hairdryer and I have no complaints with how it dries my hair.  I am a little surprised by the reviewers that have said this is a light weight hair dryer.  I find this hair dryer to be a good bit heavier than my previous Conair hair dryer that I had to replace.  The controls are easy to operate and it is even easy to change settings while drying my hair.  I love the color.  It is a pretty vibrant purple.  Overall I am happy with my purchase but I do wish it was a little lighter in weight.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not exactly lightweight, but it&#x27;s also not a compact dryer. I find the weight to be average. However, I find the warm setting to be very similar to cool when the dryer is on high. On the lower speed, it is warm. And, hot is a bit too hot.</li>
    <li> good product, relatively light weight and dry faster. I love the metallic look purple. I found it&#x27;s better to use warm temp i/o hot temp, my hair become less fuzz and more shine and smooth.</li>
    <li> Works very well and is relatively quiet.  Lightweight and easy to hold and use. Recommend for all hair types. Sleek style fits into hairdryer caddy under sink.</li>
    <li> Was concerned about purple color, but it is not bad, it is a darker purple that looks more regal than gouche. The blow dryer itself is powerful and effective. Good buy.</li>
    <li> It works well and dries my hair in a short amount of time...light weight too.  Also like that I can hang it up.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer.  MUCH lighter than my old one and dries hair great.  I like that the concentrator is included.  The intake screen in the back is removable, so I can clear out the dust that collects.</li>
    <li> Excellent in every way! Was originally concerned about replacing a professional hair dryer with this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I have this same hair dryer in the purple/pink shade, and got this for my mom as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my hair dryer for about three months now and I use it daily, and it&#x27;s still going strong. It is a powerful hair dryer, and yes, it is loud-but it has a low setting if that bothers you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see what the hype is about this dryer being really heavy as I&#x27;ve read all over the reviews; it&#x27;s not light but certainly not weighing my arm down either. It cuts my drying time literally in half, so who cares? The &#x27;cool shot&#x27; button works really well which was also a huge plus for me. This dryer has a cartridge that is very easy to remove hair from so that it won&#x27;t fail as easily. Overall, it&#x27;s a solid product and I&#x27;ve been very happy with mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: Conair will replace within four years if this breaks if you call them, which sealed the deal for me for a $30 dryer. I called and asked Conair about this directly before I purchased mine through Amazon. It doesn&#x27;t matter it&#x27;s through a third party.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer! Got this as a gift for someone and she loves it. Good power. Hot air setting hot. Cold air setting works perfect. Comfortable design. Lightweight and stylish.</li>
    <li> Who knew all hair dryers were not created equal!  Great price for a hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t fry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super thick hair and this dryer cuts my dry time in half compared to my last old cheap dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is good, great product!</li>
    <li> Very strong wind produced by this hairdryer.  Dries my hair very fast, the cool setting defrizzes my hair after the wind tunnel dry:)  I have long thick hair and I can dry it in about 6-7 mins.  Great product ordered as a replacement after my old one (same hairdryer) died.</li>
    <li> I used this dryer for the first time at a friend’s house.  It was amazing, it had the attachment on it and my hair was silky and dry within minutes.  I was so thrilled with it; I went online and bought one.  I still love it and the best part about the dryer is the warm setting.  You can dry your hair right at your scalp and not burn your head or heat up the bathroom to the point where you&#x27;re sweating!!  I highly recommend this dryer.  I have had this dryer now for 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing hair dryer! It does my hair so fast and doesn&#x27;t leave it with any static. I will buy this dryer again when I need to!</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister for Christmas because she put it in her wish list....she loved it.  She used it the next day and said it was working great.  She had wanted it because her mom had one.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is light weight, easy to use and quiet.  I love it and it&#x27;s a great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> bought this on a whim shopping at costco, I was in desperate need of a blow dryer, so anything would do. I just spent a ton of money on a vacuum, so a high end blow dryer was going to have to wait. I have to say after one use, I am very impressed. My other blow dryer was still working, but was causing my hair to frizz up horribly. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting this blow dryer to work so quickly and efficiently. My hair is smoother and more manageable. Note, I am also using salon quality shampoo and conditioner, so that helps a lot.</li>
    <li> not a fan of this dryer, it does dry my hair quickly, however it leaves my hair dry, frizzy and dull.</li>
    <li> This dryer has great power and really does help keep your hair from frizzing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great, and it has lots of power, or little, depending on the setting.</li>
    <li> The number of heat and airflow settings are exactly what I need.  The purple color is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;It uses toggle switch (instead of sliding switch) control and is very easy to change modes.  Airflow is adequate in high setting.  I expect this to last 2 - 3 years (based on my experience with Conair hair dryers).</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer!  I do understand the other reviews about the weight, but for me that is not an issue.  The last light weight dryer I bought caught on fire in my hands!  This product dries very quickly and I love the heat and power options.  Conair has never disappointed me.</li>
    <li> lightweight and fast drying, just what I wanted, excellent quality, good settings.  I like the longer cord, no need for an extension cord!</li>
    <li> No issues so far. This dryer is average weight, has good speed settings and heat settings. The color is fun.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer for my teenage daughter as a Christmas gift. I own an expensive CHI brand dryer, and she was always using mine. She really likes her new dryer and says it dries her long locks quickly. She also said it&#x27;s not very noisy when you consider the power it has.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on November 4th and on February 16th it burnt up!  My purchase was based on ConAir reputation and the fact that it has a 4 year warranty.  But it did not even last 4 months!! and because of Amazon&#x27;s return policy, I cannot return the product for a refund!! All the manufacturer will do is replace with a new one.  Why would I want a new one when this one burnt up in less than 4 months!  Don&#x27;t waste your money! Very disappointed with the hair dryer, the manufacturer and with Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have several of these hair dryers. I keep one as a back-up in case my other one breaks. It works well, puts out good heat and I love the colors.</li>
    <li> Great dryer.  Button placement could be better. I seem to accidentally turn the heat down. It works really well though!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is very nice, I have full thick hair and it will have it mostly dry in about 2 minutes, I have also managed to drop it about 20 times since I got it and its still running like a  champ.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I have very thick, long hair and it takes forever to dry. My old dryer finally died out and I was having a hard time deciding which one to get. Ended up buying one at a discount retailer in town(the one that has initials in the name), and I could have fanned my arms and made as much air as that thing put out! I brought it back and decided that I would try this one since the other Infinity styling products that I have used had been good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its great. Has a good amount of power and puts out a good amount of air. Drys my hair very quickly and I like having 3 heat settings. Good Job Again Conair!</li>
    <li> this dryer arrived in an &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; plastic bag inside the &#x27;banged up&#x27; product box.  The cord was unwrapped and stuffed willy-nilly inside the bag.  The dryer had scratches and smudges on it.  It had obviously been used and returned.  There was no instruction manual included, either.  The dryer may be a good dryer but I didn&#x27;t want to touch an obviously used personal item.  I am just appalled that such a product was sent to a customer.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is an updated version of my previous  dryer.  Being a senior with less arm and shoulder strength  I Love the lightness... I found it easier to handle because it has a shorter snout...but, It&#x27;s almost too powerful for my new short hair. Recently had to change to a shorter style and a soft perm because of some shoulder impending surgery. Now, wish it included a diffuser.  Before surgery, I used a curling brush and dryer for styling.  Can&#x27;t wait to heal and get back to pre-perm and curling brush then I&#x27;ll  really be able to use the power of this new dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Five months later.  Shoulder has healed. Perm is history! Using just curling brush and dryer, I have no problems holding this dryer over and behind my head. The dryer is easy to handle, its well balanced, but quite a strong blow for short hair...and its pretty loud! Wish it had another setting for less power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it well enough that I purchased another, at Costco, just like it to have as a spare.</li>
    <li> Loved the color, works amazingly well. Dries your hair very fast. I love that there are multiple setting for temperature and speed</li>
    <li> This dryer works better than any other I have tried in the past.  Plus it came in my favorite color, purple!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is pretty efficient. I have long hair and it dries my hair quickly on medium, I have yet to even need to put it on high so I&#x27;m sure it would be even faster at that speed. It also helps keep the frizz down as well.</li>
    <li> It is a great thing to have very neat to see for anyone who likes things like this type of thing.</li>
    <li> Light weight and very smoothing, still giving my hair body. Great color, too! Dries quickly and easy to hold and turn.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite color is purple, so this was a must have for her. The dryer works really good and looks good also.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer. Dries my hair super fast (if anything, it&#x27;s too powerful and my hair can get tangled). The hot setting dries my hair nicely, but doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp. The cool button works nice.</li>
    <li> I had two of these hair dryers at my house (one for my use and one for my guests).  Everyone that comes to the house and uses it comments on how quickly it dries hair.  I even bought a couple of these as gifts for people after they visited the house and fell in love with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  be careful not to get anything near the intake motor - we had someone get their hair tangled while trying to dry a stain on their shirt and we had to cut the hair because we couldn&#x27;t get it out!</li>
    <li> thanks to this hairdryer. Lots of air, variable temperature, light weight too. Every feature I want and need. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Bought this dryer to replace the one I have just like it that was wearing out.  I was so happy to find it still available AND in my favorite color of purple!</li>
    <li> Not only am I happy with this hairdryer, but I&#x27;ve already had a houseguest that is coveting it after using it. It has great power, is small enough to consider taking it when I travel, and was really reasonably priced. I hate to admit it, but it&#x27;s better than the $150 Italian hairdryer that I was replacing.</li>
    <li> I searched for quite a while trying to decide on a good blow dryer.  I was willing to pay a little more.  After questioning my hair stylist, checking out her equipment, looking at reviews and features of brand names across the board and sensible to outlandish prices, I settled on the Infinity Pro by Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer looks nice.  It handles well and easily - it&#x27;s a a light-weight, but not a feather-weight, which I like.  It blows a strong, soft, even flow of air that dries quickly and the cool shot works great!  My hair dries smoother and with a shine.  I am very happy with this purchase.  As for &#x27;settling&#x27; for a less expensive dryer?  I didn&#x27;t settle - I got a great product for a good price... that&#x27;s winning!  And I like to win.</li>
    <li> love it works better than the brand new chi blow dryer.  recommend it to everyone that comes into the salon</li>
