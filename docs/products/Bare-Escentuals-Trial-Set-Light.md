      <li>Goes on really nice and makes your skin look amazing.</li>
      <li>It helps to cover up any imperfections but won&#x27;t do the job on its own, so I suggest using another powder after the foundation is applied.&lt;br /&gt;Bare</li>

      <li>though I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review, I still paid for it.</li>

      <li>and it is very light and does not look like you are wearing anything.</li>
      <li>the trail set was ok  </li>
      <li>but i love the fact that it has a mini brush...</li>
      <li>The fact that comes with a brush is also a plus, takes of the hassle of finding the appropriate brush for application.</li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:d2be9b85cbb781e0bf22afa8eaf50f09]]I love</li>
      <li>Okay I&#x27;ve never tried this product before</li>
      <li>but i love it and</li>
      <li>Felt really light on my skin!</li>
      <li>but was cute.</li>
      <li>I used this more for a bronzer</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s an awesome size to keep in purse for touch ups; also, it came with a teeny tiny buki brush which I love:)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight breathable powder feels amazing on my skin.</li>
      <li>I found out real quick that I do like it.</li>
      <li>was excited to receive this in their promotional offer in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This goes on great over concealer to set the spots and blends naturally in a neutral manner.</li>
      <li>I received this item complimentary or at a reduced price for my HONEST review</li>
      <li>I actually like this trial set size wise as I can put it in my purse for when I need touch ups on the go!</li>
      <li>the packaging all says original which I feel is a better description.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smooth consistency - goes on easily and blends well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was excited to get this because I was hoping that I would be able to try out the light color on my neck.</li>
      <li>I buy many, many items from Amazon, but I think this is the first time I have ever felt ripped off by a seller in the three + years of shopping here.  </li>
      <li>In exchange for my review, I was given a huge discount on this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did order light, which is says on the tag but</li>
      <li>I bought the trial size to see how light would work with my skin tone.</li>
      <li>It has the ability to create the perfect amount of coverage without giving your face that heavy makeup</li>
      <li>This set is even for FREE on Sephora site and in stores!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product is smooth</li>
      <li>The light color is a shade too light for my summer complexion  </li>
      <li>My face feels smooth and oil free.</li>
      <li>It has light to medium coverage.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions are my own after personal use.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite  powder, it&#x27;s smooth and light and works great on my naturally oily skin.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh!</li>
      <li>The brush is nice and soft!</li>
      <li>The brush looks tiny but it&#x27;s actually the perfect size to create the perfect amount of coverage without being too heavy and wasting the product.</li>
      <li>I got the light shade because I&#x27;m pretty light</li>
      <li>Any time a product comes with a brush is a huge plus for me so that I can get a fresh feel with a dedicated tool.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used the full sized product years ago, but I wanted to see if I might like to try it again.</li>
      <li>I kind of just expected more.</li>
      <li>bare minerals are great coverage and the fact that it is natural is a plus</li>
      <li>Perhaps they think that the brush is worth the excess amount?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never owned a brush with bristles that feel so soft, smooth, and overall good against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Only thing is that the shade was a bit too light for my skin, so make sure to find the right shade before purchasing.</li>
      <li>I recieved these items right away from seller.</li>
      <li>I love bare minerals!</li>
      <li>Even though I love bare essentials, and have a ton of their products, I would never buy this again.</li>
      <li>I love bare escentuals and this was no exception.</li>
      <li>And super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Just such a great brand, and aside from wishing this was bigger I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
      <li>Love the product but so tiny!</li>
      <li>so I like to use a BB cream first then a powder foundation to set and conceal.</li>
      <li>Picture shows exactly what your recieving.</li>
      <li>Even if I would have paid full price my opinion would still be the same, this product is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; size was not even big enough to get a good feel for how it works.</li>
      <li>and I only give 5 starts to products that I feel are worth their full price.</li>
      <li>I bought this product through Amazon Reviewer and it worked really well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can go to Ulta or Sephora and get a trial size, they will give you samples, and you won&#x27;t have to pay this much money for it.</li>
      <li>and it went very well with my skin tone.</li>
      <li>It could certainly sway me to purchase a full size in the future...</li>
      <li>Cute for keeping in your purse and refilling every other day.</li>
      <li>and the brush does work specially if you actually want it to work.</li>
      <li>Obviously it is stated as a trial set so it isn&#x27;t full size by any means.</li>
      <li>but since I already own some of this in the same brand I just might see if I can refill this when it&#x27;s empty and re-use it for my go-bag.</li>
      <li>Only good if you want to try the product a few times.</li>
      <li>After a couple of days of using I finally got the hold to it of how much to apply to get the right coverage.</li>
      <li>If you want this product, even for a trial, purchase one that costs a little more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cute for keeping in your purse and refilling every other day. The jar is the size of a nickel.</li>
    <li> So I was actually selected to review this item. After a couple of days of using I finally got the hold to it of how much to apply to get the right coverage. Looks pretty well, blends great and doesn&#x27;t leave a cakey look at all. Only thing is that the shade was a bit too light for my skin, so make sure to find the right shade before purchasing. I would definetely recommend it. The fact that comes with a brush is also a plus, takes of the hassle of finding the appropriate brush for application.</li>
    <li> I received this \\&quot;trial size\\&quot; item today. Don&#x27;t Buy!!! If you want this product, even for a trial, purchase one that costs a little more. I got a tiny little container that had perhaps one use in it. For $6.99, the amount is ridiculous. Perhaps they think that the brush is worth the excess amount? If so, I disagree. It is a standard make-up brush, nothing special about it, and it also is tiny in size; therefore impractical. I buy many, many items from Amazon, but I think this is the first time I have ever felt ripped off by a seller in the three + years of shopping here.  As to the quality of the product, it seems a lot like face powder, which I can buy for $4 or $5 at the pharmacy or grocery store.</li>
    <li> I am incredibly disappointed that this is the same set that big name beauty chains are giving away for FREE! There is NO WAY this is worth $12.99 because this is literally a quarter sized container (see photos) with very little product inside - maybe one application at best.  Buyer beware - spend your money towards the actual full-sized product or one of those kits that Ulta or Sephora sells at a discount.  You&#x27;ll get way more for your money!</li>
    <li> I have used the full sized product years ago, but I wanted to see if I might like to try it again. This set is perfect because you get a good amount of product in the quarter-size jar and a nice buffing brush to apply it.  The product itself is still great like it was years ago! No heavy, powdery feeling and a natural effect. I have a lot of redness so I like to use a BB cream first then a powder foundation to set and conceal. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product through amazon review trader, and its amazing. full coverage and matched my skintone perfectly. I do wish the sample brush was a little bigger though.</li>
    <li> Okay I&#x27;ve never tried this product before but I love it! It covers up what you need while making your skin even and it is very light and does not look like you are wearing anything. I am sold and will now purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product!!! It&#x27;s light weight breathable powder feels amazing on my skin. It gives me the coverage I&#x27;m looking for yet, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals! It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh! I have used other mineral make ups in the past and none of those compare! In exchange for my review, I was given a huge discount on this product. Even if I would have paid full price my opinion would still be the same, this product is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I received  this product  in exchange  for a review. This is my new favorite  powder, it&#x27;s smooth and light and works great on my naturally oily skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product through Amazon Reviewer and it worked really well. I have combination skin and it made the areas that I am oily look really great.</li>
    <li> I already have this but i love the fact that it has a mini brush... i take this with me everywhere so when i need a touch up it is mobile... bare minerals are great coverage and the fact that it is natural is a plus</li>
    <li> This is a very small sample. Only good if you want to try the product a few times.</li>
    <li> I bought the trial size to see how light would work with my skin tone. There are no pictures because it was much too dark and orange once applied to my skin. Despite the color being quite dark my skin looked smoother where I had applied the product. The brush that comes with it is trial size as well, so keep that in mind. You&#x27;ll really want a larger brush for applying this to your face.  Disclaimer: I received this item complimentary or at a reduced price for my HONEST review and I only give 5 starts to products that I feel are worth their full price. I try to go into detail if I have given an item 3 or less stars.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! My face feels smooth and oil free. This powder is super light weight with excellent coverage! I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> The product is great quality. The amount of the trial is a little bigger than a quarter, smaller than I imagined, but still a great product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:d2be9b85cbb781e0bf22afa8eaf50f09]]I love Bare Escentuals, but! I could not recommend buying this for this price because I think and feel that it is kind of a rip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can go to Ulta or Sephora and get a trial size, they will give you samples, and you won&#x27;t have to pay this much money for it. The price for this tiny tiny tiny super tiny little kit is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to get this because I was hoping that I would be able to try out the light color on my neck. For contouring, but I was so disappointed when I opened it that I can&#x27;t even begin to express my serious sadness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am being a wee bit of a makeup snob, but I dunno I kind of just expected more. Even though I love bare essentials, and have a ton of their products, I would never buy this again. The handle on the brush is so small that I can&#x27;t even really do anything. This set is even for FREE on Sephora site and in stores!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how somebody could use this as a trial set when I don&#x27;t feel like I could even really be happy with it because looking at it kind of annoys me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review, I still paid for it. And I&#x27;m not happy with the price that I paid for this tiny little thing.</li>
    <li> SMALL!!!! But would work to pack in an overnight bag or keep in your purse for a touch-up.</li>
    <li> The brush was very soft but i love it and the trail set was ok  kinda small but was cute. I recieved these items right away from seller. Picture shows exactly what your recieving.</li>
    <li> Very small sample size. Great product though. And super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> So tiny!  Love the product but so tiny! Not worth the $3. :-(</li>
    <li> This Bare Escentuals Trial Set is a nice little set to try out to see if you even like it. I found out real quick that I do like it. I got the light shade because I&#x27;m pretty light and it went very well with my skin tone. The little brush that comes with this is a bit small but it&#x27;s called a trial set and the brush does work specially if you actually want it to work. The powder is very nice on my face and not cakey and it looks really nice! I actually like this trial set size wise as I can put it in my purse for when I need touch ups on the go! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> I love bare escentuals and this was no exception. Goes on really nice and makes your skin look amazing. It is tiny though, I didn&#x27;t realize the size. It is perfect for travel and your purse.</li>
    <li> Cutest bare minerals I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s doll size.. You don&#x27;t hardly get anything but it&#x27;s an awesome size to keep in purse for touch ups; also, it came with a teeny tiny buki brush which I love:)</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The brush looks tiny but it&#x27;s actually the perfect size to create the perfect amount of coverage without being too heavy and wasting the product. I have medium skin tone, and this shade was perfect on me. It has light to medium coverage. It helps to cover up any imperfections but won&#x27;t do the job on its own, so I suggest using another powder after the foundation is applied.&lt;br /&gt;Bare Minerals definitely has a leg up on it&#x27;s competitors, such as Ocean Mist. This foundation has about 3X as much coverage as any other brand that I have found so far. It has the ability to create the perfect amount of coverage without giving your face that heavy makeup feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I DEFINITELY recommend, you won&#x27;t be sorry. Even if you aren&#x27;t crazy about the foundation, I guarantee you will love the brush. I&#x27;ve never owned a brush with bristles that feel so soft, smooth, and overall good against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to receive this in their promotional offer in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> This trial sized set is so perfect for a purse. It is extremely small about the size of a quarter and only has a few uses. I stayed on all day was the perfect color and gentle on my skin. The brush can be used for blush when finished with the powder, it&#x27;s too nice to throw away. It cam in very simple packaging and it completely sealed so you know it wasn&#x27;t tampered with.</li>
    <li> This is the first time using bare essentials and I am very happy with the product. This little trial is small but packs a good punch, you don&#x27;t need very much to give you coverage. The light color is a shade too light for my summer complexion  so I will order something darker and keep this for the winter, but I love it!</li>
    <li> From reading prior reviews, I was expecting it to be small, but not THIS TINY! I have used Bare Minerals before, but it&#x27;s been years since I used their face powder. This &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; size was not even big enough to get a good feel for how it works.</li>
    <li> This product is smooth an lightweight, the color for me didn&#x27;t match and coverage was blotchy even with primer! The brush is nice and soft! I used this more for a bronzer and it worked well and looked good! I do suggest this for a darker complexion skin!</li>
    <li> Felt really light on my skin! Great coverage.. would definitely  try more products!!</li>
    <li> Just such a great brand, and aside from wishing this was bigger I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Obviously it is stated as a trial set so it isn&#x27;t full size by any means. It is great for travel and tossing into a makeup bag for your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth consistency - goes on easily and blends well. I love that it isn&#x27;t heavy it gives a great all over tone and matte finish while being lightweight and easy on the skin. Any time a product comes with a brush is a huge plus for me so that I can get a fresh feel with a dedicated tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did order light, which is says on the tag but the packaging all says original which I feel is a better description. I have light to tan skin, olive toned when I get sun; yet I feel that all the other colors that the trial version was available in were entirely too dark for my undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on great over concealer to set the spots and blends naturally in a neutral manner. It could certainly sway me to purchase a full size in the future...but since I already own some of this in the same brand I just might see if I can refill this when it&#x27;s empty and re-use it for my go-bag. I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions are my own after personal use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small it would be. But I just wanted to test out this product and I like it! Covers the skin will. Might look into getting the bigger version.</li>
