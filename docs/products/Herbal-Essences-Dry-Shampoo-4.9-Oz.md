### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>hair)&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless the product adds textures and freshen your hair their awesome scent.</li>
      <li>I have never in my life had a beauty product work as perfectly as this.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the product.</li>
      <li>but of all of them, this one was best.</li>
      <li>my hair looks great!  </li>
      <li>but it did make my hair smell wonderful!  </li>
      <li>Still a great option though!</li>
      <li>This worked great with my hair!</li>
      <li>I was very impressed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells good!</li>
      <li>My hair also stayed in place making this a great alternative to hair spray since I NEVER use hair spray.</li>
      <li>I have not yet experienced that</li>
      <li>and I think it smells great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great price for something that works</li>
      <li>and it DOES work just as great as others.</li>
      <li>have to say it feels great when that spray comes bursting out of the can onto my scalp.</li>
      <li>I have now used it four or five times and it works great.</li>
      <li>Great price, too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells great, not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is great for touch ups between washing your hair.</li>
      <li>This smells really great and works well.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is the best for those with oily hair and watch out for the strong smell!</li>
      <li>This will handily assist me in extending my blow-outs!</li>
      <li>The good news is the manufacturer was understanding, and very nice, and sent a coupon for any of their products.</li>
      <li>It is a very good trick to get away with not being able to shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I loved it.</li>
      <li>no matter how good you shake it, still makes hair sticky and unmanageable..</li>
      <li>and i know herbal essences is a good brand</li>
      <li>I loved the product when it did work</li>
      <li>I have to apply it before I get to that point: give my hair a good spraying at the roots all around where I care about preventing oil, and brush it through.    </li>
      <li>I shook the can, as instructed, and when sprayed, the product surprisingly smelled a lot like hair spray – perhaps caused by propellant and maybe alcohol?</li>
      <li>/&gt;This smells really good.</li>
      <li>thought this stuff would be a good bet because I like Herbal Essence&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it looks and feels clean in your hair.  </li>
      <li>Definitely better than Psst!</li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s pretty perfect!</li>
      <li>shake, shake some more, spray and work into the roots, and brush out as desired....and voila!....</li>
      <li>Update: 3 uses before it clogged!</li>
      <li>This product leaked out of the can and ruined the top of my dresser!</li>
      <li>It is nice for those Saturday morning trips to town, though.</li>
      <li>I love the way this smells, and it does a great job of giving my hair the just washed look, but they need to find a better spraying mechanism.  </li>
      <li>This is one of those lightweight aluminum spray cans that are popular now.  </li>
      <li>Believe it or not, it looks better than great and looks better than it did yesterday.  </li>
      <li>I liked the product...</li>
      <li>The scent is nice without being a gender defining floral or &#x27;sport&#x27; fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It just freshens up your hair and makes it smell nice.  </li>
      <li>The smell is kind of nauseating.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m actually able to finish the bottle, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good value as well.</li>
      <li>understand you have tried running it under warm water</li>
      <li>I think its some kind of peppermint grapefruit thing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews trying to find a good one</li>
      <li>On top of doing an excellent job of absorbing the oil, it gives me volume.</li>
      <li>This has a light pleasant scent that is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>* Rinse the inside button (top) under the stream of warm water.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ran it under warm water and that helped; I was able to get another 2-3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although the scent is by far the BEST herbal essences scent Ever!!</li>
      <li>but the scent was really strong!</li>
      <li>So I need a product that does a good job at making hair look clean, by taking away the oiliness.  </li>
      <li>When I use it for the first time it works great.</li>
      <li>Even with a very light application, I feel as if I have hair spray in my hair.</li>
      <li>Its a very light feeling spray</li>
      <li>The smell was even nice great, and it sprayed on super easy and was easy to use in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an aerosol, destroys oil, and has a pleasant lingering fresh</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>However,  I think my hair looks better with the product even though I&#x27;m still using a headband fort bangs.</li>
      <li>I want more product</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is one arena I do think salon brands fare better.  </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m a notorious product overuser, especially first time uses).</li>
      <li>I love love</li>
      <li>granted it does look a bit better than before I did it.</li>
      <li>If you like mint than im sure you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
      <li>If you need 12 hours of looking perfect, try to use a regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>The more I use, the more crispy a texture I end up with.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent from Herbal Essences so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>like most reviewers here, I&#x27;ve had problems with the nozzle clogging.</li>
      <li>I was able to use it twice before it clogged up.  </li>
      <li>My hair ended up looking MUCH more greasy, AND it felt grimy all day.</li>
      <li>and I look like I have more hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had to brush for like, 15 minutes to get it mostly out.</li>
      <li>Threw most of the bottle in the trash.</li>
      <li>the two times I was able to use it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product,</li>
      <li>and this one was my favorite.</li>
      <li>Smells great and really works well as a root lifter.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase this product from Amazon, but since I see so many complaints about the clogged bottle rather than the product itself</li>
      <li>but like so many reviewers here</li>
      <li>I actually loved the dry shampoo...worked great...</li>
      <li>I loved this product the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Clairol really needs to resolve the quality of the bottle if they want to have a successful product.</li>
      <li>, I think Herbal Essences has the best dry shampoo formula.</li>
      <li>greatest dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>One of the best dry shampoo I ever used, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking</li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrance, isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>So, when I tried this, I was hoping for the perfect dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is very easy to apply, shake it up a good bit then spray directly to your roots.</li>
      <li>My daughter says it works great, though the nozzle got clogged on her, but she managed to clear it.</li>
      <li>There are absolutely no words to describe how amazing this stuff is!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Having the same problem as other reviewers. The aerosol works fine for the first one or two applications and then breaks.  After this happened once I thought it was a fluke, but the second bottle I tried a few weeks later did the same thing. Clairol really needs to resolve the quality of the bottle if they want to have a successful product. I&#x27;ve switched over to Dove dry shampoo which, regardless of HEs application issues, is a much more effective product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two bottles and had the same problem with both. The nozzle clogs after the first few uses.  I tried running it under hot water to loosen it and you only get one quick spray before it clogs again.  I love the way this smells, and it does a great job of giving my hair the just washed look, but they need to find a better spraying mechanism.  If they incorporated a new spray nozzle I would love to try this again.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge dry shampoo fan, but will use it in a pinch when traveling, camping, etc. First of, I love the look of the bottle and I love the light, minty, citrusy smell. This is my favorite scent from Herbal Essences so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially after using this, my hair felt heavy and oily, even after working it through my hair and brushing it out. I thought I would hate it. However, after about an hour or so, my hair feels clean, shiny, and light again. I can still smell the scent for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely volumizing, almost like a hair spray. I am 30 years old and noticing that my hair is getting slightly thinner and flatter. Using this really helped to boost the volume of my hair, which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving this 4-stars because the initial application always makes me feel oily for awhile.</li>
    <li> This is actually one of my favorite dry shampoos, but the bottle nozzle breaks almost immediately and makes it unusable.  Such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I am slightly shocked by how many reviewed said their bottle broke, as i came here looking to replace one i bought at walgreens that broke almost immediately..... Now i know that i should look elsewhere for a dry shampoo, even though i actually liked the product inside the cheap bottle.</li>
    <li> total crap.. is like spraying hair spray in your hair.. no matter how good you shake it, still makes hair sticky and unmanageable.. My hair feels more gross with this in, than it did before.</li>
    <li> Only dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave white powder, doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell weird, and doesn&#x27;t cause dandruff/itching/bad hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and have used it 2 or 3 times. When I first spray it in my hair it feels light and fluffy and clean, but then within a few minutes it just makes my hair feel sticky and dirty and heavy. This is my first time trying dry shampoo so I hope they&#x27;re not all lime this.</li>
    <li> This smells really great and works well.  I like to use it as a quickie hair pickup after a long day.</li>
    <li> i have used many different dry shampoos in the part. When i ran out of my beloved batiste dry shampoo i decided to give something else a try. I saw this and i know herbal essences is a good brand and it the packaging looked so promising. I should have known! First off, the smell! No, just no. If you like mint than im sure you&#x27;ll love this. Second, i dont think it did much for my greasiness. I admit i go like 3-4 days without showering so maybe this is good for the first 1-2 days, but i had to keep applying this every few hours because it kept getting greasy again. Also the texture it left my hair was just awful. It left it feeling like i had product in it, not soft and tangle free. I do not like that buildup feeling and my hair feeling like it cant just flow around. Terrible, the whole experience was just terrible. Ive only used it for a week and decided i cant do it and bought a different dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one plus about this dry shampoo though is that my nozzle didnt stop working like everyone else complained about. I guess thankgoodness for that.</li>
    <li> Leaves no residue like most dry shampoos. Smells great and really works well as a root lifter.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product twice. first time - used 1 time and bottle broke; second order lasted for 4 uses! this is rediculas!</li>
    <li> There are always days when we get caught with dirty hair. This helps keep you from having oily yucky hair..</li>
    <li> While the shampoo worked great, I could only use id thrice, after that the spray nozzle is stuck and does not spray anymore! is it so hard to design the bottle for such a bug company! they are literally duping us for our money!</li>
    <li> I bought mine from a local publix, but I felt like I just had to make a comment because this just so smells so freaking good &gt;.&lt; I even started using it as a deodorant because of the smell.</li>
    <li> Typically I have to wash my hair every day because it gets oily but washing and styling every day is a royal hassle and dries it out so I figured I&#x27;d give this a go. Hey if it buys me 20 minutes in the morning, soaks up oil and thickens my hair, I&#x27;m sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon my first application I would&#x27;ve given this a strong 4 ½ star rating. It&#x27;s a good thing I waited before hitting the keyboard and typing out some useless fangirly review. After giving the bottle a good shake, shake, shake as instructed, I sprayed it on my roots and brushed it through. It smelled fresh, kind of herby (I like herby) and my hair actually looked as if I&#x27;d just washed it (when I hadn&#x27;t) and it didn&#x27;t leave any weird residue or discoloration on my hair or scalp (but please note I have naturally dark blonde hair and am pale as a corpse so this might show up on darker skin tones and hair). It even added a little bit of body to my limp roots. Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Attempt Two happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempt Two did not go well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempt Three was even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem? The spray clogs! I hadn&#x27;t realized it at first and after taking my hair out of headband curls, I attempted to spray my roots, fluff it up and go about my day just as I did during Attempt One. This was a very bad idea. The spray came out in a stream of wet goo. Being the dummy that I am, I figured I just didn&#x27;t do the shake, shake, shaking thing correctly and attempted again on the other side of my head. Now I had unpleasant wet goo on both sides. My air dried, effortless curls were now non-existent and I had a half dry/half damp limp mess on my hands. After digging out the hairdryer and a hair tie I left for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried again this morning. This is Attempt Three. I paid for this stuff and was determined to get my money&#x27;s worth. I also still figured it was MY mistake. But this time I wised up and attempted the spray into the shower first, rather than my head.  This time it wouldn&#x27;t spray at all. After much vigorous shaking it was still a no go. I didn&#x27;t think this was  my mistake anymore. I ended up running the clogged sprayer under hot water (three times, mind you, I&#x27;m nothing if not persistent) and eventually I was able to make it work enough to get a pathetic little, drippy spray going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this unless you plan on using it all up in one fell swoop. It&#x27;s a decent product if you can get it to work. I feel like a guinea pig for the company because it obviously hadn&#x27;t been tested by real users before being released to the public.at all.

    <li> YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO USE IT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND IT WILL STOP WORKING. I RECOMMEND TRAVEL SIZE THOUGH IF YOU PLAN ON USING IT ONLY A COUPLE OF TIMES</li>
    <li> Granted: I have only used the sample size and someone else wrote a review that the larger size only works a couple of times. But I am taking the risk to buy the larger size because I thought this product not only smells nice (very fresh) but also, it is so much better in terms of how my hair feels than the only other dry shampoo I have tried (Tresseme...I think that&#x27;s how you spell it but in any case it smells bad!). I am open to other recommendations if there is an alternative to Tresseme and this product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I loved this product the first time I used it. Unfortunately, I had the same results as other reviewers. The second attempt to use it, the nozzle was clogged. No amount of rinsing could make it work. I called the customer care line and was sent a coupon for up to $10 on a single item. I will probably just use it on a jumbo bottle of shampoo. But I&#x27;m disappointed because I really liked this on the first try.</li>
    <li> I think I just dislike dry shampoo in general, but this one was extra baby-powdery.</li>
    <li> Now I didn&#x27;t have the problem of the nozzle getting  clogged.  I used it once, didn&#x27;t like it.  Left it on my dresser for  about a month.  Went back to it, gave it another chance, but the  air compressor died.  It spat out some gunk, but  it had to force behind it.  The bottle is not damaged, the weather has been cold/cool, just so disappointed  by this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this product from Amazon, but since I see so many complaints about the clogged bottle rather than the product itself I thought I&#x27;d post a solution.  I too had a problem with my first bottle and assumed it was an isolated defect, but after reading the reviews on this site I see that it&#x27;s practically inevitable. Before throwing out the half full bottle I decided to try what I usually use to unclog hairspray nozzles.  I just flipped the cap backwards to bend the little plastic tab that keeps it attached to the bottle and then filled spray channel of the cap with rubbing alcohol and for good measure ran a small plastic flosser inside the hole (not sure if that step&#x27;s entirely necessary), let it set about 45 seconds and then poured and shook out the alcohol, and blew air through the nozzle. It works fine now. Problem solved, at least until the next time the powder builds up.  I think you could probably use one of those compressed air canisters for dusting computer parts with as much success, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself I think it works well. It adds good texture and volume, makes dirty hair look presentable in a pinch, and the mint feels nice on your scalp without any burning and adds a nice fresh scent. Overall I recommend it, but haven&#x27;t tried many others so I can&#x27;t give a comparison. Now that I&#x27;m actually able to finish the bottle, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good value as well.</li>
    <li> I have used various dry shampoos throughout the last 2 years. This beats out some of the higher-end brands from Sephora, as well as all of the drug store brands I have tried. It has to be shaken a bit more than the normal dry shampoo, otherwise I noticed that it comes out slightly wet. Like any dry shampoo, you should spray liberally at the roots, leave for a few minutes, rub in, and then brush out if needed. I like this brand better because it is effective, and the minty smell is much more bearable than other brands.</li>
    <li> Oh my god. There are absolutely no words to describe how amazing this stuff is!!! I have never in my life had a beauty product work as perfectly as this. A little tip about the bad reviews over the nozzle: use a q-tip dipped in a little bit of rubbing alcohol (or rose water ;) ) to clean the tiny nozzle before putting the top back on and storing the can away. This has kept to nozzle from clogging up for me!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it works like a miracle! I buy this in bulk for my extra long thick locks!</li>
    <li> This product left my hair dry, rough, and breaking off every time I touched my hair. Menthol, mint, and citrus are all skin irritants (I should&#x27;ve read the package). The second ingredient is alcohol. This dry shampoo was the most expensive drug store brand at my store (out of Batiste) with the worst results. The nozzle clogged after one use, it is very uneven in consistency, and it smells like a pack of gum. Threw most of the bottle in the trash.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work, and it does smell lovely, but it did nothing for my hair.  It did not absorb oil or fluff up my hair.  If anything, it weighed it down even more.  I have very fine, blonde hair, but perhaps it works for other hair types.</li>
    <li> I typically wash my hair every day, occasionally I&#x27;ll shower later in the day or skip a day and that&#x27;s when I use this dry shampoo.  I think it works well after only one day of not washing, I just spray a light coat after brushing and it helps hair not have that piecey look that hair gets when it isn&#x27;t freshly washed.  I would apply a light coat at a time because it can have a powdery look if you apply it too thickly.  I have not had any issues with the can/nozzle clumping or getting clogged.  I like the smell too, minty and fresh smelling, which fits with the concept of the product.</li>
    <li> This actually made my hair clumpy and didn&#x27;t make them feel or look any cleaner. I tried it a few times from different distances and amounts and it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Yep my bottle broke too. Only used it twice.  So disappointed. I noticed a few on the store shelves were half empty... Should have seen that as a sign.</li>
    <li> i have used a variety of dry shampoos and this is by far the best one. It smells great and leaves your hair less itchy than most. It smells fresh and very clean!</li>
    <li> This product leaked out of the can and ruined the top of my dresser! It has to be sanded and restained which is a LOT of work! Defective can, damaging to wood.</li>
    <li> **Review Edit** After following these instructions, the clog only got worse. I ended up wasting my money anyways and threw it away. The product isn&#x27;t good enough to be worth the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey all!!&lt;br /&gt;Just like most reviewers here, I&#x27;ve had problems with the nozzle clogging. I like the product, just not the container. Well, I emailed Herbal Essences and asked how to solve the issue and they sent me this email:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It may help to know that sometimes dry shampoo spray nozzles get clogged, but they can usually be fixed quite easily. Unlike a hairspray, this contains oil absorbers that can clog the sprayer. Be sure to give the product a hard, vigorous shake before each use to help unclog the oil absorbers from the spray nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand you have tried running it under warm water but it&#x27;s also important to know that the cap flips up. I have included our general recommendation for dispensing issues with dry shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Take the dry shampoo product to the sink &amp; turn the warm water on a gentle stream.&lt;br /&gt;* From the front near the spray nozzle, gently flip the button open: the button is on a hinge -- open it just like a flip-top cap.&lt;br /&gt;* Rinse the inside button (top) under the stream of warm water.&lt;br /&gt;* Let the button air dry until all the water is evaporated. You can use a paper towel to speed up the drying.&lt;br /&gt;* After it&#x27;s dry, push the button (top) down to close.&lt;br /&gt;* Vigorously shake the dry shampoo product, and try to spray again.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will solve all of your frustrations.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as great as I expected but i&#x27;ve definitely used worse dry shampoos before. In my opinion I like dry shampoos to be more powdery then liquidy when you spray it on your hair and this one only has a little white powder when you use it. Like I said though ive used worse and it DOES work just as great as others.</li>
    <li> I actually loved the dry shampoo...worked great...but as other reviewers said, the bottle stopped spraying when it was less than half gone.</li>
    <li> This works relatively well.  It does refresh hair but it doesn&#x27;t help add any body whatsoever.  It is a very good trick to get away with not being able to shampoo.  It does not leave hair powdery like some dry shampoos do.  Just spray where needed and brush through hair. Light scent won&#x27;t overpower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences Naked Dry Shampoo 3 times now. So far, it hasn&#x27;t clogged up.&lt;br /&gt;It sprays out cold &amp; ever so slightly wet.&lt;br /&gt; Work it into your roots and/or any area that is getting oily.&lt;br /&gt;Then brush through your hair to distribute the dry shampoo.  (I use a natural bristle brush)&lt;br /&gt;It  gives my very soft,  baby fine hair some body, and doesn&#x27;t change the color, dull or weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s been cleaned, but my hair looks decent &amp; not embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review if my experience with this product changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this several times now &amp; it has never clogged. I shake it well and spray it in an upright position.</li>
    <li> I was only able to use this once.  The  next time I tried to apply the nozzle didn&#x27;t work.  Poor quality product.</li>
    <li> The quality of the product is on par with other dry shampoos, in my opinion.  These are love &#x27;em or hate &#x27;em deals.  I was horrified the first time my hairdresser suggested I stop washing my hair daily.  It&#x27;s made a dramatic improvement, and products like this are handy on the off-days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem, as other reviewers have noted, is this particular mechanism clogs.  I find this almost always happens regardless of product - you&#x27;re spraying powder, after all.  One thing I found useful with the Herbal Essences one here, is that immediately after use I soak the cap.  This delayed the clogging, but it&#x27;s also a pain in the rear, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one arena I do think salon brands fare better.  If you&#x27;re looking for a non-salon version, Dove actually makes a fab one that works well in terms of revitalizing your hair, and it has functional packaging.</li>
    <li> It has a pleasant scent, like peaches, a little fruity.  Its a very light feeling spray and I applied it liberally into my hair and worked it through with my fingers.  It does make my long and a bit coarse (like horse hair) dark hair feel lighter and gives a refreshing feeling.  I&#x27;d put it the equivalent of a body spray only just for hair.  It does NOT take the place of an actual wash.  It just freshens up your hair and makes it smell nice.  I&#x27;ve read in other reviews about clogging.  I have not yet experienced that but if the user is paying for their product that huge detractor.  But based strictly on my on use I give it a middling rating.  Again not a replacement for a real hair wash, but it is a pleasant refreshing experience if you have to just go a little longer than usual before washes.  Added Note: Yes, after a couple uses my bottle clogged up as well.</li>
    <li> I am glad I had a chance to try this for free thanks to Amazon Vine.  I would&#x27;ve been thoroughly disgusted had I purchased it.  Anyway, guess what.  The nozzle gave out on me just like it has for so many other reviewers.  What I got after the broken nozzle was so gunky, I like others just threw the stuff out.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give a complete and thorough review of the product, but considering that the can clogged after literally the first use I can&#x27;t really attest to whether or not I would continue to use it.  I KNEW I should have bought the sample size, but I thought &amp;#34;I really like Redken&#x27;s powder fresh dry shampoo, but it&#x27;s so expensive so I am going to get the large size instead&amp;#34; WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product wasn&#x27;t horrible but it did deposit way too much powder and it made my hairline white.  I had to brush it out really well so my hair wouldn&#x27;t look gray.  I figured I would try it again in a few days and spray further away only the can didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a dry shampoo, and was excited to try this product.  This one uses tapioca in the spray to absorb excess oil and kind of bring some life back to the hair.  The smell was even nice great, and it sprayed on super easy and was easy to use in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the can fizzled out after only three uses.  This is one of those lightweight aluminum spray cans that are popular now.  And by the 4th time I went to use the dry shampoo, the product came out in spurts and streams instead of the nice spray I was used to.  It appears the can did not have enough propellant to spray the product anymore.  I did nothing to the can, let it in the cabinet when not in use, so overall I liked the product but was sad about the can seemed like such a waste.  Hope you don’t have that problem.  However if you have a question feel free to leave a comment below and I will try to answer it.</li>
    <li> This has a light pleasant scent that is not overpowering. It does a good job of absorbing the oils in your hair and making it look fresh again. I did find that Suave dry shampoo seems to work a little better though.</li>
    <li> Yesterday I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars. I had never used a dry shampoo but was curious to try one. I blow dry my curly hair straight, weekly and usually leave it that way for at least 5 days. Day 6/7 depend on the weather and how dirty my hair looks. My hair starts to get oily near my scalp. This spray absorbed the oil, leaving my hair refreshed. It smells wonderful, mists on softly and does not get hair wet. It absorbs almost immediately and does not flake.I was very impressed. My hair also stayed in place making this a great alternative to hair spray since I NEVER use hair spray. I loved it. The following day I grabbed the bottle and it was wet. It was also half full. now, when I depress the sprayer it sprays and leaks. I know that these things are fragile but it was sitting on my dresser for a day. I can&#x27;t figure out why it now leaks. I had to knock a star off for that reason but the product works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m someone who has to wash my hair every day because it tends to get pretty oily. I hate having to spend the time every day to wash and dry my hair so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. First time I tried it my hair looked pretty good but the scent was really strong! Then I tried it again and my hair still looks oily...granted it does look a bit better than before I did it. I don&#x27;t think this product is the best for those with oily hair and watch out for the strong smell!</li>
    <li> One of the best dry shampoo I ever used, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking gray,(FYI...I have jet black hair)&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless the product adds textures and freshen your hair their awesome scent. I love the smell of this product,</li>
    <li> Due to the fact that my bottle was shipped without a cap as seen in the picture, it came completely empty.  I could smell the perfume all over the packaging and when I took it out, could barely hear anything inside the bottle when shaken.  When I tried to get out what small amount was left, it gave a very pathetic hiss and that was it.  I couldn&#x27;t even try it.  Too bad because I&#x27;m always looking for a dry shampoo that actually works.</li>
    <li> A \\&quot;dry shampoo\\&quot; is an interesting concept.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t take the place of a wet shampoo in the shower, but it&#x27;s a great way to refresh your hair after a long day at work if you&#x27;re going out afterwards and don&#x27;t have time to go home in between.  Spraying it on, It feels like one of those computer keyboard air cleaners with a pressure of cold, dry air coming out.  I tried this dry shampoo after a quick workout at the gym after work.  I spramped it (obscure [[ASIN:B00009Y3RW Will &amp; Grace]] reference) on my hair, \\&quot;fluffed\\&quot; it up with my hands, and it gave me some added volume that lasted the rest of the evening.  It also appeared to lighten my hair a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I use it all the time?  No.  But when you&#x27;re on the go, it&#x27;s a nice alternative to adding additional product to your hair that would just weigh it down.  It&#x27;s a handy tool for those days when you just don&#x27;t have time for a total refresh between activities.</li>
    <li> UPDATE (09/01/2014): I took this back out this weekend to use ... it would not spray AT ALL!! It had only been used one time before (just a few days prior). The weight of the can indicates that there is plenty of product. Likewise, I can feel the product moving around in the can. After shaking (a lot), a few drop literally spilled out onto my hair. I pressed hard, I pressed lightly, I did everything I could. NOTHING WILL COME OUT. It seems that I am not alone either. At this time, I highly caution consumers to wait until they read that this problem has been resolved by the company.    ORIGINAL POST: After sitting for nearly two hours in a salon chair, I can tell you that I&#x27;m not too eager to wash-out the color and blow-out the next day. Therefore, I&#x27;ve become a dry-shampoo connoisseur. [[ASIN:B001QWCCWK Frederic Fekkai Au Naturel Dry Shampoo]] is difficult to use (since it is not a spray) and a little messy, [[ASIN:B00CZE9YHO Garnier Fructis Volume Extend Instant Bodifier Dry Shampoo for Fine or Flat Hair]] is pretty fantastic but if you use it in excess, your hair will be white (it washes out, no worries), AND [[ASIN:B00CY14XL0 Victoria&#x27;s Secret fresh body dry shampoo Supermodel Approved]] is horribly sticky (like hairspray). So, when I tried this, I was hoping for the perfect dry shampoo. I may have found it!    Here, the smell is clean (minty/citrusy but very light). Moreover, it leaves hair feeling natural and soft (I could easily run my fingers through it). And, I have yet to see any white streaks (but often this is the result of my using too much). And, yes, it absorbs light oil like a dream.    This will handily assist me in extending my blow-outs! For me, it&#x27;s pretty perfect!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much a hit or miss when it comes to dry shampoo products.&lt;br /&gt;This Herbal Essence version is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Tapioca starch absorbs oil while peppermint freshens and deodorizes. The scent is nice without being a gender defining floral or &#x27;sport&#x27; fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I section one area at a time, spraying the roots without saturating. Just a short, light burst. Then using my fingertips I work it in, wait a few moments, then brush using a boar bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;My limp locks became full of body and volume.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my hair was back to flat in 5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;For a hectic day or a surprise evening out, this dry shampoo is great. If you need 12 hours of looking perfect, try to use a regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Not crazy about a hard to recycle container, either.</li>
    <li> I chose this product to try because occasionally to be on time to work I need to either pull my hair back in a pony tail or a headband. I wanted to see if I could use this dry shampoo as an alternative. I have long hair.  I have never tried a dry shampoo before.  This product comes out in cold liquid form and then you work through hair.  I find for my hair to not look frizzy at ends when using this product, I need to put on from roots to tips.  I have fine hair and this product makes it look straight, smooth and silky.  I still had to use a headband which is why I have 4 stars because I had some loose bang pieces that would not stay down.  However,  I think my hair looks better with the product even though I&#x27;m still using a headband fort bangs.</li>
    <li> My hair: shoulder-length, thick, coarse, wavy.&lt;br /&gt;The spray comes out quickly and very cold and wet but quickly dries.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good! (and it&#x27;s not the knock-you-over scent typical of the brand)&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to the greasiest areas and it seemed to work well as long as my hair wasn&#x27;t TOO greasy. 2-4 days was fine, but particularly greasy 4-5 day hair wasn&#x27;t getting better.&lt;br /&gt;I have very heavy, voluminous hair anyway, so I was actually pleasantly surprised when this spray smoothed and flattened my hair. YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had the clogging problem or residue mentioned by other reviewers after about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Getting it out of my hair required more than my usual gentle shampoo, but YMMV.</li>
    <li> This is great for touch ups between washing your hair. It has a nice fragrance, isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, and absorbs quickly. It also has a little bit of a hold like hair spray, which helps with styling.</li>
    <li> I Wouldnt write a review if this weren&#x27;t so bad......... I Bought this at my local Walgreens, because they do not carry GOT2B rockin it dry shampoo, oh how I regret it, first of all smells horrible and it makes it hard to breathe.... And I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; or anything when It Comes to beauty products.....&lt;br /&gt;After the INCREDIBLE odor that made it hard to breath found that it left white residue in my hair &amp; did not absorb the oil.....&lt;br /&gt;let me tell you that I used  it a couple of times to give it a chance even with the fan on.... And nope, it was no good so it&#x27;s going to the trash as we speak.&lt;br /&gt;Please save yourself some time and the bad experience and go with something way better.. Like got2b.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying dry shampoo. I have now used it four or five times and it works great. I usually wash my hair every third day, but sometimes depending on the weather, my hair will look pretty greasy on day three and I&#x27;ll have to put it up in a bun or wash early. This worked great with my hair! My hair doesn&#x27;t get oily very quickly and I have long dark brown hair that&#x27;s about average- not thick but not thin. Just FYI. This is very easy to apply, shake it up a good bit then spray directly to your roots. Rub it around and your hair will be looking and smelling fresh. I only gave it four stars because the spray top does seem to clog every two uses, but you can fix this by rinsing the lid after you use it. I also knocked it down a star because I feel like I had to spray a good bit of it on to get the results I wanted. I&#x27;m feeling like if I try a more expensive one, less product may go a little bit further. Still a great option though! Definitely won&#x27;t be my last time using dry shampoo!</li>
    <li> I like this dry shampoo. I cleans well, and adds a ton of volume. The only things I don&#x27;t like is the smell and the white residue. The smell is kind of nauseating. I think its some kind of peppermint grapefruit thing. Also, the white residue would not come out!!!! I had to brush for like, 15 minutes to get it mostly out. I recommend this as a last resort. I do like the price, though. But next time I&#x27;ll make dry shampoo myself.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical.  I am old enough to remember the dry shampoo powders of the 70&#x27;s that my mom used during summer months when our well ran dry.  I am overjoyed to say, this isn&#x27;t your Mom&#x27;s dry shampoo!!  It&#x27;s an aerosol, destroys oil, and has a pleasant lingering fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, curly hair and yesterday I flat ironed it.  This is generally a problem because like most women in the 50+ crowd, my hair is thinning. I hung out in the sun this morning and basically got my hair limp and weighted down.  I followed the instructions on the can...shake, shake some more, spray and work into the roots, and brush out as desired....and voila!....my hair looks great!  Believe it or not, it looks better than great and looks better than it did yesterday.  Apparently there are some additives in this dry shampoo that fluff up the hair a bit, just like a good mousse, only without any sticky residue.  My hair is still straight, only now it has more volume and I look like I have more hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesomeness in a can!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the product. I didn&#x27;t see where it did all that much to my hair after use. Even after brushing, it does leave a tiny amount of fine whitish residue on the hair shafts that seemed to accentuate my gray strands. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo smells great and adds a nice texture.  I try not to wash and blow dry every single day in order to preserve color, so the Herbal Essences Naked Dry Shampoo is a must have.  Great price, too.</li>
    <li> This product is for people with hair like I had in my youth (a Jim Morrison like mane, for real), or like my daughter and grandchildren have today. My daughter says it works great, though the nozzle got clogged on her, but she managed to clear it. I tried it a few times after I&#x27;d done sweaty yard work on hot days and didn&#x27;t want to have to shower twice, and it did make my head and what hair I have feel a lot cleaner (my head and hair get greasy and this dry shampoo helped with that). I also tried it on my 4 year old grandson&#x27;s longish hair one evening when he needed a bath but it got too close to bedtime for that, and it worked well but he didn&#x27;t care for the smell, which he described as \\&quot;too spicy.\\&quot; To him, anything minty is \\&quot;spicy.\\&quot; I find the smell okay and my daughter says she likes it.</li>
    <li> I sprayed a couple of puffs onto my hand to get an idea of the texture and scent of the product. My plan was to use the dry shampoo the next day. I shook the can, as instructed, and when sprayed, the product surprisingly smelled a lot like hair spray – perhaps caused by propellant and maybe alcohol? The dry shampoo was itself rather wet, but dried quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reserved judgment until I could actually test it on my hair, but the test was cut short because the next day when I depressed the top to dispense the product, nothing came out. I took the lid off and tried to clean it out but that did not work – no matter what I did nothing was expelled. So, I do not know if the product works or not because of a total failure of the product’s delivery system.</li>
    <li> Unlike a lot of other dry shampoos, the Herbal Essences Naked Shampoo has a minty smell, sort of like you just brushed your teeth w/ shampoo.  I would rate it similar in quality to Suave or Tresemme, maybe a little less likely to leave you with white streaks.  Definitely better than Psst!, maybe not quite as nice as Batiste, but less expensive.  If you are looking for a dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t smell like fake lemons, this is probably your most economical bet.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with dry shampoo.  I like the product, I like the scent, I like the texture.  I dislike the clogging spray bottle, though.  I was able to use it twice before it clogged up.  I want more product but I&#x27;m afraid to waste my money on it.</li>
    <li> This is nice as a hair freshener, but not as a dry shampoo.  I use &amp;#34;Psssst&amp;#34; dry shampoo and love it since it is really inexpensive and works well with my blonde hair.  This HE dry shampoo didn&#x27;t absorb any oil but it did make my hair smell wonderful!  I would use this to freshen up my hair if I were out at happy hour and came home to freshen up before going out again, but I would not use it for getting the slick off my roots like I can with my trusted brand that is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I keep getting this product as a free sample when I buy the naked shampoo and conditioner. Here&#x27;s the thing: When I use it for the first time it works great. I like the product and I think it smells great. Every other time I try to use it it&#x27;s like all the aerosol in the can has leaked out. No matter how vigorously I shake the can the product comes out in a gross stream of liquid. It&#x27;s literally unusable after one use. I thought this was a fluke with the first mini can I received, but the fullsize version and every other free sample I&#x27;ve gotten have had the exact same defect. If they can figure out a way to fix the packaging I&#x27;d perhaps consider purchasing the product again. Until then....no thanks.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Naked Dry Shampoo is something new, at least for me. Think of it: dry shampoo! You spray it on your hair and, presto, the formula then absorbs oil and cleans your hair. Or so the product description states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say it feels great when that spray comes bursting out of the can onto my scalp. However, I found that my hair still felt oily. I also felt the need to wet my hair afterward and, frankly, use a wet shampoo. Dry shampoo strikes me as an idea that appears not to have been perfected, not if Herbal Essences Naked Dry Shampoo is any indication. I&#x27;m still giving it points for making me feel refreshed, for awhile anyway.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Naked Dry Shampoo works well to absorb excess oiliness between hair washes. I have struggled a bit with balancing exactly how much to use since I have fine hair.  The more I use, the more crispy a texture I end up with.  Even with a very light application, I feel as if I have hair spray in my hair. I have to pull my hair back after I apply it, because it just doesn&#x27;t look or feel the same as when I originally washed and styled it.  It is nice for those Saturday morning trips to town, though. It lets me sleep in a bit on the one day I can and still look presentable for those outings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teen daughter will likely get more use out of it than I will. She likes to use it in the evening after her work or a work-out, to refresh her hair before going out with her friends. The Naked Dry Shampoo has a very pleasant smell, which is helpful when my daughter uses it after working at the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our overall opinion is that it works really well.  Apply it lightly,  massage it in, brush hair, style, and away you go.  :)</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well the first time I used it. But two days later, it did not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came out of the bottle like liquid instead of a powder like other dry shampoos.  No matter how much I sprayed into my hair it still looked greasy and it felt dirty.  I am very disappointed in it and a little annoyed that I paid money for such a useless product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more expensive than other dry shampoos.  I&#x27;ve tried Dove Dry Shampoo and it works much better.  I will never purchase this product again.  It has actually turned me off from buying other Herbal Essences products.</li>
    <li> Although the scent is by far the BEST herbal essences scent Ever!! I love love loveeeeeeeeeeee it!! hopefully, they don&#x27;t discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the nozzle..oh the Nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;Had to go through two bottles just after a few sprays...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what had happened there.. the corporate needs to get on this ASAP! because it&#x27;s such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a five stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the nozzle situation.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried them all, from the inexpensive drugstore brands to the high-end salon labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair, and this leaves no trace of white powder. It completely disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price for something that works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had the clogging issue other reviewers have had, but I&#x27;ll be sure to to one the nozzle in hot water before storing from now on.</li>
    <li> Loved the product but the bottle broke after 3 uses and I was unable to use it any longer. If the bottle didn&#x27;t break i would have given it a much higher rating</li>
    <li> I liked the product... the two times I was able to use it. After that the nozzle clogged and became completely unusable! So sad! I am not one to ever throw things away, but I did in this case. I am always one to fix things that are broken, but this sealed aluminum bottle with tiny one-way nozzle could not be fixed. Poking with a needle and rinsing in hot water were the only possible options and they didn&#x27;t help at all. The good news is the manufacturer was understanding, and very nice, and sent a coupon for any of their products.</li>
    <li> I have never tried a dry shampoo before. I have butt-length hair that I have to wash every other day to keep it from looking greasy and gross. Sometimes, on the days between washings, my bangs and the hair nearest to my scalp starts to look greasy. I thought dry shampoo was the answer. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this stuff would be a good bet because I like Herbal Essence&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners. The first time I tried it, I just sprayed a little bit in my hair. It didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all to cut down on that greasy look. It doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything, either, so not only did my hair not look fresh, it didn&#x27;t even smell particularly fresh. Mint and citrus had sounded so promising, too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried it, I sprayed a lot more on. I thought maybe I just hadn&#x27;t used enough the first time. Like I said, I&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before-- I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works. Turns out that was a terrible idea. My hair ended up looking MUCH more greasy, AND it felt grimy all day. (Note to self: do not experiment with hair products right before work.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I repeated my experiments a few more times with the same results. Either it did nothing at all, or it made my hair look like a nasty grease pit. And never once did I experience any light and fresh minty-citrusy goodness. It does have a scent, yes, but it&#x27;s very faint and, well, I can&#x27;t say it reminds me much of mint OR citrus. Now, I only ever used it on my bangs and on the first 8 inches or so of hair nearest my scalp, working it in and brushing through it afterwards. Maybe if it&#x27;s used in a less concentrated area, it&#x27;ll magically work like it&#x27;s supposed to, I don&#x27;t know. I just know that for me, this stuff was a total fail.</li>
    <li> I like how it smells and feels on my hair... However, the sprayer stopped working the second time I use it, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works wonderfully with little build up, abd smells fantastic and light.  I will deffinatly order this again.  I have oily hair and somtime need extra help.</li>
    <li> I usually wash my hair everyday, if not, every other and my hair goes up in a pony because it starts to feel oily. I tried this once and i noticed it makes my hair hard, sticky and gross. As if i used a bunch of hair spray. Washing it out was the worst part... I&#x27;d rather just wash my hair daily...</li>
    <li> ...as with everybody, the nozzle clogs and stops working! I ran it under warm water and that helped; I was able to get another 2-3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it does work...greatest dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used. I have super dark, almost black, hair and this didn&#x27;t give me white roots (I&#x27;m a notorious product overuser, especially first time uses). The scent is VERY strong and will last all day. Got me and my oily roots through three days without washing my hair...a first.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a camping trip, one day past when I would normally have washed my hair. My hair is very fine, naturally blonde and when it is dirty it LOOKS dirty. I used the product as instructed, spraying at the roots, brushing it through, fluffing up, etc.  I have a lot of hair. After using half the can my hair looked no different. Still looked dirty. Felt a little slick to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never purchase this &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shampoo. Cornstarch baby powder does a far better job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various dry shampoos in the past. I have dark hair &amp; some leave a white powder but fortunately, this was not one of them. It sprays on clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have fine hair that can get weighed down easily. I sprayed it on lightly but it didn&#x27;t do much to improve my hair (this was from one day of not washing). When I sprayed more, it was left feeling weighed down &amp; dirty. As time when on, my hair just got greasier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not happy with the performance. I can&#x27;t comment on the nozzle clogging since I didn&#x27;t use it long enough. I do know many dry shampoos experience this issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many dry shampoos and I know what a good one can do so this was just not want I was expecting. I&#x27;ve read many reviews trying to find a good one but there are so many mixed reviews that I&#x27;m left wondering if they are even reviewing the same product?! So in order for this review to be helpful I have to mention what I am expecting and what this product did because ultimately that is what would help me find the product I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I expect and need: I have long hair and don&#x27;t want to wash my hair in 2 days when it gets a little greasy at the roots. So I need a product that does a good job at making hair look clean, by taking away the oiliness.  A little white residue doesn&#x27;t bother me, I can work with that. My primary need is to be clean-looking, not necessarily more volume, although sometimes that&#x27;s an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this product did: Absolutely nothing except to add more oiliness to it?! I don&#x27;t know why but when shook the can very well and sprayed at the roots and my hair came out flat and even more greasy than when I started. There was no powdery substance to it, it felt slick to the touch, my hands came away with a shininess to them when touching my roots and my hair was limp and gross. Maybe this product works for volume when hair is cleaner? That&#x27;s the only way I can think why some people have positive reviews.</li>
    <li> I loved the product when it did work but then the first bottle crapped out on me so I thought it was just defective, bought a second bottle it worked then the spray turned into a stream and it got all over the place!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Batiste brand and Suave and another brand that escapes me just now but of all of them, this one was best. The scent is decent and it really does make my hair look fresh and best of all, I have lots of body and can actually achieve certain styles that don&#x27;t work when my hair is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on, when I need a dry shampoo, this is my go to product. I thought the price was pretty good and a few good sprays worked so the bottle lasts me a decent amount of uses and I feel I get my money&#x27;s worth with it unlike the Batiste brand and it doesn&#x27;t stink to high heaven like Suave does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered more online since my local store doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore.  I like this dry shampoo better than the highly recommended salon brands that I have tried.  The ingredients are fairly simple and the scent is clean and minty. Best of all, it looks and feels clean in your hair.  You don&#x27;t get a ton of powder dumped into your hair that leaves it dull and heavy looking. It even passes my &amp;#34;scratch test&amp;#34; .  If you scratch your head, it doesn&#x27;t immediately leave clumps of oily powder product under your nails.  Great quality product for much less than salon brands!</li>
    <li> It is such a shame, I LOVED this stuff but like so many reviewers here I wasted most of it when the nozzle clogged and it stopped working. I have tried a ton of different dry shampoos: Batiste, Psst, Suave, Clean Freak etc and this one was my favorite. Lovely smell, didn&#x27;t leave my hair nearly as white as most, rubbed in well, took out the greasiness and left a bit of the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only the packaging was a good as the product :( I&#x27;m never buying this again, but I hear Rusk Invisible uses tapioca starch too so will try that next.</li>
    <li> Update: 3 uses before it clogged! I&#x27;ll be using tapioca starch - the active ingredient in this spray - on a cosmetic brush for now! And apply Before it gets oily!    Original: For fine, straight oily hair - This spray works amazingly! It leaves the stiff-ish texture of hairspray, and a little powdery feeling on the fingers if you run them through your hair, and a light scent my husband enjoys. On top of doing an excellent job of absorbing the oil, it gives me volume. This for me is huge, first because I can never use hair product for my fine, straight hair, or it will get oily. And second because my fine, straight hair gets oily by the evening of day 1 of washing. And third because my fine, straight hair is blonde and looks so dark and dull and limp when its oily. Instead of washing my hair every day, I am actually going 3 days in between washings! Yes! Beauty has become easier!    Just so you know, it doesn&#x27;t work for me once my hair is oily. I have to apply it before I get to that point: give my hair a good spraying at the roots all around where I care about preventing oil, and brush it through.    My one concern is the cost. While it works great, I don&#x27;t plan to use this all the time because this 4.9 oz spray only lasts me for a few weeks. [[ASIN:B0062W4T8O Suave Professionals Waterless Foam Shampoo]] is less expensive, but I have opted to use tapioca starch on a cosmetic brush instead,  because that seems to work as well as Suave. This brush method is really not at all as convenient as a spray, and it doesn&#x27;t have that nice hairspray volumizer-type effect, and honestly it doesn&#x27;t work as well as this fantastic Herbal Essences. But it costs a lot less, and money in my pocket is, well, money in my pocket. I&#x27;ll splurge on this Herbal Essences can once in a while but my cosmetic brush application will likely be my staple, unless the can gets more cost-effective.</li>
    <li> I was ready to wash my hair when this came in the mail. I sprayed this on my hair, and it made my hair light and fluffy. Instead of looking matted and stringy, it looked and smelled full and clean. I was not prepared for how well this worked. I wouldn&#x27;t say it made my hair look like it was just washed, and yet it definitely looked like it was clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells really good. It contains menthol and peppermint oil. It comes out feeling wet, and I had to be careful not to get this near my scalp, since I didn&#x27;t want my scalp to feel wet, not did I want to be spraying menthol and peppermint oil directly on my scalp, due to allergies to these ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this again but the second time, the sprayer was clogged and nothing would come out. I tried running hot water over the nozzle, but it didn&#x27;t help. It was hopelessly clogged. I was disappointed, since this worked so well and made my hair look so good the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if they could put this in a different type of delivery system this would be a great product.</li>
    <li> I did not have the defective bottle issue that some haver had. I haven&#x27;t ever used a dry shampoo before, but I received a sample with a shampoo purchase so I decided to try it out. I actually really like it!! My hair is on the thinner side and long, so it gets dirty fast. If I don&#x27;t wash it every day it looks greasy. This definitely helps me skip a day of washing. It adds volume to my hair and it looks noticeably cleaner after I use it. I usually throw it up in a ponytail after I give it a good spray and my hair looks clean and not like it&#x27;s slicked back and greasy. I highly recommend this product- especially if you are a mom on the go like me and sometimes your toddler doesn&#x27;t give you 5 minutes to jump in the shower before you have to be out the door!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I have medium-thick dark blonde hair that is very dry and only gets oily after about 3 days of skipping washes. I bought this stuff about three months ago at a local drug store. The first night I used it, my hair had gone through about 4 days of no shampoo and was heavy and oily at the roots. I sprayed this stuff on my roots and it made my hair there stiff, white, and didn&#x27;t absorb ANY. OIL. AT. ALL. I threw it in my bathroom cabinet and thought, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll just use it when I absoleutely can&#x27;t get away without it.&amp;#34; About a week later, I used it again (or at least I tried to) and I shook the bottle up and prepared to spray it in my roots, and I heard a sloshing. I went ahead and sprayed the stuff in my hair. Bad idea. I felt a heavy wet feeling on my scalp and thought, &amp;#34;This should be good.&amp;#34; It turns out, the aerosol dry shampoo had turned into liquid dry shampoo...!!!! A few days ago, went to use this and thought, &amp;#34;I can just spray it into my hand and rub into the roots. I attempted to use it, and the nozzle was clogged and wouldn&#x27;t even work! ONLY AFTER THREE USES!!!! This stuff may be only five bucks, but spend the money on something worthwhile please.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to buy nicer shampoo and wash my hair less frequently to keep it healthy and prevent it from falling out. This is my 3rd dry shampoo (Batiste, Not your mother&#x27;s clean freak, and Herbal essences). I have to say, this product is the nicest of the 3, although from other reviews, I am a little anxious about the bottle clogging. Just a note, the dry shampoos tend to be overpriced on Amazon. Just buy it at the drugstore and save yourself some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last place. Overall, I thought NYMCF was terrible in every way, feeling more like hairspray than a dry shampoo and making my hair split, looking even dirtier. I bought a travel size at CVS so I could take it on a plane and it really didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It not only made my hair look oily, it also made it feel greasier and I basically threw the bottle out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd place. Batiste was the very first dry shampoo I ever used and have continued to purchase over the yrs, usually at TJ Maxx at a discount. It works very well to absorb oil and they have tinted shampoos so the white residue isn&#x27;t a problem. My only gripe is that it makes my hair feel REALLY heavy and nappy after spraying this on, like I just put a TON of texture powder all over it. I would get really self-conscious about anyone touching my hair since it felt so terrible. The smell also lingered way too long and didn&#x27;t really smell fresh, just overly perfumey, which was also what spurred me to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st place. All bottle issues aside, I think Herbal Essences has the best dry shampoo formula. It goes on absolutely clear and very light. The smell is a typical HE shampoo smell, but the best improvement is that my hair feels really LIGHT and clean, like I just took a shower. Since the smell is also of shampoo and not a perfume poured into a dry shampoo, it really tricks you into thinking you just washed your hair. If the bottle lasts, this will be my new go-to, and at $5, it&#x27;s a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note, I also looked over Dove and Suave dry shampoo at the drugstore and couldn&#x27;t purchase it because just the smell/fragrance coming off the nozzle was too overpowering for me.</li>
    <li> free of parabens &amp; dyes. Shake it, shake it thoroughly, spray on, into roots and surface, then Brush out. It left no residue which made it a total winner. I use it when running late because my hair takes 60 minutes to wash, blow dry and style (thick curly color treated dry Irish neck length hair). Make sure to follow the directions closely to avoid an epic fail</li>
