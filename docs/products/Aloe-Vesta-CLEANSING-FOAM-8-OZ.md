<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this cleasining foam.  It has so many uses.  I use it to wash my elderly mother&#x27;s hair since she is currently on bed rest.</li>
    <li> Smells good, sudsy yet easy to rinse. Great for shampoo, too. Leaves hair shiny and clean with minimal rinsing with a wet washcloth.</li>
    <li> Nice and moist! not to harsh on sensitive skins!</li>
    <li> I had a dorsal spinal stimulator implanted in my back; I was in the VA hospital for 5 days.  Since the controller for the trial unit is wired outside of the back, I was not allowed to shower.  I saw good ratings for Aloe Vesta, and my husband was given Aloe Vesta, when he  had his knee replaced.  I&#x27;m thankful for the Aloe Vesta.  It smells clean, but not overwhelming, and more importantly, it cleans good.  I was able to get out of bed, so I was able to use the sink, but I was not allowed to shower.  I have long hair which reaches the middle of my back (to my bra line);  I cleaned my hair daily, using the directions on the Aloe Vesta.  The Aloe Vesta cleaned my hair enough to make it look presentable and clean.  Also, it left it conditioned enough that I was able to comb it out easily, which was a surprise.  It wasn&#x27;t the same as showering, but it was enough that I felt comfortable, which was the important thing.  It also cleaned my body very well.  I loved the smell.  Thank you Aloe Vesta!</li>
    <li> Stuff is awesome. It was given to my husband after he had open heart surgery. I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Use this a lot, foams up great, gets the job done with no irritation.</li>
    <li> I was looking at another item when I reviewed this previously, so my response didn&#x27;t make any sense. I was so happy to find this product on line. After my recent hospital stay I came home with this product. I tried it on my grandson&#x27;s hair and it was like a miracle. He is always so afraid to have his hair washed, but without a lot of suds washing went easily and without fear. It worked well as a body wash for his very sensitive skin too.</li>
    <li> They used this in the hospital when I broke my femur. Since I&#x27;ve been out I use it every day. I like to use it with a washcloth and a bucket of water for a sponge bath. It leaves the skin feeling nice and smelling clean.</li>
    <li> Great for my handicap disable brother when he has a bed day and need to do&lt;br /&gt;A bed bath.</li>
    <li> Works great. Same as the hospital.</li>
    <li> I use Aloe Vesta cleansing foam when I go camping in areas where there is no water for showers. I have use the foam when the temperature has been as low as 40 degree above zero and it works fine. The foam evaporate quickly so you do not need a towel to dry yourself.</li>
    <li> I had used all the one bottle I got from hospital. I used it for everything. I was so glad I could get it. It is great.</li>
    <li> First used in hospital</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I discovered these products (different brand) during a hospital stay of several days, during which they brought me a &amp;#34;shower cap&amp;#34; except I wasn&#x27;t allowed to shower; the instructions were to put it on my head, massage it around, take it off.  I was amazed.  No rinsing needed.  My hair was wet but really clean.  So I checked some products &amp; chose this one which is more versatile for at home situations.  I use it on hair when some parts are a bit dirty but I don&#x27;t want to wash all my hair, &amp; on skin.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping my 93 year old mom skin clean. Smells great. Highly recommend it. Would buy again. Used in most hospitals.</li>
    <li> Recommended to continue use (Aloe Vesta products) by nursing home (post surgically) after my Grandmothers PT rehab discharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was nervous about traditional bathing regularly after returning home (lives alone) and this particular product was not easy to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came quick, well packaged at a good price and she was delighted to have it!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product for those with limited mobility, even just to freshen up between complete bathing.</li>
    <li> My patient loved this as she has very sensitive skin, good price</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to water and have to sponge in between time.  I only can take a shower every third day. So Aloe Vesta Cleansing foam really comes in handy and I feel CLEAN.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Very pleasant and useful product for handicapped. I keep it next to the bidet and it&#x27;s very convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Use this regularly on toilet tissue to clean myself - it is better for the septic system, cheaper, and I can layer the tissues as necessary.  Helps me feel clean between showers.</li>
    <li> I use it periodically on a bedridden patient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a caretaker for my 86 year old aunt and when she was in a care center, they used the cleansing foam.  She really liked that it cleansed so completely and was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are now using it at home and it is something we both would not be without.</li>
    <li> Plain water works much better</li>
    <li> i like this product. really does work on hair too which is very helpful. there are other non rinse soaps but they don&#x27;t say to use on hair too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am a heavy guy and cleaning up in those certain places is very hard sometimes. My wife had this used on her while in the hospital and&lt;br /&gt;really liked it. So we decided to buy some. This foam works great and leaves you feeling really clean.Give it a try. A++++++++++++for&lt;br /&gt;me.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this faithfully.  He has bone cancer and his skin is very sensitive.  Aloe Vesta is soothing and not harmful to his skin.</li>
    <li> Ideal for personal hygiene when traveling or at home.</li>
    <li> Very good for use when unable to take daily showers due to medical conditions. Would highly recommend. Use it frequently for my elderly Mother. Also used in most hospitals. No skin issues with long or short term use.</li>
    <li> Its a a bit pricey but I know my daughter who wears diapers 24/7 gets her bottom well cleaned.</li>
    <li> I had a stay in the hospital in April 2015 and I used this product there and loved it. It&#x27;s not drying to my skin. Pump works great!</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product.  I had used another one from Medline before &amp; although I really liked it, I decided to try this one.  It has a nice scent, cleans good &amp; is gentle enough for all over, everyday use.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry &amp; itching .</li>
    <li> When a bed ridden  person can not get up an take a shower this has been great .</li>
    <li> My husband had a serious fall last February and isn&#x27;t able to shower.  This product is great for cleaning everything including hair without having to rinse.  They used this product while he was in the hospital also.  The only problem I had with this order is that all three of the bottles leaked into the plastic sleeves they were packaged in.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, and you don&#x27;t have to rinse it off and it does such a wonderful job leaving the body clean.</li>
    <li> THE BEST PRODUCT. I&#x27;VE BEEN USING FOR SOME TIME. EXELENT</li>
    <li> Great for winter when it is too cold to take a bath or shower.  Also good if one is incapacitated for any reason.  Makes one feel as if one has had a complete shower or bath.  No strong scent, just a very mild pleasant one -- does not even bother my sensitive allergies to scents.  I have purchased it for friends as well as myself.</li>
    <li> Works well, very gentle.</li>
    <li> We learned of this product while in hospital recovering from a fractured hip.  It&#x27;s a marvelous cleanser--foamy soap and mild, and very little is used during a shower.  Never knew about it before.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!  I bought this for my grandmother who has very delicate skin.  This is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Mom used Aloe Vesta during her hospital stay.  It worked so well that we now keep in in our hurricane supply box.  We may get hot without electricity but we can get clean without using out valuable water supply!</li>
    <li> Nice foam, easy to use</li>
    <li> Very nice but expensive</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised; excellent for cleaning whatever ails you. Thanks</li>
    <li> I use this cleansing foam with disposable wet bath wipes squirting a small amount on it.  It seems to cover and clean a lot better.  Will reorder soon.</li>
    <li> If you are a diabetic or have a concern about germs this is your answer.wash hands 100 times a day and they still remain soft.</li>
    <li> favorite for camping.  My husband&#x27;s favorite soap, ever.  Wish it were slightly cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Much easier to work with instead of the spray.</li>
    <li> It was Great!!! I shared it with my family and have plans  to submit a New order.</li>
    <li> This cleanser works great for anyone with sensitive skin. My wife is absolutely hooked on it!</li>
    <li> Great for elder care.</li>
    <li> Only one my husband can use without irritation</li>
    <li> I had a stroke and have limited use of left arm/hand.  Pump is great.  Cleansing of body is great.&lt;br /&gt;Terrific!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my dad. He had used it in the hospital following surgery. Wasn&#x27;t sure I could find it. Glad I did. He uses this on his dry skin and loves it.</li>
    <li> When you run out keep the bottles and buy the spray to put into the pump bottle. The spray is cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great item. I just bought liquid and put in the foam version bottle as refill and it foams great. Liquid is less expensive but I like foam for more controlled application . So save foam bottles and buy liquid . Sane great product!!!</li>
    <li> it did not form but the same one from the hospital did--I really liked it when it fomed but when i ordered the sale thing it can out as soapy water</li>
    <li> This product will allow you to skip the every day shower routine.  It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found for cleaning sensitive areas and does not leave a heavy perfume scent.  It glides on and no rinsing is needed.  This is a great product for those with dry skin who should avoid too much oil-robbing soap and water. I only wish they produced a smaller portable size for after sports use.</li>
    <li> Learned about this product when my baby was in NICU. Now we use it at home for diaper changes and cleansing in between baths. Great product to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Works well, but is pricey.</li>
    <li> Great product! Did exactly what it advertised multi purpose. Worked well as a hair cleaning product too.</li>
    <li> very useful for personal hygiene especially when travelling with children and seniors</li>
    <li> I was 1st introduced to it in the hospital, liked it so much bought more on Amazon for home.</li>
    <li> A delicate scented cleanser that needs no water leaves no residue.</li>
