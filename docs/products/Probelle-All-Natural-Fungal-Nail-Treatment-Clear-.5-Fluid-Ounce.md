      <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s all natural, using the anti-fungal property of coconut oil.</li>
      <li>I will update this review as I have more extended experience with Probelle because I am thrilled to have found a product that works.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t a brush type applicator (like nail polish) make more sense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Takes a good 2 months to see results but its worth the wait.</li>
      <li>The softening of the nail should begin the healing process by being able to cut more</li>
      <li>ok works</li>
      <li>Better</li>
      <li>It is turning the toenail sort of whitish, which is better than the brownish line that it had on it before I started, about 1/3 of my toenail was darker in color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Natural Product makes me feel even better when using it.</li>
      <li>He tried many types of treatment and most had been ineffective.</li>
      <li>to find it on amazon as it is more convenient for me to buy it here.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am giving it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for 90 days</li>
      <li>Usually most treatments take over a month to show results</li>
      <li>Believe me, I would love to give this 5 stars and have this all taken care of, but for now it&#x27;s a 4.</li>
      <li>I dropped a pallet on it many years ago.</li>
      <li>The product description does say it may require more than one botle to achieve the desired resuts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>the texture of the nail is much better.  </li>
      <li>I was able to do this because most of the nail separated from the toe bed.</li>
      <li>My nail fungus was getting better but within 2 days of using Probelle it flared up again.</li>
      <li>It may take more than one emery board.  </li>
      <li>I decided to just let it be for a while, and also started going barefoot more than I ever had before.</li>
      <li>I was freaked out, for sure.</li>
      <li>I noticed one nail was much better within 3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>You may be able to get it shorter each time you cut it.  </li>
      <li>My nails started to look better after three days.</li>
      <li>The effect lasts most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used up the product in the bottle, and my toe was looking pretty good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the problem for over 10 years, but at best this product doesn&#x27;t dry out the flesh around the nail.  </li>
      <li>A very good product, but it does take a while to work so patience is necessary.</li>
      <li>After using this stuff for the full month - I am going to say that my toes look better - a lot better.</li>
      <li>I was hopeful for good results, but I do not see much improvement.  </li>
      <li>Quick, easy, and painless!</li>
      <li>I also like the convenient dropper type dispenser which is easy to administer.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>product is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Works well and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easily applied -</li>
      <li>The product is easily applied to the nail with a dropper.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>anyone who has used chemical-laden anti-fungal treatments, you will know that they tend to have a relatively strong odor.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many others and this one is the most effective I have used so far.  </li>
      <li>, I think 90 days is a better time frame to make a full blown assessment.</li>
      <li>(I think that would take a year or more to truly make that call, but it really seems to be most effective at this point on my nails that have more recently developed with fungus or keep those that aren&#x27;t, from developing the fungus since it is something that spreads almost too easily.  </li>
      <li>but I am really happy to have finally found a product that works.</li>
      <li>It is important to let it sit/dry for about 10 minutes before putting socks on, which I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s not sticky at all.</li>
      <li>I’ve been using this for a month now, and to be honest, I haven’t noticed much of a change.</li>
      <li>There are prescription meds available, but they have side effects.  </li>
      <li>As I see fit I will update this review.</li>
      <li>I would like to know how to tell if the fungus is gone, for instance; what products would be compatible for use with the Probelle, such as moisturizers and polishes, and what side effects people have experienced.</li>
      <li>I have used many products and none have ever worked, this product is definetly worth it, plus you cannot beat the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Is great and different from a lot&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 3-1/2 weeks, and so far, so good.</li>
      <li>I like it and am confident it takes the right approach for a long-term solution.</li>
      <li>It cleared up the issue quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing significant improvements in my nails.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m very pleased with my results so far.</li>
      <li>White vinegar is somewhat effective against the fungus(seriously), although you may develop a craving for salad!  </li>
      <li>After two weeks, I tried trimming it again, and this time the nail clippers were able to go right through it quickly and without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quite the opposite as this is safe &amp; effective.</li>
      <li>The power of coconut oil and improving your health is far reaching, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>The eye-dropper is clumsy at best.  </li>
      <li>She probably needs additional treatments for complete fungus removal but the product is effective.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The jury is still out on this one.  I have not completed an entire bottle yet, so I am not quite sure if it will improve my nails.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> working, aslow and steady</li>
    <li> Helped a bit, awaiting further results.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Worked quickly to fix my one encounter with a messed up toenail.  Quick, easy, and painless!</li>
    <li> This product claims to cure nail fungus.  But this is not true, it made my toe nail worse...  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product!!!! I&#x27;d highly recommend. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> Very happy to have found probelle fungal nail treatment on amazon for less money that my local pharmacy store. I have been using this product for 3 consecutive months and my nail is almost at its natural state. I have used many products and none have ever worked, this product is definetly worth it, plus you cannot beat the price. If you need it, do not think about it, this product really works. Just bought another one!</li>
    <li> This is a very slow process. After 5 weeks, there is very little change in nails after following directions.  Time try something else.</li>
    <li> I believe that Probelle’s natural fungal nail treatment will do the job in treating my problem toe nail. The fungus cause to nail to grow upward and the podiatrist cut as much as she was able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t believe the Probelle treatment will cure my fungus anytime soon but I do believe that the formula, heavily laced with coconut oil will soften the nail and make it possible to cut more of the nail away. Then as the nail grows the fungus will slowly recede. The softening of the nail should begin the healing process by being able to cut more away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to use. Just apply on the troubled nail using an eye drop applicator and let it dry before putting socks on. Do this twice a day. The liquid applied to the nail is clear and non-scented. I like it and am confident it takes the right approach for a long-term solution.</li>
    <li> I have been very sporadic at using this, only once a day, and not every day.  Still, in three weeks I saw a noticeable improvement in my little toe.  I stopped using it a couple of weeks ago (forgetful, lazy) and my toenail continues to improve.  I liked that there was no odor or physical discomfort.  I put in on in the mornings and walked around barefoot until it dried.  It was very easy to use.</li>
    <li> First, I love finding new uses for coconut oil—it&#x27;s such a terrific substance.  Obviously there are other ingredients in here as well.  I&#x27;ve suffered with one toenail that I&#x27;ve tried other products, soaking in epsom salt, etc.  I&#x27;ve been using this nail treatment daily and it IS helping to soften the nail so it can grow out without causing me more pain.  It does take a while to dry but I put it on while watching TV so that&#x27;s not a problem.  During the day I&#x27;ve even applied it and after waiting 5-10 minutes put on a pair of socks to contain any transfer of the treatment oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I age I&#x27;ve noticed that my toenails are becoming thicker and starting to discolor a little—this product helps to keep them more pliable, whiter, and overall healthier looking.  Now I&#x27;m going to get my husband to start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the dropper and think the bottle will last quite a long time.  Good value and good product.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> not effective for me.</li>
    <li> I had a small fungus on one nail. I&#x27;ve used this natural product for over 3 weeks and I can definitely see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no odor or unpleasant smell. I used Probelle All Natural Fungal Nail Treatment twice a day as directed and it didn&#x27;t dry out my nail or cuticle - in fact they look great. I will recommend Probelle highly!!!</li>
    <li> working well so far!!</li>
    <li> After using this stuff for the full month - I am going to say that my toes look better - a lot better. I think you&#x27;d need to use it longer than a month for the full effect, but I only have a month before I have to review it. It is turning the toenail sort of whitish, which is better than the brownish line that it had on it before I started, about 1/3 of my toenail was darker in color. The whitish skin around the toes that I though was just dry skin, but is actually a part of the fungus issue, is practically gone. It&#x27;s easily applied - you do have to wait a bit to walk around on carpet etc, as it is oily and could get on things. I put it on with my foot on a towel on the ottoman and then wait a bit for it to absorb - usually watch television or read or something during that time. Then I wipe the bottom of my feet before I walk around. I am giving it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for 90 days, I think 90 days is a better time frame to make a full blown assessment. Based on what I&#x27;ve seen, I&#x27;ll be back to re-assess the review in 60 days and up it to 5 stars if I see even more results.  UPDATE: I think it helped to thin out the nail, but it turned it white, which was very noticeable, I&#x27;ve stopped using it for now, but the nail is already seeming to grow out more normal. I&#x27;ve got the bottle standing by in case the nail starts thickening again. I&#x27;d say buy it and give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks.  I have tried many others and this one is the most effective I have used so far.  Its been a long battle with the nail issues and I&#x27;ve learned a lot during those months.  I have read a lot and seen a lot of suggestions.  I&#x27;m going to list the suggestions...keep in mind that I&#x27;m not a doctor but these suggestions have proven results for me. First, two &#x27;cons&#x27; on this product.  1) My cuticle peeled off several times while using.  Not a big issues but it may happen.  2)  It comes with a &#x27;dropper&#x27; for application when a small brush would be much more effective at targeting and to eliminate product waste.  I poured mine into an old bottle that came with a small brush.  you can then &#x27;paint&#x27; it on rather than drip it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions from experience:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Your nail(s) is likely to be very thick as a result of the fungus.  The best suggestion I have seen is to take an emery board and sand down the entire nail surface until is is very thin.  It may take more than one emery board.  This allows the product to penetrate the nail more easily, not having to work its way through the thick nail surface. The fungus lives under the nail.  You will have to repeat the sanding of the nail surface several times since it will thicken naturally and as a result of still live fungus. Thinner nail surface is the most effective tool against the fungus that I came up with.&lt;br /&gt;2) Cut you nail as short as you can get it. You may be able to get it shorter each time you cut it.  This means less area for fungus to live.&lt;br /&gt;3) Use product at least twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;4) White vinegar is somewhat effective against the fungus(seriously), although you may develop a craving for salad!  Just kidding,&lt;br /&gt;5) Keep using it for several months even after it appears that the fungus is gone.  The fungus is tough and will come back easily.</li>
    <li> It works, enough said.</li>
    <li> it seems to work. slow but working ..</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Just had a small spot on one toe to get rid of.. After weeks of applying no difference was noted .</li>
    <li> This product takes some time but it works! The first changes I felt were no more pain and itching. After 3 weeks it&#x27;s when the color was removed completely. I will continue the use until it is completely healed. I do use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Update after ~4 months of use: There has been no further improvement in the appearance on my toenails, nor has the fungal infection receded. Like other non-prescription remedies I&#x27;ve tried, I have to conclude that it can&#x27;t eradicate the fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review: Though it&#x27;s too early to declare victory over a stubborn case of toenail fungus that I&#x27;ve been living with for years, there is definitely noticeable improvement in the appearance of the nails after using this product twice a day for about 3 weeks. I have tried many nail / fungal solutions over the years, and none have been successful, even after many months of use. I still do have hope that Probelle will work. It is an unscented, clear oil that if applied with the included glass dropper. I use a q-tip to rub it around and push it into the cuticle area and under the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Probelle oil softens the nails and surrounding cuticles and tissue. This allowed me to trim and file the nails back almost to the quick, exposing the edge of the nailbed so that I could apply more of the oil directly to the infected area. Softening of the cuticle allows me to push the cuticles back and expose more of the healthy part of each nailbed. It does seem that the pink new growth is expanding and pushing out the yellowish infected area. Just to be sure, I am photographing the nails weekly with a high resolution camera, and will report results again later when I see more progress (Amazon requires Vine users to post reviews within 30 days of receipt of a product which is a bit too soon for a longer acting product such as this.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Probelle nightly for about 2-3 months. It does make the nail look a lot better, but as an experiment I stopped using it for a few days, and the nail was back to its disgusting self within a few days. I suspect the product is works cosmetically, but really does nothing curative.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> Well, I have been using this product for almost a month.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think that any nail fungus treatment will cure the problem in that length of time.  I was hopeful for good results, but I do not see much improvement.  I am unable to tolerate the oral prescription meds that are sometimes prescribed for toenail fungus.  Of course I have used over the counter Fungi-Nail, as suggested by my doctor, with the same results.  Ditto for using tea tree oil.  And Vicks.  And soaking my feet in Listerine.  I&#x27;ve had the problem for over 10 years, but at best this product doesn&#x27;t dry out the flesh around the nail.  But I will continue to use it, and will update my review if I see any real improvement.</li>
    <li> This works well; my wife has used it for a month, and has noticed a definite improvement.  She has tried several OTC treatments and one prescription treatment; none worked. It is easy to apply.  Usually most treatments take over a month to show results so this is good news.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes the nails whiter just foes not get rid of the fungus.</li>
    <li> In only 5 days my black discolored toenails are now almost totally clear after countless years of other purchased products including prescriptions.  I also like the convenient dropper type dispenser which is easy to administer.  I am purchasing a 2nd bottle even though there is plenty left so I do not run out because I do not know if you stop usage, once the problem has cleared up, if it would return.</li>
    <li> My wife decided to be the guinea pig for this foot fungus experiment....so here is the verdict - It worked up to a point. It&#x27;s difficult to tell whether it worked better or worse than other products and of course promoting something as &amp;#34;all-Natural&amp;#34; means very little. Suffice it to say it did no harm and did a little good. She probably needs additional treatments for complete fungus removal but the product is effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a couple of weeks, so I can&#x27;t be objective about the long term results.  So far, it has lightened the discoloration on the nail and has softened the keratin under the nail making for easier removal.  Long term?  I can&#x27;t say.</li>
    <li> For a friend, he doesn&#x27;t give me a feedback. But I found a lot good feedback , so I make a try.</li>
    <li> I’ve had nail fungus under the nails of both big toes for some time.  I have tried numerous home remedies with little results.  I refused to fill the prescription my doctor provided because of the poor results other users were reporting and the unpleasant side effects.  In short, up to this point, I have found nothing that really worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Probelle Nail Fungus for about three weeks now.  I use it twice daily as recommended.  There has been a marked improvement in the looks of the nails.  The nails are certainly not cured but they do look much better and I will assume that with continued use, the fungus will clear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point there have been no observable side effects.  There is no odor from the Probelle Nail Fungus.  I apply 3-4 drops to the affected nail and then let it air dry for 15-20 minutes.  There is no stain on my socks or any other problem.  I like the fact that this is an all-natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one big thing I dislike about the Probelle Nail Fungus is it is applied by a eye-drop type dispenser.  The eye-dropper is clumsy at best.  It is difficult to spread the liquid evenly.  I am not sure why they did not use a brush applicator.  It seems like it would have been a more effective applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used almost half the bottle.  The directions indicate that it might take up to 60 days to completely eliminate the nail fungus.  This would be much better than any other remedy I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am satisfied that the Probelle Nail Fungus is showing progress.  I will continue using and am certainly willing to invest in another bottle so long as I see progress.</li>
    <li> I have been using this once a day for about 20 days.  And although it *appears* to be working (I wish I had taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture), it hasn&#x27;t gone away yet.  Believe me, I would love to give this 5 stars and have this all taken care of, but for now it&#x27;s a 4.</li>
    <li> Had no positive effect on my nails, actually dried the, out more</li>
    <li> Works great, noticeable difference in 2 wks</li>
    <li> I had such high expectations on this product. I really thought this would save my toe nails, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t help at all. Such a waste of money! I used to put twice a day, one in the morning and another one at night, until I finished it all. My nails look worse than when I started the treatment with this product.</li>
    <li> The power of coconut oil and improving your health is far reaching, it&#x27;s amazing how many uses this natural oil can benefit you.  I&#x27;m thankful for the opportunity to try this natural treatment on my nail problem.  I have seen an improvement in the appearance of my toenails, even though I quite often forget to apply it a second time each day.  I am about finished with the first bottle, and plan to order another. Since nail fungus is in the nail bed itself, I usually use a fair amount of this over the entire nail area... I don&#x27;t know that it will cure all of my nails (I think that would take a year or more to truly make that call, but it really seems to be most effective at this point on my nails that have more recently developed with fungus or keep those that aren&#x27;t, from developing the fungus since it is something that spreads almost too easily.  I will continue to use this product since I am seeing a difference in the 4 weeks I have been using it.</li>
    <li> I have not really used this product since buying it.  I had been using tree tea oil and that seems to be working great,  so, I delayed on using this</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to apply. It cleared up the issue quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> This product does the job.  The time it takes varies, however, as nail size and thickness differ.  I noticed one nail was much better within 3 weeks.  The other is looking better, but will definitely take longer to clear up.  Easy to use, my only complaint is that it seems oily, and stays on the surface of the nail for about 10-15 minutes, so don&#x27;t plan to put socks or shoes on immediately after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you want to be sure to cover the entire nail, and get the sides and underneath the top of the nail too.  Good product, beats using prescription meds.</li>
    <li> I think the biggest selling point for this product is its all natural pedigree, which is infinitely preferable to applying something that&#x27;s chock full of chemical after chemical that I can&#x27;t pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this once a day for three weeks now, and the one change that I&#x27;ve noticed is that the nail is quite a bit thinner: I had tried trimming it prior to the point when I first started using this (on a big toe, for what that&#x27;s worth), and the nail was so thick that it took a fair amount of elbow grease to actually cut it.  After two weeks, I tried trimming it again, and this time the nail clippers were able to go right through it quickly and without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the downsides, I can say that the thinning of the nail is really pretty much the only effect this product has had, at least thus far.  The darkness at the base of the nail may be the tiniest bit lighter, but the difference is so negligible that I can&#x27;t in all honesty say that it&#x27;s a positive change that this product has brought about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the application, the glass dropper makes it easy to put as much of the product as one wants on at any given time.  However, that&#x27;s also got a downside, because it&#x27;s not something that you can easily maneuver to get under the nail, for example; to do that, you&#x27;ve got to reach for the Q-tips in order to get the treatment exactly where it needs to go.  A little bit of the product does go a long way, as it&#x27;s easy to spread around in that manner.  Consequently, even after 3 weeks, the bottle I have is still mostly full, so this will last a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once applied, you really do have to wait at least 10-15 minutes before putting on socks and/or shoes, because this stuff stays wet for a long time.  In fact, even after that allotted time has passed, the area won&#x27;t be completely dry and there will be a very slight tacky feel where the treatment had been sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has used chemical-laden anti-fungal treatments, you will know that they tend to have a relatively strong odor.  This product does not; it&#x27;s not completely odorless, but the smell is very faint, so it&#x27;s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging from some other reviews that I&#x27;ve read, some people have had issues with this seeming to cause rashes and other skin problems.  My skin is extremely (annoyingly) sensitive, but I can say that this hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line as far my experience with this is concerned is that it&#x27;s definitely thinned the nail, but that&#x27;s about it.  It could be for that for some people, it takes quite a bit longer than 3 weeks to notice some of the great benefits that others have mentioned, so I will keep using this until the product runs out.  As of right now, I can say that this product is okay, but in terms of its overall effectiveness, it&#x27;s currently leaving a lot to be desired.</li>
    <li> Appears to be making a difference. However, second order will be a replacement- as it appears to have started to crystallize in bottle.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this for a month now, and to be honest, I haven’t noticed much of a change. My nails look better immediately after applying the product, because it soaks into the nail and makes the damaged parts less obvious. The effect lasts most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said there’s a lot left in the bottle and I’ll continue to use it until the bottle is empty, and will update this review (and the rating) at that time with the results. Ordinarily I wouldn’t write a review so soon, but the product was provided to me to review and I&#x27;m required to write a review within a month. So stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients (as provided by the manufacturer) are: propylene glycol, glyceryl, propylene glycol monolaurate, glyceryl monolaurate, potassium laurate, propylene glycol dilaurate, glyceryl dilaurate, water, potassium hydroxide.</li>
    <li> Great product. It took care of my toenail fungus completely in 9 weeks. Two bottles and now I am ready for summertime!!</li>
    <li> I broke the Metatarsal and Phalange bones in my left foot 2-years ago, also damaged the toenail. Eventually, the toenail detached…a new toenail has since grown. The new toenail has been plagued by fungus. I have tried a few things including oral antifungal drugs, but the fungus seems to return. The fungus causes my nail to yellow and peel. I have been using this product for just under 2 weeks. The fungus is not completely gone, but the yellowing of the nail has been significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is oily…applied with a dropper.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my mom who has yellow under her toes. She has tried everything before it seems like and was happy to let me try this out on her.She has been using it for a week now and she has noticed a slight difference so far, which is why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars since I want to give it more time to work. It is very easy to apply and there is no chemical scent to it. She said she likes the results so far and will continue to use. I feel too like her toe is definitely softer, not rock solid like it was.</li>
    <li> Not the best to use but is working</li>
    <li> Best.thing.ever! So happy to have found thus product. After years of struggling with nail fungus, it&#x27;s completely gone within only a couple months. I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with one of my fingernails for years. I&#x27;ve tried several remedies, home and prescription, and the fungus starts to disappear, but almost always, it comes back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wasn&#x27;t having a lot of hope for Probelle, since I&#x27;ve tried so many things that promised to cure this and failed. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3-1/2 weeks, and so far, so good. The fungus is disappearing; my nail is stronger and the pain is going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll report back if this solves the problem for good. I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic!</li>
    <li> ...but nobody really wants to deal with an icky nail fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost a year ago I got a puncture wound to one of my toes and the nail bed was damaged.  As the nail grew back it didn&#x27;t look quite right - yellowish color, bumps and ridges - so I consulted an expert.  No, not a doctor - my friend that owns a spa!  Diagnosis:  Nail fungus.  She wasn&#x27;t optimistic.  Seems over-the-counter meds take a long time to work, that&#x27;s IF they work at all.  There are prescription meds available, but they have side effects.  So...what to do?  Was I doomed to walk around with an ugly nail for the rest of my days?  I live in flip-flops; I wear them from the time the snow melts until the first frost. &amp;#34;Old Yeller&amp;#34; has got to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Probelle twice a day for nearly three weeks now, and I&#x27;ve seen a big improvement.  The color of the nail is *almost* back to normal and the texture of the nail is much better.  I think the product is definitely working, but I&#x27;ve been doing a few other things as well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*keep the nail as short as you comfortably can&lt;br /&gt;*file down the thickness of the nail, but don&#x27;t get carried away&lt;br /&gt;*try to avoid nail polish as much as possible while you&#x27;re treating the nail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m very happy with the results, I am experiencing one side effect:  the product is making my skin dry and flaky.  I&#x27;ve been using a vitamin E oil to counteract the dryness, and that seems to work pretty well.  I also don&#x27;t care for the dropper style applicator - you end up wasting a lot of product and getting it on skin that doesn&#x27;t need to be treated.  Wouldn&#x27;t a brush type applicator (like nail polish) make more sense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  The product is working for me and I plan to continue using it.  The side effects are mild. The product has no odor, dries quickly and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it.  I suspect that results will vary based on the extent of the problem (how many nails are involved) as well as how long you&#x27;ve had the fungus.</li>
    <li> I recently had laser treatment for toenail fungus. The doctor prescribed medication to use for followup treatment but when I got to the pharmacy, I learned that it would cost $500. I did not buy it so when I saw the Probelle All Natural Fungal Nail Treatment offered for review, I decided to try it instead. I am all for using natural treatment whenever possible and I already knew that one of the main ingredients, coconut oil, was known to help eliminate nail fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I cannot determine if the Probelle treatment will totally eliminate nail fungus since it takes months for the damaged nail to grow out. But I believe I can actually see a positive difference in the affected nail since I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is clear and has very little discernible odor. It is somewhat thick and dries fairly quickly. The product is easily applied to the nail with a dropper. I personally would have preferred a brush applicator such as in fingernail polish but that is only a minor issue. Overall, I would recommend at least giving the Probelle treatment a try before resorting to more expensive and possibly risky prescription treatments.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Will update in about a month. Have been using it for about 5 weeks or so</li>
    <li> ok works well I think</li>
    <li> I purchased this as it seems that I have just begun with the toenail fungus. One must have a lot of patience as it takes forever to dry. No brush included which would have made it easier to apply. I would not purchase again. Save your money and get a prescription.</li>
    <li> Actually works. Very good product!</li>
    <li> I decided to wait on writing a review. It&#x27;s been about 10 days since I started using this. Both of my big toes looked terrible. One worse than the other. I was freaked out, for sure. I&#x27;ve applied twice or more daily. My nails started to look better after three days. The yellow is completely gone but I will have to slowly clip off the nail as my new nails grow out but I don&#x27;t feel subconscious as before. Not sure this is a miracle but I&#x27;m very pleased with my results so far. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Looks like it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> no results as indicated in literature</li>
    <li> Two weeks in and I feel no more pain plus I yellow coloring is gone, its working and plan to continue with more purchases until fungus its gone.</li>
    <li> Does not work!! It optically hides the fungas discoloration but that&#x27;s about it. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work too well for me.</li>
    <li> This product does not work....period...end of story.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband as we really like using natural products. I am very impressed that I have seen very fast results with this product. My husband has been using this product for only 7 days now, applying it twice a day, the pain has been reduced to a minimum. I Very much recommend this product for people that have the same issue as my husband, we really tried a lot of products and this is the first one to actually work on him.</li>
    <li> Probelle fungus treatment is the best product I have tried. Fungus has built up for a long time in toes and I have used numerous natural treatments with no results. This product has no scent and no color. Better yet it actually works! This is my second bottle and I am just amazed by the results. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> Seems to be cosmetic only..  What I mean is, you apply it, your toes look good for most of the day, but then by the end of the day, they look like their old, fungus-ed selves. I bought two bottles of this stuff, each time the bottle lasted me just over two weeks..  In that one month+ period, I didn&#x27;t see much in the day of long term improvement.</li>
    <li> YES YES YES!!!  Finally a product that works!  I recommend this to anyone with stubborn nail fungus.  Softens the nail and normal  color and shape have returned.  Buy this!</li>
    <li> My wife has a bad big toe on her left toe so she was looking forward to trying this. She has been using it every day for the last 3 weeks plus and there is a noticeable change. We took a picture each day on her cell phone so we could look back and see if there was a big, little or no change. It is hardly near completely healing it has shown a noticeable improvement. Some of these products have a horrible smell but this one is the opposite it doesn’t make you want you turn your head while applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it time and this product will show you a noticeable difference over a short period of time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this everyday for about a month and NOTHING.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a big problem, only 3 toes and have used many products to try to get rid of the fungus. They all helped keep it from spreading but did not get rid of it.  I used this for over 3 months.  The only result I got was my toenails turned white.  I quit using it and decided I would use the Vicks.  The Vicks keeps it from spreading and my nails look normal.  I had tried the Wal-Mart vapor rub without any success.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My wife tried this as an alternative to Penlac, which is a prescription antifungal topical nail medication. She said it cleared up a couple of toenails as effectively as Penlac, perhaps even faster. There is no noticeable odor. The dropper applicator is not as controllable as a brush applicator, but it does prevent contamination so that it is a benefit. The directions (a bit too sparse for me) recommend using a Q-Tip to apply the product.</li>
    <li> fixed small spot of nail.good!</li>
    <li> Arrived timely , got this for a relative she said she is using it and is hopeful it works</li>
    <li> It spread my toe nail fungus</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife.It was working at clearing the fungus pretty quickly,but she started getting a rash all around skin.She needed to stop using it</li>
    <li> I am testing this out.  One toe is being treated with this product and the other with tea tree oil.  As I see fit I will update this review.</li>
    <li> Seems like it&#x27;s working so far.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I can not say anything about this product, since I only now beginning to use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many things for fungal nails and this seems to be the best I have found .</li>
    <li> WOW! That is what I can say about this product.  I ordered it about 2 1/2 weeks ago, my nails were full of fungus, black and I was embarrassed to walk without socks on.  I am male. And I could not be happier. After applying once a day for the past 2 weeks, my nails are now almost fully white again and healthy looking!  I hardly ever give a review on any product, but this by far has got to be the best. I have had medications given over the counter and by a foot doctor, but not had worked.  This is the real deal, do not spend big bucks elsewhere.  Just stay on focus to apply daily, let dry about 15 to 20 minutes, will not completely dry, but just put socks over your feet and go on your daily business.  In a couple of weeks of doing this you will see the difference. I am 100% sold on this product. Will continue to purchase if I need it again, but the way its going I may not!</li>
    <li> Pleased so far, time will tell</li>
    <li> I have been using Probelle for about 5 days now and I&#x27;m already seeing significant improvements in my nails. I have been struggling with the color of my nails for years, constantly dealing with breakage and discolor. I have always had my nails painted to try to hide the yellow ness. Probelle is finally giving me some hope. So far in this short time it has only changed the color of my nail but I have high hopes that this is going to help improve the strength and thickness of my nail too based on how quickly it has helped my color! My nail is quickly turning back to its normal white color.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am using this product to fight toenail fungus and it has helped.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like how it made my toe nail get worse.  I read the reviews prior to purchasing this product, they were all good.  But my results didn&#x27;t compare, I stopped using it after 3 weeks because it made the fungus worse. 😞</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since the 11th and have not noticed any difference. The bottle is very small and hard to grip. It kept slipping until it finally fell this morning and spilled after I had just showered. The liquid is very slimy and hard to get off the floor, and skin and if you spill any on the bottle, forget about it.</li>
    <li> A little too early to tell, but will continue using and follow up.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this. It seemed to change the texture of the nail but I think that is only because it stays moist all the time. I have had a problem with it causing all the skin around my nails becoming soft (like when you get out of a long shower or bath) and it is peeling everywhere. Unsightly to say the least.  The nails have turned opaque. Not sure if this is an improvement or it is worse. Not happy.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t get toenail fungus overnight. You also don&#x27;t cure it with one treatment, whether it&#x27;s a prescription or an over the counter treatment. That is also true for Probelle All Natural Fungal Nail Treatment. That said this seems to work faster than any other over the counter treatment I have ever used. I like that this is all natural rather than a long list of chemicals that I have no idea what they are or if they are safe. Sometimes some people perceive &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as &amp;#34;ineffective&amp;#34;. Not the case &amp; this is not an inferior product. Quite the opposite as this is safe &amp; effective. The Best</li>
    <li> I have one toenail that is well a little funky, but have resisted treating it due to cost of laser treatment or side effects of prescription drugs. While this is an unexpected use of coconut oil, so far it seems to clear up the new nail gowth looks healthier.</li>
    <li> I have long been aware of the surprising health benefits of coconut oil, and yet little did I know that coconut oil is also great for fungal nail treatment. This product works as advertised. I got it for my in-law who had suffered from fungal infection in his toenails for a long time. He tried many types of treatment and most had been ineffective. Anyway, he has been applying this product twice daily and already seen a positive change after 2 weeks. We are all surprised that it&#x27;s so fast to see a change. A promising product and easy to use. Best of all, it&#x27;s all natural, using the anti-fungal property of coconut oil. My in-law finally got a product that works for him.</li>
    <li> I waited until the last day before submitting this review to try and give this treatment every chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it twice a day on a thumbnail that had developed nail fungus. I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles and I certainly didn&#x27;t get any. There may be a small improvement in the appearance of the nail, but the yucky stuff under the nail is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is there were no undesirable side effects. I expect to continue to use this as long as the bottle holds out and will update this review accordingly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had nail fungus for years and have battled it half-heartedly every so often. This time I decided that I will make more of an effort and really get rid of it by ensuring that I was faithful and aggressive using the products every day. I purchased several nail fungus treatments including a foot soak. I&#x27;d often see reviews how the toenails take six to eight months to grow out and never agreed with it. My toenails always grew quickly even when removing the brown hardened and brittle nails from the nail bed. It wasn&#x27;t unusual for it to grow back within a couple of weeks. I guess it grew quickly because of the fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a month between this product and another product that smells like oregano along with the foot soak. My nails have not grown back yet. My big toe bed on my right foot was always the worst and when clipping the brown nails, you could see that the toe bed was brown/black and the fungus was part of the skin. I was able to do this because most of the nail separated from the toe bed. Since most of my toenail on my right foot is gone I can see the results more quickly than the other toes. The brown/black used to run from the bottom to the top, but now it&#x27;s only at the bottom and I can see that the fungus goes really deep. I put a Band-Aid on to protect my exposed toe bed during the day after I allow the product to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe my nails haven&#x27;t grown back yet.I guess the fungus is being killed off and once that happens my nails will start to grow back. I&#x27;ll update again in six months.</li>
    <li> This item&lt;br /&gt;Is great and different from a lot&lt;br /&gt;Of the other brands I&#x27;ve had which smell super chemical like. This one is much more natural and seems to be less harmful for ur body. I love it!! And it cured my gray nails. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using this probelle fungal treatment for two months and was&lt;br /&gt;happy to find it on amazon as it is more convenient for me to buy it here.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased kerasal in the past and I have to say I can not only see&lt;br /&gt;better performance with Probelle Fungal Treatment but being that it is a&lt;br /&gt;Natural Product makes me feel even better when using it. It took a little&lt;br /&gt;over two weeks for me to see and FEEL! the difference. My nails are softer&lt;br /&gt;and feel thinner as well as the yellow coloring is starting to go away.&lt;br /&gt;The product is unscented and that is a plus! Like everything it is a&lt;br /&gt;process but I am really happy to have finally found a product that works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day for almost three weeks. I have a fungal infection on one of my big toes, which has been there for a long time. I had tried many products, all over the counter, (because after doing some research it looks as though the prescription products are ineffective, and the prescribed pills have really bad side effects). I have had zero success with anything I have tried in the past, which has been really frustrating. I started using the Probelle on all my toenails, twice a day, and saw definite improvement of my nail&#x27;s color almost right away. At the moment, my nail looks better than it has looked for almost two years, and I hope that the fungus will actually be gone by the time I finish the treatment, but I plan to keep using up the current bottle and buying an additional one, and will reevaluate where I am at that time. Probelle has no odor, is clear in color, and easy to use. I just put a couple of drops on each toe and let it dry. I have a small problem with the skin around my toenails having become flaky, like it is very dried out. It is not sore, and I don&#x27;t think it is an issue. I have started to use a moisturizer to help this. I am not enthusiastic about the bottle and dropper. The writing on the bottle is so small as to be illegible. Although I can find the information I need online, only minimal use instructions are on the bottle, and there is no insert with extended information. I would like to know how to tell if the fungus is gone, for instance; what products would be compatible for use with the Probelle, such as moisturizers and polishes, and what side effects people have experienced. Having said that, this is the only product I have used which shows rapid and significant improvement, and it looks like there will be light at the end of this  tunnel. I may even use the pool this summer, which I did not do last year at all because I was embarrassed. I will update this review as I have more extended experience with Probelle because I am thrilled to have found a product that works. Update: It worked for me! I started to use this product in the beginning of June, and it will be September tomorrow. I used up the product in the bottle, and my toe was looking pretty good. I decided to just let it be for a while, and also started going barefoot more than I ever had before. Now, three months later, my toe is looking very presentable, although the nail still has to grow in a bit more. There is no more discoloration, or thickening of my nail. I am very pleased, because it&#x27;s been a battle!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for less than 1 month, so can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s efficacy yet. The product description does say it may require more than one botle to achieve the desired resuts.&lt;br /&gt;I can see that there seems to be some improvement to my nail fungus problem. In addition, I can report that the product has no odors nor side effects to discourage use.</li>
    <li> ***60 DAY UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I have to report that other than the initial &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; effect have seen NO FURTHER IMPROVEMENT. I thought my new nail growth was coming in clear...I was mistaken.  I can NOT recommend  a purchase of this product. &amp;#60;----Update !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a long standing fungi nail battle going with my left big toe. I dropped a pallet on it many years ago. The nail fell off but when it grew back, it grew back with fungus. I have tried vinegar &amp;#60;---did not work and I tried Lamsil tablets&amp;#60;---needed to keep up with blood work so I stopped.I tried all of the OTC drug store products !  Nothing has worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nail is yellow, brittle and has dark stripe running through it! Yes its gross! I generally file it down as much as possible , glue on a fake toenail and call it a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with much trepidation I ordered the Probelle Fungal All Natural nail treatment. The product is clear and slightly thick. The included applicator is an eye dropper. I would MUCH prefer if it were a brush. The dropper is wasteful. The dropper actually pushes back up into the black squeeze portion. I can push it back down but it&#x27;s annoying. I apply it twice a day religiously! The bottle after 30 days is still more than half full so it&#x27;s a good value. It dries quickly and it does NOT sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been 30 days so I can&#x27;t say I am &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34;  The product started off like gang busters! It immediately lightened the color of the nail .The nail bed also looks cleaner. I see new growth at the nail line and it seem to growing in clear...It takes a long time to grow out a toenail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a product worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I will update my review at the 60 day mark ***</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK!!!.  What a scam like all of them.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. Takes a good 2 months to see results but its worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Really works. Started to see improvement with just a few applications.</li>
    <li> Works well. Slowly curing the fungus.</li>
    <li> It worked!  I had to file half my nail off and maybe that did it alone but who knows?</li>
    <li> Received it really quick.  I hope it works as well as everyone says.</li>
    <li> A very good product, but it does take a while to work so patience is necessary.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me at all. My nail fungus was getting better but within 2 days of using Probelle it flared up again. While coconut oil has anti-microbial properties it is rarely potent enough to treat nail fungus. Hopefully the product works better for other people. :-)</li>
    <li> I ordered this to try a more natural product on my toes I have had a toenail fungus for about a year and I have tried lots of products so this product has coconut oil and that&#x27;s a great anti fungal treatment but anyone that has a fungus knows it takes months to get rid of so I have only been using this for a few days but I can feel a difference that is less pain in my toenails as when I don&#x27;t use anything or forget to use for a few days they are sore , this product has a dropper on the top to squeeze exactly how much you want out at a time for easy use and less waste . so if you use this 3 times a day regularly it will help control and may cure your fungus .I got this at s discounted price to do a honest reveiw .</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, i suffer from toe nail fungus fungus... and since I only like to use organic products it has been impossible for me to find a natural treatment that actually worked!!&lt;br /&gt;But I am IMPRESSED with Probelle&#x27;s all natural fungal nail treatment... with only 2 applications daily the past 2 weeks the yellowish of my nail is already almost gone and there is no pain at all!&lt;br /&gt;Also, really liked that it is unscented! almost most of the treatments that I have tried until now, had a horrible smell to them!</li>
    <li> I previously tried another brand (Kerasal) for a long time with little to no results. I faithfully used Karasal for over a year hoping it would eventually work. Come to find out, Karasal wasn&#x27;t meant for killing the fungus, but for restoring the color when the fungus had already been treated. I researched like crazy and finally found Probelle. I was sold on the fact that Probelle&#x27;s was unscented and when I called the brand, I was told it was made to not only kill the fungus, but restore the color, soften nails, change the thickness, and keep the fungus away once cured. I was a bit skeptical, but I started to see a change in the first two weeks. By the third week, my nails looked bright white (compared to the yellow tinge they once were). By the fourth-fifth week there are promises of the thickness growing out, and I can already see a change in the feel of the nail (not as brittle and becoming softer - especially noticeable when trimming). Here are some tips for how I use it: I have been using this on all of my toenails, if not twice daily, at least once a day after showering. I apply it all over the base, tops, and under the nails. It is important to let it sit/dry for about 10 minutes before putting socks on, which I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s not sticky at all. The liquid dropper makes it a breeze to apply, and there is definitely no scent whatsoever. One thing I did learn about this treatment is that the coconut oil is an active ingredient killing off the fungus. So for the past week, I have also been applying the following extra virgin coconut oil ([[ASIN:B003OGKCDC Nature&#x27;s Way Extra Virgin Organic Coconut Oil, 32-Ounce]]) to the rest of my feet just before putting on my socks, ten minutes after applying this treatment. The coconut oil is making the normally rough skin on the bottom of my feet, super soft. It is also supposed to cure and/or ward off any athlete&#x27;s foot fungus if you happen to suffer from it. Just a tip. So overall, this treatment is so far, so good! One bottle will last me about a month and a half using it on all my toes, once to two times daily. I&#x27;m starting to love my feet again, and no longer have that feeling of helplessness that you get when you feel like you can no longer wear sandals and cute open-toed shoes. Hope this helps someone!! One bottle will last me about a month and a half using it on all my toes, once to two times daily.

    <li> Products does the job it describes. My tonail color and feeling has changed. It no longer bothers me and the color has cleared. I apply it all around the cuticle as well to really get the product all around the nail area</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mildly dry, flaking, discolored toenails - I&#x27;m not even sure I have nail fungus, but figured this stuff couldn&#x27;t hurt! It is indeed scentless, which is great, and has components derived from coconut, also a plus (and accurate as advertised). I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 days so it&#x27;s too early for me to tell if it&#x27;s going to be effective or not, but I gave it only 3 stars because in the short 48 hours since I have opened it, the entire bottle turned from a nice crystal clear to foggy, murky white. Weird, and kinda gross! I have been careful not to touch the tip of the applicator to ANYTHING, so there has been no chance of cross-contamination. Hoping it does not change the supposed effectiveness of the product.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
