      <li>I love the scent!  </li>
      <li>Really enjoying this purchase!</li>
      <li>This pack first off is a very good combo of scents, i was searching for years for the perfect array of choices in one pack, and this was the first i found.</li>
      <li>They work great with either tea light style diffusers, or with flame-less (like scentsy) which is what i use it with.</li>
      <li>The oils arrived on time and they came in a nice box.  </li>
      <li>Kinda pricey but nice fragrances...</li>
      <li>They also came in a nice box that you can keep them in.</li>
      <li>This particular scent pack is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t very strong and some of the scents were a bit off.  </li>
      <li>love, love, love these oils!</li>
      <li>And secondly, all of the smells are excellent, i particularly love the lavender, it is by far the best lavender scent i have had!</li>
      <li>This tim for myself:).</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>fast, and all varieties worked great in our oil lamp.  </li>
      <li>and I love them.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
      <li>is easy to store keeping the fragrances togather-  </li>
      <li>Works great with the ZAQ Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone searching for some nice relaxing scented oils.</li>
      <li>The Peppermint and Eucalyptus smelled good, but they weren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
      <li>Very nice scents for a relaxing working day.&lt;br /&gt;the oil&#x27;s scents are very nice and long lasting.</li>
      <li>I chose this based on reatings, but I guess I just have a difference preference in scents - will try to find something a bit more modern.</li>
      <li>Other than that these are ok, just make sure you check right away that you got the right scents.</li>
      <li>The smells are great and they last a long time so defiantly worth the money.</li>
      <li>but I think this oil will last me awhile....:)</li>
      <li>Love mixing the different oils to make new scents!</li>
      <li>I have purchassed oils in the past through various retail locations, and one other time online, but many of the smells are not quite right, or with the combo packs, some are great and some suck.</li>
      <li>The oils are very foul smelling.</li>
      <li>So much better than I ever expected.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing and long lasting!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I purchased 3 other scents individually and they are amazing.  </li>
      <li>I am  not sure why the individually better.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought they were from a different company but now see they are not.  </li>
      <li>The Frankincense smelled wonderful, but the Jasmine smelled bad and the Sandalwood didn&#x27;t really smell like Sandalwood, it was very flat.  </li>
      <li>If you want your house to smell like that of old people, this is for you.</li>
      <li>You are much much better off buying Glade candles and making your room smell pleasant than buying this disgusting product.</li>
      <li>The only oil I burned so far is the sandlewood.....</li>

<li> The only oil I burned so far is the sandlewood.....</li>
<li> Although I wasn&#x27;t familiar with all the scents, all the bottles all smelled the same, and it appeared that one of the bottles had leaked, so the box reeked with an unpleasant scent.  </li>
<li> Complete waste of money and huge disappointment! .</li>
<li> Warning: A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> So, you are going to get a little box with these oil scents - just what you see in the picture.  </li>
<li> so small.. not worth the price..</li>
<li> Amateur hour-</li>
<li> I received this pack and they hardly smell at all.  </li>
<li> The labels must have gotten mixed up at the manufacturer - Sandlewood is coco butter which I hate.</li>
<li> This was just her day maker-lots of  choices in one box &amp; just the touch of scents not to be  irritating to allergy prone noses -box</li>
<li> Disappointed in this item.</li>
<li> They smell like horrible chemicals and not at all like the flower or wood scents they are marketed as.</li>

    <li> This particular scent pack is wonderful.  Jasmine, eucalyptus, etc.  Works great with the ZAQ Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser! Good value!</li>
    <li> Disappointed in this item. Doesn&#x27;t hold smell. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> for a gift- I have a friend who is hospitalized- This was just her day maker-lots of  choices in one box &amp; just the touch of scents not to be  irritating to allergy prone noses -box is easy to store keeping the fragrances togather-  I will buy again- This tim for myself:). Recommend</li>
    <li> So, you are going to get a little box with these oil scents - just what you see in the picture.  They are very good.  We are still using them, so I can&#x27;t comment on each one - but what we have used are very good.  We use them in our fountain indoors to make the house smell great.  The work great.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought these oils to go with an oil warmer that I purchased and I was...underwhelmed.  They aren&#x27;t very strong and some of the scents were a bit off.  The Frankincense smelled wonderful, but the Jasmine smelled bad and the Sandalwood didn&#x27;t really smell like Sandalwood, it was very flat.  The Peppermint and Eucalyptus smelled good, but they weren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
    <li> so small.. not worth the price.. and when you try to pour it out it goes everywhere. wouldnt buy again</li>
    <li> Kinda pricey but nice fragrances...</li>
    <li> The oils are very foul smelling. They smell like horrible chemicals and not at all like the flower or wood scents they are marketed as. You are much much better off buying Glade candles and making your room smell pleasant than buying this disgusting product. Complete waste of money and huge disappointment! .</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance selections and the box is great!  I will determine whether I purchase again after I make my next batch of MP soap.</li>
    <li> Great price and product</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this purchase! The bottles are well designed to avoid dripping and leaking. Will repurchase once I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> Amateur hour- The labels must have gotten mixed up at the manufacturer - Sandlewood is coco butter which I hate. Other than that these are ok, just make sure you check right away that you got the right scents.</li>
    <li> The smells are great and they last a long time so defiantly worth the money.</li>
    <li> I did what I seldom do with products from Amazon: returned this product. Although I wasn&#x27;t familiar with all the scents, all the bottles all smelled the same, and it appeared that one of the bottles had leaked, so the box reeked with an unpleasant scent.  I literally kept it in the garage till I could return it.</li>
    <li> I have purchassed oils in the past through various retail locations, and one other time online, but many of the smells are not quite right, or with the combo packs, some are great and some suck. This pack first off is a very good combo of scents, i was searching for years for the perfect array of choices in one pack, and this was the first i found.

    <li> So much better than I ever expected. Definitely will be purchasing this again and again. Every scent is so wonderful and well equipped with great mixtures</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
    <li> Good product and good value.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The scents are are great! Warning: A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 other scents individually and they are amazing.  I received this pack and they hardly smell at all.  At first I thought they were from a different company but now see they are not.  I am  not sure why the individually better.  I am going to attempt to buy a couple of these individual and see if there is a difference.  The ones I purchased were Lemongrass/Ylang Ylang/Rose Garden and I love them.  Not one of these in the pack do I like.</li>
    <li> If you want your house to smell like that of old people, this is for you. I chose this based on reatings, but I guess I just have a difference preference in scents - will try to find something a bit more modern.</li>
    <li> love, love, love these oils!</li>
    <li> Love mixing the different oils to make new scents!</li>
