<li> How long does this take to work?</li>
<li> I just switched from the Bos-Revive to Bosley Defense duo and initially found that the shampoo (Defense) was less drying and left my  hair easier to manage.  </li>
<li> My hair was feeling so thin on the sides and my hairdresser really noticed a difference after I started using Bosley products and so am I!</li>
<li> I wrote a previous review on one of the other bosley products and I feel the same about this one</li>
<li> Bosley products have been a lifesaver for my embarrassing hair loss due to stress.</li>
<li> I only have one negative about ordering this product on line and it didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;The temperature here in MN</li>
<li> But what I have noticed is less hair breakage.</li>
<li> I would recommend it to anyone who has a little thinning of their hair or any type of itching on your scalp...  </li>
<li> It is no miracle and can be a little drying, but does help.</li>
<li> I have seen a few little a pieces at the scalp but not that noticeable.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday</li>
<li> If you try it, give it a few months.</li>
<li> Not sure if it works or not</li>
<li> I hardly have hair in my comb now.</li>
<li> My hair has always been slow to grow</li>
<li> Thin areas have all regrown hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m throwing these out after using them for approximately 6 weeks!</li>
<li> I was skeptical but have been using it for 2 years now</li>
<li> it make it very inconvenient to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Shampoo seems to give my aging hair more body.  Haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner yet but hope it does the same.</li>
    <li> I was recomended these products from my Salon. I actually bought the starter kit there, but on Amazon I found a much better price.  I am hoping the products will help my hair in the long run, so far, I like them.</li>
    <li> I bought these for the bigger bottles, so it will last a while.  I feel this has helped my hair feel thicker and stronger.</li>
    <li> best shampoo and conditioner for body, does not leave hair dry like some I have used</li>
    <li> Save your money!  These products left my scalp itchy all of the time and I experienced a lot more hair loss!  I&#x27;m throwing these out after using them for approximately 6 weeks!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner seem to help my hair stay thick and healthy... I would recommend it to anyone who has a little thinning of their hair or any type of itching on your scalp...  It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! Excellent packaging and shipped right on time. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I used it before and it helped my hair grow considerable. I recommend it to all my friends, don&#x27;t use every day tho, have another shampoo and alternate. I only use twice in a row.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a very timely manner..I love it!my hair os thick now and has been growing and not brealing off. I love it</li>
    <li> my hair definately is showing new growth. I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s not falling out as much and it feels thicker. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Good product but poor packaging and it leaked.</li>
    <li> I use this on several of my clients with thinning hair and it is wonderful . Their hair actually looks and feels thicker after about a month of use.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, but makes my hair dry and full of static.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!  It truly helps keep you from losing hair!  I have been very please and delighted with each of these.  The company delivers quickly and safely!</li>
    <li> Works every bit as well as the same sizes that were selling at my hair salon for $100 a bottle. I checked its ingredients and they are precisely the same. Bosley products have been a lifesaver for my embarrassing hair loss due to stress. My hair is back to normal after only 5 months. You must purchase the 3rd step which is the foam!!</li>
    <li> I just switched from the Bos-Revive to Bosley Defense duo and initially found that the shampoo (Defense) was less drying and left my  hair easier to manage.  Now after using it for a while, I have noticed that my has has filled in on my scalp where I had significant hair loss.  My dermatologist said the hair loss was genetic and that there was nothing I could do about it.  I believe her; however, I am seeing much thicker hair and much more hair on the top of my head, much to my surprise from a shampoo product.</li>
    <li> I wrote a previous review on one of the other bosley products and I feel the same about this one so I just did a copy and paste of  that review in each of the products I used.  I Don&#x27;t know if it was the combination of them or one worked better than another because I used one or the other every day.  Here is the original review:&lt;br /&gt; I am an afro-american woman, and noticed hair thinning on my crown for several months. I have tried several things to thicken my hair but nothing worked. I bought this product along with the conditioner, shampoo, hair regrowth treatment, and hair folicle energizer, I have only been using these for 4-6 weeks. My hair has always been slow to grow so I haven&#x27;t seen very much growth. But what I have noticed is less hair breakage. I hardly have hair in my comb now. For me, this is a plus, because before using these products my comb would be full of hair. Hopefully soon I will be able to see my thinning areas filling in.</li>
    <li> Before using this production we would on occasion see hair in the drain after showing, after using this product, the hair loss has reduced considerably. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I only have one negative about ordering this product on line and it didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;The temperature here in MN was brutal.&lt;br /&gt;The driver handed me the package and when I got inside and opened the product, they were frozen.&lt;br /&gt;When thawed they seemed fine.&lt;br /&gt;I am using them without any noticed problems</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my stylist. I was skeptical but have been using it for 2 years now and it has dramatically improved my hair. Thin areas have all regrown hair. It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as some shampoos and conditioners but I don&#x27;t care since it works. If you try it, give it a few months.</li>
    <li> My hair was feeling so thin on the sides and my hairdresser really noticed a difference after I started using Bosley products and so am I! I have so much new growth.</li>
    <li> How long does this take to work? I have been using both the shampoo and conditioner for two months going on three. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday so how long will it take to notice thickening hair and new growth? I have seen a few little a pieces at the scalp but not that noticeable. I want this to really work.</li>
    <li> The caps do not open on either bottles.  it make it very inconvenient to use. I was expecting no problems.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before with fairly good results. It is no miracle and can be a little drying, but does help.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these products.  Particularly, the conditioner.  It does not condition well and your hair feels like straw.  The shampoo is ok but has a strange smell to it. Not sure if it works or not but I did not see a remarkable improvement.</li>
