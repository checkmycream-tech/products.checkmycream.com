      <li>Love the product!</li>

      <li>Cinnamon is definitely my favorite!  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s really amazing stuff.  </li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll keep making my own.</li>
      <li>nice and cinnamon-y and earthy.</li>
      <li>After brushing it on, it kind of absorbs into your mouth.</li>
      <li>You can MAKE YOUR OWN stuff for pennies.</li>
      <li>The flavor doesn&#x27;t stick around which is nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been intending to make my own but haven&#x27;t gotten around to it, so I was eager try this.</li>
      <li>Impressed by the very clean/pure ingredient list, I decided to give EarthPaste a try.  </li>
      <li>While I love the smell of tea tree it does not taste good in my mouth.</li>
      <li>Tastes nice, does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Tastes good and cleans better.</li>
      <li>This is a great family friendly compromise.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect a lot of foam, but the taste is very good and leaves your mouth feeling very</li>
      <li>The flavor is good, and it makes my teeth feel clean.</li>
      <li>Tastes good (cinnamon) and my mouth feels clean</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few of their flavors, and I like Wintergreen the best, BUT this is still a great toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I bought this as part of making more healthy choices, but am loving it, too.  </li>
      <li>Tastes great - fresh breath &amp; NO STUPID CHEMICALS!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s great, however guests don&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not a bad thing, just surprising.  </li>
      <li>cinnamon taste is excellent, and you can even drink orange juice or coffee right after brushing without the horrid tasting combination normally experienced with regular toothpaste.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product was great and the shipping was prompt. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Tastes great and good for your teeth ingredients</li>
    <li> While this product is completely natural, I found the lack of foaming action to be something I couldn&#x27;t do without. The toothpaste completely dissolved in the mouth and I found myself brushing with whatever liquid was there. I&#x27;m going back to the Natural Dentist fluoride-free toothpaste, peppermint sage flavor.</li>
    <li> As far as ingredients go, these are top notch. And, my teeth feel very clean. My problem, with this (and most natural products) is taste. Not a bad taste, far from it, just not much flavor at all. I guess the manufacturers know you can&#x27;t call a clay based product &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; because of what you&#x27;d get when you add water . . . mud. And who wants to brush their teeth with mud? There is certainly a hint of cinnamon flavor when you start brushing, but it dissipates almost immediately after initial contact. In fact, if they were to triple or even quadruple the amount of cinnamon in the product it would still not be over-powering. If you are looking for a toothpaste with a flavor that is not over-powering, this is the ticket.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. I have tried several natural toothpastes. This is my favorite. Love the flavor and makes my teeth feel clean.</li>
    <li> I actually like the taste- nice and cinnamon-y and earthy. I like the taste better than the usual big brand names with foaming agents and fluoride. This is a nice addition to my new, completely natural tooth-care practices. Just a note: maybe don&#x27;t spit this into drains as it contains bentonite clay (will clay clog up your drainpipes? not sure).</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a while and really like it. I&#x27;m happy that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride, and I am comfortable letting my toddler use it, since she tends to swallow the toothpaste and I really don&#x27;t want her ingesting fluoride, SLS, or other chemicals. My teeth have stayed very clean, although they don&#x27;t get quite as white with this toothpaste as with some others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real gripe is that the threaded top is kind of a pain -- I&#x27;d love a flip-top tube!</li>
    <li> I like this product and it tastes great.  The issue I have with it is that it claims it whitens teeth but I do not see any of these effects.</li>
    <li> Love it! Tastes great - fresh breath &amp; NO STUPID CHEMICALS!</li>
    <li> I add dōTETTA On Guard (which I sell) to it to kick it up a notch.  My breath feels fresher when I add it.</li>
    <li> The ingredient list in this toothpaste has none of the bad stuff that many of the conventional products have, and it still does a great job.  Don&#x27;t expect a lot of foam, but the taste is very good and leaves your mouth feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;The SLS and who knows what other ingredients in other products gave me headaches, but I am having no problems at all with Earthpaste!</li>
    <li> Very good toothpaste,  will be staying with it and will not be going back to commercial brands.  Does not foam up in mouth. My mouth fills with saliva only.  I have the cinnamon flavored one. Tastes good and cleans better. With the xylitol it helps keep mouth clean of plaque longer. One thing that I found grows plaque fast is chocolate.  I also found a fluoride / xylitol rinse. With flossing the mouth is really clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also one thing I noticed. I also brush the back on my tongue. With the commercial toothpastes, heavy phlegm I would always spit out.  However with this toothpaste there is non of that. Just clear good saliva.</li>
    <li> Its not my favorite. I have tried Auromere - Ayurvedic Herbal Toothpaste, Tropical Traditions Teeth Cleaner, and Young Living Thieves Dentarome Ultra Toothpaste. I would say the top two are Tropical Traditions Teeth Cleaner(makes teeth feel great and clean), and Young Living Thieves Dentarome Ultra Toothpaste(always satisfied with Thieves products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is just ok. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I alternate toothpastes and am always looking for the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. Doesn&#x27;t taste bad like I think regular toothpaste tastes.</li>
    <li> All the the Earthpaste toothpastes are just great.  Since they are not smooth or slick like more &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpastes (that have all kinds of unneeded and probably unhealthy ingredients), they do the job and do it well.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is GREAT!!!  Tastes great, leaves your mouth clean and clean feeling (yes, they are different!), and is ECO friendly and NON-TOXIC for you!!!!  Win-win!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this toothpaste, and glad I&#x27;ve finally found a truly &amp;#34;All Natural&amp;#34; option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinnamon taste is excellent, and you can even drink orange juice or coffee right after brushing without the horrid tasting combination normally experienced with regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I usually make my own toothpaste in a glass jar with redmond clay, baking soda, calcium powder, coconut oil, and essential oils, but I wanted something a bit more convenient for when I traveled.  I love the ingredients in this toothpaste, and my teeth look nice after using it, but the taste definitely isn&#x27;t for everyone and my mouth doesn&#x27;t taste very fresh afterwards.</li>
    <li> Weird texture but my mouth feels clean after using it. It works really good to get a white coating off your tongue. After using it once the stuff is crumbling off. Gross I know. So that&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s just bizarre</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying natural toothpaste and although it was different than I expected, it works. It is not like a regular toothpaste texture, but  has more of a thin watery texture once you start brushing. This seems like a great product so far and I&#x27;m happy that it doesn&#x27;t have any glycerin or chemicals.</li>
    <li> Natural ingredients, not too sweet.  My teeth feel smooth and clean.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the other flavors.</li>
    <li> I conducted a 1-week experiment with EARTHPASTE and another toothpaste . . . After 1 week of using the well-known, name brand toothpate, my teeth looked like I hadn&#x27;t brushed them in 1 week :-(  I immediately went back to the EARTHPASTE!</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste. Makes my mouth a little tingly but doesn&#x27;t burn like regular store bought toothpastes. This also doesn&#x27;t foam like regular toothpastes because it lacks  SLS.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Mild enough and refreshing. Natural cinnamon and tea tree oils are good for gums. No complains.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with my first tube of Earthpaste: it&#x27;s very easy on the palate with just a subtle hint of cinnamon and a very pleasing consistency. And the price is right!! Usually the EWG SkinDeep.org approved toothpastes cost an arm and a leg!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using toxin-free toothpastes for a few years now, after discovering that my old standby, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, contained unsafe ingredients. I have tried a number of salty tooth powders which are good for \\&quot;remineralizing\\&quot; the teeth, but the super-salty taste is pretty hard to get past. I have also tried some other natural pastes, but none compares to Earthpaste: it stays on the toothbrush, the tube is efficient and functional (and not all tubes are! Miessence, for example, makes a tube that leaks toothpaste!), and LAST BUT NOT LEAST, MY TEETH FEEL AND LOOK CLEAN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pocketbook, my teeth and I are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This was definitely different from your regular toothpaste, but I was expecting this.  I wanted something more natural.  It takes some getting use to as it does not foam like I was use to.  I like the cinnamon taste.  I would purchase this again in the future.</li>
    <li> After studying the best homemade alternatives to standard toothpaste, and trying several recipes, I found this toothpaste and am very satisfied with it.  My favorite is the lemon twist version.  You might think -- eww, clay!? -- but it is very smoothly incorporated into the toothpaste.  SIde-by-side with a tube of conventional toothpaste, this is clearly a more healthy alternative and of substantial consistency.  Leaves no aftertaste.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is supposed be very healthy for you, and it certainly fits the motto if it&#x27;s healthy for you it tastes awful!  While one can taste the clay (which didn&#x27;t bother me), it leaves a slimy film in your mouth and it tastes heavily of tea tree instead of cinnamon.  I love herbal toothpastes but this is one I&#x27;ll not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely nasty!  How anyone can use this more than twice is beyond me.  And the clay taste stays with you for hours!</li>
    <li> Great cinnamon flavor&lt;br /&gt;no dyes&lt;br /&gt;natural&lt;br /&gt;simple&lt;br /&gt;The only toothpaste I like more than this is the lemon Earthpaste. Try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely bewildered on how people can taste clay or dirt in this toothpaste..  I&#x27;ve tasted nothing but clean realistic flavors.  The &#x27;fresh&#x27;  flavor doesn&#x27;t last very long afterwards but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a completely natural product..  People who are complaining about lack of flavor or how their mouth doesn&#x27;t feel fresh for hours and hours simply weren&#x27;t accustomed to the idea of 100% natural.</li>
    <li> GREAT TASTE THE TOOTHPASTE IS A LITTLE THIN BUT DOES THE JOB FOR A ALL NATURAL TOOTHPASTE</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I accidentally discovered Earthpaste.  Had been using Biotene toothpaste for years because it had no foaming agents in it.  I buy a new tube recently and guess what?  SOAP!  Phoned Biotene and they have added a foaming agent to ALL their toothpastes.  Searching the net for make-it-yourself toothpastes, someone mentioned Earthpaste.  Found it on Amazon and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Bought the cinnamon flavour and though I think it tastes more like cloves than cinnamon, it&#x27;s great.  Looking forward to buying this for years to come.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste! takes some getting used to as it doesn&#x27;t foam, but it leaves your mouth so fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> Love the cinnamon taste, and am impressed with how clean my teeth feel afterwards!  A big improvement over other toothpastes, both the regular &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; kind and the other healthy organic ones, too!  I bought this as part of making more healthy choices, but am loving it, too.  I&#x27;m going to try the other flavors as well!</li>
    <li> I have dental problems mostly due to medications I used to have to take for a seizure disorder. I no longer have seizures after 25 years, but I do suffer from the side effects of the medications. My teeth and gums took the biggest hit. I stopped using regular toothpaste about a year ago and started using this Earthpaste. My teeth are no longer sensitive and I don&#x27;t have dental pain like I used to suffer with at least 10 days out of every month. My teeth feel like they have just been cleaned after using this toothpaste. The cinnamon flavor is just right for me.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this toothpaste! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I thought it might taste like clay or something, but it doesn&#x27;t. Just a slight cinnamon taste, which I like. And I don&#x27;t mind it not foaming. It doesn&#x27;t foam because it&#x27;s all natural, which is fine with me. Now, I&#x27;ve gotten to where I don&#x27;t even want to use regular toothpaste anymore and only want to use this. It also makes my teeth feel dentist clean, even more so than drugstore toothpaste, which is another plus!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste takes a little getting used to after a lifetime of conventional toothpaste, but its not bad!</li>
    <li> My teeth feel like I just got a polish at the dentist&#x27;s office. It has a nice mild cinnamon taste.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was excited to find a toothpaste that would promote a healthier mouth; the cinnamon flavor (my favorite) and the tea tree oil convinced me to try it. I am SO glad I did!! Once I got over the initial distaste at the brown color of it (isn&#x27;t it funny how TV commercials have made white toothpaste seem the norm?), the taste blew me away. Then as I brushed, I noticed that it didn&#x27;t foam up in my mouth--which I have always hated--but it cleaned really really well. My mouth felt fresh for hours after I brushed. I am back to order a different flavor for my son, and I will continue to buy this great toothpaste. It came quickly, too, which is always a plus in my book. :)  I will not go back to the other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Forget about the conventional toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using this one for 6 months. The tooth sensitivity is gone. Before that I used Sensodyne and it did help but the sensitivity would reappear every time I forgot to brush or during my traveling if I forgot my Sensodyne tube and used another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beside that, now my teeth and gums look and feel cleaner and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is strange at first and takes a couple of days to get used to. It doesn&#x27;t foam (which is apparently a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;But now I only use Earthpaste and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve switched.</li>
    <li> The reason that I purchased this toothpaste was to try and rebuild the enamel on my teeth. My two front teeth have small translucent areas near the bottom. Ive used this toothpaste daily for 2months and i havent noticed any changes. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my husband who has really bad teeth (yellow, sensitive and bleeding gums) has noticed a diffrence. His teeth are less yellow and his gums are less sensitive. They do look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is not bad. I dont love it, but I dont mind it. After brushing it on, it kind of absorbs into your mouth. I find that I dont even have to rinse my mouth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my teeth feeling really smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed it has a weird warning on it about lead poisoning,  but ive noticed this warning on all things that contain bentonite clay. Supposedly,  they are required by law to put that warning on but the product has such a &amp;#34;minimal&amp;#34; amount that it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference... I was told that some vegetables have a higher lead count.. I dont know how true that is though...&lt;br /&gt;I figured it was ok because I read other reviews mentioning this very thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said...&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as an alternative to the usual flouride toothpastes, but not if you are trying to rebuild enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also took calcium and magnesium supplements to &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; with the enamel building and nothin...</li>
    <li> Flavor is ok but you have to force so much out to get it to feel like it is doing anything on your teeth, I am not in favor of this brand.</li>
    <li> Giving 1 star because the trace amounts of lead warning I saw on the box AFTER I purchased it. That is not listed anywhere online in the description if the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I prefer not to use mint toothpaste at night, and I was looking for a glycerine-free replacement for my old toothpaste. Obviously, if you&#x27;re used to industrial-strength toothpaste, this is a different kind of clean feeling: it will not leave your teeth feeling gritty and mentholated. What it will do, is set up your oral environment to stay healthy and plaque- free while you sleep. Before, I used to go to bed with freshly brushed teeth, and wake up with plaque in the morning. Now, my teeth are still clean when I wake up. Even though it doesn&#x27;t foam up, and feels almost too gentle to be doing anything when your brushing, it does work.</li>
    <li> wierd bland taste, though the paste cleans teeth pretty well.  Cinnamon not best flavor, this flavor very gflat for cinnamon, muddy.  Teeth clean and smmoth though, so other flaovrs chosen</li>
    <li> My only complaint with this toothpaste is that Redmond uses cinnamon LEAF oil instead of cinnamon bark oil, but they never label it as such on any of the material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is that cinnamon leaf oil (whether Ceylon or Cassia) smells and tastes strongly like clove, whereas cinnamon bark oil smells and tastes like... well... cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting a tube of toothpaste labelled &amp;#34;Cinnamon,&amp;#34; only to open it and smell the leaf oil is very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamon oil should always be labelled clearly (i.e., whether it&#x27;s cinnamomum zeylanicum/verum or cinnamomum cassia, and whether it&#x27;s leaf or bark) so that the customer knows exactly what he or she is getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t misunderstand me; I do love this product and I will buy it again. I would prefer, though, cinnamon bark oil over cinnamon leaf oil. But, at the very least, I would settle for transparency in labelling.</li>
    <li> Its not the nicest looking toothpaste in the world, and tends to get all over the sink, but I really like this brand.  Does a great job at cleaning your teeth and refreshes for breath.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been intending to make my own but haven&#x27;t gotten around to it, so I was eager try this. I was wondering if it would feel weird but to me, it just feels like toothpaste. The flavor is really good. I&#x27;m very happy with it and will probably buy it when I finish up this tube. (The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t buy again would be that I&#x27;m making my own)</li>
    <li> Love the flavor and the fact that it is really natural.  No flouride, no junk.  Hardest part was learning not to spit out my toothpaste when done brushing.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that the ingredients in this toothpaste are all edible.  That just seems right.  My gums feel less irritated since I switched to this from regular chemical filled commercial brand.  I also like that it makes good use of essential oils that are good for oral health.  I gave it 4 stars as I have only been using it a month and havn&#x27;t been able to tell yet the long term benefits, but so far I have noticed nothing negative.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have had two dentist appointments since swithching to this toothpaste and my teeth and gums are in better shape. I upped the stars to 5.  My children don&#x27;t like the flavor, so I bought lemon for them.  It tastes wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few of their flavors, and I like Wintergreen the best, BUT this is still a great toothpaste. I like how the Cinnamon doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering burn or linger like most other brands. Would recommend any of their products anyway, so this one goes without saying.</li>
    <li> Finally, a toothpaste that contains no chemicals or any harmful ingredients, feels and tastes great, and cleans teeth amazingly well. Someone just asked me the other day what I did that makes my teeth so white! Thanks, Earthpaste!</li>
    <li> It does get watery after a while and gets a little difficult to brush your teeth with, but it works as regular toothpaste. Cleans just as well. Flavour is NOT strong and does NOT last, but it does taste good.&lt;br /&gt;MIGHT stain teeth, but it&#x27;s not that noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and you can drink orange juice after you brush with this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the flavors.  Cinnamon is definitely my favorite!  Love that I&#x27;m using something natural to clean my teeth with instead of crest or colgate that are full of potentially toxic chemicals.  Made the switch about a year ago and am so happy I did!</li>
    <li> I like the taste, and how my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste is not an exciting thing, but I really like this one.  Its fluoride free, toxin free.  It tastes good.  A nice light cinnamon flavor.  It doesn&#x27;t foam, and it looks like mud coming out of the tube.  It IS clay based, and will leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean, but without that chemical burn of potent mint.  It took me a few days to get used to it, but now I am hooked.  I picked this up originally because my littles were having trouble with the spitting versus swallowing of toothpaste.  They have outgrown the kids fruity bubblegum flavors, but are&#x27;t ready for the minty burn of grown up toothpaste.  This is a great family friendly compromise.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the product!</li>
    <li> If you dislike the manufactured taste &amp; chemicals in commercial toothpaste,  this is wonderful!  The ingredient list reads like you hope it would.</li>
    <li> Works great. Tastes great.</li>
    <li> Our family LOVES this toothpaste. I actually like the fact that this doesnt foam. It leaves my mouth feeling wonderful! It has a great texture to it and an excellent taste. The kids like it and the adults like it. Win all around.</li>
    <li> Very different than anything else I&#x27;ve used but tastes pleasant and does not have the chemicals I want to avoid.  It is just what it says it is and does make your mouth feel fresh.</li>
    <li> Listen, this stuff IS great. But it&#x27;s madly overpriced. You can MAKE YOUR OWN stuff for pennies. Get some baking soda, bentonite clay, zeolite and you are rearing to go...</li>
    <li> Great product. I have already re-ordered this.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural toothpaste that had a cinnamon taste. My friend found this one while shopping and I was glad to find it on Amazon when I ran out. Although this paste does not suds up (which is what most people are familiar with) it gets the job done and makes my teeth feel more clean than even with the regular paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a natural toothpaste I would highly recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> I guess I should have read the ingredients a little better as this contains tea tree oil. While I love the smell of tea tree it does not taste good in my mouth. Disappointed as I love the rest of the redmond line of salts etc.</li>
    <li> I love Earthpaste. My daughter loves the lemon. It takes a bit to get used to the cinnamon and I might try the mint flavors next for a little bit fresher taste. I&#x27;ve been using essential oils for about a year and this was a good switch. The oils cure my sensitivity so much better than Sensodyne ever could! And with no chemicals or toxic fluoride!</li>
    <li> After searching for a healthy toothpaste for our 2 year old, I ordered this to try. I also brushed with it myself to try it out. It tastes really clean and leaves your teeth feeling very clean. Our toddler likes the taste which encourages him to brush. I recommend this as a good alternative to the commercial brand toothpastes on the market.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried that&#x27;s an alternative to chemical toothpastes. Safe enough you can eat it, they say!</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s definitely not like the toothpaste I was used to, but it does leave my mouth feeling clean with just a hint of cinnamon.  It doesn&#x27;t foam and that&#x27;s going to be an adjustment, but overall I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Tastes great and leaves teeth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Tastes nice, does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest making your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a plain toothpaste which cleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers everyone!</li>
    <li> After using for  awhile teeth turn yellowish , and it taste a bit funny and without the feeling of clean tooth . I wouldn&#x27;t buy a gain . I used the rest as an acne cream or skin mask  and it worked pretty well though .</li>
    <li> Different from regular toothpaste, yet it does the job.  Cinnamon taste is a plus.  This is a good alternative to commercial peppermint toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Great ingredients. I was really looking forward to this toothpaste.  Unfortunately it has zero foaming ability (which I knew it would be that way) but I was hoping I would like it anyway.  Tastes good (cinnamon) and my mouth feels clean but I don&#x27;t think I can get used to it. It seems to take twice as much as foaming pastes. This IS a good product, just not for me. I give it four stars for the quality (and fast shipping) but as far as personal preference, maybe two.</li>
    <li> Not into the cinnamon flavor... it reminds me of the Christmas Tree Store in the worst way possible. I find I have to use A LOT of this expensive toothpaste for it to get all the grime off my teeth. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I bought the Cinnamon flavor and it is awesome. It may take a little time to adjust if you are used to using conventional toothpaste. It is brown and there is no foaming. My teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I use it in conjunction with coconut oil, and my teeth are fantastic! I&#x27;ve done a little experiment, and in May I quit brushing with conventional toothpaste. In June, I had my semi-annual cleaning at the dentist. No cavities at that point, so I continued with the same earthpaste/coconut oil routine, and had my second cleaning here a few weeks ago. I&#x27;ve told plenty of people that I don&#x27;t brush with toothpaste, and they were all betting that I would have a cavity. Again, no cavities to speak of. Definitely recommend this product, however it is hard to convince people that brushing their teeth with clay is better than with fluoridated toothpaste!</li>
    <li> This is my new toothpaste of choice for our family :) Thank you for improving our tooth health and for containing all natural ingredients!!!</li>
    <li> I was getting canker sores constantly when using regular toothpaste. After I started using Earthpaste, I&#x27;ve been canker sore free. This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t contain whatever ingredient was irritating my mouth. The taste and texture take a little time to get used to though.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The flavor is good, and it makes my teeth feel clean. I use a flouride toothpaste once a day as well, but since I try to brush after each time I eat, I like to have this gentler paste to use most of the time.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste around!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works fine.  I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t foam.  That&#x27;s not a bad thing, just surprising.  The taste took a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s fine as well.  Overall this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Takes time to get used to it, because it doesn&#x27;t contain all those chemicals and foaming agents.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans very well, and also gets rid of bad breath.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, it is completely natural and gets my teeth nice and white. Once i started using this product, my mouth not only feels great, but also it looks much healthier. My teeth look great and my gums witch were residing are now coming to look healthy and normal. Great toothpaste, thank you so much for making this so important product. DO NOT USE REGULAR TOOTHPASTE, THE FLUORIDE IN IT, IT&#x27;S KILLING YOUR TEETH, AND MAKING MONEY FOR THE DENTIST AND MAKING YOU POORER.</li>
    <li> I have been trying different natural toothpastes and really like this one. It doesnt have the same texture or grit as regular toothpaste and its thin while brushing like many natural versions are. I don&#x27;t know why I assumed there would be more body just because it had clay as a base. It doesnt matter because my teeth feel much cleaner after I brush with this than they do when I use other natural toothpasts.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste came with tea tree oil.  I can not use this oil when taking homeopathy. The ingredient list did not disclosed the tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> It tastes pretty good. I don&#x27;t like that it is difficult to squeeze out of the tube and so a lot of times it goes &amp;#34;flying&amp;#34; over the toothbrush and into the sink. I&#x27;ve managed to come up with a tactic to avoid that most of the time now, but should I have to? I guess I&#x27;m also not used to the texture of this toothpaste. It just doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling clean. It seems kinda watery and doesn&#x27;t hold up long enough to brush my teeth completely before it starts breaking down. Maybe I need to use way more of it. The tube is designed to release the toothpaste in a much smaller stream than most other toothpastes, which made me think I wasn&#x27;t supposed to use much of it? Not sure. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see what kind of dental health results I might get from it. I do like that it is pretty simple in regards to ingredients and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of junk in it. Although it does have xylitol which I&#x27;ve heard mixed reviews on... it supposedly can strengthen teeth, but large amounts can cause seizures and if a pet gets ahold of it, it can kill them. So keep out of reach of Fido!</li>
    <li> I like the idea and the toothpaste in general. However the cinnamon is rather bland as far as taste goes..</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I love the fact that it&#x27;s truly all natural and doesn&#x27;t coat your teeth or contain fluoride. But I have noticed such a difference in my kids teeth and my own since using this product...they&#x27;re whiter!! My teeth feel clean afterward and you easily get used to the taste and lack of bubbles. I recommend the wintergreen flavor if you are switching from traditional toothpaste. It was the closest flavor to the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; taste of toothpaste that everyone would be used to. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> I had been searching for more natural toothpastes and ran into a website that recommended Earthpaste.  It makes my teeth so slick and clean and my gums are starting to look more pink, more healthy.  I also have no more bleeding when flossing.  I purchased another flavor.  Cinnamon is my favorite so far, but the Wintergreen is good too.  I want to try a few more of their flavors later.</li>
    <li> It definitely tastes better than it smells. I have tried this one and the Wintergreen flavor. I prefer Wintergreen, but Cinnamon isn&#x27;t bad. This is the first natural toothpaste I have tried and I have repurchased it because it does my teeth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> An FYI, the cinnamon tastes more like clove than cinnamon. But I still like it!</li>
    <li> Definitely different than commercial toothpastes, but my teeth feel clean! Big fan of the cinnamon flavor too! My husband was a skeptic but even he seems to like it!</li>
    <li> Tastes like dirt off the ground.</li>
    <li> Fast shipper, great product</li>
    <li> So happy to have found an all-natural toothpaste without fluoride and glycerin!  Lemon is our favorite flavor so far, but cinnamon is also very pleasant.  My teeth look whiter and feel stronger.</li>
    <li> Two things tempted me to buy this toothpaste. I actually don&#x27;t like the extreme foaming that comes with regular toothpaste. I know it&#x27;s not integral to cleaning your teeth, so it aggravates me that they always make toothpaste foam. The other was the reviews of people saying their teeth felt cleaner. Even after brushing my teeth I would feel like they weren&#x27;t clean, but what can you do about it? I would brush, floss, mouthwash and use a pick and still not feel clean. I also like that it does not have unneeded additives.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this toothpaste for a week straight. My teeth do feel cleaner, more polished. I have sensitive teeth and gums, and have not experienced any irritation from the toothpaste, nor increased sensitivity (I was using sensitive teeth toothpaste before). The paste is smooth and not gritty. The cinnamon flavor is mild.&lt;br /&gt;Probably the only downside is the price is about double regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> When will &amp;#34;Amazingly Natural&amp;#34; mean just that.&lt;br /&gt;This contains Xylitol. So not natural. Actually found to be carcinogenic. Swallow that? no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for my pregnant Fiance&#x27;. Upon arrival, the box states at the bottom that it contains lead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, 2 dings for me. Lead and Xylitol. Makes me want to gobble it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it until it&#x27;s empty as it seems to be a better solution than Coral White(contains Xylitol and Sorbitol) and better than Flouride-Free TOm&#x27;s(Contains Glycerin,SLS). But then I am moving on to OralWellness.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if its the cinnamon flavoring or what, but no sold on this stuff. Trying to be healthier but I miss the foaming!</li>
    <li> After making the switch to healthier (read: more natural) cosmetic products, I decided my mouth needed a cool change too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this at the grocery on sale for $5 and decided to give it a try. I feel it is expensive, for only 4 ounces, and would appreciate if the company would send out coupons. That being said, it truly is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth and this has reduced my sensitivity. It is odd looking, but the scent is great without being overpowering, and I honestly can say that this is the cleanest my teeth have ever been. My teeth stay clean for hours, and I can&#x27;t help but run my tongue over my teeth :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product, just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive. I look forward to trying the other flavors.</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth feel really clean and I love that it really is all natural ingredients! Now I have to try the wintergreen flavor.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was recommended by a friend, and I like it after the first use.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up like other toothpastes so that takes a little getting used to, but I definitely like that it does not contain fluoride or other harmful chemicals--all natural. My teeth feel extremely clean--like I just left the dentists office from a professional cleaning. Great cinnamon/annisette flavor!  Will not use any other toothpaste from now on!  Just wish the shipping would&#x27;ve been a little faster--I think it took approx. 1 week when usually my items arrive within 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> On tube #2.  Takes a bit of getting use to if you&#x27;ve been using mainstream toothpaste, but my teeth have never felt cleaner.  I hated the mint flavor of toothpaste and the mainstream ones always made me gag....this is so much better.  I do find that flossing and a tongue scraper are essential with this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This product takes getting used to, it does not foam up and it seems as if you are not doing a thorough job.  But honestly, it works great!  My dental cleaning was as perfect as any other time with my &amp;#34;non-natural&amp;#34; toothpastes.  I prefer the Wintergreen flavor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m conscientious about what I eat and what products I use in my home. I&#x27;ve tried a number of &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; tooth products and this is the one for me. My teeth feel clean and stay feeling clean, pleasing flavour too! The tube isn&#x27;t ideal and there&#x27;s some settling/separation that probably can&#x27;t be avoided without additives. I&#x27;m happy to forgo the additives.</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if I was allergic to regular toothpaste as my lips are always chapped.  (I&#x27;m not).  BUT I will say this toothpaste made my teeth feel the absolute smoothest they ever have! (Just like the day you go home from a dental cleaning!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the flavor, I love the way it makes my teeth feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if you&#x27;re ever in a hurry and spit in the sink and don&#x27;t make sure you wash it all down you have to put a little scrub into it to clean it out of the sink.  Nothing strenuous, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to just &amp;#34;dissolve and go down&amp;#34; like regular toothpaste once it has dried.  I&#x27;m talking a few seconds with your fingers, not major work.  But enough that I did notice it.</li>
    <li> This is a very natural product both in appearance, texture and flavor. It is not overpowering in taste but has a pleasant cinnamon flavor. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and mouth feeling fresh. I have been using baking soda for about a year now and the flavor of this product is much better. I do not like traditional famous brand toothpastes such as Crest or Colgate as the after taste is too fake and heavy. If you like Tom&#x27;s but have wanted something milder in flavor or even refreshing but not overpowering, give this a try. It&#x27;s pricier than I&#x27;d like but an excellent product.  I prefer this over Tom&#x27;s for flavor and mouth feel both during and after use.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are just what I was looking for especially no carrageenan however the taste is tolerable but just ok . I will probably try another brand when this runs out.</li>
    <li> Not this flavor. Barf. I&#x27;m sorry I really wanted to like this flavor because I love cinnamon flavored things but not this. My husband and I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and threw it away. Get the mint flavor, it&#x27;s much better.</li>
    <li> Good product but could be better. It does have trace amounts of lead it in like anything clay like. But it look up the ingredients and learn about them!</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this after learning about how natural it is. The taste is slightly different from any other toothpaste I have used before. It does not foam so it does take some time to get used to. Due to its consistency, it is best to wet your toothbrush before applying the paste instead of after to avoid washing it away.</li>
    <li> Great formula, all natural and simple, real cinnamon so it actually tastes like real earthy cinnamon. The flavor doesn&#x27;t stick around which is nice. You can enjoy food or drinks after cleaning your mouth without changing the flavor. I prefer the Lemon variety of this better, so I switch back and forth, but as the cold weather has approached it&#x27;s nice to taste cinnamon.</li>
    <li> All natural, short list of ingredients, flavored w/ essential oils, entirely edible and food safe, but in fact has health benefits to ingesting, *can* re-mineralize your teeth, naturally whitening, not abrasive, perfect for camping because you don&#x27;t have to rinse.  It&#x27;s really amazing stuff.  The peppermint is too spicy for our toddlers, but the fact that it is food safe makes it ideal for young brushers, and the Wintergreen works perfectly.  If you are more adventurous, after trying and liking this, you can buy Redmond clay in powder form and add your filtered water and essential oils, and use the clay for a multitude of other uses.  It&#x27;s really amazing stuff.  I am tempted to buy the 6 lb bucket.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is a godsend. Now only does it work better than any other natural tooth paste I&#x27;ve found, it isn&#x27;t full of glycerin and xanthan gum like most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes. No filler ingredients. Just the stuff that works.</li>
    <li> I like the taste and the health benefits.  It&#x27;s just not very thick like some other healthy toothpastes.  It&#x27;s very thin.</li>
    <li> If you are or want to be in the organic path... I recommend you buy this toothpaste... but, warn you... it is not white because is clay... it has no foamy agents... it&#x27;s completely natural... just earth ingredients...</li>
    <li> Pricey &amp; you have to use more of it than regular toothpastes.  But I believe it&#x27;s well worth it for the lack of harmful ingredients that are present in most other toothpastes (even other natural toothpastes) that your mouth is absorbing straight into your bloodstream.  Cleans teeth really well.  Makes my life simpler because I can purchase one tooth paste brand for my husband, my 4 year old son &amp; myself &amp; feel confident that it&#x27;s helping keep all our teeth and gums safe &amp; healthy.</li>
    <li> I might be biased - I&#x27;m a fan of the foaming part of toothpaste, and this just didn&#x27;t cut it for me due to its lack of full mouth coverage. It felt like putting clay on my teeth (which might be the point of how it cleans - I&#x27;m not sure!) I think I&#x27;ve used normal toothpaste too long to change. However, the flavor was great!</li>
    <li> NO where in the description did it state that it has LEAD in it. AFTER opening it says pregnant women and children should not use this product.  That scared the hell out of me.  I&#x27;m not using this toothpaste anymore as I know that lead is toxic.</li>
    <li> I love not having a mouth full of foam when I brush my teeth, and knowing that I&#x27;m not putting any synthetic chemicals into my mouth. Earthpaste for life!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve hated those foamy, mint-flavored toothpastes since I was a little girl (more decades ago than I care to mention). I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; toothpastes over the years, but never found one I really liked. Until now. This stuff is fabulous. No foaming, no unpronounceable chem-lab ingredients and -- best of all -- no nasty mint flavoring. Just salt, fine earth of some sort, a bit of cinnamon oil and just enough water to form a cooperative paste. Absolutely perfect. Next time I&#x27;ll order the three-pack.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m grateful for such a simple, natural, and healthy toothpaste, this stuff is a bit expensive.  It&#x27;s only 4 ounces of toothpaste.  I think I may start making my own!</li>
    <li> I am not quite sure how I feel about this toothpaste. I guess I have some time to get use to it. I wish the cinnamon was stronger! But hey, I rather keep this up than put fluoride in my mouth : )</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered this that I would like it but, wow.  I don&#x27;t like mint and the cinnamon in this is just right.  It isn&#x27;t gritty or weird feeling.  I am very satisfied with it and will reorder when I get close to the end of this tube.</li>
    <li> We LOVE Earthpaste.  It makes your teeth feel like you&#x27;ve just had a dental cleaning with regular use.  I LOVE the cinnamon flavor!</li>
    <li> Right on the back of the packaging it tells you it contains lead. Yes, I know lead can be naturally occurring but I still don&#x27;t want it in my body. Also, the description given by the company paints an image like it is good for the whole family, but the State of CA, right underneath the company&#x27;s description, warns you that it may not be appropriate for pregnant and nursing women, as well as children.</li>
    <li> Nice flavor, teeth feel clean.  I suppose I will know more about actual effectiveness at my next 6 month checkup!</li>
    <li> great taste. great value.  better for you.  better for your wallet!  Really like the cinnamon taste.  tastes real -- not artificial or off.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste bad and no added chemicals! Love this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> In theory, this toothpaste is great.  It&#x27;s all natural, it&#x27;s cinnamon flavored, it&#x27;s environmentally friendly and it&#x27;s locally produced (I live in Idaho).  I&#x27;m no stranger to natural toothpastes (I love Weleda&#x27;s Sea Salt toothpaste) and usually I love them so I was absolutely shocked at how terrible this toothpaste is.  For one thing, it&#x27;s got a weird, oily texture so it&#x27;s actually hard to keep it on the toothbrush and apply it to teeth.  Often the paste would fall off the toothbrush before I&#x27;d even managed to put it in my mouth so I went through a tube a lot faster than I normally do.  After about a couple of weeks of using this toothpaste, my teeth got progressively darker and darker, more and more stained looking.  My acupuncturist noticed and asked if I&#x27;d suddenly started drinking lots of coffee and tea (I hadn&#x27;t).  I actually did a month long tooth whitening kit (sort of counterproductive, if you&#x27;re trying to use more natural toothcare products) and still it didn&#x27;t really have any impact on the dark stains on my teeth (but it did make my teeth very sensitive to heat and cold).  Then I stopped using this toothpaste.  Literally within a day of switching from this toothpaste to a conventional toothpaste, the dark stains were gone.  If you&#x27;re looking for a natural, eco-friendly toothpaste, I recommend Weleda&#x27;s Sea Salt toothpaste.  It doesn&#x27;t taste great but it really gets your teeth clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste because I was interested to see if a more natural toothpaste would improve my dental health. Also, I am allergic to mint and though I can use regular toothpaste, it&#x27;s not exactly pleasant to have my mouth feeling a little numb for about an hour after I finish brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste works very well. I noticed an immediately improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, which was unexpected. Being used to a foaming toothpaste, it took a while to get used to the lack of \\&quot;bubbles\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t feel that this takes away from the experience. My mouth certainly feels cleaner and I think it&#x27;s less harsh on my gums as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: I dislike that there is no fluoride in this toothpaste, so I use it in conjunction with regular crest toothpaste. That is a personal preference. This toothpaste cleans my teeth very well on its own, and I will continue to purchase and use this toothpaste on a regular basis. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> tastes better than I expected, teeth feel clean.  too soon to know more.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this toothpaste. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. It does however take some time to get use to the flavor but overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Even tho it has a pleasant cinnamon taste, it&#x27;s hard to get used to a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t foam.  Kinda feels like you&#x27;re just pushing baking soda around in your mouth and there is no minty fresh feeling when you&#x27;re done.  I&#x27;ll definately use this up but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll re-rder.......</li>
    <li> We got this for our 3 year old because we didn&#x27;t want her teeth to rot from decay or her brain from the fluoride.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for in a natural toothpaste. Great cleaning. Reduced sensitivity. Not super whitening but lacking chemicals which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> While I LOVE the ingredient list....oh so safe and chemical free......I don&#x27;t like the way my teeth felt after brushing.  They felt kind of dirty, not smooth and polished :(  Boo....I guess I&#x27;ll keep making my own.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different brands of natural toothpastes now, but I think this might be the one that I will stick with for a while. I have wanted to make my own toothpaste, but it is pretty expensive to buy high-quality ingredients, so I have been searching for a toothpaste that is up to my high standards, and I think this might be it (at least for the moment, knowing me *LOL*). The last toothpaste that I was using was PerioBrite, but I just wasn&#x27;t able to convince myself that vegetable glycerin (which coats the teeth) was okay to leave in my mouth for an extended period of time. I still use the PerioWash (as I LOVE the wonderful antibacterial herbs!), but I have reservations about it because it has vegetable glycerin as an ingredient, as well. Earth Paste seems to be the most simple, yet most effective, toothpaste I have come across to date. I LOVE that it contains tea tree oil! This is an expensive oil to buy, which is one of the main reasons that I haven&#x27;t made my own toothpaste yet, so I&#x27;m glad that I can get it in Earth Paste. In my opinion, just a good, simple toothpaste that feels good on my teeth and gums :)</li>
    <li> I love earthpaste! My teeth feel more clean now compared to when I used regular toothpaste. I love that my kids can use it and swallow it! I won&#x27;t ever go back to regular toothpaste again.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever bothered to review, but I&#x27;m taking the time to do so because it&#x27;s that good.  Impressed by the very clean/pure ingredient list, I decided to give EarthPaste a try.  WOW!!  My teeth feel like they&#x27;ve just been through a professional cleaning--twice a day--every day.  They literally have never felt so squeaky clean.  They seem whiter, too.  I&#x27;m looking forward to my next checkup and the feedback I&#x27;ll get from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of very few natural toothpastes that is glycerin-free.  This is a good thing!  Glycerin may leave a fine coating on the teeth which prevents the enamel from remineralizing.  One downside is that Earthpaste isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;foamy,&amp;#34; so you find yourself using more.  Also, the tube can be a bit tough to squeeze as you get down to the bottom.  But as good as it is in every other way, these two complaints are minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Earthpaste contains bentonite clay, and yes, bentonite clay contains minute particulates of lead, along with numerous other naturally-occuring minerals.  Does this concern me?  No, I&#x27;m not ingesting the product.  In fact, some of the healthiest people in the organic and whole foods world EAT bentonite clay for it&#x27;s powerful cleansing and detoxing properties.  Some &amp;#34;in the know&amp;#34; argue that these particulates, even when ingested, are of a molecular consistency which is not absorbed into the bloodstream.  If, however, this doesn&#x27;t feel right for you, continue your search for the one that DOES feel right.  I truly believe in following one&#x27;s gut instinct on things, and this will differ from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinnamon is my favorite because it&#x27;s mild.  The flavor was unusual at first, but it quickly grew on me, and now I much prefer it to &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; toothpastes.  I haven&#x27;t tried wintermint, but the peppermint is extremely strong, so much so that I had to rinse my mouth out about 10 times (literally) to get the flavor diluted afterwards.  Too much for me.  But for those who love peppermint, they may find that flavor very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______&lt;br /&gt;Update Aug. 2012:  My dental exam was sterling!  :)</li>
    <li> I love the cinnamon flavor, naturally great!</li>
    <li> We love Earthpaste!!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought it for my fiancee because he&#x27;s not a fan of mint toothpastes, and yes he likes it, but he prefers your lemon twist toothpaste instead, however, I positively LOVE this toothpaste. The cinnamon is there without overkill. :)</li>
    <li> it contains lead? I&#x27;m a nursing mom and that&#x27;s not okay with me.</li>
    <li> Natural tasting, no chemicals</li>
    <li> My kids hate any mint flavored natural tooth paste and I can&#x27;t stand fruit ones.  I get canker sores from using SLS and my kids are young enough they swallow the toothpaste still so this toothpaste is perfect for all of us.  The cinnamon is not burning intense like many cinnamon candies or gums are.  It&#x27;s a nice strong flavor, but no burn so my two year olds love it.  It cleans incredibly well and I love that it is completely non toxic.  I will never be using another brand of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s great, however guests don&#x27;t like it very much. Little too muddy for them, I guess.</li>
    <li> I have tried natural toothpastes in the past.  They don&#x27;t foam up as much or sometimes at all.  Earthpaste doesn&#x27;t foam at all.  It contains only natural ingredients that are safe to eat.  It still gives you a nice flavor as you brush, and it really is the brushing part that is important, not just swishing some flavored goop around in your mouth.  Personally, I have a problem that (especially when I eat carbs and/or sugar) that plaque builds up on my teeth and they feel \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; for lack of a better word.  When I started using this toothpaste, the plaque feeling cleared up and stays away for a long time!  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It only takes a small amount of the paste.</li>
