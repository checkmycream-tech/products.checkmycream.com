      <li>I love, love shiny nails and this does the trick.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I use it as a top coat on my nails when I do my manicure.  </li>
      <li>This is the shiniest, most durable topcoat there is out there.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many, many top coats that claim to protect nails against chipping and peeling.  </li>
      <li>I even put it on top of color</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years</li>
      <li>I get ATLEAST 3 days or more without chipping, even when doing dishes which is unheard of for me without it.  </li>
      <li>I&amp;#34;m grateful for any product that helps me get more days out of a manicure.  </li>
      <li>My nails look so glossy and they feel so smooth when I run my fingertips over them!.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite top coat.  </li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>I use this as my top coat.</li>
      <li>It leaves a very nice shine and dries fast.</li>
      <li>I love it very shine and fast transaction! !!!!!</li>
      <li>but this particular &#x27;shine&#x27; is great--</li>
      <li>The top coat comes out fairly even and very shiny.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure my review was accurate</li>
      <li>That promise incredible shine, but this has been the ONLY one that has held up to these promises.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen Mega Shine Nail Treatment is a wonderful top coat to use to prevent nail polish from chipping in a a few days.  </li>
      <li>Love the super shine.</li>
      <li>plus is the shine was great for the short time that it lasted.</li>
      <li>I have natural nails and found this provided good sheen and protection.  </li>
      <li>The original product is way thicker like a liquid glue.</li>
      <li>I used it as soon as I opened it when I arrived home.&lt;br /&gt;Overall satisfied with the top coat and will most likely purchase again...</li>
      <li>Works the best, just hard to find now in stores.</li>
      <li>This top coat really makes your nails shine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super shiny</li>
      <li>Works well over matte or glossy polish and drys quickly.</li>
      <li>I am the lucky one.</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen&#x27;s &#x27;Hard as Nails&#x27; and &#x27;Top Coat&#x27; work much better!!</li>
      <li>It not only helps protect polish from chipping, but it also has a quick dry additive and it gives your nails a shiny finish that looks brilliant!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this product for several years and absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>Actually to me they look better than some salons that I&#x27;ve been to!</li>
      <li>Worth the stink, but</li>
      <li>Point made, is that I remove and fresh apply once a week, every 5-6 days...</li>
      <li>That say they will keep manicure fresh for up to a week or longer.</li>
      <li>sally hansen is the best for natural or fake nails, salon care and better at home!&lt;br</li>
      <li>But with a little coaxing, you can get a fairly even coat.&lt;br</li>
      <li>give a finished shine on top of the last coat of whatever you&#x27;re using.</li>
      <li>I did a french manicure yesterday, used this as the top coat and today it is peeling off.</li>
      <li>This top coat definitely makes it look super professional.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to use this to do my nails at the end of the day, and then go to bed a reasonable 30 minutes later without any smudging.  </li>
      <li>This topcoat proved to be true to its name, with the shine being more intense than other topcoats I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I have bought bottle after bottle and I highly recommend it!  </li>
      <li>It is not even close to the real product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really get my nails done at a salon ever</li>
      <li>I really like this product and give it my highest rating.  </li>
      <li>Sally Hansen has really come into it&#x27;s own in the last few years; it used to be really cheap</li>
      <li>Dries fast *to the touch in 2 minutes</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Goes on smoothly and even if you put a bit too much it will still dry quickly&lt;</li>
      <li>and my expectations weren&#x27;t high.</li>
      <li>I literally do my own manicure late in the evenings once a week.  </li>
      <li>Well, we live and learn.</li>
      <li>Even when I do get a chance to treat myself to a salon manicure I bring this along and make them put this on as my top coat instead of the stuff they usually use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was a big issue for me previously as I work at a computer all day and typing will tend to cause the polish to wear off the tips of your nails more rapidly.  </li>
      <li>as early as 2 days after manicure.  </li>
      <li>so I guess this is what professional looks like.</li>
      <li>I decided to give this one a try despite only having one review, but all I was going after was those 2 things: shine and fast drying.</li>
      <li>Hansen Mega Shine Treatment purchased from Universe Trading is actually VERY inferior to the same product I have purchased from Walgreen&#x27;s and Plenty Cosas (seller on Amazon).  </li>
      <li>Thank goodness, I had not thrown away the old bottle.  </li>
      <li>If for some reason you do get a nick or smudge in your polish you can apply another thick coat of this and it magically smooths out/fixes the nick or smudge in seconds.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love that you can put this over wet or dry polish and it seems to set everything and dry really fast.  </li>
      <li>Not worth it, although it goes on nice, drys in a timely manner, much faster than Hard as Nails of the Hansen line.  </li>
      <li>I purchased it new in box from local drug store.</li>
      <li>It really does last too....7-8 days no chipping or peeling until my next polish time.  </li>
      <li>My polish lasts at least 3 times as long with this product, and it looks significantly more professional.  </li>
      <li>This clear coat peeled off my nails as sheets in the same day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the most amazing top coat ever!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and I could immediately tell that the product from this vendor was fake. It sounds like shaking water when you shake the bottle. The original product is way thicker like a liquid glue. It seems to me they diluted it with nail polish thinner or put some sort of weird liquid in to fill in the volume. It smells like rotten gas or even worse. It is not even close to the real product. It doesn&#x27;t make your nail polish shine at all. It actually works like a nail polish thinner when you apply it. I asked for a refund to the vendor and they wanted me to send it back. I assume they were expecting me to pay for the shipping since they gave no shipping label but just an address for return. My advice is, don&#x27;t ever buy any nail products from 3rd party vendors from Amazon. I am having a simliar issue with another vendor.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product I buy as topcoat for my nails but it&#x27;s almost $7 a bottle in my store and low and behold I found this for under $2 a bottle at Amamzon. This is the shiniest, most durable topcoat there is out there. I am the lucky one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and my expectations weren&#x27;t high. I was thinking it would dry my polish faster and that&#x27;s about it! I was sooo wrong! This polish is so amazing!!! Not only does it dry my color polish faster but my nails look like I just left the salon!!..Actually to me they look better than some salons that I&#x27;ve been to! My nails look so glossy and they feel so smooth when I run my fingertips over them!. I hope Sally Hansen keeps on making Mega Shine b/c I love this product and it&#x27;s saving me tons of money by not having to go to the nail salon!</li>
    <li> Useless, start chipping the next day after application.  Sally Hansen&#x27;s &#x27;Hard as Nails&#x27; and &#x27;Top Coat&#x27; work much better!!</li>
    <li> I use this as my top coat. It leaves a very nice shine and dries fast. My manicure doesn&#x27;t really last all that long though. 3-4 days tops. I don&#x27;t think this smells bad. It&#x27;s a nice finish to a manicure.</li>
    <li> I love it very shine and fast transaction! !!!!!</li>
    <li> This works great for shine and a top coat.  I have natural nails and found this provided good sheen and protection.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  One of The Best nail products ever.  It only lost a star because the smell is truly horrible and near toxic.  The reviewer who described the smell as &amp;#34;3X worse than regular polish&amp;#34; was pretty much dead on.  However, it works!!!  I am ridiculously rough on polished nails, and incredibly impatient about drying them.  This cures both ills.  My polish lasts at least 3 times as long with this product, and it looks significantly more professional.  I&#x27;m able to use this to do my nails at the end of the day, and then go to bed a reasonable 30 minutes later without any smudging.  Genius.  Worth the stink, but I DO recommend using in a well ventilated room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do abide by the instruction to apply &amp;#34;one THICK coat.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love, love shiny nails and this does the trick. Gets thick quickly otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. The top coat comes out fairly even and very shiny.  I wish the product went on smoother, especially since its so shiny! But with a little coaxing, you can get a fairly even coat.&lt;br /&gt;To give you background on the product. I purchased it new in box from local drug store. I used it as soon as I opened it when I arrived home.&lt;br /&gt;Overall satisfied with the top coat and will most likely purchase again... But this time from Amazon since it was quite a bit cheaper (even when it was on sale in store)</li>
    <li> When I opened the bottle, the brush was not attached to the stopper.  Thank goodness, I had not thrown away the old bottle.  If this hadn&#x27;t happened, I would have rated it a 5 star item.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this though amazon,  but i did want to write a review.  Im not sure how the other reviews are so high. I did a french manicure yesterday, used this as the top coat and today it is peeling off. I do wash my hands &amp;#34;alot&amp;#34; due to working in a public building and then add lotion, and my left hand has completely peeled away leaving the french manicure &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; portion. I have to say that it does not hold up to my expectations. Sorry Sally not a good product for a frequent hand washer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus is the shine was great for the short time that it lasted.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> It works great on my nails.</li>
    <li> sally hansen is the best for natural or fake nails, salon care and better at home!&lt;br /&gt;sally hansen is the best</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen has really come into it&#x27;s own in the last few years; it used to be really cheap and that&#x27;s no longer the case but this particular &#x27;shine&#x27; is great--great shine and evens your nails out if you use it for under your first coat of polish.&lt;br /&gt;and give a finished shine on top of the last coat of whatever you&#x27;re using. Good to have!</li>
    <li> My favorite topcoat in all the nail polish market! I only use this one and reorder when I run out!</li>
    <li> Great shine.  Durable.  Arrived earlier than expected.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Works the best, just hard to find now in stores.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this one a try despite only having one review, but all I was going after was those 2 things: shine and fast drying. This top coat definitely makes it look super professional. I don&#x27;t really get my nails done at a salon ever so I guess this is what professional looks like. But I do paint my nails an average of 2 times a week and dislike waiting for hours for the polish to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on smoothly and even if you put a bit too much it will still dry quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Dries fast *to the touch in 2 minutes, you can start doing things in like 10&lt;br /&gt;  * I even put it on top of color I know takes forever to dry&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s super shiny&lt;br /&gt;- You get a lot for the price&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;- I am not taking off a star because of this (it could be caused by the color nail polish) but when I&#x27;ve just showered or after doing the dishes, it seems like the edges could peel off. I leave it alone and after a few minutes it&#x27;s back to normal. Will come back with an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it is a good product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Shocked at the good reviews. This clear coat peeled off my nails as sheets in the same day. This is a negative on the product, not the vender</li>
    <li> So disappointed in this Hansen product... I did my nails the day before an family event, and while sitting at the table the polish had pealed away on several of the nails.  What ?  Yes, it did.  Embarressing.  Not worth it, although it goes on nice, drys in a timely manner, much faster than Hard as Nails of the Hansen line.  It did it a second time 3 days ago.  Out of convenience I have tried the 3rd time, waiting on this result.  Point made, is that I remove and fresh apply once a week, every 5-6 days... the lift occurred on day 2.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many, many top coats that claim to protect nails against chipping and peeling.  That say they will keep manicure fresh for up to a week or longer. That promise incredible shine, but this has been the ONLY one that has held up to these promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus part of this AWESOME top coat is that it literally dries in 60 seconds!  I work fulltime and am a single mother of three very active kids.  So I do NOT have time to go to the nail salon on a regular basis.  I literally do my own manicure late in the evenings once a week.  I apply my 2-3 coats of nail polish (pretty thickly) I do not wait for them to dry and then apply a very thick coat of this top coat and go to bed.  I wake up in the am and the polish is dry, shiny and NO hairlines or dings/marks from sleeping!  It&#x27;s amazing stuff!  It really does last too....7-8 days no chipping or peeling until my next polish time.  My nails literally show growth by the cuticle before the shine wears away or the paint chips or peels.  It also prevents the rolling back of polish on the tips.  This was a big issue for me previously as I work at a computer all day and typing will tend to cause the polish to wear off the tips of your nails more rapidly.  But not with this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is and always will be the top coat of choice for me!  Even when I do get a chance to treat myself to a salon manicure I bring this along and make them put this on as my top coat instead of the stuff they usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh almost forgot one last bonus about this product.  If for some reason you do get a nick or smudge in your polish you can apply another thick coat of this and it magically smooths out/fixes the nick or smudge in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great price and just super product.  You have to at least give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great as a top coat to lock in nail designs, gems or decals, also works as a hardener.</li>
    <li> Peeled &amp; chipped immediately. Will not buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for several years and absolutely love it!  I love that you can put this over wet or dry polish and it seems to set everything and dry really fast.  One of my problems was the tips of the polish chipping off, sometimes even within a day but with this product, that does not happen.  I get ATLEAST 3 days or more without chipping, even when doing dishes which is unheard of for me without it.  I have bought bottle after bottle and I highly recommend it!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite top coat.  It not only helps protect polish from chipping, but it also has a quick dry additive and it gives your nails a shiny finish that looks brilliant!</li>
    <li> excellent and fast service. my wife likes the quality and the color and there is fight between her and my girls as whose it belongs to!</li>
    <li> This top coat really makes your nails shine. The effect it gives your nails is almost like gel polish. It also keeps my nails from chipping and breaking. It makes polish last for at least a week.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly and looks great! My go-to product!</li>
    <li> My go to nail polish cover coat.  Great shine, makes nails strong, doesn&#x27;t chip.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great top coat. The shine is amazing. Extended my manicure time by several days. Works well over matte or glossy polish and drys quickly.</li>
    <li> Its good!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> i bought this to replace my seche vite. it smells 3x worse but it doesnt work nearly as well. it also gummed up after 5 uses.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  It does what it claims to do.  It gives an intense shine to the nails (over colored polish at least) that lasts for several days.  I&#x27;ve used this about 4 times and each time, my nails were shiny for about 5 days.  Usually, my manicures last about a week, with several small chips by the end of that time frame.  With this product, my manicures lasted longer and my polish stayed shiny throughout.  I try to use a topcoat every few days, because with housework and the interference of other beauty products, namely hairspray, the finish becomes rather dull.  This topcoat proved to be true to its name, with the shine being more intense than other topcoats I&#x27;ve used.  I&amp;#34;m grateful for any product that helps me get more days out of a manicure.  I really like this product and give it my highest rating.  You can find this topcoat at any Walgreens or CVS or even Walmart, just FYI.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Love the super shine. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen Mega Shine Nail Treatment is a wonderful top coat to use to prevent nail polish from chipping in a a few days.  I use it as a top coat on my nails when I do my manicure.  The following day, I apply another coat.  It also makes your polish shine.  If I use Creative Nail Sticky Base Coat and wear gloves when washing dishes, my nail polish usually doesn&#x27;t chip until after 6 to 7 days.  It takes longer to dry than stated on bottle. I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The above review was made on product purchased at Walgreen&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen Mega Shine Treatment purchased from Universe Trading is actually VERY inferior to the same product I have purchased from Walgreen&#x27;s and Plenty Cosas (seller on Amazon).  I wanted to make sure my review was accurate so I used the product purchased from Universe Trading several times.  Rather than the normal wearing at the tips of nails and chipping 5 To 7 days after manicure, I would look down and all of the polish was gone from the entire nail.  This would start happening as early as 2 days after manicure.  Sometimes I would find the polish in the shape of my nail on the floor.  This is worst than a small chip.  The product from Plenty Cosas has been on my nails for 7 days; and I washed windows and doors on yesterday.  I have one nail with a chip and only one with above normal wearing at the ends.  I purchased my last two bottles at a Walgreen&#x27;s location a few days ago for $3.49 each.  This item isn&#x27;t always in stock at Walgreen&#x27;s and I have never seen it in a Walmart store.  I will throw away two new bottles and a partially used of Mega Shine that I ordered from Universe Trading.  Well, we live and learn.</li>
