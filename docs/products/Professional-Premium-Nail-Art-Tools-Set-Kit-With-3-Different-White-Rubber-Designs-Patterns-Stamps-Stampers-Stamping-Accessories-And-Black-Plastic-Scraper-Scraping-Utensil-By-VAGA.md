### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This set was a good deal for the price I paid.</li>
      <li>It work good for me</li>
      <li>The delivery was good.</li>
      <li>, I thought that would be a good thing.</li>
      <li>Do NOT buy this product for stamping art, Konad is so much better!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>Sizes are OK.</li>
      <li>Konad stamper works better, so I don&#x27;t use these.</li>
      <li>The scraper was ok</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll do even better with some practice.</li>
      <li>received and love it alot</li>
      <li>They do NOT pick-up the image cleanly.</li>
      <li>The rubber pads are not attached to the handles, so the pads tend to fall out when wiped clean.</li>
      <li>I loved that they are white and that makes it easier to see the pattern.</li>
      <li>After removing the pads and washing them in hot soapy water  (the pads fall out really easy)  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have to file it at all, just a quick swipe with an acetone-soaked cosmetic pad did the trick.</li>
      <li>It picks up images just fine, however, I did have to prime it first, because straight out of the package it didn&#x27;t pick up so well.</li>
      <li>Luckily, it&#x27;s pretty squishy, so I can press my nail into it to transfer the image.</li>
      <li>they are really greasy, and somehow sticky.</li>
      <li>Not so much.</li>
      <li>but, again, they do pick-up really well.</li>
      <li>The edge is plastic, running it across the pattern takes too much paint away.</li>
      <li>Shipping was VERY slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>was excited that I would receive them then when they finally came they were broke.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d rather pay $7 for one decent stamp than a pack of these again.</li>
      <li>But the top is falling out so often on the long double sided one I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
      <li>The only thing i enjoy is that they&#x27;re white</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; is a very soft sticky substaince.</li>
      <li>This product literary falls apart before you even use it.</li>
      <li>The rectangular stamper, which is the largest, just barely fits the surface area of my nail, which are medium length.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other stampers that were stiffer that worked very well.</li>
      <li>The rubber is TOO soft and mushy and strangely sticky.</li>
      <li>the nail polish wouldn&#x27;t stick to the white part making it super hard to left the nail polish off</li>

    <li> PROS: 1) I loved that they are white and that makes it easier to see the pattern. 2) Sizes are OK. 3) Scraper is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: 1) They do NOT pick-up the image cleanly. Paint is left behind and makes for weak or &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; transfer. 2) The rubber pads are not attached to the handles, so the pads tend to fall out when wiped clean. 3) The rubber is TOO soft and mushy and strangely sticky. 4) Shipping was VERY slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Konad stamper works better, so I don&#x27;t use these.</li>
    <li> This set was a good deal for the price I paid. I purchased the set specifically for the rectangular stamper. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit smaller than I was expecting, as I didn&#x27;t see any dimensions listed. The rectangular stamper, which is the largest, just barely fits the surface area of my nail, which are medium length. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stamper for anyone with long nais. Luckily, it&#x27;s pretty squishy, so I can press my nail into it to transfer the image. It picks up images just fine, however, I did have to prime it first, because straight out of the package it didn&#x27;t pick up so well. I didn&#x27;t have to file it at all, just a quick swipe with an acetone-soaked cosmetic pad did the trick.</li>
    <li> It work good for me but you need to buff it before you used it. The delivery was good.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this product for stamping art, Konad is so much better! This product literary falls apart before you even use it.</li>
    <li> received and love it alot</li>
    <li> These were awful. They were sticky and squishy. This made it impossible to pick up stamps. The only thing i enjoy is that they&#x27;re white but I&#x27;d rather pay $7 for one decent stamp than a pack of these again.</li>
    <li> The stamper is horrible its too squishy and doesn&#x27;t pick up the paint on the plates, it also took almost two months to arrive. DO NOT purchase it is terrible and not worth the money or frustration</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work even after buffing it and they were a lot smaller than I thought they would be</li>
    <li> Really bad so bad that they don&#x27;t have the 0 star for a reviews</li>
    <li> So diappointed 😖😖 they dont pick up the paints and they&#x27;re stickY i hated them</li>
    <li> I can only get the small round one to work. If I try the double-ended one, the other end pops out. The rectangle won&#x27;t pick up much, and the scraper is kinda worthless :/ Was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t have have to star this. WORST product. Doesn&#x27;t even pick up paint. The stampers fall apart and are pieces of crap. Don&#x27;t waste you time.</li>
    <li> These are way squishy, which I thought was going to be lovley. Alas, they simply do not pick up the paint. Not at all. I&#x27;ve used other stampers that were stiffer that worked very well. I will be buying the firmer stamper.  When they arrive (almost three weeks after ordering) they are really greasy, and somehow sticky. Every animal hair in the area was drawn to it! After removing the pads and washing them in hot soapy water  (the pads fall out really easy)  they are no longer greasy but they are still sticky, I thought that would be a good thing. Not so much. They simply will not pick up any paint.  A word on the scraper: it fails. Period. The edge is plastic, running it across the pattern takes too much paint away. It is simply not rigid enough.</li>
    <li> They keep falling apart and I thought that they would be a harder rubber. The &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; is a very soft sticky substaince. I do NOT recommend this.</li>
    <li> the nail polish wouldn&#x27;t stick to the white part making it super hard to left the nail polish off so i can place it on my nail. worst item i have ever bought</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this product. The rubber white pads keep falling out of the casing and the stamps do not pick up the image from the cheeky image jumbo plates.  Zero stars!  Greasy and will not pick up image</li>
    <li> So disappointed.. It took a while was excited that I would receive them then when they finally came they were broke. I tried putting them back together to see if it would work on a plate. That didn&#x27;t work either. Disappointed I wasted my time and money</li>
    <li> These picked up the art well. But the top is falling out so often on the long double sided one I can&#x27;t even use it. I would not buy that one on it&#x27;s own. These are a bit smaller than I though but, again, they do pick-up really well. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll do even better with some practice.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get any of my polishes to pick up on theses squishy tools. I even roughed up the surface to see if that would help but no luck.</li>
    <li> These sponges didnt pick up the images from the  cheeky plates at all!!! The scraper was ok</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it at all 😒 so disappointed 😒</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pick up the image to transfer. The rubber isn&#x27;t attached to the handle therefore it falls out and falls apart. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this for nail stamping.</li>
    <li> The gel parts are sticky, so dust and other debris sticks and stays on it. The gel parts also fall out of the plastic housing.</li>
