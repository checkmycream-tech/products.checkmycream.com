### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>One of the best Badger products!</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Excellent for soothing sunburned or sun tender skin.</li>
      <li>so use your best judgement when deciding to buy this product--if you have acne-prone skin</li>
      <li>I am fair-skinned, and my skin tends to need a lot of help after a day in the sun - this Bali Balm refreshes the skin, and smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!!</li>
      <li>And it smells so good!</li>
      <li>Absolutely wonderful for Sun kissed or burned skin, refreshing and soothing!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really happy to have found this in their line.</li>
      <li>Badger After Sun Balm is a great product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product I keep on the boat and in my lax bag.</li>
      <li>Great balm...  </li>
      <li>Feels great on sunburned lips too.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>Well, it does have olive oil in it (which is good for your skin).  </li>
      <li>The kids loved putting it on and helping with the sunburn.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, emollient without being greasy and takes the sting out of a day in the sun.</li>
      <li>Badger products smell amazing</li>
      <li>It smells nice and rubs on easily.</li>
      <li>More of an herbal scent, not tropical</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Plus I&#x27;m sure the moisture on my eyes can&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
      <li>Worked better than any eye makup remover I ever used.  </li>
      <li>But the scent is a bit overwhelming, perhaps a tad off-putting.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a more health-friendly alternative to the mass produced petro-chemical after sun lotions out there.  </li>
      <li>Most after sun lotions have an ingredient list longer than a Victor Hugo novel.  </li>
      <li>Even thought I saw lavender oil in the ingredients, I was expecting more of an orange/tropical scent.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the product, just not the scent.</li>
      <li>But those are often the areas, where you need an after sun the most anyway.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite products from Badger.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s all organic.</li>
      <li>It helps heal boo-boos, flesh wounds, and does a FANTASTIC job soothing sunburns!  </li>
      <li>I love this after sun balm and will diff.</li>
      <li>I bought this over the summer before a vacation in OBX because I burn really easily.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>It does a great job by keeping my dry winter skin from itching.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Like many of the reviews love it cause it is all natural.  </li>
      <li>I love Bali Balm, it really does the job.</li>
      <li>However, it dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>Let me say first of all that I have a bias, because of my allergies I can&#x27;t use aloe so this is basically the first after sun product I have ever been able to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge user of Essential Oils and normally make my own things with the EO&#x27;s, but this is an exception!  </li>
      <li>It is absorbed quickly.</li>
      <li>The texture is not as a regular lotion, but more like a canned lip balm so I will say it&#x27;s more suitable for face, neck and chest rather than entire body.</li>
      <li>My husband also liked the scent and applied it daily after the beach.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m unsure what exactly blue tansy smells like on its own, but it seems the lavender and orange scents come through quite strongly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But if you have dry skin like mine, it&#x27;s a great natural alternative to moisturizing cream!</li>
      <li>Water proof mascara came right off, no irritation or blurriness in my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I applied it to my sunburn right before bed</li>
      <li>did read a bit of information on blue tansy its uses and as an essential oil in general, and it does contain quite impressive properties for healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Badger balm products are great for moisturizing the skin, especially the face and any dry spots.</li>
      <li>and I never need to worry that my family is absorbing anything other than good and helpful organic healing ingredients straight from nature.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also found it relieves any dry skin faster than most anything</li>
      <li>That being said, this stuff works really well.</li>
      <li>and it was very soothing to sunburned skin.  </li>
      <li>I took the Sun Balm to Mexico and had no problems with &amp;#34;dry skin lips.&amp;#34;  I now take it to work as this winter has been very unki nd to my skin.</li>
      <li>The main ingredient is olive oil</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product as a soothing balm for after sun care.</li>
      <li>Not so...just natural (for real) stuff--</li>
      <li>Love this balm for after sun or for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Badger has managed to create a complete line of products that is not only organic, but that actually works to keep my skin healthy.</li>
      <li>but well worth it for the relief the next day!</li>
      <li>I live in Florida</li>
      <li>I purchased after reading several positive reviews on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Balm is not as firm as some of the other Badger products and feels more oily, but I found it helps sunburn very fast.</li>
      <li>Second, it might make your skin look a bit greasy if you use too much.  </li>
      <li>It is very soothing and gives almost instant relief.</li>
      <li>It absorbs fast enough that you won&#x27;t leave a slime trail on everything</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Badger Balms for years, mainly the sleep and joint rubs, and this one is just as terrific.</li>
      <li>Extra virgin olive oil, beeswax, jojoba oil, cocoa butter, shea butter, essential oil of lavender, CO2 extract of sea buckthorn berry, essential oils of Moroccan blue tansy, lim, sweet orange, ylang ylang &amp; Sicilian orange.  </li>
      <li>I generally wear a shirt and long shorts in the sun, so I don&#x27;t use this on my whole body.  </li>
      <li>When will I learn that lavender generally overpowers everything else?</li>
      <li>It seems to have a lot of natural ingredients in it such as essential oils of lavender, etc.</li>
      <li>We use Badger sunscreen on a daily basis and then we also use the after sun balm for chapped skin during the winter, especially on my hands that are extra sensitive.</li>
      <li>First, a little goes a long way.  </li>

<li> If I get too much sun for the day I put a thick layer on and it draws out the heat of a sunburn in a second - you are greasy for the night</li>
<li> My skin is very dry and it adds extra moisture</li>

<li> I have been using the Badger Balm brand for years for dry skin on my hands, legs and ankles.</li>
<li> You may think the tin is small, but you really only need a tiny bit for your face and arms.</li>
<li> Slathered on after a day at the beach, turns pink into tan and rehydrated your skin!</li>
<li> Slightly greasy.</li>
<li> If you are unable to use the aloe gel I highly recommend this.</li>
<li> I like the Badger products because they work and are made by a small US business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bali</li>
<li> and we use it for something a few times a week in our family of 8!  </li>
<li> and when I woke up the sunburn was less red and less painful.</li>
<li> Waste of money!!</li>
<li> The can is very small, so</li>
<li> It hates chemicals, artificial fragrance and any dyes or additives.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Absolutely wonderful for Sun kissed or burned skin, refreshing and soothing!</li>
    <li> I bought this over the summer before a vacation in OBX because I burn really easily. Well, it&#x27;s December and I&#x27;m still using it!! I love it. It&#x27;s great for dry skin. I use it after each time I wash my face and before I apply my makeup. The main ingredient is olive oil so use your best judgement when deciding to buy this product--if you have acne-prone skin I&#x27;d probably pass on this one. But if you have dry skin like mine, it&#x27;s a great natural alternative to moisturizing cream!</li>
    <li> This product is terrific for after sun care. Slathered on after a day at the beach, turns pink into tan and rehydrated your skin! Only down side is the greasy feel, it will cause your hair to look greasy if it comes into contact with your newly applied skin.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product as a soothing balm for after sun care. Whenever my skin feels irritated, I know that Bali Badger Balm will help give my skin the soothing relief that I need. It seems to have a lot of natural ingredients in it such as essential oils of lavender, etc. I even use it if I burn myself when cooking. It is very soothing and gives almost instant relief.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a more health-friendly alternative to the mass produced petro-chemical after sun lotions out there.  Most after sun lotions have an ingredient list longer than a Victor Hugo novel.  But this?  Not so...just natural (for real) stuff--Extra virgin olive oil, beeswax, jojoba oil, cocoa butter, shea butter, essential oil of lavender, CO2 extract of sea buckthorn berry, essential oils of Moroccan blue tansy, lim, sweet orange, ylang ylang &amp; Sicilian orange.  That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two notes.  First, a little goes a long way.  You may think the tin is small, but you really only need a tiny bit for your face and arms. A tin of this lasts months.  Me?  I generally wear a shirt and long shorts in the sun, so I don&#x27;t use this on my whole body.  Second, it might make your skin look a bit greasy if you use too much.  Well, it does have olive oil in it (which is good for your skin).  So just take care with the amount, unless you&#x27;re staying in for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually started using this a few nights a week straight through the year.  It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> Let me say first of all that I have a bias, because of my allergies I can&#x27;t use aloe so this is basically the first after sun product I have ever been able to use. That being said, this stuff works really well. I applied it to my sunburn right before bed and when I woke up the sunburn was less red and less painful. And a little bit goes a long way, I was surprised by how far one small tub of this will get you, I expect mine to last months.  If you are unable to use the aloe gel I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Even thought I saw lavender oil in the ingredients, I was expecting more of an orange/tropical scent. When will I learn that lavender generally overpowers everything else? I love the product, just not the scent.</li>
    <li> Flower and citrus smell. It brings the mood up. Slightly greasy. Leaves skin hydrated and smoothe. Doesnt create rashes or breakouts. I have sensitive skin. Convenient tin for carrying in purse. Others have commented on liking the smell</li>
    <li> I am fair-skinned, and my skin tends to need a lot of help after a day in the sun - this Bali Balm refreshes the skin, and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> My skin hates everything. It hates chemicals, artificial fragrance and any dyes or additives. Badger has managed to create a complete line of products that is not only organic, but that actually works to keep my skin healthy. We use Badger sunscreen on a daily basis and then we also use the after sun balm for chapped skin during the winter, especially on my hands that are extra sensitive.

    <li> I took the Sun Balm to Mexico and had no problems with &amp;#34;dry skin lips.&amp;#34;  I now take it to work as this winter has been very unki nd to my skin.</li>
    <li> Badger After Sun Balm is a great product.  I purchased after reading several positive reviews on Amazon.  I used this on a trip to Mexico in July and it was very soothing to sunburned skin.  The smell is wonderful. My husband also liked the scent and applied it daily after the beach.  We are going on another trip next month and I will be purchasing again.  Feels great on sunburned lips too.</li>
    <li> Great balm...  works well...  it is actually soothing... Just wish the container was larger!</li>
    <li> Excellent for soothing sunburned or sun tender skin. More of an herbal scent, not tropical but it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> Waste of money!! This did nothing for relief</li>
    <li> I like the Badger products because they work and are made by a small US business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bali Balm is not as firm as some of the other Badger products and feels more oily, but I found it helps sunburn very fast. It absorbs fast enough that you won&#x27;t leave a slime trail on everything you touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found it relieves any dry skin faster than most anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent but it&#x27;s not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product I keep on the boat and in my lax bag.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Badger Balm brand for years for dry skin on my hands, legs and ankles. The Bali Balm is a softer product out of the tin than the regular Badger Balm. It is absorbed quickly. It does a great job by keeping my dry winter skin from itching. It does not leave your skin feeling like you rubbed Vaseline on your skin. I love Bali Balm, it really does the job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell.  However, it dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> I like it okay. But the scent is a bit overwhelming, perhaps a tad off-putting. I&#x27;m unsure what exactly blue tansy smells like on its own, but it seems the lavender and orange scents come through quite strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read a bit of information on blue tansy its uses and as an essential oil in general, and it does contain quite impressive properties for healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Badger balm products are great for moisturizing the skin, especially the face and any dry spots.</li>
    <li> Like many of the reviews love it cause it is all natural.  If I get too much sun for the day I put a thick layer on and it draws out the heat of a sunburn in a second - you are greasy for the night but well worth it for the relief the next day!</li>
    <li> My whole family used this everyday while we were in Aruba.  It makes your skin feel so soft and moisturized, rather than tight and dry after being in the sun all day.  I realized that I didn&#x27;t pack anything to remove my water-proof eye makeup while on vacation, so since this balm is oil based, I gave it a try.  Worked better than any eye makup remover I ever used.  Water proof mascara came right off, no irritation or blurriness in my eyes.  Plus I&#x27;m sure the moisture on my eyes can&#x27;t hurt.  One of the best Badger products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge user of Essential Oils and normally make my own things with the EO&#x27;s, but this is an exception!  It helps heal boo-boos, flesh wounds, and does a FANTASTIC job soothing sunburns!  I get it for everything and we use it for something a few times a week in our family of 8!  Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products from Badger. I live in Florida and I&#x27;m really happy to have found this in their line. I&#x27;ve used Badger Balms for years, mainly the sleep and joint rubs, and this one is just as terrific. Smells amazing, emollient without being greasy and takes the sting out of a day in the sun. My skin is very dry and it adds extra moisture so I even use it as a night moisturizer. I love it. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! We got it for vacation and used it every day. The kids loved putting it on and helping with the sunburn. I love that it&#x27;s all organic. And it smells so good! A must for any beach vacation!</li>
    <li> Love this balm for after sun or for everyday use. It smells nice and rubs on easily.</li>
    <li> I love this after sun balm and will diff. buy again. The texture is not as a regular lotion, but more like a canned lip balm so I will say it&#x27;s more suitable for face, neck and chest rather than entire body. But those are often the areas, where you need an after sun the most anyway. The can is very small, so I recommend you find a supplement product if you use after sun on your entire body.</li>
