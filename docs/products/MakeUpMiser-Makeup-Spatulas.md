      <li>I was happy with these little spatulas the minute I got them home!</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t realize how much product you&#x27;re tossing away until you use these things!  </li>

      <li>I love it and don&#x27;t know how I lived without it so long.</li>

      <li>these handy little spatulas</li>
      <li>so i don&#x27;t really have any thoughts on this product.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>

<li> these wands do come in handy to get every inch of my expensive foundations/creams.</li>
<li> They really do work and get all that extra product out of small containers.</li>
<li> What you don&#x27;t realize from the picture is how long they are (8&amp;#34; maybe?)</li>
<li> Always felt that it&#x27;s such a waste when there is that last bit of cream or lotion stuck in the bottle</li>
<li> I an saving myself lots of money in the long run!!</li>
<li> I got soooo tired of throwing out lotion, shampoo and conditioner bottles with product clearly still left inside.  </li>
<li> now I can empty a bottle of all the lotion .</li>
<li> Well made and the three sizes provides one with a tool to get down to the bottom and sides of those jars.  </li>
<li> It says it&#x27;s small, but the Spatty is smaller and I would recommend that one for your small makeup bottles.</li>
<li> I can either pop the tops off of the bottles or in some cases just cut them in half and then scrape the product into little plastic jar pots I purchased inexpensively from the Target store sample/Travel size section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> with these i can get every little drop of product out.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m already thinking these might be just the little gift for my friends &amp;#34;who</li>
<li> I began using one of these skinny spatulas just a few days ago.</li>
<li> I thought the smallest one would be small....</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too thick to pour out into my hand.&lt;br</li>
<li> I was about to throw away an &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34; of one of those expensive eye creams, but waited for these to arrive:  </li>
<li> i spend a lot of money on cosmetics and sometimes they are expensive.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product!Can now get more of  my makeup,etc now without wasting or throwing my item away when their is still some in bottle!</li>
    <li> For all those tiny makeup or lotion bottles I get at Sephora, this trio helps you get to the last drop!</li>
    <li> Works great and scoops out every last drop! This product, I believe pays for itself. I was about to throw away my glass container because i could no longer get the last remaining foundation out. I found this online and purchased it. It works amazingly! I like having different sizes too because i can use them for numerous things within my makeup cabinet. I have already gotten 5 days out of my left over foundation that i was going to throw out! I&#x27;m also still using that same foundation, i believe i can get 1-2 more days out of it depending on how heavy i layer it haha.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted me to order these items for her.  so i don&#x27;t really have any thoughts on this product.</li>
    <li> They work great if they fit your container.  They are bigger than they look and dont fit small bottles.  Great for getting the last of lotions and makeups.</li>
    <li> The MakeUpMiser is one of the best purchases I ever made! I get an additional 2 weeks out of my Este Lauder foundation and I recently realized I can scrape out the edges of my eyeshadow too! Works for liquids and powders! I love the size of each spatula, as they fit great in my different size bottles and tubs wonderfully. What a great product! i highly recommend it to everyone![[ASIN:B003ZZPLGA MakeUpMiser]]</li>
    <li> Seems unwieldy somehow, but have not had a container to try them on.  The picture is misleading - I thought the smallest one would be small....it is not.</li>
    <li> I love these spatulas because they are long and can reach into tall lotion bottles, as well as short bottles too.  It&#x27;s great that there are 3 different spatula sizes.  The lengths are the same, just the rubber spatula part has different sizes.  These are meeting my &amp;#34;good to the last drop&amp;#34; needs perfectly!  I&#x27;m very pleased with these.</li>
    <li> Such great tools to get the products out.  Always felt that it&#x27;s such a waste when there is that last bit of cream or lotion stuck in the bottle &amp; you can&#x27;t get it out.  You don&#x27;t realize how much product you&#x27;re tossing away until you use these things!  I was able to use my cream for another 2 weeks!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Too large for most bottles.</li>
    <li> i spend a lot of money on cosmetics and sometimes they are expensive.  with these i can get every little drop of product out.  great for anyone who wants to get every pennys worth from their money.</li>
    <li> I was looking at other items like this, but this one came with 3 different sizes of spatulas for a great price.  When I received, they were even better in person!  They are made very well and really do get to the bottom of makeup jars. I have no doubt these will save a lot of money.  Everyone who uses serums and makeup should get these.  Well done Michelle!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these spatulas! They fit in everything and have saved me tons of normally wasted product! I have given several as gifts &amp; everyone tells me how it has been the greatest gift! I use them in the kitchen too. They are great for spice &amp; condiment containers, so now I plan to get another set.</li>
    <li> Good product, the quality of the materials are good, and the scoops just fine. What a genius idea!</li>
    <li> Amazing what  I needed . I use it to get all my foundation from Mac product and it is tight but worked perfectly I cannot ask for more . It get the small container i have for foundation and my favorite cream</li>
    <li> Work great on basically any bottle, any size.</li>
    <li> Purchased to see if I could use on bottle of makeup.  It works great and cleaned the bottle.  No wasted makeup anymore!</li>
    <li> too big for my bottles</li>
    <li> I was happy with these little spatulas the minute I got them home! I use a nice moisturizer so I want every drop! And it also helps me with portion control so my products last longer! They work great in my bare minerals containers as well. Thanks makeup miser!!</li>
    <li> Well made and the three sizes provides one with a tool to get down to the bottom and sides of those jars.  Quit wasting product and buy yourself a set of these!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I was hesitant to pay &#x27;so much&#x27; for these little gadgets, but I already have gotten so much use from them.

I&#x27;m already thinking these might be just the little gift for my friends &amp;#34;who have everything&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The name is fitting..makeup miser. It really helps you get the last drop of lotion out. The different sizes are quite good.</li>
    <li> I got soooo tired of throwing out lotion, shampoo and conditioner bottles with product clearly still left inside.  On some lotions, not matter how much you squeezed you could not get the product that was coated on the side of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these handy little spatulas I can either pop the tops off of the bottles or in some cases just cut them in half and then scrape the product into little plastic jar pots I purchased inexpensively from the Target store sample/Travel size section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are super durable and easy to clean off after each use.  I love them so much I am now going to purchase a second set for condiments and other food items that stick to THEIR containers.  These things will pay for themselves in no time.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> This has quickly become one of my favorite tools. Handle is long enough is to get in long tubes...just love it.</li>
    <li> It says it&#x27;s small, but the Spatty is smaller and I would recommend that one for your small makeup bottles.</li>
    <li> Does all that it is advertised to do. Nuff said. Does all that it is advertised to do. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Silas Marner&#x27;s wife would have loved these as much as I do! With the price of some cosmetic products these days they are a huge saving tool.  All my friends are going to get them as gifts!</li>
    <li> This product allows you to get every last drop out of just about anything. I love it and don&#x27;t know how I lived without it so long. It&#x27;s sure saves some money too, as you don&#x27;t have to throw away that last bit.</li>
    <li> these wands do come in handy to get every inch of my expensive foundations/creams.</li>
    <li> great product.  good seller</li>
    <li> I began using one of these skinny spatulas just a few days ago. It works great! It gets around the edges and &amp;#34;shoulders&amp;#34; of bottles. My favorite moisturizer comes with a pump dispenser, but when the dispenser runs dry, I have to throw it out. It&#x27;s too thick to pour out into my hand.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve gotten SEVEN more full-face applications of moisturizer, and there&#x27;s still more in the bottle. I am happy that I am using all of that pricey lotion I love so much!&lt;br /&gt;And, my husband used one on a mustard jar, before I caught him. :)</li>
    <li> Great product and just what I needed to get into those pesky bottles and get a few days more use&lt;br /&gt;out of my products.  Works perfectly.  Thank you.  J</li>
    <li> Product works well. It&#x27;s nice that it comes in a package of three different sizes. Really gets all of the product out of your bottles. The long handles make it easy to maneuver in the smallest opening.</li>
    <li> I love it. now I can empty a bottle of all the lotion . There is weeks of lotion left in the bottom of hand lotions that you cannot get out using the pump</li>
    <li> I so needed this thing!! I an saving myself lots of money in the long run!! They really do work and get all that extra product out of small containers.</li>
