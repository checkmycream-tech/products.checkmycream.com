      <li>My Girls Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to get healthy hair for over a year now</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m spending more money than I wanted to.</li>
      <li>OKAY, THIS WAS ADVERTISED IN THE MALL</li>
      <li>My friend introduced me to the real Royale that she purchased at the Kiosk in the mall and it worked great.</li>
      <li>I got this for my wife after seeing the demonstration they do in the Malls, but I&#x27;m not quite sure, but I do beleive that this is not an original product like the one they sell in the Mall, is not bad but is not as good as the original</li>
      <li>It works really great on heating up and leaving my hair soft and manageable after using it.</li>
      <li>Chi works so much better and is worth spending more money on.</li>
      <li>It also includes a 5 minute instructional DVD so curling with the straightener was easy to catch on to.  </li>
      <li>But an adapter to fit the Australian receptacles and your good to go!</li>
      <li>so anyways, I wanted to give it a try because when that Italian sales man tried on my hair, curl looked beautiful and shiny.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have really fine hair.</li>
      <li>and I would say that I definitely got what I paid for--this straightener isn&#x27;t that great in quality, but it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I originally saw this product at a kiosk in the mall, the guy wanted $150 for it.  </li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor and buy the true product.</li>
      <li>The lady used this flat iron on her hair and the steam that was produced was alot and her hair was beautiful and straight.</li>
      <li>heats quickly</li>
      <li>However, i would love to love this item it has a tiny kink..</li>
      <li>works exactly the same which is good</li>
      <li>I loved it enough to think about it, but wanted to research it first.  </li>
      <li>BUT I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO SPEND $300.00 BUCKS BECAUSE I RARELY STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR</li>
      <li>the curls did not stay worth a darn</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the flat iron considering it looks exactly like the ones from the mall</li>
      <li>Heats up super fast!</li>
      <li>It does heat up and get very hot, which causes it to be too hot to touch the plastic up where to plates are located.</li>
      <li>I was excited to find out if this straightener was the real thing.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the full size large version.</li>
      <li>, THE ONE IN THE MALL FELT NICE AND SMOOTH AS THE REP PULLED DOWN TO STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR.</li>
      <li>This flat iron looks nice and works okay, but there is a difference between this flat iron and the one they sell in malls.</li>
      <li>Not only was it straight, it was super smooth and shiny!</li>
      <li>This iron is EXACTLY the same as the ones being sold at the mall kiosks for more than $150.  </li>
      <li>The Zebra Nano was able to both straighten or curl my hair, so I only needed to take one appliance.  </li>
      <li>Even my stubborn wavy roots came out really straight!</li>
      <li>It does not heat as hot as the one I have been using.  </li>
      <li>The product was exactly what it shows in the add.</li>
      <li>absolutely love this flat iron and price.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to completely straighten my 4c hair, but do help with a nice blown out look.</li>
      <li>and it is exactly what we bought for $100, much cheaper</li>
      <li>My beloved real Royale unfortunately fell on the floor one too many times and the plate broke.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much when I was buying this online, after all it is under half the price that my mom paid for it</li>
      <li>how soft and pretty it made my hair feel though!</li>
      <li>but so far it works great and works better than any other hair straightener I have used in the past.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s really hard to find a good straightener that works well with so much hair.  </li>
      <li>, IT GETS STRAIGHT</li>
      <li>This straightener did not heat up very well.</li>
      <li>The straightener stopped heating up and the red light wouldn&#x27;t turn off after 5 months.</li>
      <li>But the price was very different.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
      <li>Take it from someone who had a real Royale.</li>
      <li>I was very upset</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>and I will say that I didn&#x27;t really care for it then either.</li>
      <li>The real Royale has numbers listed in Celsius on the dial.</li>
      <li>I am very confused.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>It works the way any other straightener should and it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
      <li>This iron does not get hot enough or hot as the one displayed in the mall</li>
      <li>However when I was told the iron normally sells for $300 but is on sale for $150 I immediately ushered my daughter out of the chair and on our way.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to flatten the hair straight.</li>
      <li>I was my first \\&quot;high paid flat iron\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>The product was exactly the same as the one i purchased at the mall for a hundred dollars</li>
      <li>One of them stopped heating on one plate and the second one stopped getting hot.</li>
      <li>though I was getting the exact same iron like in the mall.</li>

<ol>
    <li> So far so good. Hair feels so soft and I can tell the difference within a few days! Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> My Girls Love it. It takes less time to do there hair and it does it quicker that the other hair flat irons they have used in the past</li>
    <li> My Teenage Girls and I think this Product Works great one of them even had there hair straightened by the Royale Straightener in the mall so it does the same thing.</li>
    <li> Works great, plan to purchase another as a gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this and had it for 3 weeks and dropped it and the one plat broke in half which meant I could not longer use it. While I did use it before I dropped it and I will say that I didn&#x27;t really care for it then either. This straightener did not heat up very well.</li>
    <li> did not work the way the stylist said it would sorry had to send it back. the curls did not stay worth a darn</li>
    <li> OKAY, THIS WAS ADVERTISED IN THE MALL FOR LIKE $300.00 AND WHEN THE REP STRAIGHTEN MY NATURALLY CURLY HAIR IT LOOKED AWESOME BUT I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO SPEND $300.00 BUCKS BECAUSE I RARELY STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR SO I SEARCHED AMAZON. THIS FLAT IRON FEELS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THEN THE ONE IN THE MALL, IT GETS STRAIGHT BUT IT KINDA FEELS ROUGH WHEN YOU ARE PULLING IT DOWN TO STRAIGHTEN, THE ONE IN THE MALL FELT NICE AND SMOOTH AS THE REP PULLED DOWN TO STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;ve only had this straightener for a a little over a month but so far it works great and works better than any other hair straightener I have used in the past.  I have really thick hair so it&#x27;s really hard to find a good straightener that works well with so much hair.  The price is really good for a product that works this well.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this flat iron and price. heats quickly and I can have my hair straightened in under 10 min. learned to curl with it, a bit tricky, but way easier than a curling iron. way better price then the  mall wanted.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these in the mall Christmas 2012, and they both aren&#x27;t working anymore. One of them stopped heating on one plate and the second one stopped getting hot. I paid almost $200 for them together, not worth it. They lasted just long enough to go over 1 year warranty and quit.</li>
    <li> Great deal. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to completely straighten my 4c hair, but do help with a nice blown out look.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly the same as the one i purchased at the mall for a hundred dollars and it was sold to me for only 32! works exactly the same which is good cause i love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product that I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I use it everyday and the condition of my hair is actually improving.</li>
    <li> I have this product for five months and it broke. I take very good care of my tools and will never buy cheap again. Chi works so much better and is worth spending more money on. Waste of money and snagged my hair.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I ended up paying $200 for this at a local mall. I&#x27;ve had this iron for over 2 years. I was my first \\&quot;high paid flat iron\\&quot;. It does heat up and get very hot, which causes it to be too hot to touch the plastic up where to plates are located. This DOES burn my hair, even when I have it at a lower heat setting. I have really fine hair. I&#x27;ve been trying to get healthy hair for over a year now and this flat iron seems to be pushing me in the opposite direction. Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I went to a mall. These Italian guys were very aggressively selling this product. They told me it&#x27;s made in Italy. But the price was very different.&lt;br /&gt;At the mall, they were selling it for over $100 whereas on Amazon, it&#x27;s only around $40.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s the same packaging and same product name. I am very confused.&lt;br /&gt;Well so anyways, I wanted to give it a try because when that Italian sales man tried on my hair, curl looked beautiful and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it said \\&quot;Made in China.\\&quot; hmmm.. Ok.. Maybe that&#x27;s why the price was different.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I couldn&#x27;t tell which temperature I am using at because it&#x27;s place inside and its hard to tell. So I simply had to guess!&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it wouldn&#x27;t go down smoothly when I compare it to my other flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;So I am returning it and the return shipping is over $11 dollars. Wasted a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s usable but not great.</li>
    <li> I was ecstatic once I found this product on Amazon for only $40 because my aunt brought her&#x27;s from the mall for over a hundred dollars. Once I received mine and used it I was very upset I didn&#x27;t get the same results as when I used my aunts. The metal plates inside are suppose to be tan/copper not black. In reality it was a waste of $40 that I could&#x27;ve just put towards the REAL one at the mall. Now I&#x27;m spending more money than I wanted to.</li>
    <li> This flat iron looks nice and works okay, but there is a difference between this flat iron and the one they sell in malls. I cannot manage to get my hair as straight and beautiful looking as they were able to at the mall kiosk. It is also difficult to curl hair using this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I originally saw this product at a kiosk in the mall, the guy wanted $150 for it.  After the demo he did on my hair I loved it enough to think about it, but wanted to research it first.  When I saw it on Amazon for only $45 I jumped on it.  It has done wonders on my hair which is naturally curly, soft and fine with tight ringlets in the back of my head.  I have had problems with other straighteners leaving my hair dried, damaged and frizzy.  This straightener is the fasted by far with the best results! It also includes a 5 minute instructional DVD so curling with the straightener was easy to catch on to.  My hair usually wont hold a curl with a curling iron all day unless I use a ton of product AND extra hold hair spray.  But with this iron I don&#x27;t even have to use product, the curls hold all day and into the next (even after sleeping on it).  It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This thing makes you look like beyonce. No complaints. I paid a great price for it and it&#x27;s the full size large version.</li>
    <li> My daughters loves these</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what it shows in the add. They were great getting it to me, and when I had questions they answered right away from their coustomer service.</li>
    <li> I was a loyal CHI user for several years, but I got stopped in a mall and they demonstrated the royale iron on my thick, relaxed, African American hair. Even though I relax it, my hair still gets really frizzy within a few weeks after being at the salon. I was amazed! Not only was it straight, it was super smooth and shiny! Even my stubborn wavy roots came out really straight! I thought my CHI was good, but this is even better. But don&#x27;t buy them from the mall kiosks or even the website. Search online and find a better deal. They tried to sell me one for $250-300, and then they lowered it to $100. I bought it here on amazon for $40, and it&#x27;s the exact same product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife after seeing the demonstration they do in the Malls, but I&#x27;m not quite sure, but I do beleive that this is not an original product like the one they sell in the Mall, is not bad but is not as good as the original</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast! It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have been a chi user for many years, but this iron is fantastic! I also like the fact that you can use it on damp hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the dual voltage feature.  Using a plug adapter for Great Britain, I was able to use the appliance when I travelled to  London, without using a converter.  My hair looked great, too. The Zebra Nano was able to both straighten or curl my hair, so I only needed to take one appliance.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I though I was getting the exact same iron like in the mall. This iron does not get hot enough or hot as the one displayed in the mall</li>
    <li> Do not buy this straightener! It is a bad knock off. My friend introduced me to the real Royale that she purchased at the Kiosk in the mall and it worked great. This was supposed to be the same one as hers and it is completely different. You can tell it&#x27;s fake because it goes up to 450 degrees where as the real ones only go to 250. Also the plates snag your hair and it doesn&#x27;t straighten well at all. My hair looked horrible. Do yourself a favor and buy the true product. Yes it will cost more, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this from the mall for a ridiculous price. I wish I would have researched it more before buying it... The straightener stopped heating up and the red light wouldn&#x27;t turn off after 5 months. Then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all. I did like how soft and pretty it made my hair feel though!</li>
    <li> I just bought this straightener because the one I bought from the mall for $150 broke. My beloved real Royale unfortunately fell on the floor one too many times and the plate broke. I was excited to find out if this straightener was the real thing. It is not. Take it from someone who had a real Royale. One give away is that the dial on this one is in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius. The real Royale has numbers listed in Celsius on the dial. The box to the straightener came closed and wrapped in plastic, but appeared dirty (finger prints and stains) on the inside. The acutal iron itself even looked dirty when it arrived, like the paint job wasn&#x27;t quite done right.  The Royale I had previously would heat up almost instantaneously, this once seemed to take longer. Also, it pulled my hair terribly when I attempted to straighten. I will likely return it.</li>
    <li> This iron is EXACTLY the same as the ones being sold at the mall kiosks for more than $150.  I was a gift for my daughter and she uses it every day.</li>
    <li> So I too was pulled out of the crowd at the mall by a foreign girl trying to sell my daughter and I this straightener. I really do hate these kiosk and avoid them at all costs, but my teenager daughter was won over. The lady used this flat iron on her hair and the steam that was produced was alot and her hair was beautiful and straight. Even looked healthy. However when I was told the iron normally sells for $300 but is on sale for $150 I immediately ushered my daughter out of the chair and on our way. We were school clothes shopping anyway and the money needed to go to those necessities instead. Then we find what appears to be the same flat iron on Amazon and we are estatic!! Only to find that it doesn&#x27;t work well at all. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to flatten the hair straight. There is no steam and it takes longer to straighten your hair. This thing is going back!!!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005C1HHSA Royale Classic Platinum Zebra Nano Ceramic Ionic Flat Iron / Hair Straightener Styler Dual Voltage 110v-240v]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product through Amazone for the dule voltage feature to use over seas.  I have not done so yet so not sure how it works in Europe.  I have used it in the US and am disappointed.  It does not heat as hot as the one I have been using.  So the jury is still out as to how it will fare over seas.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this iron at a mall for approx $100, she dropped it off of the counter and one of the plates broke. I found this one online and it is exactly what we bought for $100, much cheaper and it came with 2 hair clips as well. I love the Royale line and would recommend these irons to anyone. I have one of my own that does not have an adjustable temp like this one. Well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> My mom bought a straightener like this from the mall and it makes your hair feel really good. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much when I was buying this online, after all it is under half the price that my mom paid for it and I would say that I definitely got what I paid for--this straightener isn&#x27;t that great in quality, but it gets the job done. It works the way any other straightener should and it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> This product is great. My daughter wanted to buy one at the store kiosks but I was not intending to pay 300 dollars. I chose five stars because it&#x27;s a great product and has made my daughter so happy!</li>
    <li> Use it every week end</li>
    <li> I had a Royale flat iron I bought in a shopping center 2 years ago. Got broken and I order this in amazon. After 5 months stop working. Do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I did not like flat iron it was not like the one we saw in the mall. Its an imitation.</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing esp for the price.  So easy to curl hair with it even!  WOW!  Would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> After seeing the ones they sell at the mall i considered buying one through Amazon to get a better deal. I ordered the zebra blk n white Royale. I was very pleased with the flat iron considering it looks exactly like the ones from the mall but at a fourth of the price. It works really great on heating up and leaving my hair soft and manageable after using it. It also cuts down the time compared to using my other flat iron. However, i would love to love this item it has a tiny kink.. When pulling the flat iron down my hair it seems to get stuck in a corner of the plates and it hurts..I just have to remember this and not pull it through all the way. I would love to exchange it for another one and hopefully it won&#x27;t have the same issues. But i don&#x27;t have the money to send it back. :/</li>
    <li> We almost got it from mall which was pretty expensive.  Got it cheap from here loved it. Same product n same quality.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this after reading some previous reviews about the heat level but I found this to work great in Australia and the heat was very hot to straighten my longer hair.  But an adapter to fit the Australian receptacles and your good to go!</li>
