    <li> Cuts nearly as well as the pair of shears my mother paid a couple hundred for with her beautician job.  I&#x27;ll probably come back to this way down the road to let people know when it starts to get dull, don&#x27;t know how long they&#x27;ll last, but I&#x27;m very satisfied so far.&lt;br /&gt;. . . What the heck, you take the time out of your day to help someone and they just turn around and mark how &amp;#34;unhelpful&amp;#34; you are? I don&#x27;t get it. I don&#x27;t even know why I bother.  I come back after all this time to add onto my experience and I get this rudeness.</li>
    <li> Great scissors but really dull after a few trims</li>
    <li> fantastic, awhole lot better than expected</li>
    <li> Cutting performance is poor</li>
    <li> feels like regular scissors with toy jewelry on them. Doesn&#x27;t have the quality metal feeling when you hold it in your hand.  definitely overpriced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetology student and I must say, they cut really well. Good quality and they are beautiful! Great deal!</li>
    <li> Crazy sharp! I wish they weren&#x27;t pink, though, because my toddler is attracted to the design, but they are way too dangerous for her to touch.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shears thankyou</li>
    <li> Not a hair dresser or in the business. Just a mom trying to save the public the pain of hearing my child scream while getting his hair trimmed. This product works for that. Even cuts skin quite well....</li>
    <li> They arrived on time and the price was great.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is great for use in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they work great in my hands. Oh yes the color is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Loved the color, different, trying them out right now at work so far I like them. The price was right!</li>
    <li> The price is what drove my purchase...great quality for the cost. However, this set is not exactly as described.  There is a pink &amp;#34;stone&amp;#34; on the tightening nut - really only for those who love rainbows and pink!  I bought these for my straight son - not exactly a perfect fit!  The tools, themselves are top notch, small, VERY sharp.  The aesthetic was just off for us.</li>
    <li> These shears are AMAZING!! Soo obsessed with them!</li>
    <li> Very sharp and beautiful.</li>
    <li> Cheap scissors so they do the job but they Dull quickly</li>
    <li> Great product..came in a little dull, but an easy fix. Otherwise, I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
    <li> The sharpest scissors I have ever use!!</li>
    <li> Love them use them in a salon great quality!</li>
    <li> Recipient LOVES scissors. Plans to buy more. She is a barber and can&#x27;t believe the quality for price of the scissors. Not to mention how pretty they are. Likes the case for travel as well.</li>
    <li> I cut hair at home and not a professional but this shears were are so easy to use and very comfortable on your fingers and hand.</li>
    <li> Not only were these great scissors, but they were beautiful as well.. I gave them as a present and I couldn&#x27;t have chosen anything better.</li>
    <li> Need to say that these shears were a lot better than expected. Considering the price I paid… I made out on the deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a stylist so I didn&#x27;t know what to look for, but hey, it came with two pair. I don&#x27;t think these are super fantastic, but they are sharp and I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is being sawn through. They come with a heavy coating of I believe mineral oil, which hey, helps prevent rusting and wear and tear during storage. Overall, they aren&#x27;t bad and they are apparently comfortable to the person that cut my hair. I trimmed up the front and I&#x27;d say not bad at all.</li>
    <li> I just cut my own hair, so what do I know? These scissors are way better than the ones I was using, the ones that came with the Wahl clipper set I got years ago. The difference is they are sharp. I don&#x27;t really care that they are cute. My little girl thinks they are beautiful, but otherwise I don&#x27;t have to show them to anyone, so they are OK. After getting these, my beard is gone, because I kept trimming and trimming, until one day I had to just take the whole thing off. And my hair doesn&#x27;t grow beyond about an inch, for the same reason. I like my new scissors.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and these just don&#x27;t cut it! The scissors are pretty good as far as scissors go but the thinning shears are horrible. I have a friend who is a stylist and hair cut specialist who came to my home with her professional shears and cut my hair. Whatever you do don&#x27;t buy these expecting them to cut evenly either because the only portion of the thinning shears that cut as all at the beginning of the opening of the shears towards the handle, the rest of the shear does nothing!</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my wife who is a cosmetology student. She loved them and states that they cut like butter. Her old sheers where suppose to be extremely high quality that were issued by the school but within a month they dulled and got choppy. Once she got these she never complained and loves using these sheers every chance she gets.</li>
