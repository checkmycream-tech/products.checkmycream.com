      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>Beautiful colors and comfortable.</li>
      <li>I like them and they are nice quality, but before I ordered them I contacted Kenz Laurenz to ask if I could choose the colors</li>
      <li>Love love love these!!</li>
      <li>I have put them in the dyer with fabric sheets to try and get rid of the odor but its still very strong.</li>
      <li>The quality of the headbands appeared good, however I had to return them, as they wouldn&#x27;t fit over my head.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable headbands</li>
      <li>but some of them are tighter than others, for instance the gold one is looser and I like it better among this set because of it  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping and great communication.</li>
      <li>I then received a message saying that these were prepackaged and I wasn&#x27;t able to pick colors.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more for Christmas gifts.  </li>
      <li>thought these would stay in my hair better, they did not.</li>
      <li>I have a big head and lots of hair and these are AWESOME!</li>
      <li>I really love these ties.  </li>
      <li>They are okay</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are exactly what I wanted and this seller was friendly and had great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and they fit my head and can stretch to fit many sizes</li>
      <li>Super cute headbands.</li>
      <li>The products are amazing, the colors are so vibrant and the shipping was faster than ever!</li>
      <li>Very comfortable with just the right amount of strength to keep them in place.</li>
      <li>At only a $1 a headband, I was expecting a train wreck, but what I got was a super affordable and effective way of buying my favorite type of headband.  </li>
      <li>Also, I think it is true that they don&#x27;t leave a crease, but my hair is curly/wavy</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Very pretty and sturdy headbands.  </li>
      <li>but they just pop right off,</li>
      <li>i contacted the seller and they responded right away.</li>
      <li>They do stretch out a little but just wrap it one more time and voila, works just fine!</li>
      <li>This would probably work great for someone with a small head.</li>
      <li>I got these for my 10 year old daughter and her fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try putting hot glue on them to see if that helps..</li>
      <li>They really are no crease!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Ive even put hot glue on the inside to give it some grip, and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I  have tried this product in the past and loved it.</li>
      <li>Big enough to keep on my wrist when I want to let my hair down, they don&#x27;t pull or break my hair which is perfect!</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t squeeze your head like other elastics do, and they&#x27;re cute.</li>
      <li>I have super thick, coily hair, and I love these headbands because they do not cause dents</li>
      <li>Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t care about color choices since my giant curly hair would hide it anyway, but the colors were overall cute and girly.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an adult and wear a size XS in hats.</li>
      <li>but I got a decent assortment and have about 4 that I currently rotate.</li>
      <li>Pretty, but not as I expected...</li>
      <li>I have a slightly large head circumference (23&amp;#34;) but usually don&#x27;t have a problem finding hats, headbands, etc.</li>
      <li>Cheap and not very good quality.  </li>
      <li>Like major chemicals.</li>
      <li>Kenz Laurenz not only responded quickly to my request of asking for 8 black (and 2 colored ones for myself of course), but I received this order within 3 days of placing it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>These headbands are too tight for my head, and snap right off.</li>
      <li>I received them today and am not happy with many of the colors, Out of the 10, I received two browns and that is definitely not a color that I would ever choose!</li>

<li> EXTREMELY RECOMMEND PURCHASING THESE!</li>
<li> I needed headbands that wouldn&#x27;t be too tight and would still help with making my hair look less frizzy at the gym, so I ordered these.  </li>
<li> No to tight to give a headache.</li>
<li> The hair ties are nice in quality, however they smell terrible.</li>
<li> They were too small, so I gave them to my little cousin.</li>
<li> Too small</li>
<li> , I can&#x27;t usually tell if headbands leave a crease, so</li>
<li> and they have been either difficult to find or extreme expensive, plus he ONLY likes the plain black one.</li>
<li> No more ouch when I put my hair up!</li>
<li> I have thin hair</li>
<li> NOT HAPPY.</li>
<li> Not impressed.  </li>
<li> I will be returning my random pack of 10 as that is not what I intended to buy.</li>
<li> but for now they are just taking up space in a drawer :-(</li>
<li> Im very disappointed in these :(</li>

    <li> The products are amazing, the colors are so vibrant and the shipping was faster than ever! Thanks! I will probably be ordering one in EVERY color :D</li>
    <li> My daughters loved them.</li>
    <li> Colors are nice and bright. Perfect headbands for me. I have thin hair so I like the skinner headbands. No to tight to give a headache.</li>
    <li> They were just as expected. Very satisfied with colors and quality.</li>
    <li> They really are no crease!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Wish I could pick the colors but I got a decent assortment and have about 4 that I currently rotate.</li>
    <li> I  have tried this product in the past and loved it. i doesn&#x27;t leave a dent in my hair. When I ordered the product this time, there was an issue with shipping. i contacted the seller and they responded right away. they took care of the problem and I was very satisfied. great product, great customer service!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wear any of these because they slip off almost instantly. I&#x27;m going to try putting hot glue on them to see if that helps..but for now they are just taking up space in a drawer :-(</li>
    <li> Product arrived BEFORE expected delivery date! The headbands are a gift, so I am not aware of how well they work. 10 different colors, just like it says!</li>
    <li> I got these for my 10 year old daughter and her fine hair.  They work as described and she loves all the colors.</li>
    <li> The hair ties are nice in quality, however they smell terrible. Like major chemicals. I have put them in the dyer with fabric sheets to try and get rid of the odor but its still very strong.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t squeeze your head like other elastics do, and they&#x27;re cute. I&#x27;ve bought a set for myself and for my sister. Love these. And the price is affordable compared to the elastics you find at department stores.</li>
    <li> Love them! Big enough to keep on my wrist when I want to let my hair down, they don&#x27;t pull or break my hair which is perfect!</li>
    <li> AWESOME!  The rep from Kenz Laurenz was very nice and helpful when they contacted me.  I will be ordering more for Christmas gifts.  Very pretty and sturdy headbands.  And they seem to wash well.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable with just the right amount of strength to keep them in place. The package arrived within the estimated delivery window.</li>
    <li> I really love these ties.  My scalp doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore when my hair is up and they don&#x27;t get tangled and my hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled.  They do stretch out a little but just wrap it one more time and voila, works just fine!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, just what I wanted and in great colors!! I have a big head and lots of hair and these are AWESOME!</li>
    <li> These are great bands. They don&#x27;t crease or pull my hair. No more ouch when I put my hair up!</li>
    <li> Great product! Super cute headbands. Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The quality of the headbands appeared good, however I had to return them, as they wouldn&#x27;t fit over my head. I&#x27;m an adult and wear a size XS in hats. These are not for adults - they are for children.</li>
    <li> Love! Fit well beautiful colors! Great quality! Great customer service sent me exactly what I wanted!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty, but not as I expected... They were too small, so I gave them to my little cousin.</li>
    <li> Im very disappointed in these :( These are my second purchase from this company and both slip off my head after wearing for only a few minutes. Ive even put hot glue on the inside to give it some grip, and it doesn&#x27;t work. NOT HAPPY.</li>
    <li> thought these would stay in my hair better, they did not. So I just cut them to make them into pony tail holers</li>
    <li> I needed headbands that wouldn&#x27;t be too tight and would still help with making my hair look less frizzy at the gym, so I ordered these.  They are okay I guess, but some of them are tighter than others, for instance the gold one is looser and I like it better among this set because of it  Also, I think it is true that they don&#x27;t leave a crease, but my hair is curly/wavy, I can&#x27;t usually tell if headbands leave a crease, so I can&#x27;t speak to that with 100% confidence.  I wouldn&#x27;t order them again, I would try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wear them as a headband but they just pop right off, won&#x27;t stay in place, so they are basically an oversized scrunchie. Too small I guess. Not what I wanted at all. And no I don&#x27;t have an oversized head lol.</li>
    <li> I thought they were headbands but the where baby hair clips, gave to my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I like them and they are nice quality, but before I ordered them I contacted Kenz Laurenz to ask if I could choose the colors and they said yes and sent me a color list. I placed the order and then contacted Kenz Laurenz with the colors I wanted. I then received a message saying that these were prepackaged and I wasn&#x27;t able to pick colors. I received them today and am not happy with many of the colors, Out of the 10, I received two browns and that is definitely not a color that I would ever choose!</li>
    <li> Love love love these!! So awesome have a nice fit. The colors are great!! Would order again! Fast shipping and great communication. Very comfortable headbands and they fit my head and can stretch to fit many sizes</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves these headbands now that he has grown out his hair and they have been either difficult to find or extreme expensive, plus he ONLY likes the plain black one. Kenz Laurenz not only responded quickly to my request of asking for 8 black (and 2 colored ones for myself of course), but I received this order within 3 days of placing it!&lt;br /&gt;They are exactly what I wanted and this seller was friendly and had great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I EXTREMELY RECOMMEND PURCHASING THESE!</li>
    <li> At only a $1 a headband, I was expecting a train wreck, but what I got was a super affordable and effective way of buying my favorite type of headband.  I have super thick, coily hair, and I love these headbands because they do not cause dents, they don&#x27;t snag my curls, they&#x27;re so comfy that I sleep in them and I&#x27;ve yet to break one.  Gone are the days when I would try to stretch a headband over my head, only to have it snap in half from the stress!&lt;br /&gt;These arrived in about a week and I got an assortment of colors ranging from baby pink, to sparkly teal.  Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t care about color choices since my giant curly hair would hide it anyway, but the colors were overall cute and girly.&lt;br /&gt;For now on, I&#x27;m only buying these headbands from here.  I used to go the store, pay $5 for a three pack and pray to the hair accessory gods that I won&#x27;t lose them.  And after losing said headbands, I would go to store-to store, only to find that they are sold out. Hooray Amazon for saving the day!</li>
    <li> Cheap and not very good quality.  Not impressed.  Will work as pony tail holders only.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item which was for 10 headbands but showed 25. The seller stated you just had to e-mail them with what colors you wanted, which is what I did. However, I got an e-mail back stating that it was prepackaged and I couldn&#x27;t pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of this review, the item description still shows 25 colors with no indication of what 10 colors might be included in the package. I will be returning my random pack of 10 as that is not what I intended to buy.</li>
    <li> These stretch out with each use. You can re-knot them later if needs be. An improvement would be a no slip grip. I like that they have matte on one side and satin on the other.</li>
    <li> These headbands are too tight for my head, and snap right off. I have a slightly large head circumference (23&amp;#34;) but usually don&#x27;t have a problem finding hats, headbands, etc. This would probably work great for someone with a small head.</li>
