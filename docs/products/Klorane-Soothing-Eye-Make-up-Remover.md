      <li>/&gt;It is very gentle and does not irritate my eyes.  </li>
      <li>So glad to find it on Amazon, and I&#x27;m back to using this product rather than the higher priced brands that don&#x27;t seem to work as well from the department store cosmetic counters.  </li>
      <li>and the simple shower water does a better job moving my make-up around</li>
      <li>I used this product for years and only stopped because I was no longer able to find it where I live.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know that it doesn&#x27;t really remove waterproof makeup, so I feel like it was kind of a waste since I wear it almost all the time.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t wear that much makeup).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle</li>

      <li>My eyes are sensitive,  I like this, does a decent job too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> The pharmacy closed</li>

<li> And a little goes a long way, too.</li>
<li> Not worth it.  </li>
<li> down to Maybelline in years</li>
<li> Just a little product on a cotton ball or swab, hold it over the lashes for a moment, then VOILA...</li>
<li> I have trouble using eye makeup remove because of the oily residue which burns my eyes.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also not cheap.  </li>
<li> There is no strong scent or stinging sensation upon application.</li>
<li> I  opened one last night and thought perhaps it had gone bad because it looked like blue water.  </li>
<li> I have to try at least three times to fully get all of it off, and even then I feel like I need to use another remover to get what this one left behind.    </li>
<li> All color is removed from the upper lid, however the undereye area has a faint shadow.  </li>
<li> The bottle arrived dirty and I am skeptical as to whether it was actually refilled with a different product!</li>
<li> Overall, until I find another product that requires no prodding at all to remove ANY type/brand of eye make-up and eyeliner (might be a very difficult accomplishment)</li>
<li> I was shocked to find that the two bottles that I bought months ago were not the same product.  </li>
<li> have used since the 1980s, tried all the rest from expensive to drug store&lt;br /&gt;and</li>

<li> I am so disappointed with this make-up remover.  </li>
<li> Worst product ever!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I find that it removes eye makeup and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. But, that is what I expect of any eye makeup remover. I didn&#x27;t find that it cleans in one swipe. Rather, it takes 2-3 passes to get the makeup off, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate me so I don&#x27;t mind, really. I like the quantity for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and highly recommend it. It is not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. There is no strong scent or stinging sensation upon application. Will continue to use it for as long as it&#x27;s made.</li>
    <li> I started using this eye make-up remover years ago when i purchased it from an independent pharmacy.The pharmacy closed and I could never find this product which is better than any brand at any price anywhere. It is so gentle and takes away all eye make-up without smearing my contact lenses.</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover for super sensitive eyes.  Removes all eye makeup gently and thoroughly and leaves no oily residue.  Actually soothes skin around eyes.  Excellent price too. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> This product removes eye make-up and liner well, although some prodding was needed. It is non-irritating, gentle, and does NOT require rinsing afterwards. It is hypo allergenic, and my sensitive skin tolerates it very well.     Overall, until I find another product that requires no prodding at all to remove ANY type/brand of eye make-up and eyeliner (might be a very difficult accomplishment) I&#x27;ll stick with this Klorane product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle so it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eyes, it smells great and it works well. I wear quite a bit of mascara and mac eyeliner and have no problem getting it off.  My favorite remover and I have tried many.  I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used.  There is no residual oil; I use a soft cotton square to apply Klorane; and unlike other \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; makeup removers, this does not irritate my eyes.  And a little goes a long way, too.</li>
    <li> Awesome eye makeup remover.  Very gentle on the eyes.  Great for contact lens wearers as well.  Definitely worth seeking out online!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this remover, so I purchased it.  It still requires more rubbing and scrubbing than I want in the eye area.  (wrinkles!!!)  All color is removed from the upper lid, however the undereye area has a faint shadow.  The shadow is better than many others I have tried, but I have to use concealer and foundation over it, even when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup.  This product doesn&#x27;t sting, burn or feel oily.</li>
    <li> Worst product ever! Does not remove eye make up. Smells weird. Is blue, which seems unnatural.</li>
    <li> I have trouble using eye makeup remove because of the oily residue which burns my eyes. This remover, however, removes my eye makeup so easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue! I would recommend this to anyone who has sensitive eyes plus everyone else.</li>
    <li> have used since the 1980s, tried all the rest from expensive to drug store&lt;br /&gt;and this is natural and removes mascara, kohls, liquid liners, and shadows without fail.&lt;br /&gt;(use Lancome mascara, all the rest is MAC, but it has worked for me from Chanel&lt;br /&gt;products down to Maybelline in years past)&lt;br /&gt;it will tackle waterproofs in 2 applications, but klorance also has a waterproof&lt;br /&gt;remover than does it in one.</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover is mild and non-oily.  It cleans gently without leaving residue. It works well even on super thick mascara.</li>
    <li> Been using this for many, many years.  It is the only eye makeup remover I would ever considering using.  The price is right and it never burns.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now.  I love it!  I have tried both cheap and expensive mascara removers.  This product is the BEST!  It does NOT irritate my eyes or make them puffy.  Just a little product on a cotton ball or swab, hold it over the lashes for a moment, then VOILA...the mascara comes right off.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different removers over the years, and found this to be my favorite one...it is non-irritating and completely removed the eye make-up. The fragrance is wonderful too!</li>
    <li> I used to love this product until I started wearing waterproof mascara.  I didn&#x27;t know that it doesn&#x27;t really remove waterproof makeup, so I feel like it was kind of a waste since I wear it almost all the time. Tonight I was so thrilled when my mascara came off so easily.  I thought it was because I was holding the pad on my eye to let the remover &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; in.  Then I remembered I was wearing regular mascara and got bummed out again. If you don&#x27;t use waterproof makeup then this stuff is the bomb. No stinging or residue.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 16 years. Have on occasion tried another brand of eye make up remover but none compare to this one. It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
    <li> Gentle and effective this is the best eye makeup remover out there.&lt;br /&gt;I order this regularly .  I will use nothing else.</li>
    <li> My eyes are sensitive,  I like this, does a decent job too.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every product from a drugstore, Mary Kay, sephora brand,....(I won&#x27;t spend more than $20, so not sure of expensive brands).  This is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Still irritates my eyes</li>
    <li> Repeat buyer. Seems to be the only remover that does the job and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> Klorane used to put out an eye makeup remover in white lotion form.  It was easy to use and really did the job on my long wear mascara. I didn&#x27;t have to tug at the eye area and the lotion did not burn my eyes.  I was shocked to find that the two bottles that I bought months ago were not the same product.  I  opened one last night and thought perhaps it had gone bad because it looked like blue water.  I threw it away and opened the second bottle. I was surprised to find that it looked the same so I tried it out. It stung my eyes so severely I had to stop and rinse them out with eye drops.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot understand why there was no warning that this was a new formulation when I first purchased what I thought was the original white lotion.  Why the change for the worse?!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000A3ZMPA Klorane Soothing Eye Make-up Remover with Cornflower - 6.7 fl oz]]</li>
    <li> not too harsh on sensitive eyes.  No oily residue, I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I used this product for years and only stopped because I was no longer able to find it where I live.  Once I discovered it on Amazon, I ordered two bottles and will continue to purchase it as long as it is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very gentle and does not irritate my eyes.  It does not work as well as I wanted it to on waterproof mascara, but my next order will include the Klorane product designed specifically for waterproof mascara, if they still sell it.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed with this make-up remover.  I have tried letting it sit on my eyes for several minutes and still I cannot get anything loose (and I don&#x27;t wear that much makeup).  I use it to take my make-up off before a shower and end up having to scrub- and the simple shower water does a better job moving my make-up around and I have raccoon eyes when I get out of the shower.  Then i have to scrub my face again with this stuff for a while before having a clean face.  Not worth it.  I like that it&#x27;s natural and it smells nice but it burns my eyes and doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It&#x27;s also not cheap.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> While it is gentle and there is no residual oil, it takes a little bit of work to get the make-up off.  I use MAC eye liner, and this particular remover does a poor job of taking it all off.  It even has a hard time getting normal eye shadow off completely.  I have to try at least three times to fully get all of it off, and even then I feel like I need to use another remover to get what this one left behind.    Maybe it only works well for certain eye make-ups, but it certainly does not work on mine.</li>
    <li> it works perfectly, it does not sting, and, it removes eye make up quickly. I have used it for years</li>
    <li> I happily used this product for many years, then could not find it locally for a while.  Then our local Walgreens started carrying it and I was happily buying it up regularly.  I was dismayed when I went back to the store to buy another bottle and they no longer carry it.  So glad to find it on Amazon, and I&#x27;m back to using this product rather than the higher priced brands that don&#x27;t seem to work as well from the department store cosmetic counters.  I find it very gentle, yet effective without stinging my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It removes certain stubborn mascara where other removers do not. Klorane removes ALL the mascara and makeup, not just most of it. I cannot say how it works on waterproof mascara as I use Lancome or Loreal regular mascaras, but I can say it is an excellent cleaner without being harsh on the skin or eyes.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived dirty and I am skeptical as to whether it was actually refilled with a different product!</li>
    <li> wonderfull eye make up remover  it conditions and and refreshes the eye area i really recommend this product i love it</li>
