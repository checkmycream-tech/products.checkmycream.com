      <li>this luxurious shampoo is worth every penny !!!  </li>
      <li>Did ok nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>And over conditioned fine hair is not volumizing!</li>
      <li>What a perfect shampoo I wash and blow dry every day and find this is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is lovely too.</li>
      <li>I wanted something luxurious for my hair to look healthy and voluminous, so I got this shampoo.</li>
      <li>but it was advertised at one price and when it arrived I was charged $ 10 more than the price listed on Amazon.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>and like it much better.</li>

      <li>This shampoo gives me great body and my hair looks so much healthier.  </li>
      <li>Really love this shampoo, use it every day.</li>
      <li>Wow -- what a difference (and not in a good way!).  </li>
      <li>Worth the money!!</li>
      <li>I love the Oribe line and was excited to try this.</li>
      <li>I have fine and oily hair, so I wash it 5 times a week.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m always looking for the next great product.</li>
      <li>Fantastic shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice shampoo and it smells fantastic and really feels luxurious in your hair.  </li>
      <li>A couple of times per week I use a more hydrating conditioner with it (instead of the coordinating one) which I now can because it does such a good job of thickening my hair.</li>
      <li>Very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I found out that this shampoo really does help very fine hair and am now planning to supply my daughter also.</li>
      <li>Another special order for wife</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rich that you need just a little for a great shampoo</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly, but very fine.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend !!!</li>
      <li>Have fine, straight hair and really need products to help with volume and so am always in the hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>however it left my fine hair too conditioned and oily!</li>
      <li>I am willing to pay for a higher quality item if it delivers....</li>
      <li>I love Oribe hair products and have several items from this line.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It seemed to make my hair seem fuller from the first use.  </li>
      <li>I straighten it pretty much every day.  </li>
      <li>You can easily get the same results from a 10 dollar shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is the second bottle of this shampoo for me; I will continue to use this product for my fine, gray, curly hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling very clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it out like harsher grocery store brands.</li>
      <li>Seems to be very concentrated</li>
      <li>At $32 a pop, it&#x27;s a real PR hype.</li>
      <li>I have very fine black hair</li>
      <li>It smells OK, but it is not worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Love the shampoo, but when I received it, the bottle was packed upside down.  </li>
      <li>the total opposite of healthy.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the price is wayyyy too high to justify the results.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s too high ?</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Something you don&#x27;t normally get from salon brands.</li>
      <li>Needless to say that I did not notice ANY volume, and definitely anything magnificient.&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; things about this shampoois that it smells nice and comes in a nice bottle.</li>
      <li>I have fine limp hair and this really helps</li>
      <li>I bought the whole volumizing line and it left my hair very damaged looking.  </li>
      <li>Went back to my old organic Giovanni line and much happier!</li>
      <li>I first bought Oribe shampoo at my salon several years ago, and it was much more expensive there than it is here at Amazon.</li>
      <li>It is a bit expensive but you only need a tiny bit to really get a nice shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely not for frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I had to use it a few times to get it right.</li>
      <li>I loved it then, but it was just too expensive!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also helps with volume and styling when your hair is fine and thin.</li>
      <li>If you have fine, thin hair</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine, straight, limp hair</li>
      <li>My sister swears by this for her thin hair, says it make a huge difference.</li>

<li> so it does last a long time which offsets the price.  </li>
<li> The only volume here is in the money spent for this product.</li>
<li> It also left my hair feeling dry and rough.</li>
<li> My hair dresser suggested this shampoo and while the price tag deterred me for a few months, once I finally caved I haven&#x27;t looked back.  </li>
<li> Not sure it is worth the price since I&#x27;m not sure it does a lot to add volume to my hair.</li>

<li> It is expensive and I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t know if I will purchase it again due to the price...</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair except maybe dry it out a little.</li>

<li> Other than that, I would recommend to avoid it, unless you will use it maybe once a week or less.</li>
<li> I think my poor old hair deserves.</li>
<li> wish I could return because I spent almost 200.00 , but you don&#x27;t know what junk you are getting until you use it a few times..  </li>
<li> With reduced sulfates for less color stripping.  </li>
<li> Keeps my hair c,saner less oily.</li>
<li> I used this with the corresponding conditioner and while it didnt yield ridiculous results (though I have yet to find a shampoo that does), it was definitely noticeable after a few weeks.</li>
<li> The price is a little steep for my budget</li>
<li> Not worth the price!</li>
<li> but of course I&#x27;ve used the product a few times, so that&#x27;s not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not worth the price! My salon raves about their products and I don&#x27;t get the hype. Used for several days and it&#x27;s drying my hair out terribly. Will be going back to my purology soon.</li>
    <li> smells good, lathers nicely, I have been using Oribe products for some time and they are one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I wanted something luxurious for my hair to look healthy and voluminous, so I got this shampoo. I have fine and oily hair, so I wash it 5 times a week. After 2 weeks with this shampoo my har started looking over-dried, brittle, rough... the total opposite of healthy. Needless to say that I did not notice ANY volume, and definitely anything magnificient.&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; things about this shampoois that it smells nice and comes in a nice bottle. Other than that, I would recommend to avoid it, unless you will use it maybe once a week or less. This is definitely not for frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the moisture conditioner and the volume foam and these also do not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> Now THIS stuff..it&#x27;s magic. I first bought Oribe shampoo at my salon several years ago, and it was much more expensive there than it is here at Amazon. I loved it then, but it was just too expensive! I tried through the years to find inexpensive shampoos that worked as well as this one, and either my hair is addicted to expensive shampoo, or else, there is no other regular grocery store shampoo that can hold a candle to this stuff. The fragrance is wonderful, but that&#x27;s not why I buy it. I buy it because it works, and it works better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves my hair feeling very clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it out like harsher grocery store brands. I love the way my hair looks and feels after I wash it with this shampoo, and I will continue to buy it, even if it puts me in the poor house! A little goes a long way, and although I wish it was less expensive, it is a luxury I think my poor old hair deserves. Highly recommended. The Oribe Signature shampoo is also great.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser suggested this shampoo and while the price tag deterred me for a few months, once I finally caved I haven&#x27;t looked back.  My hair is naturally curly, but very fine.  I straighten it pretty much every day.  Other shampoos often left my hair a little frizzy and limp.  This shampoo gives me great body and my hair looks so much healthier.  Recently I forgot it when I went out of town and used the hotel&#x27;s shampoo instead.  Wow -- what a difference (and not in a good way!).  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Not better than my L&#x27;oreal thicking shampoo..big difference in price.Did ok nice fragrance. Wish it was cheaper would use again.</li>
    <li> price too expensive. I will not buy anymore.</li>
    <li> this tiny bit of shampoo in your hand, makes lots of suds and cleans so well.&lt;br /&gt;It also helps with volume and styling when your hair is fine and thin.</li>
    <li> Another special order for wife</li>
    <li> Really love this shampoo, use it every day.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo that smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, but when I received it, the bottle was packed upside down.  This tells me that i t may have spreads been opened .</li>
    <li> My sister swears by this for her thin hair, says it make a huge difference. I may try it soon</li>
    <li> I was hoping to give this product a good review, however, I cannot recommend it for adding volume to your hair. I have used it for a month and I cannot tell any difference in my hair. It smells OK, but it is not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for about 20 days. I had terrible hair fall with its use. Had to discontinue immediately</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. I have very fine black hair so I tried this to get some volume. I used this with the corresponding conditioner and while it didnt yield ridiculous results (though I have yet to find a shampoo that does), it was definitely noticeable after a few weeks. HOWEVER, the price is wayyyy too high to justify the results. You can easily get the same results from a 10 dollar shampoo/conditioner. I&#x27;d say skip this and look elsewhere</li>
    <li> The price is a little steep for my budget but when it&#x27;s a good product ? ? ? What&#x27;s too high ?&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to make my hair seem fuller from the first use.  And now after four shampoos I&#x27;m still pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I think I had read a review in a health type magazine so felt a little reassured that it wasn&#x27;t just a commercial puff piece.</li>
    <li> So disappointing! I am willing to pay for a higher quality item if it delivers....however it left my fine hair too conditioned and oily! Which I do not or had a problem with that until using this product. And over conditioned fine hair is not volumizing!</li>
    <li> I love Oribe hair products and have several items from this line. However, i do not like this voluminizing shampoo because it STRIPS THE COLOR FROM YOUR HAIR (If you have highlights or otherwise color your hair). It also left my hair feeling dry and rough. It does seem to puff out your hair&#x27;s cuticle, so it does provide volume when blow drying your hair, however, there is a cost. I bought the color-safe Oribe shampoo and conditioner instead and like it much better.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice shampoo and it smells fantastic and really feels luxurious in your hair.  It is a bit expensive but you only need a tiny bit to really get a nice shampoo.  Don&#x27;t know if I will purchase it again due to the price...but it is a nice product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo. Lathers beautifully and leaves the hair clean and supple with a lot of body. Smells nice without being obtrusive. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this brand. I use a lot of their products. Keeps my hair c,saner less oily. Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I use this shampoo.  I have tried many volumizing formulas and have found this to be the best.  Alterna quit making the Life formula that I loved.  Very faint fragrance it has watermelon and lychee. With reduced sulfates for less color stripping.  Seems to be very concentrated so it does last a long time which offsets the price.  I cannot be without this shampoo.  A couple of times per week I use a more hydrating conditioner with it (instead of the coordinating one) which I now can because it does such a good job of thickening my hair.</li>
    <li> If you have fine, thin hair this luxurious shampoo is worth every penny !!!  It&#x27;s so rich that you need just a little for a great shampoo and I&#x27;m addicted to these products.  Highly recommend !!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Oribe magnificent volume shampoo.  I have fine limp hair and this really helps</li>
    <li> This is not a genuine Oribe product, beware.</li>
    <li> Have fine, straight hair and really need products to help with volume and so am always in the hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product not only does not give volume, it&#x27;s making my hair limper and duller. At $32 a pop, it&#x27;s a real PR hype. Would return it if I could but of course I&#x27;ve used the product a few times, so that&#x27;s not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oribe is all attitude and no substance!</li>
    <li> I love the Oribe line and was excited to try this. It is expensive and I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price. I had to use it a few times to get it right. It does give nice volume. But nothing amazing. The scent is nice though. Something you don&#x27;t normally get from salon brands. Very fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! I bought the whole volumizing line and it left my hair very damaged looking.  I was SO disappointed in these products - wish I could return because I spent almost 200.00 , but you don&#x27;t know what junk you are getting until you use it a few times..  I don&#x27;t know if this site is selling fake product or the Oribe line is just really that bad!  Went back to my old organic Giovanni line and much happier!</li>
    <li> I liked the shampoo gives me volume which is what I was looking for, smells nice although it is pricey</li>
    <li> No volumizing.  At this price, a major disappointment .  This was recommended in the WSJ so a double disillusion.&lt;br /&gt;Who can you trust?</li>
    <li> The only volume here is in the money spent for this product. I have thin, fine, straight, limp hair and I&#x27;m always looking for the next great product. This is not it. Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair except maybe dry it out a little. Did nothing for the volume.</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo but it was advertised at one price and when it arrived I was charged $ 10 more than the price listed on Amazon.</li>
    <li> What a perfect shampoo I wash and blow dry every day and find this is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. The fragrance is lovely too. Sandy lewis</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful; the cleanliness of the hair is excellent; the volume is terrific.  This is the second bottle of this shampoo for me; I will continue to use this product for my fine, gray, curly hair.</li>
    <li> I found out that this shampoo really does help very fine hair and am now planning to supply my daughter also.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great and lathers well.  Not sure it is worth the price since I&#x27;m not sure it does a lot to add volume to my hair.</li>
