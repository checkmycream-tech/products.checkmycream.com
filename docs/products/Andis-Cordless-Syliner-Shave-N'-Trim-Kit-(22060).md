      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>so I was glad to go for the cheaper option.</li>

      <li>glad its not a rechargeable unit.  </li>
      <li>it worked but at 19 i didnt comprehend upkeep and cleaning and moved on to the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get a top of the line trimmer at this price point</li>
      <li>Overall I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
      <li>I have been using my Andis hair clippers on the 0 attachment but was looking for something with a bit more maneuverability on my face.</li>
      <li>Yeah :)</li>
      <li>and now i know for sure</li>
      <li>The shaver was well received by my son he really liked it and uses every time he shaves thank u for a good product and fast delivery.[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>But for edging/trimming, or if your hair is fine, and you need something simple, mostly-disposable, and compact for travel, this is the best.</li>
      <li>arrived on time and I like the concept of batteries I can easily get and replace as opposed to the charging type that you have to throw away once a year or more.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not going to shave your face super clean like you see in the gillette commercials but your face will feel good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to manuever and buzzes my hair without any issues.</li>
      <li>so I could easily maintaine the shaved side of my head</li>
      <li>works fine but does not trim as close as I would like.</li>
      <li>shave (smooth but ouch)&lt;br</li>
      <li>i had great results after only 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>wont give you a smooth shave</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;ll give you what need to look smooth and stay bump free.&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I bought the original one to keep my beard and sideburns trimmed.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not terribly powerful -- if you have thick hair, maybe not the best choice.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve shaved my mug many ways with many different tools and with all those tools my goal was to get as smooth as possible and bump free.</li>
      <li>no i always had the right tool for the job</li>
      <li>The first one did everything that I wanted it to do trimmed my mustache, beard and around my ears and neck also touch up my hair.</li>
      <li>Trust me, it can get really hot.</li>
      <li>i could&#x27;ve just stuck with the first tool and never asked questions, but i was on a quest</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still searching for a good trimmer (the ones I&#x27;ve had are now dead!).</li>
      <li>Very please with the product.</li>
      <li>With no attachment it doesn&#x27;t shave very close</li>
      <li>then I know it isn&#x27;t very well made.</li>
      <li>The old one finally broke after one too many drops.  </li>
      <li>You might need a more heavy duty one if you are going to use it every day.</li>
      <li>Instead of fixing it replace it with a new trimmer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering a new again hopefully that will work longer.</li>
      <li>I would rate it 3/5 because it is easy to use and less noisy.</li>
      <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t shave close - of course, this may not matter to those who simply want it for beard trimming.</li>
      <li>Nice starter or if you have a small amount of facial hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again i tried every way possible to shave except straight razor:&lt;br /&gt;Mac</li>
      <li>the low price however also means the build quality won&#x27;t be much to brag about.</li>
      <li>Because of sensitive skin (I get a rash when I use a razor or electric shaver) and ingrown hair, I use beard trimmers to shave.  </li>
      <li>but I was pleasantly surprised it wasn&#x27;t a total junk.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought several of this model from military PXes, as they&#x27;re cheap, run on standard AA batteries (and thus don&#x27;t need a bulky charger), and when they break, you just throw them away and get another -- which happens every few years, but damage in transit or loss is just as likely.&lt;br</li>

    <li> Nice starter or if you have a small amount of facial hair.</li>
    <li> Works great for me but I see that it has limited capabilities compared to other products of the same type but it costs half of price</li>
    <li> All I can say is you get what you pay for. I have a somewhat coarse beard and the battery was half dead by the time I finished...I am unimpressed. Keeping it as a backup trimmer incase my dying conair finally kicks the bucket.</li>
    <li> Product is great. I had one already &amp; broke it so I found it here at Amazon. Yeah :)</li>
    <li> Use this for the beard and it works.  Happy with the purchase. glad its not a rechargeable unit.  Prefer putting batteries in.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for use as a shaver. Because of sensitive skin (I get a rash when I use a razor or electric shaver) and ingrown hair, I use beard trimmers to shave.  I found three problems with it. First, it doesn&#x27;t shave close - of course, this may not matter to those who simply want it for beard trimming. But also, it has little power. It really has a tough time with stubble even a few days old. Finally, the battery contacts keep coming loose - I have to open the battery compartment to adjust them.  I&#x27;m still searching for a good trimmer (the ones I&#x27;ve had are now dead!).</li>
    <li> It is an OK product, It says 5 speed but I couldn&#x27;t figure out where the other 4 speeds are! I would rate it 3/5 because it is easy to use and less noisy.</li>
    <li> This is my second trimmer. The first one did everything that I wanted it to do trimmed my mustache, beard and around my ears and neck also touch up my hair. Had it for about ten years. Something with the switch broke not a hundred percent sure. Instead of fixing it replace it with a new trimmer. Very please with the product. I use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> FOr the money this was great. I did not want 20 attachments lying around.  There are plenty of adjustements on this and everything sits nicely in the stand.  Would by again</li>
    <li> Was just looking for a trimmer to trim back my relatively short beard. I have been using my Andis hair clippers on the 0 attachment but was looking for something with a bit more maneuverability on my face. Got this and even the lowest setting didn&#x27;t even come close to being short enough. It&#x27;s not as if I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow...it&#x27;s definitely a beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for at least six years and have never had any problems with it. It needs to be cleaned and lubed occassionally to run well but other then that it&#x27;s great. I think the other user must have misread the description, there are 5 settings for the comb height, not 5 speeds. It is a good product for my needs. You might need a more heavy duty one if you are going to use it every day.</li>
    <li> The shaver was well received by my son he really liked it and uses every time he shaves thank u for a good product and fast delivery.[[ASIN:B0009XH6OQ Andis 22060 Cordless Styliner Shave &#x27;N Trim Kit]]</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get a top of the line trimmer at this price point but I was pleasantly surprised it wasn&#x27;t a total junk. All I can say is it does the job. I&#x27;m Asian and out hair is thicker than if you are of European descent but it does the job for me. I tried running it on alkaline but the battery life was  horrendous. On a pair of Sanyo Enerloops run time was much better. With no attachment it doesn&#x27;t shave very close but it isn&#x27;t an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the low price however also means the build quality won&#x27;t be much to brag about. Every time I buy a piece of electronic I do a squeeze test. If I squeeze and I can feel the plastic flex or I can hear creaking sounds then I know it isn&#x27;t very well made. Yes, it creaks so I won&#x27;t expect it to survive a fall on tiled floor. The attachments are a joke but I don&#x27;t need them anyway since the only place it&#x27;ll be used is below the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a good charger I can fully charge  a pair of Enerloops in 2 hours. I thought of investing in lithium powered trimmers but ALL of them have battery issues and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m spending on another NiCad powered trimmer trimmers as they&#x27;re take tak way too long to charge. Oh, if you have never used a trimmer before do keep the blade lubricated. The battery life improves when the blade wastes less power on friction and heat. Trust me, it can get really hot.</li>
    <li> Bought as a replacement for one I have had for 10+ years.  Does everything I need to keep my beard trimmed</li>
    <li> arrived on time and I like the concept of batteries I can easily get and replace as opposed to the charging type that you have to throw away once a year or more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lady with a side shave. I bought this so I could easily maintaine the shaved side of my head and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s easy to manuever and buzzes my hair without any issues. I love the adjustable gaurd. The stand it comes with it very weak feeling, but it holds everything so I have no issues with it. Overall I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I use trimmers to shave my head.  I&#x27;ve bought several of this model from military PXes, as they&#x27;re cheap, run on standard AA batteries (and thus don&#x27;t need a bulky charger), and when they break, you just throw them away and get another -- which happens every few years, but damage in transit or loss is just as likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have corded trimmers at home, and just bought a more expensive wet-dry rechargeable in Japan since I didn&#x27;t have any other option at the time, I&#x27;ve ordered another one of these for future travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not terribly powerful -- if you have thick hair, maybe not the best choice.  But for edging/trimming, or if your hair is fine, and you need something simple, mostly-disposable, and compact for travel, this is the best.</li>
    <li> It does not trim my beard as well as my last similarly priced trimmer. I think it was a Remington.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit to replace one that I&#x27;ve had for 9 years and bought locally.  The old one finally broke after one too many drops.  I bought the original one to keep my beard and sideburns trimmed.  I no longer have the beard but I still use it on my sideburns and eyebrows.  I also use it to trim around my ears after my wife gives me a haircut.  I haven&#x27;t used it as a shaver but for trimming it works great.</li>
    <li> Always remember that if you&#x27;re transitioning from Manual razor to Electric Razor or Shaver to give it time. the 1st time out of the box you shouldnt writing a review of how awful it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve shaved my mug many ways with many different tools and with all those tools my goal was to get as smooth as possible and bump free. as a black man i struggled for the last 13 years and being in the military it was obvious. i remembered back to basic training when they sent me to a shaving class and recommended i use a shaver similar to this. it worked but at 19 i didnt comprehend upkeep and cleaning and moved on to the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again i tried every way possible to shave except straight razor:&lt;br /&gt;Mac 3 (okay)&lt;br /&gt;Fusion (good and bad)&lt;br /&gt;hair clippers (nope)&lt;br /&gt;majic shave (smooth but ouch)&lt;br /&gt;double edge safety razor (tough but good)&lt;br /&gt;braun series 7 (yes the big dog)&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve even tried laser hair removal  (nothing is permanent and at that price! come on man)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as you can see i&#x27;ve purchased and tried many ways. but then i remember back to basic training and i remember that little trimmer/shaver they gave me and the words they said &amp;#34;this wont give you a smooth shave but it&#x27;ll give you what need to look smooth and stay bump free.&amp;#34; that&#x27;s all i&#x27;ve ever wanted and now i have it. yeah i could&#x27;ve just stuck with the first tool and never asked questions, but i was on a quest little did i no i always had the right tool for the job and now i know for sure what works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this to those who suffer from bumps (ingrown hairs). it&#x27;s not going to shave your face super clean like you see in the gillette commercials but your face will feel good. I use Lectric Shave with it, wash my face afterwards and moisturize my face afterwards. i had great results after only 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> It worked for a couple months and then stopped. Though, I was satisfy about the quality and the way the shaver works. I&#x27;m ordering a new again hopefully that will work longer.</li>
    <li> I got this item on December 20, 2014 and the blade just broke and I can&#x27;t see where I can get another of the removable blade this one has so until I find one this, in essence, is a glorified disposable electronic shaver.  When the product was working it was doing everything as I expected it to do so I was glad to go for the cheaper option. I saw that I did not need to use the &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; that lets you graduate the size of the shave since I don&#x27;t like to grow my beard. It was good but I had to use the trimmer once every four days or so.. annoying since I could go for a week when I used traditional razors, but expected given the fact that electronic shaves don&#x27;t go as close to the skin as traditional razors go.</li>
    <li> works fine but does not trim as close as I would like.</li>
