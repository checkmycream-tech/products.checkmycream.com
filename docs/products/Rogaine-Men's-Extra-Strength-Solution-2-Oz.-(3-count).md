      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>SMOOTH TRANSACTION, HAPPY CUSTOMER.</li>
      <li>Amazing .</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t care if you listen to me or not.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, just that it didn&#x27;t work for my type of hair loss.</li>
      <li>The bottles came sealed and it even came with it&#x27;s own 1mL dripper which has a screw on lid</li>
      <li>This product absolutely save my hair , best price in the market</li>
      <li>and this one has more solution percent wise in it.</li>
      <li>awesome have been using it and have seen real results</li>
      <li>Good deal and seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>way more effective than the foam was.</li>
      <li>it did not bother me, I was still able to have the nice wave.</li>
      <li>In my case, by my own observation it was better than what is pictured for the product, so I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It would have been nice, if the instructions had not been misleading and I&#x27;m sure others would appreciate if the seller would correct this .</li>
      <li>A couple months after I started using it, I experienced some hair growth right under my eyes at the top of my cheek bones.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and works very well!</li>
      <li>Not a problem since it&#x27;s just an additional spot to shave in the morning, and may even be welcome if you are interested in fulfilling your human/werewolf fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was pretty happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever lose my beautiful head of hair, but it&#x27;s going fast.</li>
      <li>I used this product on certain areas of my beard that were not as full as the rest, and it worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>I have more headache</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really satisfied with the result.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product works better in the beginning hair loss stage.</li>
      <li>The crown area is also showing improvements, there are no uncovered bald spots any more.</li>
      <li>Ended up adding more hair loss...</li>
      <li>I do end up using more product with the liquid though.</li>
      <li>After 3 more months if the improvement continues I would give this product 5 stars.</li>
      <li>My husband uses Rogaine for over 5 years now and the hair on top and now in the front is holding and not continuing to fall out.  </li>
      <li>Way better than the Costco</li>
      <li>It is better to take Biotin, and it works better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
      <li>I am quite pleased with the difference it has made.</li>
      <li>but I am confident</li>
      <li>I was hopeful about the temples, grateful for the thickening on top, but the product does state that it works on the vertex.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>The foam is better, this stuff is too runny.</li>
      <li>So I will give it more time.</li>
      <li>Hairline was trash, like a landing strip on top of my head trash.</li>
      <li>HAIRS.I GOT BETTER RESULTS BY STOP USING</li>
      <li>itchy and loss more hair.</li>
      <li>I have read on a bunch of thinning hair forum websites from some mega nerds (those guys that just obsess about factoids whom I love and appreciate)</li>
      <li>Whatever hair I have on the top of my head</li>
      <li>After 6 months, just caused more shedding than anything.  </li>
      <li>This formula works way better then the foam.</li>
      <li>So Rogaine is better than nothing in a manner of speaking.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m not going to spend more on it.</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for years and have always been pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>And I was so amazed and glad to see that</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin doctor recommended it. It seems to be working, and it is pricey. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Thanks. It really works.</li>
    <li> A regularly buy it for my friend. He has some hair issues and says Rogaine helps him a lot. This is all I know.</li>
    <li> I use twice a day as directed. I have seen good results, although not astounding...but enough to justify what I am paying for it. I stopped for a while and definitely noticed more hair loss. Started using it again, and three months later, see a bit more hair, and loss has ceased again. It certainly hasn&#x27;t given me a full head of hair, but I do believe it has kept me from losing much more, and grew a bit more at the crown.</li>
    <li> I enjoy my husband&#x27;s full head of hair! He faithfully uses the Extra Strength Original Unscented Rogaine morning and night, so his bald spot is not bald, but has real hair, which I cut every week, so I can attest to the fact that it is growing well.&lt;br /&gt;My son also uses this product, but is less faithful, so has less hair, but still some, although thinner. Excellent product if you care enough about your appearance to use it.</li>
    <li> Beware this is a sex drive killer. Prior to using Rogaine my sex life was great. Two month in I began noticing my sex drive declinan. It was as if I had no desire for sex and when we did have sex it took longer to get an erection. My erections were not the same quality that they used to be. I was chalking it up to getting older but it came on so quickly that I started to do some research. I just never made the connection between Rogaine and sex drive. Fortunately info on the net revealed many more cases like mine. I quit using the stuff about a week ago and I already feel myself slowly getting back to normal. My sex drive is returning. They don&#x27;t list this as a side effect on the bottle but the crap would be a lot harder to sell if they did.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 8 month.  I can see the hair grows in my part area.</li>
    <li> I START USING ROGAINE,NOT A SINGLE DIFERENCE IN ONE YEAR  EVEN I LOST MY ORIGINAL HAIRS.I GOT BETTER RESULTS BY STOP USING IT.A TOTALLY RIP OFF PEOPLE.</li>
    <li> I am Doctor of pharmacy who is using this product. I am suggesting to use it while taking 1mg Propercia tablet every day. The result will be gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years and have always been pleased with the results.  Great price for the seller.</li>
    <li> About ready to reorder</li>
    <li> I may not have used it long enough and I may be a bit past the  age for this product to be effective but I shaved my head and embraced the baldness! LOL!</li>
    <li> Stopped hair loss!! My doctor was surprised to see that my hair came back. However, as instructed, if you stop using it, you lose hair again... So I have to keep using it... The only bad side is that, the price is too expensive, compared to those generic brands. Hopefully it will go down a little bit in the near future.</li>
    <li> Great price and received it as promised.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my type of balding hair</li>
    <li> This is my fourth month of use (on my second pack). I saw results in my third month. It works but there are a few things to take note of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is not convenient to put on. It runs off as you apply and take time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. It seemed to cause fatigue when I started using it. I stopped using it during to day and I was no longer tired.&lt;br /&gt;3. It causes dandruff and it itches, a lot. I sometimes wake up at night scratching my head, literally. From the instructions, I am supposed to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;4. Leaves \\&quot;white\\&quot; patches in areas of application. These can wash off but are visible. This is minor though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be cheaper but you can get a $10 off coupon from their website. If it did not work, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought a second pack.</li>
    <li> It took less then 2 months to see that the hair my husband was loosing was coming back! This is a great product and works very well!</li>
    <li> For some time my hair had been thinning.  So I thought what the hell, I&#x27;ll give this a try and really did not have high hopes.  On the contrary, I kinda viewed it as snake oil but the price wasn&#x27;t too bad so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Prior to starting it I took pictures of my head which clearly showed much hair loss.  After the 3 month mark, the results were nothing less than spectacular.  I hate to sound like a commercial for Rogaine, but in my case it works very well indeed.  However, I&#x27;m also cognizant of the 15% who don&#x27;t have similar results.  I hadn&#x27;t seen my brother since Thanksgiving and he was amazed as well.  If you&#x27;re thinning and thinking about, my advice is go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JohnB</li>
    <li> After trial and error I had to stop using it. The itching after 30 days of use was more than a human could handle....bordered on torture!</li>
    <li> I love Romaine extra extra strength.  It may not make the hair grow, but it sure slows down the loss.</li>
    <li> GOOD, ITEM AS EXPECTED</li>
    <li> This s*** works, but don&#x27;t wait till your hair fall out.  Start using as soon as you see signs of thinning.  I tried one of the major drug company&#x27;s pill form and my libido dropped off , so screw that.</li>
    <li> My husband uses Rogaine for over 5 years now and the hair on top and now in the front is holding and not continuing to fall out.  It does make scalp itch though.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a greasy product, when you lose hair because of greasy hair you need your scalp to be clean not greasy besides scrachy. It doesnt give volume, new hair or regains the current one. Have been trying it for 6 months and eventhough they say it works, I dont see any results.</li>
    <li> Does not work the way we&#x27;d expect, instead you do grow tiny hair that can only be seen by a microscope, and it will end up falling quick to.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband. He used almost one month everyday night.&lt;br /&gt; I saw new hair is growing. Not much.. But I think it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I read up on this product and thought it was for regrowth on the hairline but i only realized after i bought it for a friend that this product is strictly for hair loss in the center of the head, so it didnt apply to us.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t start until well into my baldness so maybe i had a shot but i feel that while i used it it helped. alas my time has come to be a chrome dome</li>
    <li> i use this product for 1 month  it work  and i love  it . i will continue use this product this time  i will order 3 months supply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine since it was first introduced.  I have more hair today than I did back in 1989!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father&#x27;s father was bald when I was born.  My mother&#x27;s father had lost 1/2 his hair by the time he retired.  Not to mention that my mother lost so much hair after 50 that she was always wearing a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the recommended twice-a-day regimen, I use the included dropper to apply 1cc of \\&quot;extra-stength\\&quot; Rogaine only once, before bedtime.  The dropper lets me spread the liquid on my scalp without wetting my hair.  And each bottle lasts 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about what it costs for lunch at Burger King, you can keep your hair for another month.  Rogaine works!</li>
    <li> Like somebody else here I experienced the same symptom about my erections. I was only 24 years old and yes I got a lot of hair in a few months but noticed something was happening to my erections. I thought it was because of stress for too much work and school but after a little research about rogaine I discovered that some others rogaine users experienced the same. Now I&#x27;m getting bald again but my erections are back. Honestly, after such a bad experience I&#x27;m accepting myself in the way I look much better because I prefer to be a bald guy and make my wife happy when having sex than have a lot of hair but with weak or none erections at all. In conclusion, that was my experience everyone could have different symptoms or none just be careful and wise.</li>
    <li> Tried it for 8 months, twice a day as instructed. At best, I saw a very small area of thin peach fuzz in my crown that never really materialized much beyond that.</li>
    <li> the only and only one guaranteed solution for hair loss even for women, but the don&#x27;t stop it if you will you&#x27;ll get back to the first step.</li>
    <li> I have read that this only works on the crown of your head and this is a definite falsity. I am 31 and my hair was getting significantly thinner with age. I am used to having extremely thick hair, so this was a big blow.  It got to a point where I thought it was irreversible.  I read that rogaine only worked on the crown and that the pill solutions had MAJOR side effects.  So I thought, what the heck and gave it a go. I combined this with the Revivogen shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now sitting here typing this with a nice thick full head of hair. I do 1 1oz dropped (sometimes more if I over do it or get to much in my hair in 1 spot) in the morning and 1 before bed.  I shampoo exclusively with Revivogen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this over the foam because, A it makes sense that I would get more of the stuff on my scalp and less wasted in my hair and B I have read on a bunch of thinning hair forum websites from some mega nerds (those guys that just obsess about factoids whom I love and appreciate) that the alcohol irritates the scalp, which causes dandruff which INCREASES hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said. You will get dandruff or flaking of skin. You can use Nizoral if you are finding the itching and flaking to be to much. I just tough it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary. It works all over head. They only say crown because they originally got FDA approval on the crown and are not legally allowed to advertise it works on any other area. I ASSURE YOU IT DOES DONT WORRY!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the liquid not the foam. It works better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get Revivogen for your shampoo to cleanse your hair of that crap anti hair chemical during the day and night while your rogaine is fighting its battle as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get Nizoral for the itch and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a couple months. Just get into a routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not paid for these recommendations I honestly don&#x27;t care if you listen to me or not. But just do it and enjoy your hair and stop worrying ;)</li>
    <li> It seems fine. I like it.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described and does what it says it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I was using Women&#x27;s Rogaine, and my hair eventually started to fall out again after a year of use.  My doctor told me to start using the Extra Stength Rogaine and the hair loss has decreased dramatically.</li>
    <li> Not sure how much hair growth I am getting from it but use is limited by the fact that it makes your hair feel sticky.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
    <li> I used to be paying about $450 per month for s hair treatment which marginally worked. It included hair treatments, a laser comb, and monoxidil drops. I decided to stop paying so much and now for $30 I use rogain drops and they work just as well.</li>
    <li> its good  i always prefer this item. quality and price is well. i bought 6 more same bedore.  tganks for all</li>
    <li> great price. fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is not good for all users. I mean this could be working for people with less hair at vertex. i am using it since 2 months, but i didn&#x27;t see any development. i am loosing my hair in the front part of my head.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does exactly as it promises. My husband has used it for years. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> it works but for me its on and off i guess your diet and stress has something to do with hair too, not just heredity</li>
    <li> Rogaine and/or Amazon intentionally do not mention that this product is only for \\&quot;Vertex\\&quot; hair loss on the webpage. It won&#x27;t work on front at all. Even though it is mentioned in the product manual. But it will be way too late when you open the box and read the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot return the product due to the fact that it is \\&quot;hazard liquid\\&quot; :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my money just say \\&quot;bye bye\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, DO NOT buy if you are losing hair other than on your \\&quot;Vertex\\&quot;!!</li>
    <li> It works.  I believe strongly that the brand works better than the generic.  Have seen better results with the tried and true original.</li>
    <li> Now, the effect is not reflected, but little hair and no longer go on, it should be</li>
    <li> I have used topical rogaine for the last 4 months. I am 22 years old and suffered stress related hairloss on the top and crown of the head. After about 2 months of diligent use (as written on the bottle) I started seeing thicker hair and slow recovery of balding areas. There was two weeks where I couldn&#x27;t use it, but it did not seem to hinder the rate of regrowth too bad. Use generously. Even though too much won&#x27;t have additional effect, too little (&amp;lt;1-2ml/day) will not do much for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use the dropper they provided, you will apply it unevenly, it will get in your hair (AND DRY LEAVING FLAKES), and it can also come down on your face and neck. Here is a trick though: use an eye dropper bottle. I used a Cleareye eyedropper bottle to apply the topical solution, and none of the side effects I previously mentioned occurred. So you don&#x27;t need to dish out the extra cash for the foam version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the generic version and don&#x27;t notice the much difference. Maybe the side effects are more likely, but those can be avoided by using an eyedropper.</li>
    <li> Love the low price would buy again</li>
    <li> So far have been using Rogaine a month and have seen no change in my hair growth or loss. It does say it takes 3-4 months to see results. So I will give it more time.</li>
    <li> The product came early in the mail. I got exactly what I ordered. Very satified and would order from these people again.</li>
    <li> REALLY FAST SHIPPING, EXACTLY AS STATED, WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER. SMOOTH TRANSACTION, HAPPY CUSTOMER. BRAND NEW AS DESCRIBED.</li>
    <li> Although it specifically says not intended for women, I thought I would try and see if it could make my hair grow faster.  I used the product for about 3 months and really didn&#x27;t see any significant growth--I was using the Rogaine for Women prior to that--what started happening however was I started feeling very dizzy.  I researched the product online and found that this was one of the side effects so I stopped using it and the dizziness stopped.  Over the entire period of using both the women&#x27;s Rogaine and the men&#x27;s Rogaine, I really didn&#x27;t see any growth--even though I did meet the guidelines.  Maybe I just started too late.  However, I did want to warn women that side effects could occur with the stronger product and to think twice about using it.  That being said, I have been using the men&#x27;s product on my eyebrows and it does work--my sparse eyebrows are now fuzzy.  That is quite an achievement and since I don&#x27;t experience any side effects and only use it at bedtime, I will continue.  In time, I will probably return to the women&#x27;s strength but for the moment, will give my head a rest.</li>
    <li> This Rogaine superseded my expectations. This is  a great product!!!!</li>
    <li> Tried it for about four months. It seemed to have temporarily slowed the hair loss, but didn&#x27;t experience any growth.</li>
    <li> the stuff works but the fom is much easier to use, i didn&#x27;t pay enough attention to details, so if your ordering i would suggest the foam.</li>
    <li> keep using it... it works!  once you stop your hair you grew from using this starts slowing falling out.</li>
    <li> My wife used this after loosing most her hair from meds she was taking&lt;br /&gt;Her dermatologist recommended it even tho said for men&lt;br /&gt;Has  helped to get most her hair back</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only trusted solution for hair loss by now. I can see its results after three months. I hope I could find it cheaper. It&#x27;s vital to use it every day without any interrupt. Consult with your doctor before stop it. Sudden stop may cause worse hair loss.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does improve the hair density, I used both the drops and foam; the foam is much more convenient, as the drops run on my face!</li>
    <li> Too difficult to apply.  One could make a career out of application of this product.</li>
    <li> Using it for years and no new growth. Afraid to stop because it may be preserving the remaining hair left on my crown</li>
    <li> I used total of 6 bottls and didn&#x27;t see results. I wish if I can get my money back!</li>
    <li> Found out that Rogaine for Men works well for women...Instead of twice a day (for men) I put it on once a day at bedtime. I have seen my hair filling in from it... used about 8 months now.</li>
    <li> When i started losing my hair i was about 17 and for a girl  that&#x27;s  not ok. I knew my mom lost her hair in her thirties but that was due to getting pregnant. But i guess it was genetics we both share straight oily hair. Even my brother started to lose hair and he is only a year older. I was lost hope but did some research. To start off my hair recovery i dound this and bought it. Yes its for guys but i wanted it fast and this one has more solution percent wise in it. So since my hair was greasy i only did it once a day around my temples and front hairline and just a little to the back.results were not fast and people said it would take a while. So i put it on everyday once a day. For four months and i had started to see little hairs. So i kept going.during the process i did lose more hair but got new ones in its place they are about an inch now.i only truley know this cause i also dye my hair. And when i stopped using it my hair did fallout and lost growth so always have a new bottle on hand. I am still using and its pretty good u just got to be patient and wait for those little hairs to pop. I didnt notice a lot of extra hair growth on face it was average i do thread my eyebrows but thats normal. Sonetimes u will notice u have more dandruff  and i think its just the wet solution that dried up so dont scratch. I still have it today and it is a bother to do but so worth it if u want ur hair back.</li>
    <li> My dad uses rogaine and I can see the effect.</li>
    <li> Has worked out good, and much cheaper than in stores!</li>
    <li> Been using Rogaine extra strength for almost 10 years. Great product. Do not go with any generic...would you trust your hair loss issue with a generic? Go with the real deal from Amazon and get it to your door step in 2 days with Prime!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> good deal and shipping early than estimate time</li>
    <li> I purchased for my cousin and after three months of use, he may have just notices three new strands of hair. Not worth it !</li>
    <li> I like the product very much but you have to continue using it twice a day and that&#x27;s the difficult part of it!</li>
    <li> I am using this produc since 4 years ago and allways give perfect results, a im very happy and give mi good selfstim.</li>
    <li> Expensive and Still bald</li>
    <li> I ordered a 6 pack one thinking its foam. When i recieved it, its liquid and i did not like it. Later i found out this is actually awsome, because am using just 1ml in the morning and 1ml at night. In case of Rogaine foam, actually i wasted so much because its pumping type .Am using rogaine foam for 2 years and this for last one month, My thinning spot did not improve...but it did not get any bad.  I highly recommend this product from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Hairline was trash, like a landing strip on top of my head trash. Anyways about a year later and i&#x27;ve got basically all my hair back except for the areas near the temples (hair is now visible here too).</li>
    <li> Not just hair growth but also hair management.  Amazing product.</li>
    <li> Excelente Provider, excelente product.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it ^_^</li>
    <li> This product is working but you should not stop using It .</li>
    <li> Not for receding hair lines. Either that is not noted or was difficult to see. I didn&#x27;t notice that until I received it and it&#x27;s not returnable.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this all the time and really thinks it works. I am not sure but if it makes him happy he can have it.</li>
    <li> It works but I&#x27;ll be switching to the Kirkland brand to save money.  My other complaint is that it takes more than 1ml per application to cover all the balding areas; not just the crown.  Also, for those who don&#x27;t know, Rogaine and minoxidil in general can be used to regrow hair on other parts of the body like the beard or eyebrows.  I&#x27;m using it to grow my eyebrows out a bit as well as the hair on my head because I&#x27;ve always had very thin eyebrows whereas now they&#x27;re growing in nice and thick which has made me look more handsome.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know if this is working or not. I just keep thinking if I stop the hair will disappear faster.</li>
    <li> It is only used for hair loss treatment in the vertex of the head only and not used for the front of the head</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning, but now I have to say that my mane is like that of a horse!  I was afraid that my mullet would look dingy as I lost more from the top, and that eventually I&#x27;d have to go Euro and shave it all off.  Now with this product I&#x27;m back to being a sport, and the ladies are following me around as if I were a rich man offering vacations to warm places on his private jet.  And I don&#x27;t have any of those things.  I&#x27;m just a dude with awesome hair.</li>
    <li> I found this product has kept my hair growing, even though my two brothers are bald.  So, it does do something for me.</li>
    <li> I am 26 y.o. and from my father has very serious balding problems, he only has some hair left on the side of his head, above the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed the first signs when I was 23: first my temple and frontal line of my head started to move upwards very slowly. Then in the last 2 years my crown area has thickened and most of my hair fell off from the center of my vertex, leaving some areas uncovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Rogaine package arrived 2 months ago, I ordered a 6 month-package. I use it twice a day, without missing a day. I also take hair vitamins (biotion, B1,B2,B6 etc) just to ensure my hair has the sufficient material to &amp;#34;work with&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put Rogain to the crown area and to the frontal area. Sometimes I drop some to the mid-scalp and massage it into my full head, just to experiement wether it stops the general hair-fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process was the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - in the first 2 weeks no sign has shown, my hair fall increased, it was a bit scary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - after the 3-4 week my hair fall has lessened, and some minor baby hair started appearing in the frontal area of my scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - after 6 weeks the baby hair got thicker and my hair falling almost stopped (still some fall, but I guess its the normal pace now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  - after 8-9 weeks: my frontal area has almost completely grown back, the hair is very similar to how it was 4-5 years ago. The crown area is also showing improvements, there are no uncovered bald spots any more. When I touch my crown, I cannot feel my bare scalp anywhere. There is still much to improve in the crown, but the newly grown baby hairs are giving it a semi-transparent layer, which is very nice. I am sure in a few weeks/months these baby hairs will also get much thicker, just like on my frontal area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side effects:&lt;br /&gt; - no side affects on my libido at all&lt;br /&gt; - my hair has gotten dandruff, lot of flaking happens. I guess its time to use Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt; - it makes my scalp dry, and because of this it itches sometimes (the itching is very minor). I started using a natual coconut-milk product, which help a lot about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: it DOES work, it gives back my confidence, and makes me feel young again. I can finally style my hair which I could not do in the past 3-4 years.&lt;br /&gt;I hope the improvements will continue in the upcoming moths and I can grow back all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5* is not even questionable from me.alp dry, and because of this it itches sometimes (the itching is very minor).

    <li> I started using Rogaine about 4 years ago. I was pretty happy with the results. Then I did some research and found that women should use the man&#x27;s strength of Rogaine Otherwise you aren&#x27;t getting enough to make a big difference. They make the men and women strength because they didn&#x27;t do testing of the 5% on women.  I started using the 5% and it has made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I know that a full 4 month treatment is required for optimal results. but after two months  i can say that i have noticed a reduction in hair loss. no regrowth yet. I will try the rogaine foam next time because the liquid leaves a greasy feel and complicate styling.</li>
    <li> its like some time it&#x27;s stops falling hairs, then it starts falling hairs again while using it&lt;br /&gt;we have mixed feelings about it.he is using it from 10 months he is Asian and have black ,thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;No idea it&#x27;s works or not just my husband keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;he do&#x27;t want to take chance to blame him self.</li>
    <li> initially days you may have look more hair but basically its just texture appearance change due to dry and hardness. later stage  found because of dryness and hard hairs, hairs are breaking from root. Ended up adding more hair loss...</li>
    <li> Definitely works, grows new hair.  Hair still thin, but at least its not bald back there.  Seems more effective than generic equivalents, and the carrier fluid is not as sticky.</li>
    <li> After using it consistently, I&#x27;ve really seen a difference.. and it gets better every day. Works really well for me.</li>
    <li> awesome have been using it and have seen real results , i stopped using it for 2 weeks and definitely saw the bad result , i am back on it and full long amazing hair back</li>
    <li> This product might work for some, but it did not work for me.  Hair was no thicker after 8 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m taking finasteride and rogaine for more than an year and now only my hair stop falling as it began growing up again. I&#x27;m really satisfied with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if finasteride is better than the Rogaine because I started taking them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I totally recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> The only way I&#x27;d recommend using this is if your doctor specifically says it&#x27;s ok and might work for you. Otherwise don&#x27;t waste your money and go through the misery of watching your hair fall out everytime you touch it, a gust of wind blows, or even just by looking at it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 26 and I noticed my hairline was receding plus thinning on top so I wanted to do something about it. After some research I decided to give this a shot. BIG MISTAKE! My hair began to fall out like crazy. I would wash my hair and look at my hands to find at least 80-100 hairs covering them. Everytime I washed my hair! Not to mention the hair I noticed falling out throughout the day. I would guess on a normal day I was losing around 400-500 hairs a day. I thought this was normal because the product says you&#x27;ll loose hair for about the first two weeks. This lasted a month! After that I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and threw it all away and excepted my hair was going to fall out but at least not as fast as Rogaine was making it.&lt;br /&gt;I did some more research and found a multivitamin called Hair Essentials which not only cost less ( 35$ a month) but actually stopped my hair loss, thickened my hair, and is now regrowing what I lost with Rogaine. I can now run my hands through my hair and maybe see one or two hairs fall out. I can&#x27;t help but smile everytime!&lt;br /&gt;This pill might not have the same results for everyone but from all the research and heartache I went through to find an end to my hair loss I feel like I had to let people thinking about using Rogaine know what my experience was. Hope this helps and you don&#x27;t go bald!</li>
    <li> It works very well if your hair loss is due to lack of blood flow in the follicles. A lot of people say it doesn&#x27;t work but it&#x27;s probably because they didn&#x27;t consult a dermatologist before buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a re-growth of about half an inch in the upper part of the forehead (it&#x27;s where I had the hair loss problem) and with zero side effects after using it for 6 months twice a day, every day.</li>
    <li> Good product......great seller!</li>
    <li> Two reasons for low rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is only supposed to treat hair loss due to genetics. Not for hair loss due to age or chemical use. This is not clear from any description they publish online. Some people would say - who cares if it grows new hair - well I do for the reason that I need to use it for the rest of my life to keep the hair that it grew. While I am only looking to get my regular / thinning hair that I lost because of hair treatments and swimming too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, no returns at all. So my money went waste. I didn&#x27;t know until I opened the box  that it is only to be used for hair loss due to hereditary reasons.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it did not seem to work even after using it for period of time.  I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Jan 2011... This is my experience. I had slight balding on my vertex severe thinning around my temples, and slight thinning on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 9 months of using, I cut my hair really short to see what if anything happened. The bald spot on my vertex is nearly gone. I&#x27;m much thicker on top. My temples have started growing some, but it is peach fuzz. It does appear thicker and more plentiful than it did a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve reduced from twice daily to once at night. Using 1ml per application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side effects... dandruff, very heavy about once a week. It&#x27;s easily managed, but can be unpredictable. About 30 minutes after application, sometimes I get a headache as I feel it working. Goes away/get used to it fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foam smelled. It wasn&#x27;t an unpleasant odor, but it was a noticable odor.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the topical solution, but it takes some time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 11/24/2011... cut my hair short again. Only the faintest hint of balding on my vertex or on top. The temples though, they defy all attempts. Heavy peach fuzz never developed into real hair. Dandruff is nearly non-existent since moving to 1 ml/day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate Rogaine as 5 stars because it did what they advertised it to do. I was hopeful about the temples, grateful for the thickening on top, but the product does state that it works on the vertex.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 1/2 years now. One application a day in the mornings, across the entire top of the scalp. And basically, my hair loss has completely stopped and I&#x27;ve seen minor regrowth across the entire application area. Enough to feel the thickness a bit more and enough to attempt more ambitious hairstyles again. Like other reviewers, it took me about 3 months before I noticed effects, and in that time I had a lot of itching and dryness. I had been using it 2x/day as recommended, and cut back to 1x/day, and also started using an anti-dandruff/anti-itching shampoo, which mostly alleviated the issues. Though I do still have minor itchiness, the hair growth is completely worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- It works. Stick with it, be diligent and patient, and you&#x27;ll see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Dry/itchy scalp. But this can be mitigated with the right shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s kind of oily and weird. So if you apply it in the mornings, you have to figure out how to make it your de-facto styling product. I basically apply it, do a quick finger-comb, let it set a few minutes while I brush my teeth, then towel-dry and do a final styling. Works well for certain hairstyles.</li>
    <li> Only time will tell, I will keep you posted?</li>
    <li> Ordered this by mistake thinking it was the unscented foam.&lt;br /&gt; I imagine it works as described so this isn&#x27;t a comment on the effectiveness of the product.&lt;br /&gt; It comes with three bottles and one syringe to use.</li>
    <li> While Rogaine doesn&#x27;t seem to grow new hair for me, it does keep my hair from falling out.  I would recommend this product to everyone who has hair loss.</li>
    <li> Completely unreliable and actually just makes things worse.  After 6 months, just caused more shedding than anything.  Stopped using it, shedding came to almost a complete halt.</li>
    <li> Bait and switch. You order the foam and they change it to liquid. NOT COOL. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a while and found nothing better for hair loss than this. once you start you cannot quite otherwise you gonna loose your  hair again.</li>
    <li> My son asked for this product for Christmas because it works so well and so I got the best price and deal right here on Amazon.com! always the best products at the best prices!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I (a female) use Rogaine for Men due to my hair loss and thinning hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it 2x daily since mid-July.  Although my hair loss has slowed and new hair is growing in, I can&#x27;t say for sure if it&#x27;s due to Rogaine.  I&#x27;ve subsequently started taking a thyroid prescription and can expect another 6 months of hair loss due to this condition.  The Rogaine should be applied directly to the scalp, then rubbed in with a finger, trying to avoid getting it on too much hair.  When it&#x27;s gotten on my hair it dries and feels sticky and gritty.  It changes the texture of my hair and my hair tends to look greasy with the Rogaine.  However, I am determined to continue using it for another few months since every doctor I ask does recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband is using this product since 3 months ago and it works, the hair is thicker and it&#x27;s growing very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second treatment that I bought for him, I hope that works as fine as the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to apply it twice a day, one on the morning and one on the evening.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a long time twice a day I actually use this and take propecia and use a lasercomb it creates light hairs in the back of my head it&#x27;s weird though I think the hairs aren&#x27;t strong whenever I brush my hair they fall out I think but I do notice a difference it has covered up in the back of my head</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me I tried  it for 3 months. I took picture before and after 3 months and my hair feels and looks exactly the same. It gets really itchy if you don&#x27;t wash your hair before using it.</li>
    <li> I started using this about 3 months ago.  I guess everyone reading gets to the point where one notices the thinning hair and does something about it, and so I tried this.  You really won&#x27;t see much to start, so it is difficult to justify and continue.  It&#x27;s been 3 months, and I notice some real improvements.  In my case, by my own observation it was better than what is pictured for the product, so I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The twice a day is hard to keep up with, so I&#x27;m probably only using it 5x per week...so it&#x27;s like a 7 month supply.  It still seems to be working, and I intend to try using it more in the morning rather than just at night.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t appear to work for everyone, but I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I tried to go with the generic K-brand and felt that it wasn&#x27;t as effective as the real deal.  This, to me, works better and is worth the extra money.  The bottles came sealed and it even came with it&#x27;s own 1mL dripper which has a screw on lid so you can discard the lid that came with the bottle and just screw on the dripper as the lid.  (Hope that makes sense.)  I should also add that the liquid doesn&#x27;t dye my hair black.  I have dark brown hair with natural red highlights and the foam dyed the front (I use ths on my hairline) of my hair black.</li>
    <li> I tried it once and immediately realized I should have ordered the foam instead. Unless your hair is thinning on the very top of your head (and your head is flat) you&#x27;ll have liquid running down your scalp. And one other important thing to note - Amazon will NOT accept returns on this item because it&#x27;s considered a &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34;. So don&#x27;t repeat my $40 mistake...</li>
    <li> I used Rogaine 2% for a month and saw little to no effects. Didn&#x27;t even feel anythiing when putting it on. Been on this for a couple of weeks now, and my hair feels thicker. Head starts itching a couple of hours after application so I know it&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Worked really well,  but with this product it&#x27;s a life time of using it to have the benefit to last.  Not economical unless it&#x27;s on sale which is how I bought it.  Refuse to pay the high price when it&#x27;s not on sale.</li>
    <li> It works very good for me, a mazing production</li>
    <li> totally forgot to get the foam kind.  i really dont like this stuff.  Makes your hair greasy and nasty.</li>
    <li> I cannot give it a true rating yet because it takes a few months to start working.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought I had purchased.  Not foam, but liquid.  Liquid much more difficult to work with.  Runs so difficult to concentrate in one area. I felt like there were small gains made with the foam so we&#x27;ll see with this version.</li>
    <li> My wife started buying me the foam version of Rogaine a while ago and it worked fine.  She took issue with the thinning spot atop my melon.  My only complaint with it was that dosing it out was a pain because I could never really measure the half cap volume that it called for very well.  When she ordered this version for me with the dropper it made it a lot easier to get the right amount applied to my scalp.  I really like how much easier this is for me to use than I have been accustomed to.</li>
    <li> Works very well! I am 26 and started noticing hair loss on my crown. Had receding temples for 6 years, but very slowing receding (mainly temples). I didn&#x27;t mind the maturing (or maybe slightly receding) hairline since I always had a big forhead, but I was very worried when I saw my hair at my crown get noticeably thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine stopped my hair from receding further and hair has grown back on my crown (no longer is there any noticeable thinning) and excellent hair growth near front of my hair line. Since I find the solution to be oily and take well over an hour to fully dry, I only apply at night, about 5x/wk (1ml on the scalp and 1ml in the front). I really like how the product makes your hair look after sleeping with it on your scalp overnight. Works great. I started to see results in ~5 weeks. I had significant shedding in the first month, but hair grew in way stronger than the amount shed.</li>
    <li> fine. maybe Lipogaine is better!</li>
    <li> Hey it&#x27;s been little bit over a month now since I start using it! I must say that since of start I didn&#x27;t miss a dose yet and oh man ... I think it&#x27;s working ! I mean I am happy cuz my hair become thicker but I must say that I didn&#x27;t wait to loose my hair! Based on my genetics I start loosing hair on the crown area and little bit front, I have notice it last year I got way less hair in the crown area and I start using it now and in just about month I saw results! I think secret is don&#x27;t wait to loose all hair to start using rogaine! Use it ASAP when u see thinning spots! I have more headache I think but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Rogaine is a good product, and I prefer the brand name over generic. I have more confidence that it works on hair regrowth, and have actually found it not to be as watery as some generic brands I have used. I buy locally, because I have found it to be more cost efficient.</li>
    <li> itchy and loss more hair.</li>
    <li> It was very much recommended to me</li>
    <li> This formula works way better then the foam.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical just as every other buyer was although I must say this product works!! I had thinning and balding in the front of my scalp on the left and right side. I decided to give this a shot even though it says it is primarily for use on the crown (rear, top of head) area. Just as the instructions say, you may loose more hair over the first couple of weeks but you must let it run its full course. After 2 months I began to see major improvements and by the third month I&#x27;ve seen unbelievable results. You must be consistent and apply twice a day, every day. Now my hair is thick and fuller than ever! This product is the real deal!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner and was as described</li>
    <li> Not sure if anyone is looking at this stuff for their beard or not... but it works splendidly for your beard! I used this product on certain areas of my beard that were not as full as the rest, and it worked perfectly. Filled out my beard in no time, and same color as the rest.</li>
    <li> hi i just want to said that i was really happy and satisfaid you the Rogaine, and i will continue to ordering the rogaine</li>
    <li> I believe that if you want to see results using this product you need to use twice a day as directed and dilugently.</li>
    <li> I had noticed that my temporal hairlines were receding (male pattern baldness) and also some hair loss on the rear of my head. This was in the early stages but I knew for sure that its gonna get worse with time. I was hunting for a solution and Rogaine seemed convincing at least for my rear-head baldness. Rogaine didn&#x27;t assure restoration of temporal hair loss, BUT NOT IN MY CASE. I gave it a try on both my receding hairlines and my rear head... And to my surprise I started seeing tiny little hair babies starting out from nowhere in my temporal lines :-) And I was so amazed and glad to see that I m getting back my youth hair lines...Of course it cured my rear-side baldness which was even faster than the frontal hairs. Ok, now enough about my results... if u are looking for quick results u might get for rear baldness or any spot baldness on top of the head...but for temporal hair loss restoration u got to wait for a few weeks and keep applying Rogaine day and night without losing hope...It has worked for me in this case and I m so glad to recommend this product for anyone to give it a try... Absolutely no side effects !!! After applying this serum, u might feel it slightly getting into your head which might be a little heavier feeling than usual, doesn&#x27;t hurt you though...</li>
    <li> It is only for baldness on the crown of the head. Something that it does not specify or vaguely does so.</li>
    <li> It doesnt show hair regrowth yet after 14 months of use. Atleast it has stopped further hairfall.</li>
    <li> I have seen growth and positive results</li>
    <li> I purchased this item along with a shampoo named Perfect hair Regrowth Shampoo containing DHT Inhibitor. Its been about six weeks and I am see new growth. Amazing .</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see any progress, used by a month</li>
    <li> I bought this product and then found out that it will not work for my particular type of balding. Now I cannot return it even though I never opened it and I&#x27;m out $85. Further, I also found out that if you ever stop using Rogaine, you&#x27;re hair falls out quicker than if you never used it at all.  WARNING: If you buy this, it cannot be returned, it only works on one specific type of baldness, and if you ever stop using, all your hair will fall out.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with several other commenters--this stuff works better than the generic.  I&#x27;m not sure why or how, but I have gotten more results with the three bottles of this stuff than with months of using the Kroger / Target / Wal-Mart brands of the same solution.</li>
    <li> i was using it for over a year now... it seems that i am on the percent that the product do not work... but my friend says it worked for him so... 3 stars good for me i guess</li>
    <li> Im a black female  with hair lose and the stuff didn&#x27;t work for me still no hair. Will not be buying again</li>
    <li> Even though this product is not recommend for Hairline loss, accordingly the documented research you can use Minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;I had a windows peak hairline and it started heading north in my 30&#x27;s and even in my 40&#x27;s it did not bother me, I was still able to have the nice wave. No that I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s it bothers me a great deal not enough hair for the wave.  What bothered me more that the hair loss was the way the scalp looked, it is a different color that my forehead and a slight different texture of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the Minoxidil I am using the Minioxidin a pill, and the Biotin.  I have not used it long enough to see any results but I am confident I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using on hairline loss be sure you keep within the lines of your original hairline, I believe this is why it&#x27;s not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a few months</li>
    <li> The fulfillment was prompt. The delivery was fast. But, I had forgotten why I stopped using the original Rogaine formula years ago. It stinks. Literally. It&#x27;s a pain to apply. It&#x27;s overpriced. The foam is such an improvement. And far more effective. I have no one to blame but myself. I ordered this crud. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
    <li> I STARTED PURCHASING THIS ROGAIN FOR MY HUBBY AFTER HIS GENETIC HAIR LOSS, AND THE HAIR OF HIS CROWN HAS GROWN BACK, AS SOON AS MY HUBBY FORGETS TO USE IT, HE FINDS  LOTS OF HAIRS ON THE PILLOW.&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO STARTED DEVELOPING HORMONAL HAIR LOSS AND STARTED USING THIS ROGAIN FOR MEN, WHICH IS STRONGER THAN THE ONE FOR WOMEN WHICH I USED TOO, THE HAIR AROUND MY HAIR LINE IS GROWING SLOWLY, THE ONLY PROBLEM I FIND IS THAT IT CAUSES DANDRUFF ON MY SCALP.&lt;br /&gt;i ALSO APPLY ROGAIN ON MY EYEBROWS AND THEY ARE GROWING!!! THE DOWNSIDE, HAIR ON MY FACE SO I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN I APPLY IT.</li>
    <li> Always had no problem with this product. Found that this is more reliable then the far less expensive alternatives which aren&#x27;t always trust worthy especially in their ingredients.</li>
    <li> not sure if it works, but I will try it</li>
    <li> I have been used this product for 3 years and really works. You just need 2 minutes in the morning and 2 minutes in the afternoon  and some patience</li>
    <li> I receive on time. Very good! Thanks</li>
    <li> Allready have family &amp;friends asking what im doing different.</li>
    <li> It REALLY works!!! Just bought the 4th pack! My parents are super-happy with the effect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited for well over a year to write my review to make sure it really works. Yes - this product is advertised for men and I&#x27;m a woman but I spoke with my doctor who said there was no problem with my using this formula (I&#x27;m postmenopausal.) I&#x27;m not recommending that women use it - just telling you my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair began to thin on the crown of my head just like my mothers and grandmothers did (my husband, on the other hand, still has a full head of thick hair and his dad was bald - go figure.) I hated that you could see scalp back there when my hair decided to part on its own during the day. I&#x27;m still in the workforce and don&#x27;t want to look any older than I am so I tried various shampoos and conditioners that are supposed to help with this problem - they didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I used the foam Rogaine and started to see very noticeable results in 6 months. Then I accidentally ordered the liquid and found that I liked it better because it went directly to my scalp and didn&#x27;t hang on my hair as much as the foam did. I do end up using more product with the liquid though. Regardless - they both work. The directions recommend applying at night and morning but I only use it at night because it messes with my hair styling when I use it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No side effects - I don&#x27;t have any hair growing where I don&#x27;t want it like the palms of my hands or sideburns or anything - perhaps because I am careful to apply it only on my crown and then I make sure I wash my hands right away. The new hair texture is now the same as the rest of my hair (it is a bit peach-fuzzy when it first starts working but nothing weirdly noticeable to anyone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results and plan to keep using this as long as it works unless something better comes along. I&#x27;m a willing guinea pig - always ready to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Almost another year has gone by - I&#x27;m still using the product. I continue to see improvement without any side effects. Since my hair is on the fine side I don&#x27;t always wash my hair every day and on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair I don&#x27;t apply the product and I haven&#x27;t seen any problem. I only use the product on the areas that were thinning.n&#x27;t always wash my hair every day and on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair I don&#x27;t apply the product and I haven&#x27;t seen any problem. I only use the product on the areas that were thinning.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for over 10 years, and it really works! I have restored all my hair loss and no longer have a bald spot in the the crown of my head. This supplier also sells it for about $10 less than anyone else, so I highly recommend Progaine and this supplier!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too strong for my scalp. I&#x27;m not really blaming Amazon or anyone else for it but it wasn&#x27;t a good experience. I bought all of that &amp; was unable to use it. I can&#x27;t say I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This product absolutely save my hair , best price in the market</li>
    <li> Way better than the Costco clone.&lt;br /&gt;Stick to the Original, The generic Costco brand  did nothing for me after six months, The first three days of this product has help me more.</li>
    <li> Rogaine does grow hair. Whatever hair I have on the top of my head is totally a result of Rogaine. While it may not turn fine hair into tree trunk sized hair, better to have something, even fine hair than nothing. So Rogaine is better than nothing in a manner of speaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The earlier (in age) one starts using it, the better the results will be. I am please with what it is doing for me so ( and I am not young) I keep on using it. Simple, eh?</li>
    <li> very good product and amazing I used to put this material on my scalp and with delay result that appear after more than month.</li>
    <li> It worked on my edges. Bought it again for another 3 months</li>
    <li> I am a 26 years old male with family history of male pattern baldness from both sides.My hair started thinning at the age of 22 and it got very noticeable by the age of 25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with rogaine: day 1 - day 45 a long and depressing shedding phase, I thought I will loose all the hair I had left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;day 45 - day 90 hair loss stabilized new baby hair showing (so called peach fuzz)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;day 90 - day 120 Noticeable results (people around me asked what am I doing to my hair) hair is growing stronger, the hair is fuller but it feels like I am still loosing the weak hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I did not use any supplements or special shampoo, just rogaine and a good diet meaning lots of vegetables; liquids and avoiding red meat.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product several times now and I&#x27;m told that it works. It appears that I would keep buying it. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> This is the only effective treatment to use if you want to save your hair and look.. The active ingredient (minoxidil) is only treatment approved by FDA for the treatment of genetic hair loss.</li>
    <li> Good experience&lt;br /&gt;Quick shopping tricks on amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Followed instructions carefully, yet 0 results. Will never buy again. Will let nature take it&#x27;s course instead and buy hats instead!</li>
    <li> This a good monoxidil product, although i wish it was a spray rather than a drip cap. I used it for about three weeks. I didn&#x27;t get any allergy or itching like some reviews mentioned. Its very oily but once it dries out it feels and looks good. However, i noticed i have some dandruff, ive never had dandruff before and i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of Rogaine. i will continue using it anyway.</li>
    <li> I used this for my beard and it works!!!!</li>
    <li> It really works, it takes time but it works</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Takes a million years to start working, and if you look at the ingredients, is all chemicals you are applying to your hair. It is better to take Biotin, and it works better and faster.&lt;br /&gt;Best for your regrowth is Biotin, and check on what are you eating that is causing hair loss, sometimes some reaction for medication that dries up your skin can also cause hair loss. If nothing else works, its genetic. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Made all my hair fall out.  No coming back from that.  1 year long user, never missed a treatment.</li>
    <li> It stopped my loss hair, but not note any new hair.I&#x27;m using it by four months.</li>
    <li> Experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman with moderate genetic hair loss at the front top and temples. I had diffuse thinning that was noticeable and getting worse. I started using this product about 1.5 years ago. I use it every day, no exceptions. However, admittedly, for the past year I have been applying it only once a day instead of the directed twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely works and I am quite pleased with the difference it has made. The sparse areas are now reasonably filled in, minimizing the scalp&#x27;s real estate compared to hair strands. I see results everywhere I have applied Rogaine, with the most success at the temples. If I had to pick the area that is the least dramatic I would say the very front/ above the forehead. But I was told by a hair loss specialist that this area always sees fewer changes no matter what grow product is used. But again, even here I see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days a casual observer does not notice my hair loss. That&#x27;s what I want: I want it to be good enough so that I do not feel it is glaringly obvious to the casual observer. But yes, someone who is rooting around up there *looking* for my hair loss will see areas of lesser density. My sister, who has a closer vantage point and knows the issue, thinks the result has been great. The diameter of the hairs that have come in also appear a bit thicker than my thinning hair, though it may not be due to the Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who Should and Should Not Bother Using This Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that, much like anything else, the results of Rogaine depend largely on the user:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, if you expect to see results in 2 weeks, move on. This product takes 3 months to show meaningful results, though you will begin to see sprouts at about 6 weeks. If you know a bit about a hair&#x27;s growth cycle you will understand why. I am bemused by the negative reviews written by folks who say, \\&quot;I tried it for 10 days and saw zero results.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s like watering tomato seeds in a garden one week and demanding to see a harvest the next.  Growth cycles just don&#x27;t work that fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, if you know you are not the type of person that will commit to using this product every single day, move on. Your hair follicles must be constantly stimulated by this product in order to grow and stay in your head. The product is not long acting (about 12 hours per application, hence the 2X day recommendation for top flight results) , so once you start skipping days (especially consecutive days), your will jeopardize the results. If you stop using Rogaine altogether the growth will fall out before the year is out. However as I said I have been using this 1X a day and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results I got. It&#x27;s just that applying it 2x per day would provide maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, if you have unrealistic expectations, move on. This product will not give you the lush, thick, hair you probably never had. The reality is that your hair loss is the result of a complex confluence of hormones and genetic factors that scientists don&#x27;t yet fully understand. This product will act to fill in the spaces and minimize the amount of scalp that shines through, but it cannot perform miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liquid vs Foam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first purchased the foam, and then moved to the liquid. I recommend the foam for those whose spots are mostly bald. If you have a fair amount of hair in that spot, use the liquid, because the foam just coats the hair and fails to fully penetrate the actual scalp where it needs to be. Yes the liquid can run if you are slow to rub it in but you learn how to control it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Consistency &amp; Smell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product contains a bit of glycolic (I think, or something very similar) to act as a mild exfoliant of the skin so that the product penetrates better. This may feel a little itchy to some people, and some people may notice flakes (exfoliated skin) but this will go away once your skin gets used to the product. I did not feel any sensitivity and only at the start did I notice just a few flakes in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understand also that the product will make your hair dirty sooner and in need of more frequent washing if you do not already wash your hair every day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice any strong odor. There is a vague smell to it in the bottle but this does not carry over in the one serving you apply to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Considerations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eating crap and not exercising has not caused your genetic hair loss, but the cascade of hormones created by a poor lifestyle are exacerbating your problem. Period. I struggle with this all the time, but over the past 2 years I&#x27;ve gotten serious about not making life harder for the hormones responsible for keeping my hair in my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also stopped using hairspray, mousse, and gel. I had no idea that the chemicals in hair products (especially hairspray) strip the hair strand so much that it thins and breaks. For those with thick and super healthy hair this isn&#x27;t noticeable. But for us it is. Since I stopped using hair products i have seen improvements that I do not attribute to the Rogaine. (I.e. Hairs stop breaking as easily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High heat blowdryers, hair extensions, and constant dye jobs are also exacerbating the thinning of your hair. I notice all my hair looks so much healthier in the 15 months since I stopped the extensions, blow dry only for special occasions, and use only demi hair color (which does not strip hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give Rogaine a try, be patient and give it the time it needs to work, and have realistic expectations. I think you&#x27;ll find the results satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I took off one star because I think the price the company sets for this product is too high.d not feel any sensitivity and only at the start did I notice just a few flakes in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understand also that the product will make your hair dirty sooner and in need of more frequent washing if you do not already wash your hair every day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice any strong odor.

    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any good results in the 3 months I tried it. So I&#x27;m not going to spend more on it. It&#x27;s hard to remember to apply it at night as you have to wait some time for it to dry a bit on your scalp, if not, all is going to stay in your pillow.</li>
    <li> The foam is better, this stuff is too runny.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it really works. I have beeing using for four years now and it does what it supose to do.</li>
    <li> My husband loves to use this product!</li>
    <li> i have only used this product for almost 2 weeks and I can&#x27;t say anything yet till I get results in a few months.</li>
    <li> I am regularly using it for 8 months now and it has worked for me definitely.</li>
    <li> I am a women who around 8 years ago lost half of her hair, no bald spots just something hormonal that caused a lot of shedding. I was using baby ponytail holders, because my hair had thinned so much. I started using this and within 4 months you could see little spikey hairs all over my head. It was new growth and I was so excited. About 2 years of use my hair was much fuller and now I won&#x27;t be without it. I have my hair back to the fullness I had once before if not a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I only use this when I shampoo, which is about 2-3 times per week. I might of had results a little sooner had I used daily, but it did make my scalp greasy if I use on dry hair. If I want to use it more I put it on at bedtime, so it is on my scalp for at least 8 hours, I think it only needs 4 and then I can wash my hair in the morning. If not I just use after I shampoo and towel dry. I like Rogaine better than the generic, which is cheaper, but made my hair on my scalp feel really gross, not oily just sticky and stiff.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Product - been using for a long time - my hair stylist recommended it for my hair thinning and it&#x27;s absolutely AMAZING</li>
    <li> I have 4 older brothers and they have all lost most of their hair.&lt;br /&gt;When my hair started thinning a few years ago, I started using Rogain and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;Because I hate using any chemicals, about once a year I stop using it for a couple of months and my hair starts to thin again.&lt;br /&gt;So I just go back to using it and it returns.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it works for everyone, but it does for me.</li>
    <li> Beware this is a sex drive killer.  I am a 38 year old male in excellent shape.  I run and lift daily, recently I started getting a little thin on top so I decided to try Rogaine.  I applied twice daily as directed for about 3 months.  Prior to using Rogaine my sex life was great.  My wife and I usually had sex 2-4 times per week.  About a month in I began noticing my sex drive declining.  It was as if I had no desire for sex and when we did have sex it took longer to get an erection.  My erections were not the same quality that they used to be.  I was chalking it up to getting older but it came on so quickly that I started to do some research.  I just never made the connection between Rogaine and sex drive.  Fortunately info on the net revealed many more cases like mine.  I quit using the stuff about a week ago and I already feel myself slowly getting back to normal.  My sex drive is returning and my face doesn&#x27;t look as puffy.  They don&#x27;t list this as a side effect on the bottle but the crap would be a lot harder to sell if they did.  Do some research before you use this stuff and good luck I wish you the best and hopefully it works for you as advertised. Personally  I would rather be bald than have my junk quit working.  Oh and the results on the hair regrowth were minimal at best.</li>
    <li> Always  a plus to purchase  Rogaine at a great price.  The product truly does work and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Rogaine the best of minoxidil product. Its more expensive than other minoxidil product because of its high quality of minoxidil that is used. So its better to be expensive but high quality, than not expensive but low quality minoxidil product.</li>
    <li> The product really does work. Noticed a difference 2 weeks from initial use. For those with hair product usage, I suggest a shower before using Rogaine at night.</li>
    <li> I have to admit it really works.  I was originally using the foam for the front of my scalp but could not do much with the back.  I start using this about 3 months ago and have seen improvements.  My bald spot has been disappearing.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It works well for me and worth the money. I will recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> I have been suffered from pattern baldness for over 18 years. This product actually caused hair growth without irritation or harmful side effects</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> When I purchased the product I had n0 idea that it was to be used for the back bald spots not&lt;br /&gt;for receding hair in the front of my head. I sent the product back to the seller but nothing has&lt;br /&gt;happened please investigate for me because I like buying from Amazon. thank you.</li>
    <li> I, like you, was also perusing these Amazon reviews for a while before I made the purchase. I was thinning at the front part of my head and getting really upset about it. Eventually I just ponied up and made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my amazing relief, it worked! My hair started to get thicker and that sinking feeling in my stomach just went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on in the morning after I shower and though it is a bit of a pain, you get used to it and it just becomes part of the routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, if you&#x27;re skeptical just buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> works well together with women rogaine, will def re-order. Although my parcel was delivered to the wrong apartment we finally found it. lol</li>
    <li> bought it for my friend</li>
    <li> What can you say. This stuff works for me. Even grow hair where it&#x27;s not supposed to (In the front of the head). My Father and both Grandfathers were bald. Take a look at this picture of me (Yes it&#x27;s me and yes that&#x27;s my hair). Rogaine is all I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> It really works for my wife&lt;br /&gt;But you have to keep using it for the rest of your life&lt;br /&gt;Cuse if you stopped using the hair start to fall again</li>
    <li> This stuff is tough to keep on your head and much more tedious than the foam ! Stick with the foam</li>
    <li> The worst product... OMG after next day after using it, have started to loose a lot of hair it was so bad, unbelievable, I&#x27;m not happy at all. Smells so bad. STAY AWAY FROM ROGAINE!!! Also could not return the product (((</li>
    <li> IM IN THE BEAUTY FIELD, and this product has NOT worked for me~!  I have been using this prduct for over a year,............no difference!  save yourself the $  and try BOSELY........</li>
    <li> I have in my hand wicht I bought.&lt;br /&gt;Is my second time that I buy it because it works as is as the manufacturer says.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Does a great job with restoring your hair. My hair has gotten much thicker since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever lose my beautiful head of hair, but it&#x27;s going fast. I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, just that it didn&#x27;t work for my type of hair loss.</li>
    <li> Well it took awhile, months actually, but I have seen great results. I can&#x27;t 100% say it&#x27;s from just this, as I am on generic Propecia, Rogaine twice a day, and Nioxin shampoo daily. Combined it&#x27;s a little pricey, but I went from practically bald (in the front and the crop circle in the back) to close to a full head of hair. I shaved my head completely with a number 1 and started from scratch, and now it has fully grown back in after some years of constant receding. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s mainly the Propecia, but the others def help</li>
    <li> Works for me. I only expected it to stop my hair loss it was falling out all day and really bad in the shower. since using I have stopped losing hair and my wife says it looks thicker and feels like it did when I was younger I have also noticed the different feel of my hair. I am very happy</li>
    <li> it took some time to see a liitle growth.it works!</li>
    <li> This product only targets a specific area in the back of the head 👎</li>
    <li> I  used it,  I think it working well. I have bought 2 bottles before used this one completely.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for approximately 3 months and there has been hair growth. After 3 more months if the improvement continues I would give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> First tine user.  It is not easy to get the product to scalp.  Have to pour the liquid out to a container and then apply it.  Alternatively, one must dip a finger into the liquid in the bottle and rub it on scalp.  Can&#x27;t think of a third way.  Either way, it is a clumsy process and a waste of product.  Does this product  work?  That is a TBD question.</li>
    <li> Only thing is  I got a bit of dandruff but they tell you that may be a side effect. Other than that its been working great I see changes. I&#x27;m 26 been seeing thinning in one spot for the last 2 years.</li>
    <li> this is the best dollar per unit price I could find even two months after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The foam just didn&#x27;t do much. I actually see results with this. And it&#x27;s easier to keep that 1mL amount per use.&lt;br /&gt;Also applying the liquid seems easier than applying the foam. Just spread the hair away and drop those drops.</li>
    <li> It didnt work for me the liquid was watery and would dry quickly. Went back to rogaine.</li>
    <li> it is good,but people should use it continously</li>
    <li> I would like to change my opinion about the kleiner USA Laden company because it was not the company&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time was as described.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily for hair loss. It was recommended by my Dermatologist. It works. It arrived in a timely manner @ I will reotdrt</li>
    <li> This might be useful for anybody deciding whether to get this or the foam version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Rogaine foam for about six months before switching to the liquid dropper.  Many of the reviews herald the foam as being much easier to use, which would be true if you are applying it to an area with very little hair.  But in my case, I&#x27;m not bald, I just had thinning hair all over, while the hair that I did have I kept at about 4-5 inches long.  When I used the foam, it would act more like a styling mousse, and it felt like 90% got in my hair while only a small fraction of it actually got on my scalp.  As such, after six months I had somewhat noticeable results only on the &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34; part where I could more easily reach the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switching to the dropper meant I could reach all of my scalp with very little getting caught in my hair.  So if you have thinning but still not-too-bad hair (and you&#x27;re using Rogaine more as a proactive measure before it gets worse) and you have your hair longer than a couple inches, absolutely get the dropper over the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to say, though, that one of the detriments to using this is it seems to kind of dry up and flake some, so it&#x27;s kind of like a whole new battle with dandruff, which isn&#x27;t overly fun.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really have a bald spot before, my hair was just thinning, so I can&#x27;t tell for sure if it worked, but I think my hair feels thicker, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it didn&#x27;t make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t do anything near temples, but it wasn&#x27;t supposed to anyway.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the money..</li>
    <li> The delivery ecellent and I am using the product well now.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure I will be happy after 3months trial &amp; I will keep use it via Amazone service.</li>
    <li> This is liquid - even though it&#x27;s clearly in the &#x27;foam&#x27; section.</li>
    <li> this showed no results.....</li>
    <li> My husband likes this product and has been using it for years. The reason I gave it four stars is because the online usage instructions refer to this product as foam, which my husband greatly prefers, but this came in liquid, non-foaming form, so he is disappointed. The liquid tends to run, while the foam stays put.  It would have been nice, if the instructions had not been misleading and I&#x27;m sure others would appreciate if the seller would correct this . Otherwise, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Have noticed a decrease in my hair loss. But I still havent seen any regrowth. I do hear that it takes time for regrowth tho.</li>
    <li> If you have hair loss, Rogaine can help you. It&#x27;s important that your hair loss is not in advanced stage. This product works better in the beginning hair loss stage. However, first of all visit a doctor.</li>
    <li> way more effective than the foam was.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have a full head if hair, but I was starting to lose the fullness of my downstairs beard. Rubbed some rogaine on it and BAM, the mane has returned! If it&#x27;s getting back your curly cues in all their glory, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> My dermotologist recommended this, but even if my hair started growing I could stand to but this in my hair each day, it felt icky.</li>
    <li> Good deal and seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> I am really not sure if this product is working or not. I&#x27;ve been using regain for four months now and other people notice my hair is getting thicker. I started with the Rogaine regular strength for three months and then switched to the extra strength. The reason I rated this product with 5 stars is because others notice something and how easy it is to apply. I shave my head once a week for maximum absorption and to use less Rogaine. I am going to continue to use Rogaine for a year, then i will let my hair grow back (while i am still using) too see if there is a difference. If so, then I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Personally I believe the generic is not the same and I usually am fine w generics</li>
    <li> Works for me. Started in October and March was noticeably thicker. Some itching. Some flaking due too dried product when using recommend dose. I use how ever much my scalp wants at that time. Im not supper consistent. I slow usage when it itches.</li>
    <li> I, who has  always  said  if  my  hair  goes  so  do  I. Well  at  64  I  was starting to get a bit thin on the  front center  and  a  small area  on the  back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;  After  about 5 or 6  weeks  I  saw  new  hair. Was  easy  to  see  because my  hair is all white,  these  were  dark  hairs  growing.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s been about  12  weeks  and  still  going  strong.</li>
    <li> Amazing and really acting product. Makes a solution to a problem that I could not overcome a very long time.</li>
    <li> Not bad but not very effective too.</li>
    <li> Works great in rejuvanating hair follicles but when my husband stopped using it for 2 weeks, all the hair that came up had started falling off.</li>
    <li> Absolutely working, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Been using this for nearly 3 month on the front of my hairline to slow down my thinning hairline most likely brought on by my genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite it saying that it should only be used on the crown, my doctor informed me that it will work fine regardless of where you use it, and that the only reason they say not to use it on your hairline is that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, so rather than have people give it negative reviews for not working in the place they would want it to most, they tell you to keep it to the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 months, I noticed little hairs sprouting and now they are slowly growing out. I use it twice a day as advertised, but I find myself not needing to use the full 1 ML that the dropper indicates. If you try to use that much, most of it will just run off due to over saturation, so it&#x27;s just a waste. I might need that much if half my hair was gone already, but I&#x27;m not that bad yet (and promisingly, looks like I won&#x27;t get there with this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things you should take note of before use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It needs time to dry up and settle in. You want to use it at least an hour before you go or go to bed out unless you want that slimy look on your head or stains on your pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This stuff contains alcohol, so it will SEVERELY dry our your scalp. This can sometimes leads to periodic bouts EXCRUCIATING, INTENSE itching. Never has anything made me want to itch so badly in my entire life, and I still remember the time I had chicken pox. I felt like I wanted to run a rake through my head. This leads to Rogaine being an excellent test of your patience and focus. You don&#x27;t want to scratch as it may damage your now intensely dried out skin and easily lead to bleeding, which will be very painful as, I previously mentioned, this product contains ALCOHOL. I really don&#x27;t recommend using this if you have dry skin or scalp issues and urge you to visit a dermatologist before you decide to do so, unless you want to turn your scalp into a blazing inferno desert of itching and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If you use this in the evening, you absolutely need to wash your head with soap or some sort of cleanser in the morning before you apply your morning application. If you stack the morning application on top of the evening application without washing, when the product dries, you are going to have a very white looking chalky band on your head which I presume is the dead / dried skin from the night application being dried out even more by the morning application. Even worse, if you allow this to occur, you will not be able to wipe it off with just water. You&#x27;ll need to actually wash it off with soap or some sort of exfoliator, as merely rubbing your head with water (as I unfortunately learned) does nothing to remove this band. I can&#x27;t tell you how strange it was to explain why the majority of my forehead was covered in white chalk / dead skin to another employee. I ended up using hand soap in the office restroom to wash it off, and while it did work, it irritated my already dried out skin to an insane degree. I suggest that you carry some sort of moisturizer with you and use it a couple hours after you&#x27;ve applied the product when it is fully dry to keep your skin from drying out too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This product may lead to additional hair growth in other spots on your face, even if the product never reaches that area. A couple months after I started using it, I experienced some hair growth right under my eyes at the top of my cheek bones. Not a problem since it&#x27;s just an additional spot to shave in the morning, and may even be welcome if you are interested in fulfilling your human/werewolf fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. It&#x27;s not a miracle, it&#x27;s science. Sometimes science doesn&#x27;t work with your genetics. You need to try it for at least 3-5 months before you experience real results and whether you want to continue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It isn&#x27;t cheap. Once you start using this, youwill need to use it for life or you will lose all the hair you grew within about a years time of dropping use according to the instructions and other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an additional suggestion, if you are using this, I recommend picking up some 10,000 mg Biotin pills as well. Most people don&#x27;t get enough anyways, and it will help you with your skin and nails. If you check out the reviews, some people had some hair return to them just from using Biotin. Not saying you&#x27;ll experience the same results, but it couldn&#x27;t hurt, they are inexpensive, and have nothing but benefits.will need to use it for life or you will lose all the hair you grew within about a years time of dropping use according to the instructions and other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an additional suggestion, if you are using this, I recommend picking up some 10,000 mg Biotin pills as well.

    <li> I am a 24 year old and I have a receeding hairline. I thought this would help but it only made it worse! I used it for the full 3 months and I have less hair than I did before! It also made my scalp super sensitive and I had to change my shampoo conditioner and also my styling products! DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> Good price. The item itself not that good. It grows more hair in the areas you do not want it than in the areas you want it.&lt;br /&gt;I need to mention that it helps keep some hair on if you apply it regularly every single day. Very happy with the seller.</li>
    <li> I have been using the women&#x27;s Rogaine for a few years now and have seen good improvement; however, using it twice a day was a pain, so when they came out with the women&#x27;s foam that you only had to use once a day, I tried it.  But the foam is not as easy to apply as a liquid, so since the women&#x27;s foam is a 5% formula, as is the men&#x27;s liquid is a 5% formula I reckoned that I could try the men&#x27;s (after years of being warned against it by Rogaine).  So I ordered the men&#x27;s liquid and I have discovered that it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; than the women&#x27;s and therefore it doesn&#x27;t drip and run as easily.  The reason for the 4 stars, instead of 5, is that I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it&#x27;s as effective as the twice a day regimen.</li>
