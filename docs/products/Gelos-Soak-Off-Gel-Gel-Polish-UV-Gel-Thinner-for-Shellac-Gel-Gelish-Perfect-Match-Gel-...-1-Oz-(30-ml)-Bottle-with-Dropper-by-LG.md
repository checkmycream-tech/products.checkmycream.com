    <li> This gel polish  thinner works great! I would totally recommend this to anyone that uses gel polish.</li>
    <li> I used this on some of my Gelish polishes from the Spring in Bloom collection that are thick and goopy (A Petal For Your Thoughts, A Mint of Spring). It works as it should and has not affected the curing of the polish.</li>

    <li> I ordered the Gel&amp;ouml;s gel polish thinner and it works great for thinning the polish...BUT I have found it changes the color of the polish once cured. My mint green now is a deeper, darker green and my bright white now yellows, when it never used to before :( I am so disappointed in this product. I&#x27;m glad that it thins the product well so it applies easier and the cure times stays the same, but I don&#x27;t like that it changed the final colors.</li>
