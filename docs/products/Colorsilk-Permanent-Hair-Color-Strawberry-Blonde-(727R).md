### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This was the best strawberry blond hair dye ever.</li>
      <li>This is about the best Product for my hair color.</li>
      <li>I get the best results when I rinse it with a cup of vinegar and some water to remove any chemical stuff from the hair.</li>
      <li>I use this on my roots since they grow in darker than the rest of my hair by 1-2 levels, and this dye matches them up perfectly.</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>love it , best color for strawberry blondes, would order again.</li>
      <li>it looks good.</li>
      <li>If your roots are ashy or darker by 1-2 shades, they will lighten and warm up the color nicely.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this company took this color away from so many customers?</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought more than one, but now that we are through, there is no replenishment, as Revlon has discontinued this color.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
      <li>I will now be able to color my hair for about 1yr with out having to worry about finding another product.</li>
      <li>This is the best Strawberry Blonde permanent hair color I have found.  </li>
      <li>This is the best light red color I have found.</li>
      <li>Although I must say the L&#x27;Oreal color products have a GREAT conditioner, overall Colorsilk is better, safer and cheaper than all the rest.</li>
      <li>It is pleasant to use and not harsh;  </li>
      <li>The Strawberry Blonde shade is a great replacement color for their discontinued \\&quot;Light</li>
      <li>Since this, the most natural of red hair coloring, has disappeared from shelves was very happy to find it on the internet.  </li>
      <li>just right!  </li>
      <li>It aslo has a low amonia smell which is good and did&#x27;nt sting or burn when on head.</li>
      <li>And yet, it performs better than the professional dye I also have that costs $30+ per application.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t do my ends since they&#x27;re already the right color.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Hello Clairol Nice n Easy natural reddish blonde.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too vibrant like most other reds now available and it matches my original color, is easy to apply, leaves my hair silky soft, and it lasts a full 6 weeks.  </li>
      <li>When I use it it&#x27;s more red than blond though</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would call this more of a level 8 red gold, rather than level 7 after 2-3 shampoos.</li>
      <li>This haircolor is so pretty</li>
      <li>dye fades to a blonde, rather than a mousy brown like most and it doesn&#x27;t start out bozo-the-clown orange.  </li>
      <li>Covered most of white hairs.</li>
      <li>It seems just a tad frauduletnt to list a box of color 900% higher than would be in a drugstore.</li>
      <li>Sorry this has been discontinued from stores, but hope I can continue to get it online, since it&#x27;s the best color I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried in 15 years colors much much darker.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t destroy may hair, the conditioner it comes with does a good job of leaving it soft, and I get a lot of compliments on my hair color.</li>
      <li>And why it costs so much when it cost in the stores less than $5.00, I think people that are selling this product here and other places por that amount of money for $30.00 and plus, it is a shame, I do understand the people try to make money but charge more than $30.00 I will not pay even though I love the product,  I do beg to the Revlon company, to star making the product again.</li>
      <li>I am a natural redhead and used this product for the first time.</li>
      <li>It is an amazing color, one of the very few boxed hair colors I would recommend.</li>
      <li>I know how frustrated I was trying to find that perfect color after they discontinued it, and hope it helps.</li>
      <li>I searched for substitute combinations and finally found the right one.</li>
      <li>&quot; 53/5R.  Very natural looking.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you mix a box of Clairol SC8 sandy copper blonde and Clairol 8G/104 natural medium golden blonde together well, it is EXACTLY how the strawberry blonde color</li>
      <li>I use it to cover grey and it exactly matches my natural color.  </li>
      <li>Enhanced my natural strawberry blond hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m naturally ash blond</li>
      <li>Looks so natural.</li>
      <li>I am a natural strawberry-blonde and</li>
      <li>Colorsilk products are easy to use and the odor is neither strong nor unpleasant.  </li>
      <li>and this gives my curly hair a very natural red color.</li>
      <li>left my hair an unbelievably silky, natural light red.</li>
      <li>Some fading in the first week is inevitable, but from the first rinse to the next application it leaves a natural hue with subtle fade out over 6</li>
      <li>I received a response from Revlon customer support today that this shade is no longer being made and that there are no other colors similar to this shade.  </li>
      <li>only down side is that these boxes are regularly much cheaper in stores than on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have nothing bad to say of the color, my complaint is to the Revlon company, there lots of people using the best color for this selection of Revlon colorsilk, my comment is why?</li>
      <li>The only bad thing is COLORSILK discontinued it ( I dont know why it sold so good)</li>

<li> Love the color, hate that they discontinued it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m having trouble finding anything remotely close.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this same color for years with a couple failed attempts at switching to other dyes from other brands.  </li>
<li> keep hair in condition.&lt;br /&gt;getting hard to come by</li>
<li> The dye had hardly any noxious odors and the color</li>
<li> This price listed it ridiculous.</li>
<li> Not good for me, so came here and found some and bought them.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so sorry it was discontinued.</li>
<li> Anyways if you want to buy it on-line people are selling it very expensive because they know it got discontinued and were desperate to find it.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s almost impossible to find it in the stores.</li>
<li> greedy sellers still have stock, sell one pack for outrageous money, ridiculous and despicable, but I guess that is the law of a market that has no supplies.</li>
<li> Too bad I can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a natural redhead and used this product for the first time. Enhanced my natural strawberry blond hair. Covered most of white hairs. Looks so natural. Love it.Very hard to find a product for natural redheads. Thank you Revlon!!!!!</li>
    <li> FYI-- this is for 4 single applications, not 4 bundles of 3 boxes.  I wish that Revlon was not discontinuing this color.  I use it to cover grey and it exactly matches my natural color.  I hope they continue to make it or I can find a close replacement.</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say of the color, my complaint is to the Revlon company, there lots of people using the best color for this selection of Revlon colorsilk, my comment is why? this company took this color away from so many customers? And why it costs so much when it cost in the stores less than $5.00, I think people that are selling this product here and other places por that amount of money for $30.00 and plus, it is a shame, I do understand the people try to make money but charge more than $30.00 I will not pay even though I love the product,  I do beg to the Revlon company, to star making the product again.</li>
    <li> I cannot belive that they took this off the market.  This is the only strawberry blond hair color I&#x27;ve used that comes out just right!  Too bad I can&#x27;t find it anymore. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am a natural strawberry-blonde and this color from Revlon is the only thing I have used because it was my color so I never looked like I dyed my hair. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do but Revlon u need to bring back our 72/7r, some of us r stressing without it and I for one don&#x27;t want to change my hair color!.......I just used my LAST BOX.</li>
    <li> Love the color, hate that they discontinued it. I searched for substitute combinations and finally found the right one. If you mix a box of Clairol SC8 sandy copper blonde and Clairol 8G/104 natural medium golden blonde together well, it is EXACTLY how the strawberry blonde color was.&lt;br /&gt;I leave this review bcz I know how frustrated I was trying to find that perfect color after they discontinued it, and hope it helps. Good luck!</li>
    <li> love it , best color for strawberry blondes, would order again. keep hair in condition.&lt;br /&gt;getting hard to come by</li>
    <li> This is the best light red color I have found. But it&#x27;s almost impossible to find it in the stores. When you do it&#x27;s under 5 dollars. This price listed it ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This haircolor is so pretty, STRAWBERRY/BLOND. When I use it it&#x27;s more red than blond though but thats o.k. it looks good. It aslo has a low amonia smell which is good and did&#x27;nt sting or burn when on head. The only bad thing is COLORSILK discontinued it ( I dont know why it sold so good) Anyways if you want to buy it on-line people are selling it very expensive because they know it got discontinued and were desperate to find it.</li>
    <li> This is about the best Product for my hair color. I have not found another Product that does the job I want.</li>
    <li> This product manufacturer needs to be investigated. It seems just a tad frauduletnt to list a box of color 900% higher than would be in a drugstore. STOP, LOOK and READ. Someone sells it at this price because someone else buys it. Think about it.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought more than one, but now that we are through, there is no replenishment, as Revlon has discontinued this color.&lt;br /&gt;Some greedy sellers still have stock, sell one pack for outrageous money, ridiculous and despicable, but I guess that is the law of a market that has no supplies. These used to sell at Wal-Mart for about $ 4 a pack ...</li>
    <li> This was the best strawberry blond hair dye ever. The dye had hardly any noxious odors and the color left my hair an unbelievably silky, natural light red. I&#x27;m so sorry it was discontinued. I&#x27;m having trouble finding anything remotely close.</li>
    <li> Sorry this has been discontinued from stores, but hope I can continue to get it online, since it&#x27;s the best color I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m naturally ash blond and this gives my curly hair a very natural red color. I&#x27;ve used this same color for years with a couple failed attempts at switching to other dyes from other brands.  It doesn&#x27;t destroy may hair, the conditioner it comes with does a good job of leaving it soft, and I get a lot of compliments on my hair color.</li>
    <li> Colorsilk products are easy to use and the odor is neither strong nor unpleasant.  The Strawberry Blonde shade is a great replacement color for their discontinued \\&quot;Light Auburn\\&quot; 53/5R.  Very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update review as of 9/18/13, alas Revlon has again discontinued a light auburn color and I am so done with them.  Hello Clairol Nice n Easy natural reddish blonde.</li>
    <li> I have used Color Silk for over 20 years to turn my naturally dark brown hair into coppery auburn.  It is pleasant to use and not harsh;  I get the best results when I rinse it with a cup of vinegar and some water to remove any chemical stuff from the hair. It is an amazing color, one of the very few boxed hair colors I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this on my roots since they grow in darker than the rest of my hair by 1-2 levels, and this dye matches them up perfectly. I don&#x27;t do my ends since they&#x27;re already the right color.&lt;br /&gt;This dye fades to a blonde, rather than a mousy brown like most and it doesn&#x27;t start out bozo-the-clown orange.  Some fading in the first week is inevitable, but from the first rinse to the next application it leaves a natural hue with subtle fade out over 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would call this more of a level 8 red gold, rather than level 7 after 2-3 shampoos. Every other brand&#x27;s level 7 I&#x27;ve tried in 15 years colors much much darker.  If your roots are ashy or darker by 1-2 shades, they will lighten and warm up the color nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that these boxes are regularly much cheaper in stores than on Amazon. I but mine for around $3-4 a box regular price at the drugstore.  And yet, it performs better than the professional dye I also have that costs $30+ per application.</li>
    <li> This is the best Strawberry Blonde permanent hair color I have found.  It&#x27;s not too vibrant like most other reds now available and it matches my original color, is easy to apply, leaves my hair silky soft, and it lasts a full 6 weeks.  What more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> I received a response from Revlon customer support today that this shade is no longer being made and that there are no other colors similar to this shade.  Just to let people know who are looking for it that once it&#x27;s gone, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Although I must say the L&#x27;Oreal color products have a GREAT conditioner, overall Colorsilk is better, safer and cheaper than all the rest.</li>
    <li> Since this, the most natural of red hair coloring, has disappeared from shelves was very happy to find it on the internet.  Bought enough to last at least a half year.</li>
    <li> Could not find it on a shelf so contacted the manufacture and was told that they are no longer going to make this product. Not good for me, so came here and found some and bought them. I will now be able to color my hair for about 1yr with out having to worry about finding another product.</li>
