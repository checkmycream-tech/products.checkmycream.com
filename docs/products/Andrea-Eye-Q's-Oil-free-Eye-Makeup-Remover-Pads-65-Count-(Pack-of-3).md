<li> They burn my eyes and barely remove any makeup.</li>
<li> So I only use these now about every other day.</li>
<li> my only issue is that they are too small.</li>
<li> The pad is thicker than other brands I have used.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that I have to use a few wipes a day</li>
<li> It does what it says and I don&#x27;t have trouble with my eyes after use.</li>
<li> However, I noticed after 2 or 3 days it dried out the eyelids.  </li>
<li> I was pretty disappointed in these.</li>
<li> They remove makeup without any pressure on this delicate skin, plus they do not irritate my eyes.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, this one stings my eyes while removing make up and it takes a few scrubs to take off all make up.</li>
<li> Worst product ever.</li>

    <li> I wear contacts and do not have sensitive skin. These burn my eyes, a lot. They also don&#x27;t remove eyeliner or waterproof mascara very well. I was pretty disappointed in these. I will not repurchase or recommend them.</li>

    <li> I have sensitive skin and wear contacts. These are the only pads I will use. They aren&#x27;t greasy, they work great. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is the only product my wife will use. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of make up so using one pad for both eyes is enough and removes all of the waterproof mascara.  The pad is thicker than other brands I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years, discovered them by chance.  What makes them excellenct is that while they are very gentle on your skin they are extrememly effective at removing your makeup!</li>
    <li> Most reasonably priced and works well for heavy eye makeup removal, especially mascara that is waterproof.  Does not burn eyes but try not to get it in your eyes when cleaning your lids.</li>

    <li> Great value with 65 pads in each container. Pads work great and do not irritate my eyes, very convenient when travelling too!</li>

    <li> I finally decided to purchase this product after reading all of the great reviews. Unfortunately, this one stings my eyes while removing make up and it takes a few scrubs to take off all make up. The product may work well for others, but didn&#x27;t work for me. 3 Stars.</li>
    <li> Very gentle, effective eye makeup remover</li>
    <li> It does the job for removing eye makeup.  However, I noticed after 2 or 3 days it dried out the eyelids.  I stopped using them for a couple days and it returned to normal.  So I only use these now about every other day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Its handy to keep on the side of the vanity and works quickly without irritating my eyes.</li>
    <li> Takes makeup off very easily with out pulling skin.  Great price!  3 jars of 65 count per jar.  Do the math :)</li>
    <li> It removes makeup easily, does not irritate eyes like others do. my only issue is that they are too small. they&#x27;re about the size of a silver dollar. they would suffice if you only wear eye makeup, but if you wear foundation then you will easily use 4-5 pads.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  They quickly remove eye make-up, don&#x27;t bother my eyes or contacts, and the pads stay moist for months and remain just as effective as first opened.  It&#x27;s nice to have control of your eye make-up removal and be able to do it quickly.</li>
