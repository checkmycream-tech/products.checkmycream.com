    <li> I first tried this shampoo back in November 2011 and I noticed instant change in my hair that I bought 3 bottles at the same time. I had softer and shinier hair after the first couple of washes. It smells great too and the it stays for 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> I have since switched to a cleansing conditioner instead, but had used this shampoo for at least 2 or 3 years. I exercise almost every day and my hair came really clean with this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My only complaint is the bottles are a little small and didn&#x27;t seem to last long.  It smells wonderful and I love the way my hair feels after using it.</li>
    <li> My Wife thinks the shampoo is great.!!!!! She will probably order more when this is gone.  Thanks for the quick order.</li>
    <li> Have used this shampoo for 2 yrs and it&#x27;s not only a great product, it&#x27;s a great price! Cannot find it locally so I get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product smells great! My hair holds a great amount of curl and reacts well to heat when I use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair is with healthy light with easy, silky touch. Can be combed, not knotty. He has a disadvantage, that becomes greasy too soon. 3 I have to do the washing daily.</li>
    <li> Smell and performance of the product is great. It reminds me of well-made European cosmetics mostly because of the smell. It makes the hair shiny and it is easy to use hair iron afterwards. Good product!</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel soft , clean and lathers well with a very small amount.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice shampoo and conditioner, makes the hair super soft and really defined my natural curls.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it .</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It lathers great and smells good.  This was recommended for use when I bough the flat irons.  I also bought the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Shampoo us great but picture is misleading.  We got one bottle not two!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great. Don&#x27;t need a lot of shampoo to wash your hair. Leaves the hair nice and soft. I love the product</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaper to buy this at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every other day, I would love it do everyday,. but too,much.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> The product is just as good but the description is incorrect. It advertises a 7.1-ounce pack of 2 but instead I&#x27;ve got a 6.4 ounce pack of 2</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, it makes your hair feel extremely soft and manageable I just blow dry the flat iron, takes only 5 minutes to flat iron my hair and it is good for 2-3 days. I have the HerStyler flat iron and somehow the products were made to work with the hair appliances perfectly! Thank you so much for a great transaction! :)</li>
    <li> Horrible! left my hair greasy and not feeling clean at all. Tried to re sell it. No one bought it, so I tossed it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disapointed!!! this is not the real thing, its made in china. I can tell the difference big time! Sorry this is not the real thing!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have very thick, coarse hair and this is the olny shampoo I have used that makes it smooth and sleek. My beautitian was amazed at what good good condition my hair is always in even though I use a blowdryer and a flat iron on my hair. And the price from Amazon was a plus as well.</li>
    <li> Shampoo was awesome for heat damaged hair. It helps smooth and detangle hair. My hair had serious damage from using a hot iron and this product did a great job on it.</li>
    <li> bot the shampoo and the conditioner are very good for the hair, and a great price, I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> The product was excellent, I love it, absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for my hair and my friends hair, because the like to use it too.&lt;br /&gt;It makes it feel natural and soft and healthy (if that makes since).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the bottles are kind of small. I ordered two 7.1 ounce bottles from Amazon.com and recieved two 6.4 ounce bottles and they covered up the label where the ounce size is shown, but when i compared to the my old bottles i realized they were the same size. I peeled off the sticky paper and saw they sent me 6.4 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t mind it too much because I love the product so much. But next time, I would like to get what I actually paid for.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The shampoo cleans my hair without striping it (I have highlights).  It is not harsh, has a great lasting fragrance that you can smell all day, and leaves my hair clean as well as manageable.</li>
    <li> hair is always beautiful hydrated and shimmery. i love this shampoo and conditioner all herstyler products are wonderful including the flat irons and curling irons.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of the hair serum in this brand and just loved it so I thought I would try the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I have damaged and curly hair and this works great for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo/conditioner combo. When straightening my hair it makes it soft and less frizzy. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I prefer Herstyler product without the argon oil.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time.  It makes my hair feel so silky and clean.</li>
    <li> There have been some bad reviews regarding where the product is made and it being a good product looks like it matters where? So I wanted to ask where is the product made in? I bought a set at the kiosk at the mall and the serum I have is Made in Hong Kong and today is my first day using it and my hair feels soft and frizz free. But now what about the shampoo and conditioner? Where are your products that you say is great made in? Thanks</li>
