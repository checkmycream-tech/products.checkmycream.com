      <li>I can&#x27;t find this product in the stores any more, I&#x27;m allergic to the sun screen and it burns when you get it in your eyes.</li>

      <li>Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For anyone with sensitive skin, this great. I have been using it for many years and wouldn&#x27;t try any thing else.</li>
    <li> Was a gift to a lady friend of mine, she loves it</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is fragrance free, light, not greasy. I like it because it does not have sunscreen in it. The Olay in the stores around here all have fragrance or SPF. I prefer plain.</li>
    <li> This Moisturizer is very delicate.  Perfect for use following a facial peel.  I use it twice daily, morning and night.  Comparable to $30 moisturizers at a fraction of the cost.  I highly recommend  this product.</li>
    <li> I tend to break out from pretty much every kind of lotion or cream I put on my face - but I didn&#x27;t break out from this one.  It&#x27;s soothing and works well.  I need something like this during the winter when my skin feels so dry, although I skip it in the summer.  It&#x27;s very light so others may want to wear it in the summer as well as in the winter.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, and have been using it for years.  I can only buy it now on Amazon because it is no longer sold in any store.  They changed the formula to be \\&quot;complete\\&quot;  (with SPF) which I would appreciate except for the fact that now if I use the new version my face breaks out in hives...This is definitely a wonderful face cream for anyone with very sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s so light that your skin never is left feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I came to Amazon to purchase this because I loved the Sensitive Skin Active hydrating cream. However, that is not being made anymore. I purchased 4 bottles of  the lotion and opened and began using it. I realized that the bottle has a different label than the box. The bottle says \\&quot;Moisture Therapy Lotion\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t have the green band on the bottom.     It is still easy on the skin, but it is not nearly as hydrating. thenThe label on the back has just Loe and Chamomile listed and looks like the blurb on Olay&#x27;s website.  I see other websites sell this in a box also labeeled  \\&quot;Moisture Therapy Lotion\\&quot;    Don&#x27;t buy until Amazon and Olay sort this out.</li>
    <li> I have oily combination acne prone skin, that isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive.   I also use a strong lathering cleanser with sodium based detergent, that leaves my skin squeaky clean and tight. This moisturizer gives back moisture to my skin, and locks it in for the whole day, leaving my skin soft, and glowing. But this is a fairly light moisturizer so I don&#x27;t think it would work well for dryer skin.</li>
    <li> 15-20 years ago I had a skin condition through my eyebrows that left raised red areas and eyebrow dandruff. I saw a dermatologist who recommended this product.     After beginning use of this product the red dandruff condition disappeared. Now I apply it right after I shave (male). It is fragrance-free and does the job perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone who has had a similar skin condition.    Like others have stated I cannot find this in my area so I have to order it online. I&#x27;m just glad it is still available because I&#x27;ve tried knock-off products that just don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the only product I have found that works for me, I love it.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin &amp; this is the only moisturizer that works for my face.  I&#x27;m glad they kept this line because they have one that has the SPF &amp; my skin is rejecting that.</li>
    <li> I had always used the original. But this sensitive formula is perfect for my oily skin. Its perfect for all seasons.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of folks I had to go online to get this because they just don&#x27;t sell it anywhere in my neighborhood anymore.  I can barely put anything on my face without it breaking out all over the place, but this stuff is absolutely perfect, no perfume or oil and no irritation... I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  If your skin is super sensitive, and I mean super sensitive and you have not found a moisturizer for you, then try this.</li>
    <li> I have searched for a hydrating moisturizer for sensitive/acne prone skin and finaly found it. I have only been using the product for two months but I am very pleased with it. Not oily, yet it hydrates without breaking-out my skin. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> OK, it did not save my life, but it saved me from constantly being embarrassed of my face. I finally have the soft, much-less-flaky/scaly facial skin I have always wanted. I have tried numerous products on my flaky, peeling facial skin, and nothing has worked. Since I wear foundation, you were always able to tell I had it on because it would somehow gather around the dry skin flakes and make me look like some sort of alligator with a bad make-up job. My skin is almost always dry, especially in winter, and I could not find anything to work on it. So, I did a search on Amazon and went with cream with high ratings. I also have another cream being sent to me, but I doubt I will need it. THIS is all I will need. My skin looks 100% better, and it feels that way, too. There are still a few minor flakes on my cheeks (just a few!), but I have only been using it a few days. I am sure those will go away soon enough. I apply it in the morning only, under make-up. I am thinking of also trying it on my dry elbows and legs. LOVE this product. Thank you Olay!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 20 years. It has become very difficult to find in my area. Olay seems to have replaced it with \\&quot;complete\\&quot; senstive skin which I was very allergic to. The company made it right but only after much pressure on my part.      Olay Sensitive Skin Active moisturizer is by far the best on the market for faces with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This really is made for sensitive skin.  It does not burn or sting at all and works great on dry skin.</li>
    <li> I discovered this recently, though it is not a new product, when my regular face moisturizer was discontinued.  This product is lightweight, refreshing, moisturizing and absorbs into the skin, leaving no sticky residue. The Amazon price on these 2- 6 oz bottles is better than I had been paying at Walmart and Sams Club.  I highly recommend this to especially those who have sensitive skin and those who would apply this various times of the day.</li>
    <li> I use it after shower and shaving. It&#x27;s the one reasonably priced face cream that doesn&#x27;t cause any problems; it only does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday facial moisturizer. Far superior to all the newly improved Oil of Olay products. I have used this product for more than 15 years and hope they never discontinue this item.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years now and I havent found any other as good as this. It moisturizes but does not make skin oily. Its light and without any strong smell. The best face lotion ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Oil of Olay since my teenage years...I&#x27;m now 55 and have GREAT skin.  I love this sensitive skin version WITHOUT the SPF.  I have to order it by mail now.  It disappeared from store shelves a couple years ago.  But through Amazon, I get automatic shipments right when I need them.</li>
    <li> I thought I knew all the basic Olay products, but this was a great discovery. I&#x27;ve used the sensitive skin SPF 15 and 30 lotions for years; they were the only thing that didn&#x27;t start to make my skin sting after awhile. I was out of luck for night time. I&#x27;ve tried them all--Cetaphil, Aveeno, Neutrogena, Clinique--you name it. They would be OK for awhile and then I&#x27;d get the stinging. With this, there is absolutely no problem after six weeks. Sometimes it&#x27;s best to stick with the basics. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Pamper your sensitive face by using this Olay moisturizer.  No added perfumes or coloring to irritate, and as a bonus it costs less than fancier products sold in department store, door-to-door or cosmetics parties.  Do your skin (and pocketbook) a favor!</li>
    <li> After cluelessly exfoliating my face twice a day for approximately 3 months and suffering from HORRIBLE acne because of it I had almost lost hope in having the healthy, normal skin that I was born with back. I tried going back to what I used to use which was the clinique dramatically difference gel for combination skin but it turned out to be too strong. So then I decided to use baby lotions and still the same result, until I stumbled across this lotion. It SAVED my skin! it&#x27;s not only clearing my face, I can also notice that it looks healthier! and beleive me when I say a little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t have to use much of it to moisturize your face so this lotion will last for a long time. I would recomend this to anyone with sensitive skin ^.^</li>
    <li> I recently have started trying Olay products. I started using their sensitive skin face wash (blue bottle) and it works amazing. It does not dry out my sensitive/dry skin like most other face products I have tried. Since I had success with this face wash I thought I would try their moisturizer. I wanted something with no fragrance and no perfum since I have dry skin but am also sensitive/acne prone. My skin type is impossible to match with a great moisturizer. After using the Olay sensitive lotion, I noticed that my face and neck became extremely HOT! (\\&quot;flushing\\&quot;). I later went to a doctor and found out that some women tend to \\&quot;flush\\&quot; or get very hot skin/red skin when exposed to NIACINAMIDE (Niacin-a.k.a Vitamin B12). This is the 4th ingrediant in this product. This product also gave me instant pimples which is awful. I discontinued use and the problems stopped immediately. I am now using cetaphil brand lotion for dry sensitive skin in very sparing doses and vitamin E on my really dry patches and my problems have cleared wonderfully. If you have sensitive/acne prone/dry skin, AVOID AVOID AVOID. Instead, I recomend Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion in small doses around your dry areas.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and will continue to.&lt;br /&gt;It is the only moisturizer that works for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The ones with the SPF do not work for me, as I am sensitive to&lt;br /&gt;the SPF ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for keeping this available.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oil of Olay Beauty Fluid for Sensitive Skin for well over 15 years.  I have dry skin and must moisturize immediately after I shower.  It is non-greasy, absorbs quickly, light, and instantly moisturizes my face.  I never have break-outs or clogged pores (at least not due to this moisturizer.)  I have found other moisturizers to not absorb well, leaving a greasy sheen on my face, or to be too perfumy, or to discolor in the bottle over time.  Additionally I live in a very humid climate and I need moisturizer to absorb instantly, not linger on my skin and soon mix with sweat and have to be wiped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason you can buy regular Oil of Olay Beauty Fluid in the stores but not the type for Sensitive Skin, so I have to buy this product online.  I prefer the Sensitive Skin version because it has no scent - for some reason my husband doesn&#x27;t like the scent of regular Oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> This is a product my sister uses for her sensitive skin.  She has used this beauty fluid for years because it is gentle and fragrance free.  She couldn&#x27;t find it locally, so we checked Amazon and they had the best deal set up under their subscribe and save program with free shipping (no $25 minimum purchase required).  Since we could cancel the next order any time before it ships, we figured it was worth signing up for the program.     My sister found out that this product had been discontinued so she contacted the company to complain and was told by their customer service rep that it is still available.  She thinks the company may have reversed their decision to discontinue the product after receiving numerous complaints.  But we will see if it is available here again in a few months.    She can&#x27;t use the new formulation because the sunscreen additive irritates her skin.</li>
    <li> A great everyday hydrating moisturizer, used to use, but I am liking the Olay Pro-X products.  A good find, nice and light feeling, and great for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizing lotion! Leaves skin hydrated and no oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Just .....OK...I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again...Never been an....Olay fan...Olay Moisturizing Lotion, Sensitive Skin, 6-Ounce (Pack of 2)But thought I&#x27;d try this because of other reviews....for m Complex15 is much better I buy it on Amazon also.</li>
    <li> Good skin care basic item, affordable    But I find it boring and too light. not moisturzing enough for me and lack beneficial ingredients.</li>
    <li> Man this stuff is expensive, but these guys come through for me over and over, and I love this lotion.  No irritation to my skin or eyes at all.  Great product.</li>
    <li> So happy I found this on Amazon, I had thought it was no longer being produced!  The only thing for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore.  This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout or discolor my clothes since there isn&#x27;t any sunscreen in it. Sometimes simple is best!</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive. The olay moisturizing lotion for sensitive skin is perfect. It is light weight and perfume free. A little goes a long way too! One bottle will last me at least 4 months, thats with putting it on twice a day.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used it for many years!&lt;br /&gt;No greasy feeling! Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so I order it!</li>
    <li> I used to only put Olay on my face. Then one day I decided to try something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIG MISTAKE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve got 3 half full containers of other moisturizes that just don&#x27;t cut it, and I&#x27;m back on Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin, but this lotion does not have mineral oil which clogs my pores so I&#x27;m using it. Moisturizes well, absorbs fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never switching away again.</li>
    <li> Normally my skin is very low maintenance, but this winter was particularly harsh and dry and my skin started getting rough and reacting badly to lotions that had worked just fine before.    I&#x27;ve used other Olay products before and remembered being fond of them, so I decided to try this \\&quot;Sensitive Skin\\&quot; product which I had never used.  It is fantastic!  It isn&#x27;t greasy, nor is it so light that I have to apply several coats (which is a problem with other \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; products).  Within 3 days of using this my skin was smoothing out again.  And it smells fantastic.  I think it has almond oil or almond extract in it.  Whatever it is, I love the scent!</li>
    <li> --- product. -- have been using it for years. it&#x27;s a very simple product -- esp good for overnight if you just want something basic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product I use on my face each day!  I get a lot of compliments on my skin and I think it&#x27;s due to this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 15 years and I love it, not greasy and the sensitive skin version has no scent!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face cream because it is for sensitive skin and I buy it on Amazon because Target and others no longer sells it. This is not to be confused with Oil of Olay Complete for sensitive skin which is NOT the same formula!</li>
    <li> I am very pale and my skin is very sensitive.  I really needed this and I hadn&#x27;t been able to find it, till I found it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this product in the stores any more, I&#x27;m allergic to the sun screen and it burns when you get it in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I did not like the oily feeling of my skin after using this product, but I am very particular. My sister likes it</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Very light weight &amp; works really well on dry skin.  I used the SPF one before &amp; this cream is by far so much better.  I do wish it had SPF but maybe that&#x27;s what makes the other one not work so well.</li>
    <li> Whenever I use Olay, I get compliments on my skin!  I was using the pink Beauty Fluid, but over the years, I began to develop sensitivity to fragrance face products.  I&#x27;m so glad I found the sensitive skin version!  Wow!  This is what I had hoped Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion would be - but now I found it in Olay - at a fraction of the department store brand!  I liked Clinique&#x27;s DDML, but it felt heavy, stick, and greasy.  This Olay product is so lightweight, fragrance free, and just leaves my skin feeling silky and soft.  There is beneficial niacinamide and does not contain mineral oil or petrolatum (like the original).  Your skin feels clean and hydrated... and there is no trigger for my allergies.  Please always keep this sensitive skin version available and it&#x27;s perfect as is - so please don&#x27;t modify the ingredients!  Love this and will always use it to keep my skin glowing:)</li>
    <li> I have been using this since I was 22 years old. I am now 57 and still use it. It is not heavy and feels wonderful on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I use this cream every night before I go to sleep and i&#x27;ll have to say, my skin is vibrant and glowing. With the bundled value here at Amazon, this is a must have.... as stores often run out of this exact sensitive olay moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for YEARS and can&#x27;t find anything better.  Very Light and fragrance free.</li>
    <li> It does work as expected but there must be a topical anesthetic in the sensitive skin version.  It makes my lips numb when I get it on them, which I don&#x27;t like.  It also has a strange taste.  I won&#x27;t get this again.</li>
    <li> Really fantastic stuff. I don&#x27;t use anything else on my face. Love how gentle it is on my skin.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to all ladies.  I have used this formula for many years to keep my face hydrated, but not greasy.  I will be ordering it again because the brick and mortar stores in my area do not have this formula for sensitive skin.  TRY IT LADIES!!</li>
    <li> Classic, but works well as a general non scented moisturizer. It works different than other moisturizers. As someone who runs with dry skin and lives in a cold climate, sometimes you skin just needs something different. I find this works somewhere between Neutrogena Sensitive Skin and Lubraderm sensitive skin body lotion. Unlike Lubraderm, I can use this on my face with no problem, but will typically use the Neutrogena for a face application. Lubraderm is body only - hands, legs, etc. I&#x27;ll use Olay, also with no issues on my face.</li>
    <li> I love the product but ordered the 2 pack and only received one! Can&#x27;t find a phone number to straighten this out.</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin... can&#x27;t live without it!  I have extremely dry skin that is very sensitive to fragrance, dye, etc.  Too thick is a problem, not thick enough is another problem.  Oil of Olay is PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; light, absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I use this lotion after the Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion &amp; Peel system.</li>
    <li> its okay.  don&#x27;t really feel this does much good for my skin.  on flip side doesn&#x27;t harm it either.  use this in a pinch but stick to others products for most part.  good price here on amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have used this product since I was 14 years old. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Has aloe, unscented, and good for sensitive skin. It is also expensive, but it&#x27;s been my go-to face lotion for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I broke out nasty 8 months ago I tried expensive and organic creams and nothing worked. This one feels good and it&#x27;s actually clearing my skin with out drying.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have combination skin, but most moisturizers go on either too thin or too thick, and some of the ones with SPF flake when I put makeup over it. Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid works perfectly, it&#x27;s very hydrating but not at all thick--if you touch your skin after a minute, it&#x27;s totally smooth. And it smells pretty nice even without skin-irritating fragrance!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 25 years and NOTHING ELSE COMPARES NO MATTER HOW EXPENSIVE</li>
    <li> I use Olay Moisturizing Lotion for sensitive Skin after applying Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum. I will order again because I gave one bottle of this product to my nephew. The product is lightweight and does not leave any greasy feeling after application on my face.</li>
    <li> wonderful lotion ONLY product that does not burn my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> My Mom has been using Olay, Sensitive Skin for years.  She is 83 years old and has beautiful skin.  I order it for her online all the time, she cannot always find it in the store.</li>
    <li> The best lotion in the world!!!</li>
    <li> I very much like this product but find that it&#x27;s not always &amp;#34;in store&amp;#34;.  Thank you for your VERY LARGE store!!!  (I would rather not have to pay shipping...but what&#x27;s a guy going to do???)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK ladies...guys like to take care of their skin too!</li>
    <li> I usually forget to moisturize in the summer, but once winter hits and it&#x27;s cold,frozen and dry out, I need to. I love this, it&#x27;s very light and absorbs quickly. My skin feels softer without feeling like it&#x27;s got a coat of lotion on it. It makes all the difference in the world in those winter months.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product and price.  Received it even faster than I thought I would.  Wife real happy.</li>
    <li> I regularly purchased this product at Target and BiMart for $6.99 two years ago.   When OLAY went \\&quot;glam\\&quot; with fancy packaging, every Olay product skyrocketed in price.   Sorry, I&#x27;m not that stupid.</li>
    <li> I have used product this for years and years. For my skin type, the Sensitive Skin formula works best especially under makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product as I wished they offered it in stores</li>
    <li> Love this product, great service!</li>
    <li> So nice that the unscented is available online, I have only seen it one time in stores - love the product, but cannot live with the scented version. Although as some users have said, this product does seem to bother my upper lip which is usually flawless, so I skip that section of my face. The liquid just soaks in immediately; great alternating with Ponds cream;</li>
    <li> Love this product,  I have fair skin that tends to dry out in cold weather and constant washing.  After just two applications I noticed a positive difference in  my skin.  Dryness disappeared and my skin not only felt better but it provided my face with a healthy appearance which was noticed by other people.  Will definitely purchase again and again.  Also love they fact that it has UV protection.</li>
    <li> I have used it  both on my face and decollete for 4 years until I switched to Olay Age-defying  night cream (sensitive) for my facial use. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out at all, but I find it a lil too greasy for my face; however, I still use it for my decollete area at night time.</li>
    <li> Shocker- Olay has a good lotion, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight and smooth- a little goes a long way too. My husband swapped over from his regular lotion that helps prevent acne and this one works better on his skin- so now he&#x27;s taken over the lotion. It&#x27;s really nice, I recommend it for a nice, light, daytime lotion.</li>
    <li> this stuff helps your skin like no other. No scent for me, which i like! i might just buy another right now.]!</li>
    <li> Always an excellent product</li>
    <li> For several years, I&#x27;ve had horrible completely dry skin under my eyes.  So, bad that some days it looked like I had been punched in both eyes.  That bad.  I went to the dermatologist and, over the last several years, he prescribed two prescription medications.  The first one was a steroid.  It kind of worked, but the fact that it was a steroid prompted me to ask for something else.  The second medication worked alot better but it came along with bad potential side effects of its own.  And, it looked like I had vaseline under my eyes all the time.  So, just for the heck of it, I tried this product.  Wow.  If I use it every day, and several times a day when my skin is very dry, the symptoms completely go away!  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months, so I know it works.  So, I&#x27;m writing this review...</li>
    <li> This stuff always works well with my sensitive skin. Just a nice light non-greasy moisturizer for summer.</li>
    <li> Reduced marks on my back and chest.Moisturizes the skin uniformly .Love it</li>
    <li> This face moisturizer is delicate on my skin, goes on smooth, and has no offensive scent. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used Olay sensitive for many years and then could no longer get it at the store.  I was very happy when I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I thought I had purchased the original Oil of Olay, but was disappointed to receive Oil of Olay for sensitive skin.  My bad.  They arrived on time and as promised.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Can&#x27;t find this Olay for sensitive skin anywhere in my area are where I shop. I&#x27;ve used it for years. Not greasy and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. Get compliments on my 56 yr. old skin all the time. I don&#x27;t even need to wear makeup this lotion keeps my skin baby smooth.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;m 43 years old and haven&#x27;t really moisturized a day in my life because every moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I&#x27;ve tried most of them) breaks out my skin.  I have very sensitive skin that is also very acne prone.  I read all the positive reviews and decided to give the Olay Moisturizing Lotion, Sensitive Skin a try.  My skin isn&#x27;t overly dry.  I would consider it normal with moderate dryness occuring in the winter months.  This stuff works great!  It moisturized my skin, is not heavy or greasy, and best of all - is the ONLY moisturizer that did not break out my face whatsoever!  I love this stuff!  I highly recommend this for anyone, especially those with super sensitive, acne prone skin. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!  My skin looks and feels so much better!</li>
    <li> Olay.. a staple for all women who want to take care of their skin.  Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I looked and looked for this. No rash, moisture, and healthy looking face</li>
    <li> Great post shave lotion. Lite and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the only facial moisturizer that does not adversely affect my skin. Amazon is the only place I can purchase Oil Of Olay Sensitive Skin as my local drugstores do not carry the product</li>
    <li> This versIon has no SPF which i like for night use.  It&#x27;s gentle to use close to your eyes and won&#x27;t cause them to water.  My skin feels and looks great.  For day use in the sun I use the SPF version, which is also very gentle.</li>
    <li> i like this moisturizer, its soaks well into skin but on my t-zone I still feel dry flasks... so its good for people who are just looking for a very light moisturizer and nothing more.</li>
    <li> works great as long as skin is not over dry. no smelly perfume scent. would recommend to anyone. wish it was made in a man version.</li>
    <li> It is impossible to find a moiturizing lotion without SPF. Because someone decided that SPF is a great anti-aging ingredient, it is put into all facial products. This is the only product I can use and it is no longer being sold in stores. I don&#x27;t know what I will do when Amazon runs out.</li>
    <li> I first tried the one with SPF because it would have been better but it felt sticky but this one feels better on the skin.</li>
    <li> All the great reviews gave me high hopes for this product but after using it daily for several weeks I found it didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay products and have tried many different kinds over the years.  I have been using their moisturizers for years and love that they have them in make-up now too.  This moisturizer works great under my make-up.  I have fair skin so the SPF is great year round. Try the Olay CC Creme - Total Effects with Moisturizer too! Its my current favorite for make-up and works well with the extra moisturizing lotion underneath.  I was previously buying this lotion in a two pack from BJs but this is an even better deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for many years, and have been happy with it - the only thing I wanted to call out here is that the version that I&#x27;ve bought in the store most recently had an SPF rating of 15 clearly labeled on the package and bottle - this product has neither.  I don&#x27;t know if they stopped selling the other version with the SPF rating, or if Olay offers different versions?  Apart from that, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer is fantastic for it. I have never had a bad reaction It leaves my face feeling so fresh and it&#x27;s very light with a gentle scent. Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried, hands down.</li>
    <li> I have used at least 50 different creams for my face but none of them made any difference on my skin. I have a very very sensitive skin and can not even use any kind of blusher ! I paid for the previous creams at least 80$-90$  and they were useless. I put this cream on my face two nights ago and then in the morning i went to work. All of my friends were asking me what was different on my face ! It is the best cream for a great price !</li>
    <li> Works well, moisturizes, and definitely leaves less greasy residue (difference especially noticeable on the nose) compared to Neutrogena oil-free moisture for sensitive skin, my old product.</li>
    <li> My wife prefers Olay over Estee Lauder/ Clinque  and all these other high priced creams and lotions.  She prefers to order them from Amazon, but AMAZON hardly keep a sufficent stock to satify their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET with it AMAZON!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this original version in the stores any more - and I can&#x27;t use the ones with all the dyes, scents, and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for still having it available online.  I have used this for years - love it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that is good for very acne prone skin like mine and this certainly did not cause me any acne breakouts, it&#x27;s very gentle ...sadly it&#x27;s also a weak moisturizer, it just does not moisturize that well, I am still having dry skin , I use Benzole Peroxide to prevent acne breakout and wanted something to counter the drying effects of the BP, this isn&#x27;t strong enough. If you just have normal dry skin it may work for you.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  I like it for my sensitive skin and sensitive smell.  No odor and lightweight without leaving a heavy residue but does a nice job protecting my skin.  Love the spf one as well for summer days!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years &amp; love that it&#x27;s a light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t clog pores and that it can also remove eye makeup. Lately I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it in stores, but after much searching &amp; a phone call to the company, I learned the original product was discontinued in 2010. The original was called Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid for Sensitive Skin. It appears to be the same product as this, or at least works the same. I ordered a 5-year supply, just in case it disappears again.</li>
    <li> I love this basic moisturizer all year long. It is light enough for the hot Summer nights and I can double up and slather it thick on my face during dry Winter nights. Even when I slather it on like a mask, it never clogged my pores or make me break out. I go through bottles of these like nobody&#x27;s business because I slather this stuff on my neck, decollete, shoulders and arms as well. In the morning, my face looks plumpy and translucent looking.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing product for anyone with sensitive skin It works great under makeup or on its own. I use it before bed and again in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay lotion for years and I love it.  It is the only lotion I have used on my face and very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion after shower and it keeps face moisturized all day. It is light and does not make my face look oily. And the price on Amazon is great for the pack of two!</li>
    <li> I wish this was available in stores. I never see it in stores anymore, just the SPF15 which burns my sensitive skin. I have used this for years, mainly during winter when it&#x27;s dry, with a bit of Trader Joe&#x27;s aloe. Great to use as a night cream because it&#x27;s not as heavy.</li>
    <li> Only place I can find is Amazon!!!! Get a few at one time.  Great product Non-greasy, hydrates my sensitive skin!!! Love it :)</li>
    <li> This product did not cause me to break-out, but I just didn&#x27;t care for it as it didnt do anything special for my skin .</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay for sensative skin. It is the only moisturizer I have found that does not irritate my face.</li>
    <li> I have used this since I was a teenager.  I am now 68 and still use it.  I moved to California from Missouri and this has helped with the dryness here.</li>
    <li> [ have lived 75 years and my skin shows it. Olay moisturizing lotion does not set on my skin like a blob of butter. like some others Know for the sensitive part, my grandson was using a popular brand of products to fight acne,it had bleach in it and it burned his skin, Grandmas Olay sensitive skin did the trick.know as a man i am sure he would not admit using grandmas lotion.but it worked and saved his face and mine</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer for sensitive skin. i use it at night and under make-up, or at home without make-up!</li>
    <li> Love it. Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, hope they never change it, feels so good on my skin and I love that it is FRAGRANCE FREE!!!!</li>
    <li> This has become so hard to find in stores, but I have to have it because all the other products seem to have SPF and perfume in them and that stuff makes me break out in tiny pimples all over my face. So if you are having problems with SPF this is the stuff to get. Oh and by the way I have been using it since I was 14 years old, I am now 57 and am told what nice skin I have so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the Oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> For about a year I was looking around for a moisturizer for my sensitive, combination skin. I even purchased lotions that were $30-$100 and honestly none of them perform as well as this Olay moisturizing lotion for sensitive skin. This hydrates my skin and welcomed back the health glow I lost. My skin feels great, looks great and isn&#x27;t a runny oily mess. People have commented how great my skin looks now and I&#x27;m really happy. This is very affordable and it WORKS!. I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that is lacks SPF</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and yes, I get dry skin.  I hate all the perfume smelling lotions out there.  This lotion has almost no scent, and is a very good moisturizer.  This is great for daily use.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and remembered my Mom using this. She has beautiful skin, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It does not irritate; it&#x27;s non-greasy and light. I really like it!</li>
    <li> This is great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been brand loyal to Olay since some time now.  I&#x27;ve used the hydrating lotion and cream every winter.  This year I decided to try this lotion.  It&#x27;s thicker than the hydrating lotion, and so it works out great for the winters.  I bought the hydrating cream but I won&#x27;t be needing it now.</li>
    <li> Good cream, very light and adds some moist to face, better than nothing, wish is more moister but it is as good as light cream for sensitive skin can be, you can&#x27;t find cream for sensitive skin much anymore,I would use it again,  plus no added bad chemical for UV protection specially if you are using it inside your home and not under the sun, or you are using it after sun hours</li>
    <li> I have searched far and wide (and wasted a lot of money) in search of the &amp;#34;perfect moisturizer.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t exist, but this (for me) is as close as it gets. It doesn&#x27;t smell (no dyes or perfumes), it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy, dirty, or &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; feeling, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out (a big factor for me), and it moisturizes pretty well. This product does not contain any type of sunscreen, as many facial moisturizers do. However, for me this is a benefit, as I have NEVER been able to find a good moisturizer that includes sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily and cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and years until it became hard to find in the local stores. I am so glad that you have it, I will definately be ordering it again.</li>
