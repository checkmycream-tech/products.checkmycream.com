      <li>I really love this product!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for about 4 months and the results are amazing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>Just wasn&#x27;t effective in lightening the razor bump scars.</li>
      <li>So far the best spot brightener I have used.  </li>
      <li>works great evens out skin tones and lightens dark spots best product I have ever used</li>
      <li>The pump bottle is so very handy for dispensing just the right amount needed.  </li>
      <li>It really brightens your skin and leaves you with a beautiful glow.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this line and swear by the results.</li>
      <li>I love the price I paid.</li>
      <li>Much better price then at the doctor&#x27;s office</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I have been using my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; products for more than 15 years.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin (which I do), it does burn and you will see peeling, but the results are great.  </li>
      <li>Very much lighter than the product purchased from dermatologist, and seemingly not as effective.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous product.  </li>
      <li>Soft and feels good.</li>
      <li>I achieved a more even skin tone after the first bottle...love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a month into and haven&#x27;t seen much yet, glad at this point I didn&#x27;t buy at the 125.00 from my dermatologist.</li>
      <li>A great product for lightening and removing any brown spots due to sun exposure.  </li>
      <li>My face has never looked better, glowed more, or had such elasticity.</li>
      <li>It quickly disappeared once I began Lytera.  </li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>My dermatologist sells this in his offices but at a higher price than I got it for at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t afford the spas inventory but found the exact product here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>been using for a few months, dont see a huge difference, but have many friends that swear by it and skin takes time..</li>
      <li>I certainly will be purchasing this again and again because it works for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I wanted so much to like this product.  </li>
      <li>I bought the whole line after having been given samples.</li>
      <li>There is too much hype of this product.&lt;br /&gt;No results after 4 weeks of use&lt;br /&gt;Price is way too high.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My lines and uneven tone are both diminishing and the change has been more than exciting.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s easy to use &amp; sinks into the skin.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This is safe to use everyday.</li>
      <li>So far it is a nice cream, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it&#x27;s going to work for me long term.  </li>
      <li>Per the manufacturer this item should be a caramel color; product received was much lighter, almost yellow.</li>
      <li>My skin has never felt or looked better since using the LYTERA Skin Brightening Complex.  </li>
      <li>I had a quarter size brown spot on one check and it is completely gone.  </li>
      <li>I like using it very much, but I am not sure how much of a difference it ;makes.</li>

<li> It was very expensive through them (over 100 dollars)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Awesome.  Makes it worse at first cause it draws the color out. But soon you will have beautiful skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a month into and haven&#x27;t seen much yet, glad at this point I didn&#x27;t buy at the 125.00 from my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> My plastic surgeon recommended this.  I use it every day. Although I can&#x27;t tell yet if it&#x27;s working since its only been about 6 weeks.  But my friends swear by it.  And the price here is less than the doctors office.</li>
    <li> After 1 year of use, I didn&#x27;t notice a change in skin</li>
    <li> I like using it very much, but I am not sure how much of a difference it ;makes.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  If you use it twice a day, every day, you should see dramatic results as I did.  I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for about 4 months and the results are amazing.  I get compliments on my youthful skin tone often.  I really love this product!  I have to think that any unhappy users just didn&#x27;t stick with it long enough or their damage is just too much for a topical product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week. I&#x27;m using it with Retinol Skin Complex 0.5. It has already taken improved the redness and texture of my acne scars. It&#x27;s amazing. Some of the negative reviews seem to be from people who bought it from sketchy sellers. I checked the rating of my seller and had no problems with the product being out dated or tampered with. If buying it from my dermatologist for $125 were my only option, I&#x27;d do it.</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt or looked better since using the LYTERA Skin Brightening Complex.  My dermatologist sells this in his offices but at a higher price than I got it for at Amazon.  I certainly will be purchasing this again and again because it works for my skin.  The pump bottle is so very handy for dispensing just the right amount needed.  You might want to check this out yourself from Amazon. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was a hard sell on changing my skin care regiment. I have been using my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; products for more than 15 years. I went to a spa and had a facial along with a consultation to improve my skins condition now being in my 40&#x27;s. I couldn&#x27;t afford the spas inventory but found the exact product here on Amazon. I bought the whole line after having been given samples. My face has never looked better, glowed more, or had such elasticity. I am in love with this line and swear by the results. The Vit C and E lotion is a must! So silky and so hydrating. My lines and uneven tone are both diminishing and the change has been more than exciting. I started to get compliments at work a week after using.  :)</li>
    <li> The spa/laser surgery center I go to suggested I try LYTERA to lighten sun damage and acne scars. It was very expensive through them (over 100 dollars) but I was and still am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I am a black female and I used this entire tube at the recommendation of my derm. I have not noticed a difference in my hyper-pigmentation.</li>
    <li> been using for a few months, dont see a huge difference, but have many friends that swear by it and skin takes time..so i iwll keep using this product</li>
    <li> It works slowly, but like all these products, it must be coupled with sun block and laser treatments. If you miss a day of sunblock, the age spots will try to come back</li>
    <li> I gave up, took too long to see any results. Found the tint of the cream too yellow. Not for me</li>
    <li> Pricey product but it&#x27;s easy to use &amp; sinks into the skin.  I use it in the morning under my makeup &amp; again at night before I go to bed.  Havent decided if I will reorder but I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and has a wonderful smell- unlike most lightening creams. A little goes a long way. I really like it!</li>
    <li> Great product. It really brightens your skin and leaves you with a beautiful glow. This product will reduce the appearance of dark spots and freckles on your face.</li>
    <li> I wanted so much to like this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and I don&#x27;t see any change.  In fact, I find my skin is very dry when I use it.</li>
    <li> Have been using for two months and using sunscreen religiously but unfortunately have noticed no discernible lightening. My Dr. Recommended and I was so hoping it would do the trick but that hasn&#x27;t been my experience 😕</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product. I use it twice daily as I have for about 1 1/2 years.</li>
    <li> Appeared to be &amp;#34;gray market&amp;#34; product. Very much lighter than the product purchased from dermatologist, and seemingly not as effective. Per the manufacturer this item should be a caramel color; product received was much lighter, almost yellow. Contacted the seller and was given a prompt return authorization, although subject to a 15% restocking charge.</li>
    <li> This product makes blemishes darker</li>
    <li> Used this product before .this is a great price. skin looked firmer,more even tone , but dont expect any miracles .</li>
    <li> It takes time to see the outcome. Soft and feels good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two of the bottles from Amazon. The product is the same as that which I got from my Doctor.  When I make another Amazon order, I&#x27;ll advise if either of the bottles are faulty.  If so, I will send them back.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> A great product for lightening and removing any brown spots due to sun exposure.  If you have sensitive skin (which I do), it does burn and you will see peeling, but the results are great.  I now just use it for any spot that I see.  I had a quarter size brown spot on one check and it is completely gone.  Evens out your skin tone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product . Brightening the skin after using 2 months.</li>
    <li> So far it is a nice cream, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it&#x27;s going to work for me long term.  Much better price then at the doctor&#x27;s office, I know that.</li>
    <li> It feels like it works well.&lt;br /&gt;U need to use this item for at least couple month, if not u</li>
    <li> I achieved a more even skin tone after the first bottle...love this product.</li>
    <li> I love the price I paid. My dermatologist charges $130 for the same product</li>
    <li> There is too much hype of this product.&lt;br /&gt;No results after 4 weeks of use&lt;br /&gt;Price is way too high.&lt;br /&gt;In simple I feel waste of MONEY.</li>
    <li> Just wasn&#x27;t effective in lightening the razor bump scars.</li>
    <li> So far the best spot brightener I have used.  Takes several months to see results</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product.  For years I used Obagi products and always had redness.  It quickly disappeared once I began Lytera.  My skin looks great!</li>
    <li> My brown sun spots are gradually fading. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> This product lightens the dark spots that I have on my face.  It also moisturizes my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this production.</li>
    <li> Arrived within great time. Great product.</li>
    <li> works great evens out skin tones and lightens dark spots best product I have ever used</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I used to buy this directly from my dermatologist for  $125 but found it on Amazon for less. The delivery was prompt, and the product is as described. I use this 2 x a day to maintain the work I have done with the dermatologist(prior chemical peel) to remove the dark spots from sun damage. This is safe to use everyday. The down side is that SkinMedica products are expensive.</li>
