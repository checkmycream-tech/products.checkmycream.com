<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way. Very moisturizing. But disappointed--contains soy. I read all my labels for my supplements and facial/body products to not have soy or soy derivatives like so many products with Vitamin E listed in the ingredient list.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice oil.  It absorbs well and is light.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Great product works wonders on all skin types.</li>
    <li> The oil feels really amazing. It absorbs so well. I have applied this to my face &amp; body,it feels &amp; works great. Since this Oil leaves my skin very moisturize, I will recommend this to my family &amp; friends.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of this product but as I began to use it I noticed that my skin was so much softer and I could actually feel it tightening my loose skin. I have also used it on my sons eczema and it had reduced it significantly to where he is not itchy his skin all the time!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product ...... Very nourishing for my face...... I will definitely order again....</li>
    <li> It good product let us hair telex after shampoo and feel so soft</li>
    <li> Great oil it sinks right into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a oily or tacky after feel. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I was pleased at how quickly this absorbs into the skin and how nourished your skin feels after using it! Its a lifesaver, especially for dry winter skin!  It does have a slight smell when you are applying it, it smells very natural and slightly nutty - I like how there are no added fragrances to it.  My skin is pretty sensitive and I&#x27;ve gotten rashes from trying new products out before, I&#x27;m glad to say there was no reaction after using this oil blend. I love how many benefits this product has and look forward to continuing to use it!</li>
    <li> What a great oil! It is very hydrating and does NOT leave an oily residue. Perfect for winter skin!!!</li>
    <li> I have been following Emu oil for awhile and learned that Emu oil has wonderful skin care benefits. It can be used as a moisturizer and as a skin nourishing treatment. Skin conditions tend to respond well to the anti-inflammatory properties which soothe the skin and help relieve inflammation and its very hypo-allergenic and to have an extremely high purity level. That all sounds great but the cost can get out of control if you don&#x27;t shop around and shop smart! Then comes GreatFull Skin&#x27;s line. You get all of the benefits with a fraction of the cost. The oil works very well and has reduced fine lines in my mothers forehead and also under her eyes. You just need a very small amount of this oil and you work it into the skin. It takes about 3 days before you begin to notice results but once you do you will be very happy.</li>
    <li> EMU-lator oil by GreatFull Skin is superb for dry skin, especially in the winter. It is also good for your hair and scalp. My wife and I are definitely ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been undergoing topical chemotherapy on my face due to a history of skin cancers and much sun damage.  This results in red, irritated, lession and inflamed skin as the pre cancerous skin cells die off and the skin begins to heal.  The EMUlator oil has been a God send to my sore face, soothing the itchiness and moisturizing my dry and dead skin WITHOUT causing blemishes.  Let me repeat, WITHOUT making me break out!!  I have adult acne from the sun damage to my skin and could not use moisturizers without it getting worse.  I decided to try this oil blend because I was desperately worried about how my face was going to heal from the chemical onslaught it was experiencing.  Not only has my skin healed, it is soft and blemish free.  Oh, another thing that seems improbable...my scarring and facial lines are less noticeable!!</li>
    <li> This oil has a dropper in it. i used this on my hair and hands and made them soft. i don&#x27;t really like the smell but ill use it anyways because it helps make my hair and skin soft and moisturized. I added more moisture to may hair and i can tell my hair likes it because of the added shine and softness. Im also going to use this on stretch marks and scars because it says it ideal for those uses to.</li>
    <li> This is a nice oil but I wish it absorbed better. It only takes a small amount as this is such a rich oil.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! I UAE with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> I happily try all of GreatFull Skin&#x27;s products.  I received the product promptly and have fell in love with it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! I have been using it on dry spots on my face and neck. I wake up in the morning to my skin feeling super soft. It seems to have healing properties as well :) I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> Loved it so much I bought it again. My skin feels great. Soft and smooth. I also use it on my hands at night and it leaves them soft.</li>
    <li> I use this for my hair. It is very moisturizing and could possibly be used a good pre-product</li>
    <li> I love this oil!!!  It applies more like a serum than an oil, and dried beautifully!! I would purchase again, although I feel as if this bottle will go a long way, as it only takes a little bit.</li>
    <li> I love the mix of the oils. I was a bit hesitant in reading the ingredients,  hoping I would not have an allergic reaction to any one, but I&#x27;ve not had any problems. A little goes a VERY long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos!</li>
    <li> It is very moisturizing and has helped tremendously with my dry skin this winter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m beyond impressed with the quality of this emulator oil! I have problematic skin and have used this for the past two weeks. I&#x27;ve seen scarring visibly decrease and my skin is much softer! It&#x27;s beyond worth giving this product a chance! And the customer service this company provides is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 9 days now and I do notice that acne scar is lighter and my skin feels really nourish. Absorbs quickly, there&#x27;s not much smell, I assume this is what makes it natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this EMU-lator Oil. It really moisturizes my skin without leaving it feeling or looking greasy. It works wonderful on my sensitive skin and has a pleasant light scent to it. I will continue to use this one :)</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I have found this a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Love this company and all of its products!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my skin after I&#x27;ve been out in the sun all day! Thank-you!</li>
    <li> Goes on slippery smooth and absorbs quickly. I use it on my hands, which are used and abused, and it makes my skin look younger and softer.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Makes my skin feel so soft. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> This oil feels amazing on my skin. Inusually have to be careful when applying oilw to my face but this is so light weight not greasy at all. My complexion is already brighter. I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This is ultra hydrating!!  I have been using this oil as a scar massage from a recent surgery.  It goes on silky and obsorbs well.  It does leave a slight residue on the skin.  There is really no scent to the oil so it shouldn&#x27;t bother scent sensitive persons.  It has a dropper for administration that works well.  I have used this oil over the top of areas that I have rubbed on essential oils and it works as a carrier.  It is thicker than most of my other oils such as grapeseed or jojoba.  I have used this on deeper lines on my face and they seem to be softening some.  I would purchase this one again.  A very small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I have tried that has shown results in only 4 uses. Feels great, absorbs quick, no burning, no bad smells, just all good. Try it you wont be disappointed. After applying to face, rub hands together helps with dry hands and then run fingers through your hair. its amazing what you will see in a very short time. Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product,it really works on me.</li>
    <li> so far used for few days, and feels good no side effect.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin silky smooth, with a lovely glow.  It takes a bit longer to soak in than a simple oil, but it has been doing a great job of reducing fine lines on my forehead.  The product is a light orange color, but doesn&#x27;t make my skin look orange - just bright and healthy.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing !!!</li>
    <li> Awesome...this is perfect for my normally dry face.would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Thank you for an amazing deal!</li>
    <li> It is a very smooth oil that moisturizes even the driest skin areas and makes them soft. This is a very high quality product with amazing results on dry skin. Thanks for such a wonderful product. I will use over and over again.</li>
    <li> My cuticles and nails are so dry due to constant hand washing and this product has helped me more than the entire row of cuticle and nail moisturizing products I have in my bathroom cabinet.  Small enough to carry with me during the day . Absorbs nicely without the strong odor that emu oils I have used in the past seemed to have. Also use on my toes and the last time I had a pedicure they remarked that the skin around my toes looked great,  Seems to work on any rough patches. This is definitely going to save me money in the long run because I can buy just one product instead of spending money trying dozens.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to EmuOil for anyone opposed! It was shipped quickly and customer service has been awesome! The dropper makes wasting impossible. It absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Makes my nails and cuticles feel amazing. Love this company! Want to try their vitamin e oil next!!</li>
    <li> Love this oil and the blend they use, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy at all.  Helps with dry patches!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. I have used it for my hair, nails, and face. My skin drinks it in. My nails and hair have never looked better. My 21 year old son told me he could tell I had done something different. He said I don&#x27;t know what you have done but you could pass for my age. I would recommend to and one at any age. This is such a great product.</li>
    <li> love this stuff feels so good</li>
    <li> plan on using this to make some creams/scrubs.. will update how they turn out!!</li>
    <li> I tried the oil on my face today and it doesn&#x27;t have too much of the oil feeling which I was afraid of. Will give it a try for well to see if there is any changes on my skin but as for now, great deal and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Probably  too soon to give an informed review but what I see  so far I like</li>
    <li> Excelent!!! Love it 👍</li>
    <li> wonderful!! MOISTERIZING AND ABSORBS WELL-RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Good quality and great for my daily beauty regiment.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for new oils to use with my essential oils for my body. I started added Emu-lator oil to my rose hip oils for my face. I am 58 years old and have always bought the best products for my skin and try to buy as natural product as I can. This is a must have for anyone that cares about using natural products. You will love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works as advertised and I noticed a difference on my face right away. In fact I had to take&lt;br /&gt;a double take in the mirror. After a couple of days of trying it out, I started using it twice a day as recommended,&lt;br /&gt;for better results. I have sensitive skin and need to be careful with what I use because some ingredients may&lt;br /&gt;cause irritation. I have not had any problems at all from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product to use for dry, frizzy hair as well, and a little does goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  It got rid of my horrible dry skin from this extremely dry weather!</li>
    <li> It has a weird smell to it and so far I have not seen any dramatic changes but probably would if I keep using it. If I do I will upgrade my review.</li>
    <li> I put this on my face and on my stretch marks on my stomach. Have noticed reduction in redness and feel significant smoothness in my face.</li>
    <li> Great oil.  I use this in my blends &amp; it seems to work as needd.</li>
    <li> This emu oil soaks right l put om my face and feel smoothness definitele recomenf.</li>
    <li> I use the EMU-lator Oil on just my eyes.  In just a week I have already noticed a slight decrease in fine lines and dryness.  My dark circles are also less visible, a benefit I didn&#x27;t expect but greatly welcome.  I only use a couple drops a day so the bottle will last me forever.  It is a great addition to my beauty routine.  Thank-you.</li>
    <li> First, the main reason for a 4 star review is I have only been using this product for one week. . .So far am loving the oil!

    <li> My skin is very sensitive and dry. This product really solves my skin problem.</li>
    <li> This EMU-lator oil is pretty amazing stuff!  I have been using it nightly on my face and on other parts of my skin that are severely in need of nourishment.  I can tell a huge difference already.  The spots on my face are much smoother and moisturized than before.  I also try to leave some on my cuticles each evening to really let my cuticles soak in some of this good stuff too.  I am seeing a big difference in my cuticles as well.  I highly recommend this oil!  It has helped me so much!</li>

    <li> I found this oil soaked in rather quickly when applied to my very dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t have any discernible odor.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! My skin gets really flaky and itchy in the winter. After using this for a week, most of the flakiness is gone along with the itching. I wish I would have started early on in the winter and maybe I could have prevented this altogether.</li>
    <li> If it was organic this would be the perfect oil! otherwise no complaints!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use it daily!</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful ... Not oily ... But it&#x27;s thick and looks like Orange Juice Pulp... Not what I expected</li>
    <li> I love this emu oil. It works so well on my face at night. My daughter also uses this to treat her eczema what an amazing transformation!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.  It made my face sticky feeling</li>
