<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> item was as described but wrong size</li>
    <li> My skin broke out in a rash after using this product for about a week.  I found the product to be too harsh for my skin.  I have discontinued using it.  I will not order it again.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. very smooth skin</li>
    <li> Avon Anew is great moisturizer for me!!! My agent passed away. I stopped using it and tried something else.  WIth in a very short amount of time I became desperate to find the Anew face cream so I turned to Amazon!  GREAT move, the product arrived and my skin thanked me for going back to Anew!  the product is amazing, I get comments that people can not believe my age, it truly does make me look younger.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my product, and it was shipped quicker than expected. I will buy my ANEW product here again because it save me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Have used this for 15 years and swear by it. I am 65 and people ever day tell me I look 50</li>
    <li> BarbwireRose3 took my order on Nov.7, took my money on Nov.15. Today is Nov.22 and BarbwireRose3 has not yet even shipped my purchase!!! I have written 3 emails with NO REPLY from BarbwireRose3.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like or dislike this product.  I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s &amp; tried this when I noticed some softening along my jawline however, it didn&#x27;t make any noticeable difference.  It a fine lightweight moisturizer &amp; I like the smell but there is nothing exceptional about it &amp; it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does.  At least, it didn&#x27;t for me</li>
    <li> I am 60 and try just about everything that comes along.  this Avon Anew Clinical Therafirm is simply sumptious.  It tightens the skin and takes years off your looks......... everywhere you put it.  I put it on my face and neck daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 years now and I love it. I can really see a difference in my slightly sagging skin. I am 55 years old and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Glad I can purchase it at amazon for such a good price. Would recommend to all who are in need of a little help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Anew for years. Was happy to get it at the price I paid. Product was packaged with care.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, try going a week with out it and you will see a difference it makes.  I can not live without it.</li>
    <li> not worth the money...it is ok!</li>
    <li> Ive been using it on my face for over a month and I haven&#x27;t seen any results. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t really been working... Only used it for a week &amp; caused my neck to break out a bit... I&#x27;ll keep trying it since some people have said they don&#x27;t see results till a month of using it...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the great results that everyone else raved about but it did make my skin feel a little softer.  It felt like a moisturizer to me rather than a firming and lifting cream. I probably won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> really does not seem to be doing much of anything for my skin&lt;br /&gt;nice consistently and pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;no improvements</li>
    <li> I purchase these products for my Wife and she states there are no other products as effective or as pleasing in use (Anew Clinical Thermafirm). I really liked the product price as offered by the Supplier, Clear Focus, and I was amazed that I received the product today (ordered May 20) which is 23 May 2014. Clear Focus earned another order from me (double the quantity from the first order) which I placed this day.</li>
    <li> I used this cream religiously until I had wiped the bottom of the jar clean and could not tell one difference in my skin. I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and consider myself a skin-care fanatic, so for me to give something such a low rating, trust me........it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I love the Avon eye cream and consider it the best I have ever found, so am truly disappointed in this Avon product. You could probably use Vaseline and get about or better results. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.  I use this in the morning and the Anew Wrinkle corrector at night.  I feel the combo have been great in keeping my skin nice looking.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvement to my skin, but it left my skin soft.  I did not see any firmness to my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lifting cream. It makes your face feel super soft, and I have noticed a change already in my face. And, the seller of this product is great. There is great communication, and the shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> Great product, great experience. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and it is one of the best. I just love it and don&#x27;t want to do without it....</li>
    <li> I like the Thermafirm  as a moisturizer because it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy even in the humidity of Missouri.</li>
    <li> rec&#x27;d this product very quickly.  Works amazing...Hoping to buy another one ASAP.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for at least three years and confirm that it does help to lift and firm the face.</li>
    <li> Guess this product is for a much younger  woman.  I read some reviews and they were positive but they did not mention there age.  That is why 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before and it is awesome.  Ive also used on my stretch marks from puberty and  I&#x27;m 29  yrs old and this is the only stuff that&#x27;s made my marks fade and tan, its weird cuz my stretch marks were really deep , like scratches in soap even between my pit and my boobs  pretty gross</li>
    <li> I have used this product off and on for a few years and don&#x27;t really see a big improvement.  Just ok in my estimation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product... It really works!!!!</li>
    <li> This reminds me of the Neutrogena Copper which is discontinued.  It does work on firming the face.  I really love this cream.  I use the Advanced Wrinkle cream by Avon over it.  This price is better than in catalogue.  Shipped quickly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> I have loved Therafirm for years.  It&#x27;s so light and melts into your skin - i love the way it smells.  If i could afford LaMer i would use it, but my bank account insists i am more practical, so Therafirm is my choice.  I really think Avon puts out quality products and my face looks good.  I am almost 56 and a woman at the barn i keep my horse at told me the other day she thought i was in my 40&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past. I highly recommend it. I have normal skin slightly on the dry side. Anew products work well for my skin type. Be sure to pay attention to the size when ordering . I  have neglected to check the size in the past and received a sample ( Not from this seller). Estee Lauder is my passion but the prices were going up up up needless to say killing my pocket book. I found this to be the best comparable product reasonable prices.</li>
