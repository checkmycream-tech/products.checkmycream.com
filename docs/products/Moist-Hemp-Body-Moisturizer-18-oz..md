      <li>It really moisturizes and it smells great!</li>
      <li>The best moisturizer I have across so far.  </li>
      <li>the fact that its coconut oil based is a good sign and thats usually pretty good for the skin already.</li>
      <li>Now, my hands are very smooth looking.  </li>
      <li>but I have a favorite that I get from Amazon and will stick with that one from now on.</li>
      <li>I really love the smell of this lotion.</li>

      <li>This is the best moisturizer ever it have my skin soft and smooth and well nourished....</li>
      <li>I like it better than the Hempz brand because of the smell of this one is more preferable by me.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this brand of moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>good lotion, applies pretty evenly and doesnt leave a layer of chemically feeling after.</li>
      <li>if you have dry skin this is the perfect moisturizer</li>
      <li>I expected something wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Really strong.</li>
      <li>I got this because of all the fabulous reviews.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I prefer HEMP by the Moist Company as it works beautifully on the driest of skin and heals dry patches, scars and eczema.</li>
      <li>There is an original \\&quot;HEMP\\&quot; brand, its my fault for not realizing</li>
      <li>but i guess more natural ingredients would cost more.</li>
      <li>Great for my very dry skin.</li>
      <li>Great for very dry skin.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>No only moisturizes, but is also good aromatherapy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like something I&#x27;ve ever smelled before - sweet, like candy and almonds.  </li>
      <li>I have mild eczema and this stuff soothes and clears up the area.</li>
      <li>I got this for my boyfriend, he is a long time user and loves this, I also think it smells good.</li>
      <li>For the price, It was totally worth getting</li>
      <li>For the natural ingredients and size, this lotion is ridiculously cheap, too.</li>
      <li>really keeps my sundrenched forehead in good shape (i am  slightly bald guy)  </li>
      <li>I have only tried the original scents, but I have found that they are not overpowering and fade quickly.  </li>
      <li>Look for better alternatives that actually contain real ingredients.</li>
      <li>It is a nice lotion,  but  is pretty ordinary.  </li>
      <li>I am, however, very sensitive to the way lotions feel after I put them on.  </li>
      <li>Many people get this mixed up with the more expensive HEMPZ with a Z.</li>
      <li>Something natural and something you can pronounce!</li>
      <li>My hands had aged tremendously.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m not super-sensitive to lotion-y smells, but my husband is and would avoid getting near me if this scent bothered him (it doesn&#x27;t).</li>
      <li>I have problems with my finger tips splitting in the winter and this really helps with the dry skin.  </li>
      <li>The second you put it on your skin feels so hydrated and soft.  </li>
      <li>I will say that i bought my bottle at sallys for a little over 7 dollars with my sallys card and it is like 8.50 without one, so it is a little cheaper to purchase there. :)</li>
      <li>All the Creative Labs products are chock full of parabens and other preservatives that are dangerous.  </li>

    <li> Really good maintenance lotion for eczema!</li>
    <li> Great lotion. The second ingredient is coconut oil. Something natural and something you can pronounce! I worked in a kitchen for a long time and my hands were COVERED in chemical burns. It was horrific, but this lotion saved me. I used it all the time when I was working. The second you put it on your skin feels so hydrated and soft.  The smell is amazing. It&#x27;s not like something I&#x27;ve ever smelled before - sweet, like candy and almonds.  For the natural ingredients and size, this lotion is ridiculously cheap, too.</li>
    <li> great moisturizing lotion</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend, he is a long time user and loves this, I also think it smells good.</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic. I love the smell and it is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> There is an original \\&quot;HEMP\\&quot; brand, its my fault for not realizing but this was on sale @ Sally&#x27;s for \\&quot;5.99\\&quot; &amp; the ORIGINAL hemp lotion is much expensive so I thought this was a steel.  Anyway, it smells really bad .... Like vomit mixed with fragrance.  Really strong.</li>
    <li> Many people get this mixed up with the more expensive HEMPZ with a Z. I prefer HEMP by the Moist Company as it works beautifully on the driest of skin and heals dry patches, scars and eczema. My guess is that it is due to the coconut oil, which is the second ingredient in this product. You can also find this product at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply stores if you don&#x27;t want to purchase online. Just try it once. Your skin will be moisturized and beautiful. I cannot say enough about this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Hemp body moisturizer on my hands for approximately three to four months.  My hands were very dry, had marks on them from where my puppy had chewed my hand up, and had dark spots on the backs of my knuckles.  My hands had aged tremendously.  I leave the moisturizer in my desk at work and don&#x27;t use it any other time.  Now, my hands are very smooth looking.  In fact, my hands don&#x27;t look they don&#x27;t belong at the end of my arms.  I would definitely give this product a two thumbs up.  I will be purchasing another bottle to use at home.  After all, I want my arms to look just as youthful as my hands!</li>
    <li> too expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> awesome lotion.. best i have ever used!! really keeps my sundrenched forehead in good shape (i am  slightly bald guy)  lol</li>

    <li> This is the best moisturizer ever it have my skin soft and smooth and well nourished.... if you have dry skin this is the perfect moisturizer</li>
    <li> I got this because of all the fabulous reviews.  I expected something wonderful.  It is a nice lotion,  but  is pretty ordinary.  I was expecting a lotion with a wonderful smell, but it smells a lot like coconut oil which I do not care for.  If one likes that smell than I would recommend this but if not look elsewhere. Just wanted to try it but I have a favorite that I get from Amazon and will stick with that one from now on.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t go on as thick as the &amp;#34;hempz&amp;#34; lotion brand, but some people may like that. I will say that i bought my bottle at sallys for a little over 7 dollars with my sallys card and it is like 8.50 without one, so it is a little cheaper to purchase there. :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brand of moisturizers.  I have only tried the original scents, but I have found that they are not overpowering and fade quickly.  I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m not super-sensitive to lotion-y smells, but my husband is and would avoid getting near me if this scent bothered him (it doesn&#x27;t). I am, however, very sensitive to the way lotions feel after I put them on.  If they don&#x27;t soak in or if they leave a film I won&#x27;t touch the stuff.  I have not experienced that with this brand of moisturizers.  I use their facial moisturizer and it cleared my face of dry patches (I have dry, sensitive skin) within a week or two and the patches stay gone!  I can&#x27;t rave enough about this line of lotions...I just hope they keep making them!  I have seen this brand at Sally Beauty and on Amazon, but I&#x27;m having trouble finding it anywhere else. Good price. Good product. Very happy customer! :D</li>
    <li> My hands are never dry, cracking or rough anymore. My wife uses this every day and  that is why she loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great</li>
    <li> Used to use Aveeno... that&#x27;s a good product. But since being introduced to moist hemp I&#x27;m hooked. Its almost like medicine for the skin. I have mild eczema and this stuff soothes and clears up the area. Have even used it as emergency lip balm. Miracle cream</li>
    <li> This lotion works extremely well! I use it for my face and my body. I used to buy organic face creams, but they just don&#x27;t work as well as Hemp Body Moisturizer! Great product!</li>
    <li> Smells great and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this from my stylist and went online to order more. No only moisturizes, but is also good aromatherapy. The smell reminds me of vacation and the beach. I get a taste of the beach every morning when I lotion up!</li>
    <li> Buyer beware.  All the Creative Labs products are chock full of parabens and other preservatives that are dangerous.  I was going to buy this until I read the ingredients.....I urge you to not buy it.  Look for better alternatives that actually contain real ingredients.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I have across so far.  I like the way my skin feels when I use this product.</li>
    <li> It really moisturizes and it smells great! For the price, It was totally worth getting and I would love to buy more once I run out :)</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Great for my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Although this lotion is thin it does the job and I love the scent!</li>
    <li> I have problems with my finger tips splitting in the winter and this really helps with the dry skin.  I wish I could buy it local.</li>
