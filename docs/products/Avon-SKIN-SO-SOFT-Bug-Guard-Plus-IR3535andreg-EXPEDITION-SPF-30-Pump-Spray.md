      <li>but it takes the top coat off your nails.</li>
      <li>The product works as advertised one of the better repellents and works on all ages.</li>
      <li>It has been heard a lot that Avon-skin-soft series can keep bugs away from you being unlike most of bug sprays.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it and it detracts mosquitoes and protects me from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  </li>
      <li>work!It&#x27;s smells better then \\&quot;off\\&quot; and feels better on the skin.</li>
      <li>Need to get more Sun and Bug and try it out on Mount baldy for comparison.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have used the skin-so-soft product line for many years</li>
      <li>Therefore I had to leave it where we were on vacation after only a couple of applications as I could not risk packing it it into our hold baggage for the plane and leaking over our best clothes, so the per application cost was astronomical.</li>
      <li>Used this many times before.  </li>
      <li>Always love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It keeps the bugs away pretty well, keeps me from getting burned AND it smells nice!</li>
      <li>Plus they LOVE his skin so go figure.</li>
      <li>For the price, Cutter is a much better deal even though it doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s ok to use it after you&#x27;re dressed.</li>
      <li>I love this product.   </li>
      <li>In fact, we were bitten more than if we have used nothing at all.</li>
      <li>I was able to put one on each porch, and one in each car, which worked out way better for us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff -- we have so many gnats and things around here.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have a lot of Avon sellers in our area, so being able to buy it here on Amazon</li>
      <li>The bugs love it.  </li>
      <li>We love this stuff - it smells good, is easy to apply on squirmy children, soaks in quickly, and has kept us from getting any sunburn even in the Florida sun.</li>
      <li>Good product, fast shipping!</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, but fades quickly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with your perfume.  </li>
      <li>So Soft Bug Guard worked great while on vacation in the Dominican Republic.</li>
      <li>Has a nice smell and not afraid to use it and go to a party or picnic.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  </li>
      <li>I also like the pump, it is easy to control the amount that you put on and buy spraying some in the palm of your hand</li>
      <li>I have switched to DEET, much more effective for a much longer time and, to me, almost undetectable smell.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend it for Tick repellant; you still need some strong deet on pant legs and socks for that.</li>
      <li>This firt time purchase and trial experience proves it right and definitely a good choice.</li>
      <li>Over the years I have still not found a more effective repellant, and over the years Avon had recognized and developed a product specifically for outdoors use.  </li>
      <li>I spray this product lightly all over my body (do not rub it in) before going out trail riding on my hybrid mountain bike and NEVER get bitten.  </li>
      <li>It is light and not overpoweringly stinky.  </li>
      <li>The spray also goes on light and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>Also, the mosquitoes would have made me light headed from the huge loss of blood.</li>
      <li>This is DEET free too.</li>
      <li>lower leg area after a couple of hours and lightly misted my arms after about lunch time.  </li>
      <li>I love this product as much as I did years ago!  </li>
      <li>I was right!</li>
      <li>Might have gotten bitten more without, but won&#x27;t really know.  </li>
      <li>The mosquitoes are out full force this year and the sun has been out nice as strong all summer long.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly accompanied by a well worded invoice.</li>
      <li>I spend a lot of time in Central American countries and this bug spray/sunscreen is excellent!</li>
      <li>but it dries into or onto the skin so quickly.  </li>
      <li>its not sticky and dries quickly after applied.</li>
      <li>So you get a two-fer with this product and I highly reccomend it and it doesn&#x27;t stink like most bug sprays.</li>
      <li>It leaks easily and it very oily.</li>
      <li>I wish that I had sprayed this on before leaving the hotel on our first day in Yellowstone!  </li>
      <li>It is by far the safest, longest lasting, and most effective bug repellant that I have used.</li>
      <li>Which is good in terms of not requiring much product, but again, it&#x27;s not enough to block the sun effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a bug repellant, it works ok and smells much better than any other repellant I have ever</li>
      <li>Also, I went through the bottle pretty quickly</li>
      <li>For many years I have tried many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; bug repellents with no success.</li>
      <li>Worked really well at keeping the bugs away with no bad smell or chemicals.  </li>
      <li>and I find the smell blindingly strong, like sticking my nose directly into a bottle of citronella.</li>
      <li>It works without the chemical smell of most similar products.</li>
      <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that WORKS to keep my skin safe while I&#x27;m out doing yard</li>
      <li>Pretty itchy.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Always the first to be bitten.</li>
      <li>Stays on all night, and makes my skin soft and comfortable.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Never have used it.  It was for our trip back to Virginia and we never made the trip.  My son may have used it.</li>
    <li> This is the only bug spray I use on my family. All the other DEET free alternatives I have tried have either not worked as well or smelled terrible. I stock up every summer because we live in the swamp.</li>
    <li> I tried this after using a bunch of other things against mosquitos that had little to no effect. I do notice a decrease in bites but the downsides are the fact that it is not nice to handle; I touched my mouse with my hand after spraying it on and it actually etched away part of the plastic. Also, I went through the bottle pretty quickly and I&#x27;m not a fan of the spray mechanism but that is personal preference of course.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time on a trail run. The black flies were horrendous. However, they were dive bombing me and bouncing away. Normally I would have been eaten alive. Also, the mosquitoes would have made me light headed from the huge loss of blood. This is DEET free too. It&#x27;s all good!</li>
    <li> works great, no greasy feeling, dries quickly and without odor</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t know this already? Avon Skin so soft keeps mosquitoes from biting, but this bug guard goes one step further. you have to have this for yourself and your kids, any kids on sport teams, this is a must! its light weight, doesn&#x27;t stain and i love it! Also keep chiggers off and gnats. Always reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Used this on climb on Mount Baldy.  Got bitten on arms.  Pretty itchy.  Might have gotten bitten more without, but won&#x27;t really know.  Sun and Bug with the DEET actually worked better.  Got no bites when I used this in Belize.  Need to get more Sun and Bug and try it out on Mount baldy for comparison.</li>
    <li> This applied easily and did not have an awful smell, but the bottle leaked very badly, despite making sure that it was properly and tightly screwed together (as it comes with the nozzle applicator packaged separately).  Therefore I had to leave it where we were on vacation after only a couple of applications as I could not risk packing it it into our hold baggage for the plane and leaking over our best clothes, so the per application cost was astronomical.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that WORKS to keep my skin safe while I&#x27;m out doing yard work!It&#x27;s smells better then \\&quot;off\\&quot; and feels better on the skin. The sun block part works great too, I have very pale skin and burn easy, I haven&#x27;t gotten a sunburn or bug bite all summer which is saying something! The mosquitoes are out full force this year and the sun has been out nice as strong all summer long. I&#x27;d recommend this!</li>
    <li> Tired of noseeums and mosquito bites. This product works very well. I use it everyday because I am always outside! You do have to reapply after being out for about 5-6 hours. Has a nice smell and not afraid to use it and go to a party or picnic. Ordered through Amazon Avon charges $14.00 if they don&#x27;t have a sale.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time in Central American countries and this bug spray/sunscreen is excellent! It keeps the bugs away pretty well, keeps me from getting burned AND it smells nice!</li>
    <li> i used this product in Antigua which is infested with misquitoes.  the combination of misquito repellant and SPF 30, worked very well for laying out on the beach. i recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.   I went to the golf course and I came back bite free.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff -- we have so many gnats and things around here.  The smell is nice, but fades quickly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with your perfume.  Stays on all night, and makes my skin soft and comfortable.  When you spray it on, be sure to step away from the spray cloud as quickly as you can -- the mist can cause painful coughing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s the extra thing this keeps away?  Bedbugs.  We have a chronic problem with them in this building and, since I&#x27;ve been using this, I haven&#x27;t been bitten by or seen one.  I spray it over myself, especially where the bedbugs like to bite (my lower torso).  It doesn&#x27;t sting sensitive parts.</li>
    <li> Used skin so soft decades ago.  Worked ok, but not in the same ballpark with this.  Great that get the protection and a gentle skin product to boot...</li>
    <li> I have used this for years to avoid DEET but it works only if I use a lot and I find the smell blindingly strong, like sticking my nose directly into a bottle of citronella. Some people don&#x27;t have the same negative reaction that I do so I advise getting a small amount to try before buying a bunch, maybe it will not bother you. I have switched to DEET, much more effective for a much longer time and, to me, almost undetectable smell.</li>
    <li> I guess this is about the best product to use for keeping the gnats off of you..but it isn&#x27;t a cure. The only cure is to MOVE!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cutter and BullFrog, both of which I liked a lot, and thought I would try this one as well. I was a little shocked by how small the bottle was, but other than that, it works as well as the other ones, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t have DEET, isn&#x27;t oily. For the price, Cutter is a much better deal even though it doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen. I always use sunscreen anyway, since I don&#x27;t use enough of any of these products to feel I can rely on them for sun protection. I would rather put on my No-Ad SPF 30 and then just a few spritzes of insect repellent. So I probably won&#x27;t get this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bullfrog also has sunscreen (SPF 30), but as mentioned, I&#x27;m thinking I will just go back to the combination of sunblock + repellent. It would take quite a few sprays of any of these products to get complete sunblock protection, and you just don&#x27;t need that much to keep the bugs away; at least, I don&#x27;t, and believe me, the mosquitos just love me. ch ch ch ch ch for each arm, maybe ch x 6 for each leg, ch ch ch into my hands, rub &amp; dab on my forehead, neck, ears. That much keeps the mosquitos away but doesn&#x27;t get the entire limb at all. Which is good in terms of not requiring much product, but again, it&#x27;s not enough to block the sun effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So once again, it&#x27;s back to Cutter.</li>
    <li> Perfect for kids or adults!  Gret smell and non toxic!  Bug spray and sunscreen both effective.  Ordering more of these now!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first experience with monsoon season and everyone I talked to recommended this for repelling mosquitoes.  I am a magnet for the blood suckers and this works pretty well, I guess.  It irritates my skin with a slight stinging sensation right after I put it on and I feel sticky for awhile, until it rubs into my clothing. The pump is awkward to use with one&#x27;s non-dominant hand, so I end up poring some into my hands and rubbing it on. I&#x27;ll try the lotion version when I&#x27;m doe with this spray. I think I just feel miserable early mornings and dusk, what with the humidity and the mosquitoes. This repellant keeps the bites down, but adds to my discomfort in a different way- yuk!</li>
    <li> Keeps the mosquitos and gnats away all day and it smells good too. plus it makes your skin soft. I just like it for the bug repellant effect.</li>
    <li> I wish that I had sprayed this on before leaving the hotel on our first day in Yellowstone!  Hindsight is indeed 20/20... the bugs, especially horse flies are vicious.  Spray this on your hat if you don&#x27;t want to put it on your face.  I have very sensitive skin and have suffered immensely from the bug bites I sustained on day 1.  When I did spray on subsequent days, the bugs stayed away from me, even in the evenings.</li>
    <li> For many years I have tried many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; bug repellents with no success. For last 10 yrs I have used products with a minimum of 19% Deet which ended up making me very sick due to over use. I&#x27;m always outside and always need protection. This product is 100% affective and been using it daily in the high humidity and forest areas. The only drawback is the smell, the oily feeling and you can&#x27;t spray it on your clothes due to too oily. I would purchase again just for the fact that it&#x27;s not DEET and repells ALL bugs!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Very oily.  Strong but not too unpleasant scent. last the entire school day.  Has SPF and is waterproof.  We think the postives were enough to buy more.</li>
    <li> its not sticky and dries quickly after applied. doesn&#x27;t have an odor either. works great! I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and try as much as possible to avoid chemical skin care. I usually use a chemical free sunscreen and a separate chemical repellent spray (when required). I am a magnet for biters and I also react badly when bitten. I have recently moved to a place where the mosquitoes are out and about all day and all night! When outside I need to be protected.  I decided to try this product as I thought it would be perfect for those spur of the moment outdoor adventures. (I have a two and a half year old boy) The one&#x27;s where you go to run errands, sans sunscreen &amp; bug spray and then find you have time to stop off at the park for half an hour on the way home. This spray gets a big \\&quot;four stars\\&quot;. It loses one point because it did start my eczema off after a three day use but as I said I do have very sensitive skin. For me it&#x27;s a great combination product to have in the car for emergencys but not something I could personally use everyday. It has a very pleasant smell and is very light on the skin.  It initially feels greasy when first applied but it dries into or onto the skin so quickly.  No residue on clothes so it&#x27;s ok to use it after you&#x27;re dressed. Yep, I recon&#x27; this is a good one.</li>
    <li> Used this many times before.  It works.  The summer is coming so we are buying it again.</li>
    <li> It is by far the safest, longest lasting, and most effective bug repellant that I have used. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> We use it in all winter for mosquitos and it works great. A must for the tropics for bug control.</li>
    <li> arrived on time. Product is a bit heavy on heated skin, but gets the job done.  I like the pump was separate.</li>
    <li> I have used the skin-so-soft product line for many years and yes it does repell insects. I also like the pump, it is easy to control the amount that you put on and buy spraying some in the palm of your hand you can place it on your neck and ears with ease.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for over a week in an area with heavy mosquito presence yet I have not been bitten while using this product.</li>
    <li> Based on avon&#x27;s \\&quot;skin so soft\\&quot; bath oil, that I started using twenty years ago while working as a land surveyer in the swamps of central Florida. Over the years I have still not found a more effective repellant, and over the years Avon had recognized and developed a product specifically for outdoors use.  The addition of spf30 protection greatly inhanses the product and I use it on all my hikes.  It is an oil based product and does not dry.  Don&#x27;t forget to spray your ankles and socks well, as this will stop fire ants from crawling up your legs.  Don&#x27;t use on your face or rub your eyes with clothing you&#x27;ve sprayed it on is the only precaution I would give.</li>
    <li> Awful smell. Doesn&#x27;t do much in keeping bugs away. It arrived quickly accompanied by a well worded invoice. Nice vendor. Avon skin so soft bug guard is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> We put this on our 2 dogs that were being bothered by some sort of bugs.  It helped a bit, but did not solve the problem.</li>
    <li> Where I live we have &amp;#34;buffalo nats&amp;#34; in the spring. They are really the same black fly of Canada &amp; Alaska. The past few years they have been an early spring plague here in Baja Indiana. I have to wear a head net just like when I lived in Alaska. Deet does not deter the Buffalo Nat, eh? Some people use vanilla extract and the pure non-imitation sort of works but only on the Nats. I have used the Avon sun screen plus insect repellant for years on canoe trips in the North. AND, come to find out it is the best stuff you can buy to keep the Black Flies and other insects away. I would not recommend it for Tick repellant; you still need some strong deet on pant legs and socks for that.</li>
    <li> This provides both sun protection and bug spray protection-- so it is great to pack in my tennis bag.  I love the smell of it and it detracts mosquitoes and protects me from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  I like the spray pump.</li>
    <li> I am a magnet for insects and this product helped me this summer. Inexpensive and it does not smell like a pesticide.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  The bugs love it.  Does not deter them from landing on you what so ever.</li>
    <li> Works as it should. No complaints from me. I send it to preschool in my daughters backpack. Doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
    <li> Its bug spray none of its perfect. It kinda works...but it takes the top coat off your nails. SO be warned!!! I didn&#x27;t realize how sticky it would be either. Definitely leaves a residue.</li>
    <li> Worked really well at keeping the bugs away with no bad smell or chemicals.  We love it and used it all summer long.  I&#x27;ll stock up on plenty more this summer.  Great product.</li>
    <li> We purchased before heading on vacation to St. Lucia and the product did not work at all. In fact, we were bitten more than if we have used nothing at all. The mosquitos seemed to be attracted to the product as we were infested with bites throughout our trip. I will stick with my Off product from now on.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly to keep the mosquitoes away.  It works, doesn&#x27;t reek of chemicals and lasts a long time.  Bonus, it has some sun protection also.  This is a must for working in my flower beds and garden.</li>
    <li> My son is allergic to mosquito bites, I&#x27;m talking his leg swells and oozes when they bite. Plus they LOVE his skin so go figure. Not one bite since my son has started using this. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent, it&#x27;s too chemically. If this comes in unscented, it would be perfect. $14 is steep but you can usually get them BOGO.</li>
    <li> Rumor or not bugs stay away and the smell does not overwhelm or the ingredients harm you. Spray effective way to deliver  the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I used these product years ago when I was on an archaeological dig for the summer.  I used it for both my sunblock, as well as my bug repellent.  Recently, I took a trip to the Florida Keys and I thought it might come in handy.  I was right! I love this product as much as I did years ago!  It is light and not overpoweringly stinky.  The bugs leave you alone and you won&#x27;t get sunburned!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Avon Skin So Soft Bug Guard worked great while on vacation in the Dominican Republic. I wore this on my fiance had bites all over his feet and legs b/c he chose NOT to use the bug spray. It has a great coconut fragrance and smells just like sun tan lotion, which is also great to use while on the beach. The spray also goes on light and non-greasy. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> The product itself seems to work under moderate conditions for 2-3 hours. In the deep woods, I would use something else.  My only issue would be the spray pump; It leaks.</li>
    <li> Mosquitos are extremely attracted to me. Always the first to be bitten. This bug spray is gentle on the skin and nose. And, it has worked effectively for me!</li>
    <li> We used this product at Girl Scout day camp and it worked great.  Both me and my daughter used it and neither of us got sun-burned and no bug bites!  I put it on in the morning before we left for camp and it seemed to last all day.  I did re-apply it on my ankle/lower leg area after a couple of hours and lightly misted my arms after about lunch time.  I am definitely getting this product again!</li>
    <li> It has been heard a lot that Avon-skin-soft series can keep bugs away from you being unlike most of bug sprays. This firt time purchase and trial experience proves it right and definitely a good choice. The product doesn&#x27;t smell chemical like other bug repellents; conversely, it smells pretty aromatic to me. With this on, I can concentrate on heavy field works without either worrying about bug harassment or wearing the oily, thick and toxic bug repellents I used to apply on all over my body.</li>
    <li> it works and smells great</li>
    <li> Smells good,gets bugs off of me, and protects me from the sun while I walk in my jungle like neighborhood in Florida! Love it.</li>
    <li> As a bug repellant, it works ok and smells much better than any other repellant I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as a sunscreen, I have a hard time believing it is SPF30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I putted it on my arm / sholder before gardening (out in the sun about 2 hours in the morning), and I still got burned!  I would say it felt like SPF 7 or so to me.</li>
    <li> A Good Offense is the Best Defense...so I attack those little outdoor pests with my Skin so Soft Bug Guard and I am defended against all insect bites all day!  I spray this product lightly all over my body (do not rub it in) before going out trail riding on my hybrid mountain bike and NEVER get bitten.  I ran out a while back and opted not to use any type of bug spray for a couple of days, and sure enough, I came back with 2 bites the first day and 3 the second day out....then I used another product and still had some pests buzzing and flying around me.  BUT, when I received my new order of SSS Bug Guard and used it before biking that day, once again I was not only free of bites but it seems to place a barrier around me, cause I had very few to no bugs ever buzzing/flying around me, which allows me to bike safely (no swatting insects away) and also enjoy the natural scenery around me on a peaceful ride.  Since my trails are partially sunny/partially shaded, I trust the 30 spf sunscreen in this product also, because I have not been sunburned all summer using just this product. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised one of the better repellents and works on all ages. Recommend this for travellers  with kids.</li>
    <li> Use it on are horse worked well!!</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing to keep me from getting bitten by mosquitoes.  It goes on the skin pretty thick and definitely leaves a film.  Gave it two stars because it does seem to work as a sunblock, but definitely not a bug repellent.</li>
    <li> Skin so soft Expedition is longer lasting than the original: eight hours verses three.;also,you get a larger bottle.with its itemized top separation,so you don&#x27;t lose any.I carry this in my payback;bugs just love me.</li>
    <li> we buy this any time we travel to a mosquito environment local (used in Costa Rica and Alaska).  It smells good, it&#x27;s non toxic, and it works.  Not 5 star because the packaging is not 100% leak-proof.  A simple solution however is to put in a plastic bag while traveling around.</li>
    <li> Works like  dream keeping the bugs away.</li>
    <li> A must have if you are an international traveler to locations with mosquitos and diseases.</li>
    <li> For the anti-aerosol people, this gives you everything in a pump version.  It works without the chemical smell of most similar products.</li>
    <li> Put contents on a wash cloth, then you can control how much or little you want to use.  Has a very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Yes, I really like it and it does work for me.  I live near the Florida coast and there are many no-seeums.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it has oil in it and I have to wash it out of my hair every time I use it. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> product itself it quite good, but the packaging is awful! It leaks easily and it very oily. Not for me.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best bug spray that I have ever used and will continue to use it. I was stationed in Honduras where the bugs are vicious and would chew me up because I&#x27;m such a sweet person well maybe not that seet but they tried to eat me alive but after using this product I was golden the bugs didn&#x27;t want any part of me which was a good thing because I was tired of itching and it has built in sun screen. So you get a two-fer with this product and I highly reccomend it and it doesn&#x27;t stink like most bug sprays.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all! As a matter of fact, for the 10 minutes that I was outside, it attracted more Mosquitos than if I didn&#x27;t apply this. I wanted it to work so bad!</li>
    <li> This product worked great at warding off mosquitoes. Especially since the first night of my arrival to a mosquito infested area I forgot to put it on and got several bites- but after using this, no more bites! The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that the product seems a little greasy/oily.</li>
    <li> Always love this stuff.</li>
    <li> We swear by this product whenever we travel or at our Florida home.  It really works on all the little blighters that . try and get our blood.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Fast shipping.  The wife and I carry and use this while hiking.  We also spray it on our dogs when they are going outside.  Works wonders for the flys and mosquitos</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  This product works well for me and doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as most others.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin, and it isn&#x27;t greasy, which is a plus.  I was surprised when my order arrived and instead of the two large bottles I ordered, I got the same quantity, but in four small bottles.  BONUS!  I was able to put one on each porch, and one in each car, which worked out way better for us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t have a lot of Avon sellers in our area, so being able to buy it here on Amazon was another &#x27;plus&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This pump spray works very well on the no-see-um bugs in Florida!  Because it is a pump you can always get the product out unlike the canister spray!</li>
    <li> We love this stuff - it smells good, is easy to apply on squirmy children, soaks in quickly, and has kept us from getting any sunburn even in the Florida sun. I&#x27;m assuming the bug block works as well, since no one ever has mosquito bites. I highly recommend it and plan on always using it for my family.</li>
    <li> this stuff REALLY works</li>
