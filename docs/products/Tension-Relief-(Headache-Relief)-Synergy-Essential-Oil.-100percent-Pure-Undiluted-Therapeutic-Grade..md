      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this company and all of their blends!</li>
      <li>I have been buying peppermint for my headaches for years and bought this hoping this may help and this is much better!</li>
      <li>I like this amazing blend better than just using peppermint,</li>
      <li>I also have the roller version, which makes application really easy, and I can refill it with this and coconut oil as needed!</li>
      <li>and I felt better by that afternoon.</li>
      <li>I really love this blend.</li>
      <li>My massage clients absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Smell is just wonderful with like 12  different oils in this synergy and helps out a lot with headaches as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic for tension headaches.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know honestly where this oil comes from but who really cares if it works for your problems like it did mine.</li>
      <li>I also appreciate the fact that this company can stand on their own, meaning they do not have  page after page of high rated reviews (bogus IMO) from  people who they offer free products to in exchange for their review.</li>
      <li>Very good oils for about half what the two leaders in oils charge.</li>
      <li>I love it so much for both</li>

      <li>I am so glad that they renamed it tension relief because that is really what this is.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
      <li>the synergy of the different oils really seems to work great.</li>
      <li>Got product quickly.</li>
      <li>I found this and figured it was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>You could say some brands hold more monoatomic  elements but unless your taking them internally what&#x27;s the point of paying 80$ when you can get such an amazing synergistic stack like plant therapy uses.great product</li>
      <li>Just as good as other named brands!</li>
      <li>It worked fast with a migraine headache that came on quickly.  </li>
      <li>Smells good, as expected, but does diddly squat to relieve a real headache or migraine.</li>
      <li>I have tried various blends and companies for essential oil headache relief and this one has worked the best for me personally!  </li>
      <li>, she was feeling much better and the headache had significantly gone down.</li>
      <li>but then again nothing really does, so I certainly don&#x27;t fault this blend for that!</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s handpicked by the pope and grows in a isolated field in the middle of nowhere no oil should cost more than 20-30$ with all the modern day extraction equipment that&#x27;s being used.</li>
      <li>This is worth a try for mild to moderate headache pain.</li>
      <li>The next morning she was headache free.</li>
      <li>Works really well for all my families headaches.</li>
      <li>First of all and of utmost importance, this essential oil blend passed the blot test with flying colors!  </li>
      <li>It may not help much for a migraine, but people are different.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as intense/strong as Young Living&#x27;s Deep Relief, but still helps with my daughter&#x27;s migranes at an affordable price!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works!! I apply it to the back of my neck and within minutes my headache is gone.</li>
    <li> Smell is just wonderful with like 12  different oils in this synergy and helps out a lot with headaches as advertised.  I have researched all these essential oil companies with ridulous prices like youngs etc which is just robbery. I don&#x27;t know honestly where this oil comes from but who really cares if it works for your problems like it did mine. In my opinion this oil worked just as well if not better then some other expensive brands that costed me over 50-60$&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s handpicked by the pope and grows in a isolated field in the middle of nowhere no oil should cost more than 20-30$ with all the modern day extraction equipment that&#x27;s being used. You could say some brands hold more monoatomic  elements but unless your taking them internally what&#x27;s the point of paying 80$ when you can get such an amazing synergistic stack like plant therapy uses.great product and I will order again!</li>
    <li> works great on headaches.</li>
    <li> Works like its suppose to and smells awesome too</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as intense/strong as Young Living&#x27;s Deep Relief, but still helps with my daughter&#x27;s migranes at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I love this blend! I am so glad that they renamed it tension relief because that is really what this is. When I am sitting at my desk working at the computer for hours, I have a tenancy to hunch my shoulders and when I get up I have a low dull headache and a cramp in my neck. If I diffuse this blend while working, I walk away relaxed and fully functional. I love it so much for both it&#x27;s headache and tension relieving properties, that I carry a roller bottle of it with me all the time. I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Just as good as other named brands!</li>
    <li> nothing close to doterra oils</li>
    <li> My massage clients absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> First of all and of utmost importance, this essential oil blend passed the blot test with flying colors!  I really like how it soothes the tense muscles of my shoulders and neck. I massage it into my temples, forehead and wrists when I feel a headache coming on. I dilute it with grapeseed or almond oil. I also appreciate the fact that this company can stand on their own, meaning they do not have  page after page of high rated reviews (bogus IMO) from  people who they offer free products to in exchange for their review. This blend is the bomb!</li>
    <li> Smells good, as expected, but does diddly squat to relieve a real headache or migraine. For those of use who really suffer, we&#x27;re gonna need something better than this. I use it in my diffuser and it&#x27;s nice for a pleasant background relaxing smell.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for tension headaches. Love this company and all of their blends!</li>
    <li> odd smell, not similar to other &#x27;headache relief&#x27; oils, threw it out</li>
    <li> I really love this blend. I made a rollerball for my office, keep some in the car and some at home. It really seems to help and if nothing else I feel like I&#x27;m cutting down on my Aleve intake. I like this amazing blend better than just using peppermint, the synergy of the different oils really seems to work great. It&#x27;s a keeper!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful blend than truly does sooth some of my headaches. It doesn&#x27;t really help my serious migraines but then again nothing really does, so I certainly don&#x27;t fault this blend for that! I have even put it in my diffuser after cleaning my house just to make things smell great. I&#x27;m so happy I found this blend!</li>
    <li> Relieved my Headache within 30 min.</li>
    <li> It worked fast with a migraine headache that came on quickly.  I put it on the back of my neck and a dab under my nose which I should have mixed with my carrier oil but didn&#x27;t think about it.  I felt a little sick to my stomach for awhile but that passed along with my headache.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been buying peppermint for my headaches for years and bought this hoping this may help and this is much better! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried various blends and companies for essential oil headache relief and this one has worked the best for me personally!  It smells good and does a great job with my headaches.  I also have the roller version, which makes application really easy, and I can refill it with this and coconut oil as needed!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product for minor headaches. Mine are usually allergy and sinus related. Hopefully it will help.</li>
    <li> Great company. Very good oils for about half what the two leaders in oils charge. This oil was helpful for a tension headache. It may not help much for a migraine, but people are different. This is worth a try for mild to moderate headache pain. Got product quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I and my fiance both have headaches from time to time and sometimes they are severe. We are tired of using OTC medications and wanted to try something else. I found this and figured it was worth a shot. When I got it, my fiance was actually in the midst of a 2 day headache. I had her put some on and by that evening, she was feeling much better and the headache had significantly gone down. The next morning she was headache free. I was at first skeptical, but then about a week later I had a headache and so I put some of this oil on and I felt better by that afternoon.</li>
    <li> Works really well for all my families headaches. Even made some up for friends that suffer from migrane headaches and it works well for them.</li>
