### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great mug for homemade shaving soap!</li>
      <li>Perfect mug for me as I travel often for work.</li>
      <li>Works well, soap fits perfectly in bottom.  </li>
      <li>My wonderful children got it for me</li>
      <li>Awesome product for the shower and travel.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great!  </li>
      <li>Best part</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to any father looking for a good quality shaving mug to get the job done!</li>
      <li>Great mug for shaving.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This thing is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rubber, doesn&#x27;t look fancy but works great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Great mug, great price, and great quality</li>
      <li>It works great for working up a lather.</li>
      <li>Size is great for this job.  </li>
      <li>What a great product.</li>
      <li>Hi, This Is a great shaving mug.</li>
      <li>well - they do, and quite nicely!  </li>
      <li>Love the ring in the bottom of the mug - the homemade shaving soap the kids got me on Etsy fits perfectly in that ring and doesn&#x27;t shift all around in the bottom when building a lather.  </li>
      <li>It is real interesting to rap it on the granite counter and not get that &amp;#34;glass on glass&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Good durable shave mug.</li>
      <li>It is really good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>So by a quick re-purposing of two individually great products, it&#x27;s win-win for me!  </li>
      <li>Looks ok, works great - good lather.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Happy (and comfortable)</li>
      <li>I guess to hold up a shaving soap, but since I use the tube cream I can&#x27;t speak as to how effective that part of it is.  </li>
      <li>so I could warm it in the sink.</li>
      <li>A very handy cup to have, helps to keep the soap in one place neat and clean.</li>
      <li>DE shaving the old fashioned (sometimes still the best) way!</li>
      <li>When holding the handle, its very comfortable in the hand.</li>
      <li>It sits on top of the rim of the mug.  </li>
      <li>Frankly I love it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been dropped on steel decks and flung across my stateroom in high seas and still whips up some great lather.</li>
      <li>Fills the whole mug and then works really well for creating a wonderful lather.</li>
      <li>That being said, that ring works great against the bristle action of the brush to intensify the lathering.  </li>
      <li>I save my old TOBS containers (nice screw-on tops, they come in handy for a lot of things) - maybe, if those containers fit into the top of this . . .  </li>
      <li>Easy to grasp.</li>
      <li>It fits my hand well and is easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>WOW - now I know why a scuttle would be popular!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the Navy and therefore need something that can take a beating but still fit in a seabag.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>I bought this with the &amp;#34;Shaving Brush - Badger Shaving Brush with Premium Wooden Handle&amp;#34; on Amazon and both look great together.</li>
      <li>sound.  </li>
      <li>After researching scuttles, they aren&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
      <li>A cheap feeling cup make of plastic, no rubber involved.</li>
      <li>Warm shaving cream throughout the entire shave!  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;d set it aside for a while on the shelf, and last winter, I started to research scuttles as a way to keep my cream warm during the shave.  </li>
      <li>I thought I would shave in the shower more but simply prefer to do it over the sink now.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what it purports to be.  </li>
      <li>After using it for a few weeks I can say it&#x27;s plenty deep and big enough, works great with my tube shaving cream and brush to make a great lather, and I don&#x27;t have to worry at all about it breaking.</li>
      <li>I can work up a lather in this mug much quicker than in my old mug that was smooth on the inside.  </li>
      <li>And most seem to be ceramic, which took me full circle with why I bought this in the first place - potentially noisy and definitely breakable.  </li>
      <li>If you have large hands this will well.  </li>
      <li>And with all the hard surfaces in bathrooms now - tile, granite etc it&#x27;s a good idea.  </li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a gift, but I like it so much I plan to get one for myself eventually as well.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer indicated, it&#x27;s really, I think, made for soaps because of the ring in the bottom.  </li>
      <li>because this thing is all rubber, my brush isn&#x27;t making a whole lot of racket and getting all banged up in the process.</li>
      <li>Fits like a glove (careful as the excess water squeezes out as you push the container into the top of the mug).  </li>
      <li>This mug is really meant for lathering with the &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; soap.</li>
      <li>Finally I really like that when I am whipping up my lather,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
      <li>So now what I do is put the mug and the container into my sink as I&#x27;m filling it with hot water, then over the sink, with the mug mostly filled with water insert the TOBS (empty, mind you) container into it.  </li>
      <li>Sturdy and bigger than expected but not unwieldy, still fits nicely on the counter.</li>
      <li>My brush is able to dry out well because the mug&#x27;s large opening allows enough airflow around it even in the medicine</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for any one who considers themselves a man&#x27;s man.</li>
      <li>Who wants to start their day off dropping the shaving mug &amp; then having to clean up the mess.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it is exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>The rubber is pretty dense, but yet it is actually lighter than ceramic mugs.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it is actually rubber, feels more like plastic, but it didn&#x27;t really matter to me.</li>
      <li>I like that it will not break if you drop it and its plenty large enough to use with the brush.</li>
      <li>I am totally new to DE shaving, but after reading and researching for hours on all this new-fangled old fashioned shaving stuff, I finally settled on asking for this particular mug as a gift.  </li>
      <li>When looking for a shaving mug to take with me on deployment, I searched high and low because all I could find were ceramic or flimsy metal mugs.</li>
      <li>This product is tough and wide enough to swirl up a great lather.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s very well made and believe it will last a very long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big, green, unbreakable and the right size for the Semogue 1438 brush</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really take this one seriously (rubber?  really?)</li>

    <li> The only problem is that it floats.  I wish it were weighted heavily on the bottom so I could warm it in the sink.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the Navy and therefore need something that can take a beating but still fit in a seabag. When looking for a shaving mug to take with me on deployment, I searched high and low because all I could find were ceramic or flimsy metal mugs. Until I stumbled upon the Marvy Rubber Mug. This thing is great. It&#x27;s been dropped on steel decks and flung across my stateroom in high seas and still whips up some great lather. I liked it so much I now have two of them.</li>
    <li> Great mug for shaving.  The mug won&#x27;t break if you drop it and because of the tall walls, it holds the lather in the cup without spilling over.  The mug also have a raised bottom to keep the soap puck from sitting in any residual water.</li>
    <li> The Mug is as described...hard rubber and will not break or break other items when struck.  It is real interesting to rap it on the granite counter and not get that &amp;#34;glass on glass&amp;#34; sound.  My only problem is it will not fit in my medicine cabinet, (the door won&#x27;t close) so where will I keep it?</li>
    <li> Hi, This Is a great shaving mug. Not sure, but I think this is what the barber used back when I was a kid (late 50&#x27;s early 60&#x27;s).  I grate up two Van De Hagen pucks and then use the end of my shaving brush to compact it all down. Fills the whole mug and then works really well for creating a wonderful lather.</li>
    <li> This mug is really meant for lathering with the &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; soap. those round ones that you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;You can lather in it with the cream as well but it&#x27;s really meant for the round soap since it has the place to kinda hold the round soap in at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know this when I bought it at the beginning so w/e.. Not a big deal really.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll try to switch to the soap in the future and see how that works out.</li>
    <li> This mug should last a lifetime</li>
    <li> Good durable shave mug.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and bigger than expected but not unwieldy, still fits nicely on the counter. The price is what has me on the fence. I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great mug for homemade shaving soap! Best part it&#x27;s unbelievable! Love it!</li>
    <li> Big enough for the bigger soaps. Easy to grasp. It will hold soap from the Shave Den and Mitchell&#x27;s Woolfat soap.</li>
    <li> This thing is actually sturdier than it looks! The rubber is pretty dense, but yet it is actually lighter than ceramic mugs. I like that it will not break if you drop it and its plenty large enough to use with the brush. When holding the handle, its very comfortable in the hand. The one I currently use is ceramic with the knob instead of the handle...I am sick of that b/c it gives my hand cramps when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a gift, but I like it so much I plan to get one for myself eventually as well. I can&#x27;t wait to have an excuse to order one of these up for myself, might have to &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; drop the ceramic one.</li>
    <li> After breaking a couple of ceramic mugs, and getting tired of the racket that I&#x27;d inevitably cause with my brush (I get up earlier than my wife, and it always bothered me that the high pitch, loud clank would disturb her), I bought one of these guys after, as others have said, I gulped a little on the price, which seems a little steep for a rubber mug.  As another reviewer indicated, it&#x27;s really, I think, made for soaps because of the ring in the bottom.  YMMV, but I&#x27;m a TOBS cream fan and just personally prefer creams to soaps.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works fine with creams, though it&#x27;s a little deep for my shorter Simpson&#x27;s brush, and even my longer B&amp;B brush w/o the soap puck in the bottom.  So I&#x27;d set it aside for a while on the shelf, and last winter, I started to research scuttles as a way to keep my cream warm during the shave.  An idea hit me - I save my old TOBS containers (nice screw-on tops, they come in handy for a lot of things) - maybe, if those containers fit into the top of this . . .  well - they do, and quite nicely!  So now what I do is put the mug and the container into my sink as I&#x27;m filling it with hot water, then over the sink, with the mug mostly filled with water insert the TOBS (empty, mind you) container into it.  Fits like a glove (careful as the excess water squeezes out as you push the container into the top of the mug).  I then mix my cream in the TOBS container.  Size is great for this job.  WOW - now I know why a scuttle would be popular!  Warm shaving cream throughout the entire shave!  It&#x27;s great!  After researching scuttles, they aren&#x27;t cheap.  And most seem to be ceramic, which took me full circle with why I bought this in the first place - potentially noisy and definitely breakable.  So by a quick re-purposing of two individually great products, it&#x27;s win-win for me!  So if you&#x27;re a cream user, think about this item in a couple of ways.  Happy (and comfortable) DE shaving the old fashioned (sometimes still the best) way!</li>
    <li> What a great product. Simple and functional. There is a ring in the bottom of the mug to hold your soap. It works great for working up a lather. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rubber, doesn&#x27;t look fancy but works great.  And with all the hard surfaces in bathrooms now - tile, granite etc it&#x27;s a good idea.  Who wants to start their day off dropping the shaving mug &amp; then having to clean up the mess.  This won&#x27;t break or crack your tile floor.    I like the dark forest green color.</li>
    <li> Great! Indestructible!  If you have large hands this will well.  Buy it now!</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it purports to be.  Looks ok, works great - good lather.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping it.  I will buy another one if it ever breaks, but that will probably be in about 20 years.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Was not sure about buying a shaving mug made out of rubber but took the chance and I&#x27;m very happy with it and if needed again would buy again. But it&#x27;s very well made and believe it will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for the shower and travel.  This product is tough and wide enough to swirl up a great lather.  Highly recommend for any one who considers themselves a man&#x27;s man.</li>
    <li> Works well, soap fits perfectly in bottom.  Not sure if it is actually rubber, feels more like plastic, but it didn&#x27;t really matter to me.</li>
    <li> A cheap feeling cup make of plastic, no rubber involved.</li>
    <li> Perfect mug for me as I travel often for work. I have had several glass ones get broken. This one should not have the problem.</li>
    <li> Great product. No fear of dropping or breaking. Has lip to hold the Col. Conk&#x27;s shaving soap stable in the cup. Holds the lather well with only a wet brush.</li>
    <li> I broke my other shaving mug when it fell into the sink so I had to look for another one.  I didn&#x27;t really take this one seriously (rubber?  really?) but the reviews made me take a second look and eventually I ordered it.  Frankly I love it.  There&#x27;s a raised ring inside on the bottom that&#x27;s there I guess to hold up a shaving soap, but since I use the tube cream I can&#x27;t speak as to how effective that part of it is.  That being said, that ring works great against the bristle action of the brush to intensify the lathering.  I can work up a lather in this mug much quicker than in my old mug that was smooth on the inside.  After using it for a few weeks I can say it&#x27;s plenty deep and big enough, works great with my tube shaving cream and brush to make a great lather, and I don&#x27;t have to worry at all about it breaking.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the prettiest thing in the world and I wish the handle was larger for larger hands. Overall, it is exactly what I thought it would be. Cant break it. If you buy it for the shower then it will be what you want it to be I thought I would shave in the shower more but simply prefer to do it over the sink now. I don&#x27;t use it much but that is no reflection on this mug.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day and he loves it. It is really good quality for the price. I bought this with the &amp;#34;Shaving Brush - Badger Shaving Brush with Premium Wooden Handle&amp;#34; on Amazon and both look great together. I would recommend this to any father looking for a good quality shaving mug to get the job done!</li>
    <li> A very handy cup to have, helps to keep the soap in one place neat and clean.</li>
    <li> I am totally new to DE shaving, but after reading and researching for hours on all this new-fangled old fashioned shaving stuff, I finally settled on asking for this particular mug as a gift.  My wonderful children got it for me and I was ecstatic when I opened it!  It&#x27;s big, green, unbreakable and the right size for the Semogue 1438 brush they also got me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Love the ring in the bottom of the mug - the homemade shaving soap the kids got me on Etsy fits perfectly in that ring and doesn&#x27;t shift all around in the bottom when building a lather.  It fits my hand well and is easy to hold.  Finally I really like that when I am whipping up my lather, because this thing is all rubber, my brush isn&#x27;t making a whole lot of racket and getting all banged up in the process. Definitely utilitarian in design, but retro looking as well - looks like something my grandfather would have had in his bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t have a shaving stand, I made a brush holder out of some walnut I had in my woodworking shop - see attached photo.  It sits on top of the rim of the mug.  My brush is able to dry out well because the mug&#x27;s large opening allows enough airflow around it even in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great mug, great price, and great quality - I expect it to outlast me!</li>
