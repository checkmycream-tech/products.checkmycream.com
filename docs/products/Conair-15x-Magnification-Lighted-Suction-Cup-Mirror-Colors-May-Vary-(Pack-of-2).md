### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very Pleased!!</li>
      <li>Perfect for the over 40 crowd.</li>
      <li>Great for tweezing the brows and putting on eye makeup.</li>
      <li>I love the magnification and the size is perfect.</li>
      <li>its a good Mirror</li>
      <li>but its a good buy</li>
      <li>and it was smashed sometime on the way home (my own fault.)</li>
      <li>Buy a magnifying mirror by Tweezerman or Danielle - much better.</li>
      <li>The 10X works much better.</li>
      <li>I used it to look more closely at my face</li>
      <li>I want to get two more to send to my niece.</li>
      <li>The magnification is too strong.</li>
      <li>that it attaches to a surface, and that it has a light.</li>
      <li>The magnification is very strong, so one must get very close to the mirror to focus on the image.</li>
      <li>THIS MIRROr is like looking at a fun house mirror!  </li>
      <li>and I struggled to see the side, the top and bottom of my face very well.</li>
      <li>but u def need it super close to your face and eyes to see what you want to see  </li>
      <li>it is hardly worth it</li>
      <li>It also is too powerful.</li>
      <li>It has a nice magnification, but I was looking for something bigger.</li>
      <li>to only receive one mirror rather than the TWO that is in the description - would be nice to have the spare.</li>
      <li>They were bowed and that&#x27;s why you couldn&#x27;t see right.</li>
      <li>mirror - the light really isn&#x27;t needed and doesn&#x27;t help much at all.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
      <li>but this mirror is way too small for most everything!!</li>
      <li>you have to look very very close to the mirror</li>
      <li>Good little mirror.</li>
      <li>nice frame for this 15x magnification mirror, only wish the magnification was more clear, more defined, its just not precise like the tweezerman tweezermate magnification mirror is.</li>
      <li>and you can see only part of your eye and have to look for the spot that the reflection is not distorted, but, you can find what got into your eye :)</li>
      <li>I purchased this exact mirror years ago from a pharmacy.</li>
      <li>There are certain angles that cause blurriness.</li>
      <li>The little suction cups and kick stand are nice</li>
      <li>and I only use the light for eyebrows.</li>
      <li>The light is strong and the batteries are long lasting.</li>
      <li>I wear glasses and can only see if I hold this super close to my face at ackward angles.</li>
      <li>Brighter light and less magnification</li>
      <li>I really wanted the same mirror but had no luck at the stores</li>
      <li>If this mirror had been in a larger format, it would be much easier to use.  </li>
      <li>It works but there is such a small sweet spot where it actually magnifies 15x</li>
      <li>The light is not bright.</li>

<li> Too much magnification in a to little piece ! ! !</li>
<li> cant use it, have to be no more that 3cm away from it to see anything as vision is totally distorted</li>

<li> It made me &amp;#34;squint-eyed&amp;#34; a little, rsrs.</li>

<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> They were like a small version of a carnival mirror and gave me a headache trying to pluck an eyebrow.</li>
<li> I have bought several small magnifying mirrors to attach to our bathroom mirrors at home and this was the absolute worst!  </li>
<li> Can&#x27;t see in it and not handy or practical.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money !!!</li>
<li> It is either really poorly made or there was no quality control for this product at the factory.  </li>
<li> you can&#x27;t make out anything without horrible distortion.</li>
<li> These mirrors were terrible.</li>
<li> The worst.</li>

    <li> I ordered this product and was dissatisfied. The advertisement states that this is a package of two ! My order only had one mirror. The magnification is too strong. I am going back to using my 10x mirror.  Don&#x27;t waste your money !!!</li>
    <li> These mirrors were terrible. They were like a small version of a carnival mirror and gave me a headache trying to pluck an eyebrow. They were bowed and that&#x27;s why you couldn&#x27;t see right.</li>
    <li> you have to look very very close to the mirror and you can see only part of your eye and have to look for the spot that the reflection is not distorted, but, you can find what got into your eye :)</li>

    <li> maybe is you need something in a pinch but this mirror is way too small for most everything!! Can&#x27;t see in it and not handy or practical.</li>
    <li> nice frame for this 15x magnification mirror, only wish the magnification was more clear, more defined, its just not precise like the tweezerman tweezermate magnification mirror is.</li>
    <li> If this mirror had been in a larger format, it would be much easier to use.  Won&#x27;t use it daily due to size.</li>
    <li> I received my order - but there is only one mirror and NOT a package of two.  I find the price to be a bit steep for only one mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Nice mirror - the light really isn&#x27;t needed and doesn&#x27;t help much at all.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed to only receive one mirror rather than the TWO that is in the description - would be nice to have the spare.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a compact 15X Mag mirror with a light!. This exceeds my expectations! The light is strong and the batteries are long lasting. Very Pleased!!</li>
    <li> I have one of these mirrors in silver. I like its size, its magnification, that it attaches to a surface, and that it has a light. I want to get two more to send to my niece. The picture shows silver and nothing is said about selecting a color. What was sent to me was a pink one and a blue one. This will not do. I&#x27;m returning them.</li>
    <li> The magnification is not clear and it is hard to find on spot you can actually focus on. The 10X works much better.</li>
    <li> The light is not bright. Had to buy batteries because I thought it didn&#x27;t have one. 12 bucks later, I find out that it does. It also is too powerful. Brighter light and less magnification</li>
    <li> It works but there is such a small sweet spot where it actually magnifies 15x it is hardly worth it</li>
    <li> I can not figure out what or how to use this. I wear glasses and can only see if I hold this super close to my face at ackward angles. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> THIS MIRROr is like looking at a fun house mirror!  you can&#x27;t make out anything without horrible distortion.</li>
    <li> Too much magnification in a to little piece ! ! ! It made me &amp;#34;squint-eyed&amp;#34; a little, rsrs. And the suction broke in two days.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and i received two mirrors. It has a nice magnification, but I was looking for something bigger. There are certain angles that cause blurriness. I used it to look more closely at my face and I struggled to see the side, the top and bottom of my face very well.</li>

    <li> The worst. You can&#x27;t see into the mirror at all. Too magnified.</li>
    <li> Finally can see all my eyebrow hairs.  Perfect for the over 40 crowd.</li>
    <li> I purchased this exact mirror years ago from a pharmacy. I love the magnification and the size is perfect. I travel every week and it lasted years and years with me - only dying recently because I accidentally put it in the outside of my suitcase and it was smashed sometime on the way home (my own fault.) I really wanted the same mirror but had no luck at the stores so checked Amazon and found it! Bonus that it comes with second I can leave at home for next time. The little suction cups and kick stand are nice but I don&#x27;t use them - and I only use the light for eyebrows. Good little mirror.</li>
    <li> I had had one of the same and it broke when I dropped it.  I saw it on Amazon and knew that I once again had to have it.  Great for tweezing the brows and putting on eye makeup.</li>
    <li> its a good Mirror but u def need it super close to your face and eyes to see what you want to see  but its a good buy</li>
    <li> cant use it, have to be no more that 3cm away from it to see anything as vision is totally distorted</li>
