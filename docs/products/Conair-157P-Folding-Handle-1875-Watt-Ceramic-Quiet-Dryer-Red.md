      <li>Excellent value!</li>
      <li>Five years is great for a $20 dryer.  </li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>It is a good buy and works well at all settings.</li>
      <li>and I loved it.</li>
      <li>Also, the volume of air is great for drying, but not a \\&quot;hurricane force wind\\&quot; like so many others, so tangles are reduced.    </li>
      <li>I was very glad to get this hair dryer, they don&#x27;t sell them in the&lt;br /&gt;stores anymore.</li>
      <li>The unit is lightweight, and the folding handle is a nice feat too.  </li>
      <li>It is a good product though, works fine</li>
      <li>what more is their to say, but that it was a good price,  shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>It is very light to hold and the nozzle is shorter than most.  </li>
      <li>I love this hairdryer...</li>
      <li>its quieter than most</li>
      <li>This is just lovely.</li>
      <li>So far, so good!  </li>
      <li>I have hair to my mid-back and the handle tends to get hot when I&#x27;m blow-drying completely straight, but it is perfect for my needs and it matches my bathroom!</li>
      <li>love how it folds up as well, and the two extra attachments are a great bonus.</li>
      <li>It worked fine.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this thing and have not been able to find an equivalent replacement, would love to find where to but a new one of these.</li>
      <li>It was smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would have never guess I would find such a great buy for 20 dollars.</li>
      <li>I returned the hair dryer because the defuser didn&#x27;t fit on the dryer.  </li>
      <li>I have bought many hair dryers and this one, by far, is the best hair dryer for long hair.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t buy this brand again, even though it seems it&#x27;s generally gotten good reviews.</li>
      <li>It is much quieter than most hair dryers.</li>
      <li>The dual-voltage feature has been amazing, and has seen 4 different continents and every type of a power plug.</li>
      <li>I bought this in 2005 and loved it so much I bought another one in 2010 when the first finally started dying.  </li>
      <li>It actually makes my hair look better...</li>
      <li>I will need to return it soon because the hot handle feels like an unsafe malfunction.</li>
      <li>oh, and it dries my hair really well!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a quiet hairdryer and this satisfied all of my needs.</li>
      <li>This model is really quieter than all hairdryers I ever used before, and especially emits no annoying whistling or wailing noises!    </li>
      <li>not only is this dryer substantially quieter(not silent, but definitely quieter) than my old one, but the attachments are great, the buttons are in easily workable positions, and its lightweight.</li>
      <li>It worked fine the last time I used it, no warnings what so ever.</li>
      <li>It was fine, but after a short while the handle started heating up so much</li>
      <li>For the price and size, a pretty decent hairdryer for long hair and easy to store in the bathroom.</li>
      <li>I have never found another hair dryer that I like as much as this one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very quiet and does a fantastic job of drying and styling my hair.</li>
      <li>However, I guess the technology of the ceramic ions are really there, because my hair didn&#x27;t puff up much.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it closely resembled my most recent hairdryer that died of old age.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the dryer mainly for the way the defuser works on my hair.  </li>
      <li>On high.</li>
      <li>I had to go buy another new hairdryer.  </li>
      <li>It is more quiet then the other ones.</li>
      <li>It has recently started to have a very hot handle after using it for only about five minutes.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this hairdryer is lightweight or quiet, all the other ones I&#x27;ve had were lighter and made less noise, even more powerful ones.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it so far.</li>
      <li>I bought it mostly for the dual-voltage feature, but I&#x27;ve never travelled with it, because it&#x27;s too big and heavy for that</li>
      <li>I left my ConAir at home and had to use both my mother&#x27;s and my mother-in-law&#x27;s hair dryers , both of which nearly blew out my ear drums.!!!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t make me hot, and it dried my hair relatively fast.</li>
      <li>It looks pretty, it appears a real solution, but it´s not powerfull enough to dry my hair in a proper time.</li>
      <li>Thought the quiet feature (one I was desperately looking for) would be great.</li>
      <li>I have owned this particular hair dryer for several years now, and although I am purchasing a new one as my current model is on the fritz, I believe I definitely got my use out of it.</li>
      <li>It is relatively small for a full size hair dryer.</li>
      <li>The intake is covered with a thin filter mat, which effectively prevents sucking in any single hair and therefore never any smell of burnt hair in the room.  </li>

<li> I expected it to last longer.</li>
<li> As far as how quiet it is, I never really realized until this past holiday season.</li>
<li> I used to dry my hair en 5 minutes and with this one takes me triple....</li>
<li> so I think something got loose or misaligned.  </li>
<li> I have curly hair and it dries my hair in about half the time as my last dryer and using the diffuser it does not get fuzzy.</li>
<li> I traveled with him from college to back home and on vacation, but in a little over  a year it just died.</li>
<li> Total waste of money - don&#x27;t bother.</li>
<li> The quietest setting is \\&quot;low\\&quot; which is not warm enough to dry my hair.</li>
<li> I no longer have to worry about hurting my hears due to noise.  </li>
<li> Not as quiet as I had hoped, but am using this dryer every day for the past couple of years.  </li>
<li> Well, this morning (less than 10 mths from purchase)</li>
<li> Since the packaging had been opened before, I assume someone else had returned it previously.</li>
<li> I got this one a little over a year ago</li>
<li> it sizzled, sparked, smoked a little &amp; died...from the handle again.  </li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> So, knowing I would only get 50% refund + have to incure the return shipping fees, leaving a measly $10 or so - just not worth the headache!</li>
<li> I have really thick hair</li>
<li> I did get the concentrator attachment connected, although it was a little difficult to get on...</li>
<li> Not a good buy....</li>
<li> but the diffuser was impossible to attach.  </li>
<li> I stopped using hair dryers because I hated the fact they made my hair poof up and become frizzy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It is much quieter than most hair dryers. It is relatively small for a full size hair dryer. And it travels well. I have no issues drying my hair - and I have pretty thick hair. I would order another one if I needed to.</li>
    <li> Just purchased this today from Walmart.  I&#x27;ve tried every which way, and I can&#x27;t get the diffuser attachment to connect to the dryer.  I did get the concentrator attachment connected, although it was a little difficult to get on...but the diffuser was impossible to attach.  I will be returning this.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer...its quieter than most and it works faster as well. My mom actually owns like 4 of them also. It actually makes my hair look better...I&#x27;ve gotten 2 compliments on my hair since buying this hair dryer 2 weeks ago!</li>
    <li> Thought the quiet feature (one I was desperately looking for) would be great. It was fine, but after a short while the handle started heating up so much I couldn;t hold it properly (the palm of my hand would burn). So, knowing I would only get 50% refund + have to incure the return shipping fees, leaving a measly $10 or so - just not worth the headache! Well, this morning (less than 10 mths from purchase) it sizzled, sparked, smoked a little &amp; died...from the handle again.  Total waste of money - don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> It looks pretty, it appears a real solution, but it´s not powerfull enough to dry my hair in a proper time. I used to dry my hair en 5 minutes and with this one takes me triple.... Not a good buy....</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a hairdryer that won&#x27;t ruin your hearing, this is the perfect one to buy.  It&#x27;s very quiet and does a fantastic job of drying and styling my hair. I love it!!</li>
    <li> This model is really quieter than all hairdryers I ever used before, and especially emits no annoying whistling or wailing noises!    The intake is covered with a thin filter mat, which effectively prevents sucking in any single hair and therefore never any smell of burnt hair in the room.  The unit is lightweight, and the folding handle is a nice feat too.  Excellent value!</li>
    <li> I got this one a little over a year ago and I loved it. It was quiet for a hair dryer and dried my long  hair pretty well. I traveled with him from college to back home and on vacation, but in a little over  a year it just died. It worked fine the last time I used it, no warnings what so ever. Just stopped  working. So that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I expected it to last longer.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quiet hairdryer and this satisfied all of my needs. Even with 1875 Watts, it is amazingly quiet!</li>
    <li> I have bought many hair dryers and this one, by far, is the best hair dryer for long hair.  It is very light to hold and the nozzle is shorter than most.  Also, the volume of air is great for drying, but not a \\&quot;hurricane force wind\\&quot; like so many others, so tangles are reduced.    I have never found another hair dryer that I like as much as this one.  It&#x27;s quiet too.</li>
    <li> I like this product alot.  I have curly hair and it dries my hair in about half the time as my last dryer and using the diffuser it does not get fuzzy.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it closely resembled my most recent hairdryer that died of old age.  I owned this for a month before it died on my from having sucked in my hair and overheating.  My husband has even tried taking this apart with no luck.  We don&#x27;t even see the hair inside that damaged it.  I had to go buy another new hairdryer.  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Purchased the Conair 157P six months ago because I was looking for a very quiet hair dryer. The quietest setting is \\&quot;low\\&quot; which is not warm enough to dry my hair. The warmer setting is not especially quiet. It has recently started to have a very hot handle after using it for only about five minutes.  I will need to return it soon because the hot handle feels like an unsafe malfunction.</li>
    <li> I was very glad to get this hair dryer, they don&#x27;t sell them in the&lt;br /&gt;stores anymore. It is more quiet then the other ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for well over 7 years now, with nearly daily use. The dual-voltage feature has been amazing, and has seen 4 different continents and every type of a power plug. I absolutely love this thing and have not been able to find an equivalent replacement, would love to find where to but a new one of these.</li>
    <li> I have owned this particular hair dryer for several years now, and although I am purchasing a new one as my current model is on the fritz, I believe I definitely got my use out of it. As far as how quiet it is, I never really realized until this past holiday season. I left my ConAir at home and had to use both my mother&#x27;s and my mother-in-law&#x27;s hair dryers , both of which nearly blew out my ear drums.!!! It&#x27;s just as quiet as you can expect a hair dryer to be!</li>
    <li> I bought this in 2005 and loved it so much I bought another one in 2010 when the first finally started dying.  It started buzzing so I think something got loose or misaligned.  Five years is great for a $20 dryer.  I have hair to my mid-back and the handle tends to get hot when I&#x27;m blow-drying completely straight, but it is perfect for my needs and it matches my bathroom!</li>
    <li> This is just lovely. I have really thick hair and I used it on the low setting. Didn&#x27;t make me hot, and it dried my hair relatively fast. I stopped using hair dryers because I hated the fact they made my hair poof up and become frizzy. However, I guess the technology of the ceramic ions are really there, because my hair didn&#x27;t puff up much. It was smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how it folds up as well, and the two extra attachments are a great bonus. I would have never guess I would find such a great buy for 20 dollars. Awesome.</li>
    <li> not only is this dryer substantially quieter(not silent, but definitely quieter) than my old one, but the attachments are great, the buttons are in easily workable positions, and its lightweight. oh, and it dries my hair really well!</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  For the price and size, a pretty decent hairdryer for long hair and easy to store in the bathroom. Not the loudest or the quietest hair dryer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping all over trying to find a reasonably quiet hair dryer and I&#x27;ve finally found it!!! I no longer have to worry about hurting my hears due to noise.  I like the fold up handle too.</li>
    <li> I used this dryer for about 5 minutes a day, 3x a week.  On high. It worked fine.  Now 1 year later it is BURNING my hand while using it.  I cannot hold the handle anymore and it smells like burning.  Totally unexceptable in my eyes, a product that can hurt you after a year is one I plan to stay away from.  I won&#x27;t buy this brand again, even though it seems it&#x27;s generally gotten good reviews.</li>
    <li> I returned the hair dryer because the defuser didn&#x27;t fit on the dryer.  I purchased the dryer mainly for the way the defuser works on my hair.  Since the packaging had been opened before, I assume someone else had returned it previously.</li>
    <li> Not as quiet as I had hoped, but am using this dryer every day for the past couple of years.  It is a good buy and works well at all settings.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this hairdryer is lightweight or quiet, all the other ones I&#x27;ve had were lighter and made less noise, even more powerful ones. I bought it mostly for the dual-voltage feature, but I&#x27;ve never travelled with it, because it&#x27;s too big and heavy for that, so I ended up keeping it in the States and using a 230V one back in Europe. It is a good product though, works fine and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it so far.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife based upon reviews. It works, she likes it, what more is their to say, but that it was a good price,  shipped quickly.</li>
