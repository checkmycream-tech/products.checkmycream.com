### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>An excellent slipper for an inexpensive disposable.</li>
      <li>I should have known that you get what you pay for, at best!  </li>
      <li>Completely awesome and a very good deal!</li>
      <li>PERFECT!  </li>
      <li>Great purchase</li>
      <li>It was a perfect after-foot massage item!  :-)</li>
      <li>These disposable slippers are not quality made, but good for the amount and the price.</li>
      <li>Good for one-time use</li>
      <li>Good purchase.</li>
      <li>We are very pleased with our purchase.</li>
      <li>Great price and great for my large parties.  </li>
      <li>In fact, some guests have been swiping them to use at the gym or to leave by their own front doors.</li>
      <li>They are actually comfortable!</li>
      <li>Interesting travel item.  </li>
      <li>Quality is OK.</li>
      <li>I bought these for open house and they worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>but I was hoping it was more of a terry cloth material like the hotels.  </li>
      <li>The material is more like the gown that they give you at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>These are huge on me.</li>
      <li>Both men and women fit in them (can&#x27;t comment to the largest or smallest size they fit).</li>
      <li>I just tried out a pair of these myself to see how they fit.  </li>
      <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>it was cheap</li>
      <li>Even Will Some Light dancing, Comfortable And Weren&#x27;t  Slippery On The Hardwood floors</li>
      <li>Good enough for one use.</li>
      <li>Not a bad deal...</li>
      <li>They are great to have on hand especially when you are in a new hotel or apartment.</li>
      <li>However, the top strap is so loose my foot slides out the top of the shoe when I am walking.</li>
      <li>I see they reduced the price by $10 right after I made my purchase.  </li>
      <li>Sent these back and paid twice the price for ones that have more substance.</li>
      <li>Each pair is packaged individually so you could easily give them to neighbors and others if you have too many left over.</li>
      <li>They are far from plush but they have a good non-skid bottom even on wet tile flooring and they served their purpose well.</li>
      <li>Not even worth the new price.  </li>
      <li>They are a bit flimsy, but overall fine.</li>
      <li>- i thought these would be great for house guests who were staying for a few days, these are definitely meant for a salon who does mani/pedi&#x27;s</li>
      <li>My big toe did stick out in the right one, so I suppose a closed toe style would be better for women with small feet, but all in all I am happy to get these and save my new carpet.</li>
      <li>Although it holds up well during the day for normal use, if you put a lot of force on it, it&#x27;ll be ripped to shreds!</li>
      <li>One should never compare it with the regular ones because it is disposable.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging size (25 pairs) is just right.</li>
      <li>They are 100% non skid due to the rubber soles and that was the primary reason for my purchase, I have hardwood floors throughout and did not want any accidents with folks in their socks sliding about.</li>
      <li>These were about the same price (bought at $1 per pair) and are pretty substantial.</li>
      <li>They would DEFINITELY last a full day, perhaps several.</li>
      <li>They last much longer than you might expect.</li>
      <li>Way below those found in decent hotel (Intercontinental and the likes).&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the material is very low, thin and too large (Ok for big people, I</li>
      <li>Exactly the quality I expected and paid for.  </li>
      <li>I wear a size 6 1/2 - 7 women&#x27;s shoe, and while certainly larger than my feet, I had no trouble walking around my home in these.  </li>
      <li>Disposable...didn&#x27;t realize top would be such thin paper</li>

    <li> Made for large feet, will slip-off or become difficult to wear on small/average size feet (US 5.5-8).  Good for one-time use (it&#x27;s what they&#x27;re made for).</li>
    <li> Cheaply made.  Will last few days wearing it but not recommended for every day use.  Very little padding and the loop that goes over the top of your feet is very thin.  Although it holds up well during the day for normal use, if you put a lot of force on it, it&#x27;ll be ripped to shreds!</li>
    <li> Not a bad deal... the slippers are very thin and simple/disposable after a few rounds of use.</li>
    <li> for the money. what can you say. throw them away after a use or two.</li>
    <li> Interesting travel item.  Can also use for visitors.  They last much longer than you might expect.</li>
    <li> Way below those found in decent hotel (Intercontinental and the likes).&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the material is very low, thin and too large (Ok for big people, I guess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly not recommended!</li>
    <li> PERFECT!  Just what I wanted.  Exactly the quality I expected and paid for.  Arrived quickly - no issues at all!  We used at a reflexology party.  each lady everyone decorated theirs with markers provided.  It was a perfect after-foot massage item!  :-)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that these could made with cheaper materials. Was going to use for my beach rental and would be too embarased to display</li>
    <li> These are thin slippers.  It&#x27;s hard to see in the pictures - but it&#x27;s flat - looks like cardboard with a thin piece of paper.  I didn&#x27;t mind it - it was cheap but I was hoping it was more of a terry cloth material like the hotels.  The material is more like the gown that they give you at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> horrible quality - i thought these would be great for house guests who were staying for a few days, these are definitely meant for a salon who does mani/pedi&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I purchased them because we don&#x27;t wear shoes in our home. They are for our guests. They are a bit flimsy, but overall fine.</li>
    <li> Quality is OK. One should never compare it with the regular ones because it is disposable.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging size (25 pairs) is just right.</li>
    <li> I wear a ladies size 8 1/2. These are huge on me. They are disposable and so I knew they would be flimsy. However, the top strap is so loose my foot slides out the top of the shoe when I am walking. I buy &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; slippers because the foot lotion I put on after my bath ruins regular slippers.  I would not buy these again.</li>
    <li> These disposable slippers are not quality made, but good for the amount and the price. Good enough for one use.</li>
    <li> Toilet paper thin. Literally. You can see through the upper.</li>
    <li> I could never see wearing these or recommending them. I was very disappointed in the quality and the thin soles that make it nearly impossible to walk in the slippers. They feel like those disposable ones that the nail salon gives you after you&#x27;ve had a pedicure and forgotten your flip-flops.</li>
    <li> We are not normally a shoes-off household, but the weather around here has been crazy. Finally I got tired of the mud prints on the living room carpet, so on really bad days I ask people to wear these slippers instead. They are actually comfortable! In fact, some guests have been swiping them to use at the gym or to leave by their own front doors. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I just tried out a pair of these myself to see how they fit.  I wear a size 6 1/2 - 7 women&#x27;s shoe, and while certainly larger than my feet, I had no trouble walking around my home in these.  They didn&#x27;t slip off or move around.  My big toe did stick out in the right one, so I suppose a closed toe style would be better for women with small feet, but all in all I am happy to get these and save my new carpet.</li>
    <li> Completely awesome and a very good deal!</li>
    <li> I bought these for open house and they worked perfectly. Both men and women fit in them (can&#x27;t comment to the largest or smallest size they fit). They are 100% non skid due to the rubber soles and that was the primary reason for my purchase, I have hardwood floors throughout and did not want any accidents with folks in their socks sliding about. Each pair is packaged individually so you could easily give them to neighbors and others if you have too many left over. Great purchase and I have a few pairs left to use for guests in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought these for house guests, but I find that I always want to bring a pair with me when I travel.  They are great to have on hand especially when you are in a new hotel or apartment.</li>
    <li> Provided these for a get together so my guests  wouldn&#x27;t have  to walk around barefoot.. they all lasted the  night Even Will Some Light dancing, Comfortable And Weren&#x27;t  Slippery On The Hardwood floors</li>
    <li> Great price and great for my large parties.  We&#x27;re a no-shoes house and this gives my guests something between their socks and the floor.  Three starts because I don&#x27;t want to mislead anyone into thinking they&#x27;re luxury slippers... but they serve their purpose.</li>
    <li> Bought these to give to guests using our spa and immediately saw they weren&#x27;t what I would want to give to someone.  I should have known that you get what you pay for, at best!  Sent these back and paid twice the price for ones that have more substance.</li>
    <li> Disposable...didn&#x27;t realize top would be such thin paper</li>
    <li> Not worth the price.  I see they reduced the price by $10 right after I made my purchase.  Not even worth the new price.  They are advertised as having padding, but that is incorrect.  They tore the minute I took a step in them.  Poorly made, no padding, go for the more expensive versions.  They will last longer.</li>
    <li> Wanted disposable slippers to take with us on vacation. Had never heard of them before seeing a broadcast on TV about bedbugs and these were recommended to use as one way to help avoid bringing the bugs home with us. We used a different pair at every hotel and they went in the trash when we left. The longest we wore a pair was for 4 days and they held up well even after getting damp after showering. They are far from plush but they have a good non-skid bottom even on wet tile flooring and they served their purpose well. We have plenty left over for our next trip, too. I don&#x27;t think that I would ever wear them for everyday use, but to use as we did they did their job well. We are very pleased with our purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for visitors, as we have a &amp;#34;no outside shoes in the house&amp;#34; policy in our home. We tried the disposable paper ones, but returned them as they were just too flimsy to use. These were about the same price (bought at $1 per pair) and are pretty substantial. They would DEFINITELY last a full day, perhaps several. An excellent slipper for an inexpensive disposable.</li>
