      <li>I originally found it on.</li>
      <li>I really love the thought of Vegan products, but I just didn&#x27;t get a ton of volume, and it left kind of a residue on my hair.  </li>

      <li>I have used over half of the bottle without much improvement.</li>
      <li>The product was less mousse/foam and more liquidy, which made it hard to apply.  </li>
      <li>I have really fine thin hair</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine, oily hair.</li>
      <li>Works best on dry hair, let sit for at least a few mins, then blow dry hot with cold shot to finish (closes cuticles).</li>

<li> I have thin, fine, oily hair.</li>
<li> Works best on dry hair, let sit for at least a few mins, then blow dry hot with cold shot to finish (closes cuticles).</li>
<li> My hair feels a little fuller/thicker and seems to leave my hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
<li> so I ordered two - it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff and looks natural.</li>
<li> While my thin hair was slighty thicker, it did not look much fuller, and any thickness it produced did not last long.  </li>
<li> Careful to use too much, then hair gets dull and sticky.</li>
<li> So many products weigh your hair down, and/or just make it feel oily or dirty.</li>
<li> This foam is not as thick as other products but does a decent job managing your hair.</li>
<li> like I said, I&#x27;m wanting to find alternative products to use with less harmful ingredients...</li>
<li> Jonathan must have changed the formula because it does not give volume and body like my previous purchase from Ulta.</li>
<li> I used 5 pumps (4 yesterday and one today) and the bottle is already almost half way gone.</li>
<li> I have extremely thin hair and after using this product I could never go back to using anything but the infinite volume thickening foam!</li>
<li> It is hard to find</li>
<li> What a rip-off.</li>
<li> I have  used it for years and nothing comes close to the volume it adds to very thin hair.</li>
<li> Use sparinly as it is very expensive</li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard to find in stores!!!!!!!  </li>

    <li> The product was less mousse/foam and more liquidy, which made it hard to apply.  It left a film on my hair.  While my thin hair was slighty thicker, it did not look much fuller, and any thickness it produced did not last long.  I had hoped for better especially for the price I paid.  The only good thing -- I believe the product had no alcohol in it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thin hair and after using this product I could never go back to using anything but the infinite volume thickening foam! This product is amazing I recomend this product to anyone and everyone no matter what type of hair you have! My hair is the most beautiful i have ever seen it! You will regret not getting this product!</li>
    <li> Been using for about a month.  Pleased with the results. It gives my hair nice body and shine.  My hair feels a little fuller/thicker and seems to leave my hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Jonathan must have changed the formula because it does not give volume and body like my previous purchase from Ulta. It seems to be \\&quot;watered down\\&quot; and left my hair oily feeling instead of clean and bouncy.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a men&#x27;s magazine several years ago. The article was describing best products for men and Jonathan Infinite Volume Thickening Foam was listed as the best hair product to thicken fine hair. I have used it for years and it truly works great. It is costly in comparison to similar products but worth the extra couple of bucks.</li>
    <li> After hearing about this, I ordered and have tried to see what everyone was loving, but that being said, it&#x27;s just ok.  I really love the thought of Vegan products, but I just didn&#x27;t get a ton of volume, and it left kind of a residue on my hair.  I&#x27;m really wanting this to work for me, but so far, it&#x27;s just been ok.  I loved my other stuff from Big Sexy Hair, but like I said, I&#x27;m wanting to find alternative products to use with less harmful ingredients...guess I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday and it does not build up on the hair like some products tend to do .It is very lightweight</li>
    <li> 4 pumps combed into my hair is exactly what I need for the volume I lack. This stuff is amazing and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Best thickening product I have ever used.  I have  used it for years and nothing comes close to the volume it adds to very thin hair.</li>
    <li> I used 5 pumps (4 yesterday and one today) and the bottle is already almost half way gone. Why???????</li>
    <li> And believe me, I have tried just about all of them. I have thin, fine, oily hair. So many products weigh your hair down, and/or just make it feel oily or dirty. This gives you true volume, giving each strand the most bang for its buck. And the price here is SO much cheaper than on that TV shopping channel I originally found it on. Their price was $10 (!) more per bottle, plus they charge a small fortune for shipping!! What a rip-off. On Amazon I got free shipping because I ordered two, making my purchase price even better! This is all I will use now for a volumizing mousse. Experiment for yourself on how many pumps you will need; (I use 4) it will be different for eveyone based on hair thickness and length. You will love it. And Amazon is so fair on their pricing on this product.</li>
    <li> The Volume thinking form works well for me!</li>
    <li> Adds nice body and shine to my hair.  Would purchase again.  Use sparinly as it is very expensive</li>
    <li> This foam is not as thick as other products but does a decent job managing your hair. Careful to use too much, then hair gets dull and sticky.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I have purchased this item previously and was very happy with the results, leaves hair smooth and shiny without leaving a greasy feel or look.  Gives hair volume as stated on the product!</li>
    <li> After watching Jonathan&#x27;s reality show, I felt confident that anything with his name on it had to be top notch.  I have used over half of the bottle without much improvement. To be completely fair, I have extremely thin and fine hair. I will give anything a chance. I tried Jonathan but it didn&#x27;t work out for me. I could get the same results with any drugstore brand.</li>
    <li> I have really fine thin hair and this is the best product I have ever used on my hair..It gives my hair the appearance of being full. Its light and fluffy and it stays great and it doesnt leave a film on your hair. I have tried so many products only to throw them away and lose that money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  It helps give my soft, fine hair some much needed volume. It isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff and looks natural.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is thick but very fine and this product gives just enough boost to hold the style throughout the day. It is hard to find so I ordered two - it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! Feels and smells wonderful in your hair. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair.  It is fine but quite thick.  This product not only gives me great lift without weight, it isn&#x27;t sticky or thick like other foams.  Would definitely recommend this product if you need a root lift.</li>
    <li> Smells divine.  Doesn&#x27;t give me tons of volume, but it does add some.</li>
    <li> Great product for thin hair</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff works great and smells wonderful!  Go buy it it&#x27;s hard to find in stores!!!!!!!  Just love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, have been using it for years! I&#x27;ve got very fine hair and think this is the best thickening product I&#x27;ve used to date. Works best on dry hair, let sit for at least a few mins, then blow dry hot with cold shot to finish (closes cuticles).</li>
