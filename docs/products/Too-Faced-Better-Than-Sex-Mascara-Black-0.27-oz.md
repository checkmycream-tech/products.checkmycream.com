<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Definitely thickens lashes - but two coats can look a bit slutty for work environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as my lower lashes almost touch the top of my cheeks, it does smear a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I use it for nights out on my upper lashes only.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good mascara, but not for the price. I&#x27;ve seen $8 mascaras that do the job or even better than this one. Kind of hard to apply at times</li>
    <li> Amazing mascara , does wonders for your eyes!</li>
    <li> I expected much more coverage and volume.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Returning to Ulta today. Leaves flakes under my eye which is not okay considering the price of this mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this mascera. I noticed an immediate difference in my lashes! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this mascara as I didn&#x27;t have a ton of past experience with Too Faced before trying it.  I also thought the name of the mascara set pretty high expectations for how it would work, but I found myself impressed.  For context, I have blonde lashes that are rather sparse and stubby.  This mascara works well for me as it seems to add both volume and length. I also found its longevity to be comparable to similar mascaras from other prestige brands.  As with every beauty product, it&#x27;s no miracle, but it does work quite well and is a nice mascara for both everyday and evening wear.</li>
    <li> What can i not say good about this product?  It is the answer to all lash issues!!  Volume! Length! Curl!  It&#x27;s AMAZING and worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Worst mascara I have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> This mascara is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve tried at least 15 different types of mascara, including Kat von D&#x27;s mascara and sephora&#x27;s mascara. This one tops them all! My eyelashes look amazing after using this. I have long eyelashes naturally, but they aren&#x27;t very thick. This mascara makes them even longer and very thick. If I put a curler and this mascara together my eyelashes almost look like falsies. This mascara is the best!</li>
    <li> I am aware the price is astronomical, but this product is worth EVERY penny. Delivers amazing volume, and I love the flared wand applicator.</li>
    <li> I liked this mascara, but with daily use i guess the tube and materials is very cheap because the part that cleans the mascara off the brush broke on 2 of my tubes. I got a couple weeks use out of each. Not buying this again, too expensive to keep buying every couple weeks after it breaks. I will stick with maybelline.</li>
    <li> It keeps my eyeslashes very long and curled. Obsessed with that part about it! It works great but it flakes so bad. Everytime I look in the mirror I have tiny little black dots all under my eyes. So annoying!</li>
    <li> This is my second tube, having received some for a Christmas gift.  I love it.  I have used the younique brand previously and been disappointed...even think it took some lashes with it.  So I was presently surprised with this mascara.  It is easy to remove (coconut oil my chosen way) and it appears to be healthy on my lashes.  The significant length and thickness are indeed noticeable.  While I may try to find it at Ulta for a cheaper price, I will be looking for it again.</li>
    <li> The best thing ever. I have sups sensitive eyes burn and everything. And this mascara is good for me so 👍</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a amazing product .</li>
    <li> Part of my most recent Glossy Box offering and I&#x27;m so glad I had the opportunity to try it.  I like my lashes to look thick and this mascara does the trick.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> I am so obsessed with anything that comes from this brand but this mascara is the worst mascara I have ever tried. First, it is not waterproof nor do they offer it an alternative. I have oily eye lids and this mascara runs after only one hour of application. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to any one that has oily lids and honestly it definitely doesn&#x27;t do anything dramatic to your eyelashes. #sorry</li>
    <li> By far my favorite mascara.  It makes my lashes look thick and long.</li>
    <li> I have very sparse, shorty eyelashes and I&#x27;ve tried every mascara under the sun. You only need 1-2 coats starting at the base and then working your way up to get amazing results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! It&#x27;s so easy to apply and gives my lashes so much volume. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of it in my Glossy Box. I&#x27;m thrilled at how great it works. My lashes haven&#x27;t looked this long and full in years. I&#x27;m not sure how they do it -- it looks like any other mascara. The people who have it rubbing off under their eyes should use it only on the upper lashes. Use a lesser mascara on your lower lashes.</li>
    <li> No this is not better than sex. I&#x27;m assuming some virgins created this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;This smears all over your eyelids and has no staying power.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just an over priced mascara with a gimmicky name.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this but I was was left wondering what kind of sex the people over at two faced are having. Cuz this mascara sucked. Left my lashes clumpy, lumpy, and flakey. I had to apply it then use my fingers to separate lashes then run a clean brush thru my lashes to take out any additional clumps. Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for all that. Returning!</li>
    <li> https://www.amazon.com/review/review-your-purchases/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_rev_shipment_o04_s00?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asins&#x3D;B004RT4HI6&amp;channel&#x3D;YAcc-wr#</li>
    <li> I already have pretty long lashes so my only requirement for a mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes. This mascara does make your lashes look nice, but it smudged under my eyes within an hour of application, and after I&#x27;d clean the smudge off my face, it would smudge again. All. Day.&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift, I would never purchase a mascara this expensive considering drugstore mascaras work alright (much better than this one). My lame $5 tube of cover girl masc beats this one</li>
    <li> Best Mascara ever!  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  But better than sex?  LOL</li>
    <li> I would give it a 4.5... It creates long and full lashes the first time you use it... love the thickness... looks great</li>
    <li> 4.75 stars&lt;br /&gt;I am super picky about my mascara. I originally bought Too faced LashGasm and totally disliked it, so I took it back to Ulta and they recommended I try the Better Than Sex. I was told if I didnt like it I could bring it back, it was only 2 dollars more so why not?&lt;br /&gt;Omg I love it! One coat makes my eyelashes amazing, shoot if I two theyre just amazing and thick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara works better than my false eyelashes. The price is a bit steepl but im a firm believer in you get what you pay for. I have already recommended this mascara to everyone</li>
    <li> Istarted using mascara a year ago.  It works better than every mascara I have ever used.  thank you cindy rickman  harleyccr38@gmail.com</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the hype is all about. I was so excited to receive this but boy did it clump up quick. Now I just put this over a coat of my covergirl and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara - worth the price!</li>
    <li> LOVE this mascara. It was recommended to me from a friend and I will use this as long as it is available! Goes on easy and really separates the lashes.</li>
    <li> Great but leaves flakes too soon</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I&#x27;ve used the Younique brand for over a year and wanted to try something new but still had the same effect. This is a much better replacement into my daily beauty routine. It&#x27;s give full, thick, long lashes that last all day. I don&#x27;t have any issues with it flaking off or smudging. Highly recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> I really like the effect I get from this mascara. It definitely elongates and adds volume to my lashes. However, this is the first and only mascara that has ever given me raccoon eyes. A few hours after I apply it, I have dark circles under my eyes that look hideous. I have used countless mascaras as I am always looking for the next best thing, and this is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had that causes me dark under eye circles. I won&#x27;t buy this again as the price point is much too high for me to look like a zombie after applying it.</li>
    <li> Trying to perfect is so that I don&#x27;t get clumps</li>
    <li> It worked way better than I thought.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara! It truly makes my lashes longer &amp; softer than any other brand of mascara I have tried. It is also super easy to wash off. I will only buy Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara from now on! ☺️</li>
    <li> I bought it at the mall the first time and loved the mascra. When I ordered it on line it wasn&#x27;t like anything I had bought. It had hardly any in it. I will not order makeup on line again. Sorry!! I love amazon and the way it was delivered but the I will not order this again.</li>
    <li> This mascara does very well at coating each individual lash.  I&#x27;ve tried many mascara brands with my Glossybox subscription and this one glides on so smoothly. Wish it was cheaper on Amazon.  Bought it for $23 at Ulta.</li>
    <li> This is just the best mascara I have ever worn.</li>
    <li> i absoulutely love this mascara goes on so well only need two coats and my lashes look fuller and longer and does not clump at all.......two thumbs up for sure</li>
    <li> Eyelashes look huge, does cause a bit of clumping.</li>
    <li> This mascara makes your  Eye lashes look like you were using the prescription drug that makes your eye lashes grow. It&#x27;s my new favorite product</li>
    <li> Found it at Ulta for cheaper. This product is amazing!!! I have used many mascaras and this one separated all my lashes, added volume, and made them super long! I am forever a fan of this stuff and so glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Best Mascara ever and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!  It goes on thick and it lengthens the lashes.  I almost feel like I am wearing false lashes.</li>
    <li> Great product fast ship</li>
    <li> It;s clumpy and doesnt stay on your lashes.  If you want racoon eyes then this product is for you.  I am sorry that I wasted $36.00 on this.</li>
    <li> Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara is my absolute favorite mascara of all time! I use this mascara every time I do my makeup. It is definitely my go to mascara. This makes my lashes look full and long without making them look clumpy. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more! I have tried several high end and drug store mascaras, and this is by far the best in my opinion. Too Faced is a great brand, and this mascara really helps showcase what quality they offer!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found many mascaras that I absolutely love- until I found Too Faced Better than Sex mascara. I ran out and had to use a back-up (Avon) and after a month without Too Faced, I had to get it again. The wand makes my eyelashes pop! I never had any issues with clumping. The only con is that it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as other mascaras.</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing!! It really does what it says it would. Makes my lashes look amazing long and thick.</li>
    <li> For reference, I prefer thick, bold, dramatic lashes.  The way this mascara was described to me, I was led to believe it should have delivered.  Here was my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A LOT of product comes from the tube onto the wand.  It&#x27;s an inordinate amount.  Despite my proclivity toward big, bold, lashes, I found myself scraping the wand on the edge of the bottle to take the product off the wand so I could put it on.  Application to the top lashes was easy enough, but the product wanted to clump quite a bit.  The wand is....oddly shaped.  It doesn&#x27;t need to have that funky curve in the middle.  It doesn&#x27;t add anything to my experience by the wand having a curve in the middle.  Detail work on the bottom lashes, inner corners, and outer corners was impossible without blotting off the extra product.  Even then, clumping was a slight issue.  NOTE, this was a BRAND NEW mascara.  Clumping should not be an issue for a brand new mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product dried quickly.  It was very black, slightly matte in color.  It made my lashes stand straight out from my eyes.  I felt I should use an eyelash curler for the first time in 10 years because of the way my eyelashes dried on the first eye.  The second eye looked a little better thanks to the curler, but the lashes were still off my crease awkwardly.  Note, I never use an eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear:  The mascara lasted less than 8 hours.  After that, it began to crumble and flake.  It didn&#x27;t bleed, thankfully.  It just flaked off. It flaked off worse and faster than Clump Crusher.  That has to be some sort of record when you out fail a drug store mascara.  This stuff is NOT CHEAP and it&#x27;s awful after only a few hours.  I really, really wanted to love this mascara but I&#x27;m back to Benefit until I can find a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side - easily removes with soap and water.</li>
    <li> This is literally the best mascara that I have ever used. It makes my lashes long and full and they really keep their shape. My lashes usually go straight forward and usually dont stay curled but with this I dont even have to use a curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is a dream come true and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST MASCARA EVER.  I HAVE HAD SEVERAL COMPLIMENTS ON MY LASHES, I NEVER GET COMPLIMENTS.  THIS MAKES YOUR LASHES LOOK LIKE THEY ARE SUPER LONG.  YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.  I AM HOOKED ON IT!</li>
    <li> I got this mascara from a sample travel kit at Sephora.  I love it.  I use a few different kinds of mascara depending on what I am trying to achieve.  This is by far the best top coat mascara.  It makes my lashes look full and rarely clumps (although clumping happens on occasion).  It almost looks like I am wearing false lashes, in a good way.  It&#x27;s also easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Too Faced \\&quot;Lash Injection\\&quot; masacara, and I have also tried their \\&quot;Better Than False Lashes\\&quot; system (not a fan).  I am pretty sure they changed the formula on the Lash Injection a year or so ago, it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  The \\&quot;Better Than Sex\\&quot; mascara is awesome, I would choose it over any of the other Too Faced mascaras, as well as many other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gets five stars from me and I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> gave this to a friend and she too thought this was a fabulous mascara. The brush is amazing. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used several higher end mascaras that I would fall in love with and they would be discontinued. I have long but thin lashes so I am always looking for something that will make them fuller without clumping or getting too heavy. This is it! It doesn&#x27;t flake off into my eyes after hours of wear the way cheap products do, the brush is cleverly designed to get your outer lashes without smudging onto your eyelid, and the viscosity is perfect. Hope they keep this one around for me to continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Hands down THE BEST MASCARA EVER!!! Little expensive for mascara, but WORTH EVERY PENNY! Ulta and sephora are cheaper than amazon, though...</li>
    <li> Pretty good mascara, except it does clump when applying.</li>
    <li> The only thing that would make this mascara even better would be if they made it waterproof.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Fast service. Just tried it to see. I&#x27;m my opinion works the same as regular mascara.  But overall I&#x27;m happy!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with the length of my lashes, but they&#x27;re pretty sparse.  This mascara is AMAZING. One coat and I had super thick lashes, it almost looked like I put on single false lashes in the spots that are normally separated and bare. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, and I can&#x27;t speak to the other review that said it runs out fast or dries up, but I have searched far and wide for a mascara that volumizes as promised and this stuff delivers more than I hoped.  I&#x27;m a lifer!</li>
    <li> I do not know why everyone thinks this is the greatest mascara. It clumps and and didnt do anything special. Maybelline Greatlash is way better.</li>
    <li> best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.....my lashes never looked so good and full....I would recommend this mascara to any female who wears it ....almost don&#x27;t need any other make-up once applied</li>
    <li> BEST MASCARA EVER!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The name describes it all! The matte pink and gold packaging of the mascara along with the name are definitely great marketing because they sucked me in as I know they have many other women.&lt;br /&gt;At first I had to try it because of all of the hype out there for Better Than Sex. I love every other Too Faced product I had tried so I wasn&#x27;t too worried about spending this amount on a mascara, because I didn&#x27;t have any reason to doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the shape of the wand, it&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t seen before. Most wands are either straight or curved whereas this one is shaped similar to a barbell. It&#x27;s bigger, gets smaller and then gets bigger again. Rough analogy, but it&#x27;s the first thing that came to mind when I was trying to describe it.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara itself goes on smooth not clumpy and I typically apply two coats to achieve the fullness I&#x27;m looking for. It stays on and in place all day when I&#x27;m at work which is all I could ask for in a mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I even purchased this in the travel size to keep in my purse throughout the day JUST IN CASE something were to happen for example weather, crying, etc.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this ,especially after it was highly recommended, but.... it was very clumpy/goopy, (I can handle that, I applied it very carefully, used a fine tooth eye brush/comb to comb out clumps AND used my beauty blender to carefully clean up any &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; left by the very thick and difficult to use brush) What I couldn&#x27;t handle was the &amp;#34;eye buggers&amp;#34; it left in the inside corners of my eyes every time I&#x27;ve used this AND that it smudged/smeared very badly after about 4&#x3D;5 hrs of wear every single time I wore it.  The reason I gave it 2 starts is that its not all bad.,.....it  did dramatically plump up my very thin/sparse lashes, really did look like I had on false lashes, will use this for special occasions (knowing I will need to take frequent trips to the ladies room to monitor its wear, and be prepared for touch ups). For every day use I will continue with my bare minerals mascara.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on TV.  They said it was great.  It did not work for me because it flaked off from my eyelashes onto my face.</li>
    <li> Brush is too big and messy.  It causes lashes to clump together and you can&#x27;t apply from lash line to ends...the brush is just too big.  It doesn&#x27;t lengthen or define - it&#x27;s just too messy.  An awful product.</li>
    <li> Very nice mascara. The pink packaging is cute and the hour glass shape really does help the eyelashes. I love this item, so happy i got it for my birthday!</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s nice, I compared it to my other mascaras I got for half the price and it wasn&#x27;t that much better.  I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> I tried this mascara and at first was pleased but then it started to get dry and flakey and I hated it. The brush is nice and it goes on well,but it seemed to dry out and make my lashes flakey and I stopped using it and went back to using loreal mascara</li>
    <li> Great mascara! A little pricey but does what it says! Beautiful heavy tube makes you feel like a princess. Delivered on time very happy with seller.</li>
    <li> i feel bad because my order come with out cover its like not original and i cant use it</li>
    <li> at first this product is great. Only after a few weeks of using it, the consistency of the mascara turned to a runny liquid that could not be used. It looked great when I first used it though</li>
    <li> I received a sample in a Glossybox and loved it as soon as I tried it.  My lashes and fine and short and this mascara lengthens and thickens better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many brands.  I&#x27;ve had no irritation or flaking and it lasts all day.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This was the first &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; mascara I have ever bought normally I just stick to drug store mascara. This by far is the best thing ever!! It is a little thick and you will want to be really careful applying it because there tends to be a lot of product on the wand. I have really thin and short lashes and it makes my lashes look amazing! At first I said I would use my drugstore mascara for just running errands and save the good stuff for special occasions but I don&#x27;t I wear this stuff everyday!!! Cannot say enough good things about it!!!</li>
    <li> Not worth $1 wishing I would have gone to the dollar store. Instead of this purchase. For sure.  I know</li>
    <li> Makes my eyelashes look longer and curlier.</li>
    <li> After using a multitude of different mascara through my many years, I have found one that is truly worth raving about.  This one glides on smoothly, does not glob, does not leave raccoon eyes at the end of the day, and does the job it advertises.  I get fuller and longer lashes that look great.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  Will order again and would definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent mascara! Stays on without smudging and really thickens and lengthens your lashes.</li>
    <li> From day one I was happy with this purchase. It is pricey but does give a look of false lashes. Yes the maybelline mascara are just as good but spurgle a lil and get the Too Face.</li>
    <li> I first heard about this mascara when I was returning a mascara that i was dissatisfied with.  the sales lady told me to check out a new mascara they had just stocked called, \\&quot;better than sex\\&quot; i was taken aback for a minute because of the name! that is claiming a lot. but i was in a hurry to leave at the time so i didn&#x27;t check it out.  months later i&#x27;m perusing the aisles of a macy&#x27;s beauty counter and found it.  i put on about two coats on one eye and was amazed at the contrast between that eye and the eye that i had already had a good mascara on.  my lashes looked so thick and voluminous I knew i had to buy it.  I&#x27;ve had it on for a few hours now and feel it doesn&#x27;t smudge or rub off, and i still have a curl to my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i definitely recommend this product.  if a product can make my sparse, thin, flat asian lashes look curly, plump and beautiful, i am sure if can make yours look great too!</li>
    <li> I had really high expectations of this product considering the brand and price.  Flakes and smudges if you even breathe hard!  NOT worth the price.  Unless, of course, you&#x27;re going for that cracked out raccoon look.</li>
    <li> Order this mascara, yes it&#x27;s a little pricey, but you will have the most FABULOUS EYELASHES EVER!  I had heard a lot about this from a couple of friends and thought they were blowing their views a little out of proportion.  Finally I relented after seeing them wearing it and was sorry I didn&#x27;t order it sooner!</li>
    <li> The best of the best!!</li>
    <li> The brush carries so much mascara on it that it is almost impossible to do more than one coat...and that coat sticks lashes together and clumps. This looks like it could really be a fantastic brush...maybe the problem is with the mascara, but the two together just make a mess of my lashes. I have been on a mission to find the best mascara for my lashes for over a year, and this is NOT one of the better ones. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Goes on with amazing results.  Up close you see clumping. An hour later, it looks like you NEVER put anything on!!!  It&#x27;s also NOT waterproof!  I live in Florida, so the moisture/rain- doesn&#x27;t work with this mascara!</li>
    <li> Curled my lashes n made them thicker n longer. I would definitely recommend this product without hesitation. Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> my all time favorite mascara. Makes lashes look HUGE!</li>
    <li> This product did not do anything different to thinken my lashes. I have naturally long lashes and get better results from a very popular green &amp; pink bottled mascara from the drug store. This product was very clumpy the very first time it was used and I am not impressed at all!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from the mascara that I brought from my local drug store.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite mascara ever. Ever. I am always on the lookout for new mascara. I have literally gone through over 10 brands in less than 6 months searching for mascara. Mac is my second fave (haute and naughty - but its a little wet), then I&#x27;d probably put They&#x27;re real by benefit (longer, but still thin lashes, and the product runs out quickly, not wet which is nice). I&#x27;d name a few others but they are too wet and you have to be very careful with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... This stuff is a little wet but if you&#x27;re paying attention its not too hard to maneuver (only have this issue with my bottom lashes). I have very thin lashes and they are also very short. I actually don&#x27;t look like I have lashes at all without mascara. But this stuff really makes them POP. I think people have issues with it because they rush to put it on making it a clumpy mess. But I coat my lashes THINLY and evenly twice and I don&#x27;t have any issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when I really want to be extra dramatic I use lash genius by anastasia as a primer before putting better than sex on. WOW!!!! :-) Hehehe, I really do LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product but the wand is way too big. I was unable to put it really close to my eye out of fear it would smudge all over my eye. Also the mascara runs, I have never had mascara run like this before ever. It was honestly gross. I looked in the mirror on the lunch break and my mascara was smeared all under my eye. Btw I work in an office, so I rarely have to fix my make-up.  I gave it two stars because my lashes were very voluminous and the mascara didn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> luv the case......hope my stepdaughter likes it for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I disliked this mascara.  It was too thick and would flake within an hour of wearing.  Will never buy again especially at the high price!</li>
    <li> This mascara is just okay.  I wouldn&#x27;t turn it down if someone gave it to me for free, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay for it again.  It&#x27;s great at first, but after a short time you end up with dark dust all under your eyes.  It&#x27;s also flaky so the comfort level is low.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara!!</li>
    <li> I applied this mascara to only one eye so I could compare it to the other eye with no mascara. I wasn&#x27;t impressed. My lashes didn&#x27;t seem much longr, fuller, or darker than my eye without mascara. Three hours later I checked my eye and the mascara had completely flaked off, leaving uglt black flakes under my eyelid. And the lashes were the same length and volume as the eye wirh no mascara. Wow!  Didn&#x27;t look great too begin with, and was a mess within three hours. What a waste!  I expected a lot more from a mascara called Better Than Sex. Heck, my Maybelline Define a Lash, which I can get for about six bucks on sale with a coupon, is waaay better than this piece of junk mascara. My suggestion is to avoid this mascara.</li>
    <li> any positive reviews must be from employees of the company.  two words for this product: racoon eyes. now if that is the look ur going for than far be it for me to stop you. however, for the rest of the population i would strongly suggest AGAINST this product. they sell a generic 3d mascara at ross that is waterproof and has the same effect on extreme lengthening of the lash but without all the flaking and smearing and smudging that this crap does.  Literally within the first hour ur lashes will start to flake and the &amp;#34;ashes&amp;#34; will spread all over ur lower lid and cheek bone. it is actually embarrassing if you are somewhere important as ull end up wiping the rest of ur makeup off just to get the mascara flakes off. several girls i work with have had the same exact experience so i highly suggest finding a generic 3d waterproof mascara!</li>
    <li> Much Better then store bought for sure. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This mascara is just okay. i got it today and was excited to try it because i&#x27;ve heard such good things. it did not hold the curl AT ALL. yes it provides a lot of length and volume but i could see it flaking after blinking twice. It&#x27;s very mediocre and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was told it was a bestseller and difficult to keep on the shelves, but I must say I was very disappointed with it. It turns under my eyes black, and it&#x27;s also a very wet formula so it clumps extremely easily. Now it&#x27;s just taking up drawer space. A definite regret</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used by far</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $30.</li>
    <li> This is my go to mascara.  I receive a lot of compliments on how long my eye lashes are because of this product.  It does dry out quicker than your run of the mill grocery store product BUT it is worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I compared this to my sister&#x27;s Better Than Sex Mascara, which was purchased in a Sephora, to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a fake. The packaging is identical, as well as the applicator. This is the real deal. I love it! I think you can find it cheaper in store though :p</li>
    <li> I heard really good things about this product and since I have been on a mission to find my goto mascara I figured why not. So I splurged and spent nearly $30. Which is alot for me for mascara. But I figured it was worth it. Well I am not sold. I agree with others the formula is very thick and heavy. It isn&#x27;t horrible it just isn&#x27;t what I was looking for in a every day mascara. It will definitely add some volume to your lashes. I don&#x27;t favor the style of brush. It goes from big to small to big. I am not convinced this mascara has earned its name.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MASCARA. I&#x27;m really picky when it comes to a mascara; however, this one is perfect! I recently bought it after returning &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; Mascara for being too harsh. It gives the appearances of fake lashes without having to deal with glue and lashes! I bought this product from ulta for $23.00 and got a travel size with it. The price on here is a bit steep. I would def recommend this to all and everyone I know!</li>
    <li> I love the mascara, but the thing that takes off the excess mascara somehow broke and now stays on top of the brush. Thankfully, I bought the package that came with the travel size and I can use that.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a mascara and this is it!  I bought it last night and I am loving this one!  I love the shape of the wand, the packaging is so pretty and it works amazing!!</li>
    <li> One of the best mascaras. I ever used honestly</li>
    <li> Bought it for my sister and she loves it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST MASCARA IN THE ENTIRE WORLD</li>
    <li> Product was unsealed when I received it, Buy it at Sephora it&#x27;s  GREAT!!</li>
    <li> Great mascara.  It&#x27;s not shipped in the original package.  All in all it&#x27;s my t favorite and it was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Initially, I loved this mascara, especially the brush!  However, after only using it a few times, I noticed  it would flake on my lashes and flakes would end up under my eyes. Definitely not worth the money. PS I still use the brush on my other mascaras.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have found and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
    <li> My own lashes are so sparse and short even before the aging process took hold.  I had begun to get eyelash extensions but they were so expensive and it seemed that I would have an eyelash malfunction before an important event.  I saw these advertised on a show and thought what the heck.  I think that people fall into one of two camps with this mascara.  The first is like me and feeling that one coat is great for everyday use and looking like I actually have lashes and with two or three coats watch out! I have even been known to sleep in it and then when I clean my face in the morning just get the raccoon from beneath my eyes and go out into the world.  The second camp are those people who experience flaking.  I had a little mild flaking the first time I applied but it wasn&#x27;t bothersome and it hasn&#x27;t been an issue since. I am a fan for life.</li>
    <li> Wand was broke when I opened it more reviews said this but I did not read before I bought shipped back</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE...brings out my green eyes</li>
    <li> Beautiful going on, that&#x27;s the 2 stars. I have blond thing short lashes. Made my eyes pop! After a few hours it would flake &amp; bother my eyes. No rubbing though! After 12 hours nothing left on my lashes (I do not have oily skin) &amp; looked like a raccoon. I paid no much at Soph</li>
    <li> Hate the name; love the mascara. Very dramatic but real looking.</li>
    <li> Quick ship and just what I wanted!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara. It has never let me down. If you&#x27;re wanting to splurge on one product, I definitely recommend this be the one!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this mascara because I have heard such good things. It is good mascara, it makes my lashes look really good....but I find that before the day is even out I have dark lines on my upper brow left from the mascara on my lashes sitting against that part of my brow and rubbing off. ALSO, this is pretty pricy mascara, it certainly isn&#x27;t cheap, and I feel like it is pretty low on the amount of mascara in the tube and it will run out quickly and dry out sooner, not cool considering how much it costs. So in conclusion, this does have a good affect on my lashes, but considering the other things I&#x27;m not sure if I will get it again.</li>
    <li> I like what the mascara does for my lashes. It volumizes and lengthens well and helps me get that fanned out look with just one coat. That being said, it is dry and flakes on me a lot and starts to irritate my eyes after a few hours of wearing it. It makes my lashes feel hard and I don&#x27;t like that. I also find that it clumps more than comparable products and sometimes a LOT of mascara comes out on the brush. Overall a good mascara, especially if you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes, but I prefer They&#x27;re Real! by Benefit.</li>
    <li> This mascara is super great when you want thick, sexy lashes. It slightly lengthens, and lasts quite a while before fading away. I usually put this one, then Blinc Mascara over it to &#x27;lock&#x27; it for over 12 hours of gorgeous wear. This is my favorite combo for every day  :)</li>
    <li> Not a real difference in length if you have really short lashes. It also smears. It would probably work better if it was water proof.</li>
    <li> I am crazy about mascara, and this is in my top three!  I really like long separate lashes; I don&#x27;t like the look of chunky/clumpy lashes.  If you are looking for long and separate lashes, this is totally for you.  The wand has longer bristles and really coats each lash.  Now this formula is on the drier side, especially compared to drug store brands.  I think the drier formal helps prevent clumping, but that is only my opinion.  Since it is a drier formula you need to power under your eyes, just to prevent transfer.  I don&#x27;t find a problem with the mascara transferring, but I read a few reviews where that was a problem.&lt;br /&gt;This formula also doesn&#x27;t have an odor, where as many drug store products do.  I will be keeping this in my collection and rotation for sure! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I took a chance ordering the Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara. I saw it recommended on Pinterest and figured I&#x27;d at least give it a try since I have been on a never ending search for the perfect mascara. The first application of this mascara and I was in love. The before and after was extremely dramatic, I&#x27;ve never seen my eyelashes look so amazing. I also didn&#x27;t need to reapply it later, which I normally have to do with other mascaras. I am absolutely thrilled with this purchase and would recommend it for anyone that want&#x27;s dramatic lashes. The only negative would possibly be if you want something more subtle (for whatever reason). I&#x27;d love to get a smaller size of this mascara to keep in my purse, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> makes my lashes voluminous and dramatic without looking like clumpy. is a very easy formula to work with and is buildable.</li>
    <li> this mascara flakes during the day so I do not like it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok and looks great at first. I wanted to love it because it&#x27;s a little cheaper than 3D Fiber Lashes Mascara but the flaking is a deal breaker for me. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara of all time</li>
    <li> I already have long lashes, but this really gives me more volume and more of a pop!</li>
    <li> It really is that good!  This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump at all and it feathers out each lash!! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the thick, long tarancula eyelashes it gives me! It can get a little bit clumpy but I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
    <li> I did not like this mascara at all. Goes on thick and clumpy, what a mess. Would not recommend to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product!  Easy to use, the brush is shaped right and you only need one coat.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s half empty. Rip off</li>
    <li> This mascara took over my life! The name is so true. If you like natural non spidery lashes this is NOT for you! If you like long, thick, volumized, glamorous lashes this is for you. It is like fake lashes in a bottle. Use 1-2 coats for amazing lashes. It is like jordana best lash extreme but waterproof and feels a lot better. It is very watery, by no means is it dry. It isn&#x27;t the best on bottom lashes but it&#x27;s better than most. On the top lashes it&#x27;s the best thing ever, you seriously can&#x27;t get lashes that look that good with any other mascara. It doesn&#x27;t rub off your lashes easily so you can wear it all day. The brush is really awesome it pinches in the middle, sort of an hour glass shape. Hands down the best mascara ever.</li>
    <li> I feel like I have tried every brand of mascara and I love this one.  Long, thick lashes with no flaking!!</li>
    <li> I spent about 30 minutes in Sephora trying to figure out the perfect mascara for me. I have long lashes, but I never feel like they have volume.  I told the girls that I don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;tarantula eyes&amp;#34; and she suggested this.  I do agree that this mascara gives me quite a bit of volume, but I could do without all the clumping.  In addition to the clumping-forget crying or sweating! This will run like no mascara I have ever used! (On the plus side-it is SUPER easy to remove while washing your face!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is an okay mascara. I feel that I have gotten just as much volume from Revlon and Covergirl mascaras, so I would probably save money next time....or I would spend a little more and get a better quality mascara-Trish Mcevoy, for example. That stuff is AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly! I love this mascara</li>
    <li> Favorite mascara! Big and bold !!! Fast shipping also</li>
    <li> Better than sex is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used it almost daily since I&#x27;ve got it about a month ago. I have tossed my cobra mascara to the side for now. Better than sex mascara lengthens and curls to a perfect, cute babydoll eyelash look. Not only does it create the best babydoll look you can imagine, it lasts all day! If you have short, light colored eyelashes like I do, this is the perfect product for you!</li>
    <li> I find that I only have to  apply one coat of this mascara and it looks like two!  It can get &amp;#34;gloppy&amp;#34; on your lashes, tho, but the glops come off easily with an eyelash comb.  I read other reviews that it runs....nope, haven&#x27;t see that.  And it actually comes off with make up remover easier than the Clinique mascara I usually wear.  I find no irritation with it either.&lt;br /&gt;The tube gets a little messy and has to be wiped off after each time you take out the wand, but that&#x27;s a minor thing. All in all, I like this mascara and will probably buy it again, but hopefully I will be able to get it in my local Sephora store so I can save the $8 shipping. It seems to be sold out each time I&#x27;ve tried to get it there.</li>
    <li> dried out! so disappointed</li>
    <li> now that i&#x27;ve used this mascara a couple of weeks i&#x27;d like to officially lay down the low down.  i bought this product because i&#x27;m in love with &amp;#34;graveyard girl&amp;#34; .  graveyard gird is this lovable young character that has quite a following on u tube.  i think most of her viewers are in their teens but for some weird reason her persona managed to suck my old croon &amp;#34;ness&amp;#34; in.  i&#x27;m 57.&lt;br /&gt;remember when you were young and had all those long lashes?  you could sleep in your mascara and get up and do a quick eye wipe and off you went to school still looking fabulous ?  well that ends in the 40&#x27;s .  and basically what your left with are little teeny wennie soft wefts of fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that is what i&#x27;m working with in hopes of .....sigh....... younger days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this mascara from the get go comes on CLUMPY.  I had to put emphasis on CLUMPY because thats what it does.  You have the option of wiping the excess of on tissue or just kinda rubbing the applicator tip against the rim of the mascara container to level things out.  once you&#x27;ve done this application is pretty easy , and the first coat is pretty good.  i use a second but i also have to use a separate brush to create a natural look.  so...... well so far the same as pretty much all other brands.&lt;br /&gt;now the real pi##er about this 23.00 dollar tube of goo is that when applied to the lower lashes within about two or three hours you look like you were just resuscitated from a drunken cryin&#x27; binge.  and why oh why does no one ever tell you things?  friends dont let friends get around with lipstick on the teeth , or smeared mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mind you, i had only applied on itty bitty coat to the lower lashes.  and so with that i will venture onward with this tube of 23.00 dollar better than sex magic stuff.  and when its over and done with like its name refers to ...... i&#x27;ll say goodbye and never look back.  Dont waste your money big girls!</li>
    <li> Best mascara!!! I&#x27;ve tried everything , this is the best!</li>
    <li> It rubs off under your eyes.</li>
    <li> The only bad thing about this product is that it slightly flakes, but after about 8 hours, so it&#x27;s pretty good. Not a fake, and i love the brush!</li>
    <li> Nice black and total coverage.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t even come in the manufacturer&#x27;s box! Just rolling around by itself in the shipping box. I&#x27;m kind of grossed out because I&#x27;m not positive that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product. It&#x27;s dented and looks used! Very disappointed! I will definitely be returning it!</li>
    <li> I thought it was pricey for the prouduct</li>
    <li> I will never go to any other mascara again.  I love the wand brushes, it really does a great job enhancing my natural lashes!</li>
    <li> made around my eyes breakout</li>
    <li> The best mascara ever this thing does wonder to my eyes you don&#x27;t have to wear falsies with this one coz its that good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that at the end of the day sometimes it flakes but not that bad</li>
    <li> Really great mascara!</li>
    <li> I generally stay clear of mascara that isn&#x27;t waterproof due to fears of it running in the rain and such. However, Better than Sex mascara is so worth the risk. My eyelashes generally suck, and one coat makes them look okay, two makes them look super amazing. I will totally be wearing this regularly despite its not being waterproof, just because of how amazing my eyelashes look. I have also found it fairly easy to apply with minimal glops.</li>
    <li> I love it. Really makes lashes long and lush. Looks great!!!</li>
    <li> Clumpy. not happy with</li>
    <li> The name of this product is so perfect! I have barely any eye lashes but when I put this mascara on, my eyes look great! Even if I&#x27;m in a rush, I just throw on some of this mascara and BAM, I&#x27;m ready to go. After a few weeks it will get a little clumpy or run dry, I add one or two eye drops every few days to keep it fresh. It lasted me an extra month just by adding some eye drops! Curl your lashes a little right before applying and you will be super pleased!</li>
    <li> ok mascara, definately not better than sex</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product based on the reviews.. However THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE HYPE!&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is really flaky and rubs off easily! Plus the suction on my tube broke.. TWICE! Luckily ULTA replaced it no questions asked but after the second time it broke I just got my money back! For such a pricey product I would expect a lot more from it!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST MASCARA ON THE MARKET! IT GIVES LENGTH, VOLUME, AND THE LOOK OF FALSIES WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY WITH THE MESS OF LASH GLUE! I USE THE PRODUCT DAILY!</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever  !!! First I love you Amazon you are my go to for almost everything but this mascara is selling for $25 I purchased at sephora but I guess for the convenience of not having to go out I wld pay the $31 now with that being said this mascara is amazing I use 3 coats as I do with most of my mascara and it&#x27;s like having falsies on , if this is the look your looking for buy this , you will not be disappointed! And it&#x27;s easy to come off . I have been using the magic glove for removing makeup (glides off with water ) as most women we spend so much on makeup remover so deff look into that it works great !!! Back to the mascara I have finally found my holy grail mascara , and I have tried from Chanel to Revlon !! This mascara 👍👍👍👍👍👏👏</li>
