    <li> Ordered this for a gift. I love it and I know my friend will also. It is very roomy and nice to look at also. I even ordered a complete set in blue for myself. The suitcase is great and big enough for out of town travel. The two cosmetics cases are just I wanted. Love it all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my upcoming trip for a convention. These are perfect to store my items in and I can fit them in the suitcase, they are a perfect match to my suitcases as well! Very cute and roomy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bags arrived with a normal new item smell. I&#x27;ve read on different designs of these bags that people toss them out because of the smell or return them, which there is no need to do either. There are simple ways to let the new smell air out, I found ways just by googling up different ways to help the smell fade faster.</li>
    <li> I love these. I travel a bit these are big enough for makeup personal things ect: Well made and super cute....</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE  GREAT QUALITY!!! Also take a look at the size! They are very generous! Everyone who sees mine loves and wants them! Makes a great gift! I will be ordering again for sure!</li>
    <li> I order the Cosmetic Train Case Toiletry in Pink/Zebra and the order that I got doesnt look anything like the default picture, I was planning on sending it back but im like forget it, so all im asking is what Train Case Cosmetic Toiletry 2 Piece Luggage Set has the green inside,hard spaced box, with zippers in the front,because mines lack all of that...</li>
    <li> I really like this item; it is well made and sturdy.  It is just too big for what I need.  I wish it was smaller - I would keep it if it was.</li>
    <li> I love this toiletry kit.  It&#x27;s made well, and I get a kick out of looking at it.  You can&#x27;t really go wrong for either an adult or a child.</li>
    <li> I had to return these.  I bought them for a gift but the smell was more than a little SO i RETURNED THEM.</li>
    <li> I thought these were going to be small but they are way bigger than I expected. I like that is sturdy and not flimsy or weak. I have a lot of nail polishes plus mani &amp; pedi tools &amp; it holds up. It can fit a lot in them &#x3D;]As for the stench ppl are talking about on here, to me is not a big deal. It&#x27;s not strong, unless you put your nose against it, lol</li>
    <li> its looks beautiful and very roomy holds a lot of stuff have had a lot of compliments on it i sell Prue romance and i put my stuff in these to carry every where and i have used them for vacation as well very handy</li>
    <li> it is prefect，i love it very much，it worth the value ，to choose it is very right，you will need it，come on</li>
    <li> Ordered this set and its wonderful..cutest thing ever as I love pink and zebra prints and for the price..worth it..strong enough and material appears easy to clean..got lots of compliments..even went back and ordered the gym bag to match it..</li>
    <li> I use these everyday and for travel I use them for my make up and hair stuff and they&#x27;ve held up really nice</li>
    <li> These are perfect. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and own a boatload of stuff - much of what I like to take with me when I travel.  These cases are strong enough that I can use one as a &#x27;train case&#x27; and carry it onto a plane without worrying that it will tear or get smooshed.  They&#x27;re each large enough that they will hold the makeup I want to take as well as cleansers, moisturizers, eye makeup removers, q-tips, etc. I was worried that they would smell &#x27;chemical-y&#x27; but there&#x27;s no odor.  I&#x27;m SO glad I ordered these.  Plus, they arrived in 2 days.  Thanks, Amazon &amp; SilverHooks!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for cosmetic cases to keep my makeup in... This was a great purchase! Not only stunning but two cases! I use the larger one for my storage and the smaller one for my daily makeup! I love the zebra and pink print too!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect items to go w/my luggage. Lots of space &amp; great products</li>
    <li> Love the size. The color is perfect. Got these to go out of town next month and i can not wait to use them. I am thinking of buying some more as gifts for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This review is very late.  We have had this set for a few months and LOVE it.  Excellent quality for the money.  You won&#x27;t regret purchasing.</li>
    <li> I love these, just what I expected.</li>
