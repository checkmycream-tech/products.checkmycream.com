      <li>This did not weigh my sons fine hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
      <li>My hard to please teenage son has hair similar to mine, and he lets me know as soon as he runs out of this great hair product.</li>
      <li>old.</li>
      <li>This shampoo did better than that, is not so hard on my scalp or skin, and keeps my hair from being so dry and crisp-feeling.</li>

<li> This shampoo did better than that, is not so hard on my scalp or skin, and keeps my hair from being so dry and crisp-feeling.</li>
<li> But it did not help much with managing and conditioning my thick curly hair.</li>
<li> Every experience I&#x27;ve had with a 2 in 1 shampoo left me with dry, rough feeling hair EXCEPT this Redken brand.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really formulated for men with medium to thick or coarse hair, who don&#x27;t need to shampoo everyday.</li>
<li> A very expensive bottle of shampoo/conditioner that doesn&#x27;t do anything better than other brands of shampoo/conditioner combinations.  </li>
<li> Convenient for traveling too, as the bottle is not large at all.</li>
<li> The bottle is a little small, but if you have short hair</li>
<li> A combination shampoo and conditioner for men who don&#x27;t want to mess with a lot of bottles in the shower.</li>
<li> This is a tricky combination, because a conditioner can leave my hair limp.</li>
<li> Redken for men is preferable quality, the smell is not cheap.</li>
<li> I have had to use prescription strength dandruff shampoo for so long to keep my scalp from itching so badly.</li>
<li> I have thin hair that needs a volumizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
<li> i just wasn&#x27;t crazy about it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Of course we all have different hair, but for me...this is the best shampoo/conditioner I have ever used. The only problem is...you can&#x27;t find it at CVS, Walgreens, Wal Mart, grocery store, etc. I have to order it from Amazon if I want it.</li>
    <li> the product is try good, the issue is the scent. i just wasn&#x27;t crazy about it and there&#x27;s no store where you can find it and redkin does not offer any kind of sample. it&#x27;s scent is very specific and string and either you&#x27;ll like it from the start, or, like me, you&#x27;ll stick it under the sink and regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> Overall good shampoo with nice fragrance. But it did not help much with managing and conditioning my thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love the spice ceder smell :D</li>
    <li> Works great, smells great</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son...he&#x27;s happy with it...2nd purchase now, still likes it. RK always makes great products, I&#x27;ve been using them for 30+ years...starting a second generation satisfied customer. Son has thick full bodied hair and don&#x27;t like taking time for using shampoo and conditioner,,,,this fills the need nicely and smells good. Sons age 25 yrs. old. RK is top shelf.</li>
    <li> A win win on my subscribe and save. This lasts 2 months for 2-3 people using it daily. This did not weigh my sons fine hair down or make it look greasy. Redken for men is preferable quality, the smell is not cheap. Unlike the highly perfumed drugstore smelling products available at grocery stores.</li>
    <li> Not completely sure it is worth the price, but it does produce a nice lather and I like the scent.</li>

It smells great, actually conditions your hair and you can tell it&#x27;s non-damaging after using it. The bottle is a little small, but if you have short hair it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for many years - due to its very pleasant and wife-loving smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price was Much cheaper than going to a salon to grab a bottle. Will order again!</li>
    <li> I have had to use prescription strength dandruff shampoo for so long to keep my scalp from itching so badly. This shampoo did better than that, is not so hard on my scalp or skin, and keeps my hair from being so dry and crisp-feeling. A great shampoo for men and worth it if you have the same problem I had.</li>
    <li> Good quality product you can trust! It does the job with excellent results with great experience you will have. Try it!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair that needs a volumizing shampoo and conditioner. This is a tricky combination, because a conditioner can leave my hair limp. This shampoo is my favorite, and I love the smell. My hard to please teenage son has hair similar to mine, and he lets me know as soon as he runs out of this great hair product. I can always tell when he uses another type of shampoo...his hair doesn&#x27;t have the sheen or body that it has with the Clean Spice.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Husband says it is great to combat dandruff</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner has a nice smell, does not dry out the hair like other products and overall is a quality product, as most Redken products are. Convenient for traveling too, as the bottle is not large at all.</li>
    <li> Actually this shampoo was for my husband. His hairdresser used it at the salon and he really liked it. Has been using it ever since!</li>
    <li> The spicy scent did set me back at first, the cleansing action and the tingly feeling it leaves are great.</li>
    <li> A very expensive bottle of shampoo/conditioner that doesn&#x27;t do anything better than other brands of shampoo/conditioner combinations.  Paying for the name I suppose.  I expected a lot better performance for the price.  I would not recommend this to product to anyone.  A rip off.</li>
    <li> Redken has done it again! A combination shampoo and conditioner for men who don&#x27;t want to mess with a lot of bottles in the shower. It&#x27;s really formulated for men with medium to thick or coarse hair, who don&#x27;t need to shampoo everyday. If you have fine hair this product won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Price is great and service was excellent</li>
    <li> Wish they made a body wash. Love the scent</li>
    <li> What is it about this shampoo that makes my husband want to use it exclusively?? What? It has a very strong fragrance so be warned.</li>
