      <li>Wig is pretty and long and curly and great for the price.</li>
      <li>(to the top of my butt (im 5&#x27;1 3/4&amp;#34;)) and its super soft.  </li>
      <li>right length color is what I t looks like lo e love.love</li>
      <li>It was also super soft and didn&#x27;t have that &#x27;cheap shiny wig&#x27; look.</li>
      <li>I bought this wig for a cosply of my favorite book and movie The Last Unicorn.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>shedding the first seconds of being on my head</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s pretty and is a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>Good wig for storm, lady death or any other character who has sliverish hair was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t look like the photo but its wonderful</li>
      <li>Gets tangled PRETTY DARN easy if you don&#x27;t have an actual wig comb; trust me.</li>
      <li>The wig is very long (touches the top of my butt-</li>
      <li>It sheds rather easy and its frustrating, but still looks nice.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping,</li>
      <li>Thank you so much</li>
      <li>Very Satisfy Customer here.....</li>
      <li>(Looked too much like xmen storm than a blind ninja lol)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very silvery white colour which is exactly the colour</li>
      <li>The curls are also much more defined in real life than in the product picture, which I personally don&#x27;t like so I chose to brush them out slightly, which added to the whole &amp;#34;frazzled&amp;#34; thing.</li>
      <li>But I dyed it a light wash of lilac and cut it due to the fact that it wasn&#x27;t the shade of white that I necessarily wanted (it&#x27;s more grey than white), nor did I like the style for the costume</li>
      <li>Maybe not as wavy as pictured, but the hair is soft and the built-in strap helps hold it in place.</li>
      <li>you plan on wearing it frequently, I would suggest going with another wig.</li>
      <li>I love the silvery white color, however the hair is QUITE thin and the weft is easily visible unless you&#x27;re very careful.</li>
      <li>other eise, im very please.</li>
      <li>Only downside is that is barely fits on my over-sized 57 centimeter (23 inches) head.</li>

<li> have a small  forehead tho and had a bit of trouble keeping the front down enough to cover my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
<li> The color is slightly gray.</li>
<li> its a little thinner than i</li>
<li> wouldnt waste my money on</li>
<li> My daughter is heavily into cos-play and loves this wig.  </li>
<li> I ended up cutting off several inches to get rid of the frazzled ends.</li>
<li> I had to squeeze it on with all my thick hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Yes you can tell it is fake.</li>
<li> It is an unrealistic color to begin with.</li>
<li> get me wrong, if you have time to style and give the wig attention</li>

    <li> I love the silvery white color, however the hair is QUITE thin and the weft is easily visible unless you&#x27;re very careful. It also tangles ridiculously easily and the ends get frazzled quickly when you brush it- I ended up cutting off several inches to get rid of the frazzled ends. The curls are also much more defined in real life than in the product picture, which I personally don&#x27;t like so I chose to brush them out slightly, which added to the whole &amp;#34;frazzled&amp;#34; thing. Overall, it&#x27;s okay. Wish it was thicker, but I can always buy a second wig and sew the two together.</li>
    <li> It sheds rather easy and its frustrating, but still looks nice.</li>
    <li> Love this wig. Very beautiful but takes forever to be shipped.</li>
    <li> so i love this wig! it came in good time. the colour is great, just the right amount of silver and grey. im using it for amathyst from steven universe. the length is great. (to the top of my butt (im 5&#x27;1 3/4&amp;#34;)) and its super soft.  though,the thickness is my only problem. its a little thinner than i though, the bangs arnt as full as i would have liked. though pleacing and styling should fix that. other eise, im very please.</li>
    <li> Curlier than I anticipated, but an overall good looking wig!</li>
    <li> Using this wig for a mlp Trixie cosplay and for a last unicorn cosplay. The wig is very long (touches the top of my butt- I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4) and brushes pretty easily. I brushed it all out then braided it to keep it from knotting. At first I was a little upset because it looked very thin at the top, but once I put it on, you could hardly tell. Definitely more silver than any thing else. Very good.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this wig for a cosplay, and when I opened the package I loved it. It&#x27;s a very silvery white colour which is exactly the colour I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;After wearing once or twice I noticed that it was shedding A LOT. The front hair line thinned out so the wig cap was visible. The once beautiful curls turned into a ratty mess, and the part was unmanageable.  I&#x27;ve had to start cutting length from the bottom since trying to brush it out just causes more hair to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if you have time to style and give the wig attention it is very beautiful and I got a ton of compliments in it!&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on wearing it frequently, I would suggest going with another wig. But if you plan on wearing once and a while this should hold up!</li>
    <li> Very nice, long wig, below my bra line. However, there are no adjustment straps in the cap, it is sewn for a smaller head than mine. Fast shipping, Ordered May 22, arrived June 9th.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a cosply of my favorite book and movie The Last Unicorn. Wig is pretty and long and curly and great for the price. Only downside is that is barely fits on my over-sized 57 centimeter (23 inches) head. I had to squeeze it on with all my thick hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kitty-ears.com</li>
    <li> Love it plan on using it for my comic con costume this year no complaints from me. Good wig for storm, lady death or any other character who has sliverish hair was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t look like the photo but its wonderful</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. Tangles are manageable, all around gorgeous. Comfortable, photogenic, not flat or shiny, perfect cosplay wig. 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Favorite wig I ever bought. (Great price!)</li>
    <li> Gets tangled PRETTY DARN easy if you don&#x27;t have an actual wig comb; trust me. But it&#x27;s pretty and is a lot of hair. But I dyed it a light wash of lilac and cut it due to the fact that it wasn&#x27;t the shade of white that I necessarily wanted (it&#x27;s more grey than white), nor did I like the style for the costume I&#x27;m going for to a convention. (Looked too much like xmen storm than a blind ninja lol) But it&#x27;s still nice quality for the price!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it she uses the wig for cosplay</li>
    <li> Used a part of a Mira Jane Strauss of Fairytail cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;Did not fall apart.</li>
    <li> Ok just ok. Great for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very Satisfy Customer here.....&lt;br /&gt;Gonna Enjoy wearing it for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;It feel good and very easy to put on........</li>
    <li> Fits great little long.in front but able to trim to right length color is what I t looks like lo e love.love it</li>
    <li> Great wig.&lt;br /&gt;Hair was a beautiful color and hung very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I have a small  forehead tho and had a bit of trouble keeping the front down enough to cover my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy one again, maybe just with a bang.</li>
    <li> As soon as i put the wig on it tangled and feels like plastic&lt;br /&gt;very uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;and shedding the first seconds of being on my head&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt waste my money on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an avid wig wearer, but I&#x27;ve got to admit I was pleased with this purchase. Yes you can tell it is fake. It is an unrealistic color to begin with. The bangs will need trimmed. The color is slightly gray. Spray wet and comb from bottom. From here just recurl by twisting hair around finger. I did wait a good 3 weeks from purchase date so if needing for event make sure to order with time to spare.</li>
    <li> I love it! Thank you so much</li>
    <li> The item perfectly corresponds at the one in the picture:)</li>
    <li> I love it! It arrived a day before expected and at first I was a little worried because it appeared grey inside the package but after I took it out it was perfectly white (not snow white but just what I needed)! It was also super soft and didn&#x27;t have that &#x27;cheap shiny wig&#x27; look.</li>
    <li> Customer service working with this product is incredible. I got use out of this wig for a couple days but had some trouble with knotting, and when I commented on that fact the customer service contacted me personally and told me they were passing this comment along for improvement if the prudent. They were excellent and kind and even though I was dissatisfied with the product, they still cared about the small detail I noticed!</li>
    <li> My daughter is heavily into cos-play and loves this wig.  Quality is good. Price is great. I would recommend this to anyone looking for this style.  The silver color is beautiful.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend, and she loves it!! She already has white hair but this is her &amp;#34;instant weave&amp;#34; Although it does get tangled fairly easily and was a whole lot more curly than the one in the picture, it looks good and is nice :)</li>
    <li> excellent quality and super soft!</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig! Very good quality for the price. Maybe not as wavy as pictured, but the hair is soft and the built-in strap helps hold it in place. I could wear it even with my waist-length hair! I would certainly buy more from this company. I can&#x27;t wait to use this for my Jack Frost costume this Halloween. :)</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and good quality.</li>
    <li> Wig was beautiful, it knotted up after two wears.  Looked very elegant</li>
