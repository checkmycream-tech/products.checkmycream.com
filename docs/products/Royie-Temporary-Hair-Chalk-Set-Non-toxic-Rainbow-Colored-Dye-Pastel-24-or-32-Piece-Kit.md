      <li>Product works great</li>

      <li>She loved it</li>
      <li>This looked good when I was done, but there were a couple of things that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>Everyone who sees my pup has loved.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t come with excellent primary colors...</li>
      <li>The product is semi-difficult to use on hair, requiring a fair bit of skill and patience.</li>
      <li>The colors are brilliant, and it washes out easily.</li>
      <li>and it showed up great but remember you need to color on something to make sure you break the seal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is best to wet the chalk to get the best effect.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s okay!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I love this and would suggest it!</li>
      <li>The colors are really bright in my hair which I love.</li>
      <li>the colors did not seem to bleed, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>Nice color assortment</li>
      <li>have medium brown colored hair and all of the colors show up nicely.</li>
      <li>received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
      <li>Was impressed with the number of colors but not so much with the size of the sticks.</li>
      <li>The blues showed up nicely but that was it.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re blonde, the quality of the chalks are very nice and the color options are wonderful</li>
      <li>This is a great set and certainly worth the 8.97</li>
      <li>But many of the colors do not work great on darker hair and you don’t get very much of any one color.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping , great item</li>
      <li>It was an okay product.</li>
      <li>Colored more of my fingers than my hair.</li>
      <li>I love to put color in my hair and did not want to dye it yet again</li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s why most people don&#x27;t like this product; they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it.</li>
      <li>daughters both love this kit in my pictures below in one of them</li>
      <li>Tore my hair apart more than anything.</li>
      <li>You have to keep applying and keep wetting the chalk to even it out and even then it doesn&#x27;t really look that great.</li>
      <li>These hair chalks are okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d avoid this item for sure.</li>
      <li>it is better application</li>
      <li>but I wanted to make sure they worked before giving them to them</li>
      <li>think this would be fun for kids who want funky streaks in their hair :)!</li>
      <li>But for my 4 year old toddler, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>they work best when wet</li>
      <li>Didnt go on hair easy.  </li>
      <li>Works well and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Wash out easy.  </li>
      <li>Washes out easily as well.</li>
      <li>I bought 2 packs, one was fine</li>
      <li>but once it is washed out, hair is fine.</li>
      <li>It made huge tangles and you can not use a hair brush and expect the color to stay in.</li>
      <li>ok don&#x27;t think they r worth $10</li>
      <li>But is you have light thinner hair</li>
      <li>but if you use hair spray with it i&#x27;m sure it would have worked better, what this product is, is chalk straight up chalk for a chalk board.</li>
      <li>The colors are actually very pretty so far, ive used 4 and have loved all of them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used hair chalks before, but these are so much fun!</li>
      <li>Ideally, you shouldn&#x27;t use water because you run the risk of staining our hair (but some blonde hair doesn&#x27;t absorb color well, so it does really depend on knowing your hair).</li>
      <li>Thanks:)</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work good on brown hair, don&#x27;t get this unless you&#x27;re blonde.</li>
      <li>The color easily comes off onto everything within the first day of use.</li>
      <li>the colors would be bold, however, with brown hair</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t work super well, and</li>
      <li>The pieces are small, yes, but very pigmented: perfect for accent pieces of color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and that really worked so much better and showed up very vibrant.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>I use on my puppy and have fun decorating her.  </li>
      <li>easy to use and the colors are vibrant.</li>
      <li>this could be really fun.</li>
      <li>There are so many other products out there that do a better job.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s going for right now.</li>
      <li>Although I received a nice value in cost these chalk sticks were extremely messy, broke easily and were not as washable as stated.</li>
      <li>She loves having colorful hair some-days when we are just staying home ;)</li>
      <li>the little girls loved them.  </li>
      <li>A Christmas present for my Grand daughter.</li>
      <li>This is my first experience using the chalk and I am leaving this product review before I have washed my hair after using it</li>
      <li>Go for chalks that are larger with a better grip.  </li>
      <li>I actually really like this hair chalk!</li>
      <li>love how you get 32 different colors to choose from so</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>but it showed up at first but by the end of the day it was gone.</li>
      <li>My first time using chalk, will never use it again.</li>
      <li>However, the colors do show really well if you&#x27;ve managed to use it right.</li>
      <li>I do like the colors very much and the prize is  reasonable for the amount you get.</li>
      <li>The chalk washes off easily and can be mixed easily as well, allowing for an easy to mess with make up set.</li>
      <li>This set works as good as any other hair chalk I&#x27;ve used, and the colors are a lot more vibrant than other chalk I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
      <li>Enjoying this....does dry out the hair when it is on</li>
      <li>It barely showed up in her light colored hair and when it did, it was gone really fast.</li>
      <li>Very high quality hair chalks to mix it up, and add a pop of clothing collaboration.</li>
      <li>This is a very misleading product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>and you can see she has much darker hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These were terrible!  Some were broken in the box when they arrived which meant they were totally unusable. They&#x27;re very small so when they break, there&#x27;s not enough left to rub them into your hair without them just crumbling.  Go for chalks that are larger with a better grip.  If you have long hair, using these tiny ones is a nightmare.</li>
    <li> hard to apply to the hair and it&#x27;s not as bright as the colors in the pictures</li>
    <li> Did not show up on dark hair</li>
    <li> Works well but keep in mind that they are semi permanent and some colors won&#x27;t wash out immediately (the pinks stayed in my hair for a long time) they do fade with every washing. They break easily so be careful. I bought 2 packs, one was fine but the other had 2 chalks smashed it it and the covered everything:(</li>
    <li> Colored more of my fingers than my hair. Complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> So worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon. I wouldn&#x27;t even rated this as one star but I had to do at least one. 👎🏼</li>
    <li> it will transfer to just about anything that the hair comes in contact with.</li>
    <li> Horrible product!!!  Was out of hair by morning!</li>
    <li> The pieces were all jumbled up and broken</li>
    <li> These hair chalks are okay. I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could. They are kind-of messy and small and hard to put on. They do last quite awhile, though, if you really layer the color on. For the price, they are good. There are so many other products out there that do a better job.</li>
    <li> They are a fun way to create a short term new look.  But many of the colors do not work great on darker hair and you don’t get very much of any one color.  So for me who can only use about a fourth of the colors this was not really that fun.  Also I if you have thick hair this could take some time.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that one it was one the colors did not seem to bleed, which is nice.  But the colors will fade at different rates.  Which means if you are trying to blend colors only expect the look to stay in place for 12 hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;Over all this was not a good product for me.  But is you have light thinner hair this could be really fun.</li>
    <li> u must get them wet and they are tiny sticks don&#x27;t know how long they would last they are ok don&#x27;t think they r worth $10</li>
    <li> nothing was broken. but, the chalks did not show up at all on my hair. very disappointed because they do not work .. there is way more chalk on my hands than my hair but the chalk hardly shows up on my pale skin either!! not worth it save your money.</li>
    <li> Works okay on light hair not good at all on dark hair</li>
    <li> Does not work on dry hair.. even though it claims to. Extremely messy and does not wash off hands or clothing easily.</li>
    <li> The chalk arrived broken and dusty. Used on my daughters hair and it didn&#x27;t even last the day.  Her hair is darker then the model but it showed up at first but by the end of the day it was gone.</li>
    <li> I love to put color in my hair and did not want to dye it yet again so I thought I would try something different. This worked great for me. It would not go on my hair dry thou. So i had to wet my hair and put it on then blow dry it. The colors are really bright in my hair which I love. I definitely would recommend to someone.</li>
    <li> Daughter gave as a birthday gift to one of her friends.  She loves them.</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to use. Washes out easily as well.</li>
    <li> I advise you not to buy this hair chalk. It was incredibly small, and does not work or transfer color into your hair in any way whatsoever. I wish I could give this 0 stars.</li>
    <li> Despite doing all the instructions perfectly it doesn&#x27;t apply well at all. The color barely shows up on my daughter&#x27;s blonde hair.  The color easily comes off onto everything within the first day of use. Would not recommend purchasing even at the low price.</li>
    <li> Small chalks and NOT bright at all. I have platinum blond hair. This one is also drying my hair a lot more than other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It is incredibly hard to get into your hair wow</li>
    <li> DAUGHTER LOVES this! Very high quality hair chalks to mix it up, and add a pop of clothing collaboration. It&#x27;s really great, at a very good price. Will purchase from this seller again, when we run out. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This looked good when I was done, but there were a couple of things that I didn&#x27;t like. It was difficult to apply dry and made my hair very knotty. When I brushed my hair after applying it, it distributed the color all over and didn&#x27;t stay in the steaks as I had applied it. It worked better and seemed to apply quicker and easier when the chalk was wet, however it still made my hair knotty. I also used one whole stick for one application of about 8 streaks through my long hair.</li>
    <li> When they said it was 3 inches i thought 2 inches.. but they are 2-3 cm&lt;br /&gt;they are really small but they work find and last alot so it&#x27;s okay! i had prime so it shiped on one day!</li>
    <li> The product is semi-difficult to use on hair, requiring a fair bit of skill and patience. However, the colors do show really well if you&#x27;ve managed to use it right. This chalk also makes for a great face makeup substitute. The chalk washes off easily and can be mixed easily as well, allowing for an easy to mess with make up set. (I made it look like I&#x27;d been roughed in a fight)</li>
    <li> My 5 yr old daughter had used hair chalk at a friends and wanted to buy some for herself.  We decided on this set and she&#x27;s been very happy.  She does it with wet hair and presses hard, and the color comes out bright on her brown hair and stays in for days.</li>
    <li> This chalk is not just for teens or young adults.  I use on my puppy and have fun decorating her.  Everyone who sees my pup has loved.  Wash out easy.  Great product</li>
    <li> Alright. So I think I have learned a lot from my experience with this hair chalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main lesson learned is that, depending on your hair type, you WILL get different results: If you have darker hair, you should wet your hair and the chalk and it should show up, but blonde hair is different. Ideally, you shouldn&#x27;t use water because you run the risk of staining our hair (but some blonde hair doesn&#x27;t absorb color well, so it does really depend on knowing your hair). My hair always absorbs color, so I tried to do it dry and it didn&#x27;t work super well, and it still ended up staining my hair the lavender color of the chalk (but it came out in two washes, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I used half a stick of lavender on just one streak of hair by my face because I have so much hair, so this product is ideal for shorter hair and thin streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I would recommend wearing gloves because it gets all over your hands (especially if you are wetting your hair or chalk). Plus, I would do this over a sink because the chalk will fall around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be fun for kids who want funky streaks in their hair :)! I think I&#x27;ll use this when I babysit, just probably not for myself due to my hair not being super compatible with their temporary coloring product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful!</li>
    <li> they work best when wet but they break really easily and are very small. The chalk worked the best on my daughters hair that was lighter not my daughter with brown hair.</li>
    <li> easy to use and the colors are vibrant. It is best to wet the chalk to get the best effect. This is my first experience using the chalk and I am leaving this product review before I have washed my hair after using it so I&#x27;m hoping it will stay at least a couple of days after washing. I do like the colors very much and the prize is  reasonable for the amount you get. the pieces are small but they get the job done</li>
    <li> I really like this little pack of chalk. The pieces are small, yes, but very pigmented: perfect for accent pieces of color.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium brown colored hair and all of the colors show up nicely. The lighter ones tend to get lost easier, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone who keeps their hair sleek, because adding the chalky powder does give your hair quite a bit of texture. I tend to either wear my hair up, or in a scrunchy, messier style, so I don&#x27;t mind it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Another tip would be to apply to damp hair, and I also wet the chalk a bit too. I noticed it doesn&#x27;t do a thing if your hair is dry. Be careful not to mess with your hair too much after you&#x27;ve applied it, because there will be plenty of fall-out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a fun product to spice up your regular hair color a bit, without the commitment. I actually think I might go for something a little more semi-permantent next, because I really dig the way the blue looks in my brown hair. :)</li>
    <li> DRIES HAIR OUT -- nothing but frizzy hair after using this. My first time using chalk, will never use it again.</li>
    <li> brightness of the color came out within less than an hour. Took longer to do than what it lasted 👎</li>
    <li> It was an okay product. When it arrived there were several broken pieces. Was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Item as described! Fast shipping! Thanks:)</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have medium brown hair.  We had previously used Hot Huez but she was complaining that the squeeze and slide method of application was too painful.  I bought these as they didn&#x27;t require the squeeze and slide.  You have to put a hard piece of plastic or under your hair to push against as you apply and then drag the chalk piece (approx. 1.5&amp;#34; long) down the hair.  However the color on these is very difficult to apply heavy enough to be seen.  Perhaps if our hair was bleached or white blond the colors would be bold, however, with brown hair these seemed to be a waste.</li>
    <li> Color does not work. Not on wet hair, not dry hair, and only worked on paper! Do not recommend at all!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work wet or dry...Doesn&#x27;t come with excellent primary colors...junk</li>
    <li> tons of colors I&#x27;ll never use them all!!</li>
    <li> These arrived smashed into pieces.&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t find that the color was easily&lt;br /&gt;Seen on the hair.</li>
    <li> Royie Temporary Hair Chalk Set&lt;br /&gt;I love how you get 32 different colors to choose from so you could just do part of your hair or all of your hair if you wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Now I seen some other reviews that stated this didn&#x27;t work but if you read the instructions it really does work no matter what color hair you have, also as it recommends put something behind the hair when you are coloring it because if not you will get it all over your hands.&lt;br /&gt;My daughters both love this kit in my pictures below in one of them I tried it on my daughter with it being dry and her hair being dry and it showed up great but remember you need to color on something to make sure you break the seal.&lt;br /&gt;The other picture is of my older daughter and you can see she has much darker hair I got a strip of her hair wet then got the chalk wet and that really worked so much better and showed up very vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> The chalk definitely isn&#x27;t semi permanent.  It is gone by the next morning, even if it wasn&#x27;t washed out of the hair.  It&#x27;s also a messy project and takes forever to get off of skin if it drips onto the forehead.  But for my 4 year old toddler, it&#x27;s great.  She loves having colorful hair some-days when we are just staying home ;)</li>
    <li> the little girls loved them.  but they are too small and dull hair to a fault.</li>
    <li> So these don&#x27;t work at all dry, which is what I wanted, and even when wet they are hard to apply and come off on my fingers more than my hair and it is completely uneven. You have to keep applying and keep wetting the chalk to even it out and even then it doesn&#x27;t really look that great.</li>
    <li> Product works great but when I got the package some of the chalks were broken and out of place I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to darker hair I tried it and didn&#x27;t show up well</li>
    <li> I got these for my sister who is 8. She hasn&#x27;t gotten them yet but I wanted to make sure they worked before giving them to them, I used the pink with dry hair and chalk and it went on so easy. I think it would stay longer if it&#x27;s wet and u dry it with something hot. The color was really noticeable in my bleached yellow hair. Would defently buy this again!</li>
    <li> Worked great ,didnot comb out and did not flake. Had a great time with it!</li>
    <li> A++++ Seller! Super fast shipping! Product smaller than anticipated but worked pretty well!</li>
    <li> a few pieces came broken, but still usable, good colors, YOU HAVE TO USE IT WHEN THE CHALK IS WET!, SO MUCH BETTER, a bit messy but the color is better and then just dry your hair with a dryer after applying the color and style as desired. the pieces are small but its only $10. you can use each color several times.</li>
    <li> Was impressed with the number of colors but not so much with the size of the sticks.</li>
    <li> My box makes it obvious that the manufacturer just grabbed a couple handfuls of chalk and tossed them in. I have no light pinks and five of the same yellow chalk which does not do well in blonde hair. There are also no light blue colors and at least 6 colors that look like dark brown colors. They&#x27;re all used and banged up. Maybe 1/3 of them are useable. This is not worth the $8 I payed for it. This is a very misleading product.&lt;br /&gt;This photo was taken immediately after I opened it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work good on brown hair, don&#x27;t get this unless you&#x27;re blonde. If you&#x27;re blonde, the quality of the chalks are very nice and the color options are wonderful</li>
    <li> The didnt work as I expected them also the colors looked so old!!!!</li>
    <li> Just OK not awesome even my girl&#x27;s light hair</li>
    <li> The colors that come with it are great but I found it very hard to get it onto my hair I thought it might be easier to rub on :(</li>
    <li> I got this for my 11-year old daughter.  I didn&#x27;t want her to use hair dye so I tried this.  Nice color assortment, product arrived in a timely fashion and was well-packed.  These chalks are really difficult to use, though.  The blues showed up nicely but that was it.  You have to hold your hair against a hard background, like a book, and rake the chalk over your hair up against that hard backing.  It sounds easy enough but the chalk never really stuck.  It was worth a shot.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m the only 5 star so far, and I was nervous to order these because of the low reviews. However, I think the other reviewers must want $100 worth for $9! You are getting 32 colors in a stated box size of 1&amp;#34; deep by 4&amp;#34; tall and 9.5&amp;#34; long. Doing basic math will tell you that these chalk pieces will only be approximately 1/2&amp;#34; square by approximately 1-1/2&amp;#34; long. I paid 4.99 in the store for 1 chalk ball with just 1 color! This set works as good as any other hair chalk I&#x27;ve used, and the colors are a lot more vibrant than other chalk I&#x27;ve gotten. Plus, you get 32 different colors to try for only $9.00! I honestly do not understand how anyone could give this a bad review unless they&#x27;ve never actually used hair chalk before, and weren&#x27;t really sure what they were getting into. Some reviews complained bout the pieces being broken, but I don&#x27;t see how they could be, as the chalk sits in individual slots in the tray with a layer of foam on top, and then the lid. Then the entire box is slid into a sleeve. This is a great set and certainly worth the 8.97 it&#x27;s going for right now. See photo attached.</li>
    <li> This works really well in my platinum hair as well as my daughters dark golden blonde hair. The pink colors last longer than the others (5-6 shampoos) while most wash out in 2-3 shampoos.</li>
    <li> Didnt go on hair easy.  Broke into pieces</li>
    <li> I actually really like this hair chalk! It&#x27;s great. At first when I opened it one or two pieces were out of place but nothing was broken. You need to wet your hair and then put the dry (or wet) chalk on your hair. This is what I figured out. I guess that&#x27;s why most people don&#x27;t like this product; they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it. It gives you bright, vibrant colors that are great for any time, I don&#x27;t know how you could hate it!</li>
    <li> i bought this expecting something completely different my expectations were to high, there were a lot of broken one in my package, but on my brown hair a lot of the colors showed, they didn&#x27;t last more then a hour, I&#x27;ve tried straighten my hair after using the product which helped the color stay but not long and my hair was so nasty i couldn&#x27;t take it. but if you use hair spray with it i&#x27;m sure it would have worked better, what this product is, is chalk straight up chalk for a chalk board. It works to a point but never like the pictures. it was disappointing but just gave it to my little nieces to play with. be prepared because the color you use will be on everything your hands clothes. it didn&#x27;t stain anything but just annoying.</li>
    <li> Does not work on hair.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this. The colors are brilliant, and it washes out easily.</li>
    <li> Its Not the best product. I used it and it did not show up until i got the chalk wet and then it showed up, then it came out and my hair was sticky and dry. It made huge tangles and you can not use a hair brush and expect the color to stay in. I recommend getting a commercial brand.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to put up as a gift for my daughter. Upon arrival the package was open without any plastic wrap around it or anything, &amp; the chalks were scattered all inside the box which caused damage to them. The size of these chalks were ridiculously tiny, each about 2 inches or smaller in length. My package is white &amp; says Royie Hair Chalk Blendable HairColorstix Patent Pending. I was imagining something a bit more comparable to the other set I ordered for my girls which were much larger &amp; easier to hold on than these. I can not imagine being able to apply these easily as it would be difficult to not break them while applying pressure to get enough of the color on your hair.</li>
    <li> It came with all the chalk broken and not in place. And was very hard to use. I&#x27;d avoid this item for sure.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with the size and or quality of this. I ended up giving them to my 4 year old to play with.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give this a ZERO. Tore my hair apart more than anything.</li>
    <li> Was looking for purple specifically.. purple not an option... messy and too hard to get any true color. I am a blonde like the girl in the photo description and it would take an hour to get color that vibrant.. I rubbed the chalk in my hair on a hard surface like it says and I got only a slight color with super sonic static charge to my new found lightly colored frizzy hair, but if you try and heat set it, the color gets dark and burnt looking.... I tried it wet and NOTHING I think you would almost have to paste it into to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping also to not feel the color or have a different texture post chalk... NO such luck... NOT A FAN would not purchase this again at all... SAD FACE REVIEW...</li>
    <li> Although I received a nice value in cost these chalk sticks were extremely messy, broke easily and were not as washable as stated. I was disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well. It barely showed up in her light colored hair and when it did, it was gone really fast. Looks like I got a box of tiny sidewalk chalk.</li>
    <li> Enjoying this....does dry out the hair when it is on but once it is washed out, hair is fine.</li>
    <li> It sucks and doesn&#x27;t work!!</li>
    <li> Not sure about function but this was a gift for my niece and she says I&#x27;m the best Aunt ever so I think its a winner!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work as expected!! And chalk makes hair extremely course and impossible to brush through!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping , great item</li>
    <li> A Christmas present for my Grand daughter. She loved it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used hair chalks before, but these are so much fun! They did arrive in kind of a disarray, but none were broken. If you put them in while your hair is wet it is better application then just putting them in on dry hair with wet chalk. The colors are actually very pretty so far, ive used 4 and have loved all of them. I onyl docked 1 star because the packaging is still an issue and doesnt seem to have been dealt with yet. Otherwise, I love this and would suggest it!</li>
