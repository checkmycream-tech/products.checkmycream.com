    <li> Not very to use. Worked the first time. Then my granddaughter and I tried and it smeared.</li>
    <li> really poor quality. and when you try to return it almost charge same as product price</li>
    <li> I bought this machine to my sister, is easy to use and funny. cheep and good choose. First use don&#x27;t forget remove the sticker in the lamina model.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s flimsy and cheaply made.  It only is made to use the small plates that come with the machine. No other plates will even work. You can&#x27;t center the plates to do a decent printing job on a nail. I could never recommend this.</li>
    <li> Brought this as a gift for my 9 year old.  Extremely frustrating to use.  Not worth it.  Their are easier products</li>
    <li> It was not for myself, they both were gifts an from what I was told there was no complaints.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my friend and she texted me of amazing this product.. you can watch youtube for tutorials of how to use it..i&#x27;m glad she liked it</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter loves this nail tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to use and creates great looking nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only limit is your imagination.</li>
    <li> I tried it did not work and it hurt to use I don&#x27;t like it dosent work don&#x27;t buy this</li>
    <li> Do not buy doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> This product was not like the bad reviews described it. Every time I do my nails with it , I get a flood of complements. The only downside to it was that the middle design on every plate wasn&#x27;t usable and I don&#x27;t know what some of the mechanisms on the printer do.</li>
    <li> This one never worked. The nail poish will never stick properly in the stamp.&lt;br /&gt; Even if it sticks a bit after several tries, it will never stamp as described in the nail.&lt;br /&gt; Please do not buy this and waste your money.</li>
    <li> I got this for my granddaughter, she was very disappointed with it....it doesn&#x27;t work!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t buy it or you will waste your money.</li>
    <li> My lovely granddaughters thought this was great so I got it for them.  They tell me all the time how much they love it.</li>

    <li> It was horrible u should get the other one its kind pf like this item but way better its like a pen</li>

    <li> This is unique &amp;easy to use. My 8 yr old niece loved it. I would recommend this to other people.</li>
    <li> The prints don&#x27;t work!! The polish comes off in seconds and it&#x27;s not what we were expecting!! And the nail polish dries off too fast!</li>
    <li> I seriously was so excited to buy this &amp; receive it! I opened it with high expectations. It doesn&#x27;t work. The nail polish sucks. The odor of the nail polish is awful. The machine itself doesn&#x27;t even work. I&#x27;m selling mine at a garage sale for $5. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I was so Happy to get this item. It is a Chistmas gift for one of the grandkids. I contacted the seller and was told it would be up to the first of Jan. before it would arrive. It showed up weeks before it was due. That just made my day. I am rating a 4 and not a 5 as I have not opened this. I would order from here again. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The polish doesn&#x27;t stick to the stamper.  Please run far away from this product.  I was very disappointed as well as my 8 year old.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be fun for 9 year old grand daughter-but was complicted and expensive for what you get.  Seller was fabulous, item was not supposed to be delivered until January, but they got it to me the day before Christmas.  Stamper came out in blurrs..and not designs...difficult to use</li>
    <li> The volume of my bluetooth is too low and i cannot hear anything clearly when talking with some one else</li>

    <li> Stay far away! Bought for my 10 year old niece. Waste of money. Difficult to use - cheaply constructed and totally dissapointing</li>
    <li> does not work as promised smudges to much</li>
    <li> First sign of trouble was the poor quality packaging from someone&#x27;s hut in China. Pieces were poorly packed, cheap flimsy materials etc. the unit was hard to operate. Unfortunately I was stupid and bought 3 units at once for Christmas stocking stuffers! Straight to the landfill! :(.</li>
