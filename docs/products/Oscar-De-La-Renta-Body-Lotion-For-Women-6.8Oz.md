    <li> Oscar De La Renta for  Women Body Lotion 6.6oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this products for over 20 years and I love them, the scent is very mild and does not overpower.  Sometimes I have trouble finding them, I am glad I can get them through you.  I use it as my only body lotion, the product meets my expectations.
