      <li>I bought this in hopes it would make my hair look smooth and shiny.</li>

      <li>This Serum Spray is light, unnoticeable, and does the job in our 100 degree plus weather here in the desert.</li>
      <li>I have dry, curly, and frizzy hair and this product works great for me.</li>
      <li>Wanted something to make my hair have some shine for a special event.</li>
      <li>Which surprised me because almost everything from Garnier smells amazing.</li>
      <li>use a quick spray on your hands.  </li>
      <li>When I sprayed this, following the directions and only misting lightly, I promptly had incredibly greasy hair.</li>
      <li>I had a few fly away so gave myself a couple of quick squirts</li>
      <li>specially during these hot and humid days!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>I had just finished drying my freshly washed hair.</li>
      <li>Getting it directly sent to home is a plus, because you never remember when you are in the store that you need more.</li>
      <li>I used it right after I got out of the shower</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t apply it directly on your hair, it is better to do it first on your hands</li>
      <li>I very  lightly mist only the drier parts and then use my hands to distribute through the rest of my hair.</li>
      <li>Great for reducing frizz and using prior to doing flat iron.</li>
      <li>Hot rollers tend to increase the effect.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft, smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>I have only given this item 3 stars since the smell is so overwhelming.</li>
      <li>One application will last for more than one day if the hair is not washed.</li>
      <li>It is the first product that has helped my hair.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what was required without going shopping.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Really like it!</li>
      <li>It pretty much keeps my hair shiny and nice all day long.</li>
      <li>The thing is though, if you use more than one spray, it will also make your hair look instantly greasy.</li>
      <li>But first, I&#x27;m going to wash my hair.</li>
      <li>I am always buying hair products that promise to give me sleek, straight, frizz-free hair and this one actually comes closer than most I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I know it doesn&#x27;t get the best reviews, but as I said before, you must use very sparingly; a little goes a very long way!</li>
      <li>First time i used it i put too much on</li>
      <li>I will buy this product again.it is good for permed, relaxed, bleached, dyed and natural hair.it will keep you hair from drying out which means less hair loss.</li>
      <li>Even though I have fine hair, a teeny spritz of this adds back the conditioning to my hair which coloring has taken out.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t help too much with that.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t get too much.</li>
      <li>It is VERY oily.</li>
      <li>This product can be very heavy, leaving your hair looking greasy, but if you find the right amount for you, it actually does create a nice shine and reduces frizz pretty well.</li>
      <li>A whole bunch of very fine hair that falls to the middle of my back and is naturally curly/wavy.  </li>
      <li>I used to use it myself until I found a keratin product I like more (although it is more expensive).</li>
      <li>One quick spray over your hair, and it provides instant shine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new shine spray for years.  </li>
      <li>I ended up using the entirety of a brand new travel-sized baby powder</li>
      <li>I live in the midwest where it is always humid.</li>
      <li>If you have applied too much, brush out the hair with a clean hairbrush to remove a little.</li>
      <li>Try a tiny bit first to see how it works on your hair.</li>
      <li>This is very economical considering how long a $4 bottle will last.</li>
      <li>My hair is normal to slightly oily and pretty straight without straightening.  </li>
      <li>It makes hair soft &amp; adds shine.</li>
      <li>You will be surprised.</li>
      <li>The old one I used was discontinued.  </li>
      <li>makes your hair soft.</li>
      <li>But, even when I straighten my fine textured hair, a small amount keeps me from having frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tip is to make sure you spay it from arms length away and only a small amount.</li>
      <li>This is meant for coarse, thick hair, but if you use very sparingly it detangles and shines even fine hair, you just have to be careful not to use too much or your hair will look greasy.</li>
      <li>but if you want a natural shine I think by the time you add enough product to achieve that, you have already gone too far.</li>
      <li>however, the  scent gave me a major headache.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s tempting to keep it a secret:-)</li>
      <li>Will not drip down your face when it gets hot.</li>
      <li>and I tried it on my natural curls and on flat ironed hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks shiny, feels soft and the scent goes away after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair that I flat iron, which leaves it a bit dry.</li>

    <li> I bought this in hopes it would make my hair look smooth and shiny. First time i used it i put too much on and my hair looked and felt greasy. But i have come to perfect the use of this. Tip is to make sure you spay it from arms length away and only a small amount. Do this with each arm and you hair will look shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> I really do love this product. I used to use it myself until I found a keratin product I like more (although it is more expensive). However, we still use this product for my teenage daughter. She flat irons her hair constantly, so has split ends and without this it appears dull and lifeless. She sprays this on and it is sleek and shiny, just like it did for my hair. I definitely recommend this to anyone who has dry and/or frizzy hair or dull hair that needs an extra boost for shine.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Esp when you already have your hair done up and your like \\&quot;man i forgot to put frizz control in\\&quot; just spray A LITTLE and it does A LOT!!&lt;br /&gt;Its lighter too so you wont feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Plus makes your hair soft. Smells wonderful! LOVEEEEE THIS!</li>
    <li> This is a bit greasy looking but my hair is so unruly that it can actually use it.  I bought a couple of bottles because it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair shiny but that is about all. Does not hold or create the sleekness indicated. Similar to a spray gel without the holding capability. If you do not like oily hair, do not use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon and I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product is HORRIFIC. I must warn you all. It coats the hair with this thick, heavy, shiny greasy film. Weighs down the hair and looks disgusting. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> great product. works great for frizzy fly away hair.</li>
    <li> fantastic product!!!!!</li>
    <li> &#x27;re: Essie nail color pink diamond...It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for improving shine and reducing frizz. It gives hair a more youthful appearance and feel. You will be surprised. A little bit goes along way.  You will need to use much less than you would a typical hairspray. Try a tiny bit first to see how it works on your hair. Apply over a sink as any over-spray that gets on the floor will make it slippery. You can apply to damp or dry hair, before styling. Hot rollers tend to increase the effect. If you have applied too much, brush out the hair with a clean hairbrush to remove a little. One application will last for more than one day if the hair is not washed. This product works so well, it&#x27;s tempting to keep it a secret:-)</li>
    <li> Only a little dap and you have shine and frizzies are gone.</li>
    <li> I have this it is a great product.I brought this from a logal cvs.it was three for ten dollars.if people think it smells bad just spray a little in your hands rub them together then run it through your hair.as for it being too greasy, nobody says to douse you hair with it.common sense with using products with oil, you don&#x27;t need alot.a little goes a long way.I will buy this product again.it is good for permed, relaxed, bleached, dyed and natural hair.it will keep you hair from drying out which means less hair loss.</li>
    <li> I love that Garnier Fructis has come out with a Argan Oil hair spray, it works wonderfully and makes my hair very manageable and shiny. I have only given this item 3 stars since the smell is so overwhelming. I mean, I spray 10-12 inches away from my hair as directed, and have the bathroom fan going and the smell completely overwhelms the place. It gives me headaches, and makes me dizzy. I am sure if Garnier Fructis revamped this Argan Oil 5 in 1 spray, then it would be a hit. Otherwise, I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Makes hair LOOK greasy. I would suggest this spray on curly hair. Also, the smell isn&#x27;t so pleasant. Which surprised me because almost everything from Garnier smells amazing. It makes hair soft &amp; adds shine.</li>
    <li> Really like it! specially during these hot and humid days!&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t apply it directly on your hair, it is better to do it first on your hands</li>
    <li> I was visiting family and asked for hair spray or something to tame flyaways and was given this. I had just finished drying my freshly washed hair. When I sprayed this, following the directions and only misting lightly, I promptly had incredibly greasy hair. It looked like I hadn&#x27;t showered in days and as I hadn&#x27;t used conditioner, my hair didn&#x27;t have any added oil. I ended up using the entirety of a brand new travel-sized baby powder (I have blonde hair) to dry up the grease because I didn&#x27;t have time to start over. Very frustrating!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Makes my hair shiny and sleek just like it says&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I cant find it in the stores. all the places I have bought it no longer carry it. I was so glad to see it available because I love this product. my hair is frizzy and it tames it down and adds shine to it. my daughter likes to use it too. the liquid serums seem to look greasy and don&#x27;t last. this stuff goes on easily and spreads evenly.. I love it...</li>
    <li> I am always buying hair products that promise to give me sleek, straight, frizz-free hair and this one actually comes closer than most I&#x27;ve tried. I have thin, fine, damaged (highlighted and blow dry and straighten with iron everyday) humidity-prone hair that gets puffy and frizzy if the humidity is over 1%. This product can be very heavy, leaving your hair looking greasy, but if you find the right amount for you, it actually does create a nice shine and reduces frizz pretty well. Yes, it does weigh your hair down a bit, but I&#x27;d rather have that than frizzy, puffy, dry looking hair. I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving this product a try. It pretty much keeps my hair shiny and nice all day long.</li>
    <li> This serum spray is terrible!  The mist lingers in the air for a long time so you breathe it in.  It smells like chemicals.  Left my hair very greasy and dirty feeling and I tried it on my natural curls and on flat ironed hair.  Overall just do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> My hair is normal to slightly oily and pretty straight without straightening.  This product was a disaster on my hair.  I used it right after I got out of the shower and now it looks like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in 3 days.  It looks disgustingly greasy.  I would not recommend this to anyone except people with extremely dry curly hair.</li>
    <li> the product came on time, does what it says it  will  do, and is as light as they say it is.  however, the  scent gave me a major headache.  i had to throw it  out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months. It is the first product that has helped my hair. I don&#x27;t have too blow dry my hair anymore which has strengthened my hair.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this thru Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not for thin straight hair. It is VERY oily. The day I used it was awful. I had a few fly away so gave myself a couple of quick squirts and I had a gross oil slick in my hair. I had no time to wash it again as I was almost out the door going to work. Had to put my hair in a pony tail to make it look less oily. I could have used my spray olive oil from the kitchen to get about the same results.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and it works as promised. I do not have to flat iron  my hair anymore. And it leaves a slight shine that is not oily looking.</li>
    <li> I have dry, curly, and frizzy hair and this product works great for me. It makes my hair soft, smooth and shiny. This is the only serum that dosent leave my hair greasy, a little goes a long way so as long as you don&#x27;t use a ton it shouldn&#x27;t leave hair oily. I used to have to use several products and now I just spray a little on wet hair and go. It has the same fruity fragrance as other garnier products, not chemical at all in my opinion. For the price this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love Garnier products which is why I&#x27;m so bummed about this one.  When I think of this spray, the first thing that comes to mind is the horrible choking feeling it causes upon inhalation. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this spray but it&#x27;s got a serious chemical smell and even turning on the bathroom fan doesn&#x27;t help, I literally have to hold my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing is if you spray too little it doesn&#x27;t do anything but too much and your hair is greasy and wet looking.  If that&#x27;s the look you want then kudos but if you want a natural shine I think by the time you add enough product to achieve that, you have already gone too far.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this spray, and sprayed it directly on my hair, I felt very dirty and greasy.  I was very unhappy with it.  But, then I tried spaying it on my hands and applying it indirectly.  That works very well, and now I am very happy with it.  Especially on days I wear my hair curly!  But, even when I straighten my fine textured hair, a small amount keeps me from having frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use a quick spray on your hands.  This is very economical considering how long a $4 bottle will last.</li>
    <li> I have a weird texture hair.  A whole bunch of very fine hair that falls to the middle of my back and is naturally curly/wavy.  When I go out I like to straighten it, and I need a product that will add weight and shine (my hair is prone to frizz), it makes my hair look like an Asian girl&#x27;s hair.  Black, shiny and silky.  Perfect.  I just pray they don&#x27;t stop making it.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a new shine spray for years.  The old one I used was discontinued.  I have spent $25 on a shine spray that didn&#x27;t work as well as this one.</li>
    <li> Wanted something to make my hair have some shine for a special event. I&#x27;m very glad I tried it out well in advance of that event. My hair looks greasy and smells very strongly like that honey-butter stuff they give you at some restaurants. Really really strongly. I only did a *tiny* spray. I&#x27;m going to return the darn thing, and try to find something with better reviews. But first, I&#x27;m going to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> i was so glad that i found this in amazon....works great on my hair...</li>
    <li> It does tame flyaways for me. I usually get little hairs that stick up on top of my head after straightening my hair, and it does put them down. It does give your hair shine. One quick spray over your hair, and it provides instant shine. Resisting frizz is a meh...it&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s not fantastic at it, but I guess my hair would have been worse if I didn&#x27;t use it. When it comes to humidity, it lacks in that department. I live in the midwest where it is always humid. This didn&#x27;t help too much with that. The thing is though, if you use more than one spray, it will also make your hair look instantly greasy. You know, because everyone loves that &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t taken a shower in days&amp;#34; look. My mom does like it though. She is in her 70s, and her hair has become dry and brittle. This spray has helped bring some moisture back to her hair, and for some reason it doesn&#x27;t look as gray.</li>
    <li> Great for reducing frizz and using prior to doing flat iron. No longer in stores (pity)</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that I flat iron, which leaves it a bit dry. This is the only serum spray that works for me. I very  lightly mist only the drier parts and then use my hands to distribute through the rest of my hair. My hair looks shiny, feels soft and the scent goes away after it&#x27;s dry. I know it doesn&#x27;t get the best reviews, but as I said before, you must use very sparingly; a little goes a very long way!</li>
    <li> Horrible product - don&#x27;t buy this unless you like the &#x27;wet&#x27; look for your hair. Doesn&#x27;t do anything it claims to.</li>
    <li> Did Garnier discontinue the product? I have not been able to find the product in any retail store!!! So Sad. Loved the serum spray</li>
    <li> This Serum Spray is light, unnoticeable, and does the job in our 100 degree plus weather here in the desert. Will not drip down your face when it gets hot. Getting it directly sent to home is a plus, because you never remember when you are in the store that you need more. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> My favorite shine spray! I can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore. So glad Amazon sells them. Could not live without this product!</li>
    <li> I just got this product from cvs a couple of days ago because I saw a commercial on it, and i just straightened my hair tonight for school tomorrow and now i have to go take a shower. It not only made my hair disgusting and greasy, but it also ruined my style. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS TERRIBLE!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what was required without going shopping.</li>
    <li> Even though I have fine hair, a teeny spritz of this adds back the conditioning to my hair which coloring has taken out. This is meant for coarse, thick hair, but if you use very sparingly it detangles and shines even fine hair, you just have to be careful not to use too much or your hair will look greasy. You will need to experiment with it, I usually spray the underside of my hair and brush through so I don&#x27;t get too much. My last bottle lasted over a year. Bought this to make sure I would still be able to get since I don&#x27;t see it in the store anymore.</li>
