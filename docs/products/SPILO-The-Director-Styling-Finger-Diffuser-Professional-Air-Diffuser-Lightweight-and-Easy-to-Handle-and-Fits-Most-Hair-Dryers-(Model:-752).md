      <li>It is great and a decent price!</li>
      <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
      <li>It has fallen off once or twice while using but mostly because I bumped it with my hand.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re better off going to a brick and mortar store.</li>
      <li>love this diffuser.</li>
      <li>I love the design on the end where the air comes out.</li>
      <li>I have a regular sized Helen of Troy hair dryer and this diffuser fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>Love using this for my wash n gos.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I want so badly to love this, but the fact of the matter is that it won&#x27;t stay on either of my blow dryers.</li>
      <li>Very good generic fit.</li>
      <li>Simple to use, works great, and</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>This fit into my Conair 1875.</li>
      <li>Had to return this because it didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer</li>
      <li>The part of the diffuser that attaches to the dryer gradually gets wider so it will fit a variety of dryer nozzle widths.</li>
      <li>The opening of the diffuser where the barrel fits in will fit any hair dryer with a barrel diameter of  1 1/2&amp;#34; to 2 1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>This could be my own incorrect expectations, but when they say it diffuses it REALLY diffuses.</li>
      <li>It was a silicone one and collapsible but had nothing to adjust size, so didn&#x27;t fit either of my two hair dryers.</li>
      <li>I gave it a 2 just because it didn&#x27;t fit in my blower.</li>
      <li>Fits my Conair blow dryer perfectly, and does exactly what I need it to do, which is dry my wavy hair without frizz.  </li>
      <li>Not for a short nozzle dryer- it pops right off, but it&#x27;s a good bowl and finger design of medium depth.</li>
      <li>It fit well and was exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>This one however fit the roughly 2.5 inch nozzle of my Revlon dryer and the deep bowl shape is perfect for my curls.</li>
      <li>But my hairdryer didn&#x27;t have a diffuser available for purchase, and this works really well on my hair.  </li>
      <li>It would cost me $20 to UPS the package back to LA therefore, not cost effective to return it for the refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very useful and get an very curly hair.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t have the right blow drier.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.  </li>
      <li>Might work for dryers smaller than 2&amp;#34; but anything more and the diffuser will shoot off the end of the dryer when it&#x27;s turned on.</li>
      <li>Something as simple as a gripping rubber gasket might work.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s big since I have tons of hair.</li>
      <li>plastic that fits over the barrel does get hot</li>
      <li>This one is not very bulky and makes my hair nicely wavy.</li>
      <li>I love that the bowl is large and really deep.</li>
      <li>I love this little diffuser and the fantastic curls</li>
      <li>-make sure yours is long in the front.  </li>
      <li>and I diffuse it very often.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Knowing that most dryers these days are not perfectly straight cylinder shapes you&#x27;d think someone at this company would come up with a diffuser design that makes it stay on.</li>
      <li>Fits on the very skinny nozzle of my Deva Curl Dryer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it will fit on very large (wide width) dryer nozzles though.</li>
      <li>When it arrived it did indeed fit the small nozzle but the diffuser itself is huge and will not work with my dryer.  </li>
      <li>So, I got a new blow dryer and it&#x27;s no longer popping off!</li>
      <li>so I never use high heat and stick to medium or low with it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you bring it very close to your head the fingers and the shape of the cone allow you to dry your hair without blowing it all around, and without burning your head.</li>
      <li>I realize this is a bit silly, leaving a review for a diffuser -- but -- my curly hair has become so much better since I started using this!</li>
      <li>and once it&#x27;s on, it heats up very quickly, and usually shoots off if it&#x27;s angled any other direction that directly at the ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well made and clearly does what it says, but since it&#x27;s effectively useless to me three stars is the most I can do.</li>

<li> While I never use heat but only cool air, I&#x27;m afraid I do not know if this product is capable of melting.</li>
<li> I feel like I&#x27;m not getting enough heat in any one place to dry my hair, so I don&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
<li> There should be a way to find this out before actual purchase, but information on fit is a bit vague.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had problems with past diffusers, and it was probably because I used the High heat setting...</li>
<li> Description Is not complete.  </li>
<li> Beware if your dryer has a wide and/or short barrel.</li>
<li> Will not work for dryers with short wide barrels unless you remove the plastic prongs, rubber bands and springs.</li>

<li> /&gt;There have been some complaints of it slipping off</li>
<li> Not very convenient, but it works.  </li>
<li> Keeps popping off mine due to being a little too short</li>
<li> /&gt;But the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the design on the other end - the end where it attaches to your blow dryer.</li>
<li> You have to hold it on the dryer with one hand and the dryer with the other.  </li>
<li> This allows me to put almost a quarter of my hair into the diffuser at once cutting my drying time in half over my original diffuser, that came with my Conair dryer.</li>
<li> It fit my hair dryer, but slides off the dryer; impossible to make it stay on.</li>
<li> If your blow dryer is not a perfectly straight cylindrical shape this diffuser will pop off within a minute or less, even if you point it upward.</li>
<li> I have an Andis 1875 blow dryer which has an average barrel size.</li>
<li> The barrel of the dryer is slightly less than 2 inches in diameter.</li>
<li> Only thing is base gets really hot after 5 min.</li>
<li> Using other diffusers, that don&#x27;t have this design, usually results in frizz</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Might work for dryers smaller than 2&amp;#34; but anything more and the diffuser will shoot off the end of the dryer when it&#x27;s turned on. The design of the diffuser is fundamentally flawed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to push it on my 2&amp;#34; hair dryer and once it&#x27;s on, it heats up very quickly, and usually shoots off if it&#x27;s angled any other direction that directly at the ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the process of returning the diffuser and MetroHop has NOT provided paid postage to return the item before I get refunded. It would cost me $20 to UPS the package back to LA therefore, not cost effective to return it for the refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off going to a brick and mortar store.</li>
    <li> Initial barrel opening is 2 3/4\\&quot; and drastically narrows. Will not work for dryers with short wide barrels unless you remove the plastic prongs, rubber bands and springs. Then it will slide over your dryer and stay if you keep the dryer facing up.</li>
    <li> This could be my own incorrect expectations, but when they say it diffuses it REALLY diffuses. I feel like I&#x27;m not getting enough heat in any one place to dry my hair, so I don&#x27;t use it at all. It&#x27;s well made and clearly does what it says, but since it&#x27;s effectively useless to me three stars is the most I can do.</li>
    <li> Description Is not complete.  Product description says  &amp;#34;Attachment ONLY fits hair dryer nozzles approximately 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter.&amp;#34;  When I read this I thought the diffuser would be in proportion to the small nozzle.  I wanted this for my travel hair dryer.  When it arrived it did indeed fit the small nozzle but the diffuser itself is huge and will not work with my dryer.  I sent it back the same day.  I got it.</li>
    <li> It works great when it stays on.  I have a Conair 1875 shine ion.  It fits, but only stays for a minute if even that.  You have to hold it on the dryer with one hand and the dryer with the other.  Not very convenient, but it works.  I might end of taping it on permanently so I don&#x27;t have to deal with it coming off.</li>
    <li> Use a Conair 1875. Will not stay on. Just pops off.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly and worked well!!! Very happy</li>
    <li> Measurements- The opening of the diffuser where the barrel fits in will fit any hair dryer with a barrel diameter of  1 1/2&amp;#34; to 2 1/2&amp;#34;. The opening is 2 9/16&amp;#34; at it&#x27;s widest. There are fins that adjust and flex inside to grip the barrel of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this diffuser. It is perfect for curly hair. The well of the diffuser is 1 3/4&amp;#34; deep at the center and over 5 &amp;#34; wide. This allows me to put almost a quarter of my hair into the diffuser at once cutting my drying time in half over my original diffuser, that came with my Conair dryer. Because of the size it also allows me to position the diffuser fewer times which decreases frizz caused by disturbing and moving my curls frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic that fits over the barrel does get hot so I never use high heat and stick to medium or low with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been some complaints of it slipping off but I have not had that issue. You can&#x27;t hold the diffuser and expect the dryer to stay in it. You need to hold the dryer and the diffuser should stay on in all positions.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a blow dryer this would stay on without popping off. I went through about 5 different ones.</li>
    <li> Fits my hair dryer perfect, love it!</li>
    <li> I have a regular sized Helen of Troy hair dryer and this diffuser fits perfectly. There&#x27;s a good amount of teeth to grab hair and it works great, thank you</li>
    <li> Beware if your dryer has a wide and/or short barrel. Won&#x27;t fit. There should be a way to find this out before actual purchase, but information on fit is a bit vague.</li>
    <li> Of the two blow dryers that I own, this attachment fits neither.</li>
    <li> Works just add described!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased.  It fit well and was exactly what I needed.  Came on time and was perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> It did not fir my hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Only thing is base gets really hot after 5 min.</li>
    <li> Took a chance but this does not fit the Conair Folding Handle 1875-Watt Dryer / Model 124TL. The search continues! (And now I&#x27;m stuck with this since I just missed the return window!)</li>
    <li> I realize this is a bit silly, leaving a review for a diffuser -- but -- my curly hair has become so much better since I started using this! No frizz, just luscious fat curls. So, shallow as it may be, I adore this.</li>
    <li> Very useful and get an very curly hair. It was a good purchase</li>
    <li> Fits great on my dryer.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> I want so badly to love this, but the fact of the matter is that it won&#x27;t stay on either of my blow dryers. It works for what it was designed to do, but I can&#x27;t use it for longer than ten seconds before it&#x27;s popping off. Maybe I can find a dryer that will work at some point. If there is any change to the diameter of the barrel of your dryer then this thing will not stay fastened.  Update 06/25/15 So, I got a new blow dryer and it&#x27;s no longer popping off! I love this little diffuser and the fantastic curls it gives me in a fraction of the time compared to air drying my hair. I would recommend using a curling cream or similar product on your hair before drying to lessen any flyaways. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Fits my Conair perfectly, works really well.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I love that it&#x27;s big since I have tons of hair.</li>
    <li> Very good generic fit. Stays on my revive with not issues</li>
    <li> It fits my dryer.  It diffuses.</li>
    <li> Does the job perfectly and fitted my hairdryer with no issues.</li>
    <li> I love the design on the end where the air comes out. If you bring it very close to your head the fingers and the shape of the cone allow you to dry your hair without blowing it all around, and without burning your head. Using other diffusers, that don&#x27;t have this design, usually results in frizz (especially if you have curly hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the design on the other end - the end where it attaches to your blow dryer. If your blow dryer is not a perfectly straight cylindrical shape this diffuser will pop off within a minute or less, even if you point it upward. I&#x27;ve tried it on 4 different dryers, all had the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that most dryers these days are not perfectly straight cylinder shapes you&#x27;d think someone at this company would come up with a diffuser design that makes it stay on. Something as simple as a gripping rubber gasket might work. Maybe I should patent that idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for now I&#x27;m considering duck tape, or Velcro tape. It will look bad but it’s better than having it pop off every minute and having to go after it as it rolls around the floor.</li>
    <li> Yes, it will pop off.  Every once in a while.  But my hairdryer didn&#x27;t have a diffuser available for purchase, and this works really well on my hair.  Overall, it&#x27;s not that big a deal to put it back on maybe once a session.</li>
    <li> Love using this for my wash n gos.</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser. My thick hair is manageable with this diffuser. You will need a narrow snout blowdryer for this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have the right blow drier.</li>
    <li> I have a Turbo 3200 hairdryer and this diffuser fits perfectly. I bought one that was specifically for Turbo hairdryers (and double the price) and didn&#x27;t work as well as this one. This one is not very bulky and makes my hair nicely wavy. It has fallen off once or twice while using but mostly because I bumped it with my hand.</li>
    <li> Fits on the very skinny nozzle of my Deva Curl Dryer. Does a great job. The part of the diffuser that attaches to the dryer gradually gets wider so it will fit a variety of dryer nozzle widths. I don&#x27;t think it will fit on very large (wide width) dryer nozzles though. I love it.</li>
    <li> Does not fit all hairdryers-make sure yours is long in the front.  Keeps popping off mine due to being a little too short so I have to hold it on.  It works great this way but kind of a pain to hold on to it.</li>
    <li> It fit my hair dryer, but slides off the dryer; impossible to make it stay on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this diffuser after seeing it on a Utube video. It is great and a decent price! Love my curly hair now!</li>
    <li> Fits my T3 Micro. Model #53888 R. The barrel of the dryer is slightly less than 2 inches in diameter. Push in and twist, it will latch and stays on perfectly. This is a great value and works well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to go with my Rusk W8less Professional Hair Dryer and it fits perfectly! I love that the bowl is large and really deep. This is a must-have for curly hair!</li>
    <li> This fit into my Conair 1875. It works great!</li>
    <li> The diffuser works well...when it isn&#x27;t falling off my dryer. I just bought a Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Dryer, and the diffuser starts to pop off the hair dryer once the unit warms up. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for this hair dryer, but it might work well for others.</li>
    <li> Had to return this because it didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer</li>
    <li> Good size and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve had problems with past diffusers, and it was probably because I used the High heat setting...slowly melting the plastic. I&#x27;ve kept this one on the lower setting and it&#x27;s working well.</li>
    <li> This diffuser fits my hair dryer and works beautifully. No problems. The diffuser I abandoned would jump off the hair dryer. This one stays in place.</li>
    <li> Not for a short nozzle dryer- it pops right off, but it&#x27;s a good bowl and finger design of medium depth.</li>
    <li> I have an Andis 1875 blow dryer which has an average barrel size. This diffuser works perfectly.  On ocassion the diffuser will slip off but not often enough to affect the rating in my opinion. I like that this diffuser has long fingers which helps to grab my hair as I blow dry upwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently learning to style my hair deva style. While I never use heat but only cool air, I&#x27;m afraid I do not know if this product is capable of melting. Besides, if you are using a diffuser for curly hair, then you probably will not be using heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily after a shower and I do not have any complaints.  For the price,  i would purchase again if needed but it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.  I don&#x27;t forsee ever having to purchase another. If it fell to hit the floor I still don&#x27;t think it would break as the plastic is a softer type.</li>
    <li> Fits my Conair blow dryer perfectly, and does exactly what I need it to do, which is dry my wavy hair without frizz.  Simple to use, works great, and it was a good price!</li>
    <li> I gave it a 2 just because it didn&#x27;t fit in my blower.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a different diffuser. It was a silicone one and collapsible but had nothing to adjust size, so didn&#x27;t fit either of my two hair dryers. This one however fit the roughly 2.5 inch nozzle of my Revlon dryer and the deep bowl shape is perfect for my curls.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my blow dryer perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and I diffuse it very often. This is the only brand/model that I use. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve had the same one for over 10 years and just needed to replace it because I cracked it.</li>
