      <li>and my skin feels soooooo nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months now (May to August), and I would say it has been a very gradual change, but I am impressed with the results.  </li>
      <li>I have not noticed any kind of a difference in the darker areas.</li>
      <li>It has a nice finish too, not greasy at all.  </li>

      <li>It feels great, softens my skin, and overall, a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>When I bought this cream, I wasn&#x27;t so sure what exactly its claims are except its anti-aging nutrients, but i&#x27;m happy I did give it a try.    </li>
      <li>For the price, it beats most of them.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, but this does not work as stated (sun damage).  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Garnier works much better.</li>
      <li>I love this product and will always have this in my cosmetic drawer.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of coffee.</li>
      <li>It smells very sweet, almost too sweet, and feels kind of greasy.  </li>
      <li>Love the light scent</li>
      <li>I would probably continue to use it to see more significant results.</li>
      <li>It does go on easily....</li>
      <li>Again, this is a fine moisturizer</li>
      <li>Clear, bright and supple.</li>
      <li>The 100% Pure products are nice, they smooth onto the skin easily and each have a mild scent to them however</li>
      <li>It really does smell like sweet cherry coffee--just delicious--and of course, 100% pure makes great products.</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this cream.  </li>
      <li>and I need two full pumps for my face and neck.  </li>
      <li>Before my skin was super combination (T-zone oiliness and flakiness)</li>
      <li>Guess it is good for dry skin.</li>
      <li>After a minute it soaks in nicely and actually feels pretty light weight.  </li>
      <li>Ive only been using this for a week now, but i love this!</li>
      <li>Great for winterizing my skin because it&#x27;s a little denser than the reparative cream</li>
      <li>So far, my favorite face cream from 100%.  </li>
      <li>We love the idea of all natural, and organic....</li>
      <li>and I was sure I was going to have major breakouts.  </li>
      <li>Because of my outdoor activities, I have been using many different kinds of face cream to \\&quot;fade\\&quot; the sun spots and \\&quot;repair\\&quot; my \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; face.  </li>
      <li>This will be back in my regimen as soon as the weather changes :)</li>
      <li>I normally do not like most skincare lines, but when i use this at night i wake up</li>
      <li>Goes on easily and sinks right in.</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup and in all the photos I look young and fresh faced</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping this will hold up through the winter when my skin gets very</li>
      <li>Is it really healing and corrective?</li>
      <li>It took me awhile to get over the smell, and now I really like it (so does my husband).  </li>
      <li>However, I really wish that this company would stop making claims that their products don&#x27;t live up to.  </li>
      <li>It is pure, natural, nothing synthetic about it.  </li>
      <li>Most likely will order in the near future.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich and thick upon application, but blends in quickly and never leaves my skin feeling oily.  </li>
      <li>I can be sensitive to natural products but so far this one seems gentle.</li>
      <li>, I really think these products are meant for women in their 20/30&#x27;s as they were not effective on more mature skin (&amp;#62;40)</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive, acne prone, combination to dry skin.  </li>
      <li>The smell of this product is nice, not overwhelming and reminds me of white chocolate.</li>
      <li>I tried this with another new products that claim for tone correction, and this one works better than the other one, which is more expensive...  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is natural and comforting.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels and looks soft, no irritation.  </li>
      <li>But I do prefer natural, organic products.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re a young woman that wants/needs lighter results, these products are probably for you.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft, not tight, and I can see the sun spots diminishing.</li>
      <li>I have been using it every single night for over a month, my sun spots have noticeable reduction (they still are on my face but much much lighter than they used to be).  </li>
      <li>I actually like a lot of 100 Percent Pure&#x27;s products because of their natural ingredients and lack of chemicals other cosmetics contain.</li>
      <li>I have normal to sometimes dry skin.</li>
      <li>not cheap, but not expensive.....</li>
      <li>The product I was sent has aloe juice as the first ingredient and green and white tea</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with aloe, but I use it on my face everyday by itself and was looking forward to having this that used two things that aren&#x27;t easy to find in prepackaged bottles--white and green</li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts from this, my skin feels very moisturized, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this or a combination of all the new products I&#x27;ve been using (clarisonic, philosophy dark spot corrector, various BB creams)</li>

<li> tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in between another product that has Acai Berry as its first ingredient among other antioxidant rich ingredients (Acure Wrinkle Complex) and not aloe like everything else, so I am not sure if I am going to keep using this given the ingredient list problems that is even listed wrong on 100% Pure&#x27;s Website.</li>

<li> I love 100 Percent products, but this one is bad.  </li>
<li> Not sure if this is actually working.</li>
<li> are 12 ingredients down the list!</li>
<li> I use this at night because it feels too heavy for day time.</li>
<li> and I could NEVER touch my face throughout the day without the risk of an oil slick.</li>
<li> i think that&#x27;s because the ingredients working really hard to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; the damage from the sun.  </li>
<li> I always double check the list because Amazon has problems keeping things correct, and this time even the manufacturer&#x27;s website is wrong!</li>
<li> The only bad thing I can say about this product is that I cannot tell when it is running out.</li>
<li> It feels very thick</li>

    <li> I tried this with another new products that claim for tone correction, and this one works better than the other one, which is more expensive...  When I bought this cream, I wasn&#x27;t so sure what exactly its claims are except its anti-aging nutrients, but i&#x27;m happy I did give it a try.    I have been using it every single night for over a month, my sun spots have noticeable reduction (they still are on my face but much much lighter than they used to be).  I do outdoor water sports 3 to 4 days a week, and I have exposed to the sun for at last 2 to 4 hours per session. I notice that my face will be \\&quot;heating\\&quot; up if using it after exposing to the sun, the \\&quot;heat\\&quot; isn&#x27;t like irritated inflammation, i don&#x27;t feel any hurt at all but just \\&quot;heat\\&quot; and look red for awhile (longer I exposed to the sun, longer the \\&quot;heat\\&quot; last for; in other words, if i don&#x27;t do any outdoor sport that day, my face won&#x27;t \\&quot;heat\\&quot; up.) i think that&#x27;s because the ingredients working really hard to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; the damage from the sun.  (my another tone-corrective cream that I bought at the same time doesn&#x27;t have such \\&quot;effect\\&quot;)  Because of my outdoor activities, I have been using many different kinds of face cream to \\&quot;fade\\&quot; the sun spots and \\&quot;repair\\&quot; my \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; face.  This is one of the best face creams I have been using so far.  For the price, it beats most of them.</li>
    <li> I would probably continue to use it to see more significant results. Most likely will order in the near future.</li>
    <li> Ive only been using this for a week now, but i love this! I normally do not like most skincare lines, but when i use this at night i wake up and my skin feels soooooo nice. I have normal to sometimes dry skin. Smells like chocolate, and its Vegan! Yay for that! I can be sensitive to natural products but so far this one seems gentle.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I wear it every day under makeup, by itself; I reapply it during the day when I can..why? Because of the SMELL!! It really does smell like sweet cherry coffee--just delicious--and of course, 100% pure makes great products. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer as well!!</li>
    <li> This is my second order and I think I will use this for a long time.  It does seem to be lightening/brightening my skin.  Even if it didn&#x27;t, I would still use it as a moisturizer.  It also lasts longer than I thought it would.  Love the light scent - I find it soothing.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I am just amazed at the overall results. Before my skin was super combination (T-zone oiliness and flakiness) and I could NEVER touch my face throughout the day without the risk of an oil slick. You know that complexion you have when you&#x27;re just so elated about an upcoming event, date etc? That&#x27;s how I would describe my face now. Clear, bright and supple. I did switch up my facial cleansing routine, as well, to an all natural facial bar cleanser that I previously reviewed. The smell of this product is nice, not overwhelming and reminds me of white chocolate. The only bad thing I can say about this product is that I cannot tell when it is running out.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will always have this in my cosmetic drawer.  It is pure, natural, nothing synthetic about it.  The fragrance is natural and comforting.  My skin feels and looks soft, no irritation.  Goes on easily and sinks right in. Give this a try like I did.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is actually working. I have not noticed any kind of a difference in the darker areas. Garnier works much better. But I do prefer natural, organic products.</li>
    <li> So far, my favorite face cream from 100%.  And it smells delicious!  Great for winterizing my skin because it&#x27;s a little denser than the reparative cream I used this summer.  I also see a difference in how my skin looks and feels. It&#x27;s soft, not tight, and I can see the sun spots diminishing.</li>
    <li> We love the idea of all natural, and organic....it smells good and goes on well. Is it really healing and corrective? It does go on easily....not cheap, but not expensive.....so we give it an 80 out of 100....if we knew it was corrective it would get a 100....but at what point do you decide this?</li>
    <li> The 100% Pure products are nice, they smooth onto the skin easily and each have a mild scent to them however, I really think these products are meant for women in their 20/30&#x27;s as they were not effective on more mature skin (&amp;#62;40) and I have really good skin to begin with - good genes I guess. So if you&#x27;re a young woman that wants/needs lighter results, these products are probably for you.</li>
    <li> Not everyone likes the aroma, but i do.  It&#x27;s rich and thick upon application, but blends in quickly and never leaves my skin feeling oily.  I think it has helped to even the tone.</li>
    <li> I love 100 Percent products, but this one is bad.  It has broke my face out with a rash.  I love the smell, but this does not work as stated (sun damage).  This product I will not buy again nor recomend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The natural ingredients are awesome! It feels great, softens my skin, and overall, a great moisturizer. I use this at night because it feels too heavy for day time. I use a tinted moisturizer with spf during the day and that is all I need.  with that being said, why only 3 stars? I&#x27;ve used this for about a year, and I can honestly tell say that it does nothing to correct any sun damage. I actually like a lot of 100 Percent Pure&#x27;s products because of their natural ingredients and lack of chemicals other cosmetics contain. However, I really wish that this company would stop making claims that their products don&#x27;t live up to.  Again, this is a fine moisturizer and I would have given it 4 or even 5 stars if there was no claim about correcting sun damage.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the ingredients, but had to throw it out. I did not like the smell and it did not lessen the entire day.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin and smells good too - a winning combination. I love the smell of coffee. Don&#x27;t know what it does for me but my skin absorbs it immediately. Guess it is good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the main ingredients were listed as green and white tea. The product I was sent has aloe juice as the first ingredient and green and white tea are 12 ingredients down the list! I don&#x27;t have a problem with aloe, but I use it on my face everyday by itself and was looking forward to having this that used two things that aren&#x27;t easy to find in prepackaged bottles--white and green tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in between another product that has Acai Berry as its first ingredient among other antioxidant rich ingredients (Acure Wrinkle Complex) and not aloe like everything else, so I am not sure if I am going to keep using this given the ingredient list problems that is even listed wrong on 100% Pure&#x27;s Website. I always double check the list because Amazon has problems keeping things correct, and this time even the manufacturer&#x27;s website is wrong!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it is really repairing sun damage yet but it makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used almost the entire bottle and haven&#x27;t noticed any sun damage correction.  Good moisturizer but, that&#x27;s about it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this cream.  I use it only at night because of the lack of sunscreen.  It feels very thick and I need two full pumps for my face and neck.  It smells very sweet, almost too sweet, and feels kind of greasy.  It felt like I was rubbing frosting on my face and I was sure I was going to have major breakouts.  After a minute it soaks in nicely and actually feels pretty light weight.  It has a nice finish too, not greasy at all.  It took me awhile to get over the smell, and now I really like it (so does my husband).  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts from this, my skin feels very moisturized, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this or a combination of all the new products I&#x27;ve been using (clarisonic, philosophy dark spot corrector, various BB creams) but my skin has been looking great!  My son just had a pool party so I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup and in all the photos I look young and fresh faced, I was amazed!  I was sure it was the super nice camera my father in law was using, but then my mom commented on how great my skin was looking.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months now (May to August), and I would say it has been a very gradual change, but I am impressed with the results.  I have super sensitive, acne prone, combination to dry skin.  I&#x27;m hoping this will hold up through the winter when my skin gets very dry.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Now that it is winter this isn&#x27;t quite enough.  I bumped it up to 3 pumps, but eventually switched to a heavier cream.  This will be back in my regimen as soon as the weather changes :)</li>
