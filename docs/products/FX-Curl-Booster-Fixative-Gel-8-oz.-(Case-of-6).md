      <li>figured since a great curling gel was once so easy to stumble upon, most any curling gel could do.</li>
      <li>This product gives good hold to naturally wavy/curly hair.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t use it much on wet hair but the times I have done that I have been happy with the way it shaped my curls.  </li>
      <li>however it&#x27;s different than it used to be (not as good)</li>
      <li>Aveda Be Curly Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, Samy Fat Hair Creme Thickening Creme, FX Curl Booster Fixative gel and Sexy Hair Big Sexy Spray.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product for anyone looking for their favorite curling gel.</li>

      <li>I used this in the past when you could buy it in stores and was really upset when they discontinued selling it, I was really happy when I found it online</li>
      <li>I still use a defrizzant first.</li>
      <li>I went home and used the gel then went straight back to the store and bought two or four more.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this at any of our local stores here in Connecticut now, for some reason, but I am thankful it is available on-line.</li>
      <li>Thanks Fx....</li>
      <li>I just went through a whole list of them:</li>
      <li>Also works great to blow out the curls for a straight look that will last for a few days!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product and buy it on Amazon six bottles at a time because I cannot find it anymore at the local drugstore I regularly shop at.  </li>
      <li>and I have to use a little more than before to make my curls spring and not frizz.</li>
      <li>gel, aside from Graham Webb&#x27;s Curl Defining Gel (which has been discontinued :((), has done the best things for my hair.</li>
      <li>bought this based on the reviews, and all I can say is Wow!  </li>
      <li>It is perfect for scrunching into dry OR wet hair, banishes frizz (from dry hair), and gives hair a slightly heavier weight where you feel like it is actually going to hold all day.  </li>
      <li>The curls are well-defined and soft and natural.  </li>
      <li>The curls are well-defined and soft and natural.  </li>
      <li>Defines and separates , soft with out frizz and not sticky.</li>
      <li>The company changed the bottle packaging and the ones I bought and received are the old.</li>
      <li>It gives me natural looking curls without any fuss or frizz.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty thrilling after years of limp frizzy</li>
      <li>leave the thick residue that most fixative gels leave.  </li>
      <li>My hair is low maintenance so long as I use the right</li>
      <li>This gel is thick and kind of sticky, so I water it down just a bit with a leave in conditioner spray, and my hair turns out bouncy and curly every time.  </li>
      <li>The Pantene left my hair looking kind of thin and wet, the confixor didn&#x27;t have much hold, and the Eco styler left my hair feeling crunchy and dried it out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The hold is not real stiff, so the curls look natural and the hair is less prone to breakage.</li>

    <li> The best hair product ever. Perfect for my curly hair. Defines and separates , soft with out frizz and not sticky. Also works great to blow out the curls for a straight look that will last for a few days!  I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t sell this product in the stores any more. Smarten up FX.  Maybe you just need better marketing!</li>
    <li> I found this gel at CVS, but now they don&#x27;t carry it anymore, and I HAD TO HAVE MORE!  This gel is thick and kind of sticky, so I water it down just a bit with a leave in conditioner spray, and my hair turns out bouncy and curly every time.  Best gel I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> When my local pharmacy stopped carrying this gel, I tried about 5 others, but they were all bad.  They made my hair look wet, greasy, or turned my curls hard and crispy.  Other gels caused flakes.  This gel is so great that I just put it in my wet hair and scrunch a bit and go about my day.  No blowdrying necessary.  It gives me natural looking curls without any fuss or frizz.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair gel. I have tried many others but they either add a sticky residue to my hair or don&#x27;t add any body at all. I can&#x27;t find this at any of our local stores here in Connecticut now, for some reason, but I am thankful it is available on-line. I hope FX continues to make it. I have been using it for several years and think it is the best product on the market!     I have baby-fine hair and would be lost without it!</li>
    <li> I think FX has altered this gel. It is definitely not as concentrated and \\&quot;long lasting\\&quot; as before and I have to use a little more than before to make my curls spring and not frizz. However, there is not another gel anywhere as effective as this one.  Will continue to buy it...</li>
    <li> Great for taming naturally curly hair without the stiffness.  Also a great price for this product.  I turned to Amazon when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. My local stores stopped carrying it so I had to buy online. The company changed the bottle packaging and the ones I bought and received are the old. For some reason the gel isn&#x27;t as strong so I&#x27;m not completely satisfied. I will  continue to buy this product anyway because I haven&#x27;t found another product that even comes close. Other than that one issue I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this product; it does GREAT things for my curly hair. People ask if I like my hair or not (because curly hair is often fussy) and I them that I&#x27;m like Sampson from the Bible: I derive power from my hair. My hair is low maintenance so long as I use the right products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around 2009, my go-to hair product was Graham Webb Curl Defining Gel. But one day, I couldn&#x27;t find it and FX Curl Booster Fixtative gel was on sale at Walgreens or CVS or Rite Aid. Something crazy like 2 for $5. So I bought two. I went home and used the gel then went straight back to the store and bought two or four more. I loved it! That lasted for about a year or two, then I started moving around the country and couldn&#x27;t find this product easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured since a great curling gel was once so easy to stumble upon, most any curling gel could do. Not a chance. I just went through a whole list of them: DevaCare Arc AnGell Extra Hold Conditioning Gel, Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper, Graham Webb: BRIT STYLE EXOTHERMIC MEDIUM HOLD GEL, some curly pudding from Target. All of them sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel, aside from Graham Webb&#x27;s Curl Defining Gel (which has been discontinued :((), has done the best things for my hair. Combo kill is: Aveda Be Curly Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, Samy Fat Hair Creme Thickening Creme, FX Curl Booster Fixative gel and Sexy Hair Big Sexy Spray. That makes for a perfect hair day. Graham Webb&#x27;s product would have kept that perfect hair day for 3-4 days but this&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for their favorite curling gel.</li>
    <li> This product gives good hold to naturally wavy/curly hair. I still use a defrizzant first. The hold is not real stiff, so the curls look natural and the hair is less prone to breakage.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best gel on the market for curly hair.  I could not live without out and everyone compliments my hair.  You apply quarter size in wet hair upside down and then scrunch with a towel.  Diffuse for 5 min and en air dry.  Perfect every time!</li>
    <li> I recently became a curly girl and like others here, tried a slew of products, none of which really impressed me.  (Me:  Caucasian, Mediterranean, 3A curls).  I tried Pantene curly gel, AVEDA confixor, and Eco styler.  The Pantene left my hair looking kind of thin and wet, the confixor didn&#x27;t have much hold, and the Eco styler left my hair feeling crunchy and dried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based on the reviews, and all I can say is Wow!  I can&#x27;t get over how this stuff makes my hair spring up!  My curls tighten up nicely with this product.  It&#x27;s pretty thrilling after years of limp frizzy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently discovered that the company renamed this and tripled the price, so I bought the 6-pack to stock up for a while.  Good price point at $6 per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;  1) I start with Giovanni Conditioner for co-wash&lt;br /&gt;  2) Leave-in conditioner:  pea sized amount of Giovanni leave-in&lt;br /&gt;  3) Use Curl Booster Gel and let air-dry.&lt;br /&gt;  4) I use the AVEDA curl booster as a nice follow-up to this.  It makes the curls look a bit tamer and tidy.</li>
    <li> I used this in the past when you could buy it in stores and was really upset when they discontinued selling it, I was really happy when I found it online however it&#x27;s different than it used to be (not as good) it&#x27;s even a different color the gel itself not the bottle outside is the same I was pretty disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have loved this hair gel for years and about a year or so ago they quit selling it in stores.  I found this deal on here and its no more than i would have paid in stores and I finally have my hair gel back.  I came sooner than estimated and the product was just what I expected....great!</li>
    <li> This makes wonderful soft curls!!  Put a good amount on wet hair, then use your defuser.  You will be amazed.  The curls are well-defined and soft and natural.  People are always asking about my curls!!  You will LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> Thee best curl gel ever  I am a hair dresser in A huge salon and spa and all my clients love curl booster by fx  my salon only carries Redfin and puroligy and both are no good wish I could buy more for less shipping</li>

    <li> why why why these companies always try to fix something that isn&#x27;t broken and now the product SUCKS I truly used nothing else before now. Now I have 6 bottles of gel I can&#x27;t use! Thanks Fx....</li>
    <li> I love this product and have found nothing else as good in the world.  I won&#x27;t use anything else ever again.</li>
