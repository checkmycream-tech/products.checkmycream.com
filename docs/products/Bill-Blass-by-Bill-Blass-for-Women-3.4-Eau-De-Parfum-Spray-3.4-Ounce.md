      <li>/&gt;Still, hard to find product at an awesome price. :)</li>
      <li>After so much looking, I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this too thinking it was my good old original Bill Blass.  </li>
      <li>so far I have had good luck..and have received  from Amazon the original fragrance.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s  original  scent...</li>
      <li>Many thanks!</li>
      <li>They should have to list in their description that this is not the original.</li>
      <li>I used the original bill blass perfume for 30 years</li>
      <li>Weaker scent than the original Bill Blass.</li>
      <li>But my bottle showed up with a significant amount gone out of it; the bottle leaks, it leaked during shipping.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>The 3 bottles were returned and a full refund was</li>
      <li>like the fresh, clean, non-floral, non-musk scent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>MILD scent of Bill</li>
      <li>CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  </li>
      <li>It is a lovely fresh and clean fragrance with just enough &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>/&gt;THE FIRST BOTTLE OF PERFUME</li>
      <li>35 YEARS LATER I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT HERE</li>
      <li>My all-time favorite fragrance from back in the day.</li>
      <li>Finally through Amazon I was able to conveniently order it.  </li>
      <li>I can cover it with a bow, and I love that Amazon sells such a large bottle for a decent price</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for carrying this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if this is the real deal because the box, bottle &amp; color of the perfume are off.</li>
      <li>Fast Ship.</li>
      <li>It appears have a much weaker smell.</li>
      <li>It is getting harder to find and it is my favorite Parfum.</li>
      <li>My mother absolutely loves this stuff and so does my aunt.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s imitation, it still smells good, however slightly different than I recall.</li>
      <li>Please in the future, compare the original product with what is sold or what will be sold through amazon.</li>
      <li>Had run out completely and was so happy to see that little white box waiting for me to get home.  </li>
      <li>I only wish they had a smaller and more intense product that I could use for travel.</li>
      <li>this fragrance was given to me in the hospital by a friend the night my daughter was born… it was a classic then, it is timeless to me now.</li>
      <li>I manage a senior high rise.</li>
      <li>If this is the way it is now, I will be finding a new scent.</li>
      <li>First, all 3 bottles visually looked &amp;#34;washed out&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I simply regret not having purchased more because the seller no longer has any; other sellers are charging much more for it, which makes purchasing multiple bottles less likely.</li>
      <li>say Natural.</li>
      <li>I did a direct comparison by spraying each scent on&lt;br</li>
      <li>It neither smells nor looks like my old Bill Blass.  </li>
      <li>The scent (doesn&#x27;t last) and color (clear) of the cologne was not the same as the original fragrance (yellow).  </li>
      <li>It had to much alcohol or some other equally harsh chemical to make the bottle I received smell more like cleaning product than a perfume.  </li>
      <li>The bottle was not the same color (white tone) of the original fragrance (yellow).  </li>
      <li>This was the FIRST time I ordered and received this exact same product that it DID NOT come close to meeting previous</li>
      <li>It does not even smell the same and the smell does not last very long like the original did.  </li>
      <li>Last, the newly received order STUNG when I sprayed it on.  </li>
      <li>I have to tell you that the Eau De Parfum  Spray was so weak, mostly alcohol or</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t take long to receive them, and the perfume boxes looked new.</li>
      <li>It is not the same color, the bottle has been changed and the cologne barely lasts an hour.  </li>
      <li>so I was very disappointed to not be able to purchase any more.</li>

<li> It is getting harder to find online and thank goodness</li>
<li> It was not as &#x27;yellow&#x27; as previously sold to her, however she is over the moon with the price and finding this product again!</li>
<li> weak watered down version of the real bill blass parfum spray....</li>
<li> The fragrance is one I can wear year round; the significance of that statement is that I have asthma and allergies, so I am limited as to which fragrances</li>
<li> ; in color....very very pale yellow...</li>
<li> I bought  one that was very pale..and yes it was very weak...</li>
<li> My only problem is that it is hard to find.</li>
<li> At least I couldn&#x27;t find it last 2 times I checked.</li>
<li> bottle of Bill Bass from a previous order (from online)...</li>
<li> It has very little scent, plus the color is not what I have been used to.</li>

    <li> My mother absolutely loves this stuff and so does my aunt. I will buy again...the price is right and the quality is great!</li>
    <li> I used the original bill blass perfume for 30 years so I was very disappointed to not be able to purchase any more. I saw this online and ordered it thinking it was the same. It wasn&#x27;t . Not even close. The packaging was the same and that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> Thanks so much for my very favorite perfume!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, have bought it for several years and never tire of its wonderful smell.  I would recommend it to any gentleman who loves his lady.</li>
    <li> I love Bill Blass. I use to buy it at Burlington Coat Factory, but they no longer sell it. When I saw it on line I was very happy. Everyone loves the way it smells on me. Thank you so much for carrying this product. I will be ordering more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;J.T.Nimmons</li>
    <li> I bought this too thinking it was my good old original Bill Blass.  It is not.  It does not even smell the same and the smell does not last very long like the original did.  Really disappointing.  They should have to list in their description that this is not the original.</li>
    <li> My sister has been looking all over for this and it the only scent she will wear. So thank goodness I found it for her, she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Now she knows the baby sister can do great things.</li>
    <li> I have to tell you that the Eau De Parfum  Spray was so weak, mostly alcohol or whatever was used to thin it out.  The price was very good but way too thinned out. I would not order it again.</li>
    <li> I understand that Bill Blass has stopped making the original scent of their awesome perfume.  I also know that in the industry others make scents very similar.  However,this IS NOT, that scent.  It had to much alcohol or some other equally harsh chemical to make the bottle I received smell more like cleaning product than a perfume.  Sad that Bill stopped making the original scent, maybe one day they will open the vault and bring it back out!</li>
    <li> weak watered down version of the real bill blass parfum spray....didnt have same color either,you dont have to use spray nozzle it leaks out like water bubbles...not good mjayfaith@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bill Blass Eau De Parfum spray for &amp;#34;years&amp;#34;...and I&#x27;ve ordered and received discounted Bill Blass on line.  This was the FIRST time I ordered and received this exact same product that it DID NOT come close to meeting previous orders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3 bottles and I only opened one.&lt;br /&gt;  First, all 3 bottles visually looked &amp;#34;washed out&amp;#34; in color....very very pale yellow...almost no color at all.&lt;br /&gt;  Second, when I sprayed it on my arm, it smelled of alcohol....NOT the lovely fragrance I am use to...I still had&lt;br /&gt;  bottle of Bill Bass from a previous order (from online)...I did a direct comparison by spraying each scent on&lt;br /&gt;  each arm of &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; person.  The scent was AWFUL on the newly received bottle!  Strong smell of alcohol very&lt;br /&gt;  MILD scent of Bill Blass.&lt;br /&gt;  Last, the newly received order STUNG when I sprayed it on.  The 3 bottles were returned and a full refund was&lt;br /&gt;  received.&lt;br /&gt;I am scared to death to order it again from &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; source online.</li>
    <li> I purchased three bottles of Bill Blass for Women for just around $11.00, which was a price that couldn&#x27;t be beaten. It didn&#x27;t take long to receive them, and the perfume boxes looked new. I gave one to a friend for her birthday, and she was pleased to receive it. I simply regret not having purchased more because the seller no longer has any; other sellers are charging much more for it, which makes purchasing multiple bottles less likely. I purchased Bill Blass because a cousin used to wear it in the &#x27;80s; I was in school and couldn&#x27;t afford to buy it, so when I saw a bottle in TJMaxx last December I bought it. The fragrance is one I can wear year round; the significance of that statement is that I have asthma and allergies, so I am limited as to which fragrances I can wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the seller: Please get more Bill Blass for Women.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bill Blass for years. I love it and get so many compliments when I wear it. People always want to know the name. It is my signature fragrance. It is getting harder to find online and thank goodness Amazon.com still has it at a really good price. I can always count on Amazon.com coming through for all my needs. Please don&#x27;t discontinue Bill Blass. I would recommend this fragrance to All my friends.</li>
    <li> Received almost on time, in good conditions and everything right. I feel satisfied with this product and looking for another opportunity for buying another one.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  I have used this Parfume for years.  What more can I say.  My only problem is that it is hard to find. Finally through Amazon I was able to conveniently order it.  Yeah!!!</li>
    <li> my &amp;#34;foster mom&amp;#34; wears this and has since I met her.. It is a lovely fresh and clean fragrance with just enough &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; fragrance that you know its a perfume and the one wearing it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;just get out of the shower&amp;#34;...a very easy fragrance to remember and when applied it lasts most of the day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for 25 yrs..I keep looking.you have to look for the Vintage  ones and are going up in price...the color has to be amber..I bought  one that was very pale..and yes it was very weak...some bottles  say Natural. ..so far I have had good luck..and have received  from Amazon the original fragrance. .during the holidays I have found great deal. wish Bill Blass  would go back to to it&#x27;s  original  scent...</li>
    <li> Weaker scent than the original Bill Blass.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years and still get compliments on it almost daily! It outranks all the newer fragrances I have. :-)</li>
    <li> Pleased to have my favorite perfume again.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in my order.  It has very little scent, plus the color is not what I have been used to. It neither smells nor looks like my old Bill Blass.  If this is the way it is now, I will be finding a new scent.</li>
    <li> this fragrance was given to me in the hospital by a friend the night my daughter was born… it was a classic then, it is timeless to me now.</li>
    <li> I have been using it since they introduced that perfume.  I only wish they had a smaller and more intense product that I could use for travel.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite so always the right buy as a gift to her, and at a great price. I like the scent as well.</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  LOS FELICITO POR PRESENTAR PRODUCTOS DE ESTA CALIDAD JSIUDIUDF IYDFIUYF</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product. Fast Ship. My mom LOVES this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;9 more words? Buy it. Good product. Smells good.</li>
    <li> I manage a senior high rise. A resident requested help finding this item. Was hard to find in Denver, CO; however I ordered it for her on Amazon. It was not as &#x27;yellow&#x27; as previously sold to her, however she is over the moon with the price and finding this product again! Many thanks!</li>
    <li> This perfurme does not smell quite like another bottle I purchased at the store.  It appears have a much weaker smell.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the arrival time.  Arrived July 18th instead of July 20th.  Had run out completely and was so happy to see that little white box waiting for me to get home.  Have used Bill Blass for years.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good price and delivery.</li>
    <li> IN 1975 THIS WAS THE PERFUME TO WEAR. 35 YEARS LATER I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT HERE ON AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE FIRST BOTTLE OF PERFUME I RECEIVED WOULD NOT SPRAY AND THE BOTTLE WAS CRACKED.</li>
    <li> It was great finding Bill Blass for Women. It is getting harder to find and it is my favorite Parfum.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this fragrance, and I love Amazon for selling it so cheap. But my bottle showed up with a significant amount gone out of it; the bottle leaks, it leaked during shipping. The perfume ate through the paint on the cap. I can cover it with a bow, and I love that Amazon sells such a large bottle for a decent price, I&#x27;m just a little disappointed the bottle is defective. I wanted to give this to my mother for Christmas. I&#x27;m sure she knows what I got her since my room now smells like Bill Blass.&lt;br /&gt;Still, hard to find product at an awesome price. :)</li>
    <li> The price was so fantastic I should have known that something was wrong.  The place (Company) or person that I bought this item from through you (amazon) cloned the bottles and the scent.  The scent (doesn&#x27;t last) and color (clear) of the cologne was not the same as the original fragrance (yellow).  The bottle was not the same color (white tone) of the original fragrance (yellow).  Even the emblem was cloned.  Please in the future, compare the original product with what is sold or what will be sold through amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bill Blass for 20 years and I was very disappointed to find that this product has been watered down.  It is not the same color, the bottle has been changed and the cologne barely lasts an hour.  I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> After so much looking, I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it.  I know where to go to now...Thank you.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite scent.  I am always being asked what I am using.  It&#x27;s not the latest &amp;#34;flavor of the month&amp;#34;, but it has en-dured because it smells so good.</li>
    <li> I use to buy Bill Blass until they stopped selling it.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fresh, clean, non-floral, non-musk scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always told others about it - after I&#x27;ve bought my own.</li>
    <li> When the product was delivered, the smell was overwhelming. The bottle had leaked ruining the box and depleting the product by a quarter. It was a mother &#x27;s day gift and I couldn&#x27;t &#x27;t give it to my mother -in -law. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite fragrance from back in the day. It&#x27;s getting harder to find it. I used to get it at Perfumania, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore. At least I couldn&#x27;t find it last 2 times I checked. I&#x27;m wondering if this is the real deal because the box, bottle &amp; color of the perfume are off. If it&#x27;s imitation, it still smells good, however slightly different than I recall.</li>
