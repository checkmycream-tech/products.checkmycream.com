### Positive Reviews

      <li>Best sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer and sun block.  </li>
      <li>I put a bit of Palmer&#x27;s Coconut oil on my face every morning and follow it with this wonderful stuff for both my makeup and sunscreen.  </li>

      <li>I used to use this for years and told many friends about it</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>so it was fantastic under makeup or just with powder on top.</li>
      <li>no need to be have a white hue on your skin to get good protection!</li>
      <li>For anyone interested, I&#x27;ll post the link to the dermatologist&#x27;s website so that you can see her reviews and maybe get some ideas for more products to try!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something lightweight that will wash off easily this is probably not for you.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily, feels like silk and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s easy to apply and non-sticky.  </li>
      <li>I loved the older version of this.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert and have fair skin.  </li>
      <li>It still looks fine</li>
      <li>I am not a \\&quot;leave a detailed review\\&quot; kind of gal, but will review this hoping it will encourage someone else to give it a try because I like it that much!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 41 now and fortunately have always had pretty nice skin.</li>
      <li>According to the doc, anything over 30 spf is just sales hype and doesn&#x27;t really do any significantly better protection - hey!</li>
      <li>Goes on super smooth and is a matte finish which I love in the summer time.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and can be a fantastic primer for a light foundation.</li>
      <li>It is smooth, silky and it acts like foundation.</li>
      <li>how smooth and velvety this is.</li>
      <li>In addition to a sunblock it imparts a smooth non greasy finish.  </li>
      <li>I like that this is fragrance free and the light tint helps it to blend well.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a physical sunscreen with great protection that is water/sweat resistant</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and think it&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I tend to have those hormonal breakouts around my chin, but I still feel comfortable using this on my face.  </li>
      <li>I loved the old formula.</li>
      <li>This was originally given to me by a consultant at my dermatologists&#x27; office.  </li>
      <li>it is a bit greasier than i would prefer, but generally it feels good on my face.</li>
      <li>I got a really nice matte, but not flat, finish, that I would have been more than content to leave the house with.</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of different sunscreens for my face and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>It also is great for dry to medium skin since it is like a moisturizer, also.</li>
      <li>Since the first time I purchased the packaging changed, but same great product.</li>
      <li>Powder on skin with larger pores is usually a huge no-no for me, but the finish was even better!    </li>
      <li>The new product is much more watery and doesn&#x27;t have the same, smooth primer feel that made it so perfect as a daily sunscreen for under make-up.</li>
      <li>The tinted cream (formerly tinted gel) gives you a perfect oil free look that lasts all day long!</li>
      <li>MD Solar Sciences Tinted Cream SPF 30 did not provide adequate protection.</li>
      <li>This new formulation flows onto your face much better, is easier to apply, and absorbs into skin well.</li>
      <li>I loved the old formula but the new formula feels greasy and causes my make-up to slide off quickly.</li>
      <li>Very greasy!!  </li>
      <li>The original was great because it wasn&#x27;t too slick and it also acted like a primer</li>
      <li>It covers little skin flaws and looks great.  </li>
      <li>Amazing coverage for the sun and the tint hides tiny imperfections and smooths skin</li>
      <li>This is the only sunscreen I have ever liked on my face.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Texture is fabulous, no need to keep &#x27;rubbing&#x27; as with many physical sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If they change the formula (again), I would give it a try, because the high zinc percentage and tint are appealing to me, but this formula has just way too much silicone for me.</li>
      <li>It glides right on and melts into the skin.  </li>
      <li>The active ingredients work well for me -- no stinging, and they offer good sun protection.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for better, I use it on my face only, but it doesn&#x27;t soak in, it leaves me feeling super greasy</li>
      <li>Excerpts and links may be used, provided that full and clear credit is given to Angela Risner with appropriate and specific direction to the original content.</li>
      <li>, I just can&#x27;t use it for very much of anything.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was a little shocked when this product arrived.  I didn&#x27;t realize it was so small.  Besides being expensive for it&#x27;s size, I like that it is a &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; and that the texture is so smooth.  It also gives fairly good coverage.  I am not sure if I would order it again because of the price.  Maybe if they re-packaged this as a primer or BB cream I could understand why I would spend that much money on a small little tube of SPF.</li>
    <li> The color is great. Really smooths out my ski tone and looks like I&#x27;m not wearing anything. Seems to be a good sunscreen. While I do still use it occasionally, it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin. So my skin feels kinds greasy. It still looks fine but I don&#x27;t like the way it feels.  I&#x27;m disappointed about that because I would use it every day</li>
    <li> Not only is the sunscreen light-feeling, because it is tinted, you don&#x27;t have white splotchiness when you apply. It also helps to cover tan lines.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this and just am in love. I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time outside but how smooth and velvety this is. How is goes on. Its awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is pricy but you get what you pay for, so it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I got mine at Sephora, as it&#x27;s unavailable on Amazon. :( So if you can&#x27;t get it on amazon, please run to your local Sephora store and get it. Try it out. You will fall in love.</li>
    <li> The color was great ,  It was non- irritating and non drying  however it felt like it could slide off my face and yet it wasn&#x27;t really greasy.  I can&#x27;t decide whether to repurchase because I didn&#x27;t like the slick feel.</li>
    <li> My go to facial sunscreen. I bought a few different sunblocks last summer to try out, and this one was my all time favorite. I apply it over my moisturizer, it is non-greasy, easy to rub in, and the tint is wonderful. It&#x27;s very light in coloring, enough to give a small covering, but still leaves a very natural look. I will be buying more for this summer.</li>
    <li> The tinted cream (formerly tinted gel) gives you a perfect oil free look that lasts all day long! Amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I found that goes on like a regular face moisturizer and does not smell like sunscreen. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I loved the older version of this. When they changed it to this one, I&#x27;m not sure what they added to it or deleted from it, but it&#x27;s super greasy now.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different sunscreens for my face and this is by far the best. It goes on easily, feels like silk and lasts all day. It&#x27;s easy to apply my makeup over it and great for those &amp;#34;no makeup days&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t be afraid because it&#x27;s tinted; it doesn&#x27;t add color, it just doesn&#x27;t look white like most sunscreens. I prefer it over their non tinted sunscreen because I think it even outs my skin tone a little.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I have ever liked on my face.  I tend to have those hormonal breakouts around my chin, but I still feel comfortable using this on my face.  It has a nice velvety finish and I love tha it has a little tint vs having a white clown looking puttiness that most other sunscreens leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice when I wear this, that it does sit in my pores, leaving the appearance of blackheads around my nose area.  Maybe my cleaner doesn&#x27;t penetrate well enough. But if that&#x27;s the tradeoff to help prevent wrinkles, then I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
    <li> Very greasy and very thick like a mud. I think it is a bad choice , especially for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Effective and tint blends nicely. Dermatolist recommended after receiving PDT treatment for sun damage. Has slight slick feeling initially but absorbs nicely</li>
    <li> Tried it a few times, went back to the original with no color, love the original, have been using it for five years, a must before applying makeup, then I use powder or bronzer. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice SPF crème.  Finishes with a great matte look.  For the price 1.7 oz. in a tube just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t complain about the tint, it helped to cover my face where I had uneven pigmentation. However, although I used the mineral cream generously, it did not protect my skin from sun damage. Anyone who has a Melasma condition knows that using the proper sunscreen protection will prevent increased pigmentation damage when exposed to the sun. MD Solar Sciences Tinted Cream SPF 30 did not provide adequate protection. Additionally, the cream never dried, just remained on my skin slimy and wet.</li>
    <li> I loved the old formula. Sometimes when companies &#x27;improve&#x27; their products they mess it up. The original was great because it wasn&#x27;t too slick and it also acted like a primer so it was fantastic under makeup or just with powder on top. I would even wear it by itself since it didn&#x27;t make my skin look oily. Now, its slippery and is not good under makeup. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!!!!!! I will not reorder at this time. I used to use this for years and told many friends about it so I hope MD Solar Sciences will listen to its customers</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the SPF and a recommendation from a dermatology site.  Now it&#x27;s my favorite go-to makeup!  The texture is velvet--like a whipped mousse.  It goes on softly and absorbs smoothly without any residue/moisture.  My skin has larger pores and uneven color, but this creme helps even it out.  I use additional mineral concealer for trouble spots.  I have had no problems with breakouts or irritations--I love the protection and coverage this product provides!</li>
    <li> I used to use the gel which wasn&#x27;t greasy and slippery on my face. They discontinued it. This is its replacement and you vacant wear it under makeup like the gel. I wish they would PLEASE bring back the gel!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. Has a slight tint to cover skin evenly. Not drying or oily. Tones and brightens the skin for everyday use. I also use it at night instead of makeup.. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like that this is fragrance free and the light tint helps it to blend well.  Also, it&#x27;s easy to apply and non-sticky.  I like also that it contains only two ingredients -- zinc and titanium.</li>
    <li> love this - acts as a light foundation also and is silky and smooth - purchased it for my family and girlfriends also!!</li>
    <li> So I just received a tube of this that I purchased from a dermatologist for $32 and am beyond pleased that I can repurchase on Amazon for almost $10 less with free Prime shipping. I am not a \\&quot;leave a detailed review\\&quot; kind of gal, but will review this hoping it will encourage someone else to give it a try because I like it that much! First off, my mom/best friend passed away 15 years ago from malignant melanoma so I have since become somewhat of an SPF preacher since. I&#x27;m 41 now and fortunately have always had pretty nice skin. I&#x27;m normal with a tendency toward dry in the winter. I&#x27;ve got pretty bad dark circles under my eyes (hereditary) and have developed some redness from broken capillaries here and there. And I&#x27;m really pale, by choice. I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of make-up and usually don&#x27;t wear much other than sunscreen, unless I&#x27;m going out somewhere. Even some BB and CC creams feel too heavy and greasy to me. The dermatologist raved about this being her favorite facial sunscreen product and here&#x27;s what I thought:    My getting older skin has some issues with larger pores and fine lines, which also contributes to my not liking to wear foundation as it always tends to settle and draw attention, and I&#x27;ve tried about every primer out there - both low and high end. This crème worked nicely to prime and blur these problems. The texture is light - almost a whipped consistency, and didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy AT ALL! There is zero typical sunscreen odor. The color of the tint disappeared on my fair to light colored skin, without having to blend and rub in forever. It doesn&#x27;t have the typical shiny finish that many other tinted sunscreens or BB creams tend to have - I got a really nice matte, but not flat, finish, that I would have been more than content to leave the house with. Since I was experimenting though, I applied a pressed mineral foundation (also with SPF from the same dermatologist) on top of it, which for me was the real test. Powder on skin with larger pores is usually a huge no-no for me, but the finish was even better!    Long story short, I will be using this product in place of all other BB and CC creams, tinted SPFs and tinted moisturizer. Finish is still flawless 7 hours after applying and I will most definitely be purchasing more. For anyone interested, I&#x27;ll post the link to the dermatologist&#x27;s website so that you can see her reviews and maybe get some ideas for more products to try! (I hated Bare Minerals foundation but am quite pleased with her Baked Mineral Makeup as well!)    [...]</li>
    <li> Amazing coverage for the sun and the tint hides tiny imperfections and smooths skin so I dont even need to wear any other makeup. Plus i love the silky, weightless, non greasy feel. A must for summer,</li>
    <li> I loved, loved, loved the MD solar science tinted gel.  When I couldn&#x27;t find it I ordered this instead.  While I&#x27;m sure it does a nice job it leave my face looking a bit chalky.  The tinted gel was much nicer.  I hope they bring it back!</li>
    <li> i like it and use it every day.  Would like to find an smaller size for my gym bag though.</li>
    <li> Because of a medication, I have issues with breakouts. This help even out my skin tone. I&#x27;m not normally someone who cares about sunscreen (I know, I know), but I like wearing this to the pool. It doesn&#x27;t stay on forever, of course, but I do like that it makes my skin look better without looking fake.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;© Angela Risner 2014.

    <li> Best sunscreen I have ever used. I love this tinted sunscreen. Glides on like silk. I have sensitive, oily skin, and this works perfect.</li>
    <li> Pros:  This is the first facial sunscreen that did not sting my face at all.  I have very sensitive skin prone to redness, irritation, dryness, and cyclical little breakouts despite my age (50), and this sunscreen does not irritate or redden my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It comes in one color that is too dark for me.  It moves around on the face, even hours later, making streaks, so it&#x27;s visible on the face.  I live in Southern California, and it doesn&#x27;t block the sun enough.  I get sun changes on my face just from the incidental exposure of going to work and doing errands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They need to make a range of tints, figure out how to make it not budge without blocking pores, and raise the SPF to 50.</li>
    <li> I use this product on the advice of my dermatologist (who charges nearly double).  I like the feel, the fact that it goes on silky and typically stays a matte finish.  I usually wear it alone without any additional foundation.  The tint is realy light and does not cover all my problem areas but for daily use it fits the bill - if I want additonal coverage I just use a touch of concealer.  It is very water resistant, I live in Florida so that to me means sweat proof, even on the hottest days it stays put.  I like the product, I love the price and I would recomend it to anyone looking for daily wear.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is smooth, silky and it acts like foundation. It is great to use after a moisturizer</li>
    <li> This is a great product:  I use as foundation for face.  In addition to a sunblock it imparts a smooth non greasy finish.  Unfortunately the  old formula was better but the new one is still good.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product idea, but unfortunately my face developed an itchy rash.  However, I have extremely sensitive skin so probably not a good test case.  I passed it on to my daughter and she loves it and uses it regularly.</li>
    <li> The color blended well with my skin tone, I loved the non greasy texture and I haven&#x27;t got any sun due to the high zinc concentration of this creme. I cannot live without it!</li>
    <li> This product goes one very smoothly and evens skin tone.  It stays on even when at the beach and swimming  no need to be have a white hue on your skin to get good protection!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent sunscreen and is completely non-irritating.  However, it is so incredibly slippery and silicone-laden, I just can&#x27;t use it for very much of anything.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t work under makeup - unless I want my makeup to slide off.  On no makeup days, it is ok, but it never dries down, so my face is wet for the entire day.  It&#x27;s just got a very weird consistency.  If they change the formula (again), I would give it a try, because the high zinc percentage and tint are appealing to me, but this formula has just way too much silicone for me.</li>
    <li> Great spf and covers redness.  Wish it was not so pricey!</li>
    <li> My most recent purchase of this product had a very different formulation than previous bottles. The new product is much more watery and doesn&#x27;t have the same, smooth primer feel that made it so perfect as a daily sunscreen for under make-up. I will be looking for a new sunscreen!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  I live in the desert and have fair skin.  I won&#x27;t ever be without it again.  I put a bit of Palmer&#x27;s Coconut oil on my face every morning and follow it with this wonderful stuff for both my makeup and sunscreen.  It covers little skin flaws and looks great.  I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> This tinted creme is lightweight has just a hint of color.  It&#x27;s very creamy and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores plus it has spf 30.  It arrived in the original packaging and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for better, I use it on my face only, but it doesn&#x27;t soak in, it leaves me feeling super greasy and I STILL get burnt!! Also not good if you&#x27;re snorkeling because it fogs up your mask! Gave it 3 stars because its natural and doesn&#x27;t make me break out, also like the tint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and think it&#x27;s wonderful.  It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer and sun block.  The only problem with the packaging is that it gets to hard to squeeze the product out too soon.</li>
    <li> It goes on incredibly smoothly and feels silky, not sticky like usual sunscreen.  and it does not make my skin break out which is something that always happens when I use chemical sunscreen. It is pricey, however.</li>
    <li> Oilier than expected hard to use with makeup. Will not reorder at this time . I am sure will work for others.</li>
    <li> I loved the old formula but the new formula feels greasy and causes my make-up to slide off quickly. Also, if I wear this during an outdoor workout (without make-up, of course) my skin breaks out like crazy. I don&#x27;t believe the new formula is non-comedogenic. Please bring back the old version!</li>
    <li> This is another item recommended by my doctor (the one who did the laser surgery for rosacea) and damned if it doesn&#x27;t work. I smeared some on the other day - a nice southern California fall afternoon - and went for a three hour motorcycle ride without even a blush afterwards. According to the doc, anything over 30 spf is just sales hype and doesn&#x27;t really do any significantly better protection - hey! if you want to argue, I&#x27;ll give you his phone number. Also the tinted stuff kinda helps those of us with ruddy skin (that Scot thing, you know) to tone down the natural redness a bit. Haven&#x27;t really noticed any odor to it.&lt;br /&gt;OK, sun&#x27;s out, gotta give it another road test.</li>
    <li> This was originally given to me by a consultant at my dermatologists&#x27; office.  I recommend this product to people who are out in the sun quite a bit and don&#x27;t like to look make up at all.  It also is great for dry to medium skin since it is like a moisturizer, also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using MD Solar sunscreens for the past year, and have been very satisfied with them.  The active ingredients work well for me -- no stinging, and they offer good sun protection.  At the end of the day, it&#x27;s tougher to wash off than other products, but there&#x27;s something to be said for that: It stays on all day -- does not run.  This new formulation flows onto your face much better, is easier to apply, and absorbs into skin well.</li>
    <li> It goes on lovely, a bit gooie (for want of a better word) on the face.  Meaning you feel it on there with your fingers.  But the coverage is beautiful, and the ingredients are the best.  I&#x27;m going to even buy the spf 50 sunscreen next.  I sooooo believe in this brand for quality ingredients.  Nothing toxic!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist a year ago.  She said my skin was very dry.  So, I ordered it on line.  I applied the creme mornings and it made my skin feel soft, never greasy and never dry.  After I ran out of it, I bought a BB product in a local store, but returned it because it dried out my skin.  So, I went back to using MD  Solar Sciences Mineral Tinted Creme.  I am a woman in my seventies and I have always had sensitive skin, but this creme works for me.</li>
    <li> Good product. Had sampled in dermatologist office and like the weight and silky feel. Can easily be used as base. A little expensive for me for use as general sunscreen so I just use for face. Since the first time I purchased the packaging changed, but same great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m throwing this away.  It&#x27;s too greasy -- clogged my pores, and now i&#x27;ve got whiteheads.  Hate it!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t step out of the house without this now. It goes on smooth and can be a fantastic primer for a light foundation. Color blends well and is sheer.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on like silk.  Evens complexion. This is my second tube. Does not irritate my eyes. Recommend it</li>
    <li> I love it!  Goes on super smooth and is a matte finish which I love in the summer time.</li>
    <li> Very greasy!!  Hate the way it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> this cream is great, works like a concealer with lightly covering color, and leaves my rosacea bothered skin feeling light and smooth. it is a bit greasier than i would prefer, but generally it feels good on my face. and i don&#x27;t get burnt!</li>
    <li> Looks as natural as I could hope. No more clown face! Regular sunscreen always left my face looking somewhat shinny and very white. It is a product I need. NOTE: It has stained a couple of my undershirts and t-shirts and probably some other non-white shirts but it since it doesn&#x27;t show as readily I haven&#x27;t noticed. It&#x27;s worth it. Definitely want to put the shirt on first, or if it&#x27;s a favorite shirt, choose one or the other that day.</li>
    <li> This is the new formulation of the old tinted gel.  They&#x27;ve added an antioxidant complex (green tea, cranberry, pomegranate &amp; vitamin c), and the texture is also better.  The tint becomes fairly transparent once on the skin so I think it would suit a wide range of skin tones (I am fair skinned with a golden undertone).  It blurs imperfections like a primer does due to the silica. Texture is fabulous, no need to keep &#x27;rubbing&#x27; as with many physical sunscreens.  It glides right on and melts into the skin.  It&#x27;s tenacious (water resistant up to 80 mins) so it probably requires a cleansing oil to remove it well.  If you&#x27;re looking for something lightweight that will wash off easily this is probably not for you.  If you&#x27;re looking for a physical sunscreen with great protection that is water/sweat resistant this is a good choice.  There is also a non-tinted version (spf 50) which did not leave a white cast, and pretty much everything else I said here applies to the non-tinted one as well.</li>
