### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best curling wand ever.</li>
      <li>This makes beautiful beach like waves and the pearl allows for it to not look like a perfect spiral.</li>
      <li>This wand beautifully curled my hair in about 7 minutes.</li>
      <li>So, I finished up, tipped my head over and shook out the curls, and they were BEAUTIFUL.  </li>
      <li>Really happy with the curling iron.</li>
      <li>Great price for this product</li>
      <li>I feel like this isn&#x27;t very honest of NUME</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s AMAZING!</li>
      <li>It works great and my hair looks amazing.</li>
      <li>My co-workers and I were having a discussion about good irons and wands to use.</li>
      <li>Love the curls I get with this wand !</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I thought it made amazing hair curls</li>
      <li>thing is simply amazing.  </li>
      <li>but I ended up loving the results.</li>
      <li>that are cone shaped in design; but, the unique design of this one is more ideal for my needs.  </li>
      <li>When it came, I thought it looked like some bizarre toy for the bedroom, laughed a bit, and shut the box.  </li>
      <li>However, with this product I am able to do my own hair.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to use and because of the kind of curl</li>
      <li>I love NUME curling wands.  </li>
      <li>but, this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>I would love to be able to recommend them to friends and family, but do not feel like I can do this.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>You also won&#x27;t be able to beat this price anywhere else.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t use it more than twice a week.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>If you are thinking of getting this iron I say do it :)</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, love the results, heats very quickly</li>
      <li>I love this curling iron, it makes curling my hair so easy.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love how quick and easy it is!</li>
      <li>I have partially curly hair and this pearl curling iron is soooo perfect!!</li>
      <li>The curls are beautiful spirals, not the traditional ringlet curl</li>
      <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it</li>
      <li>But i definitely recommend this product to get unique beautiful curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
      <li>The product description is absolutely accurate.  </li>
      <li>the only reason I got this is because it was on groupon for a great price.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and heats up quickly.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>I love this unit so much I am considering getting another one for back-up.</li>
      <li>More than 24 hours later, the next night as I was going to bed, it was still beautifully curled.  </li>
      <li>Even without the improvement, I am able to curl my own hair because even though the hair lapses over itself on the barrel, it is hot enough to curl all of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Heats up fast and gives a great natural looking wave/curl for my straight hair.</li>
      <li>so worth the $$</li>
      <li>have baby fine hair, but ten tons of it (when I get my hair cut and colored, I&#x27;m there for EASILY 3 hours).  </li>
      <li>The seller shopper this product super fast.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair EXACTLY how I want it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d really recommend it!</li>
      <li>This curling iron performs exactly like I had hoped it would.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;s my experience with my first use:&lt;br /&gt;Showered</li>
      <li>I woke up in the morning anticipating that I would have to recurl my hair, but much to my surprise, it was STILL CURLY!  </li>
      <li>👍👍 heats fast &amp; curls hold all day!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a messy look, but not in a good way.  </li>
      <li>First of all, it would normally take me between 45 minutes and an hour to curl my hair.  </li>
      <li>I can do my whole head in about 15 to 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>and it is stick straight.</li>
      <li>I much prefer wrapping around a 1&amp;#34; curling iron.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this wand!</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t own one, you&#x27;re honestly missing out.</li>
      <li>I love my other curling wands;</li>
      <li>The wand has a stand like many of your clip curling irons so when you put the unit down, the surface is protected from the heat (410 degrees).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s practically brand new!</li>
      <li>Normally, when I curl my hair, I have to use no conditioner in the shower (which makes it a bear when I&#x27;m trying to brush it out), then use mousse, add some heat protectant spray, then use hairspray before AND after using the curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I love the uneven curls.</li>
      <li>I am not a girly; doing my own hair presents a challenge to say the least.  </li>
      <li>, used the normal amount of conditioner (literally a palm full), let my hair air dry.  </li>
      <li>weird shape makes it easy to do different types of textured curls.&lt;br /&gt;i love it!</li>
      <li>- you don&#x27;t have to curl your whole head if you don&#x27;t want to because the curls look good not perfect anyway.</li>
      <li>i threw out my old curling irons!</li>
      <li>Please be aware before you purchase a NUME wand that they do not back up their products and will ask you to pay for their mistakes.</li>
      <li>This was a huge waste of money for me.</li>
      <li>After three weeks of deciding whether or not I could justify paying that much for a curling iron, I decided to open it up and give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m not one to pay more than $15 for a curling iron, but....  </li>
      <li>The curls are so natural looking because of the design of the iron.  </li>
      <li>It works well, it gets hot, and the curls in my hair last through the next day or two.</li>
      <li>It will cost me $20, plus I have to ship my old one to them and then pay shipping to send the new one back.</li>
      <li>I received numerous compliments on my new hair styles and know you will too.  </li>
      <li>After all, my wand is only three months old</li>
      <li>It is the easiest thing to use, it heats up really fast, and as long as you&#x27;re not leaving it on your hair too long, it causes zero breakage and damage....</li>

<li> The wand is light weigh; at no time did my arms get tired which happens when I try to blow dry my hair.  </li>
<li> I was on the actual retailer&#x27;s website and found a promo code - one of my favorite things! - and got this bad boy for $24.99.  </li>

<li> I have African American hair that has been chemically relaxed that almost reaches my behind, long.</li>
<li> I have tried other curling wands (Remington, NuMe, and Amika)</li>
<li> This isn&#x27;t worth the money and curls come out weird and uneven.</li>
<li> It take a few tries to get used to the barrel and how it will work with ones hair.</li>
<li> Tuesday when I was using it I noticed it was cooling down.  </li>
<li> This thing took me less than 20.  </li>
<li> The instrument heats up in no time (less than a minute).  </li>
<li> I have really long, thick hair.</li>
<li> Too tight of curls</li>
<li> I thought maybe something was wrong with the outlet and plugged my flat iron in to test it.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
<li> Sadly, I can no longer recommend Nume to anyone.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well and allows for different lolks</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron, it makes curling my hair so easy. The seller shopper this product super fast. I got it the same week I ordered it. You also won&#x27;t be able to beat this price anywhere else. Worth it!</li>
    <li> My co-workers and I were having a discussion about good irons and wands to use. One girl was ranting and raving over this product. She brought it in the next day and curled all our hair. I have really long, thick hair. This wand beautifully curled my hair in about 7 minutes. It is the easiest thing to use, it heats up really fast, and as long as you&#x27;re not leaving it on your hair too long, it causes zero breakage and damage....and that&#x27;s coming from a blonde who has highlighted her hair for years! I highly recommend this wand! I absolutely love how quick and easy it is!</li>
    <li> the only reason I got this is because it was on groupon for a great price. I have used everything on the market to curl my hair and the curls NEVER lasted. This is the only thing that keeps curls in my hair ALL night. I am so inlove with this curling wand, finally I found something that works.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not one to pay more than $15 for a curling iron, but....  One of the girls I work with has been telling me for two years that I need to buy one of these.  I was on the actual retailer&#x27;s website and found a promo code - one of my favorite things! - and got this bad boy for $24.99.  So, of course, I gave it a shot.  When it came, I thought it looked like some bizarre toy for the bedroom, laughed a bit, and shut the box.  After three weeks of deciding whether or not I could justify paying that much for a curling iron, I decided to open it up and give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine hair, but ten tons of it (when I get my hair cut and colored, I&#x27;m there for EASILY 3 hours).  Normally, when I curl my hair, I have to use no conditioner in the shower (which makes it a bear when I&#x27;m trying to brush it out), then use mousse, add some heat protectant spray, then use hairspray before AND after using the curling iron.  At that point, it finally takes the heat and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but STILL falls out within two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my experience with my first use:&lt;br /&gt;Showered, used the normal amount of conditioner (literally a palm full), let my hair air dry.  I used ZERO product, and then started curling.  First of all, it would normally take me between 45 minutes and an hour to curl my hair.  This thing took me less than 20.  So, I finished up, tipped my head over and shook out the curls, and they were BEAUTIFUL.  This was at 8:00 at night, so I went about my night and went to bed.  I woke up in the morning anticipating that I would have to recurl my hair, but much to my surprise, it was STILL CURLY!  More than 24 hours later, the next night as I was going to bed, it was still beautifully curled.  No product, and 20 minutes for a night out, an overnight, and an entire next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is simply amazing.  If you don&#x27;t own one, you&#x27;re honestly missing out.</li>
    <li> I watched a DIY on pinterest and wanted this curling iron ASAP! I have fine hair but a lot of it and it is stick straight. This makes beautiful beach like waves and the pearl allows for it to not look like a perfect spiral. It take a few tries to get used to the barrel and how it will work with ones hair. I also have the Sultra and I am not a big fan of it anymore since buying this. If you are thinking of getting this iron I say do it :)</li>
    <li> I have long hair and thought this would help me with the long curl/beach wave look. It doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a messy look, but not in a good way.  I much prefer wrapping around a 1&amp;#34; curling iron. This was a huge waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Love the curls I get with this wand ! I&#x27;ll never go back to anything else!👍👍 heats fast &amp; curls hold all day!</li>
    <li> i threw out my old curling irons! this is all i need!&lt;br /&gt;i have thin straight hair, when i curl it, it goes flat in 10 minutes. not with this wand tho!&lt;br /&gt;i curl my hair before an 8 hour shift at work and when i get home, it&#x27;s still curly!!&lt;br /&gt;the weird shape makes it easy to do different types of textured curls.&lt;br /&gt;i love it! so worth the $$</li>
    <li> Easy to use and heats up quickly. Really happy with the curling iron.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very easy to use, love the results, heats very quickly</li>
    <li> This curling iron performs exactly like I had hoped it would.  The curls are beautiful spirals, not the traditional ringlet curl&lt;br /&gt;which I did not want.  It was easy to use and because of the kind of curl - you don&#x27;t have to curl your whole head if you don&#x27;t want to because the curls look good not perfect anyway. I have partially curly hair and this pearl curling iron is soooo perfect!!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Too tight of curls and it looks too crimpy. I wanted loose waves.</li>
    <li> The product description is absolutely accurate.  This is the best curling wand ever. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  I am not a girly; doing my own hair presents a challenge to say the least.  However, with this product I am able to do my own hair.  You just wrap your hair around the barrel of the unit and hold it for about 15 mins seconds.  The size of the curls depends on the amount of hair you put on the wand and the length of time you leave the hair on the wand.  I can do my whole head in about 15 to 25 minutes. I can give myself loose \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; waves to Shirley Temple curls. I have African American hair that has been chemically relaxed that almost reaches my behind, long. The only improvement I can think of for this wand is to make it longer. Even without the improvement, I am able to curl my own hair because even though the hair lapses over itself on the barrel, it is hot enough to curl all of my hair.  The instrument heats up in no time (less than a minute).  The curls are so natural looking because of the design of the iron.  I have tried other curling wands (Remington, NuMe, and Amika) that are cone shaped in design; but, the unique design of this one is more ideal for my needs.  My curls last for days without the aid of hairspray.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong I love my other curling wands; but, this one is my favorite.  The unit comes with a heat protective glove; but, I don&#x27;t use it and I haven&#x27;t burn myself.  The wand has a stand like many of your clip curling irons so when you put the unit down, the surface is protected from the heat (410 degrees). The wand is light weigh; at no time did my arms get tired which happens when I try to blow dry my hair.  I received numerous compliments on my new hair styles and know you will too.  I love this unit so much I am considering getting another one for back-up.</li>
    <li> This wand gives my hair such volume it&#x27;s ridiculous! Worth every penny! I don&#x27;t have to use hair spray when using this wand, because the curls just seem to really last!</li>
    <li> I love NUME curling wands.  I have the Curl Jam set, the reverse wand and the pearl wand.  I always get compliments when I use them.  Sadly, I can no longer recommend Nume to anyone.  I bought my curl jam set in October.  Tuesday when I was using it I noticed it was cooling down.  I thought maybe something was wrong with the outlet and plugged my flat iron in to test it.  Not my outlet.  I contacted NUME yesterday for a replacement.  After all, my wand is only three months old and I don&#x27;t use it more than twice a week.  It&#x27;s practically brand new! I didn&#x27;t drop it or anything like that so it must be a faulty wand.  It says it has a four year warranty.  Sadly, I was told that I would have to pay to have it replaced.  It will cost me $20, plus I have to ship my old one to them and then pay shipping to send the new one back. o basically because they sent me a faulty product, I have to pay close to $40 total to get it replaced.  I feel like this isn&#x27;t very honest of NUME considering that I can&#x27;t find anywhere on their site where this is stated and even asked the customer service rep where it was written.  Not to mention the fact that they sold me an expensive, but flawed product and are asking me to pay for their mistake.  Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying anymore products from NUME.  I would love to be able to recommend them to friends and family, but do not feel like I can do this.  Please be aware before you purchase a NUME wand that they do not back up their products and will ask you to pay for their mistakes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s AMAZING! It works well, it gets hot, and the curls in my hair last through the next day or two. I&#x27;d really recommend it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I have lived for so long without this curling wand. Leaves my hair EXACTLY how I want it and I can totally control how curly I want my hair. Absolutely love it. Thinking about getting a second one for when this one stops working (hopefully never!).</li>
    <li> I bought this product after having seen a tutorial online by trish paytas. I thought it made amazing hair curls and I had always been looking for a curling wand. When I tried to look this one up though I had difficulty finding it until I found the site, found the product and searched amazon and voila! Great price for this product and it works like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. The only thing is its a bit tricky to curl your hair without burning yourself. They do come with a mitt, which makes it a bit easier but also a bit more difficult to grasp the hair. I unfortunately lost mine somewhere and burnt myself too many times so I refuse to use it until I either find the mitt or buy another. But i definitely recommend this product to get unique beautiful curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High heat setting ensures curls stay longer.</li>
    <li> Love it. Was not sure what to do with it as I first began to use it but I ended up loving the results. Heats up fast and gives a great natural looking wave/curl for my straight hair.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap. Get the Bedhead curl pup wand for 1/3 of the price. This isn&#x27;t worth the money and curls come out weird and uneven.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing it on Pinterest. It works great and my hair looks amazing. I love the uneven curls.</li>
