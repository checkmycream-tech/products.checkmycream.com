<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product arrived on time, but it was not a good product for what it was suppose to do. I did not light up under the teenie tiny black light that is included.  So therefore it did not serve its purpose.  I have used germ glo before in a classroom setting and this product was not stronger enough to even show under the light.  I would not buy this again!</li>
    <li> We used this for a Girl Scout and it worked great.  There was plenty solution for our large troop.</li>
    <li> The Germ liquid worked, but the light did not.  We had to go a store and buy a light.</li>
    <li> Great tool for educating staff</li>
    <li> Kids thought seeing germs was really cool. Kids definatly learned about germs from the experience. As an adult I was grossed out by how many germs are trapped under my ring.</li>
    <li> Hours of germs exposed fun! Kids ages 8-14 enjoyed this product. I&lt;br /&gt;Purchased a black light to reveal the germs better then the little keypad light but the black light was broken! Thank goodness the little key pad did the job!</li>
    <li> It was not what I thought it was but it was my fault for not reading.. I love it tho!</li>
    <li> Perfect for 2nd grader science project. Wish they includes littler bigger glo light but over all gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Received product fast. Black light is so small it was difficult to use with a classroom. We used a box with holes in it for the kids to put their hands into. However, the lotion did not really show up this way. We ended up using Glo-Germ powder that someone else had.</li>
    <li> the kit worked for a science project and to teach hand washing importance.</li>
    <li> According to the instruction booklet, this is a deviation from the company&#x27;s &amp;#34;Professional grade&amp;#34; lotion which glows a neon orange in the black light. This lotion glows white in the black light and is supposed to be more user friendly. Well user friendly doesn&#x27;t help much if it doesn&#x27;t work! As an RN, I purchased this to teach children about germs at Career Day. Unfortunately, I found the lotion to only glow with a fresh (as in still wet) application. I found that once it had time to absorb into the skin, it didn&#x27;t glow. Thankfully my subject had a dry skin patch which glowed or I would have looked like a complete idiot trying to find even a little something with the black light. And believe me I used a TON of this lotion for the demonstration. If I would have known, I would have searched a little harder for the &amp;#34;Professional grade&amp;#34; lotion that we used in nursing school and was very impressive in demonstrating germs. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a public health lesson for second graders.  It worked wonders. I have never seen so many kids washing their hands properly! Yay!  The mini black light worked well in the class room with the shades pulled.  I was a little concerned. I had plenty left over and it was a class of 25. :) Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Used when doing a hand washing presentation to a cub scout pack of 30 boys.  I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be enough gel, but it was plenty.  The flashlight is awful so be sure to buy another flashlight.  It was a hit with the boys as they really thought it was cool that they could see the \\&quot;germs\\&quot; on their hands and wrists.  Their uniforms were glowing on about half of them.</li>
    <li> It worked really well and was even shocking to college aged students. We used it in a huge lecture hall and had to use a large black light, but other than that the product was great!</li>
    <li> OMG, germs are everywhere, lol.. This stuff works!!!! Good size for kids to experiment with. Thank you, I loved it</li>
    <li> Excellent tool for a science fair project!</li>
    <li> Because is easy to use and it does it&#x27;s job, fast shipping.  My kid had an eigth grade project, worked out good.</li>
    <li> The germ lotion worked really well but the light was horrible. I would buy the kit again but i would buy a seperate back light.</li>
    <li> Great product for science fair experiment</li>
    <li> It works well for my sons science project. Affordable. Meet our expectations well and was easy to use. Fun to use.</li>
    <li> Used it on my son&#x60;s science project with success.  We use this product as a teaching tool for handwashing as part of infection control in my hospital.</li>
    <li> This was used for our recent elementary science fair project. It worked just great...just as advertised.  We were well pleased.</li>
    <li> Perfect and fast delivery!! My daughter used it for a science fair project to determine the effectiveness of hand washing versus antibacterial hand gel and wipes.  Her project was awesome, she did really well.</li>
    <li> The light is a little difficult to use.  Not easy taking photographs of the results.  The germ goo itself worked exactly as expected though.</li>
    <li> Great for a science lesson on microorganisms for sixth grade! We used this show what germs look like on your hands, they loved it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work,you can&#x27;t see the germs using the little light that comes with it,needs a bigger light for the project we were doing.....</li>
    <li> I bought this kit as a way to teach my kids in a fun way about germs. They loved trying it out. The mini black light that comes with the kit is useless and doesn&#x27;t really work but I had bought a bigger one anyhow at the same time because someone else had mentioned it in their review and I am glad I listened to that person.</li>
    <li> We used this product as part of a science fair and it was great!  My child loved the experiment and received great comments on the project.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product to imitate germs. My daughter used it for alcohol project to prove her theory in germs</li>
    <li> Students had SO much fun! They were very grossed out!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Easy to use.  The black light is fine if you make sure you are in the right light. Just enough to do my daughter&#x27;s science fair project with even some left over. Very happy with this kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 7 year old and her science project.  It is easy to use and gets the point across how germs really hide in every crack and cranny, so good hand washing is important.</li>
    <li> was great to help teach hand washing</li>
    <li> Glo Germ solution works well.  However, the key chain light is too small and weak to see bacteria (if any)</li>
    <li> This smaller size is easy to carry and the Glo Germ Gel is great but the light is a bit too small.</li>
    <li> We used this kit for my daughter&#x27;s science fair project on the importance of good hand washing practices. We purchased a larger black light because the one with the kit is hokey, but the product works just as describes and really helps give  a visual representation of germs on hands/services.</li>
    <li> I bought this to do a presentation on germs for a small group.  The tiny light was just too small you could not see the \\&quot;germs\\&quot; as well as you could with the bigger light.  For the little bit more it cost I would buy the bigger set.  Although if you have a black light the gel works just fine so 4 stars on that!</li>
    <li> Expensive for the fun</li>
    <li> I used this kit for a class project to show how germs stay on our hands before and after a hand washing.  My class LOVED the activity and learned alot from it.  The kit was well worth buying.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good for my son&#x27;s science project.&lt;br /&gt;He was pretty happy about it, and that makes it worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;Try it. i think you would like it too</li>
    <li> I used the kit to show children the importance of washing hands and proper technique.  This allowed them to visualize the germs that we encounter everyday.</li>
    <li> The Glo-germ lotion worked really well. The light does the job but it is somewhat dim. For the price though, its great.</li>
    <li> I used it to teach my students the value of good hand washing while we were learning about viruses and bacteria. Nice object lesson and eye opening to the students.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with this product. Came in earlier than expected. I&#x27;m using this product for hazemat Decon training it does the job but wished they sold a glow powder cheaper I&#x27;n an lager Bach. Overal great product</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t matter whether you washed your hands well or sloppily - your hands glowed the same - not much. Very disappointed in the product. Waste of money &amp; time.</li>
    <li> My six year old really wanted to participate in the science fair so we chose to use this Glogerm kit for her experiment. She loved seeing the &amp;#34;germs&amp;#34; on her hands under the black light. I wish the black light was a little bigger/brighter but overall a great kit!</li>
    <li> My son used this product for his science fair project and got a sweepstakes ribbon! It was awesome-he loved every minute of it.</li>
    <li> I used this for a hand washing demonstration and education with a college class and local children. The glow isn&#x27;t as pronounced as that of healthcare educational demonstrations but still very effective and noticeable under UV light.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Arrived quickly. I would recommend getting a larger black light flash light. Also the germ powder is great. Both products remind the family of better hand washing and not to touch your face in public. Lots of fun experiments to do with the gel and powder.</li>
    <li> Good kit for use in presenting a short presentation on hand hygiene.</li>
    <li> The black light could have been better.</li>
    <li> Used for kindergarten deminstration of proper hand washing. Went over like a charm. Very effective.</li>
    <li> The black light was missing from my package and, perhaps more disappointing, the bottle of gel and manual came in a dirty, used ziploc bag.  It is somewhat ironic that this product, of all things, would come in a used plastic bag that literally has smudges of food on and in it.  To be completely honest, it kind of undermines my confidence in the gel.</li>
    <li> Good size for traveling to schools to demonstrate handwashing. I ordered 3 of these so that we could work with more kids at a time.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this product to show the germs in her 6th grade science project. She won 2nd place for her grade! Awesome</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast however the LED light was not in the package. My niece needed this for a science project for school as was not able to complete it.</li>
    <li> Great!!! This demonstration was a part of my orientation to a new job at a hospital years ago, and what I learned from seeing it stuck in my mind. I got this to show my 4year old daughter a bit about germs and I blew her mind. So great for adults, professionals, children, anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> I had bought this for my Kindergarten class in lieu of the school science fair. We were going to investigate the best way to washout hands. So purchased this kit thinking the glo germ lotion would work... It barely show up under the light!! I tested the product, in my tight closed bathroom with no light entering. My family couldn&#x27;t even see the lotion and new I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take pictures of it.. I had to buy a $20 bottle of glo germ powder...which is highly effective... The lotion was dissatisfying.  I would give it 0 stars but the little black light worked great.</li>
    <li> We used this for a science fair project in my son&#x27;s second grade class. Worked really well for the kids to do!</li>
    <li> This worked as expected. My children were shocked that their &amp;#34;clean hands&amp;#34; washing technique wasn&#x27;t very effective. They had to relearn the skill and we had fewer colds this winter.</li>
    <li> When I was trying to come up with a fun science fair project I ran across the product.  You put the liquid on your hands and then wash.  When you think they&#x27;re clean you shine the black light over them.  And guess what?? You don&#x27;t clean your hands as well as you think, adults included! We did it at night so the black light would work the best.  We also had the kids put their hands on things like chairs, the refridgerater, the handle to flush the toilet and even the handle for the faucet.  They had a great time seeing all the &amp;#34;germs&amp;#34; they would be getting as well as leaving behind.  And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, they got rave reviews on their science fair project.  One year later and my kids are still singing the alphabet while washing their hands to make sure they are washing long enough to get the germs off.  Great little kit.</li>
    <li> Works great. Recommend getting the 6&amp;#34; blacklight as the keychain light is pretty small for teaching a class.</li>
    <li> Product worked well for the demonstration and teaching it was used for, but I did have to apply more of the lotion than what the directions said to get an effective glow.  The UV light is more than powerful enough to show the germs.  The nice compact size of the kit made it easy to use.</li>
    <li> big hit with my preschool class when we did a germ segment!  the little black light that comes with it is a bonus!  Definitely will use again next year!</li>
    <li> 1st grade science fair project was a hit. The kids loved the glow in the dark gel.</li>
    <li> I used this with my class for a science fair project and it was very effective.  They were amazed at what was left on their hands when the black light was revealed.</li>
    <li> This kit came exactly as described, with the instructions, a 2 oz bottle of Glo Germs, and a mini black light on a Key Chain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion went on easily and wasn&#x27;t very greasy.  The instructions were very clear.  I was impressed with how bright the light was, despite other reviews I read.  It worked well and wasn&#x27;t difficult to make out the germs at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were doing a unit on germs for school, so before lunchtime, as my oldest (8) was reading to my youngest (3), I told them I had some cool new lotion.  I made sure they couldn&#x27;t read the bottle as I dispensed some to them.  They rubbed it in really well, then went back to reading their books.  I proceeded to point out some fake mark on my 8 year-old&#x27;s face, so she went to the bathroom to check it out.  The 3 year-old followed along, climbing up on the stool and looking.  I told one of them to get the lights while the other brought the book in and closed the door.  I turned on the light and explained what I had done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both kids were shocked at where all the &amp;#34;germs&amp;#34; had transferred - all over the sink, faucet, light switch, wall, doorknob, door frame, their clothes, faces, the soap dispenser, and THE BOOK!  I told them if these were real germs, they&#x27;d spread in a similar fashion and it&#x27;s important to thoroughly wash hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the first time they washed, they did a poor job, although they thought they did a good job.  We checked out their hands and noted that in the process of washing, they had splashed &amp;#34;germs&amp;#34; all over their toothbrush and the wall.  When they dried their hands, they had transferred germs to the towel.  They also had these &amp;#34;germs&amp;#34; all under their nails.  Gross!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They rewashed, doing a better job, but then got more &amp;#34;germs&amp;#34; from the towel!!  They washed a third time, which was when my three year-old was almost losing her mind at how &amp;#34;gross&amp;#34; this was, and we made sure we washed under the black light so we knew wegot them all off, then dried with a fresh towel.  They were satisfied.  My three year-old started to open the door and I pointed out that she caught more &amp;#34;germs.&amp;#34;  She insisted on washing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a really cool experiment and showed how germs spread.  It got the point across not only to my 8 year-old, but to my 3 year-old.  We made a point to turn on the light and show that you couldn&#x27;t ordinarily see germs.  I also pointed out that these weren&#x27;t real germs, but simulated how real germs acted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that they&#x27;ve been washing better lately, and they had clean hands before eating lunch!!</li>
    <li> I used this product to teach a lesson about hygiene and hand washing practices to Kindergarten. It worked very well. The lotion showed up very clearly under the black light. I did use a bigger black light so that it was easier to see the whole hand, but the small black light worked just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> A fun way to teach children about cleaning their hands. The light is a little too small.</li>
    <li> We got it for a School project and it is a very good product and was on time and very cool to use!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Small light and ineffective light</li>
    <li> This mini Glo Germ kit was perfect for my daughter&#x27;s second grade science fair.  The amount in this kit was enough to use for experimenting and practicing the presentation as well as enough left over to do demonstrations a the Fair.  The mini UV light included works fine if you build a little dark box (we used a shoe box with black construction paper and holes in the lid) so kids can put their hands in the box and you can shine the light through one hole and use the other hole(s) to view the hand.</li>
