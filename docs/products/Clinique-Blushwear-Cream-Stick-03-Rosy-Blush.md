    <li> This is my new favorite blush. I&#x27;m very fair, and this gives a perfect rosy/warm complexion to my cheeks. It&#x27;s also simple to apply. A little dot on each cheek-apple, and blend. No breakouts or irritation.</li>
    <li> This is a cream blush that aplys just like you would put on a lipstick only is stays on longer. All you have to do is draw a line on your cheek bone and then blend in with your fingers. The blush does not wear off like power blushes and will stay on your skin until you remove your makeup. A great product if you do not want to constantly have to retouch you makeup. Not oily at all and comes off easy. well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Thought I would try this after many years of doing away with using blush, period. I never liked the application of using brushes because my skin is so sensitive. Love the application method of this product. The color is very subtle and natural looking. Blended easily and you have more control than would seem possible. Applying it in layers, you can intensify your color preference. Well worth the price as I believe this product will last a very long time for me.</li>
    <li> This is so nice- not heavy and kind of gives a dewy look.</li>
    <li> Have used this for a while and really like it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother and she really likes the color.  She has used Clinique for years and it is all she uses now.</li>
    <li> I have always used powder blush.  As my skin has started to age, though (I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s), I&#x27;ve noticed that anything powder really defines my pores and makes my skin look dull.  I was cautious about trying a cream blush.  I thought it was going to make me look like a clown.  I caved when I read a review on this Cream Stick in a magazine.  I LOVE LOVE  LOVE IT!  The color (according to the magazine) is universal and makes my skin look youthful and dewy.  It is incredibly easy to blend and feels light on my skin. Even my husband commented that he noticed a difference.  Seriously.  Buy it.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Nice color, a soft pinkish slightly peach color, not too much color and it only takes a tiny bit. I expect this will last a long time. Nice quality, great consistency, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this. It&#x27;s last all day long.</li>
    <li> I am 62 and have been looking for a cream blush that is most natural looking to my skin. I have always had a natural blush and this color from Clinique is an exact match! What luck! Never ordered makeup thru Amazon before but got my product in a timely manner and everything was better than expected.</li>
    <li> I love Clinique products!  So when I found a cream blusher that was convenient, I was sold.  This cream blusher in a stick is perfect for purse or travel!  It applies smoothly and blends naturally. For me, cream blusher lasts longer than powdered version and works better for my slightly dry skin.  Very impressed.  Great color selection.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Was not sure how I would like this product as I had never used it before, but I am pleasantly surprised.  Also too, the service was terrific.</li>
    <li> Very  satisfied......</li>

    <li> very good, spreads easily</li>
    <li> Lighter than appears in the photo but still beautiful on my light coloring. Clinique deserves the great name it has.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Color goes on evenly. Needs very little blending.  Creamy.  I have dry skin in the blush area, I like the feel of the creamy blush as apposed to powder blush. No accumulation of residual blush powder. Cleaner to use</li>
    <li> Perfect cheek color for me. It adds enough natural-looking color to make me look nit so vey fair. I&#x27;ve used this product for years and am happy with it.</li>
