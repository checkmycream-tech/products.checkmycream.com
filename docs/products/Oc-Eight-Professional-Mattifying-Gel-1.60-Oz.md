      <li>it is quite good otherwise.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many mattifying gels and lotions and this one is the best yet.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>

      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products on the market and this has worked the best out of all.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>i have to say i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for the last three years and it is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>It always leaves my face looking matte and flawless which I love especially since it&#x27;s so humid where we live!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Under makeup you should be fine, but if you run around barefaced as I do, use it sparingly and maybe be prepared to reapply periodically.</li>
      <li>This stuff is FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>Feels silky smooth when going on.</li>
      <li>This keeps me oil free all day and had changed my life.</li>
      <li>Even with an oil free foundation it did nothing to improve the appearance of my rosacea.</li>
      <li>It does have a slight oder but quickly disappears and my makeup is flawless till I remove it.</li>
      <li>Would have preferred the original brand.</li>
      <li>Thus, I was really excited after hearing about a product that could stop shine for up to 8 hours.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product which actually does reduce shine for hours, I can use liquid foundation again for the first time in years without  an over production of shine</li>
      <li>This  product really works better than any product I tried.  </li>
      <li>My foundation stays true all day.</li>
      <li>Apply a generous amount and let dry completely before you apply makeup for best results.</li>
      <li>Yeah, so it doesn&#x27;t last 8 whole hours, maybe 4 for me, but it&#x27;s so great</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
      <li>right now?&amp;#34</li>
      <li>This amazing elixir keeps me matte all day long, even in this humid Florida summer.</li>
      <li>, I get the occassional dry, and flaky patches but honestly it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
      <li>so next time I tried a bit more.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will order again, but only since something is better than nothing.</li>
      <li>Just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am on my 2nd tube of this product and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>We got married in August, I have oily skin</li>
      <li>It works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it also is not strong, so you really only smell it when you first apply.</li>
      <li>I must say I was VERY sketchy about buying this off of amazon because I didn&#x27;t know if it was a rip off or whatever, but I just went with it</li>
      <li>I have  very overactive&lt;br /&gt;oil glands and this has been my salcation.</li>
      <li>It only keeps me shine free for about 4 hours, but I will take it.</li>
      <li>It will block the oil production and really helps with a mat look to your makde up face.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll just stick to my oil absorbing wipes for now.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t&#x27; used it much, so the jury is still out.</li>
      <li>This product was referred by my dermatologist for my very oily T zone.  </li>
      <li>found that it really helped to even out my skin tone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell particularly nice but you can&#x27;t really notice that as you only need to use a small amount and it can easily be cover up with perfume or cologne.</li>
      <li>But if your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive like mine, this may be the answer for you!!!</li>
      <li>Next time I will try to offer the original one I had bought before</li>
      <li>Highly recommended - it really works.</li>
      <li>Normally my skin gets oily in a matter of 5 minutes, but with this stuff it really helps it.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>I only used a pea size amount for full face.</li>
      <li>Looks like I&#x27;ll be sticking with OC8, I highly recommend it to anyone with oily skin.</li>
      <li>I am 18, and I have very oily and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Once I wash my face, I normally start to see oil within 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product everyday for about a month now and although my skin isn&#x27;t as matte as I would like it, it is much better than not using this product at all.</li>
      <li>I had some pre-cancerous cells removed from my nose which resulted in a surface that was not only excessively oily but also a bit more colorful than my normal skin color.</li>
      <li>but it still gives you that natural shine, not like the slick and oily look but the nice natural skin look.</li>
      <li>what I can say is this stuff is very easy to apply and a little goes a very long way.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist suggested it and wow-</li>
      <li>It has a old smell to it.  </li>
      <li>It is the perfect base before foundation and keeps the shine at bay unlike anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>to apply&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t have to remove any of your current skin care routine steps, you just apply it right after your last step!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He has extremely oily skin (without much acne though), and has had trouble controlling it despite many products.</li>
      <li>It does work and it&#x27;s at least as good as other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but there is no other product that works as well.</li>
      <li>I used this underneath Makeup Forever Matte for our wedding, and barely had to touch up my makeup all night!</li>
      <li>I used just a bit the first time and it wasn&#x27;t visible and kept me completely dry but only for 3 or 4 hours,</li>
      <li>This product was okay, but not great.</li>
      <li>Also, I have tried other products and this does work better an anything else I have tried hands down!!</li>
      <li>The first day I used it, my fianc&amp;eacute; even complemented how much less shiny my skin was when he picked me up from work.</li>
      <li>In the summer I may need to pat the areas throughout the day but other than that, very please.  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes because I&#x27;ve tried just about everything in the past.</li>
      <li>I believe my oils may have been the cause of my acne because my acne has really simmered down since I have used this product</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, not the best I&#x27;ve tried. it does not seem to work over more than a couple hours. must reapply mid day.</li>
    <li> I almost considered taking Accutane just for oily skin, and OC8 was my last resort before going on to that. I must say I am very impressed. The first day I used it, my fianc&amp;eacute; even complemented how much less shiny my skin was when he picked me up from work. Looks like I&#x27;ll be sticking with OC8, I highly recommend it to anyone with oily skin. Don&#x27;t be alarmed with the small bottle, it looks like a little goes a long way. I only used a pea size amount for full face.</li>
    <li> I chose this item because after I put make up on, oil build up is almost non-existent..I mix some OC8 in with my liquid make-up and also I can use it by itself and put make-up over it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!  My dermatologist suggested it and wow- it&#x27;s total game changer.  No more shine. I wish I had found it years ago!  My face is NEVER greasy anymore!  YAY!</li>
    <li> Use this product on your face just before you apply your foundation and after your moisturizer. It will block the oil production and really helps with a mat look to your makde up face.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin. This definitely helps but does not work all day. Just a few hours. I will purchase it again though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC. I walked across Manhattan with a coworker a few weeks ago in the sweltering heat and she looked at me mid sentence and said &amp;#34;how do you look flawless right now?&amp;#34; This gel is a must have.</li>
    <li> This gel has an awful smell to it and does not mattify my face. I expected it to control oil and shine but it does not. It&#x27;s expensive and not worth the price. I gave it a try for over a week and it does not do what it promises. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> The best stuff out there</li>
    <li> The product is effective for the most part. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it also is not strong, so you really only smell it when you first apply. Has a slight chemical smell.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily African American skin. Once I wash my face, I normally start to see oil within 30 minutes.This  product really works better than any product I tried.  It only keeps me shine free for about 4 hours, but I will take it. I wear it under a matt foundation.</li>
    <li> I see a difference when I use Oc 8, only thing is when I apply it in the morning it tends to make me perspire...</li>
    <li> This stuff...is liquid gold. I have tried every primer out there to combat my oily skin, every matte foundation as well. My dermatologist recommended this and I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes because I&#x27;ve tried just about everything in the past. All the high end expensive ones never helped a bit. This amazing elixir keeps me matte all day long, even in this humid Florida summer. In the past, my makeup was melting off in an hour and I slightly resembled an oil slick. Never again. This will be a part of my beauty arsenal till the day I die. It does have a slight oder but quickly disappears and my makeup is flawless till I remove it. So happy I&#x27;ve found this stuff!!</li>
    <li> It does work and it&#x27;s at least as good as other products I&#x27;ve tried. There&#x27;s no oil in it unlike some creams (I&#x27;m looking at you, MAC oil control lotion), so it goes on dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the rub. I&#x27;m quite brown and it is definitely visible on my skin, even after hours. I used just a bit the first time and it wasn&#x27;t visible and kept me completely dry but only for 3 or 4 hours, so next time I tried a bit more. I didn&#x27;t see it initially (different lighting, perhaps?), but under the harsher lights at work there was a definite ghostly hue on my forehead. Just something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under makeup you should be fine, but if you run around barefaced as I do, use it sparingly and maybe be prepared to reapply periodically. Don&#x27;t go all geisha all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is quite good otherwise. Zero sheen while it lasts.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I think it helps keep my face from getting so oily when used as a base under my foundation. I used this underneath Makeup Forever Matte for our wedding, and barely had to touch up my makeup all night! We got married in August, I have oily skin and we were dancing for hours, so that is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This product was okay, but not great. Even with an oil free foundation it did nothing to improve the appearance of my rosacea. Despite applying it on my lower eyelids, my WATERPROOF mascara was smudging by mid-morning. I will order again, but only since something is better than nothing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product everyday for about a month now and although my skin isn&#x27;t as matte as I would like it, it is much better than not using this product at all. Also, I have tried other products and this does work better an anything else I have tried hands down!!</li>
    <li> Great product which actually does reduce shine for hours, I can use liquid foundation again for the first time in years without  an over production of shine Yay thank you OC8</li>
    <li> It worked great for keeping my skin from appearing oily. My problem was it broke me out!!!&lt;br /&gt;Guess I&#x27;ll go back to oily skin! But if your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive like mine, this may be the answer for you!!!</li>
    <li> This product was referred by my dermatologist for my very oily T zone.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products on the market and this has worked the best out of all.  In the summer I may need to pat the areas throughout the day but other than that, very please.  I usually put a coat on and after 10 minutes apply another thin coat.  If you put it on too thick or unevenly, it will dry and leave white spots/lines. Have been using this for past 6 years.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  It always leaves my face looking matte and flawless which I love especially since it&#x27;s so humid where we live!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! My make-up stays on all day. It is a primer &amp; goes on after moisturizer &amp; before make-up. Feels silky smooth when going on.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Not only does it give your face the matte look it also helps keep your face from being oily as well.</li>
    <li> Would have preferred the original brand. Next time I will try to offer the original one I had bought before</li>
    <li> Have used this product for quite a while now and it is excellent. I shave my head and use it to reduce the shine.  I apply it once in the morning and do not have to reapply all day.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this. I don&#x27;t know how I could survive without it. I have extremely oily skin. When I apply this under my make up, I don&#x27;t have to powder my nose for at least 3 hours. It&#x27;s pricey, but there is no other product that works as well.</li>
    <li> The best oil control product I&#x27;ve found. Controls oil throughout day. Doesn&#x27;t smell. Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin, just controls oil. Best price is on amazon.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many mattifying gels and lotions and this one is the best yet.  My foundation stays true all day.</li>
    <li> I have extremely greasy skin. I&#x27;ve been on several accutane treatments, but the oil always came back after I was taken off of the accutane treatment. Thus, I was really excited after hearing about a product that could stop shine for up to 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But OC8 didn&#x27;t work for me. After about 2 hours, I get shiny again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just stick to my oil absorbing wipes for now. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than OC8 anyhow...</li>
    <li> This keeps me oil free all day and had changed my life. I&#x27;m extremely oily and this is the only thing that&#x27;s ever worked. Apply a generous amount and let dry completely before you apply makeup for best results.</li>
    <li> Blocks oil like it says. Can be a bit drying depending on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried for extreme shine, recommended by my dermatologist. Yeah, so it doesn&#x27;t last 8 whole hours, maybe 4 for me, but it&#x27;s so great, it&#x27;s so worth it. I don&#x27;t even have to wear make- up anymore. Plus, a big plus is that it doesn&#x27;t make me break out! I have super sensitive skin. I get a zit just thinking about it. Not with this stuff! I keep some at home, in my car, in my purse...</li>
    <li> This stuff will cover up shine and absorb oil for 6-8 hours at a time.  It&#x27;s a godsend for those of us who previously walked around looking like we just got done running five miles !  Highly recommended - it really works.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all. 30 minutes after putting it on, my skin was just as oily as usual.</li>
    <li> The product was not what it was suppose to be. It has a old smell to it.  There was no date on the bottle so I&#x27;m not sure but I have used this before and it didn&#x27;t smell like that.  It also broke my face out really bad which it has never done before. So I&#x27;m not sure if what was in the bottle was actually what it was suppose to be.  It was a waste of money. I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> I am 18, and I have very oily and sensitive skin. A lot of things tend to break me out. I never thought about purchasing a mattifying gel until I saw a girl on YouTube raving about this OC8 product. So, I went online and of course Amazon had it for the best price. I must say I was VERY sketchy about buying this off of amazon because I didn&#x27;t know if it was a rip off or whatever, but I just went with it and I must say I am SO HAPPY I did.&lt;br /&gt; I love this product. I tend to not wear foundation or anything anymore so I can&#x27;t say what it does for makeup staying power, but what I can say is this stuff is very easy to apply and a little goes a very long way. Normally my skin gets oily in a matter of 5 minutes, but with this stuff it really helps it.&lt;br /&gt; Now, this product does make your skin matte but it still gives you that natural shine, not like the slick and oily look but the nice natural skin look. It will definitely dry out the skin, I get the occassional dry, and flaky patches but honestly it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. All in all, I personally love this product and reccomend any one to try it out. I believe my oils may have been the cause of my acne because my acne has really simmered down since I have used this product and I feel confident in my own skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It does mattify the skin&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t have to remove any of your current skin care routine steps, you just apply it right after your last step!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Tends to be a bit drying, can cause dry, flakey patches.&lt;br /&gt;-Has a scent. (but it is hardly noticable and goes away very quickly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current skin care routine is:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash face with a warm wash cloth&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply Clindamycin Phosphate&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply Rugby Acne Medication Benzoyl Peroxide gel&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply Neutrogena Dry-Touch Sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply OC 8 mattifying gel</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd tube of this product and absolutely love it. It is the perfect base before foundation and keeps the shine at bay unlike anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
    <li> It works great at eliminating shine for about 4 hrs. The only thing I have found that works this well.</li>
    <li> I had some pre-cancerous cells removed from my nose which resulted in a surface that was not only excessively oily but also a bit more colorful than my normal skin color. I spoke with the PA at the dermatologist&#x27;s office where I periodically go for check ups for skin cancer, and she gave me a sample of OC Eight. The result was that I did not have to go out with a rosy nose.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well. I have oily skin, and it keeps my skin oil-free for about 8 hours. I still prefer DermaDoctor&#x27;s T-Zone mattifying gel, but they don&#x27;t sell that anymore.</li>
    <li> wouldnt think of going without this!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband at the recommendation of his dermatologist. He has extremely oily skin (without much acne though), and has had trouble controlling it despite many products. He says this definitely controls his shine for about 5 hours, when usually it was less than 1 hr without any product after washing his face. Make sure you rub it in very thin otherwise it can leave a white residue on your skin.</li>
    <li> The package is different and the shape of the tube is different and the ingredients are a little different so i didn&#x27;t know what to expect but it turned out it works as well as what i had, so i have to say i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last three years and it is wonderful.  It stays on the entire day and if you have oily skin it does not come through your makeup.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it really helped to even out my skin tone. I also have oily skin and it helped with that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell particularly nice but you can&#x27;t really notice that as you only need to use a small amount and it can easily be cover up with perfume or cologne.</li>
    <li> Product seems to work well...I haven&#x27;t&#x27; used it much, so the jury is still out.</li>
    <li> I love,love  this matt Gel does what it states. Idon&#x27;thave to be drying up the oil from my face.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended it. I have  very overactive&lt;br /&gt;oil glands and this has been my salcation.</li>
