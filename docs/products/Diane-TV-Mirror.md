### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect mirror for my bath.</li>
      <li>Perfect sized mirror!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the best mirror I&#x27;ve ever had, but for the price it&#x27;s a great bargain.  </li>
      <li>Good luck putting this ANYWHERE where it&#x27;s not going to fall off!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
      <li>Apart from that it&#x27;s a great item.</li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GOOD SIZE GLASS MIRRO.</li>
      <li>Good price, too.</li>
      <li>They are good, glass mirrors...</li>
      <li>Good mirror -- good size, light weight.</li>
      <li>All I need is a mirror with which to check out the back of my hair, and this does the job perfectly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly my carelessness that has been the problem...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a barber who also cuts my own hair and with the size of this mirror everything runs smoothly.</li>
      <li>You know what I love?</li>
      <li>This product is very useful!</li>
      <li>Mirror is a bit wobbly inside the cheap plastic frame, but ok.</li>
      <li>This mirror works as advertised reflecting images in all the wavelengths of light that I am able to perceive.</li>
      <li>This mirror is huge.</li>
      <li>broke instantly...extremely cheap</li>
      <li>Defiantly feels flimsy and cheap but does the job.</li>
      <li>but it was just not cutting it, so I needed something bigger and this mirror seemed just like the thing that I needed and the price was something that I was happy to fork over.</li>
      <li>Nothing special about this mirror.</li>
      <li>This mirror is big, and seems to be a good deal for the money.</li>
      <li>I like the size of this very much.</li>
      <li>This mirror does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m not upset with the mirror, I would gladly pay $3-5 for it.....</li>
      <li>but anything over that is just too much for the flimsy construction.  </li>
      <li>Cheap product overall.</li>
      <li>Shipped extremely fast</li>
      <li>The handle is very flimsy and bends under the weight of the mirrored glass.  </li>
      <li>I really want to know what engineer decided &amp;</li>
      <li>Glass did not fit plastic and slides around in the frame, handle isn&#x27;t sturdy and seems like it will snap very easily.  </li>
      <li>but they really should make them a little more sturdy.  </li>
      <li>I can hold it with my left hand as I style my hair with my right hand.  </li>
      <li>I live it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I could find a comparable item at a local store for less money if I really wanted to search...</li>
      <li>Large, wide mirror that lets you cut the hair on the back of your head, small enough that you can carry it around and admire yourself in public places, and also lets you look into your neighbors&#x27; houses to plan that perfect burglary!  </li>
      <li>and I suspect it won&#x27;t last long, but it was cheap and is just a temporary fix.</li>
      <li>And the whole thing is totally off-balance.  </li>
      <li>This is a decent mirror for the price that I got for the purpose of checking the back of my head while I trim it.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and was wrapped in a few layers of plastic bubble wrap to protect it.  </li>
      <li>Mirror is not as sturdy/ heavy as similar hand held units I have had, thus will have to be handled very gently</li>

    <li> Mirror is not as sturdy/ heavy as similar hand held units I have had, thus will have to be handled very gently</li>
    <li> It  was a gift to someone. They like it.</li>
    <li> I paid $13 for a mirror whose quality is that of a dollar store mirror. The handle is very flimsy and bends under the weight of the mirrored glass.  Overall I&#x27;m not upset with the mirror, I would gladly pay $3-5 for it.....but anything over that is just too much for the flimsy construction.  The glass does rattle slightly,  but the larger issue is the constant bending at the handle as you move it around.</li>
    <li> i give three stars because the mirror was a bit loose when I got it. i hated the fact that it was wobbly.</li>
    <li> Mirror is a bit wobbly inside the cheap plastic frame, but ok.</li>
    <li> I like the size of this very much. Good price, too.</li>
    <li> This mirror is big, and seems to be a good deal for the money. I have had no problems with this mirror to date.</li>
    <li> This product is very useful!</li>
    <li> I been through several of this style of mirror.  They are good, glass mirrors...the frames are just a little flimsy.  It&#x27;s mostly my carelessness that has been the problem...but they really should make them a little more sturdy.  I&#x27;m sure I could find a comparable item at a local store for less money if I really wanted to search...but I don&#x27;t want to waste the fuel.</li>
    <li> Large, wide mirror that lets you cut the hair on the back of your head, small enough that you can carry it around and admire yourself in public places, and also lets you look into your neighbors&#x27; houses to plan that perfect burglary!  After five months I managed to break it while moving into my apartment. No worries, though; I fixed it with a thin strip of duct tape!</li>
    <li> Good mirror -- good size, light weight. A little pastic-y.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GOOD SIZE GLASS MIRRO. THE HANDLE FEELS A LITTLE WEAK, BUT FOR THE PRICE I WOUD BUY IT AGAIN IF I EVER NEED A NOTHER ONE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO MY FRIENDS.....</li>
    <li> Mirror was Loose and wobbly inside its frame</li>
    <li> Great price. I hang it on my cubicle wall to see who is walking up behind me.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I expected!</li>
    <li> Got a returned item. The original box had a beaten up look, hairs left the mirror, frame is detached and broken. The mirror is not even wrapped inside its bag.</li>
    <li> Mirror rattles around in the housing, doesn&#x27;t feel like it will last very long. Would not order again.</li>
    <li> Perfect mirror for my bath. The previous one fell off its hook and shattered into a bazillion pices. This one might do the same one day. Meanwhile, we can see the backs of our heads again.</li>
    <li> This mirror works as advertised reflecting images in all the wavelengths of light that I am able to perceive.</li>
    <li> This is a decent mirror for the price that I got for the purpose of checking the back of my head while I trim it. I had a small hand mirror but it was just not cutting it, so I needed something bigger and this mirror seemed just like the thing that I needed and the price was something that I was happy to fork over. It solved the issue that I had and the the only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this mirror is that the glass wobbles a bit inside the plastic frame and it bother&#x27;s me a bit, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the mirror&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> Pretty poor quality frame, arrive cracked in two places but has yet to break completely still after a few months. Defiantly feels flimsy and cheap but does the job.</li>
    <li> You know what I love? Broken glass all over my bathroom floor.  Especially when it gets in my foot and I have to spend half an hour with a pair of tweezers trying to pluck out all the pieces.  The glass in this mirror IS NOT GLUED TO THE BACK! I really want to know what engineer decided &amp;#34;you know what, it would cost an extra $0.22 to put a dab of epoxy glue on the back of this glass but...nah.&amp;#34;  Genius, genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the mirror is not glued to the plastic would not be so bad if it actually fit.  But of course it doesn&#x27;t.  It slides around.  And the whole thing is totally off-balance.  Good luck putting this ANYWHERE where it&#x27;s not going to fall off! In my case, the glass slid out and broke in my sink, sending broken glass all over the floor.  Just as I was trying to shave my neckline, of course.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best mirror I&#x27;ve ever had, but for the price it&#x27;s a great bargain.  All I need is a mirror with which to check out the back of my hair, and this does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> Eh, another case of getting what you pay for.  The mirror is very loose in the plastic and I suspect it won&#x27;t last long, but it was cheap and is just a temporary fix.</li>
    <li> broke instantly...extremely cheap</li>
    <li> Perfect sized mirror! Shipped extremely fast I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> This mirror does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  I bought it to use when I&#x27;m styling my hair, so that I can see the back of my head in my bathroom mirror.  I like how lightweight it is -- I can hold it with my left hand as I style my hair with my right hand.  It arrived quickly and was wrapped in a few layers of plastic bubble wrap to protect it.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Glass did not fit plastic and slides around in the frame, handle isn&#x27;t sturdy and seems like it will snap very easily.  Cheap product overall.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this mirror.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Big enough for my clumsy hands</li>
    <li> Mirror is flimsy, floppy, had to be returned, due to crack in glass.  Plastic does not support it, is way too thin.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> This mirror is huge. I live it. I&#x27;m a barber who also cuts my own hair and with the size of this mirror everything runs smoothly. I&#x27;d recommend it. The only problem with this mirror is the mirror it self is shaky. Apart from that it&#x27;s a great item.</li>
