    <li> Absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I mix this with my Kanechom and then apply to my hair and I tell you your hair will just be so silky and beautiful and smell so good for until your next wash and condition.</li>
    <li> Product works good as expected but in my opinion it smells horrible, will most likely give it away because I personally can&#x27;t take it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff ... Help a lot on damaged hair .... Get it!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure about this...</li>
    <li> I love the original silicon mix, so I gave this version of it a try. I have natural curly hair and I also have some heat damage. I used this and I saw a difference immediately. My hair was moisturized and it really helped some of my texture return. This is my staple conditioner now. It gives a great slip when detangling and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair coated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many people talk about it and when I tried it it was just ok for my hair. Not very good at all</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used. My hair is soft, frizz-free, and the scent is great! My daughter, who is prone to developing &amp;#34;dreadlocks&amp;#34; in her pretty blond hair, has not had any issues since she started using this product. We are customers forever!</li>
    <li> really like this conditioner!  Silicon Mix is awesome. The original is still better I think, but the bambu has silica, and that is important for hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have been using Shea Moisture, more several months now.  But my hair needs silicones, this is what was missing.  I am in love!  Now, I am purchasing more of the products from the Dominican Republic!  They know ethnic hair.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to order this product at first, but once I received it and use it for the very first time I was just amazed at the results. I can&#x27;t believe I went all this years fighting with my hair in order to make it look and feel the way this product had made my hair feel and look. I will recommend it to anyone. Great move and great choice.</li>
    <li> I have ordered a bambu one but it was deliveried a regular one. So disapointed because the one delivered has a really bad smell.</li>
    <li> I am so happy i fly to the DR often and found this product on AMAZON. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love everything about it, leaves hair bouncy &amp; shiny</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have been using it for several years and it works great thank you very much.</li>
    <li> huge container can last you over a year. Provides good protection for your hair if you want it stronger. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again though.</li>
    <li> It is perfect to my hair. I bought more to send to my family, they loved... I will buy more for sure.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time yesterday . It smells great. My hair has a lot of body . I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!!!!  Upon reading recommendations, I mixed this with Kanechome and was very pleased with the results.  My hair was so shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I bought this because its ecomic and smells great and makes my hair shine. I started noticing that my hair is fuller and and their is a significant reduction in breakage when i detangle my hair. I am spanish and i have to relax my hair so i recomend this to anyone with curly,corse, or relaxed hair if you are looking for help in the detangling department. Plus since ive started using it people keep telking me my hair has grown alot.  I detangle then leave in in my hair for a bit with a shower cap on  before i rinse it</li>
    <li> I have used the other Silicon mix in the past and have always loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I had never tried the Silcon Mix Bambu before, and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;To me there are only two specific diffrences between this one &amp; the regular:  The color and the scent.&lt;br /&gt;This smells really nice and I have used it on my hair &amp; my daughters hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great deep conditioner...this it it!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used the product the first day &amp; I saw an improvement in my hair immediately. I would recommend this product to anyone suffering from damage or breakage. I&#x27;m AA &amp; have a relaxer.</li>
    <li> like all other reviews said - it is the best.&lt;br /&gt;some additional points : it cuts your drying time in half. i dont know why, but hair dries much faster after using this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;also - do not freak out about silicones. silicones are neither good nor bad. they just coat your hair, so it becomes slippery-smooth, and healthy looking. not healthy, just healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;the good? slippery smooth hair doesnt break as much, so you are saving your locks.&lt;br /&gt;the bad? yes it builds up - so go buy yourself some baking soda to add to your shampoo. or buy clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;news flash - if you hair had been chemically treated, it will never be healthy again. but it can be very healthy looking if you look after it right. and this conditioner does just that.</li>
    <li> I am a hair care junky. I have tried so many products over the years and I must say I love love this conditioner.  I dont use it with any other conditioner like some reviewers suggest. I did order the Kanechom Ultimate Chocolate Moisturizing and Conditioning Hair Treatment but I use each product on its own.  I have naturally curly hair. I dont know what number my hair texture is but I am Asian and Black so I have thick long spirly curls not waves.  This conditioner I use weekly only. It makes my hair really soft and easy to comb through when wet. The smell is okay. Its a little strong, not fresh scent, kinda like hair salon product smell but its not like its on your hair for hours. The way it makes your hair look and feel will make you get over the smell.  This really helps with breakage and dryness as well.  It really is a great conditioner for weekly use.</li>
    <li> Great for restoring dried tried human hair wigs.</li>
    <li> it is my number 1 conditioner ever , each week I keep it for 2-3 hours under plastic cap for deep hydration after week of using heaters and other stuff, it return my hair back to normal..&lt;br /&gt;not need anything else , make sure you rinse well couple of time to avoid heavy build up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is not recommended for oily hair , it is good for all types of hair that are really dry and freeze , it create build up to help the hair from drying but it allow me to keep my hair looking nice for a week .&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes in summer I miz just a little bit with water and I spray on my hair before going to the beach, it protect my hair from the sun and sea water and salt , after I wash off it after the day on the beach the hair are silky and smooth ready for styling and stay up all week long , the smell is intensive but it get out fast , the first day it bother me as well but i love this product more so have no choice</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair soft and shiny, whether I use it as a mask or as a rinse out conditioner.  A friend recommended this and I love it!  My hair is very dry and this really helps to moisturize it.  I have replaced all my other conditioners with this now.  I cannot recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay! I like the original better. It does cut down on the drying time.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair, and when I use this conditioner it makes my hair so silky. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Even if you don&#x27;t buy the rest of the system, buy this Nutritive Treatment. My hair got very dry and frizzy - probably over-processed - and this was a perfect cure. You can use it like regular conditioners - 3 minutes, then rinse - or leave it on for 15 minutes for the cure-all effect. I was amazed. You won&#x27;t wand to use anything else ever again! Whether you use it regularly or for periodic treatments, just use it.</li>
