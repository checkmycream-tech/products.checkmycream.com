      <li>neutrogena all in 1 acene control is the best product for my skin, my problem and has a solution, it helps when the skin is red or when my foot is swollen ... looks better without acne since the use ..</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily, in fact it absorbs most of the oil.  </li>
      <li>I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I thought surely there were more people who were as impressed as I was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since it has salacylic acid, it&#x27;s great for keeping acne medicine on your face for the whole day.</li>

      <li>It was a good size and works very well.</li>
      <li>Easy.</li>
      <li>The size is easy to travel with as well.</li>
      <li>Ever since I bought it, I haven&#x27;t got any huge pimple again on my face.</li>
      <li>Well worth it and more.</li>
      <li>I genuinely thought I had started outgrowing acne.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Put a light layer on my face at night.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for about 2 years, and I feel that when I use it with the All in One acne face wash that is goes with, I get fantastic results.</li>
      <li>this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap though.</li>
      <li>Well worth it and more.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel smooth .</li>
      <li>The old 2% solution was much more effective.  </li>
      <li>Skin feels clean and light weight all day.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, I have tried many different acne products including proactive, clean and clear, and nother neutrogena products and this is the best yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not painful and</li>
      <li>It is good for long term acne solution and it made my skin smooth after about 2 week of applying it  </li>
      <li>Because my main concern was the face lotion I purchased, the Neutrogena all in one was more of a safeguard in case the lotion was too oily and made me break out.</li>
      <li>Very pleased. :-)sly optimal results in a few weeks.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not harsh at all, it feels very light on the skin.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different acne curing products,this works.</li>
      <li>Now my face has become smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>it also does a phenomenal job at prevention, and if you do get a pimple its tiny.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s around the time I got online and saw that it had been doing more than I knew and started back up</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more</li>
      <li>I usually wash my face, put on this treatment, then put on my Clinique acne solutions moisturizer over top, although this treatment would probably work as a moisturizer by itself for most people.</li>
      <li>New product, it&#x27;s far better than Neutrogena&#x27;s fight n fade gel.</li>
      <li>The regular price isn&#x27;t my favorite, but using it on my entire face once a day every day, it will still probably last me a good 3 months.</li>
      <li>The regular price isn&#x27;t my favorite, but using it on my entire face once a day every day, it will still probably last me a good 3 months.</li>
      <li>I have so many old AND new acne scars, but this stuff really takes the cake.</li>
      <li>now so acne is rare compared to when I struggled in my teens to keep a pimple free face daily</li>
      <li>This seemed OK at first, but then I had a huge breakout over my entire face a week after starting using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>but if you want something to zap those zits away fast I would look for a more fast acting treatment</li>
      <li>great product for acne and dark spots at the same time!</li>
      <li>Like it for pimples that pop up around  certain times of the month.</li>
      <li>Along with the partnering scrub, keeps my face relatively blemish free and does not cause redness or dryness.</li>
      <li>and it makes my skin really oily.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Very upsetting.  </li>
      <li>*, and I&#x27;m in my 30s and don&#x27;t have much acne</li>
      <li>it really doesnt help my acne that much</li>
      <li>I have problem skin and this has really done wonders for  it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know much about skin care treatment before</li>
      <li>My daughter uses this product and she finds it really controls her acne.</li>
      <li>It works well just dont put too much</li>
      <li>I love this product, it definitely helps clear blemishes and makes your skin look radiant.</li>
      <li>Bought it on amazon after running low on my original tube, paid $11.99 on amazon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My go to acne treatment. I&#x27;m in my mid-20s now so acne is rare compared to when I struggled in my teens to keep a pimple free face daily so I can&#x27;t tell if my face is more resistant to acne or if this cream is awesome. I think the cream is awesome as it does reduce redness and the swolleness of pimples after one application during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does nothing for black heads though. So use for white heads, up-and-coming pimples, or just red skin protrusions that will soon turn to pimples.</li>
    <li> love this product.  I have problem skin and this has really done wonders for  it. I have used it for over 2 months.</li>
    <li> Used product before. Like it for pimples that pop up around  certain times of the month. Very effective for quick remedy.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working like stated</li>
    <li> great for my teenager</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products with salicylic acid in it that I can use under my makeup.  Other products cause my make up to &#x27;pill up&#x27; if I put it on underneath.  It&#x27;s a lightweight product so it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy under make up.  And not super strong so I have no problem using it 5 out of 7 days a week.  It seems to prevent new pimples and helps the scarring from my previous breakouts.  (I have cystic acne that leaves horrible scars.)  Great product!</li>
    <li> Like any medicine with salicylic acid, you put it one and it helps dry it out much faster, sometimes even overnight.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time user, but i like it. (I have combination skin) Doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy like most products. I use it in combination with the Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System. Better than Proactive (imo)&lt;br /&gt;Wash my face with the Acne System using all 3 steps then use the Acne Control Treatment as a moisturizer. Skin feels clean and light weight all day.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
    <li> It works against my face. I hate it.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve found a winner. Seems to be effective and easy to use.</li>
    <li> great product for acne and dark spots at the same time!</li>
    <li> Not at all what I had expected. Didn&#x27;t quite work for me.</li>
    <li> When I got online to see the rating of this product after using it, I was shocked that it wasn&#x27;t at least 4 1/2 stars. I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I thought surely there were more people who were as impressed as I was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased this product more or less on a whim. Interestingly enough, CVS had discontinued their version of a Neutrogena brand lotion I really liked (The CVS name was healthy complexion, clear skin, anti wrinkle moisturizer acne treatment cream),and out of anger, I refused to purchase the Neutrogena name brand because it was around $6-7 more. So I was on the hunt for something affordable I hadn&#x27;t tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This little gem was on (what I now realize to be) an unbelievable sale for $3. So I purchased this treatment and a lotion for still under the price of the Neutrogena lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Because my main concern was the face lotion I purchased, the Neutrogena all in one was more of a safeguard in case the lotion was too oily and made me break out. So I didn&#x27;t really invest as far as what it was supposed to do or even really how to use it. I thought, &#x27;Acne cream. Put a light layer on my face at night. Boom.&#x27; So I start casually using it (I use it instead of lotion after washing my face at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Within a few weeks, I thought my skin was getting so clear I started slacking off. I genuinely thought I had started outgrowing acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Then of course, a few weeks later I&#x27;m like wait, where&#x27;s my glowing radiant skin? Where&#x27;s my smoothness? My face was getting blotchy and unsightly again. What had I done wrong?!?! I then remembered I hadn&#x27;t been using this treatment regularly. That&#x27;s around the time I got online and saw that it had been doing more than I knew and started back up right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This stuff is a lifesaver! I have oily skin and giant pores. I really can barely wear makeup without breaking out. This stuff worked so well I thought I had new skin! Overnight difference, but obviously optimal results in a few weeks. The regular price isn&#x27;t my favorite, but using it on my entire face once a day every day, it will still probably last me a good 3 months. Well worth it and more. Very pleased. :-)sly optimal results in a few weeks. The regular price isn&#x27;t my favorite, but using it on my entire face once a day every day, it will still probably last me a good 3 months. Well worth it and more. Very pleased. :-)</li>
    <li> This cream has a pleasant smell, and absorbs into the skin quickly.  It has salicylic acid that tames skin bacteria, inflammation and itchiness.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff! Bought it on amazon after running low on my original tube, paid $11.99 on amazon. Funny story: went to Marshalls the day after the product arrived and they were selling them for $5.50, I bought ALL the boxes they had, only a couple, because that it how much I love this stuff! I put it on in the morning before work and sometimes at night before bed. Warning, b/c of the acid in here it kinda sorta bleached my gray pillow cases and sheet, but if you have white sheets than no worries! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all either</li>
    <li> This product works miracles!!! I usually have a very clean face, but sometimes I do get pimples.  When I feel a big one is coming, I just put a very small amount of this product and the next day it is gone!!! Ever since I bought it, I haven&#x27;t got any huge pimple again on my face.</li>
    <li> Excellent everything was in a good time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I was having horrible breakouts on my chin area.  This cream has not only removed my acne but also the scars from my previous acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my breakouts for the last 6 weeks or so. It seems to minimize my pimples and reduce the size and redness of them so that they go away sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say that it prevents breakouts or that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; treatment, but it does seem to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too drying either.</li>
    <li> New product, it&#x27;s far better than Neutrogena&#x27;s fight n fade gel. I saw results in around 2 weeks. It doesn&#x27;t dry you out, it&#x27;s not harsh at all, it feels very light on the skin. For people who want a solid acne mark fading product, try this one out.</li>
    <li> It works well on my acnes. I like it.</li>
    <li> my son loves this product... shipped fast but separately which was kinda weird... more expensive than the last. 4 I bought directly from neutrogena site...</li>
    <li> This product leaves my face sticky, does not clear up any pimples. I still have the same pimples for almost 2 months!! It causes me even more breakout. Wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> I have so many old AND new acne scars, but this stuff really takes the cake. It has cleared up in the past two months of me using it my acne, and is fading my old and new scars caused from acne. It doesn&#x27;t cause a dry feeling, and makes my skin feel silky smooth. 5/5</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel of any improvement with it</li>
    <li> This product works to drastically fade hyperpigmentation mark and reduces the presence of acne within 2-3 months. I am impressed and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Apparently I am allergic to salicylic acid and it made my acne worse. I was using it as a spot treatment, but I got terrible acne from it. Still struggling. I didn&#x27;t know much about skin care treatment before so I splattered it all over my face, terrible mistake, so be careful when using it and patch test first!</li>
    <li> Great product!!  I have very  sensitive and oily skin with a few blemishes, and can only use cetaphil or sensitive dove soap to wash my face.  This product doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily, in fact it absorbs most of the oil.  I was bummed when I found out that Neutrogena discontinued the product, I purchased 2 to last me.</li>
    <li> Milder action than expected, and starts showing effect after about a week of daily usage. The acne does come back though if you stop applying it.</li>
    <li> Great cream. It actually does everything promised by the ad: helps remove acne and completely &amp;#34;deletes&amp;#34; old red acne scars. I just bought several tubes again.</li>
    <li> I have yet to see any changes but I am still using it. It does smell great and sometimes seem to work.</li>
    <li> I have noticed less breakouts since I started using this</li>
    <li> This product cleared the pimples on my face within one week of usage. Now my face has become smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but I think the formula needs to be stronger.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it definitely helps clear blemishes and makes your skin look radiant. I will definitely buy more</li>
    <li> Works ok i still have break out but when i do not as bad as they were when i wasnt using this product. I will try using it longer to see if it improves.</li>
    <li> Can  not find this product in the stores anymore, very good for all skin types and effective on treating problem skin</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different acne curing products,this works.</li>
    <li> quite effective for pimples</li>
    <li> I used all it. It&#x27;s just work 40% for me 😟</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for years and will try anything. This product seems to help when used along with a full line of other acne fighting products such as face wash, toner and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Although my acne is somewhat under control, this does not reduce the look of dark spots as I had expected.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Along with the partnering scrub, keeps my face relatively blemish free and does not cause redness or dryness.</li>
    <li> this product is very thick and as soon as applied skin becomes extremely dry and my skin started peeling the next day</li>
    <li> this stuff clears everything up and doesnt dry out your skin.  it also does a phenomenal job at prevention, and if you do get a pimple its tiny.  i</li>
    <li> When I found out how less expensive this on Amazon than in the stores I nearly hit the floor!!! My almost 40 yr old acne marked and acne prone skin is healing and the treatment is preventing further break-outs!!!!  A total MUST for anyone who had past marks, present acne, or who doesn&#x27;t want any in the first place! I wear it night and day under my makeup and you would never know it was on!  That&#x27;s how light and non-greasy it is!  I was a skeptic about anything that went on my face, but Neutrogena won me over!!!</li>
    <li> Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Quick. Easy. RESULTS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this, I also purchased the Neutrogena 3 piece acne system. You can check out my review for that, but essentially, this worked with minimal effort while the other is a 3-step process. This is super simple to use, just put it on scars, put it when you notice something brewing on your complexion, and when it&#x27;s happening. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and my scar are definitely clearing up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not painful and the tube should last you a while, unlike the 3 piece system that had lots of complaints about running out.</li>
    <li> God Send. This stuff clears up any breakout. I do not use Neutrogena cleansers anymore but this stuff I stay stocked up on.</li>
    <li> Sure is effective and not as drying as original feared. Going to order again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with stubborn acne on and off for about 2 years now (I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties). I tried everything and nothing seemed to do much good. Ordered this on a whim and I am very glad that I did! It clears up pimples lightening fast and has my face smooth and clear for the first time in so long! I am so very happy with this product, would recommend to anyone with stubborn acne.</li>
    <li> waste of money. This doesn&#x27;t work. I generally like neutrogena products but I would recommend the one in the silver tube and purple lid over this one.</li>
    <li> spot treatment that works if you feel it coming otherwise it takes 2-5 day. If you feel it coming then using the day before works great.</li>
    <li> works as promised and cuts down on new breakouts</li>
    <li> Great service. Great product.</li>
    <li> I though this product was OK. It is good for long term acne solution and it made my skin smooth after about 2 week of applying it  but if you want something to zap those zits away fast I would look for a more fast acting treatment</li>
    <li> Cleared up some adult acne that I have been experiencing.</li>
    <li> I am an adult with continued skin problems. This is by far one of the best products I have used. It&#x27;s not greasy. It clears and prevents acne. It makes my skin feel smooth . Most impressively it has helped reduce the size of Milia on my face. Update - I am so upset to find out this has been discontinued as I loved the results of this product. The new version is not comparable.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find  a pimple cream in local drug stores just a bunch of washes and scubs. I bought this for my daughter who is going thru puberty. lol. she would die if she knew i was putting this on the internet. any who, she had a group of pimples on her forehead and i noticed immediate improvement after two days. this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap though.</li>
    <li> it really doesnt help my acne that much and it makes my skin really oily. however it wasnt that expensive</li>
    <li> Seems to be  helping diminish ingrown hairs on my fiancée&#x27;s neck. Who knew?</li>
    <li> It works well just dont put too much</li>
    <li> This product helps reduce dark spots from post acne and current acne. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months. The dark spots on my cheeks have been reduced or a disappeared.</li>
    <li> Good, it works.  The old 2% solution was much more effective.  The size is easy to travel with as well.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for a month and a half and i dont see any changes at all. I would apply it everyday but i dont see any improvements. I will not recommend this product. I would rather invest in a pricier product as long as it works. Ill continue using it until i finish the whole tube and ill update my review then.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 years, and I feel that when I use it with the All in One acne face wash that is goes with, I get fantastic results. I noticed a big difference in my face when I started using the two products together (my zits we&#x27;re almost completely gone!). I&#x27;ve tried this with other face washes, but I&#x27;m going back to this with the All in one face wash. They make the perfect pair! I usually wash my face, put on this treatment, then put on my Clinique acne solutions moisturizer over top, although this treatment would probably work as a moisturizer by itself for most people. Since it has salacylic acid, it&#x27;s great for keeping acne medicine on your face for the whole day.</li>
    <li> neutrogena all in 1 acene control is the best product for my skin, my problem and has a solution, it helps when the skin is red or when my foot is swollen ... looks better without acne since the use .. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have use this product for a while now and I think they work great. I would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This seemed OK at first, but then I had a huge breakout over my entire face a week after starting using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m talking about the biggest breakout I&#x27;ve had in my *entire life*, and I&#x27;m in my 30s and don&#x27;t have much acne now.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this should only be used on a few small spots?</li>
    <li> I tried it for 3 months. i ended breaking out more and it DOES NOT fade old acne scars :(</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help me at all. When I put it on my beginning acne, the next day instead of minimizing it. It made my acne worse and made my beginning acne into white heads. Very upsetting.  Tried various times and every time same result. I guess my skin doesnt work well with product.</li>
    <li> The box it came in was all beat up for a moment I thought there was nothing in it. Seems good though!</li>
    <li> This acne cream is great! It clears your face of most breakouts without drying out your face or turning your skin orange. I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and don&#x27;t leave home without it. The only thing that is not good is the smell is kind of dull.&lt;br /&gt;Did you find this review helpful?</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this product and she finds it really controls her acne. She likes the size of the container.</li>
    <li> This product does work.</li>
    <li> This help me to get the breakout in control great product.</li>
    <li> Just about finished this product cause I just didn&#x27;t wanna give up on it. But I see no improvement I also believe its made my skin worse as far as breakouts and didnt fade any of my dark spots..... On to the next</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week and already see the difference.  I use it in the morning before putting on make-up and before I go to bed.  I have not been able to find anything that clears up the pores on my nose until now.  It really does a great job and my acne problems have been reduced significantly.  However, it does not seem to work as well in the T-zone on my forehead.</li>
    <li> First, I have tried many different acne products including proactive, clean and clear, and nother neutrogena products and this is the best yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Makes skin look and feel great&lt;br /&gt;Treats acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Price for the amount</li>
    <li> It was a good size and works very well. I saved $2 dollars buying it online then in stores. I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product but, sadly, it has been discontinued...</li>
</ol>
