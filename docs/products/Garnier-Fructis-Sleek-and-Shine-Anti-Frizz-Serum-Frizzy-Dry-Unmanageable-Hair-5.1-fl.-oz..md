      <li>I just love it</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>okay</li>

      <li>I actually really love this product.</li>
      <li>You will love it.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;okay</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this on a whim.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, it works wonders on my frizzy, curly hair during the humid summer in NYC.</li>
      <li>I gave this a 5 star and if I could give it more, I would.</li>
      <li>i love this stuff it works great on extensions as well as your natural hair!</li>
      <li>This works great on natural hair too!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just horribly strong in scent.</li>
      <li>My hair is very soft and smells good when I use this product.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really make my hair shiny, but it smells wonderful, makes my hair super soft and tangle free (even in the heat and humidity).</li>
      <li>It kept my hair smooth and added some shine to it.</li>
      <li>My curls and coils are smooth, shiny, frizz free and defined.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just right!</li>
      <li>(The bottle also specifies that it can stand up to 97% humidity - not fully true in my experience, but it does TRY...)    </li>
      <li>I have very wavy hair, and this is better than the salon straightening products for me.</li>
      <li>really love this product makes my hair straight and shiny</li>
      <li>It helps to detangle my hair really nicely and has a nice smell that I like,  It also does not weigh my hair down like a lot of products.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use it without getting all my hair super greasy looking.</li>
      <li>This made my extensions super silky when I was styling it.</li>
      <li>This is a decent, affordable product for frizz control but there are better ones out there.</li>
      <li>I still use it to this day I highly recommend it good for natural hair also if you wear weave</li>
      <li>I love  the Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine line, and the new Brazilian line.</li>
      <li>The product is far too potent to be using the amount that comes out in one pump.  </li>
      <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t work that great and has a little too much oompf!</li>
      <li>PROS:  - Super soft, tangle free hair (even in intense humidity, but it won&#x27;t keep stop my hair from poofing).  </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve found what really works for me!</li>
      <li>You also really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
      <li>This is what I get for buying things without reading reviews first.</li>
      <li>I should say that it sort of helped with frizz, mostly because my hair was such a greaseball that it couldn&#x27;t absorb any additional moisture.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>The Garnier anti-frizz serum has a nice smell, gives just a bit of hold, and doesn&#x27;t look wet all day like hair gel.  </li>
      <li>I was really concerned about trying this product at first.</li>
      <li>This stuff is probably much better suited to thicker hair types (or people with dry hair).</li>
      <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t really need so much frizz-ease, but a bit more moisture &amp; detangling of my dry, chemically treated hair.</li>
      <li>unusual, as it&#x27;s supposed to decrease frizz...</li>
      <li>which EVEN products claiming to give hair SHINE don&#x27;t do!), but it doesn&#x27;t help all that much with frizz</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s naturally straight</li>
      <li>I use it on both you don&#x27;t need to much</li>
      <li>- Won&#x27;t stop dry hair from poofing up in high humidity (but still tangle free!)    </li>
      <li>CONS:  - Not much in the bottle (but still a better deal than most other brands)  </li>
      <li>and I live in a hot, humid climate.  </li>
      <li>- Hair looks much better the second day than the first, even outside.    </li>
      <li>My eyes even bother me significantly if I use it on extensions &amp; leave them in the next room.</li>
      <li>There are many other de-frizz/detanglers to use.</li>
      <li>I should add that I have very fine, straight hair, so I should&#x27;ve known this serum would be too heavy for my hair type.</li>
      <li>These products are much cheaper (at Target &amp; Walmart)  and work better than the more expensive lines.</li>
      <li>I was really worried it would make my hair look greasy and oily, but with my curly hair frizz, I thought the risk was worth the potential reward, I put it on damp hair</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you wear extensions.</li>
      <li>It tends to get a little oily if you take one to many.</li>
      <li>The funny thing is they are not necessarily targeted for natural hair, but they really do work!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday because I don&#x27;t like to have TONS of product in my hair all the time, plus it has silicon in it, and I like to keep my hair safe.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I live in Florida where it is pretty much 98 degrees outside for 80% of the year, and</li>
      <li>If you look at the ingredients, the top 5 listed are the same as all the other more expensive brands you will find at the drugstore, which makes this a value product, however if used continually it may damage your hair and leave it more prone to breakage.</li>
      <li>The oil wasn&#x27;t thick but of a nice thickness (not too watery) and leaves the hair smooth and shiny when it dries unlike some other brands that leaves an oily film on the hair.</li>
      <li>I put it on right before I flat iron</li>
      <li>you must use a pump, oil-based detangler/anti-frizz product, John Frieda Frizz-Ease Hair Serum is far better (use just a tiny, tiny dab on each large section of hair), but John Frieda Frizz-Ease Secret Weapon Finishing Creme is far superior in smell &amp; lack of oily residue the other products deposit.</li>
      <li>This is good as a short term product but not a good long-term solution to frizz.</li>
      <li>I love the smell though it only lasts a little while.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;d stay clear.</li>
      <li>If I end up straightening after use, my hair is so soft.</li>
      <li>and I wear my hair natural.</li>
      <li>Use this with Garnier&#x27;s Blow Dry Creme (comes in a tube) and you will get straight hair that lasts for three days !  </li>
      <li>On days I wear it down though, I do use this product and my hair stays smooth all day long, which is saying something with the humidity in my area.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This works great on natural hair too! I&#x27;m African American and I wear my hair natural. I brought this at Target a few days ago for $4.99. I used it after shampooing and conditioning my hair with  Garnier Fructis Brazilian Sleek &amp; Shine. My hair looks fabulous!. My curls and coils are smooth, shiny, frizz free and defined. My hair feels soft , smells wonderful, and it&#x27;s not tacky or greasy. I love  the Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine line, and the new Brazilian line. I&#x27;ve have been experimenting for a year with other natural hair products. Some of them are quite expensive and don&#x27;t work very well. These products are much cheaper (at Target &amp; Walmart)  and work better than the more expensive lines. The funny thing is they are not necessarily targeted for natural hair, but they really do work!  I think I&#x27;ve found what really works for me!</li>
    <li> I love this!  I have a body wave which can make my hair a little dry and frizzy. I put a little of this in my hair after washing my hair and went ahead and blew it dry and within minutes my hair was silky and shiny and it straightened even the little poofy curls that I can never get to lay flat.  I love the smell though it only lasts a little while.</li>
    <li> This made my extensions super silky when I was styling it. I highly recommend if you wear extensions. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I feel like it is just as good as what they use on my hair at thew salon but less expensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so so. not so good as I thought when I read the words in decribtion. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;anti-frizz&amp;#34; serum actually adds some shine to my hair (which EVEN products claiming to give hair SHINE don&#x27;t do!), but it doesn&#x27;t help all that much with frizz once I leave the house to go to work!  By the time I have reached work (after driving with the windows up and the A/C on to combat the humidity), I hair looks little like the carefully straightened and styled hair from my bathroom that morning.  But it does have SHINE!  GO FIGURE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, if I fix my hair and don&#x27;t go anywhere, I look GREAT!  It is only once my hair is exposed to the humidity outside that this serum is overpowered and defeated.  :(  For Anti-Frizz problem, I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not impressed with this product. It smells great, and does make my hair shiny, but:&lt;br /&gt;-It does nothing for frizziness (which is half the point)&lt;br /&gt;-It can leave your hair a little oily, which means that if you touch your hair and then other things, you feel like you are getting oil everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;-If you try to use more to eliminate frizziness, your hair becomes disgusting - really oily and greasy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this up, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I have thick long wavy hair that frizzes as it dries. If I use this product before my hair air dries all the way through, I can get away with not having to heat treat it. It just looks like beachy waves, and leaves my hair silky and shiny. If I end up straightening after use, my hair is so soft. I can&#x27;t stop touching it. It smells really good too.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I actually really love this product. I have very thin and frizzy hair. Taming it is a challenge indeed. This stuff not only helps control the frizz, it also adds a little bit (not a lot at all) of weight to my very thin hair so that it doesn&#x27;t start frizzing up again hours later. My hair is very soft and smells good when I use this product. I&#x27;m glad I tried this on a whim. This was a successful whim purchase.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star and if I could give it more, I would. A long time user of Loreal anti-frizz serum but couldn&#x27;t find the same product that I was using back in Asia and decided to give this a try. The oil wasn&#x27;t thick but of a nice thickness (not too watery) and leaves the hair smooth and shiny when it dries unlike some other brands that leaves an oily film on the hair. Definitely recommend this to all long hair lasses. You will love it.</li>
    <li> well, i feeling so sad because i never got the product,is simply like that, my wife was wishing for it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It helps to detangle my hair really nicely and has a nice smell that I like,  It also does not weigh my hair down like a lot of products.</li>
    <li> Perfect product. Love my hair!!</li>
    <li> Use with the Triple Nutrition Shampoo and Conditioner. Not a gel, very fluid so use a little unless you have very long hair.</li>
    <li> One i love this stuff it works great on extensions as well as your natural hair! It gives it that perfect natural shine and keeps the frizz away . It also smells extremely good!</li>
    <li> For me, this product just works okay. I bought this because I live in Florida where it is pretty much 98 degrees outside for 80% of the year, and ALWAYS 100% humidity - so given those circumstances, this product puts up a valiant fight, just not enough to fight Florida climate. (The bottle also specifies that it can stand up to 97% humidity - not fully true in my experience, but it does TRY...)    I am naturally blonde (dark blonde) with pretty thick, dry hair that turns into a haystack in the humidity. This product doesn&#x27;t really make my hair shiny, but it smells wonderful, makes my hair super soft and tangle free (even in the heat and humidity). It doesn&#x27;t stop my hair from poofing up and it doesn&#x27;t battle the frizz. For me, it only works okay (I imagine if you lived someplace else with normal humidity it would be marvelous). Still, it&#x27;s better than if I wear nothing, so I will probably keep using it.    PROS:  - Super soft, tangle free hair (even in intense humidity, but it won&#x27;t keep stop my hair from poofing).  - Price is good (BUY IN STORE! I bought mine from my local grocery store, HALF PRICE there than on Amazon)  - Smells yummy (but I don&#x27;t think the smell lasts all day).  - Hair looks excellent INSIDE, just not if I go outside.  - Hair looks much better the second day than the first, even outside.    CONS:  - Not much in the bottle (but still a better deal than most other brands)  - Won&#x27;t stop frizz  - Won&#x27;t stop dry hair from poofing up in high humidity (but still tangle free!)    NITPICKS:  - Feels really oily on your hands and is somewhat uncomfortable to put in, but it&#x27;s a serum, so \\&quot;okay...\\&quot;  - Bottle claims serum will hold up in 97% humidity - LOL they&#x27;ve never been to Florida.</li>
    <li> Have only used twice. Product recommended by friend seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> I used to use a more expensive brand, but one day my store was out of it so I got this one instead.  It has a nice smell to it and keeps the frizz away.</li>
    <li> Use this with Garnier&#x27;s Blow Dry Creme (comes in a tube) and you will get straight hair that lasts for three days !  I have very wavy hair, and this is better than the salon straightening products for me.</li>
    <li> This is a decent, affordable product for frizz control but there are better ones out there. It tends to get a little oily if you take one to many. But it still does its job well.</li>
    <li> makes my hair manageable</li>
    <li> Works great on my peruvian wavy hair! It&#x27;s not too oily or anything it&#x27;s just right! I just love it</li>
    <li> So I have slightly wavy hair that tend to be really dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells really good&lt;br /&gt;-Makes hair shiny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Did NOTHING to tame my frizziness&lt;br /&gt;-Made hair look worse&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves hair frizzy even after flat ironing (which has never happened)</li>
    <li> I am a man with short, curly hair.  I&#x27;m pretty active and I live in a hot, humid climate.  I end up showering far too often which turns my hair to dry, frizzy garbage.  I don&#x27;t like the texture that gel or hairspray give my hair.  The Garnier anti-frizz serum has a nice smell, gives just a bit of hold, and doesn&#x27;t look wet all day like hair gel.  If you&#x27;ve got a dryness problem I would recommend using this product with the [[ASIN:B005GQ6HUK Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Leave-In Conditioning Cream]] for a deeper treatment (although not at the same time).</li>
    <li> This product is awfully greasy &amp; has a horribly strong aroma. I have a lot of hair, color treated &amp; medium density. It&#x27;s naturally straight &amp; I don&#x27;t really need so much frizz-ease, but a bit more moisture &amp; detangling of my dry, chemically treated hair. When using this product to detangle, my eyes burn so much, it&#x27;s incredible. My eyes even bother me significantly if I use it on extensions &amp; leave them in the next room. It&#x27;s just horribly strong in scent. Even if it did work to detangle (it does, but it makes hair frizzy &amp; oh, so greasy), the smell is so pungent, it permeates the house... 1,600 sf townhouse. No kidding. I also have to wash my brush every single time I use this product in my hair, as it&#x27;s so oily I can&#x27;t use it without getting all my hair super greasy looking. So, I&#x27;d give it 2* for working to detangle, but it&#x27;s so greasy &amp; frizzy afterwards (even when using just a dab)... unusual, as it&#x27;s supposed to decrease frizz... my hair looks like a fright wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you must use a pump, oil-based detangler/anti-frizz product, John Frieda Frizz-Ease Hair Serum is far better (use just a tiny, tiny dab on each large section of hair), but John Frieda Frizz-Ease Secret Weapon Finishing Creme is far superior in smell &amp; lack of oily residue the other products deposit. Also, the latter is the only one I&#x27;ve used which doesn&#x27;t leave my hair so greasy, as if it hasn&#x27;t been washed. Still, use a small dab... you can always use more, if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this product, even though their hair conditioners are great &amp; smell good, too, this product is a huge dud. There are many other de-frizz/detanglers to use.</li>
    <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work that great and has a little too much oompf! The product is far too potent to be using the amount that comes out in one pump.  That being said, it is nice and good smelling.  I have a lot of hair so I end up finding a use for the extra product, but I tend to like my other brand because of it and this one sits alone.</li>
    <li> really love this product makes my hair straight and shiny all you have to do is blow dry regular not much</li>
    <li> This was a good product and affordable it does what is suppose to do I still use it to this day I highly recommend it good for natural hair also if you wear weave I use it on both you don&#x27;t need to much and it last long</li>
    <li> Miracle for dry hair! I put it on right before I flat iron my Brazilian hair</li>
    <li> Garnier has been a go to of mine for hair care and this product is a reason why.  I love the smell, it works wonders on my frizzy, curly hair during the humid summer in NYC.</li>
    <li> This is what I get for buying things without reading reviews first. This made my hair heavy and greasy, and I swear it took me at least a week to wash it all out. I should say that it sort of helped with frizz, mostly because my hair was such a greaseball that it couldn&#x27;t absorb any additional moisture.  I should add that I have very fine, straight hair, so I should&#x27;ve known this serum would be too heavy for my hair type. Ah well. This stuff is probably much better suited to thicker hair types (or people with dry hair). Otherwise, I&#x27;d stay clear.</li>
    <li> I was really concerned about trying this product at first. I was really worried it would make my hair look greasy and oily, but with my curly hair frizz, I thought the risk was worth the potential reward, I put it on damp hair and I really liked it. It kept my hair smooth and added some shine to it. I don&#x27;t use it everyday because I don&#x27;t like to have TONS of product in my hair all the time, plus it has silicon in it, and I like to keep my hair safe. On days I wear it down though, I do use this product and my hair stays smooth all day long, which is saying something with the humidity in my area. I always tell people about this product when they complain about their frizz. You also really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Takes away the frizz, good product</li>
    <li> This is good as a short term product but not a good long-term solution to frizz. If you look at the ingredients, the top 5 listed are the same as all the other more expensive brands you will find at the drugstore, which makes this a value product, however if used continually it may damage your hair and leave it more prone to breakage. I&#x27;m not sure if it is due to the silicone, but essentially this serum coats the strands of your hair, reducing friction, but in turn plasticizes the individual strands which leads to dryness and breakage, since the hair shaft can evaporate water but not absorb moisture in the environment. In point, use this product once in a while only (not frequently!), and apply to clean, dry hair and after all heating treatments (flat iron, curling iron etc) have been used, so as not to fry the product into your hair.</li>
