      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>

      <li>Perfect - I saw a difference with the very first use and am really pleased with the continued results of this product.</li>
      <li>It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness/residue.</li>
      <li>but that person really liked it so it just wasn&#x27;t for my skin.</li>
      <li>I hope Amazon keeps a better eye on returns; but in fairness if I hadn&#x27;t been suspicious because of the ripped bag, I might not have noticed the used bottle.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this lotion.  </li>
      <li>I love anything in this brand of beauty products...</li>
      <li>While I still miss the Olay Quench brand, this is an okay replacement.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite lotion.  </li>
      <li>I like most of the Olay product line.</li>
      <li>This was my go-to Lotion for years,then I stopped being able to find it in stores.</li>
      <li>This is the only thing that I can use as a face moisturizer (yes &amp; it is perfect for me) that does NOT break me out.</li>
      <li>I love that it is unscented also.</li>
      <li>This one is fragrance free, and I was irritation free!</li>
      <li>One time application after bath and good for the whole day.</li>
      <li>This lotion is very good for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Like this one very much!  </li>
      <li>It is a rich, smooth, creamy lotion that soaks in quickly and leaves your skin silky soft.  </li>
      <li>Not much smell, which is good for someone with a lot of allergies.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice if the product was sold with a smaller version to drop in my pocket book.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of body lotions because of my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Very good price and very long lasting.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly, and I actually use it more as hand lotion.  </li>
      <li>Absorbed fast, not oily and actually smells nice.</li>
      <li>is first moisturizing</li>
      <li>It was my go to lotion because I credit it with changing my skin for the better, I actually noticed changes in texture and increases moisture retention.</li>
      <li>so thanks for carrying it!</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t believe that this Olay advanced healing intensive lotion works noticeably better on my dry skin than the dermatologist prescribed Cetaphil daily advanced ultra hydrating lotion that I used for 1.5 years.</li>
      <li>I feel a little more confident in my problematic skin not following me to my grave.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t work very well on my skin</li>
      <li>It really provides moisture without being too watery or greasy.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin &amp; have tried all kinds of different lotions, some that were recommended by dermatologist &amp; this works better for my skin than anything I have EVER come across.</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and it really moisturizes!</li>
      <li>Thanks Olay for finally making something total worth the money....!!</li>
      <li>My hardcore moisturizer for dry spots is Eucerin Ointment and this Olay Advanced Healing is my all-over-the-body lotion.</li>
      <li>I have tried MANY and like FEW.  </li>
      <li>it dried it out more than anything</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did as it works really well in keeping my skin soft all year round.</li>
      <li>The other 2 were fine</li>
      <li>My skin is finally clear &amp; smooth &amp; not breaking out due to the lotion/moisturizer I&#x27;m using.</li>
      <li>It is pretty expensive to buy online and ship, but none of my local stores carry it any more.  </li>
      <li>My elbows and knees actually felt soft while I was using this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was my go-to Lotion for years,then I stopped being able to find it in stores. I can still find it online, but it seems to be getting phased out. Unfortunately Olay doesn&#x27;t seem to have a replacement for severely dry skin. The formula of this may have Also changed I think. It was my go to lotion because I credit it with changing my skin for the better, I actually noticed changes in texture and increases moisture retention. Now I use the North American Hemp Co. HHG lotion.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion.  It is pretty expensive to buy online and ship, but none of my local stores carry it any more.  It is the only lotion I have found that prevents dry skin in the winter.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for some good ultra hydrating body lotion cream this one will not disappoint!  I have tried MANY and like FEW.  This is one that helps with very dry skin.  Affordable too.  Good product.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Shipment was to arrive in 7 to 10 days and it arrived sooner than expected. Great deal on lotion. This lotion is very good for dry skin. Non greasey feeling.</li>
    <li> Competes with WalMart but without the hassle of a big box store. I have a love hate thing with WM and the hate is overcoming the love.</li>
    <li> I had a bottle of this lotion from last winter season. When I went to purchase again, I could not find this in the local stores.  It is a rich, smooth, creamy lotion that soaks in quickly and leaves your skin silky soft.  My hardcore moisturizer for dry spots is Eucerin Ointment and this Olay Advanced Healing is my all-over-the-body lotion.</li>
    <li> in OLAY! I started this regimen in March and I can&#x27;t believe that this Olay advanced healing intensive lotion works noticeably better on my dry skin than the dermatologist prescribed Cetaphil daily advanced ultra hydrating lotion that I used for 1.5 years. Olay appears to wake up problem areas of my dry skin beginning to show signs of lessening those problem areas. I feel a little more confident in my problematic skin not following me to my grave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Not greasy. Not watered down.  And you only have to apply it once a day rather than several times a day.</li>
    <li> really good stuff esp if you get it when its discounted here on amazon, I did subscribe and save to get an even lower price but sadly the price jumps up and down so you need to monitor it and get it when its on discount and sometimes there is a clip coupon link!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work very well on my skin is first moisturizing it dried it out more than anything so I gave it away but that person really liked it so it just wasn&#x27;t for my skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great on my skin. My kids use it too. Absorbed fast, not oily and actually smells nice. Good stuff. God price.</li>
    <li> I love anything in this brand of beauty products...I have tried almost all the variety of body lotions by Olay and so far I have not been disappointed. It would be nice if the product was sold with a smaller version to drop in my pocket book. Keep the good products OLAY!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this version of Oil of Olay when they discontinued their skin quenching line. I am so glad I did as it works really well in keeping my skin soft all year round.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of body lotions because of my sensitive skin. This one is fragrance free, and I was irritation free! It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness/residue. My elbows and knees actually felt soft while I was using this product. I will be going back to this one again and again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion.  Nothing else compares.  I love that it is unscented also.</li>
    <li> Like this one very much!  Very good price and very long lasting.  Not much smell, which is good for someone with a lot of allergies.  I like most of the Olay product line.</li>
    <li> product as described--</li>
    <li> While I still miss the Olay Quench brand, this is an okay replacement.  I personally would recommend Rex eme cream for the extremely dry and this for daily use.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great!  It absorbs quickly, and I actually use it more as hand lotion.  The one bad thing:  when I received it from Amazon, the 3 bottles were in a ripped bag and one of the bottles had been used.  I could see lotion in the tip of the pump, but it had been pushed back inside the bottle.  The other 2 were fine and I was desperate for the lotion(can&#x27;t get it in stores) so I kept them and threw the other one out.  I hope Amazon keeps a better eye on returns; but in fairness if I hadn&#x27;t been suspicious because of the ripped bag, I might not have noticed the used bottle.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin &amp; have tried all kinds of different lotions, some that were recommended by dermatologist &amp; this works better for my skin than anything I have EVER come across. For whatever reason, I can no longer find it in stores. This is the only thing that I can use as a face moisturizer (yes &amp; it is perfect for me) that does NOT break me out. If Olay ever stops making this, I will cry because I do not know what I&#x27;ll do. My skin is finally clear &amp; smooth &amp; not breaking out due to the lotion/moisturizer I&#x27;m using.</li>
    <li> Perfect - I saw a difference with the very first use and am really pleased with the continued results of this product.</li>
    <li> Thanks Olay for finally making something total worth the money....!! One time application after bath and good for the whole day. And finally there is one product from Olay that doesn&#x27;t give me pimples or rash...!!</li>
    <li> Use lotions everyday, Water dries out my skin and I can&#x27;t stand the itchy scratchy feeling.  Olay fits the bill.</li>
    <li> I hope this isn&#x27;t being taken off the Olay line! I can only find it here now so thanks for carrying it!</li>
    <li> Gave this product four stars because it&#x27;s a great moisturizer but will not even your skin tone. I used it morning and night for about three months and seen no results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Proctor and Gamble, nor any of the olay of olay products.  However, this lotion is one of my favorites.  It really provides moisture without being too watery or greasy.  My skin is so soft and it really moisturizes!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two years and recommended it to a lot of people.  Unfortunately this seems to be the only place it is still available as Walmart is no longer carrying it in Oregon.</li>
