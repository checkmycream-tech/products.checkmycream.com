      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>To give you an idea of the size, they all fit easily and there is still plenty of room</li>
      <li>I liked this so much</li>
      <li>I have not had any breakage, and the lids still close securely.  </li>
      <li>so I can apportion two week&#x27;s worth at a time and am ordering two more for backups.</li>
      <li>and they fit with room to spare in these dispensers.</li>
      <li>After taking an emergency preparedness class, I&#x27;m adding two more sets, so I can put two weeks worth with my emergency supplies outdoors, and then rotate them in once in a while.</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>

      <li>Perfect for larger vitamins and pills or for multiple doses of pills in 2 convenient compartments per day.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and well-packaged.  </li>
      <li>size is a good size and the overall design would be handy if I can just get them to open easier.</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve said before, I take a lot of large pills, and these containers easily hold them all.    </li>
      <li>(Thursday&#x27;s special, it gets bright pink.)</li>
      <li>I love how big this is, that it has the days labeled on them and how easy it is to take the prefaced day with you.  </li>
      <li>We take a lot of supplements, and these little containers are GREAT for keeping up with all that.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d have expected many more issues.  </li>
      <li>I just run them through with warm soapy water (hand wash), and let them air dry thoroughly before refilling.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using 2 of these for about 4 months and the lids are fine so far.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
      <li>I take several nutritional supplements, and prefer to be able to set up my pill box for a week at a time.  </li>
      <li>My husband takes many meds on a daily basis.  </li>
      <li>This is big, so I&#x27;ll be able to read it till I&#x27;m 90.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are quite large but so much easier to carry one day&#x27;s worth than the four cases I used to lug around.  </li>
      <li>The compartments are very large, capable of handling a number of large capsules.</li>
      <li>These make it easy to grab the pills I need for the day and everything fits in a smaller container.  </li>
      <li>(you could still fit at leasts 4 more large pills or a LOT of small pills).  </li>
      <li>box is easy to fill and is large enough to hold everything.</li>
      <li>As you may know, supplements tend to be large capsules and/or pills.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to transport one day&#x27;s medication without having to take the whole week or, worse, putting them in your pocket or purse loose.</li>
      <li>I was worried that these wouldn&#x27;t be big enough to hold a day&#x27;s worth, but each side holds about 20 meds (mixture of huge capsules to tiny pills).Really pleased with these in every way.  </li>
      <li>So obviously I need something huge to hold them all.  </li>
      <li>Really, what&#x27;s there to say?</li>
      <li>Thanks for the reviews.</li>
      <li>So much easier.  </li>
      <li>The individual containers easily fit into a purse.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering how much stress they can take before breaking off.  </li>
      <li>I have been using these for 6 months and they are holding up very well.</li>
      <li>Very spacious design.</li>
      <li>The clear lids come off easily to refill the boxes, and each day is a different color.</li>
      <li>I have to open 11 different bottles and cut two of the pills, so it is much more efficient to do a whole month at a time.  </li>
      <li>It is very convenient to have a whole weeks worth of meds sorted so compactly, and I can take out the containers for just one or two days if I&#x27;m going somewhere overnight, without having to take a giant weekly pill organizer with me.  </li>
      <li>I used a label-maker to put names on each individual box and the tray (for quick ID and no medication errors).  </li>
      <li>The top is one piece of plastic that bends in the middle every time you open a compartment.  </li>
      <li>The different colors for each day also really helps us know that everyone has the right day in their hands.  </li>
      <li>I must admit that filling a full week of containers is a bit clumsy and time consuming, but I&#x27;m sure it saves time and fuss in the long run.  </li>
      <li>I have used many pill organizers in the past (I don&#x27;t take medication - just a lot of supplements), and I have never (until now) found a unit which was large enough to accomodate all the pills I take (both in the morning and in the afternoon).  </li>
      <li>On a longer trip, this is SO much more convenient than carrying all the separate containers, and if you have to take a lot of pills, or if some of them are large, standard pills organizers are way too small.  </li>
      <li>The compartments are large enough for all my medicines and supplements.</li>
      <li>So far keeps my pills straight, I only use for vitamins.  </li>
      <li>The daily boxes fit into a rectangular holder with a smaller footprint than the traditional style.</li>
      <li>No big deal, and with as many times as these have been opened and closed in the last 16 months</li>
      <li>Better than I expected, just what I needed to keep my daily pills organized for daily use with night &amp; Day.</li>
      <li>The individual boxes are also very convenient.</li>
      <li>Some are small but others are huge.  </li>
      <li>Large enough to store several pills.</li>
      <li>I help my partner with his meds and vitamins which he takes daily and never could find a pill organizer large enough.</li>
      <li>So I needed something large enough to hold several of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These compartments are plenty big to hold vitamins and other large pills with room to spare!</li>
      <li>it still works fine, but when I open all the boxes to fill them up once a week, the one box won&#x27;t stay in the open position because it came apart at the center seam a little.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I help my partner with his meds and vitamins which he takes daily and never could find a pill organizer large enough. These work out prefect. Lots of room in the compartments and he has no problem opening them. Would tell anyone who needs lots of room for there meds to get them. Great for traveling as well.</li>
    <li> I have successfully used this for over a year now.  Some of the lids are just starting to get loose.   This will handle all of my regular medications as well as daily supplements.   Loads of storage.  Fits easily in a gallon zip lock bag for packing.</li>
    <li> hard to open at times... good thing I have some nails!</li>
    <li> We take a lot of supplements, and these little containers are GREAT for keeping up with all that.  I used a label-maker to put names on each individual box and the tray (for quick ID and no medication errors).  We have five trays (35 boxes), and only one box has given me any trouble... it still works fine, but when I open all the boxes to fill them up once a week, the one box won&#x27;t stay in the open position because it came apart at the center seam a little.  No big deal, and with as many times as these have been opened and closed in the last 16 months, I&#x27;d have expected many more issues.  I don&#x27;t know if these are dishwasher safe.  I just run them through with warm soapy water (hand wash), and let them air dry thoroughly before refilling.  I was worried that these wouldn&#x27;t be big enough to hold a day&#x27;s worth, but each side holds about 20 meds (mixture of huge capsules to tiny pills).Really pleased with these in every way.  The different colors for each day also really helps us know that everyone has the right day in their hands.  Shipped quickly and well-packaged.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> If you take a lot of supplements like I do, this is the only case I have found with enough room.  I love that I can take them with me each day.</li>
    <li> Perfect for larger vitamins and pills or for multiple doses of pills in 2 convenient compartments per day. Very useful.</li>
    <li> I can pick up the day of the week and throw it in my purse and I have all my meds and vitamins for am and pm.</li>
    <li> this large pill box doesn&#x27;t hold all my pills it is useless to me&lt;br /&gt;buy it if you don&#x27;t have many pills</li>
    <li> Very spacious design. Well thought of and just what I needed to organize my pills. However, the build quality isn&#x27;t all that great and I can already see the lids being loosened up with just a couple of weeks usage.</li>
    <li> Really, what&#x27;s there to say? I&#x27;m a Boomer, I need my supplements. This is big, so I&#x27;ll be able to read it till I&#x27;m 90.</li>
    <li> I have used many pill organizers in the past (I don&#x27;t take medication - just a lot of supplements), and I have never (until now) found a unit which was large enough to accomodate all the pills I take (both in the morning and in the afternoon).  This does the job.</li>
    <li> Great concept and design. But the build quality sucks, the plastic lids started to break and fall apart from the first use.</li>
    <li> Easy for traveling and I bought two sets so I only need to fill boxes every two weeks.  Great purchase so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for 6 months and they are holding up very well. I love the size .</li>
    <li> I take a lot of pills and supplements - some in the am and the rest in the pm. I like to fill my pill box once a week. and be done with it.&lt;br /&gt;This box is easy to fill and is large enough to hold everything. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Update: August 2016 I now own 6 sets of these!  I&#x27;ve had some for about 5 years and some for about 3, and all the lids are still working well.  I fill up 6 weeks in advance, and if I need to travel, I just grab the weeks I need for the trip (plus an extra week in case of an emergency).  I like that I can either keep a whole week&#x27;s pills together in their tray, or pull out one day at a time or as many as I need.  As I&#x27;ve said before, I take a lot of large pills, and these containers easily hold them all.    I&#x27;ve been using 2 of these for about 4 months and the lids are fine so far.  I put about 5 really big pills (giant vitamin and calcium pills), and 10 smaller pills in each one.  To give you an idea of the size, they all fit easily and there is still plenty of room (you could still fit at leasts 4 more large pills or a LOT of small pills).  I separate my prescription medications and supplements into a.m. and p.m. categories, although I actually take some of them before, and some after each meal.  It is very convenient to have a whole weeks worth of meds sorted so compactly, and I can take out the containers for just one or two days if I&#x27;m going somewhere overnight, without having to take a giant weekly pill organizer with me.  The individual containers easily fit into a purse.  The lids close VERY securely.  On a longer trip, this is SO much more convenient than carrying all the separate containers, and if you have to take a lot of pills, or if some of them are large, standard pills organizers are way too small.  I decided to write this review because I am about to order 2 more.  May 6, 2013 I&#x27;ve been using these daily for about 3 years now.  I have not had any breakage, and the lids still close securely.  I have to open 11 different bottles and cut two of the pills, so it is much more efficient to do a whole month at a time.  After taking an emergency preparedness class, I&#x27;m adding two more sets, so I can put two weeks worth with my emergency supplies outdoors, and then rotate them in once in a while.</li>
    <li> At least they stay closed! would be kind of  nice to have a divider in both compartments to separate pills just a little more.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected, just what I needed to keep my daily pills organized for daily use with night &amp; Day.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely a good size for me, and very convenient to use.  I must admit that filling a full week of containers is a bit clumsy and time consuming, but I&#x27;m sure it saves time and fuss in the long run.  My only concern is the &amp;#34;hinge&amp;#34;.  The top is one piece of plastic that bends in the middle every time you open a compartment.  I&#x27;m wondering how much stress they can take before breaking off.  So far so good but I&#x27;ve only opened and closed them once or twice</li>
    <li> I wasnot very impressed with this purchase.  The lids are not easy to open.  The containers are not easy to fill.  I won&#x27;t get these again.</li>
    <li> So far keeps my pills straight, I only use for vitamins.  Easy access</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Pill Organizer.  My husband has many&lt;br /&gt;pills to take.  Some are small but others are huge.  They all&lt;br /&gt;fit nicely in these organizers.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> My daughter takes a lot of medicine daily and I bought this to help organize it.  The size is great and I love the days are all separate.  We only had it for 2 to 3 weeks and one box dropped on the floor; it cracked and doesn&#x27;t shut anymore.  Soon after 4 of the 7 are now cracked and unable to shut.  If it were more durable, I would give it 5 stars but because I now have to buy something else entirely it gets 2 stars.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several vitamin/prescription pill holders. This is the best I have found.  Large enough to store several pills. Easy to use. Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I love the individual boxes which make it great for travel.  It is a little hard to open and I have issues with my hands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive and needed to last me 7 months, some of the compartment doors broke off because of wear</li>
    <li> I take several nutritional supplements, and prefer to be able to set up my pill box for a week at a time.  These compartments are plenty big to hold vitamins and other large pills with room to spare!</li>
    <li> I have way too many pills to take in a day.  I counted 53 the other day.  So obviously I need something huge to hold them all.  I love how big this is, that it has the days labeled on them and how easy it is to take the prefaced day with you.  With my previous pill holders, I would have to put each group of meds into little baggies to take with me to work.  So much easier.  I may get another because I have 5 different times during the day to take meds and I just love this set-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using four pill cases and having to carry around all of my pills for the week in a cosmetic bag.  These make it easy to grab the pills I need for the day and everything fits in a smaller container.  I take 35 pills a day (many of them large) and they fit with room to spare in these dispensers. I turn each day over when I&#x27;ve taken them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received them so I can&#x27;t speak to how they will hold up.  The lids are secured and snap tightly -- I anticipate no flying off or popping open as with others I have used.  Opening one side incurs no risk of accidentally spilling the other. I don&#x27;t find them hard to open.  They don&#x27;t have a large lip though and someone with limited use of their hands might have trouble with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are quite large but so much easier to carry one day&#x27;s worth than the four cases I used to lug around.  Thanks for the reviews. I ordered two so I can apportion two week&#x27;s worth at a time and am ordering two more for backups.</li>
    <li> I finally gave in &amp; bought a pill organizer. I have MS and have recently started taking a lot of supplements, in addition to my regular medications. As you may know, supplements tend to be large capsules and/or pills. So I needed something large enough to hold several of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ideal. Each box is a day &amp; each one has a side for AM and a side for PM. You can open just one side, while the other stays closed. There is plenty of room for several supplements, with room to spare. The design makes it a space save. Each box stands up in its side &amp; forms a nice neat line. The individual boxes are also very convenient. If you know you won&#x27;t be at home, just take out the day you need &amp; pop it in your pocket or purse. The doors on the boxes are a little stiff at first but loosen up and they snap shut tightly so no doors popping open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with this organizer!</li>
    <li> This organizer is wonderful. The compartments are large enough for all my medicines and supplements. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> My husband takes many meds on a daily basis.  He travels for work andfinds this pill organizer easier to use than most</li>
    <li> These compartments are individually portable. It&#x27;s great to be able to transport one day&#x27;s medication without having to take the whole week or, worse, putting them in your pocket or purse loose. The compartments are very large, capable of handling a number of large capsules.</li>
    <li> Instead of having the morning and evening compartments end-to-end, this nifty little system puts them side-by-side. The clear lids come off easily to refill the boxes, and each day is a different color. (Thursday&#x27;s special, it gets bright pink.) The daily boxes fit into a rectangular holder with a smaller footprint than the traditional style. I liked this so much I bought a second one.</li>
    <li> I am hoping these will be easier to open with use.  Right now, some compartments are very difficult to open....more so than any I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;The size is a good size and the overall design would be handy if I can just get them to open easier.</li>
