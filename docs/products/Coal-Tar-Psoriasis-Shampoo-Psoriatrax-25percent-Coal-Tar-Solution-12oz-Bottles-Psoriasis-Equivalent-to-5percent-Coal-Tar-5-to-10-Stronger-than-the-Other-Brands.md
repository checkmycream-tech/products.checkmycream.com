      <li>thanks for a great product.</li>
      <li>I have had scalp psoriasis for many years and have tried many remedies.  </li>
      <li>It was a very clean shampoo that smelled of nothing more than coal tar.</li>
      <li>I am so happy it has been years since my scalp was normal.</li>
      <li>This used to be the single best coal tar product available.</li>
      <li>Coal tar based shampoo has always worked the best in my experience, and the easiest to use, and this is the only product I know of that still uses a therapeutic amount of coal tart in their product to be useful.  </li>
      <li>Easy to work with shipper.</li>
      <li>The consistency and strength is not as strong.</li>
      <li>Strong solution works well</li>
      <li>The perfume they&#x27;ve used would embarrass a cheap whore.</li>
      <li>Info on Psoria Trax said it contained the maximum strength coal tar available.  </li>
      <li>and we could cut it to fit</li>
      <li>At this price, three is more economical and I will always have it on hand.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my scalp scale and itch free.</li>
      <li>It is turning my hair light brown in streaks.</li>
      <li>I found this shampoo and Elta Tar ointment (also available on Amazon but shop around...</li>
      <li>This product works as good as the old Pentrax brand that was taken off the market.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is very strong and fast acting, also very effective as a body wash.</li>
      <li>but we insert a good pump that fit this bottle except too long</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for keeping this product in stock and available, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
      <li>Thank you for making such a good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all true.</li>
      <li>The chemical smell is acceptable and goes away quickly when hair dries.  </li>
      <li>If you liked the old Pentrax, this is an exact equivalent.</li>
      <li>it tackled the problem right away saw results really quick</li>
      <li>Make sure you follow up use with an ultra moisturizing natural conditioner.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>however I will have to shampoo her hair more frequently now than before.</li>
      <li>After searching unsuccessfully for a product called Zetar, I looked for the best possible other coal tar shampoo.  </li>
      <li>it soothed the redness and inflamed scalp right away</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>I used Pentrax for a long time until the product went off the market, and have been looking for a substitute that was as effective.  </li>
      <li>I am on week 1 of using Psoriatrax shampoo and already there is a huge reduction in itching and new eruptions.</li>
      <li>then you might consider giving this a try by going with one bottle first like we did.</li>
      <li>Works better than the topical steroid solution my dermatologist gave me, and way cheaper!</li>
      <li>I tried many shampoos and this is the only one that worked.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve sinced purchased several more bottles.  </li>
      <li>Some people swear they have got off the prescriptions and have better luck with these or switching back and forth when ones system becomes immune to the helping effects which can happen to some people.</li>
      <li>sure it&#x27;s the same except it takes twice as much!</li>
      <li>The first time I let it stay on my scalp for one hour.  </li>
      <li>After the first washing it did not itch, or flake again.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a similar product ever since and was so glad to find this product.  </li>
      <li>Psoriatrax did the trick; and infact worked better than the Neutrogena Extra Strength ever had.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For those who grew up with Zetar this is a real help for scalp plaque buildup!</li>
      <li>Had a tough time finding a good strong coal tar shampoo after they quite making Pentrax.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough how much I depend on, and love this product.</li>
      <li>Since I have started this regimen everything has disappeared from my hands (unexpected bonus), and my scalp fluctuates between completely gone and mostly gone.  </li>
      <li>Works great on itchy scalp due to heat/sweat related  rash/bumps.</li>
      <li>am very grateful to have found a product that really works again!</li>
      <li>Nothing else seemed to be strong enough to keep the psoriasis away.  </li>
      <li>Psoria Trax is strong enough and it got the job done!</li>
      <li>I love the new packaging,  but the product has definitely chgd.</li>
      <li>Very highly recommend it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is the best shampoos I&#x27;ve used since I got psoriasis in my scalp.  But, I paid for the Buy 2 get one at 1/2 price deal, but only received two bottles in the package.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have a condition that causes little blisters to form on our scalps.  It takes several days for these to form and usually with only one or two uses it will clear up our scalps for over a week.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 8 months now and it is very effective against psoriasis.  I have psoriasis on my scalp, and on my hands.  My Dr has Ok&#x27;d me to use it 2 to 5 times a week (depending on condition).  I first shampoo with Equate Medicated Shampoo (Wal-Mart, less than $4.00) 2.5% coal tar, rinse and then use the PsoriaTrax (5% coal tar).  I massage it in well using my palms and finger pads (not fingernails), and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before rinsing.  Since I have started this regimen everything has disappeared from my hands (unexpected bonus), and my scalp fluctuates between completely gone and mostly gone.  I have noticed a sensitivity to sunlight; I now sunburn very easily on my face (I can put up with that).   This works quite well for me, hope it works for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from psoriatic arthritis for quite a few years.  One of the symptoms with which I dealt is the constant flaking in my hair and beard.  For years, if I always had flakes all over my clothes, I avoided wearing dark colors to minimize the visibility of the flakes.  If I ran my hands through my beard or hair it almost seemed like it would be snowing.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous products and even some medications given to me by my dermatologist.  I tried some a national brand coal tar ointment and it seemed to offer some relief for the psoriatic patches on my skin so I began looking for other products.  I found this shampoo and Elta Tar ointment (also available on Amazon but shop around...a 16oz tub will cost anywhere from $30-$60).&lt;br /&gt;  All I can say is this stuff works.  It is truly amazing.  It may be expensive but it is worth the price.  I noticed a difference in a matter of days and after using it for a couple of months not I don&#x27;t notice any flaking on my scalp or under my bear at all.  I can again wear dark colors without the embarassment of being covered by flakes.  Thanks for a great product!  I highly recommend it...I&#x27;d recommend purchasing the three pack as it saves you a little if it is a product you re going to continue to use.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. Best price on the web at the time</li>
    <li> If you have psoriasis, you must try this product.  PsoriaTrax completely eliminates psoriasis flaking on my scalp.  I&#x27;ve tried other coal tar shampoos, such as Neutrogena, but they don&#x27;t work.  PsoriaTrax works (5% coal tar is critical; less concentrated formulas don&#x27;t work).    Years ago, there was another 5% coal tar shampoo on the market called PenTrax.  It worked equally well but was discontinued.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a similar product ever since and was so glad to find this product.  I first purchased one bottle to try it out and after a couple of weeks of use, my scalp psoriasis completely went away.  I&#x27;ve sinced purchased several more bottles.  I will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Had a tough time finding a good strong coal tar shampoo after they quite making Pentrax.  But this seems to be a good product for us psoriasis folks. Seems like everything that works good someone thinks is bad for us.</li>
    <li> Works really well with my husband&#x27;s psoriasis. He asked me to buy him more as he was very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Since they took Sebutone off the market a few years ago this stuff is a lifesaver.  It takes care of a variety of conditions.  I wish it could be a little less expensive but it&#x27;s cheaper than an Rx.</li>
    <li> I have a moderately severe psoriasis problem.  i used Pentrax in the past, but it has been discontinued.  Nothing else seemed to be strong enough to keep the psoriasis away.  This one works well.</li>
    <li> Bought 4 bottles unfortunately this product did not work for me</li>
    <li> I started using this product when Pentrax was taken off the market.  I hate that I must use it almost daily to fight back my seborrhea but it is very effective.  Unsure what the long term consequences will be with the exposure to the coal tar.</li>
    <li> I can hardly find any tar products in the store that have an adequate level of tar. This product works as good as the old Pentrax brand that was taken off the market.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very strong and fast acting, also very effective as a body wash. You can see dramatic difference immediately. I highly recommend using this daily if you have psoriasis.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing, it works 100%&lt;br /&gt;  it tackled the problem right away saw results really quick&lt;br /&gt;  it soothed the redness and inflamed scalp right away&lt;br /&gt;  surprising to see a product work so well, and as described&lt;br /&gt;  if you are experiencing this problem please give this product a try, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple of months and see an improvement-I would definately recommend trying this.</li>
    <li> Denorex used to make a coal tar shampoo, but since thy switched their formula and took the coal tar out it stopped helping the itch. Both my husband and I use this, my scalp is the worst.</li>
    <li> this is the only product that works for my inflamed scalp.  The chemical smell is acceptable and goes away quickly when hair dries.  Works great on itchy scalp due to heat/sweat related  rash/bumps.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that has ever helped cure my dandruff.  It&#x27;s an excellent product that you don&#x27;t even have to use every shampoo.</li>
    <li> This has to be a new formulation as the previous version could not be sold in California. I do not know what makes this formulation different, but as long as it works like the old version, I will be well satisfied.  NONE of the various commercial brands work for me, but this does - what more can one ask?</li>
    <li> I purchased thinking more is better.  It advertises 5% equivalent coal tar vs my current brand 3% so I gave it a try.  It didn&#x27;t work at all.  I went back to MG217 Psoriasis Medicated Conditioning Coal Tar Formula Shampoo and everything is back to normal.  Not sure why I switched but probably won&#x27;t again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works so well for my husband&#x27;s head!  He cannot do without it.  Thank you for making such a good product.&lt;br /&gt;No more complaints from him.</li>
    <li> At this price, three is more economical and I will always have it on hand.  Wonderful product!  Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair, to cover the grey, a lot of grey, and I have eczema and Psoriasis.  I use this product every time I shampoo, every 2 to 3 days.  One lather up will do it and my hairdresser always comments that the color held up well.  I live in the south, Deep South and in the summer even clean hair can get a little whiffy.  This shampoo prevents whiffy. This product may smell a little strange when using but it will keep your scalp and hair clean and the shampoo smell goes away...just clean and fresh.  I have no problems with flakes or itch if I use this product.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered promptly and works great.  After searching unsuccessfully for a product called Zetar, I looked for the best possible other coal tar shampoo.  Info on Psoria Trax said it contained the maximum strength coal tar available.  I gave it a try, and nearly immediately the flakiness was gone.  Other products I tried, were simply not strong enough to get the job done.  Psoria Trax is strong enough and it got the job done!</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff as a last resort before heading to see a dermatologist. While it did lessen the amount of scaling on my scalp, after about 2 weeks, it was back to the same old problem. Prescription medication ended up being the solution to my problem.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works.  My scalp flakes were very thick.  The first time I let it stay on my scalp for one hour.  After the first washing it did not itch, or flake again.  3 days later I washed again staying on 15 minutes.  Now I wash weekly with psoriatrax to help my scalp heal itself.  I tried many shampoos and this is the only one that worked.  I am so happy it has been years since my scalp was normal.</li>
    <li> Early days yet but since Polytar shampoo became unavailable, my scalp Psoriasis has become a problem. I am on week 1 of using Psoriatrax shampoo and already there is a huge reduction in itching and new eruptions.</li>
    <li> I love the new packaging,  but the product has definitely chgd. The consistency and strength is not as strong. The smell os more fragrant of flowers than tar and the longevity of the shampoo does not last as long as it used to in my daughters hair between shampoos. I will re-purchase because there is no other product that provides this type of relief however I will have to shampoo her hair more frequently now than before.</li>
    <li> Strong solution works well but it is stronger</li>
    <li> This worked OK. I have been using it for several weeks now. It does not complete clear up the eczema on my scalp, but it is better than it was. The only draw back is I have white/silver hair. It is turning my hair light brown in streaks. I may have to find another solution.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all true. I had the WORST psoriasis all across my hairline. Nothing worked. I have battled this for years, but it got worse when I moved to a colder climate.  I almost called in sick one day because I had no way to cover up the terrible psoria-signs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering this has been a great experience. It completely resolved the issue, and since I use it every day, I have not had a recurrence. I will buy this again, and at the time I ordered, this was the best deal on the internet that I could find.</li>
    <li> Works better than the topical steroid solution my dermatologist gave me, and way cheaper!</li>
    <li> I tried all the shelf products on the mkt. Selsun Blue used to have 1% coal tar but they took it out. This is the best dandruff treatment i&#x27;ve ever used. Well worth the price. I assume these enviromental idiots had something to do with having it removed from on the shelf products. Long time ago people used creosote as a dandruff treatment. We need to get back to the old ways of treating these type of things. I highly recommend this shampoo.......</li>
    <li> I have had scalp psoriasis for 25 years and nothing ever helped me, not even prescription shampoos from the dermatologist. Once I used this for about 2 weeks I noticed an incredible improvement. I will only buy this product from now on</li>
    <li> This stuff works! This was my first attempt to clear up my scalp after years of living with what I recently found out was psoriasis. I&#x27;ve been using this 3-4 times a week for less than a month and my scalp is almost cpletely cleared up. This product is amazing. Make sure you follow up use with an ultra moisturizing natural conditioner. This is key for nursing your hair. I highly recommend Giovanni 2chic avacado &amp; oilve oil conditioner.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> For those who grew up with Zetar this is a real help for scalp plaque buildup!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for psoriasis.  Nothing really worked well until I started using this in combination with the Salicylic acid shampoo.  And have had great results.  I continue to use it for maintenance now but no more psoriasis.  Very highly recommend it.  The best ever.</li>
    <li> This is used as part of a treatment of psoriasis on the hands. Not shampoo. So can&#x27;t speak to that but we insert a good pump that fit this bottle except too long and we could cut it to fit just right. It keeps the slightly messy solution confined and works well as a hand soap next to sink. Otherwise he also uses a sterioid ointment by prescription with both it&#x27;s helped the condition a lot. Before the soap not as much. With the pump in the bottle a bottle can actually go quite far. He&#x27;s been on his first bottle for over 5 months now and still has quite a ways to go...has used more than half but still. So we took advantage of the three savings to make sure he doesn&#x27;t run out. I think if you know Coal Tar helps your psoriasis then you might consider giving this a try by going with one bottle first like we did. Just wash the effected area 1-2 times a day with this soap. And if you don&#x27;t want to use a prescription drug or they stop working you might add some of the psoriasis cremes and conditioners out there too. Some people swear they have got off the prescriptions and have better luck with these or switching back and forth when ones system becomes immune to the helping effects which can happen to some people. I definitely would recommend to someone who is having problems.</li>
    <li> great for psoriasis, since using psoriasis are clearing.. thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, use it daily and it keeps everything under control.</li>
    <li> When they discontinued Pentrax a few years ago I thought I&#x27;d never get the relief I&#x27;d enjoyed from that similar product. This is the same formulation and potency.  Not only is it effective on simple dandruff but it&#x27;s a terrific soak for psoriasis in the tub when used my aches and pains subside after a 45 minute bath so sleep is completely uninterrupted.  This is the best soak for that condition out there.</li>
    <li> I have had scalp psoriasis for many years and have tried many remedies.  The one that works with the least negative side effects is a coal tar shampoo with a high percentage of coal tar.  There are other treatments such as steroids and Dovonex that worked, but eventually lost effectiveness and/or developed unacceptable side effects.  I used Pentrax for a long time until the product went off the market, and have been looking for a substitute that was as effective.  This product fits that bill at least for me.</li>
    <li> I used to use Neutrogena Extra Strength, for at least 20 years and was very pleased with it.  Then they started putting the regular strength in the Extra Strength bottles and still calling it Extra Strength.  Anyone who used them could easily tell, because the Extra Strength was much darker and was not scented; the regular strength was heavily scented.  When the &amp;#34;Extra Strength&amp;#34; was lighter and heavily scented, I suspected the company made the financial decision to stop making the Extre Strength, but still wanted those customers to use their product, thus the ruse.  I called the company, but they denied that they had changed the Extra Strength and made it lighter in color and scented it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was then that I started to search for another shampoo, since my scalp psoriasis is difficult to manage.  Psoriatrax did the trick; and infact worked better than the Neutrogena Extra Strength ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;david</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to work with shipper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had severe dandruff/eczema/psoriasis since I was a teenager (i&#x27;m 51 now). When I went to the doctor, he prescribed a coal tar shampoo and told me to leave it on for 15 minutes 3 times a week. 15 minutes is an eternity when you&#x27;re standing in the shower, but it worked. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried every shampoo, but keep coming back to tar-based shampoo because nothing else works. The secret is allowing it to sit on your scalp - especially when you first start to use it - for at least 15 minutes. Use a conditioner after as a moisturizer, and the results after a week will be remarkable.</li>
    <li> It has helped my husbands psoriasis of the scalp immensely. For years his scalp has been red, scaley and inflammed. A friend recommend this product to him and it has been a blessing. It took about a month for his scalp to clear up so don&#x27;t expect results over night and has been clear for almost a year. Needless to say he will be a lifetime customer.</li>
    <li> Started using psoria trax 3 weeks ago for dandruff control so far it seems to be working using psoria trax 2 times per week but in my opinion its not as good as Pentrax was, psoria trax doesn&#x27;t seem to clean hair as good as Pentax did</li>
    <li> Keeps my scalp scale and itch free. It is my shampoo of choice. The big hype...... Coal tar was tested in astronomical concentrations on lab mice, w/ harmful results. What a surprise. Most things used or ingested in extreme concentrations or amounts are going to cause harmful results.&lt;br /&gt;We could use this low dose product every day for the remainder of our lives and not even come close to a tiny concentration of what the poor mice were subjected to.  The FDA needs to concentrate their energies on items that come from unregulated countries and companies.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this is the best coal tar shampoo being sold as an over-the-counter product. Expensive, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This used to be the single best coal tar product available. It was a very clean shampoo that smelled of nothing more than coal tar. Between orders, the formula has changed, The new product, in the opaque white bottles, has a heavy, sickening fragrance. Seriously. The perfume they&#x27;ve used would embarrass a cheap whore. And the fragrance does not wash out with a subsequent washing with an unscented shampoo. It is heavy, and clingy, and follows you around all day. So, if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like you wash with Dollar Store Dish Detergent, this is the shampoo for you! Really sorry to see what was a great product now ruined.</li>
    <li> I am not completely free of the dry flakes but only used shampoo 4 times, and I think it will clear up the problemas I can feel and see the difference.</li>
    <li> Very effective, got psoriasis under control in scalp in about 3 weeks</li>
    <li> The product worked and controlled my scalp condition but at the same time dried out my scalp to the point that it was tight and itchy all the time with major dandruff or dry skin flakes. If you have a severe scalp condition like I do then it will fix the problem no question.&lt;br /&gt;But you must use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner as well. Alternate every second or third night. That fixed the problem with me. I recommend the product but  be sure to moisturize your scalp too and you will have no problems.</li>
    <li> This is the best tar shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  There is another brand that claims to have the same ingredients but it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I have had psoriasis of the scalp for over 20 years. This shampoo is the best that I have ever used.It works just as good as any that my doctor has perscribed. Great product. This is my second order. I got 11 bottles.</li>
    <li> Finally found a product that works! I used to use Zetar until they quit making it. I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked, I tried so many different shampoos with less than favorable results. I bought this product with a lot optimism reading that it contained 5% coal tar like Zetar, and I am not the least bit disappointed. This was my second time of buying three bottles at a time!&lt;br /&gt;I am very grateful to have found a product that really works again!</li>
    <li> This shampoo completely keeps my scalp psoriasis under control, I use it a couple times a week. It really is a life saver. Can&#x27;t say enough how much I depend on, and love this product. Thank you so much for keeping this product in stock and available, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
    <li> Nothing has worked better for me than this product since the discontinuation of Pentax.  Now, I can get some relief from psoriasis again.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product.  It keeps my scalp psoriasis in check when used regularly. Best one I have found yet.</li>
    <li> It now take twice as much shampoo to do what 50% less did before they changed the formula....so, paid 50% more for what you were get before, big back door price increase.  Try it...sure it&#x27;s the same except it takes twice as much!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Best results we&#x27;ve seen after trying several products. Took a few months but all of my hubby&#x27;s scalp flaking has subsided.  Will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Just what my mom wanted</li>
    <li> Shipping was efficient and the product is as advertised. If you liked the old Pentrax, this is an exact equivalent. I am grateful for this product since it&#x27;s the only thing that has controlled the psoriasis.</li>
    <li> For those of you who used to use Zetar.  This product will work as a fill-in shampoo.  You will also need to see your doctor to have them put you on an oil prescription in addition to this shampoo.  Bring back Zetar!</li>
    <li> Have had psoriasis for 35 years and used numerous remedies for scalp treatment.  Coal tar based shampoo has always worked the best in my experience, and the easiest to use, and this is the only product I know of that still uses a therapeutic amount of coal tart in their product to be useful.  (Used to use Denorex, but cannot find tar based formula anymore)  I&#x27;ve tried the numerous salicylic acid shampoos with zero success.</li>
