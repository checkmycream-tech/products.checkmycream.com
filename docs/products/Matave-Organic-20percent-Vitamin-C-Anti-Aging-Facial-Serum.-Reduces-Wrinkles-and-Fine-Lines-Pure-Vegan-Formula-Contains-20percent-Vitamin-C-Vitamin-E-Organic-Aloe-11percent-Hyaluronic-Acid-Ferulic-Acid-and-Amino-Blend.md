<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this so much! I have semi oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or break out. If anything it helps dry my face. I currently sleep with it on.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum! With the dropper, it is super easy to use, and my skin has never felt this soft. It has also helped reduce redness and gives my skin a great glow!</li>
    <li> Been using this for 3 days, so far I&#x27;m loving it!  Makes your skin super soft</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of days and I can honestly say my skin looks brighter and softer! My skin is dry and sensitive and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout from this! I use it twice daily as instructed and my skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Been using it for a week and so far I like it... I put it on after I cleanse my face at night and I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t broken out so I like it :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks &amp; my skin feels amazing!! It absorbs well &amp; brightens my skin. People keep asking me if I have recently gone to a medical.spa for a fancy chemical peel and nope!! It&#x27;s this bottle of fabulousness!!! I will definitely be re ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Great product so far! Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on!</li>
    <li> Great serum. I have been using it for two weeks now. It goes on smoothly and absorbs easily. I especially loves the feeling the next morning, my face is so smooth and growing. I can&#x27;t tell about the wrinkle yet since I don&#x27;t have many but I sure love this serum and would recommend to others. Great product and great company! Thank you!    I received a discount in exchange for an hones, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using it for several days. She said she likes the serum and she felt her skin is more smooth.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product for a long time but so far it has not broken me out yet and that is really a good sign that this product is good for my skin. It doesn&#x27;t make me oily and I can wear it under makeup. It&#x27;s not as sticky as I thought it would be as other serums can get really sticky. I also love the fact that they ship fast!</li>
    <li> To soon to tell, will have to see in a couple of weeks if I see a difference.</li>
    <li> This is such a relief!  I&#x27;ve found so many products to be irritating to the skin on my face - even those who promise me it wont.  This serum actually feels good going on!  I would think that since Vitamin C has anti-inflammatory properties, that this will be the fix to my puffy skin under my eyes.  The dropper application is nice as it is easy to keep the serum from getting contaminated inside the bottle.  The shipping, even in this busy season, was really quick.  The seller must have been quick to send it out after I ordered because it did not take but a few days to get to my home.  I am really looking forward to using this serum on a regular basis and seeing the positive results on my face.  So far, I love everything about this product!</li>
    <li> I am loving this product. Makes my skin feel great and I noticed some of my sunspots have been minimized. I use it every night before bed for the last week and it&#x27;s great. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love love this vitamin serum. After using it for two weeks I can see very noticeable difference in the smoothness of my  face.I put a little of the vitamin c serum on the back  of my hands and they too are softer and smoother and even seems it has taken the sun spots off the back of my hands.Thank you I will be telling friends about this vitamin c serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. :</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottom of Matave 20% Vitamin C serum. It has restored my skin to the way it looked in my 30&#x27;s, after suffering from Lyme Disease for over a decade. I haven&#x27;t been well enough to keep up the skin routine that I had been doing since college and had left me with a great complexion. I literally had abandoned my skin, even to the extent that I couldn&#x27;t always even wash it, much less exfoliate and moisturize. Having dull, aged skin added to the depression of being totally disabled. I finally decided to do SOMETHING for my skin but had to decide on a product that would give me the most benefit from the least amount of effort. After considerable research and trial and error, I found this absolutely wonderful serum. I began to apply it after cleansing twice a day. I was surprised and grateful beyond belief when, at the end of that first bottle, I could look in the mirror again and see myself...not as I was before I became ill, but certainly better than I could have dreamed of. I no longer had dry &amp;#34; sand paper&amp;#34; feeling skin on my forehead, my skin tone was bright and even and clear. Thank you so much, Matave. Your serum has restored not only my skin but also my self esteem...at least a big piece of it. Being disabled and chronically ill is often difficult and lonely as one loses so much. I truly cannot overstate how wonderful this magic serum is in giving me back a piece of myself. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It made my skin feel great! The dropper is very convenient, and I love that it&#x27;s organic and vegan. It&#x27;s nice to know exactly what I&#x27;m putting on my face! Would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great product. Thank u</li>
    <li> Has no odor, absorbs quickly and completely. The components of ingredients are awesome for skin maintenance and I found this not only delivers but does so at a most reasonable and affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;I also found the seller to be most customer conscious in making sure there was customer satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;With the product. This is a rarity in today&#x27;s market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and am back to buy my second bottle.  The packaging is not overly done as with some department store cosmetic counter purchases.  I would much rather receive an effective product than fancy packaging.  I apply to forehead, crow&#x27;s feet and deep lines near my mouth, smoothing the product out to cover my entire face.  I assumed that any application to the deep line on my forehead would be a waste of the product, so imagine my surprise when I realized that this deep line had noticeably improved. I highly recommend this product and will share this personally with my friends.  I did purchase my first bottle with a significant discount for a review, however I have no hesitation in wholeheartedly recommending this product.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;absorbs into the skin quickly, feels hydrating and it softens my skin as well as evens out my skintone.&lt;br /&gt;I use this with my dermal roller.  What a great combo you will feel as if you had a 200$ facial experience with the combination</li>
    <li> This is one of the most effective product I&#x27;ve ever used. This serum has surpassed any other serum I used in the past, expensive brands without any noticeable effect. This serum takes my regular moisturizer to a superior level, it&#x27;s amazing how my skin feels after using this serum, then applying my regular moisturizer, the result is amazing, my skin is much more hydrated, plump, soft and feel refresh. I highly recommend this product, especially for people like me, with mature skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second order. I could see a difference with my skin in a very short time, so reordered immediately.</li>
    <li> I have used this serum for a while now and I do like the fact that it makes my skin feel smoother!  Seriously glad I purchased it and recommend to try it out for yourselves.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff for my skin. After use it, I feel my skin is smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This is the first product of this type that I ever purchased. I got it with a coupon code, so it was very affordable, especially for a first time try. I love that it&#x27;s an organic product, so in not putting crazy chemicals on my skin. That&#x27;s a huge pro. As soon as I put it on, I can start feeling the warmth of the product doing something to my skin. After I apply the serum, my skin is very smooth, and looks great! I do have a Sun shot on my face and hope that this will also diminish the look of that. If it does, this will be a true God send! I hoe tho update my review in the future with more amazing results!</li>
    <li> I recently started using Matave.  It arrived only a few days after ordering.  It&#x27;s easy to use (1 step) and works well under make-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few days now and can start to see a difference. Smells good and a small amount goes along way. Love it!</li>
    <li> My skin soaked this up!  I didn&#x27;t notice any smell at all &amp; it isn&#x27;t sticky like some serums.  The dropper lets you drop 1 drop, which is what you need for one eye, &amp; then go on to your other eye.  The serum doesn&#x27;t all run out in your hand!  I really haven&#x27;t used make-up over it-but I think the make-up would go on just fine! Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks now. My skin just love it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this serum makes my skin feel so soft and radiant. I first use my face wash,toner,then this serum.sometimes under a moisturiser.I am waiting to see a more of a difference in my forehead fine lines. I like to give products more time for that. But overall, I love it and recommend .</li>
    <li> Great product. Skin smooth after using. Thanks.</li>
    <li> works ok with my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, so far she&#x27;s noticed that the product makes the skin on her forehead and around her mouth seem tighter after using.  Keeps her from having to exfoliate as often as well because there&#x27;s less dry skin buildup since she&#x27;s begun using it.  Has a faint medicinal smell, but nothing strong or overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great product. Skin is visibly softer and brighter.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, very nice packaging. The serum leaves my skin very silky, no stickiness. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my complexion does seem brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this item to provide an honest review. The above statements is my unbiased review of the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days now and so far love the fast absorbency and texture of the serum. I have sensitive skin and try to only use all natural and organic skin care products so I am very excited to have found this product! I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin benefits from regular use.</li>
    <li> This product did not do it for me.  I am somewhat familiar how these products work, and have used others that have worked much better.</li>
    <li> Serum works very well, light, and goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a while now and my skin definitely has improved, not so many random red spots and acne scars. However it didn&#x27;t help me to reduce my wrinkles, I am 28 years old and I have some fine lines around my eyes that seem to hard to get rid of. Overall it&#x27;s a very good product, it&#x27;s made in USA, no animals had to suffer, and vegan friendly. You have to remember though that it&#x27;s only good for 12 months.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grandmother. She loves this. She has always been a vitamin c user.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really gotten around to using this product too much, but from what I can tell it absorbs fast, doesn&#x27;t leave an annoying residue, and doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell. Seems like a great product.</li>
    <li> Superb Company! Fast Shipping! Excellent Product!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Matave serum for about a week now and I LOVE how my skin feels a lot smoother and healthier in just a week.  I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a great product that will improve the way their skin looks and feels in a short amount of time!</li>
    <li> My skin just soaks this serum up. It has helped erase fine lines around my eyes and have softened the deep wrinkles. I will continue to keep this product for my skin. I also use InstaNatural The Best Eye Cream that comes in a 1.7 ounce bottle. Using both these products together around my eyes has taken 5 years off my looks. I love it. Recommend to anyone. I also use it all over the rest of my face and it just soaks right in.....and the little dark spots are fading, the wrinkles around my mouth are softer, I want to make sure that I also use the hyurolonic acid product around my eyes and on my face with this serum. So I do not know what this Vit C will do all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;I am 60 y.o. white female and I do believe in this product and will keep and use every day. I think my skin had been screaming for this and now my skin is brighter, lines are gone or softened, dark spots are fading....overall...I am very happy with what I see in the mirror. People ask me what I am using to have such great skin. I love that!</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin felt after apply this serum. It brightened and tightened my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great product, and I love it!</li>
    <li> Matav&amp;eacute;’s 20% Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum was designed to reduce wrinkles, fine lines, sun spots and discoloration, restore and increase collagen formation, and prevent free radicals! Their formulation contains a high concentration of vegan Hyaluronic Acid and an amino blend that will bring you smoother, clearer, more youthful skin. It has awesome key ingredients like Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid and Ferulic Acid that guarantee to bring you the results you need. I love not having to worry about harmful chemicals that can cause more bad than good. It was very easy to use too. All I did was apply the Vitamin C Serum to my face and neck, morning and night, after cleansing and toning. Afterwards, I followed with my usual moisturizer. It didn’t cause me any irritation at all, and I was able to apply my makeup over it with ease. The serum feels great on! There’s no annoying sticky feeling, or any chemical smell. I am very pleased with its quality, and I definitely recommend you check it out! (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> I put this on at night and in the morning, my face looks a lot better. the appearance of my pores are reducing as well as my acne scars. I love this serum.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I bought a derma roller a while back &amp; wanted to get a vitamin C serum to use it with. This serum is Vegan which was really important to me being a vegetarian (&amp; part time vegan). The ingredients are also organic &amp; concentrated. There are no perfumes in there which I always look for...ya I want it to smell good but I dont want to buy a serum for healthy skin &amp; then pack garbage into my pores too just so it smells good! I have noticed a big improvement in my skins health. I have dry skin &amp; I put this on before bed. My skin looks much more luminescent &amp; healthy since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week and my skin already looks fresher. I wasn&#x27;t used to using a dropper but I worker out the best method to use the serum. A little goes a long way! I use this under my moisturizer and makeup just fine. I like that they use organic ingredients, which is important to me. The smell seemed strong the first time I used it but I don&#x27;t even notice anymore.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start off with the cons first, since there is pretty much nothing bad about this high-quality serum, and then get to the good stuff afterwards!    Cons:  - Smell is a bit stronger and harsher than the light and pleasant cosmetic fragrances I am used to  - Comes with a syringe for application, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences (I personally like pumps for easier and more convenient application)    Pros:  - Highly absorbent, which is great because you don&#x27;t have to wait around for it to dry as you would with a moisturizer, for example  - Applies and absorbs just like tree tea oil. If you have used tea tree oil before, you will find that you can dab this on and it will absorb in a very similar fashion  - Multi-purpose uses. I previously used an anti-aging serum in addition to Philosophy&#x27;s retinol night cream, but this serum in particular has made my skin look a lot more radiant in such a short time that I no longer feel the need to use Philosophy&#x27;s retinol cream anymore  - No irritation whatsoever. My skin is extremely sensitive so I usually am cautious of what I put on my skin, but this serum went on perfectly and did nothing but good things for my face  - Helps improve skin tone. My main concern is acne blemishes - I haven&#x27;t seen my actual blemishes go down as a result of this serum (or maybe because I keep drinking soda), but I have noticed that the discolored area around my blemishes have turned back to my normal skin color. Very happy about this, because I hadn&#x27;t been able to treat it with tea tree oil!    Overall, a great purchase, especially because its many uses will definitely allow you to replace some of the products in your beauty routine with just this serum.

    <li> .My grandma loves it. She is currently using both day and night.</li>
    <li> I love how it dry quick &amp; tighten the skin. After after put it on I put a moisturizer on top. My face looks amazing. My skin looks evenly town and more smooth. Making me look younger.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant but very refreshing. I wear it under my moisturizer. I really wish the scent would go with the feel. I believe it would make an overall difference</li>
    <li> Love this anti aging Vitamin C serum! Ingredients are organic and include vitamin C, hydraulic acid and amino acids. The serum is applied with an eyedropper for convenience. A few drops goes a long way! I love the way this serum makes my skin feel soft and supple.  This is the third bottle that I have purchased and have been pleased by my reduced wrinkles and brown age spots. Give this product a try… You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive my serum and even happier with the results especially as its all natural. It has a very clean feel and very easy to use. I feel that my skin is more supple since using it and has a glow as well! The seller was super fast with the delivery and professional. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great for holiday gift. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> it happens allergy seriously on my face the first time i use, then i stop using it for quite long time. Currently, i mix them with hand cream and use it on my hand. Everything great now. The reason to give product 4 star instead 5 star because the allergy had every happened on me, and its better the other users could aware it could happen. Excellent seller, perfect service, super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it gives smooth ans soft sensation to my face after a thin layer application.  Only needing small amount to get good effect, and the 2oz bottle can definitely lasts me a while.  Good buy for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!</li>
