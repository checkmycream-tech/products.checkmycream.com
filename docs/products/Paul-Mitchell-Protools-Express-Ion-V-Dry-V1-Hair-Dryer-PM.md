      <li>I love love love this dryer!  </li>
      <li>I always thought it was the magic of my hair stylist.  </li>
      <li>To say I love this blow dryer is an understatement.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>ANYTHING Paul Mitchell is Fabulous!  </li>
      <li>I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong today</li>
      <li>With that being said, the V.1 dryer is for us folks with fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It was working fine until today, when this one started sparking too.  </li>
      <li>I have strait, but a lot of fine texture hair.  </li>
      <li>It dries your hair fairly quickly, but my hairdresser suggested that this dryer is probably more suited for salon/occassional use rather than home/everyday use.  </li>
      <li>I also confirmed it is a V.1 dryer on the Paul Mitchell site.</li>
      <li>She was happy to receive the present.</li>
      <li>If they read the product description, the V.2 is probably more suitable for that hair type, not the V.1, which clearly states &amp;#34;for fine hair&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>It may be pricey, but I believe it is worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>it is definetly worth the investment!</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>This is a really nice blow dryer not loud and easy to use!</li>
      <li>when you press the cool button it holds for you - you do not have to hold it in.  </li>
      <li>This blow dryer had good reviews and was purchased for the low noise level for my wife.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, quiet blow dryer.  </li>
      <li>but it was worth it</li>
      <li>Fast drying time and lightweight!  </li>
      <li>last thing that I love about this dryer -</li>
      <li>Blowdrying on the low setting takes about 30-50% longer, but my hair looks so much better.</li>
      <li>I thought at first that it was a safety feature, but then it started sparking out the nozzle.  </li>
      <li>If you look on the paul mitchell website, it says that this blowdryer is ideal for fine hair, there is another dryer that is recommended for thick hair, it is called the express ion dry TURBOLIGHT.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the money for the high quality.</li>
      <li>, it really has turned out to be an investment on my hair.   </li>
      <li>I was nervous to spend so much money on a blowdryer</li>
      <li>All along while I was using it, the heat would cut out and would blow cool air in the middle of drying.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend highly to anyone who want a quality hair dryer.</li>
      <li>hair is dried quicker, quieter, softer, frizz free!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quiet and powerful.</li>
      <li>I received my replacement, a brand new dryer, about 2 weeks ago.  </li>
      <li>I hope it lasts long to make it worth the money.  </li>
      <li>And it dried my hair super fast.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping by purchasing this dryer I could achieve the same results, and I can say with confidence that this mission was accomplished.</li>
      <li>It works as advertised and is quite for such a fast drying blow dryer.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, silky, shiny, and bouncy - just as if my hair stylist did it for me every day.  </li>
      <li>and it dries my hair in record time leaving it soft and pliable.  </li>
      <li>The cool button is in an odd place, though.  </li>
      <li>this product is not great it started to spark and and it doesn&#x27;t sound the same as when I first opened it.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes the extra long cord that it is equipped with.</li>
      <li>I thought he was pulling my leg when he began to dry my hair after coloring with his new \\&quot;Paul Mitchell Ionic Hair</li>
      <li>This blowdryer gets very hot, I would definately give your hair about a 70 percent \\&quot;rough dry\\&quot; before you start using the round brush with the concentrater.  </li>
      <li>I rarely ever use the low setting because the air flow isn&#x27;t that hard</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have wavy/curly hair that I straighten.  I use Purology products and take great care to \\&quot;protect\\&quot; from heat damage.  When drying the front of my hair, the dryer actually burned my hair and broke it off.  It was partly my fault due to having the dryer too close to the brush.  Now I have bangs when I didn&#x27;t before because my hair was still wrapped around the brush when I was pulling out the curl.      It dries your hair fairly quickly, but my hairdresser suggested that this dryer is probably more suited for salon/occassional use rather than home/everyday use.  Its too hard on your hair.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is by far the best I have ever used.  It arrived really fast - which is totally awesome.  If you want a blow dryer that does NOT make your hair dry, frizzy, or crunchy (all from a dryer ruining your hair), then this is the dryer for you.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, quiet blow dryer.  It has cut the drying time for my long hair by 10 minutes.  The cool button is in an odd place, though.  I keep hitting it when I hold the dryer to use it.  I hope it lasts long to make it worth the money.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> My stylist used to teach at Paul Mitchell&#x27;s school.  I thought he was pulling my leg when he began to dry my hair after coloring with his new \\&quot;Paul Mitchell Ionic Hair Dryer\\&quot;.  He said it would make my hair silky and shiny - and being the doubting thomas that I am, thought it was a crock.  Well, lo and behold, what a difference!  Usually after coloring, my hair is dry and crisp.  Not this time.  And it dried my hair super fast.  I&#x27;m ordering one for myself today!</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell Pro Tools Express Ion Hair Dryer is the Best I have ever used!  My salon uses it so I decided to buy so I can get better results! -My hair usually takes a long time to dry and then frizzes after--! Not with this hair dryer -my hair is dried quicker, quieter, softer, frizz free!  it is definetly worth the investment! I have friends and family who have noticed a difference! this product is #1...</li>
    <li> My hairstylist uses this dryer, so I bought one. I have to use my flat iron less and my hair is so shiny! I use a flat paddle brush (not bristles), I blow dry on the low setting, and finish off with a blast of cold air on my part to keep the flyaways under control. Blowdrying on the low setting takes about 30-50% longer, but my hair looks so much better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a few months ago.  All along while I was using it, the heat would cut out and would blow cool air in the middle of drying.  I thought at first that it was a safety feature, but then it started sparking out the nozzle.  I returned it, thinking I had just gotten a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot;.  I received my replacement, a brand new dryer, about 2 weeks ago.  It was working fine until today, when this one started sparking too.  My daughter burned her hair.  I also noticed that it is not UL listed, which makes me very uncomfortable.  I will be returning it for a refund and will be reporting it to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.</li>
    <li> This item wasn&#x27;t for me, but it got there in a timely manner and in good shape.</li>
    <li> ANYTHING Paul Mitchell is Fabulous!  Love this hair dryer!  Would easily purchase it for family and friends!  Heathy for your hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair dryer.  Works great and does a super job.  Would recommend highly to anyone who want a quality hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice blow dryer not loud and easy to use! A little pricey but it was worth it</li>
    <li> this product is not great it started to spark and and it doesn&#x27;t sound the same as when I first opened it. I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer! It&#x27;s quiet and powerful. I love how it makes my hair feel. I bought it over a year ago and I use it a few times a week and it&#x27;s still going strong. I think it&#x27;s worth the money for the high quality.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best blowdryer I have ever owned. I bought the diffuser to go with it and my my curls have never been curlier.  I was nervous to spend so much money on a blowdryer but after having it for the last few month, I cant imagine living without it, it really has turned out to be an investment on my hair.   This blowdryer gets very hot, I would definately give your hair about a 70 percent \\&quot;rough dry\\&quot; before you start using the round brush with the concentrater.  If you look on the paul mitchell website, it says that this blowdryer is ideal for fine hair, there is another dryer that is recommended for thick hair, it is called the express ion dry TURBOLIGHT.</li>
    <li> To say I love this blow dryer is an understatement.  I regularly get my hair done at a Paul Mitchell salon, and my hair stylist uses this same hair dryer.  I always feel like a million dollars when I leave.  My hair looks bouncy, shiny, and simply amazing.  I always thought it was the magic of my hair stylist.  However, after my hair dryer died last weekend, I decided to make an investment.  I was hoping by purchasing this dryer I could achieve the same results, and I can say with confidence that this mission was accomplished. I will never purchase anything other than a Paul Mitchell product again.  I am completely surprised there are not more reviews for this dryer, which is part of why I was hesitant to purchase. My hair is soft, silky, shiny, and bouncy - just as if my hair stylist did it for me every day.  I am going to say that although this is listed as V.1, it does not say that on the box or the dryer itself, but it does list it as V.1 on the instructions in the box.  I also confirmed it is a V.1 dryer on the Paul Mitchell site. With that being said, the V.1 dryer is for us folks with fine hair.  I have strait, but a lot of fine texture hair.  I read someone else&#x27;s review that they used it on their thick, wavy, curly hair and it was horrible.  If they read the product description, the V.2 is probably more suitable for that hair type, not the V.1, which clearly states &amp;#34;for fine hair&amp;#34;.  So please keep that in mind.  I hope my review helps someone decide on this dryer.  It may be pricey, but I believe it is worth every penny!  One last thing that I love about this dryer - when you press the cool button it holds for you - you do not have to hold it in.  This is key if you want to close the hair cuticle, lock in your style and shine.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> The Paul Mitchell Pro tools Express Ion Dryer was an xmas gift for my daughter. She was happy to receive the present.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer had good reviews and was purchased for the low noise level for my wife. The other blow dryers are too loud even with the door closed. It works as advertised and is quite for such a fast drying blow dryer. My wife really likes the extra long cord that it is equipped with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for 5 years! I got it in hair school and it&#x27;s still going strong today where I blow dry every 30 minutes. It&#x27;s really quiet too. I rarely ever use the low setting because the air flow isn&#x27;t that hard but like I said, I&#x27;ve had it for over 5 years.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve owned.  I have mid length thick coarse hair and it dries my hair in record time leaving it soft and pliable.  Pretty impressed!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this Paul Mitchell Pro Tools Express Ion Dry V.1 hair dryer.  I bought my first one about 4 years ago and it worked wonderfully.  Fast drying time and lightweight!  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love love love this dryer!  My stylist purchased one for me a few years ago and when it broke I was bummed.  My hair was fuzzier, dryer looking, and seemed unmanageable when I made a purchase for one at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for a \\&quot;better\\&quot; quality one than Meijer&#x27;s, but it still was a standard dryer that I hated using. I went on Amazon and was pleased to spend the money for the quality of the Paul Mitchell Dryer! I will never go back.</li>
