### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I used it before and it worked real good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with this Overnight Repair Cream.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been so impressed with this product</li>
      <li>This is a very good skin product.</li>
      <li>great feel and scent</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>It is a very nice moisturizer.</li>
      <li>In a weeks time the difference was simply AMAZING!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not good.</li>
      <li>But, I feel the overnight cream is the superior product of the three.  </li>
      <li>I waited until I finished the jar to form my opinion of this product; I wanted to give it a fair shot.</li>
      <li>For the cost, I think I&#x27;ll stick with the lower cost product that does an equally good job.</li>
      <li>Does a good job moisturizing but has it removed any lines or wrinkles?  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There are no results to report, i.e. she says there are no visible signs of improvement, although her skin feels good upon application.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Best of all it absorbs right into the skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very impressive product that I definitely enjoyed using and that my skin appreciated greatly.</li>
      <li>I find the cream to absorb into the skin nicely, leaving no residue on sheets or pillows.  </li>
      <li>Maybe if you lived in the desert all your life and had never done anything nice for your skin before, you would see a dermatalogical revolution in a week or two, but for me the changes are incremental at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>Hydroxatone&#x27;s aggressive TV ads kind of turned me off.</li>
      <li>I really lucked out with this product, because i have never found something so perfect for my skin.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say that I can&#x27;t tell any sort of difference that it&#x27;s made.</li>
      <li>I shelved my bottle of Oil of Olay thinking that this would certainly do something impressive and exciting for my skin.</li>
      <li>love the texture.</li>
      <li>but with none of the thickness that I noticed when it was on my finger - great, because it meant I had applied too much</li>
      <li>I think I look better too.  </li>
      <li>On top of that I had an itch on my cheek</li>
      <li>Since I started using this cream, I like what I see in the mirror more than I have for years.</li>
      <li>But that didn&#x27;t happen and each week has been better and better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it each night and I will purchase this cream when I need more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is always best to go to a make-up counter and test several brands.  </li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>The thing I love the most about the Hydroxatone products is the lack of fragrances.  </li>
      <li>I have used many many lotions on my face, many creams, many serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>cream is great for skin types that really thirst for moisture.</li>
      <li>Love this product and I have reordered on a number of occasions.  </li>
      <li>wrinkles from happening, just make sure you give your nose a break every so often.</li>
      <li>That said, if I am going to spend a lot of money on moisturizer, I will spend a bit more and get Strivectin.</li>
      <li>I also tried the neck cream in this brand, and the smell was so overwhelming</li>
      <li>I also love that it has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love how this cream makes my face look and feel but as for wrinkles I&#x27;m using this to prevent them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Potent anti-oxidant)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With skin tightening, it basically is preventing the skin from stretching at night so that those wrinkles are not getting deeper and more noticeable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know if you will find this as interesting</li>
      <li>My wife has told me the lines do not seem so pronounced and that I look better.  </li>
      <li>- The cream has a nice rich consistency that smooths on easily.</li>
      <li>I have really dry skin, so this stuff is probably best for my skin</li>
      <li>Refreshingly, the odor is quite neutral, rather like cortisone cream in its very mild scent.</li>
      <li>The packaging is gorgeous, modern and says luxury to the eye.</li>
      <li>Women want to seem like they look gorgeous without any effort and going to bed looking like a clown isnt very mysterious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice product, not too greasy, easily absorbed.</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of moisturizers over the years, and HYDROXATONE INTENSIVE OVERNIGHT REPAIR CREAM is a pretty nice one.  </li>
      <li>It looks fine, but not dramatically improved.</li>
      <li>It feels more like a lotion than a cream (i.e. feels like it has more water in it), but this is just a pretty subjective tactile observation, not any indicator of performance or quality.</li>
      <li>on smooth, not oily at all and absorbs 99 percent at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and completely, easy to apply, has a very mild scent, and leaves you feeling softer and firmer in the morning...</li>
      <li>away fine lines and significantly repaired deeper ones;&lt;br /</li>
      <li>It feels good going on, is not heavy or greasy, and best of all it didn&#x27;t leave my pillow a mess!</li>
      <li>While it may not be right for everyone, HYDROXATONE INTENSIVE OVERNIGHT REPAIR CREAM sure works for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>It is light-weight, non-greasy, goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles yet, but my skin certainly seems more evened out and moistured when I wake up in the morning.</li>
      <li>large pores look a lot better though so</li>
      <li>If your sense of smell is really acute, you will perceive a very minimal kind of chemical odor.</li>
      <li>As with most skin creams, even the best ones, a month is a relatively short period of time to tell a difference, especially if you were already taking reasonably good care of your skin with other products before uou started to use HIRORC.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First off I ask of any overnight cream, that it absorbs quickly into my skin and this does.</li>
      <li>It has the perfect weight for a night cream, with intense hydration without a heavy feeling.</li>
      <li>Nothing new works better.</li>
      <li>To me, definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Under the eyes, there is more health in the skin, and no dark spots.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>/&gt;I started to see a difference right away.</li>
      <li>Speeds up the skin&#x27;s own cell turnover process, the process by which fresh, new young skin cells come to the surface - so you wake up with refreshed skin in the morning.</li>
      <li>It applies smoothly, does not offend even my relatively sensitive skin, is absorbed quickly, and feels non-greasy.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t even able to use it long enough to see any type of effects to be honest.</li>
      <li>This product worked for the first week, then it caused my combination skin to break out.</li>
      <li>but i think it loses effect after awhile, although worked great at first.</li>
      <li>I have found Hydroxatone to be lightweight and not too greasy; its light scent doesn&#x27;t seem to affect my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Since I spend most of each day working outside</li>
      <li>so  much that I will consider buying it when I run out, which won&#x27;t be for a WHILE now and that alone makes it worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the others do help with the overall appearance as well.</li>
      <li>I saw no visible difference after more than a month&#x27;s use and have decided to go back to my Oil of Olay.</li>
      <li>At first, that worried me.</li>
      <li>do feel it on my face for the first minute or two after I put it on.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few weeks now and can already see my face looking more youthful and refreshed when I wake up, and that is an insomniac&#x27;s wildest dream come TRUE!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unlike other products of this kind, this cream has almost no smell.</li>
      <li>I like Hydroxatone products in general, and this Overnight Repair Cream is fine.  </li>
      <li>But on the positive side, it dissipates in about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>pretty much as advertised - what could be better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>By simply applying a light layer to my freshly washed face at bedtime, my face began to even out color, lose some fine lines and look years younger.</li>
      <li>Now, after a month--and less than half the jar used--I am really impressed by the improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>It goes on well, absorbs quickly and does not irritate my sometimes sensitive mid-40s skin.  </li>
      <li>skin does feel fine in the morning, and everything is properly moisturized.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little tingly, almost warm.</li>
      <li>It refreshed the skin on my face so much that I tried it on my forearms,</li>
      <li>She says it \\&quot;works really</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to keep using Hydraxatone Intensive Overnight Repair Cream because it really works for</li>
      <li>The odor is so minimal that most people will not even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wanted to try this product for quite sometime and was so looking forward to having it and seeing the effects.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it.  I&#x27;ve been using if for over 2 years.  I tried other products for a while, but I&#x27;m back to this.  Nothing new works better.</li>
    <li> Have seen a big difference in the texture of my skin, lessening of wrinkles</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to make a decision but so far it makes my skin feel very smoothe.  Not sure it&#x27;s actually minimizing fine lines</li>
    <li> I love how this cream makes my face look and feel but as for wrinkles I&#x27;m using this to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;My large pores look a lot better though so yay. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;So am not sure if it works one wrinkles if u have them. -_-&#x27;</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t do anything but make my face look very oily. So I stop using it.I was disappointed, but maybe it wasn&#x27;t for my skin type.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than Oil of Olay or other over the counter products.</li>
    <li> Can not see the results yet, since it was only a few weeks since I started to use it this time. I used it before and it worked real good.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed as I thought I was purchasing a new, unused jar. Was boxed but contained very little actual product. Personally, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; jars of facial cream.  Thank you for asking.</li>
    <li> This is a very good skin product. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> great feel and scent but i think it loses effect after awhile, although worked great at first. but way too expensive for a regular in my beauty arsenal.</li>
    <li> Nice product, not too greasy, easily absorbed. Sure does soften and moisturize, only time will tell if it works on these old wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love this product and I have reordered on a number of occasions.  Small container, but contents last a long time using it at bedtime.</li>
    <li> after a month of use there was no improvement or change</li>
    <li> In just 3 days time, I could start to see a big difference. In a weeks time the difference was simply AMAZING! By simply applying a light layer to my freshly washed face at bedtime, my face began to even out color, lose some fine lines and look years younger. I had friends and family remark at how young and radiant I was looking!</li>
    <li> This product worked for the first week, then it caused my combination skin to break out. I had to stop using the product in order to clear up my skin. I did not appreciate having acne again at my age. be ware this clogs pores</li>
    <li> Some night creams leave your skin feeling weighted down and slightly greasy. This product does not. It has the perfect weight for a night cream, with intense hydration without a heavy feeling. I have definitely noticed a difference in my dry winter skin since using this overnight. Scent is unnoticeable, a definite plus. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this overnight cream.  It is kind of thick and covers with just a small amount.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  My skin feels really soft after using it.  I have used it about one month and can see a difference in the wrinkles around my mouth.  They are definitely not as pronounced.  It seems as if they are softened.  They are not totally gone mind you, just less noticeable.  The thing I love the most about the Hydroxatone products is the lack of fragrances.  There is NO FRAGRANCE!  There are few products out there that I can say that about.  I will add that I am using the daily moisture cream and exfoliating cream along with this overnight cream.  But, I feel the overnight cream is the superior product of the three.  I&#x27;m sure the others do help with the overall appearance as well.</li>
    <li> I like Hydroxatone products in general, and this Overnight Repair Cream is fine.  It goes on well, absorbs quickly and does not irritate my sometimes sensitive mid-40s skin.  The cream is quite light with a texture that is a cross between a cream and a gel.  There is little to no fragrance, which is preferable to me especially at bedtime.  My skin did feel well moisturized in the morning but I did not see any \\&quot;repair\\&quot; benefits after four weeks of constant use.  Given the relatively high price, I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I used it exactly twice: first time it left the skin with slightly stinging sensation and caused redness and a breakout--last time I had one was more than 20 years ago; second time the stinging sensation was worse and the skin stayed red and irritated for over 2 weeks. Down the trashcan it went. I should have not used it second time, I was just in disbelief that such an expensive product can cause so much damage.</li>
    <li> For the main points, let&#x27;s start with the constituent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage 6.5/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying to your face, I noticed the ever present face-tightening. It seems to be something in common with Hydroxatone products, and after your face tightens, it looks a bit shinier and not as flushed. To me it seems that this keeps the skin from sagging too much (which is what may cause wrinkles). Skin sagging is natural with age as the cells break down over time moreover; have you ever noticed what happens to skin, or most things, when stretched for long periods of time? They permanently get longer and sometimes cause little tears. With skin tightening, it basically is preventing the skin from stretching at night so that those wrinkles are not getting deeper and more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell 4/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good. Hard to take in through the nostrils for long periods of time. With this product recommended to be used at night, you will have warn everyone your bed--including yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said previously, I noticed the effect it had on my skin insofar as it was effecting the &#x27;feeling&#x27; of it. Whether or not I can tell a difference visually is different from the previous sentiment because I have noticed nothing substantial so far. As the philosophy about stretching objects go--at least this can potentially &#x27;prevent&#x27; anymore wrinkles from happening, just make sure you give your nose a break every so often.</li>
    <li> I waited until the entire bottle of the product was used up to leave a review. I&#x27;m very impressed with this Overnight Repair Cream. It offers an intense moisture boost that lasts all night long. For people whose skin is dry and who suffer during the heating season from an excessive loss of moisture that leaves them itchy, this product is phenomenal. I don&#x27;t think I would use it during the summer season when my skin doesn&#x27;t need as much moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is great for skin types that really thirst for moisture. A very small amount suffices to nourish the facial skin, so one bottle of the product lasts a while. If your skim is on the oily side, however, I&#x27;m afraid this cream might be too heavy for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other products of this kind, this cream has almost no smell. If your sense of smell is really acute, you will perceive a very minimal kind of chemical odor. But on the positive side, it dissipates in about 30 minutes. The odor is so minimal that most people will not even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very impressive product that I definitely enjoyed using and that my skin appreciated greatly.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I am too young yet to fully appreciate this product, although I do use their undereye treatment lotion.  I have found Hydroxatone to be lightweight and not too greasy; its light scent doesn&#x27;t seem to affect my sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles yet, but my skin certainly seems more evened out and moistured when I wake up in the morning.</li>
    <li> Having not found any products to try out and review myself, I thought I&#x27;d get something for my mom to try.  So, this is from her perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She found that it wasn&#x27;t very different from other moisturizers she&#x27;s tried: creamy, goes on smoothly, too light for a night cream (dries too quickly, not staying on the skin long enough to &#x27;repair&#x27;), and whipped for volume.  She says there is a very slight tingle when putting it on and a very faint smell, but the smell is an inoffensive chemical smell.  One 1-oz. jar has lasted approximately 3 months and there is still some left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no results to report, i.e. she says there are no visible signs of improvement, although her skin feels good upon application.  She hasn&#x27;t had any skin irritations or breakouts while using Hydroxatone Intensive Overnight Repair Cream and so she assumes the product is non-clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She recommends Cetaphil as a low-cost option over Hydroxatone, though in her words, \\&quot;This certainly isn&#x27;t a bad product.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I find the cream to absorb into the skin nicely, leaving no residue on sheets or pillows.  Does a good job moisturizing but has it removed any lines or wrinkles?  Not that I can tell.</li>
    <li> I am not a person to spend a ton of money on beauty products because I don&#x27;t wear makeup in the first place, so this was a total delight to try. The first thing I noticed when I applied it was it&#x27;s thick, creamy, texture that went on my face smoothly as butter - but with none of the thickness that I noticed when it was on my finger - great, because it meant I had applied too much and it would last even longer than I had first imagined. It gives your face a silky, protective coating that makes you feel like a movie star! Best of all it absorbs right into the skin so you don&#x27;t have the hideous cold cream and curlers look that is a husband&#x27;s worst nightmare. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few weeks now and can already see my face looking more youthful and refreshed when I wake up, and that is an insomniac&#x27;s wildest dream come TRUE! I love this product so  much that I will consider buying it when I run out, which won&#x27;t be for a WHILE now and that alone makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s terrible. It is fake Gydroxatone.  It smell funny and strange color.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I can honestly say that I can&#x27;t tell any sort of difference that it&#x27;s made. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much different than my previous Olay moisterizer. For the cost, I think I&#x27;ll stick with the lower cost product that does an equally good job.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Hydroxatone Intensive Overnight Repair Cream for a couple of weeks at my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - The cream has a nice rich consistency that smooths on easily. It moisturizes the skin and your face appears noticeably more refreshed after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - The cream smells clay-like and if you have sensitive skin it may get red after a couple of uses. The person in our family with sensitive skin switched to every second day and was then able to use the product without incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t normally have issue with face creams this product may be for you. If you have sensitive skin, you may want to take that into account when purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Hydroxatone Intensive Overnight Repair Cream deligently each night on the crow&#x27;s feet at the outer corners of my eyes and the lines under my eyes.  Please note:  I am a man and have a beard, so around my eyes are my only problem areas which needed the attention of a repair cream.  My wife has told me the lines do not seem so pronounced and that I look better.  I think I look better too.  Since I spend most of each day working outside I appreciate how this cream makes my skin look and feel softer.  I will continue to use it each night and I will purchase this cream when I need more.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream nightly every since I received it and I like the way it feels on my face.  It soaks in during the night and the next morning, my face is soft and appears to have fewer wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Wrinkles aren&#x27;t getting worse but hoping for more improvement.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of money on an &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; product for my facial skin from a beauty salon, and it actually made my skin break out!  I found that all Hydroxatone skin creams make my skin feel grateful and they are non-greasy and yet feel nourishing, with no adverse skin affects.</li>
    <li> I have used many many lotions on my face, many creams, many serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so different about this one? Well so far its doing what it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off I ask of any overnight cream, that it absorbs quickly into my skin and this does. Who wants a lotioned up pillow, or even worse going to get frisky with your hubby and apologizing for not being able to nuzzle me because my face is so greasy. Women want to seem like they look gorgeous without any effort and going to bed looking like a clown isnt very mysterious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, after a few weeks now of using this, I can see that its reducing fine lines, giving radiance to my face, It feels like its rejuvenating my skin. I also use this on my neck, because people tend to forget the delicate places arent just on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has almost no scent, which I appreciate, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have never tried anything like this cream.  I have tried night creams in the past, and would wake up with my face sticking to my pillow case, and having to wash it.  This stuff just disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been told that nothing you apply topically can make any difference, but this cream has changed my mind about that idea.  I have really dry skin, so this stuff is probably best for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are younger, have oily skin, or pimples or eruptions, i would get a lighter formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is always best to go to a make-up counter and test several brands.  I really lucked out with this product, because i have never found something so perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> The Hydroxatone Intensive Repair Overnight Repair Cream (hereafter HIRORC) is obviously a quality product. It applies smoothly, does not offend even my relatively sensitive skin, is absorbed quickly, and feels non-greasy. Refreshingly, the odor is quite neutral, rather like cortisone cream in its very mild scent. If you like skin cream to smell like a bouquet, this is not for you, but this is fine by me as more often than not, the manufacturer&#x27;s efforts to create a gentle natural smell go horribly astray, and you end up with something that smells artificial and overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin does feel fine in the morning, and everything is properly moisturized. Pores are clear. However, after roughly a month of use, I cannot claim that my skin looks a decade younger than it is. It looks fine, but not dramatically improved. As with most skin creams, even the best ones, a month is a relatively short period of time to tell a difference, especially if you were already taking reasonably good care of your skin with other products before uou started to use HIRORC. Maybe if you lived in the desert all your life and had never done anything nice for your skin before, you would see a dermatalogical revolution in a week or two, but for me the changes are incremental at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a longer term, due to its other apparent signs of quality, I feel this cream might well offer excellent performance - but at a not insignificant price! Note that 3.2 oz appears to last for maybe 3 months or thereabouts, so factor that into the pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the cream does not feel especially thick or luxurious, being noticeably thinner than say Nivea. It feels more like a lotion than a cream (i.e. feels like it has more water in it), but this is just a pretty subjective tactile observation, not any indicator of performance or quality.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of moisturizers over the years, and HYDROXATONE INTENSIVE OVERNIGHT REPAIR CREAM is a pretty nice one.  It is light-weight, non-greasy, goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly.  There is no real scent to this cream, and you only need a small amount (which is great considering the price).  When used at night, my skin is definitely softer, smoother, and well hydrated in the morning.  The little fine lines are less noticeable, the over all tone of my skin is a little firmer, which is very nice at my age!  AND my husband actually mentioned that my skin seemed to glow!  Woo hoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I do have sensitive skin, but HYDROXATONE INTENSIVE OVERNIGHT REPAIR CREAM does not seem to affect it.  There is a slight tingly sensation when first applied, but it does not bother me.  Since it is labelled as \\&quot;intensive,\\&quot; I only use this cream every other night, so perhaps this is why it works so well for me and does not irritate my skin.  AND, when I sunburned my face, HYDROXATONE INTENSIVE OVERNIGHT REPAIR CREAM seemed to sooth, not irritate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall HYDROXATONE INTENSIVE OVERNIGHT REPAIR CREAM does everything I ask for in a night cream.  While it may not be right for everyone, HYDROXATONE INTENSIVE OVERNIGHT REPAIR CREAM sure works for me.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and completely, easy to apply, has a very mild scent, and leaves you feeling softer and firmer in the morning...pretty much as advertised - what could be better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback I can see is that it&#x27;s a tad on the expensive side. Still, a little goes a long way - the 1oz. jar should last most people several months. To me, definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Back when I was a teenager, my grandmother had me start using Oil of Olay. At that time there were two types, daytime, which was light pink, and nighttime, which was thicker.  I used both for years, but as I matured, and had more money to spend, I switched to more expensive creams, and still use them.  I tried this thinking it would be highly moisturizing and a miracle cream (I know, they don&#x27;t exist....)  This is the basic nighttime cream you could have bought anywhere in the 80s for less than eight dollars.  I&#x27;m not impressed, and I won&#x27;t bother with it again.  I also tried the neck cream in this brand, and the smell was so overwhelming, I couldn&#x27;t use more than a few times.</li>
    <li> It refreshed the skin on my face so much that I tried it on my forearms, that have been dry like a desert the last 2 years, and the result was instant and astoundingly wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now ordered this as gifts for my sisters. The packaging is gorgeous, modern and says luxury to the eye. A terrific find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth, not oily at all and absorbs 99 percent at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if you will find this as interesting but I went to the website and got the list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chronogen(tm) (Highly specialized Tetrapeptide that works with the bodies&#x27; natural nighttime repair processes.Glucosamine HCL &amp; Algae Extract &amp; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract.

    <li> I waited until I finished the jar to form my opinion of this product; I wanted to give it a fair shot. It is a very nice moisturizer. It feels good going on, is not heavy or greasy, and best of all it didn&#x27;t leave my pillow a mess! That said, if I am going to spend a lot of money on moisturizer, I will spend a bit more and get Strivectin. Or spend quite a bit less and stick with the Olay Regenerist line, which seemed the most comparable to me of the products I&#x27;ve tried - and it is less than half the price.</li>
    <li> I noticed a different in the softness and elasticity of my skin within a week for using this miracle cream.  I have been using it for approximately a month and my face is much less dry (a common problem I have had in the past).  Just a dab will cover my face and neck so I expect the product to last approximately 4 to 6 months, which is good considering the price.  The lotion really has no scent which is just what I would want when using at night.  I am a believer in this stuff.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. I used during day without problems.</li>
    <li> I shelved my bottle of Oil of Olay thinking that this would certainly do something impressive and exciting for my skin. I mean, it&#x27;s many times more expensive than what I normally use and you know you get what you pay for, right? Nope - not this time. I found nothing really changed with my nearly half century skin. I saw no visible difference after more than a month&#x27;s use and have decided to go back to my Oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try this product for quite sometime and was so looking forward to having it and seeing the effects. I was sadly disappointed. I wasn&#x27;t even able to use it long enough to see any type of effects to be honest. It all came down to the ickyness it left on my face. I use a small amount (less than dime size) and spread it evenly all over my face, circulating it throughout. Within a few minutes I felt like I had greasy stuff on my forehead. When I looked in the mirror I looked like a shiny Christmas ornament. Now that wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal because it IS a nighttime treatment after all so no one is going to see you like that out in public. The problem is it actually left residue on my pillow! On top of that I had an itch on my cheek and when I scratched I came away with gunk on my finger! Ew is all I can say. I couldn&#x27;t get past a third night of using this.</li>
    <li> My wife has informed for this review that the overnight repair cream is indeed working as expected. She has used a variety of such products in the past, and this one does meet all expectations for a high end cream. There is no sticky or residue feeling overnight, or anything on the face that needs to be cleaned up. The skin does appear healthier and gives confidence. Under the eyes, there is more health in the skin, and no dark spots. It is very similar to other good quality creams out there, and is justifiable for the price.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I ordered this product. Hydroxatone&#x27;s aggressive TV ads kind of turned me off. But, despite myself, I was a little curious about the effectiveness of its products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxatone Intensive Overnight Repair Cream has won me over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is not going to work miracles but I&#x27;ve found the results remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to see a difference right away. Now, after a month--and less than half the jar used--I am really impressed by the improvement in my skin. I&#x27;m almost fifty. Since I started using this cream, I like what I see in the mirror more than I have for years. Here&#x27;s what it&#x27;s done for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -fixed my dry skin, making it look and feel soft and smooth;&lt;br /&gt;  -took away fine lines and significantly repaired deeper ones;&lt;br /&gt;  -fixed my pale complexion, giving it a healthier-looking glow (bonus: my dark circles aren&#x27;t nearly as prominent now);&lt;br /&gt;  -toned my skin, especially below my eyes;&lt;br /&gt;  -reduced the appearance of pores, especially across my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the texture. It&#x27;s creamy and not a bit heavy or oily. I also love that it has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel it on my face for the first minute or two after I put it on. It&#x27;s a little tingly, almost warm. At first, that worried me. I have very sensitive skin. I was concerned it might break me out. But that didn&#x27;t happen and each week has been better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label warns you to avoid getting it in the eye area and I imagine it would be most unpleasant in the eyes. Hydroxatone makes separate products for the eye area and I&#x27;ve been so impressed with this product, I&#x27;m going to order the eye serum [[ASIN:B000TVNIY0 Hydrolyze (.5 Oz) Age Deying Eye Serum - Reduces Wrinkles, Dark Circles &amp; Under Eye Puffiness]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to throw away money on beauty products. I&#x27;m going to keep using Hydraxatone Intensive Overnight Repair Cream because it really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never imagined I could see such results for only about $1 a day.such results for only about $1 a day.</li>
    <li> This I gave to my wife and I&#x27;ll relay her message here.  She says it \\&quot;works really good\\&quot;.  So there you have it, folks!</li>
