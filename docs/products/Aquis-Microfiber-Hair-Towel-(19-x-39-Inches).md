### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best microfiber towel out there!  </li>
      <li>On days where I don&#x27;t soak my head, this towel is perfect for moist scrunching, when I wouldn&#x27;t use my turban for that.  </li>
      <li>If they stopped making their turbans, I&#x27;d be happy to continue using these towels in their place.  </li>
      <li>Great towel for hair drying.</li>
      <li>My wife finds these very effective in reducing drying time which reduces the heat stress on her hair.</li>
      <li>I love this fabric -- awesome</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size (wraps up easily and doesn&#x27;t fall apart) and works well.</li>
      <li>Beautiful colour (very important) perfect size and quality, exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>Think I need to order a couple more!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>Not too sure I&#x27;ll order it again for fear of receiving another foul smelling towel.</li>
      <li>Love it&lt;br</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE my Aquis turban, but wanted to try the hair towel also.  </li>
      <li>I really love this, ordered two more.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
      <li>Fits around and wraps on top of my head without issue.</li>
      <li>I ordered two this time to rotate and let one dry a full two days between uses now, hoping for the best.</li>
      <li>you, but it does fine.</li>
      <li>light and absorbent.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why the descriptions can sound identical and the products are worlds apart.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for long hair too.  </li>
      <li>but this towel is good for someone with short to medium hair.</li>
      <li>Very happy with these towels (this is my third or fourth purchase)</li>
      <li>my hair quick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good helps my hair dry faster</li>
      <li>They dry my hair very quickly and I love the color.</li>
      <li>but I love the extra length.</li>
      <li>I really like this hair towel!</li>
      <li>I just bought several more for my family members.</li>
      <li>The size is large.  </li>
      <li>After this towel, wow, nice long relaxed curls every time!</li>
      <li>Drying time is so much shorter.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>my favorite towel for wrapping over my wet hair.</li>
      <li>I have owned microfiber hair towels before and they work very well.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair, and this towel helped reduce frizz while drying my hair faster.</li>
      <li>Love this product so much I bought a few extras for my gym bag and also one for my daughter.</li>
      <li>I put it on the bathroom rod to dry the towel, the towel dries quick also&lt;</li>
      <li>I bought my first one from bed bath and beyond about ten years ago and used every day!</li>
      <li>The first was terrific.</li>
      <li>This towel is very large and is meant for long hair.</li>
      <li>Still a thousand times better for drying long hair than any other towel I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair that frizzes a lot.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that when I ordered and was surprised</li>
      <li>It was exactly the same, except a different color.  </li>
      <li>My hair is long enough that this towel isn&#x27;t actually as long as I&#x27;d prefer, but it does the job and the quality is incomparable.  </li>
      <li>Twenty-some years ago, I had a super-absorbent towel like this, and I really don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get another.</li>
      <li>I have long curly hair and before this towel, it would frizz up and no matter how much product I used, frizz all day.</li>
      <li>but I do find they tend to get mildew-smelly after a year or two of daily use with frequent washings.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length hair at it just barely made a turban</li>
      <li>- dries quickly, easy to pack - might be too small for someone with long hair -</li>

    <li> Twenty-some years ago, I had a super-absorbent towel like this, and I really don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get another. Now that my hair is long again, it&#x27;s so helpful in cutting down the drying time. It&#x27;s the perfect size (wraps up easily and doesn&#x27;t fall apart) and works well. Think I need to order a couple more!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that is past my bra strap, but not thick.  I absolutely LOVE my Aquis turban, but wanted to try the hair towel also.  My hair is long enough that this towel isn&#x27;t actually as long as I&#x27;d prefer, but it does the job and the quality is incomparable.  I&#x27;m not dissatisfied at all, but prefer the ease of their turban over this.  If they stopped making their turbans, I&#x27;d be happy to continue using these towels in their place.  On days where I don&#x27;t soak my head, this towel is perfect for moist scrunching, when I wouldn&#x27;t use my turban for that.  I&#x27;ll probably buy another just for travel, even.  I&#x27;m an Aquis fan and other microfiber towels just do NOT compare (and I&#x27;m in the beauty industry and a microfiber snob when it comes to my spoiled hair).</li>
    <li> my favorite towel for wrapping over my wet hair. light and absorbent. Not miraculously absorbent mind you, but it does fine.</li>
    <li> I found a dirty mark on the towel when I open it at the first time！ it looks used one！</li>
    <li> I really love this, ordered two more. They dry my hair very quickly and I love the color.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colour (very important) perfect size and quality, exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that frizzes a lot. This towel has been a life saver. Drying time has been cut in half and much less frizz.</li>
    <li> This towel is very large and is meant for long hair. I didn&#x27;t realize that when I ordered and was surprised but I love the extra length.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my second towel! I bought my first one from bed bath and beyond about ten years ago and used every day! I have very curly hair, and this towel helped reduce frizz while drying my hair faster. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Best microfiber towel out there!  This towel absorbs faster than several brands I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  It washes well leaving the absorbency in the towel as well as the color.  No fading.  The size is large.  It&#x27;s great for long hair too.  It wraps fully around the head leaving enough room to tuck it under the nape of your neck.  I just bought several more for my family members.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery, thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! I was skeptical for a long time, but finally purchased a microfiber towel. I have long curly hair and before this towel, it would frizz up and no matter how much product I used, frizz all day. After this towel, wow, nice long relaxed curls every time! I read several reviews on Amazon and this towel from Aquis is a winner!</li>
    <li> Came dirty and smelled like gas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used  Aquis towels for towel drying my hair.....nothing beats this product.  My recent Amazon order of the blue Aquis towel was returned because the towel had a foul order which is why I gave it one star  Not too sure I&#x27;ll order it again for fear of receiving another foul smelling towel.</li>
    <li> I bought this online simply because I like the color.  I have owned microfiber hair towels before and they work very well.  I will say, I found another one for about a third of the price at TJ Maxx.  It was exactly the same, except a different color.  I would say order it if you can&#x27;t find it anywhere else cheaper.  It does cut the drying time for my hair down to nothing.</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;-dries my hair quick&lt;br /&gt;-after drying by hair I put it on the bathroom rod to dry the towel, the towel dries quick also&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con yup there is one&lt;br /&gt;- My hair is really long but this towel is good for someone with short to medium hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good helps my hair dry faster</li>
    <li> Garbage. This was my second purchase of supposedly the same hair towel. The first was terrific. This would barely qualify as a poor shop towel. Not absorbent. Not a good size. Not soft. I don&#x27;t know why the descriptions can sound identical and the products are worlds apart.</li>
    <li> Great towel for hair drying. Fits around and wraps on top of my head without issue. Hair dries faster when I use this towel.  Love this product so much I bought a few extras for my gym bag and also one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Love it! Drying time is so much shorter.</li>
    <li> not much more to say than that - dries quickly, easy to pack - might be too small for someone with long hair - I have shoulder length hair at it just barely made a turban</li>
    <li> My wife finds these very effective in reducing drying time which reduces the heat stress on her hair.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these towels (this is my third or fourth purchase) but I do find they tend to get mildew-smelly after a year or two of daily use with frequent washings. I ordered two this time to rotate and let one dry a full two days between uses now, hoping for the best. Still a thousand times better for drying long hair than any other towel I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I like it  I use it when I wrap up my hair and the towel is dry before the next use.</li>
    <li> I love this fabric -- awesome</li>
    <li> Gave it to daughter as a present.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair towel! It wicks the water out of my hair so well!</li>
