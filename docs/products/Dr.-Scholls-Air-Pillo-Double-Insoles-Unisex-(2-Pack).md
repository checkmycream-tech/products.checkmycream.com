      <li>wonderful, these feel good on my feet.</li>
      <li>these things are great.</li>
      <li>So these fit perfectly in my shoes without making them too snug!</li>
      <li>I am going to order more!</li>
      <li>Product is great, and I received them very quickly.</li>
      <li>Comfortable feet makes a happy person.</li>
      <li>Buy a pair of these for every shoe and slipper I own.  </li>
      <li>I love these insoles.  </li>
      <li>so they rate 5 stars from me like most Dr Scholl&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more.</li>
      <li>Ok purchase.</li>
      <li>enjoyed them</li>
      <li>The top layer started peeling away in three weeks and it looks ragged now..</li>
      <li>The fit is better but what made them work for me might be a detriment for you, esp in warmer/hotter weather when feet tend to swell.  </li>
      <li>Got to me pretty fast, the price is great for two packs, had to cut a pair shorter to fit in my shoe but no big deal, fits great in my boyfriends shoe got it for his job to help with foot pain, can feel the memory foam hope it lasts a while.</li>
      <li>so i tried these cheap ones.</li>
      <li>Works great if your shoes have enough room to accommodate them.</li>
      <li>I think that these are great for a cheap, simple and comfortable shoe insert.</li>
      <li>These insoles can be cut to size, make my shoes feel much more comfortable and the price is right.</li>
      <li>For me, these were exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>They and your feet are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;. . .</li>
      <li>but my feet have become more sensitive to being on my feet all day.</li>
      <li>but, they are well worth it.  </li>
      <li>Fit well, decent cushioning.</li>
      <li>They are simple, comfortable and easy to cut to your size.</li>
      <li>These cover the whole sole of your feel which is nice.</li>
      <li>Made my back feel so mucb better.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t require too much space in your shoes, making the shoes no longer fit properly.</li>
      <li>Really helps reduce stress on the soles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say that if your shoes already fit snugly then these will be too think for you, maybe try the regular air pillows.</li>
      <li>We all wore &amp;#34;double&amp;#34; Dr Scholl&#x27;s, 2 of the original regular thickness product, just to survive the day.  </li>
      <li>22 years of trade shows standing on concrete floors.  </li>
      <li>I had spinal fusion so normal insols hurt</li>
      <li>good idea for shoes that are a little bit loose...</li>
      <li>They fit 95% of all my other shoes.</li>
      <li>These are too thick for a couple of pairs of my tighter fitting shoes.  </li>
      <li>but I wish  the price was more reasonable as it is a bit expensive - but that&#x27;s capitalism isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re comfortable, and not too thick.</li>
      <li>The latest pair of shoes that I bought for work, are a size too big, because my regular size were just a little too tight in the toe area.</li>
      <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that they are white and the tops are a little slippery at first.</li>

<li> Extremely helpful product</li>
<li> Not as thick as I was expecting them to be, but still added comfort, but you can always use both pair in the same shoes!</li>
<li> too thick for shoes unless you have roomy shoes or 1/2 size larger.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything in my shoe, just a hard flat surface.</li>
<li> They should make them in dark colors for dark colored shoes!</li>
<li> Then one day, they made a double thick product!  </li>
<li> Cutting them down to size is simple.</li>
<li> Thick and made of memory foam.</li>
<li> This was actually worse than what I had in to begin with.</li>
<li> Painful.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these insoles.  In the process of replacing all of my shoes insoles with these!  Product is great, and I received them very quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought these after walking out of a pair of shoes while going up steps.  The fit is better but what made them work for me might be a detriment for you, esp in warmer/hotter weather when feet tend to swell.  &amp;#34;Extra cushioning&amp;#34; is noted on the seller&#x27;s page though, so they rate 5 stars from me like most Dr Scholl&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Just as promised.  Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Thick and made of memory foam. Really helps reduce stress on the soles.</li>
    <li> Fit well, decent cushioning.</li>
    <li> Extremely helpful product</li>
    <li> The top layer started peeling away in three weeks and it looks ragged now.. Need a refund</li>
    <li> these things are great. never have shoes on without them.</li>
    <li> wonderful, these feel good on my feet. Some others I tried only cover part of your feet and I don&#x27;t like the feel of&lt;br /&gt;the edge. These cover the whole sole of your feel which is nice.</li>
    <li> I had spinal fusion so normal insols hurt so i tried these cheap ones. Made my back feel so mucb better. Definitely recomend</li>
    <li> but I wish  the price was more reasonable as it is a bit expensive - but that&#x27;s capitalism isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> 22 years of trade shows standing on concrete floors.  We all wore &amp;#34;double&amp;#34; Dr Scholl&#x27;s, 2 of the original regular thickness product, just to survive the day.  Then one day, they made a double thick product!  Works great if your shoes have enough room to accommodate them.</li>

    <li> These insoles can be cut to size, make my shoes feel much more comfortable and the price is right. Definitely a repeat buy!</li>
    <li> I am going to order more!</li>
    <li> This was actually worse than what I had in to begin with. Doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything in my shoe, just a hard flat surface.</li>
    <li> Just go ahead and spring for the Dr Scholls.  They and your feet are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;. . . Posted by a woman with pins, screws and bunions in and on her feet . . . Painful.  Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> too thick for shoes unless you have roomy shoes or 1/2 size larger. Over time cushion will compress. Ok purchase.</li>
    <li> works as advertised. enjoyed them</li>
    <li> Buy a pair of these for every shoe and slipper I own.  They wear out after a month or so but, they are well worth it.  These are too thick for a couple of pairs of my tighter fitting shoes.  They fit 95% of all my other shoes.</li>
    <li> Not as thick as I was expecting them to be, but still added comfort, but you can always use both pair in the same shoes!</li>
    <li> I like these Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Double Air-pillow Insoles with Memory Foam. They&#x27;re comfortable, and not too thick. They don&#x27;t require too much space in your shoes, making the shoes no longer fit properly. Cutting them down to size is simple. The only downside is that within a month or two, they become really flat and worn out, requiring replacing. It&#x27;s not that big a deal since they cost less than $5 a piece. I like them.</li>
    <li> good idea for shoes that are a little bit loose...</li>
    <li> I could not even tell a difference from before I had them to after I had them</li>
    <li> For me, these were exactly what I wanted! I have used the regular air pillows in plenty of shoes but my feet have become more sensitive to being on my feet all day. These are thicker then the regular ones, but not overly so. They are simple, comfortable and easy to cut to your size. The latest pair of shoes that I bought for work, are a size too big, because my regular size were just a little too tight in the toe area. So these fit perfectly in my shoes without making them too snug! I&#x27;d say that if your shoes already fit snugly then these will be too think for you, maybe try the regular air pillows. I think that these are great for a cheap, simple and comfortable shoe insert. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that they are white and the tops are a little slippery at first. They should make them in dark colors for dark colored shoes!</li>
    <li> Love them where I work I am on my feet all day they have stood the test !!!! Comfortable feet makes a happy person. I will be buying more.</li>
