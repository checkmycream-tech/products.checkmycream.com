      <li>Love it bought several more.</li>
      <li>Again, Denman does their name proud with this little treat.</li>
      <li>the bristles are perfect for my wavy but somewhat thin hair.  </li>
      <li>Its a nice styling brush too with just enough curve to turn my ends under.  </li>
      <li>I find the solid, one-piece design to be comfortable and easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>It was wonderful for use wet or dry.</li>
      <li>The bristles don&#x27;t fall out like normal brushes and have a ball-shaped tip that is comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>I have found it to be excellent for detangling curly hair (Type 3c) and very long straight hair with minimal hair breakage.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and a rather sensitive head when it comes to brushes or combs.  </li>
      <li>It is perfectly sized for my hand, and gently and thoroughly detangle wet or dry locks.</li>
      <li>My favorite brush lasted several years and until I found an identical brush on Amazon to replace it, I had to come up with a possible new replacement make that would be better than what was available in stores and beauty shops nowadays.  </li>
      <li>And this hair brush is first class quality.  </li>
      <li>I have thick hair, so this brush is great for when I get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>I was greatful my husband found this nearly exact brush.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>Like it so much I bought two!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It turned this brush is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>This brush has positively transformed our morning routine and is one of my fav Amazon purchases to date.</li>
      <li>that I know would find this brush a positive addition to their hair care</li>
      <li>Somewhat small but feels good in my hand and</li>
      <li>My hair is free of tangles yet not brushed into a consistent mass.</li>
      <li>Definitely a new fan of, and will buy more of, this Denman brush in the future.  </li>
      <li>I had only used and worn out possibly six (6) brushes (at the most!)</li>
      <li>Wide spacious strong bristles on a one piece brush that looks like will last what more can you ask for in a brush.</li>
      <li>The handle might be too small for someone with a large hand.but for the average women it works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Very sturdy and holds up very well.</li>
      <li>I keep a separate Denman brush in my purse, that is how much I like this brush.  </li>
      <li>Also, the tips of each bristle are rounded, making this brush gentle on the scalp esp.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair when encountering a tangle, it just gently glides through it.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend the product!</li>
      <li>When I am ready to begin smoothing and styling, I switch to another brush.</li>
      <li>I expect this one to last 32 years or more and have retired my old brush one to my vacation \\&quot;Go</li>
      <li>all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own 2 other Denman brushes: Denman Classic Styling Brush Free Flow Wide Spaced Pins and Denman 7 row.</li>
      <li>They are high quality, easy to clean, and they last a LONG time.  </li>
      <li>I used to buy cheap Goody vent brushes at the drugstore and they lasted 3 months if I was lucky before the little plastic ball-tips started coming off, wreaking havoc with my hair, breaking it off.  </li>
      <li>All black design is sleek and it is very light</li>

    <li> Best blow dry brush ever.</li>
    <li> I used to buy cheap Goody vent brushes at the drugstore and they lasted 3 months if I was lucky before the little plastic ball-tips started coming off, wreaking havoc with my hair, breaking it off.  I decided to switch to a Denman vent brush, thinking there was no difference in brushes. This is slightly smaller than the Goody brush, though, so I recommend this size for short to medium hair. I&#x27;ve had the D200 for over a year and it still looks new. The bristles are very kind to your hair.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a nice soft brush like my old one (different make but looked similar to this), this said &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; in the title, but it really isn&#x27;t it&#x27;s quite harsh on one&#x27;s scalp and I&#x27;m not currently using it.</li>
    <li> From a hairdresser in the business for over 35 years this brush is 5 star! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Great brush- durable, effective, easy to clean. I bought a second on to keep in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Best brush on the market! Perfect for straightening your hair, great for purse and travel! Love it bought several more.</li>
    <li> I like the one I lost better.</li>
    <li> My barber recommended this to me...so I went and bought it. If you&#x27;re hair is pretty long (guys I mean) I&#x27;d say at least 2-3 inches than it does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this black Denman type brush for many years.  Its just a great brush in your hair and in your hand.  I keep a separate Denman brush in my purse, that is how much I like this brush.  It goes through your hair smoothly, long or short.  The men in my family use one too.  It has vents for the dryer to go through and the firm bristles are gentle on the scalp.  The round ball on the end is one piece with the bristle so they don&#x27;t break or come off with a lot of use like other brush bristles do.  Its a nice styling brush too with just enough curve to turn my ends under.  They last for years too.  I bought this one recently to replace one that someone walked off with!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Denman D200 brushes for years and was very glad to find them available on Amazon. These brushes are practically indestructible and last forever. If they need cleaning just pop them in the dishwasher and they&#x27;re good as new. Because of the vented design they are light weight even though they are molded as a single hunk of nylon. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out like normal brushes and have a ball-shaped tip that is comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected but I like it anyway and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have another that I bought a couple of years ago that I am still using. Very sturdy and holds up very well. Cuts blow drying time in half. I bought this one to keep in my car as backup on days where I am in a rush and forget to grab my brush lol.</li>
    <li> The quality of this brush can be that compared to the dollar store. But it works and functions as promised.</li>
    <li> Handy and makes drying my hair a breeze (pun intended). My hairdresser uses these which is why I bought one. Should have bought several of them.</li>
    <li> The only brush we use. One solid piece and they last a long time.</li>
    <li> A nice, sturdy but lightweight brush to help me smooth my hair as I begin to blow-dry.  With the vents, it helps remove excess moisture quickly and keeps my wavy hair from tangling up while doing so.  It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair when encountering a tangle, it just gently glides through it.  I find the solid, one-piece design to be comfortable and easy to hold.  When I am ready to begin smoothing and styling, I switch to another brush.</li>
    <li> Great quality--lightweight but sturdy.  Somewhat small but feels good in my hand and the bristles are perfect for my wavy but somewhat thin hair.  Comfortable on the scalp.  The handle might be too small for someone with a large hand.but for the average women it works perfectly.  Will be perfect for travel, too.</li>
    <li> I lost my brush like this and could not find the exact same one in any store. Stores carry one that looks the same but it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;move through my hair without pulling, the one in the stores currently is a harder plastic, I was happy to find this one</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brush. Over the years, I think I&#x27;ve purchased about 4 of them. One to keep at home, one in my travel stuff, one in my gym bag, and one to replace my home one that I lost. It works well and doesn&#x27;t fall apart (I hate it when other brushes lose the bristles if they get stuck in a knot!). It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair full of static in the winter. If I ever need an extra brush, I will be buying another of these!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and a rather sensitive head when it comes to brushes or combs.  I have bought and thrown out more brushes in the last few years than I care to try and count.  My favorite brush lasted several years and until I found an identical brush on Amazon to replace it, I had to come up with a possible new replacement make that would be better than what was available in stores and beauty shops nowadays.  I saw a lot of good reviews for Denman brushes and decided to give them a try.  This brush is amazing, does not produce any static in my fine hair, and fit what my hair and head needed.  Absolutely what I was looking for over the last 5 or 6 years.  Definitely a new fan of, and will buy more of, this Denman brush in the future.  I recommend this brush to anyone who has a hard time with the current brush selections in the store or beauty shops.</li>
    <li> Perfect little brush to take on trips.</li>
    <li> This brush is a hidden GEM! It is a solid piece of plastic therefore, there are no tiny pieces of plastic that will cause hair breakage. Also, the tips of each bristle are rounded, making this brush gentle on the scalp esp. for children. I have found it to be excellent for detangling curly hair (Type 3c) and very long straight hair with minimal hair breakage. It does a fantastic job of clumping curls! It was wonderful for use wet or dry. It cleans within seconds. Simply run under warm/hot water. There is enough space between bristles to make detangling easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction is solid. It will last a lifetime. All black design is sleek and it is very light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased as gifts for others that I know would find this brush a positive addition to their hair care routine.&lt;br /&gt;Denman did it again with this one! 5 stars all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own 2 other Denman brushes: Denman Classic Styling Brush Free Flow Wide Spaced Pins and Denman 7 row.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for natural hair, 4b if you&#x27;re into typing. It detangles more thoroughly than a comb (I recommended that you finger detangle or use a wide tooth comb to get out any major kinks before you use the brush). Obviously this brush is not modifiable. The bristles are not very flexible, but not too stiff either, so they&#x27;re kinda in between. I expect this brush to last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Have used this type for years and it works great.</li>
    <li> Best hairbrush ever.  I&#x27;m so glad they are still available!</li>
    <li> Best brushes EVER! Own 3 of them and my husband has one too, so we have 4 in our home!</li>
    <li> Great for detangling both inside the shower and out, nice on the scalp, lightweight for travel, and very durable. Like it so much I bought two!</li>
    <li> Best vent brush ever! Good for flat ironing as well.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these for several years, usually 4 at a time. Doesn&#x27;t get knotted in my hair, feels great on the scalp. I have medium to long hair that is medium thickness</li>
    <li> I usually love this brush and it should last a very long time. However, this brush. I have only used for about one month and it is already breaking. It is a faulty design and I would like to replace it with a non faulty one for no charge. I am extremely disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> There are many types of  brushes out there  but good  feeling when brushing not all I have bought some that use once or twice and I&#x27;m ready to throw them on the trash can ,,,,,  this brush is the best .....</li>
    <li> The best for fine fragile hair! I have tried them all and this is my life time go to brush.</li>
    <li> What I love is the knobbed tips of the brush are part of the molded bristle rather than the glued on tips which always break off over time.&lt;br /&gt;The previous Denman Vent Brush brush lasted 32 years and I was worried I could not find a replacement.  I was greatful my husband found this nearly exact brush. I expect this one to last 32 years or more and have retired my old brush one to my vacation \\&quot;Go Bag\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, natural hair and while this brush does help to detangle, it feels flimsy in the hand and just doesn&#x27;t do the same job as a regular Denman.  When you have hair as thick and tangled as mine, nothing compares to heavy-weighted brush.</li>
    <li> Always have trouble with brushes which are too large for blow drying short hair.  Couldn&#x27;t find this at the local beauty supply; really happy to find it online.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, only brush I use for the past 20 years....I recommend this one to everyone, try it.</li>
    <li> This thing looks like its going to last forever. I&#x27;m a guy and needed a brush with not too many bristles for a nice swooped back look, and this does the trick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a seamless hairbrush for my coily coif for months. Again, Denman does their name proud with this little treat. It seams this is carved from one big hunk of plastic so it doesn&#x27;t have the usual seams you get where the pins are attached to the base. Love it.</li>
    <li> Not as great as I thought---next time I will pay a bit more for the next step up in quality.&lt;br /&gt;Am using it as a cat brush, which seems to work well ????</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this vent brush for years - in fact, I purchased this one to replace one that I&#x27;ve used almost daily for over 20 years!  It&#x27;s no wonder it was recommended by my stylist, and price point makes it more that a great value.  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Nice and small  for my carrying around in my purse.  Great for detangling my my wet hair with no hair conditioner after a surf session at the beach.  I would have preffer if it only had three rows for easier detangling, but five rows seems to be the small brush norm.</li>
    <li> After reading all the glowing reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try it. I wish I&#x27;d known about this brush years ago! I plan to buy more for my 4 daughters &#x3D;-)</li>
    <li> Seems to be made well but it is nothing special and the price was not that bad.  I use it to groom my dog.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand and style of brush for 15 years.  They are high quality, easy to clean, and they last a LONG time.  I was happy to find it on Amazon - and I bought my kids one, too.</li>
    <li> Good size, solidly made with rounded tips.  I roll my hair and it brushes the curls out without taking out all the body.  Like that&#x27;s is smaller - I bought one for travel bag and one for home.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for brushing out wet hair or styling hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush. Yes there are others out there for less but I have never had a faster detangling session! All plastic design makes it great for shower use.</li>
    <li> I worked in the beauty industry for many years, and tried many tools of the trade, over the years. I have probably at one time or another, owned just about any professional brush I could get my hands on. This is by far, the very best vented brush I have ever owned, and I am so happy to have found them again......AFTER giving the last one I had to my mom. I plan to buy a couple more, so I am never without one again!</li>
    <li> Wide spacious strong bristles on a one piece brush that looks like will last what more can you ask for in a brush.</li>
    <li> Go first class all the way, it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run.  And this hair brush is first class quality.  One piece construction means no bristle will falls out like all those China brushes.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect vent brush. It glides through my long, course hair painlessly. At first, I thought it would be too small for the length of my hair, but it worked great &amp; my hair seemed to dry more quickly with great shine. This will be the only vent brush I will buy from now on!</li>
    <li> Like it. Would buy again</li>
    <li> So pleased to be able to find this product again.  I have lots of thick hair and this has always worked best for me.</li>
    <li> I use this brush daily on my daughter&#x27;s wavy hair. It is perfectly sized for my hand, and gently and thoroughly detangle wet or dry locks. This brush has positively transformed our morning routine and is one of my fav Amazon purchases to date.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!!  When I am styling with this brush it does not break my hair and gets a good grip on my hair.  All brushes are not equal.  This one is the best I have ever used.  Dont hesitate!  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever.  Allows you pick up hair in small pieces and large.  Love it.  We have used this brush for 30 year so.  Had one and after 25 years was getting used.  Could not find it locally.  I thought Amazon might have it.  I looked on the handle for the brand found and found it on amazon.  I have purchased 3 new ones just in case they stop production.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected, but works great.  Perfect for short hair.</li>
    <li> A lot easier to detangle without ripping my hair, but I do still get some breakage. I don&#x27;t use it to blow dry or anything. Just got it to try to avoid the bristles coming out.  The bristles ar spaced out pretty well, but I&#x27;m interested to see how well the white and red Denman would work.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair, so this brush is great for when I get out of the shower. And, it brushes thru tangles without straightening out curls.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brush with plenty of spacing between bristles, an &#x27;air brush&#x27;. I hadn&#x27;t tried a brush with stiff bristles before I purchased this brush, i didn&#x27;t realize how stiff the bristles would be. I thought the Hyflex name meant the brush was flexible.&lt;br /&gt;It turned this brush is exactly what I needed. My hair is free of tangles yet not brushed into a consistent mass. The wavy curls are defined.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before but have had a hard time finding it lately.  So happy to be able to buy it online....highly recommend the product!</li>
    <li> Been purchasing this product since I discovered it in the early 90&#x27;s. I had only used and worn out possibly six (6) brushes (at the most!) for the past 20 years!!! They maybe more $$$ than your typical hair brush, but this &amp;#34;made in England&amp;#34; brush is definitely worth every American penny!</li>
