<li> The seller shipped the items quicker than expected and was wrapped up in tissue paper - it was like getting a little present!</li>
<li> They work extremely well for blow outs</li>
<li> We use them every day, but some are already breaking. :/</li>
<li> This are the worst quality clips I have bought in my 22 yrs of career, they are super hard to open, and to complete the bad experience when I notified the seller of that issue, ( doctored locks, inc)</li>
<li> They give me the hold and grip that I was looking for and it took me hardly anytime to receive them.</li>

    <li> I have very fine hair and all those clips that say they work for fine hair never really work with my hair. These were perfect. I have even started using them instead of butterfly clips to put my hair up during the day and you can&#x27;t see any of the clip since my hair covers it. Comfortable and secure.</li>
    <li> These clips are awesome!!!</li>
