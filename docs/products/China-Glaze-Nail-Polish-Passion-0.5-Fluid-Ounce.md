      <li>Nice color.  </li>
      <li>very nice, highly pigmented, and great for you nail stampers out there</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT a manicurist, just a home user who is having fun with nail stuff after not painting her own nails for 25 years!  </li>
      <li>It is opaque enough to use for stamping and works great!  </li>
      <li>Such a great color!</li>
      <li>I received my nail polish today :-)</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this gorgeous color!!</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish and it came quicker than it was supposed to which is a plus.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it as a regular polish because I do gel polish, but it does work great for stamping!</li>
      <li>very rich</li>
      <li>The color is okay, but it chips easily and stains even with a top coat.</li>
      <li>Not too bold, just a nice gold shade.</li>
      <li>It was well packaged and the product is great so far.</li>
      <li>This brand goes on smooth and lasts.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and without lines</li>
      <li>BUT.. it is a great gold overall.</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful deep, golden color and is rich and highly glazed.  </li>
      <li>One coat is almost enough to be totally opaque, two is perfect.</li>
      <li>It looks great (has a great sheen) and last for quite a long time (longer than many of my other brands of polish).</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>If you aren&#x27;t looking for something super glamorous this nail polish is pretty.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Very gold!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Pretty not-too-yellow gold.</li>
      <li>It is more of a SOLID GOLD METAL type of Gold, NOT a MIRROR TYPE OF METALIC...</li>
      <li>pretty color.</li>
      <li>I got this polish for stamping, as I wanted a gold that really STOOD OUT, and this was it!  </li>
      <li>Covers well and looks pretty much like gold.  </li>
      <li>Acetone/alcohol can be very drying when doing gels.  </li>
      <li>One coat is all I really need.</li>
      <li>I have not used this for a whole nail.  </li>
      <li>The shimmer isn&#x27;t guady at all, and leaves a pretty classy look.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve included a photo of my latest creation I did for an Asian themed look for an Asian festival</li>
      <li>This product is highly pigmented.</li>
      <li>One coat is all you need and it gives you an amazing, thick gold color.</li>
      <li>I top off with a clear gel coat and cure after the China Glaze Gold has dried completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m not Asian, but my nails can be ;-)  )</li>
      <li>But remember, I stamped the design with this China Glaze polish, and then covered with a clear gel coat and cured.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very metallic, fluid.</li>

    <li> I love it!  It looks great (has a great sheen) and last for quite a long time (longer than many of my other brands of polish).</li>

    <li> This is a beautiful deep, golden color and is rich and highly glazed.  It goes on smoothly and without lines so it&#x27;s self leveling.  I was very pleased with the color, but can&#x27;t yet report on its lastability, but I&#x27;ll keep you posted.  I was very impressed with the seller because the first order got lost and the seller replaced it immediately and it arrived in a few short days.

    <li> Perfect for my Celestia cosplay~</li>
    <li> Covers well and looks pretty much like gold.  Would buy it again.</li>

    <li> Such a great color! One coat is almost enough to be totally opaque, two is perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this color!! Great shade of Gold, not too bold but just perfect!! I would definitely recommend this gorgeous color!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Very gold! Amazing! You will love it!</li>
    <li> I got this polish for stamping, as I wanted a gold that really STOOD OUT, and this was it!  This is my GO TO GOLD for any stamping or nail art applications. I have not used this for a whole nail.  It is opaque enough to use for stamping and works great!  It is more of a SOLID GOLD METAL type of Gold, NOT a MIRROR TYPE OF METALIC...so if you are looking for a mirror type of metalic gold, this is not it.  BUT.. it is a great gold overall. I&#x27;ve included a photo of my latest creation I did for an Asian themed look for an Asian festival I&#x27;m going to attend. (I&#x27;m not Asian, but my nails can be ;-)  )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT a manicurist, just a home user who is having fun with nail stuff after not painting her own nails for 25 years!  I use this color to stamp and do art over gel manicures I do at home. I top off with a clear gel coat and cure after the China Glaze Gold has dried completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo... hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.. don&#x27;t mind my dry cuticles/fingers, I was just about to apply cuticle oil to them after the manicure was done.  Acetone/alcohol can be very drying when doing gels.  But remember, I stamped the design with this China Glaze polish, and then covered with a clear gel coat and cured.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect shade of gold. It went well with my Egyptian themed nails. Packaging came on time and had no problems with delivery.</li>
    <li> Stamps well.  Pretty not-too-yellow gold.</li>
    <li> Its an awsome color and comes in on time... Reliable product</li>
    <li> I received my nail polish today :-) it is absolutely beautiful. One coat is all I really need. The color is just what is shown in the picture. Great for stamping as well. :-)</li>
    <li> pretty color. very rich</li>
    <li> This is not a very shimmery gold. I bought it for my bridesmaids and flower girls and think I will also purchase a bottle of clear/glitter to go with it. If I knew it was this dull I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. I&#x27;m usually thrilled with the outcome of China Glaze products but this was pretty disappointing. If you aren&#x27;t looking for something super glamorous this nail polish is pretty.</li>
    <li> I bought this polish because I LOVE the color! It&#x27;s very metallic, fluid. This product is highly pigmented. You only need ONE coat when painting your nails! The down side of this product is that since it&#x27;s metallic it&#x27;s hard to get a smooth coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> very nice, highly pigmented, and great for you nail stampers out there ;)</li>
