<li> When we&#x27;re walking our dog outside you can see her cute pink flushed cheeks from the little exposure from the sun (she tries to take all the shady paths).</li>
<li> But, so far, this is the third week of her taking those,  no significant improvement  </li>

<li> I chose this one because of the ingredients vs the other companies (do your research)</li>
<li> To my  disappointment, the capsules are too big for me as i have  a phobia in taking big pills as i was once attended by paramedics due to choking because i tried to take a big pill.</li>
<li> if she&#x27;ll find a foundation but even the shades in Ulta are too dark.</li>
<li> After 10 days my skib become very dark specially my face and looks unhealthy and looks there is something wrong is happining ..</li>
<li> I saw a little difference</li>
<li> She was already pale to begin with.</li>
<li> Am not sure it&#x27;s working...</li>
<li> Unbelievable.</li>
<li> (sorry for the TMI), and constantly have the rush to use the bathroom.  </li>
<li> ; but usually I am work.  </li>
<li> Nothing wrong with wanting a glow and tan tone to your skin-everyone is from a different origin-</li>
<li> Bottle - Past changes will become even lighter.</li>
<li> Bottle - Skins looks somewhat lighter than usual.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure about lightening</li>
<li> I mean she&#x27;s not that pale</li>
<li> Unbelievable!</li>
<li> Its so bad..</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m from Saudi arabia&lt;br /&gt;I want to buy this product. But I want to inquire about the manual mode in detail before buying</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t see any difference in my wife&#x27;s skin color.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT, GOT TO KEEP USING</li>

    <li> Fast shipping and it works for me,i love this product..</li>
    <li> It not working as how i thought it wouLd</li>
    <li> I saw a little difference so I&#x27;ve ordered a second bottle for great results!</li>

    <li> I havent got any results since I been taking ivory caps,I think its a waist of money</li>
    <li> I am on my 5th bottle and using it because of it&#x27;s ability to help cancer..</li>
    <li> Working great . Has not even been a month yet and I&#x27;m already seeing a difference in my skin . Highly recommend to all interested .</li>
    <li> Clothing is very beautiful and actually as required and an existing image</li>
    <li> Just started using this , only been two weeks and I&#x27;m already seeing results, so happy to see what the results going to be n another week or so....</li>
    <li> This my second time ordering this, so we&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
    <li> It did not work at all</li>
    <li> Does not work! already finished 3 bottles with no improvement.</li>
    <li> Good for my skin not much skin lightening, detoxes my body. But has to be used with vitamin c and the amount may make you sick. Do research and observe ur body.</li>
    <li> My bae uses my amazon prime account to order stuff for herself. She bought these pills to see &amp;#34;how white she can get&amp;#34;. She was already pale to begin with. (primarily Swedish background) She is currently on her third bottle. In the first picture she is not wearing any mascara and she is not wearing foundation in any of the photos. The first photo (with the &amp;#34;frowny&amp;#34; face) is before. The second picture (with the half smile) is of her after taking them for a month and the third picture (wearing the sweater) is of her now. The pills have worked to even out her complexion and her freckles have drastically almost disappeared (including the freckles on her arms). Keep in mind she is also staying out of the sun as much as possible and wearing sunscreen when she goes out to keep up her pale appearance during this experiment of hers. When we&#x27;re walking our dog outside you can see her cute pink flushed cheeks from the little exposure from the sun (she tries to take all the shady paths). Walking in the shade she appears to be &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34;. I mean she&#x27;s not that pale but idk what skin shade hers is now. We can&#x27;t even find makeup brands that aren&#x27;t darker than her current skin color. Sooooo liike idk if she&#x27;ll find a foundation but even the shades in Ulta are too dark. She does use Mineral Veil by Bare Minerals because that&#x27;s the closest thing. Yesterday she ordered some lotion and soap so we&#x27;ll see how that goes and maybe write a review about that too.&lt;br /&gt;Also please note that everyone&#x27;s bodies are different and this may or may not work for you. You won&#x27;t notice any major changes with just one bottle so if you want obvious results buy the value pack. (That&#x27;s what we did.)&lt;br /&gt;As for her health from taking these pills, nothing has changed for now. She sees the doctor quite regularly for checkups and her body is feeling fabulous inside and out.</li>
    <li> Arrived and just as pictured.  Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> OK so here&#x27;s the deal - DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE RESULTS WITH ONLY ONE BOTTLE!&lt;br /&gt;I am have just finished my 3rd bottle and can now see a VERY visible change.&lt;br /&gt;This is how it basically works with 2 pills a day in the morning:&lt;br /&gt;1st Bottle - Skins looks somewhat lighter than usual. More likely to look more like glowing skin. Mostly only you will see/tell there are changes.&lt;br /&gt;2nd Bottle - You will start to see you visible changes on hands, chest, thighs/legs.&lt;br /&gt;3rd Bottle - Past changes will become even lighter. Now visible changes on arms toes, fingers, neck and such. My Parents and Friends were able to see and notice the lighter changes in my skin tone. The rest of the skin is lighter too and skin blends evenly with darker areas.&lt;br /&gt;4th Bottle - I will try and tell you (I am guessing that most likely the face turns lighter and changes already visible turn even more lighter.)&lt;br /&gt;(Note To Self: I am Male and in my Teens and had very dark brown skin which is now only in-between skin-tone of dark and light brown; plus everyone&#x27;s body is different, however the more you use the pills the lighter you are mostly likely becoming even if it takes longer than I stated.)</li>
    <li> I been using this product for only a week at the moment.  However, when I take these pills (with or without food), it makes my stomach upset.  I start having gas (sorry for the TMI), and constantly have the rush to use the bathroom.  I really don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s necessary to &amp;#34;clean out your system,&amp;#34; but usually I am work.  So I cannot continue to take them like this.  Maybe other&#x27;s have had better results?</li>
    <li> Using it as a supplement for anti-oxidant property.  Can&#x27;t really tell if it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about lightening but they make your skin glow and clearer. For someone like me who deals with adult acne I was surprised that my face has never been clearer. On a side note if you drink liquor these polls will probably make you stop. I can barely drink one drink now. Apparently the main ingredient is actually used to treat alcoholism so I guess that makes sense. Hey , if you are on a diet then take these and you won&#x27;t have to worry about liquor calories haha</li>
    <li> I love this product! I would definitely say it has brightened my complexion with a nice glow. I take it in addition to Vitamin C and i am seeing great results after 2 bottles. I am a medium brown skin complexion and just like some go to tanning beds/sunbathing/etc to get darker/tan glow- I love having an option on how I can also have a nice brown skin complexion with a glow as well. I highly recommend this product, with consistency you will see results. My husband is Caucasian and loves the glow he sees in my skin. It has encouraged him to go tanning/etc to get a nice brown glow the route his nationality takes to get this color of skin. Nothing wrong with wanting a glow and tan tone to your skin-everyone is from a different origin-so how you achieve that complexion you desire will be different based on your origins. Additional note- You MUST use sunblock when going outdoors. I use sunblock before going outdoors and the results will remain consistent. I have an increase in confidence in the summer like never before since my skin gets dark very easily and I burn pretty easily. My husband is happy to see me so happy and feeling loved. I prayed and Jesus answered my prayer &amp;#60;3 Stay in Love and God Bless!</li>
    <li> Took this for 3 months. Does not work. No changes seen in skin color.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles, initially, to try it, one bottle for me and one bottle for my daughter. First thing i did as soon as i received it in tha mail, was to open one bottle to find out the size of the capsule or tablet. To my  disappointment, the capsules are too big for me as i have  a phobia in taking big pills as i was once attended by paramedics due to choking because i tried to take a big pill. Since then i have fears of swallowing big pills or tablets. My daughter has been taking the ivory caps whitening caps,  although she is by nature has very fair complexion, she only has some issues on some uneven color of her skin on one part of her upper arm. But, so far, this is the third week of her taking those,  no significant improvement  has been noted.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there will be a time soon, that the ivory whitening caps will be made in smaller pills so that i can have a chance to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Its so bad.. After reading the feedback i was super excited to get it cuz i have taning skin color and it becomes white if i take care of it. So i decided to buy it but it was a desaster !!!! After 10 days my skib become very dark specially my face and looks unhealthy and looks there is something wrong is happining .. Im going to the doctor to figure out whats the problem. I dont recomend it at all .</li>
    <li> They seem to work pretty. Good haven&#x27;t used them too long but they se to be working great</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see anything happens after taking this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good as expected</li>
    <li> if I can give 0 star or even minus, I would gladly give it. Doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable. So fast quick and low price.</li>
    <li> This stuff works,but you have to be constant.TOTALLY RECOMMEND :-)</li>
    <li> this does not work lie lie. I am a white Hispanic woman and buy this because I have dark spots on my face. and it did not make me the slightest change.</li>
    <li> Well I just started using it I will be taking 2 pulls in the morning and 2 at night and write a next review in two weeks</li>
    <li> Good! My skin is soft but I&#x27;m not more light ....</li>
    <li> I did not believe the hype of this product when I started taking it a year ago. I started taking it because of the glutathione, ( research it very interesting) I was not trying to lighten/ brighten my skin tone however, my skin is lighter in terms of having less hyper pigmentation ( dark spots left over from a pimple or scratch etc.) you have to be consistent with it and use sunscreen religiously. My driver&#x27;s license looks like a different me from what I now see in the mirror. I&#x27;m not a spokes person, salesperson, or employee in any capacity. I&#x27;m just interested in health (glutathione) and beauty and I Stephanie am a product junkie &amp;#34;Hi Stephanie&amp;#34; I love the product which is why I chose this rating, I would recommend it to anyone interested in science and modifying pigmentation, there are other products like Ivory Caps I chose this one because of the ingredients vs the other companies (do your research) Good Luck!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a drastic change but the pills do work. U must stay consistent. My body has always been lighter than my face. So I notice that my body was lighter first then face. Also I like the product because it gives u a glow.</li>
    <li> This pill is perfect. I would surely recommend it to everyone. Starting to see results in a matter of days!!!  Unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Am not sure it&#x27;s working... I only take it twice in a day... am still going to finish taking it and see if it improves</li>
    <li> Good product..gonna recommend this to my friends..:)</li>
