      <li>This is my first time buying incense, as well as the best offer I could find on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This incense burns beautifully and every scent is very distinct...</li>
      <li>which is actually kind of a plus, when you think about it.&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
      <li>: This one has a nice musk smell.</li>
      <li>For example, the Hem sticks I use had a 500 sq ft area smelling quite nice (1 stick alone)</li>
      <li>kind of smells like a rose.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice variety of incense.</li>
      <li>This is a good and yet interesting product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Lavender is kind of woodsy - don&#x27;t expect</li>
      <li>Kind of reminds me of the smell of autumn air, too.&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood</li>
      <li>It smells just like warm</li>
      <li>and I really liked it, so</li>
      <li>These are good for most home uses though.</li>
      <li>I also like Cedarwood, Patchouli, Pine, Musk and Rose.</li>
      <li>They just smell nice and don&#x27;t smoke you out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sandalwood is really nice.</li>
      <li>Without this variety package I would have never bought the floral scents and I found out that I liked some.</li>
      <li>Well, this is what you&#x27;ve always wanted and never gotten until now: a huge variety of fresh, fragrant, clean-burning incense at a wonderful price.  </li>
      <li>What I search for in my incense is a bargain price, while still serving good smelling and strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>I felt super nauseous and light-heated after doing that, lol.</li>
      <li>A great variety pack at a super price.</li>
      <li>However... the scent isn&#x27;t very strong and it can smell a bit smoky.</li>
      <li>Would be an awesome gift for your self,or far out friends!</li>
      <li>For anyone looking for a wonderful incense for making a room more pleasant, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>

      <li>Wow, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
      <li>Very fine incense.</li>
      <li>Very pleasant and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli smells like early morning rain or something.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cedarwood: I love the smell of cedarwood because it reminds me of my childhood.</li>
      <li>The quality of this insence is much better than what I thought.</li>
      <li>They are often out of my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>I love morning star incense.</li>
      <li>I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I think I even got it delivered a couple of days before the estimated delivery date. :)</li>
      <li>Love love love.  </li>
      <li>Now I have ample sticks stored in the fragrances I love.</li>
      <li>Once I started burning the incense though, I fell in love.  </li>
      <li>Have always enjoyed using these.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Morning Star Incense is good. But a smaller then years past. The variety is good. The price is fair for incense.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying incense, as well as the best offer I could find on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve tested 11 of the 12 fragrances, and the only one I don&#x27;t like is the cedarwood. This package will likely last about 2 years since I don&#x27;t burn one every day. I really enjoy coming into the room after recently burning incense, and the scent lingers for hours just by leaving the ash around.</li>
    <li> Having tried the lavender incense previously, I thought I&#x27;d see what else Nippon Kodo has to offer and this is a great way to see what scents you like best.  Having burned through at least 10 of each scent now, I can say that all are pleasant, some especially so.  A great way to figure out what you like best.  I will definitely be making more Nippon Kodo purchases in the future, I am quite satisfied with them.  I wish they were a little longer but they still have a good 20+ minute burn time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using incense for several years now. I&#x27;ve used everything from cheap Walmart brand incense, India incense, to high end Japanese incense. What I search for in my incense is a bargain price, while still serving good smelling and strong fragrance. Also my favorite kinds of scents are normally woodsy, spicy, and/or sweet. I&#x27;m not very picky when it comes to incense. I use incense daily so I look for incense that smells good while not breaking the bank. I&#x27;ll review each individual scent that comes in this offer of Morning Star incense from Nippon Kodo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose: I&#x27;m not a big fan of floral scents, mainly because smelling flowery scents reminds me of my former days burning really cheap chemically-smelling flower incense from Walmart. But Morning Star Rose is different than any kind of rose incense I&#x27;ve ever smelled. It&#x27;s really hard to describe, but to me it smells nothing like a rose. (Maybe just because I&#x27;m used to smelling artificial roses?) I can only describe it as a \\&quot;green rose\\&quot; scent. It smells more like the leaves of a rose more than the actual rose. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood: Sandalwood incense is a staple in many people&#x27;s collections of incense. I love the smell of sandalwood, but I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with Morning Star sandalwood incense. It&#x27;s not that it smells bad, but it&#x27;s not very strong, and while that may be the nature of Japanese incense, I was expecting more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamon: I&#x27;m a huge fan of cinnamon, and I wanted to really like this scent, but I couldn&#x27;t. It smelt nothing like pure cinnamon, just burning wood in a fireplace to me. Although I&#x27;ve found with Morning Star brand, that the more times I burn it, the more the scent grows on me, whether or not the scent actually matches the description name on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber: I&#x27;m not very familiar with this scent. I think I might have tried amber in other brand names of incense, and if I have, they didn&#x27;t leave an impression on me. Morning Star Amber does the opposite. I open the box of amber and it smells amazing, and burning it has the same results. It&#x27;s like a sweet woodsy aroma. I&#x27;ll buy this scent again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli: This one is nice smelling, just like what you would expect from patchouli, but the scent is not strong enough for my taste (again, because of the nature of Japanese incense being more subtle in fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanilla: This scent is sweet, almost too sweet. I couldn&#x27;t care for this scent either way, but those who are vanilla fans may really like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pine: I love the smell of pine. It reminds me of Christmas. But this Morning Star Pine smells much different than the kind of pine you would smell at Christmas time. It&#x27;s more sweet and subtle, which isn&#x27;t too bad. It just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea: I am a huge fan of green tea, whether it be hot green tea, iced green tea, green tea gum, green tea pocky, green tea hard candy, green tea ice cream, green tea cookies, green tea mochi, etc., so I was excited to try a green tea incense for the first time. And I was blown away. I open the box and I&#x27;m hit with a strong, sweet green tea smell. It definitely smells like a nice hot cup of green tea, and I think the scent even lingers longer than any of the other scents in the Morning Star line up. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy this one again and always have it in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cedarwood: I love the smell of cedarwood because it reminds me of my childhood. I loved hamsters as a child and whenever I smell cedar I think of my beloved pet hamsters. Morning Star cedarwood definitely delivers. It smells just like warm cedarwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jasmine: I&#x27;m not a fan of Jasmine, and Morning Star Jasmine didn&#x27;t make me change my mind. I think Morning Star Jasmine was the most artificial-smelling incense out of this line. Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender: This one also smells pretty artificial. I don&#x27;t particularly care for thisone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Musk: This one has a nice musk smell. But I&#x27;m not a fan of musk by itself. Sometimes I like to burn musk along with another scent, or buy incense that has a combination of one scent and musk (Amber Musk for example). Musk is such a subtle, quiet scent that it can practically go with any other scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Some people are complaining about the smoky smell, but what do you expect from incense that is only 28 dollars for 600 sticks? The smoky smell is less noticeable in some fragrances more than others, so don&#x27;t dismiss this product entirely because of it. I&#x27;m actually a big fan of India and Gonesh incense, which tends to be very smoky, so the slightly smoky smell in these Morning Star incense doesn&#x27;t turn me off one bit. Those who prefer smokeless brand Japanese incense might not like the smoky factor to this cheap Japanese incense. I love that each box comes with a tiny ceramic tile to hold the incense, but keep in mind you&#x27;ll need to place the tile on a plate or larger incense holder to catch the ashes. This is a real bargain, and while I won&#x27;t buy all of these scents again, I&#x27;ll buy scents like Green Tea, Cedarwood, and Amber in their 200 stick boxes for daily use. This complete 12 scent Morning Star set is great for an incense novice who is unsure what scents they would prefer, and would like to sample a wide variety of scents and choose their favorite scents without spending a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and this pack of incense is great for my frequent clients.  The variety is large enough for all to find at least one that they really like.</li>
    <li> This is the first set of incense I have ever bought or used.  The packaging was nice and all the smells are delicious!!  I burned the pine thus far and it smelt delicious all through the house.  The smell wasn&#x27;t over bearing and it wasn&#x27;t smokey.  I&#x27;m very excited to continue to use more.</li>
    <li> This is a good and yet interesting product.  First, it is a real surprise as it is like a large stick of mechanical pencil lead.  Second, it doesn&#x27;t have the traditional \\&quot;stick\\&quot; at the end.  Third, it comes with a little tile with a hole in the center to hold the stick on top of a plate or tray or flat rock or something decorative.  However, these little sticks burn well, smell great, and are not overpoweringly perfumy or smoky or dusky like most incense.  Very pleasant.  I have a VERY large greatroom and this scents it nicely without leaving overpowering smoke and scent in the upstairs bedroom.  AND, you get 600 sticks for the price!  That will keep you going for a long, long time.  It&#x27;s an overall good value and I just ordered a second set because I had an Amazon coupon.  I&#x27;ll be burning this for all of 2008 for sure!</li>
    <li> Hello everone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will love the sent from this package from Morning Star.  Great item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas</li>
    <li> I enjoy the use of Morning Star incense in my home and massage practice.    The quality of this incense feels clean and pure, with no additives.   Some may not be used to this quality after smelling and using other comercial incense with heavy perfumy fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smooth smell. Very subtle compared to the ones you get in the supermarket.</li>
    <li> Morning star is the best incense on the market. I&#x27;ve tried just about every incense I&#x27;ve run into and nothing else burns like this stuff. The Morning Star incense is real incense. There is no wooden center, just pure incense. Thus there is no smokey smell, and I&#x27;m not coughing when I burn it. All the scents are wonderful. And each stick burns for a long time. at least 20 minutes. Each box has 12 scents, with 50 sticks per scent. So it&#x27;s a ton of incense! At a much better price in the store, $3.50 - $4 for 50 sticks!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve lived, you&#x27;ve bought bad incense.  You&#x27;ve been disappointed by weak aromas, preposterously expensive cones, lack of variety in so-called assortments, stupid fragrances that just annoy you, ones that don&#x27;t even burn properly.      Well, this is what you&#x27;ve always wanted and never gotten until now: a huge variety of fresh, fragrant, clean-burning incense at a wonderful price.  Most of the old favorites are here (like jasmine, patchouli, and sandalwood), plus some inventive surprises (like cedar and pine).  We&#x27;re talking 50 sticks per box, 12 boxes in all -- *months* of scented delights.  Even includes a cute porcelain burner stand in each box.</li>
    <li> Ordered while i was in Iraq. Burned several at a time in my room. Really enjoyed this product. Seller had excelent service.</li>
    <li> love the incense was a bit pricey though</li>
    <li> I ordered a box of 12 assorted morning star incense I recieved 1 box of all amber scent 1 scent is not assorted.Amber was posted all over the box,however the bar code lable stated 12 assorted I would appreciate any compensation from bigfly sports.I was planning on doing alot of orders for morning star incence however until they compensate me I will not</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and a great gift idea!  Do yourself a favor and buy it.  I put the incense in sand in a little ceramic pot in the restroom.  Perfect!!    I snap the sticks in half to only burn a bit of it.  Excellent scents in sample pack!  Wow, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> I just received my \\&quot;Morning Star Incense - 12 Fragrance Assortment\\&quot;  however when I opened the package they had sent me a all \\&quot;pine\\&quot; scented incense.  It does smell lovely, and packaged in a nice neat box, and I am even tempted to keep it.   But the product I have received is clearly not a \\&quot;12 fragrance assortment\\&quot; as the product description and image described.      I am hoping I can change this to a 5 star review when I exchange the product for the assortment. [[ASIN:B000VGAWNI Morning Star Incense - 12 Fragrance Assortment]]</li>
    <li> Got the package in the mail.  Well packed.  Opened it and was surprised the boxes of incense were so small, and in turn the sticks were small.  Each package comes with a small incense burner which is nice.  Once I started burning the incense though, I fell in love.  Morning Star is light on the smoke in comparison to other incense I&#x27;ve tried, but big on scent and aroma.  It was actually a little overpowering for my husband but did not bother me at all.  I have tried several of the assorted scents and am pleased.  Even though the sticks are small, with 50 sticks per box and the quality of the aroma, all in all Morning Star incense is a great product.</li>
    <li> I order two box of 12 Fragrance Variety and receive 1 box of variety and 1 box of Valina sticker with 12 Fragrance Variety!!!</li>
    <li> What a rare find this is. I had given up on incense for years because of the  cheap products on the market these days with over-powering odor and (agreeing with previous commentator) the smokey residue emitted.  On a whim I tried this product.  Well this is the real deal in every way.  The incense is top quality and burns for a good half hour with the most pleasant scent imaginable.  This is my second purchase.  I ordered the smaller quantity of earlier and came back for the larger pack.    Adding to the quality of the purchase is this sellers absolute commitment to  excellence in customer service.  The delivery is lightening fast, all inquiries are answered immediately and as an added bonus they send extra incense sticks of scents you might be interested in.    oh! and by the way..this package deal makes excellent stocking stuffers for the holiday season.</li>
    <li> All of the scents are fantastic; rose being my favorite out of the samples. If you are just experimenting with Morning Star (or even incense in general) this would be a great place to start. Each package comes with a tile to hold the incense while it burns. This particular brand is not very smokey at all (a problem with other incense brands) and the smells are unique but not overpowering even in a small room. I love them!</li>
    <li> After buying this, I can say I&#x27;m not a fan of japanese style incense sticks. The lack of a wooden core is interesting but I guess I actually enjoy that burning woodsy smell. The things also produce less scent for shorter time and more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I love the variety of smells when I can actually smell them.</li>
    <li> Very fine incense. The sticks are shorter than I was led to believe however for the price its still a good buy.</li>
    <li> I have been buying incense now for a few years and have tried many different brands, but these are on another level. If you are looking for beautiful aromatic smells then these are for you.</li>
    <li> These incense are the absolute worst I&#x27;ve ever bought. I would recommend that if you want to burn them to burn them in your bathroom or other rooms no bigger than a bathroom. The scents are not strong at all. VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> Great smelling incense at a great price. Nice packaging and a rich choices of scents. You won&#x27;t be disappointed at all!</li>
    <li> What a blessing to be able to order Morning Star incense online! I have been buying it from a local Japanese owned, and run, store.locally. They are often out of my favorite scent. Now I have ample sticks stored in the fragrances I love. I also have a tiny ceramic incense burner from Morning Star. It is perfect for burning one stick at a time.</li>
    <li> Until I tried these incense sticks, I was only familiar with the sort that were long, thin sticks dipped into an aromatic substance, the kind that looked like the sparklers we used to play with as kids.    As others have stated, these incense sticks look more like a very long, thick piece of mechanical pencil lead, and they burn much cleaner and purer than the old dipped kind.    I purchased this sampler in order to try each of the scents, and have been pleased with each of them.  Each small box comes with its own little porcelain block that holds the stick upright (you&#x27;ll still want to place it over a small plate or bowl for easy cleanup of the ashes), and not a single stick in all the boxes was broken.    Morning Star incense isn&#x27;t as overpowering as some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past; it&#x27;s a much more subtle scent.  This is not to say, however, that it is weak or doesn&#x27;t fill a room; this certainly does, but it&#x27;s a much more natural smell.    With other incenses I&#x27;ve tried, walking into the room from elsewhere would make one think, \\&quot;Oh.. someone&#x27;s been burning incense.\\&quot;  But with these sticks, the reaction would more likely be, \\&quot;Oh, it smells like cedar! (or sandalwood, etc)\\&quot;    For anyone looking for a wonderful incense for making a room more pleasant, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love morning star incense. I was surprised that the lacks were small, but honestly there hasn&#x27;t been a scent I have disliked in these. They can smell a little soapy almost, but every scent is very pleasant. I have a very sensitive nose, and cannot stand strong smells from incense, as it can give me a headache. All the scents on these are pleasant and fairly long lasting, great for my altars. Burning time is pretty decent too.  My favourites are amber and musk as well as Jasmine.</li>
    <li> I really hoped that the fragrance was more intense and lasting. I was disappointed. I tested 12 fragrances and all smell alike. They even have a smell like salt. Another aspect is very little lasting 10 to 15 minutes. But I assume that is traditional in Japan this type of incense. Other brands will continue to test to see if I get one I like. One positive is the good presentation you have with your ceramic incense holder. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.  Plenty of incense, and a great variety to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run out of these, I&#x27;ll almost certainly buy some more.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the others gave it such rave reviews but I have to say there IS a rather smokiness to it. There actually was no good smell to the incense when they burn at all. They smell really good coming out of the package but when they burn they all smell like smoke and nothing else. I was very disappointed with this product.  Now I have so many of these things and will probably just have to throw them away. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I saw someone say it was really smokey,  just to be sure [as I didn&#x27;t think so] light the stick with a amtch and then blow out the flame so it smolders [kind of like a cigarrette]    I like the product a lot more then other incenses, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you will... if you don&#x27;t like stick incense, you may not like this, but if you do, this will seem wonderfull</li>
    <li> Nice smelling little sticks of fire... have little stone holders in each box. I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so small thou.</li>
    <li> Great incense and I love the individual boxes with the incense holders that you can travel with. Great item and transaction!! Highly recommend!! A++++</li>
    <li> Liked the wide variety. Now I know my favorite sent and can purchase just what I like. Have used this product before as I like the quality.</li>
    <li> first of all, this really is the best incense i&#x27;ve experienced.&lt;br /&gt;second of all, every little box comes with a cute little holder thats perfect for it&lt;br /&gt;but third of all, you really need to know these are short and burn up kinda fast and the smell is amaaazing while it lasts but it wont linger forever. which is actually kind of a plus, when you think about it.&lt;br /&gt;we like to burn them in the shower :)</li>
    <li> this kind of Japanese incense does smell more like wood burning with some scent on top. If you&#x27;re used to Indian incense, it may come as a surprise. I have used Morning Star for over 40 years. Wouldn&#x27;t burn any other. this variety pack has introduced me to many more scents (I had only used 4 or so in the past). I rotate through the different scents every morning. Very nice</li>
    <li> I thought they would be the 12&amp;#34;, but these ones are maybe 6. I like them just not the size.</li>
    <li> Stink up your bathroom? Look no more, you have found the perfect product to clean out the stinky smell. Do get a tray to catch the remains and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> Bought this variety pack because I enjoy Morning Star&#x27;s &#x27;Yuzu&#x27; fragrance and I remember smelling and liking a few of these.&lt;br /&gt;I like this series because you get a lot of incense for your money, they&#x27;re super-portable and can be tossed in a bookbag, they burn for a long time, and it&#x27;s the right amount of fragrance for a bedroom. It might sound dumb, but the boxes look very artistic too. I dig that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, only a few of these compare to the fresh scent of Yuzu, in my opinion. (Maybe I&#x27;m just a Yuzu fanatic ?)&lt;br /&gt;But Yuzu is crazy good, so maybe that isn&#x27;t fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we go:&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood is really nice. I dig it. I also like Cedarwood, Patchouli, Pine, Musk and Rose. Heck, I like Lavender, Jasmine and Vanilla too. Each scent is worth your while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cedarwood reminds me of sheds, old theaters and history museums.&lt;br /&gt;Pine is like a new car. Kind of reminds me of the smell of autumn air, too.&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood smells like a classy restroom, barbershop talc or leaves in the summertime.&lt;br /&gt;Lavender is kind of woodsy - don&#x27;t expect Febreze.&lt;br /&gt;Jasmine is a little bit harsh, smells like a clean bathroom. Oddly relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Musk is also has a new car smell. It&#x27;s more masculine than the other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Amber smells like fresh fruit and baby powder combined. It sounds weird but it&#x27;s actually great, nice and light.&lt;br /&gt;Green tea smells like someone shoved a bunch of herbs in your face. It has its uses I s&#x27;pose.&lt;br /&gt;Vanilla smells like a toasted marshmallow. But like a fancy, gourmet marshmallow. Very pleasant and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli smells like early morning rain or something. A little indescribable. Definitely good, though.&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamon is like cinnamon. And it&#x27;s fairly strong. Good for a kitchen or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;Rose kind of smells like a rose. Very floral. A little bit harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of these are familiar smells, but I can&#x27;t articulate them too well. Smell these for yourself and then you&#x27;ll knowwhether you like &#x27;em. And get some Yuzu! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: don&#x27;t get super excited over these and smell them all day. I felt super nauseous and light-heated after doing that, lol. Take yr time.</li>
    <li> As a big fan of Morning Star Incense, I was overjoyed to find this assortment. I am no expert on incense but I know what I like. According to the package, these are \\&quot;Traditional Japanese Style\\&quot; incense. Here is my description: Each box contains 50 sticks, each about 5\\&quot; long with an approximate burn time of 25 minutes. The entire stick is burnable, there is no naked stick at the end so they do not work well with the common incense holders that I have seen. Thankfully, each box also contains a small, square, ceramic holder that is appropriate for this style of stick. The fragrance assortment is fantastic. Whereas I prefer some of them to others, all scents deliver a pleasant aroma that one might expect from a stick of incense. I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice and at a good price</li>
    <li> A great variety pack at a super price. Good-quality incense, burns for a long time without too much ash. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this brand of incense. I have asthma and normally can&#x27;t tolerate incense at all. This incense is the only brand that I can use that won&#x27;t give me an asthma attack.  My acupuncturist recommended this incense to me and burned it every time i went for a treatment.  It&#x27;s definitely a mood booster for me and I use it everyday. I also use it outside on the deck to keep mosquitos away. seems to work pretty well.</li>
    <li> Pretty good value with free shipping to boot! Each box contains a ceramic holder and 50 sticks. The holes in the holders are a bit big for the size of these round sticks allowing them to lean a bit. Each stick lasts about 30 minutes and they provide a very nice scent. A little pricy but still a very good value.</li>
    <li> Too many scents that I am not fond of.....I&#x27;d prefer Green Tea, Cinnamon, Pine, etc.</li>
    <li> I love my sampler set. They all smell wonderful and burn for a good amount of time. They were the short sticks of incense which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
    <li> I normally stick to oil or cones because I don&#x27;t much like most incense but these don&#x27;t have the wood in the middle which creates a nasty smell as far as I&#x27;m concerned for most incense I&#x27;ve tried.  They are very small and you would not think that they burn as long as they do.  Each stick burns about 30 minutes and the fragrance is clean and fresh, not suffocating like some.  We started out with one pack that we found at a local store and after that was gone I was hooked and had to buy not only this variety pack but the pack of 6 that has the new scents.  Love love love.  I am sticking with this brand for sure.</li>
    <li> This box lasted me almost a year. It comes with a wonderful selection and a box to hold each scent. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, lite and easy to use, minimum mess. Costs less than the in-store price, even with shipping.</li>
    <li> Have always enjoyed using these.</li>
    <li> Each 5&amp;#34; stick burns about 30 mins.  The incense is fragrant, but not smoky.  The sticks are pencil-lead thin (about 2 or 3 mm), but are pretty sturdy and burn easily.  You can&#x27;t beat 50 sticks/per package&#x3D; 600 sticks at this price. Each box of incense comes with a ceramic burner. With the sampler package, you can also determine which fragrances you prefer.  I will most definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice variety of incense. They all smell very similar but don&#x27;t have that sickeningly sweet artificial odor that most incense has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favorites: Cedarwood, Pine, Musk, Amber, Sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh: Vanilla and Jasmine.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the sandalwood scented incense that Kohl&#x27;s used to sell and bought years&#x27; worth of tins of them. After six years, I ran out. I tried to find rich-scented sandalwood incense for years to replace these, but would always be disappointed...until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot about Nippon Kodo incense the last couple years, but given the smaller size and the different style of incense, I was reluctant to give them a try. Finally, I gave this assortment a shot and I&#x27;m in love. The sticks are smaller, but the scent is strong as they lack additives that force the sticks to burn longer, so the stick is pure essence. Not only does the sandalwood incense improve my mood, but I&#x27;ve found several other scents that I absolutely cannot get enough of: amber, patchouli, green tea, cedarwood, vanilla. Cinnamon, however, no...cinnamon took a long time to overcome the smell of the match, then it smelled like wood shop when a kid burned the wood with the drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of time, I&#x27;d say these little guys pack quite a punch. I am disadvantaged by having an old house, which means tall ceilings and large doorways between all the rooms on the main level. After I burn 2-3, the smell is everywhere and stays for a while, but given that it has to cover 1000 sq ft, it tends to fade a little quicker than I hoped. However, I burn these in my office (shhh!) and the smell stays 8-10 hours while lingering beyond the walls, too. So in normal spaces, one of these will get you through an afternoon easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting a wide-based holder for these as the holders that come with the incense, while successful at keeping the stick upright, fails to collect any ash. I&#x27;ve made it through with a coaster and a CD, but I&#x27;ll be looking for something a little nicer to replace these. That being said, if you buy this assortment, not only do you get 11 great scents, you&#x27;ll also get 12 holders as each pack contains one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I recommend this productto anyone who enjoys the heavier, muskier incense. And be prepared to be surprised at how great most of the scents are, and how strong and long the scent lasts! I&#x27;ll never leave Nippon Kodo again!</li>
    <li> Great product. At first I thought that they didn&#x27;t send any holders with the incense, then I realized that I opened it form the bottom and then realized that they all come with holders. What a pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> The concept of incense without a wooden stick center led me to believe that these incense would not have that &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; smell of  common wood stick incense. To my surprise these have that same burning odor and every scent regardless of its name smells the same. I have reverted back to my regular incense because they actually have a fragrance. Perhaps my olfactory senses are lacking but to my nose these all smell the same.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the variety. Good quality. I recommend this if you like to experiment. I don&#x27;t love all of the scents, but it&#x27;s fun to try. I do worry about the chemicals in these.</li>
    <li> Used to love this brand, wanted a large variety of scents without having to order them separately. When I got the package everything smelled overwhelmingly like cedar wood and patchouli. They mostly smell like an old folk&#x27;s home in the box, but all give off a nice, aroma. Also it should be said that they all pretty much smell the same when lit.</li>
    <li> I love this incense - it&#x27;s delicate, not cloying, burns beautifully and predictably, and the assortment of scents is great.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t your typical incense, they are very subtle. I personally like to light 3-4 at a time to get a nice mix and stronger scent.</li>
    <li> I expected some fragrance.  All the sticks smelled like was of something burning.  Smokey unpleaseant odor.  I had to open the windows.  I&#x27;m going back to wax tarts. Definitly not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love certain scents out of this pack; particularly the woody scents as well as cinnamon and green tea.  Unfortunately, not all scents were created equal.  The Jasmine smells like straight urine for some reason. Some scents were created equal and smell exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this is a variety pack, and the purpose is to find which scents you like.  So, I&#x27;m probably going to purchase more of the cinnamon, vanilla, and green tea. I believe that there is better sandalwood out there, and you can dang sure that I&#x27;ll find it.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this brand of incense to check it out and I really liked it, so I got this assortment to try out the other scents. This pack doesn&#x27;t include all of the available scents from this brand of incense, but a nice assortment. They burn well and last quite a while, with a nice lingering scent. I have yet to find a scent that I don&#x27;t enjoy, and have found a few more that I absolutely love. I seriously recommend this brand of incense.</li>
    <li> Not as hardcore as the Indian varietals, and less burning time but pleased nonetheless. Including the small holders is also a bright idea!</li>
    <li> Generally, this product is a good buy, especially in terms of the amount of incence sticks being attained. My reason for 4 stars though is that I find some of the fragrances actually very artifical smelling, which is a negative for me.</li>
    <li> This incense burns beautifully and every scent is very distinct...you can clearly smell the vanilla, lavender, cinnamon, etc.  The variety is fabulous.  I love the compactness of the incense and even though the sticks are small they pack a fragrant punch.  If you wanted to give these as little gifts (one pack per person) you can do that because each pack comes with its own burner.  Also convenient for burning multiple sticks at a time around the house.  I will definitely be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for a little over six months now, and I have to say I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it. The incense sticks are small, but they still burn for about 25-30 minutes. I only gave this set 4 stars because I don&#x27;t care for all of the scents, but the scents that I do like would definitely get 5 stars on their own. My favorite scents in this set are Cedarwood, Vanilla, Cinnamon, and Patchouli. I really hate the green tea scent and the pine. The rest I could take or leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this incense set as a tester to see which scents you like, since you can buy each of these scents on their own.</li>
    <li> A fabulous way to try them all and see which scent(s) to purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are very nice, I like them better than the other variety with the stick.  This is a great sample pack and the fragrances are actually all pretty good.  My favorite so far are the wood based ones, especially the cedarwood - it really smells like a fireplace or campfire to me.</li>
    <li> Disappointed !  It suppose come with variety scent , but smell the same to me and too smoky!!!</li>
    <li> The 1st thing i thought when i pulled these out of the box was WOW, these are SMALL.i was expecting a box a foot long with big boxes of insence, this was the size of a book. Taking out one of the sticks, another negative surprise awaited. they look like mechanical pencil sticks!    Then I put one in my burner, and was plesently surprised. no smoky smell like american insences, no extra bagage to make the stick look bigger and burn faster. this itsybitsy stick burned for over 1/2 an hour. deffinetly the best insence I have ever used. smells great, is cheap, and of great quality. I reccomend finding a store [if you can] that sells these in your area, as they are cheap but shiping costs are exorbant.]</li>
    <li> For such a little stick - it packs a great scent and very little smoke.  I bought 1 small box and was thrilled to find all 12 fragrances available in one order.  Thanks for Morning Star for the harmony you&#x27;ve added to our home.</li>
    <li> Overall, it is good.&lt;br /&gt;the scent is still a bit on the smoky side. I would expect it to be even lighter.&lt;br /&gt;it is made in Hong Kong, instead of Japan, which create a question mark in my mind.</li>
    <li> These sticks burn nicely, very subtle smell, not too overpowering but enough to provide enough to fill a large room.</li>
    <li> I cannot say these are bad. First off, if you want a powerful scent, these are not the ones for you, Hem and Satya do a far better job. These sticks have a light scent that does not cover a wide indoor area. For example, the Hem sticks I use had a 500 sq ft area smelling quite nice (1 stick alone) while the Morning star was detected in only half the space and very lightly at that. I hade to use several to get the same effect. However, with 50 in a box this was no problem. The stick are small and about 5 inches long and burn for about 20mins thought the box says 25mins. Not all the scents are appreciated but are good in allowing you to decide which one you will buy next time. Each box come with a small holder but it will not contain the ash. These incense have no wooden end piece to place in a standad holder and therefore, the one it comes with can be used and rest in something flat to catch the fine ashes. I would say these are good for those who meditate and so forth and want the incense in close proximity to them. Users like me who use it to add fragrance to part of a home may need to use another brand. Still give the 6 or 12 pack a try.</li>
    <li> Very nice scents, not over powering.</li>
    <li> I am not exactly a incense connoisseur, but these are just somehow better. They just smell nice and don&#x27;t smoke you out. Their size is perfect.</li>
    <li> These incenses are great. I was new to the incense world, and with so many different scents, I had no idea where to begin. This variety pack is awesome because it allowed me to dip my feet in the water and try out all of the different scents. While some of the scents do come off strong and aren&#x27;t my favorite, I am fond of a few others. Surprisingly I love the Green Tea incense. My other favorite was Amber. The fifty sticks per scent is more than enough, and each one comes with a little ceramic tile to hold it. Despite the thinness of each stick, they do produce enough smoke to fill a room with a pleasant and subtle aroma. I definitely recommend this variety pack for someone new to the incense world looking to get a taste of all of the different scents.</li>
    <li> What a great package is this ! 12 boxes of what I think are high quality and clean incense. 50 sticks per,and you get a sweet little stone tile in each box(12),as a burner. You place either end of the stick in the hole in the tile,light it,place it in an ash tray. Voila! Would be an awesome gift for your self,or far out friends!</li>
    <li> Great collection of scents. There are definitely some feminine and masculine scents here. I am very satified with my purchase. All of the incenses have a rich characteristic smell of the natural fragrance listed.</li>
    <li> These sticks wont let you down! I was a bit sketchy on them since they are so cheap, but after testing three scents, im convinced. These arent overwhelming at all. I use to use Nag Champa incense, but after I moved in with my mate and our new baby, we found Nag Champa was far too strong... These Morning Star are very comforting though! Green Tea is DELICIOUS smelling, its like im eating matcha ice cream. Cedarwood is refreshing, and clean smelling-maybe a bit minty even. Very satisfying. The Lavender is nice because its a bit weaker, very subtle- I find it relieving when stressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id also like to add that these incense concealed the smell of smoking legal herbs without the room reeking of either smoke or heavy scent.</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS (a.k.a. ALLWAYS) order morning start Patchouli.  Love it sooooo much that I never bothered trying any of the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  I always wanted to order this &amp; I finally did.&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli is still my all time fave, but there are a lot of other really sweet scents too.  Plus they come in individual 50 stick packs with their own incense burner so you can share (if you feel the need).</li>
    <li> This incense is very high quality - no extra smoke, easy to light.  Having 12 different scents gives you that many moods to choose for aromatherapy.  My current favorite is green tea.</li>
    <li> These are nice little sticks. Burning time is about 1/2 hour per stick. The smoke is not overwhelming like the bigger sticks. The little holders are nice to set up all over.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would like in this assortment, but at this price I thought even if I only liked a few boxes it would be money well spent. Turns out I like nearly every scent! I would buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a good way to try out every scent! I don&#x27;t like all the scents though, but I knew that I wouldn&#x27;t like all of them the same when I bought it. I love how clean these smell.</li>
    <li> These are pretty nice. Plenty of variety and came right on time. But some smell better than others as should be expected. The green tea was best in my opinion. Most of them smell pretty good. However... the scent isn&#x27;t very strong and it can smell a bit smoky. So don&#x27;t buy these if you&#x27;re looking to have them in a rather medium-ish large or larger room. These are good for most home uses though. Also, these are a bit on the pricey side in my opinion but you&#x27;re getting quite a lot so it&#x27;s really just me nitpicking on that one.</li>
    <li> Very nice starter package.Gives you the opportunity to explore the fragrances at a good price. Without this variety package I would have never bought the floral scents and I found out that I liked some.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect the product is exactly what I ordered. The quality of this insence is much better than what I thought. I think I even got it delivered a couple of days before the estimated delivery date. :)</li>
    <li> I am so happy to find the source for my favorite incense.  Previously, I have only purchased it in an out-of-state gift shop as I vacationed nearby.  This was faster and cheaper.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I had trouble finding a decent buy on Incense Matches that I&#x27;ve always kept in my bathroom.  I decided on these because they&#x27;re smaller/shorter than usual incense sticks.  There are...alright.  If I can&#x27;t get Incense Matches the next time around, I&#x27;d buy these again.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much difference scent-wise between them, they serve their purpose ~ controlling bathroom smells.</li>
