      <li>I love love this glue.</li>
      <li>Customer service was really good, product is ok, I was happy with the results til it stop sticking/holding and turned into a noticable white film after showering.</li>
      <li>I think if the stick was fix to adhere to the top</li>
      <li>, however when I return to the States I will get the product that I love.</li>
      <li>I got innovative and used disposable chopsticks as a wand and then have a twisting technique to break the strings and apply it to the tape.</li>
      <li>Once it gets on something it doesn&#x27;t come off easily either... unless it&#x27;s your lace.</li>

      <li>Been wearing full lace wigs for 6 years now non-stop.</li>
      <li>I would love to have it hold even one week straight.</li>
      <li>My mother gifted this to me along with a brand new lace wig.</li>
      <li>but removed easily when ready.</li>

      <li>But it holds great and last as long as some of the tapes.  </li>
      <li>It was my first time using the product.</li>

      <li>Time to try a new adhesive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking for something new</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold, after the first day at night when you wrap your hair it will slide your lace back.</li>
      <li>I recommend when you take the stick out to make sure you whip the brush around in small circular motions to get it to stay on the brush,otherwise you will have strings of glue everywhere.</li>
      <li>Complete waste of my money, didn&#x27;t even really do a good job of keeping the wig on my head and just made a mess</li>
      <li>Just yesterday ( 8 Mar 14), I had one side of my lace come completely unglued.</li>

<li> G Salon Pro 30 Sec Lace Wig Extreme Hold Bond 1 Oz]]</li>
<li> I have a supplier that I usually purchase from and when they did not have this in stock, I simply had to find you on line.</li>
<li> I wear my wig 24/7 and the Salon Pro 30 Sec Lace Wig Extreme Hold Bond does not let me down.</li>
<li> I have to touch up at least once a day and my unit keeps slipping back.</li>
<li> I used a different form of this brand before, it worked wonders, however this brand is a little hard to control.</li>
<li> It holds for about 2 and a half days before I have to make touch ups.</li>
<li> But it does stay on tight when glued.</li>
<li> It can&#x27;t even withstand a little moisture that seeps under a shower cap much less a little bead of sweat from just walking around.</li>
<li> Gives it a little traction so there will not be Any movement</li>
<li> Everyday I have to touch up the front where the glue is because it lifts</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like really messy</li>
<li> ROUND</li>
<li> It&#x27;s so sticky and messy a web connects the brush to the bottle and if you break the web with your hand it cannot be washed off.</li>
<li> And because it is a messy glue there was no way in correcting it with trouble.  </li>
<li> Sometimes I have to apply everyday.</li>
<li> For a beginner though I had to reapply a few times.</li>
<li> This product is way too messy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Customer service was really good, product is ok, I was happy with the results til it stop sticking/holding and turned into a noticable white film after showering. Note to self, wear 2 shower caps when going into the shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the local beauty supply store to bond my wig down and this product is garbage. Everyday I have to touch up the front where the glue is because it lifts and if I sweat from a workout or just from being in the sun...forget about it, this crap does not hold the wig in place. I just use the bobby-pin method and that keeps it in tact better than this \\&quot;glue\\&quot; does.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for awhile and can now purchase it at beauty supply stores as well.</li>
    <li> Not the best glue for lace wigs. Not a strong hold and a messy application regardless of your experience.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nasty and sticky... But it holds great and last as long as some of the tapes.  I gave it 3 stars because it&#x27;s hard to not get it in the hair and it&#x27;s stringy when applying...</li>
    <li> This product is way too messy. I tried my best to be careful with application, but still too messy.</li>
    <li> This is the only glue on the market that works for me.  I am not, I don&#x27;t think, particular &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34;; but nothing else holds.  I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars trying the others: GhostBond, 360Max Adhere; non of the white glues work for me.  This is my go to glue.  Been wearing full lace wigs for 6 years now non-stop.</li>
    <li> left my hair matted and white after applying to my hair and it ripped hair out of my edges do not buy and if you do i hope you have better luck with the product</li>
    <li> Works very well. For a beginner though I had to reapply a few times.</li>
    <li> messsssyyyyyyyyy but does the trick</li>
    <li> Bottle came half full and so hard it broke the brush that came with it. Don&#x27;t shop there. Hate it!</li>
    <li> I was allergic to this product will  not  purchase again did not know how to use it. must pay attention to instruction or you will have a problem with application.</li>
    <li> My mother gifted this to me along with a brand new lace wig. The applicator is not secured to the lid so it came right off when I was using it making a big mess on me and my wig. The glue is very stringy so it gets everywhere even if you try to be careful. Once it gets on something it doesn&#x27;t come off easily either... unless it&#x27;s your lace. Every day the front of my wig is coming up. It can&#x27;t even withstand a little moisture that seeps under a shower cap much less a little bead of sweat from just walking around. I&#x27;m looking for something new so I can toss this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/8/13&lt;br /&gt;It felt wasteful throwing out a whole bottle, so with the assistance of LaceFx tape, I managed to get this stuff to hold better. I got innovative and used disposable chopsticks as a wand and then have a twisting technique to break the strings and apply it to the tape. It holds for about 2 and a half days before I have to make touch ups. I got so good at doing it this way I decided to buy another bottle. I shouldn&#x27;t have to go to these lengths though. Up to 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I ADD HEAT TO INCREASE THE DRYING AND STICKING OF THE GLUE.  BE CAREFUL IT TURNS OFF WHITE, WHEN IT GETS WET, AND WILL COME LOSE IN WATER.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like really messy</li>
    <li> I love this stuff,  only disappointing thing is that the brush dislodged from the cap! Have to use a q-tip!</li>
    <li> This lace wig extreme, is good for keeping your wig sin place. Gives it a little traction so there will not be Any movement&lt;br /&gt;While you are wearing the wig. It will good to have the Pro 30 sec bond hold.</li>
    <li> The thing about this was that the stick brush came right out the first time using it.  And because it is a messy glue there was no way in correcting it with trouble.  I think if the stick was fix to adhere to the top it would not be a problem with this item.</li>
    <li> Fairly priced.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price I will recommend this to others it works just as advertised the soft bond holds gread</li>
    <li> Very messy and the top of my bottle broke the first time I opened it making the brush completely useless. Complete waste of my money, didn&#x27;t even really do a good job of keeping the wig on my head and just made a mess</li>
    <li> I have a supplier that I usually purchase from and when they did not have this in stock, I simply had to find you on line. I wear my wig 24/7 and the Salon Pro 30 Sec Lace Wig Extreme Hold Bond does not let me down. I also swim at the gym 4 days a week and I rely completely on Salon Pro to not let me down.[[ASIN:B00252ZJ1G Salon Pro 30 Sec Lace Wig Extreme Hold Bond 1 Oz]]</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, so sticky and gross</li>
    <li> I have to touch up at least once a day and my unit keeps slipping back. Time to try a new adhesive.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time love it I tell all my friend about it so it great that all I have to say</li>
    <li> yess this glue work!!...... if this does not stick your wig, it will stick your hair, your eyes, your fingers around. :P&lt;br /&gt;and can not be removed with water I recommend purchasing the solvent with it. is very good and very safe you can go to sea with a wig stick with this and does not slip at all...</li>
    <li> Great quality! Excellent seller!</li>
    <li> I love love this glue. It is the only glue that I have used and got the desired results I was looking for!</li>
    <li> The only glue I&#x27;ve used..however, it does get very stringy which gets into hair. But it does stay on tight when glued.</li>
    <li> kinda messy and sticky have to be very careful when using it sticks very well once you get pass the messyness</li>
    <li> I like this product for fast laying the lace and easy to come off.</li>
    <li> WORKS BEST ON FRESH CLEAN DRY SKIN. TRYING TO USE AS A TOUCHUP ONCE IT STARTS TO LOOSEN DOESN&#x27;T GIVE AS GOOD RESULTS. AS ALWAYS, TOO STRINGY.  I&#x27;VE MASTERED THAT PART BY BUYING A BAG OF ARTIST PAINT BRUSHES FROM WALMART AND MAKING SURE I SWIRL THE STRINGY PART OF THE SOLUTION ROUND THE BRUSH BEFORE MOVING TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE BOTTLE.</li>
    <li> I used a different form of this brand before, it worked wonders, however this brand is a little hard to control. It dries white and very sticky, the hold is iffy at best. I have good days and bad days with this product. If I had to reorder this I would because I have no choice because of my location, however when I return to the States I will get the product that I love. Just yesterday ( 8 Mar 14), I had one side of my lace come completely unglued. Overall if you can get this product to work properly lucky you. Ladies basically this product is a hit or miss.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s not extreme holding good. it only lasted about five or six days. but I will use it again.</li>
    <li> When it was delivered I could smell a strong odor on the envelope. When I opened it, I found that the cap hadn&#x27;t been put back on( for whatever reason it was taken off) and half the glue had spilled out.</li>
    <li> im a white girl and i have sensitive skin and as soon as i started sweating i broke out in a horrible rash even with the scalp protector so i cannot use it.. bummed out</li>
    <li> This gets in your blood through your skin and causes problems.</li>
    <li> It is a strong hold but not as long as a week for me as I sweat a lot and need to re attach</li>
    <li> This glue will rip hair from the front of your lace. It doesn&#x27;t hold, after the first day at night when you wrap your hair it will slide your lace back. It&#x27;s so sticky and messy a web connects the brush to the bottle and if you break the web with your hand it cannot be washed off. You will waste endless paper towels and bottles of alcohol just to get the stuff off your hands, because it will be all over your hands takes nearly 10-15 minutes to apply and will eventually glue all your hair together on your lace.</li>
    <li> the glue sticks like no tomorrow!..lol..but removed easily when ready. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This bond does exactly what the description says, it holds! I soaked my head in the shower with the wig on and after i got out the bond re-glued itself in less than a minute! I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Bottle was cracked when I got it</li>
    <li> Good quality, but it&#x27;s over priced.</li>
    <li> Very messy, not very easy or convenient for first time users. Hold lasted for a couple of days. Too much hassle to reapply. Ordered another product.</li>
    <li> It works exactly as discribed. I agree with the other comments you have to be careful using it. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for this kind of product and will be purchasing more. Thanks</li>
    <li> As long as the glue dries properly it will hold a few days. Sometimes I have to apply everyday. I would love to have it hold even one week straight.</li>
    <li> Well, it was a good product. The only issue is that it is truly overpriced on Amazon.com. When I went to my local hair store it was about $5 dollars cheaper. The next issue I had was that my top broke. Don&#x27;t ask me how because I don&#x27;t know nor do I understand. It was my first time using the product. I may need to have a little more experience using the product. I was doing the invisible hairline and on another note days later, the product is still very sticky. This may be because I used too much though. Next, time I will use less. Overall, it did the job that I was looking for, and for this reason I am satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware: The product can get very messy while using. I recommend when you take the stick out to make sure you whip the brush around in small circular motions to get it to stay on the brush,otherwise you will have strings of glue everywhere.</li>
