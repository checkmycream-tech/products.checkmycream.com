      <li>It&#x27;s a particularly nice scent</li>
      <li>A very nice, clean gender neutral smell.  </li>
      <li>I start most of my health/beauty product reviews by letting people know I am a licensed aesthetician and Panchakarma therapist, because I think it&#x27;s important for people to hear the opinion from someone who is experienced and knowledgeable in those areas.</li>
      <li>Good amount of fine bath salts for the price; everyone in our house likes the floral and earthy scents.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s more cost effective is like trying to replace butter with margarine.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the response I received when asking why more than 25% of it was already gone.</li>
      <li>The more appropriate description, would have been to leave the &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; term out all together.</li>
      <li>When I found that Amazon carries it, I was even more excited.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I could cry :)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve already fallen in love.</li>
      <li>In love in a tub.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
      <li>Wonderful bath salts to soak in after a long day</li>
      <li>Excellent to use as a soak after a long day at work!</li>
      <li>The scent is not fruity or strong, it is more like herbal and floral.</li>
      <li>When used, the color of the bath water is a beautiful bright green.</li>
      <li>Over all it was extremely relaxing and my skin feels great!</li>
      <li>also read in one review that the person claimed it was &amp;#34;way to strong in fragrance&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It surprises me how light and comfortable</li>
      <li>I think the muddy green smells wonderful, and turns the bath a really fun</li>
      <li>This variety of relaxing bath salts has a clean and forest like aroma.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy it very much!  </li>
      <li>It is still very pretty and relaxing.</li>
      <li>The salts were a bit tingly on my freshly shaven legs, but not painful at all.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a beautiful sea green color.</li>
      <li>This is a popular japanese bath salt brand.</li>
      <li>So that is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s a far better description than \\&quot;muddy green\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It really heats you up and definitely feels like you are getting a good detox.  </li>
      <li>She has eczema, this cleared it right up.</li>
      <li>Got this product yesterday and tried it right away.</li>
      <li>This is the first bath salt I have tried</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff!  </li>
      <li>If you like a really slick feeling in your bath, and go through bath salts quickly, these are a nice option.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure what exactly this is meant to do when bathing in it, it&#x27;s completely in japanese - HOWEVER, it makes my skin sooooo soft, and the water&#x27;s a fun opaque green color, AND it smells nice.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the theme of it</li>
      <li>Really helps my aches and pains.</li>
      <li>The rich bubbles and slick green color make bath time ever more enjoyable.</li>
      <li>I like this bath soak, mainly because I like the scent.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m thinking they were simply using way too much!!</li>
      <li>It is not difficult to clean, however, I do find the green stain to be a bit troublesome.</li>
      <li>first time I used this it was like i&#x27;d achieved the ultimate level of enlightenment...</li>
      <li>and I find that I can use a bit less than with other bath salts and still get a very nice bath in our deep tub.</li>
      <li>Neither feminine nor masculine, and your water will be a seafoam green.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The bath becomes a muted light green color.  </li>
      <li>the Yakusen Green Mineral Bath (Roman) to my &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; picks for 2015, since this is a sure catalyst for the ultimate relaxation, skin softener, and skin clearing.</li>
      <li>The water is a milky celadon green, though I was hoping for a rich matcha color.  </li>
      <li>So, I was privy to experience this particular &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; mineral bath, when a fellow colleague brought it back from Japan, and presented me this as a gift.</li>
      <li>The cloudy/milky look comes from the sodium bicarbonate, Japanese angelica root extract, and the Japanese mugwort, that are the main ingredients.</li>
      <li>And the scent definitely makes me get as much relaxation from a short bath time as possible.</li>
      <li>Those ingredients along with the salicylic acid, will only leave your skin soft and smoother in texture.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried substitutes for this product from Daiso Japan&#x27;s Bath Salts/Fragrances and let me tell you those products don&#x27;t come anywhere near this Japanese Mud Bath.</li>

    <li> I am a big time bath soaker and I was not prepared for the level of extreme relaxation that came with these bath salts.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little sad to see how small the tin was and was sad that it was beat to peices when I got it... But all was forgiven as soon as I soaked.&lt;br /&gt;Be warned... So relaxing I thought I was going to pass out!!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again. In love in a tub.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
    <li> Wonderful bath salts to soak in after a long day</li>
    <li> I can go on forever but I came across this while looking for a different one but am sock on this I well always have a can or two no I can not read Japanese but the pictures say it all I well always have pain after a bath stress and any pain well leave you and a heavily sent which I find to be unbelievable I could cry :)</li>
    <li> I love this bath salt!  I ordered this along with the muddy blue version.  Leaves my bath water a muddy green, without the muddy water consistency but rather a silky one instead.  Keeps the water warmer longer, beautiful scent which I&#x27;m getting a hint of apples (?) and something woodsy.  Best of all, it leaves my skin silky smooth afterwards.</li>
    <li> A very nice, clean gender neutral smell.  The water is a milky celadon green, though I was hoping for a rich matcha color.  It is still very pretty and relaxing.</li>
    <li> Like the muddy blue salts, a little goes a long way.  I think the muddy green smells wonderful, and turns the bath a really fun color- kind of like Doublemint Spearmint gum.  If you like a really slick feeling in your bath, and go through bath salts quickly, these are a nice option.</li>
    <li> Enjoy it very much!  Package was neatly packed and delivered from Japan. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This is a popular japanese bath salt brand. I use it to soak my feet and with bath. The scent is nice it works. The only thing I have to complain is the stain it leaves. It is not difficult to clean, however, I do find the green stain to be a bit troublesome. I am lazy... What can I say.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Every bath is a spa treatment!  Fragrant, silky and relaxing, I will order every fragrance again so I never run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again! It&#x27;s a hard task, putting into words the sheer nature of this product. The effect it had on me and everyone who&#x27;d sneakingly tried it after I&#x27;d taken my cleansing bath was....to put sum it up in one word...Breathtaking. That&#x27;s the response I received when asking why more than 25% of it was already gone. This was a truly breathtaking experience one would have to experience for themselves to really understand. I&#x27;ve tried substitutes for this product from Daiso Japan&#x27;s Bath Salts/Fragrances and let me tell you those products don&#x27;t come anywhere near this Japanese Mud Bath. To put it simply, trying to find a substitute for this that&#x27;s more cost effective is like trying to replace butter with margarine. Also, if you&#x27;re worried about the price, don&#x27;t be. You&#x27;re getting what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this it was like i&#x27;d achieved the ultimate level of enlightenment...like...&amp;#34;One with nothingness.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Really helps my aches and pains.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff!  I just pour a few tablespoons in the tub and then soak for at least 30 minutes. It really heats you up and definitely feels like you are getting a good detox.  Highly recommended. Oh and it smells AMAZING.</li>
    <li> This variety of relaxing bath salts has a clean and forest like aroma.  Excellent to use as a soak after a long day at work!</li>
    <li> When used, the color of the bath water is a beautiful bright green. The fragrance is fruity and very pleasant. The salts were a bit tingly on my freshly shaven legs, but not painful at all. After bathing, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to moisturize at all, which is a big deal for me! Over all it was extremely relaxing and my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> I start most of my health/beauty product reviews by letting people know I am a licensed aesthetician and Panchakarma therapist, because I think it&#x27;s important for people to hear the opinion from someone who is experienced and knowledgeable in those areas. So, I was privy to experience this particular &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; mineral bath, when a fellow colleague brought it back from Japan, and presented me this as a gift. She has eczema, this cleared it right up. When I found that Amazon carries it, I was even more excited.&lt;br /&gt;First, the &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; description is a little misleading, as a lot of people, before purchasing, worried it would leave scum/mud in their tubs. The more appropriate description, would have been to leave the &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; term out all together. The cloudy/milky look comes from the sodium bicarbonate, Japanese angelica root extract, and the Japanese mugwort, that are the main ingredients. There is never any residue left in my bath or on my skin for that matter. Those ingredients along with the salicylic acid, will only leave your skin soft and smoother in texture.&lt;br /&gt;I also read in one review that the person claimed it was &amp;#34;way to strong in fragrance&amp;#34;.... and I&#x27;m thinking they were simply using way too much!! There is 650 grams of product per canister, you only need 20 grams or 1/3c (use the green plastic lid as a measuring guide), per bath. This means you should easily get 32 uses out of each canister!!!! So that is well worth the price. The scent is not fruity or strong, it is more like herbal and floral. Think of a beautiful fragrant Jasmine tea! Neither feminine nor masculine, and your water will be a seafoam green.&lt;br /&gt;I have pinned* the Yakusen Green Mineral Bath (Roman) to my &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; picks for 2015, since this is a sure catalyst for the ultimate relaxation, skin softener, and skin clearing. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something to refresh yourself after getting exhausted from work, this product might be the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It surprises me how light and comfortable i feel after using it. And the scent definitely makes me get as much relaxation from a short bath time as possible.</li>
    <li> pleasant aroma and wonderful releaxe effect</li>
    <li> Got this product yesterday and tried it right away. I poured about two table spoon into tub water it&#x27;s a beautiful sea green color. But the color is not natural, I feel my skin so itaching afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is the first bath salt I have tried and I&#x27;ve already fallen in love. I use it along with Deep Steep bubble bath. The rich bubbles and slick green color make bath time ever more enjoyable. Try it. You deserve it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what exactly this is meant to do when bathing in it, it&#x27;s completely in japanese - HOWEVER, it makes my skin sooooo soft, and the water&#x27;s a fun opaque green color, AND it smells nice. I&#x27;m tempted to buy all the different varieties from this company.</li>
    <li> Good amount of fine bath salts for the price; everyone in our house likes the floral and earthy scents.  The bath becomes a muted light green color.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this bath soak, mainly because I like the scent.  I don&#x27;t really understand the theme of it but like it as a regular bath soak.</li>
    <li> Very interesting and soothing both to the soul and body.</li>
    <li> The Japanese on the back of the can actually says \\&quot;Fruity Green\\&quot; in katakana and that&#x27;s a far better description than \\&quot;muddy green\\&quot; (even though I realize it&#x27;s meant as a comparison to the benefits of the salts to the clouded water onsen). It&#x27;s a particularly nice scent and I find that I can use a bit less than with other bath salts and still get a very nice bath in our deep tub.</li>
