<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This little miracle in a jar is my new best friend. As a 40+ woman, I find it increasingly more important to take care of my skin from head to toe. This antioxidant eye cream is just what I need to do that. What&#x27;s best about it is the benefits it has for not only my face, but also for my neck and hands. I use it in the mornings and at night before bedtime. It has a long list of fabulous ingredients including green tea, lavender, and chamomile. The cream soothes and relaxes my skin as well as tightens and refines it. I have been telling all of my girlfriends about it. I could have kept this fountain of youth secret to myself, but they kept asking me what skin care I used. A must share!</li>
    <li> I may be a guy, but I like to moisturize.  Especially now that I am in my early 50&#x27;s and the crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines are really starting to show more than ever.  I know this product is marketed as an eye cream, but it is great for your whole face and neck.  It has helped tighten the skin reducing the lines around me eyes and it has helped with the dark circles under each eye as well.  The cream smells really good and is loaded with all natural ingredients so yor face is spared any harsh chemicals.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Finding a good cream that will actually moisturize and not break me out is a big deal for me! That’s why I’m so happy to discover this Beautifully Radiant Antioxidant cream. I am using it around my eyes and on my hands and I’m noticing a difference. My skin is feeling softer and brighter. I find that when I use it at night and in the morning, my skin looks better. This cream is very rich and I know that I am providing it with some much needed nutrients.</li>
    <li> What I like about this is at first glance is that most of the ingredients are proven to help smooth out skin, especially known ingredients such as aloe and sunflower oil. My coworker told me about this lotion and I looked it up here on amazon, and I could already tell it&#x27;s a reputable product based on all the reviews. I went ahead and ordered it, not from here though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now. The first week I already noticed that the surface of the skin seemed a lot smoother and a little whiter than usual. As for the eyes, there was no change. After 2 weeks of use, the puffiness around the eyes seemed to be reduced and a lot more more firm. The skin itself already was a little whiter but now has seemed to return to normal colors, but it&#x27;s not noticeable unless you look closely. Just by touching the skin, I&#x27;ve noticed that it feels tighter yet relaxed. I&#x27;ve never used a lotion dedicated to removing puffiness, but this one seems like it works well just based on 3 weeks of use. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re not looking to spend a lot but want results. The ingredients used in this lotion speak for themselves. I&#x27;ve seen other lotions that are double the price but the reviews don&#x27;t look too satisfying. This one is the one that stands out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, go for it and try it out.</li>
    <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking...why is this ugly bald bearded bloke doing buying women&#x27;s anti-oxidant eye cream? Isn&#x27;t it obvious? It&#x27;s because I need it. Despite the huge fierce beard and the rugged looks, I need to take care of my face. I&#x27;ve spent years outdoors and in military service subjecting my face to all manner of things from sun, to salt water, to smoke, and explosions and all the crap they throw around. Now that most of that is over (or at least on my own terms), it&#x27;s time to take care of myself. Because of my old adventuring days I&#x27;m now working a great deal as an actor and a beard model. I consider a good eye and face cream to be a regular part of my skin care regimen, and you should too. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, so go ahead and order a jar. You can tell them Dr. Dave sent you.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product and I love it!! This stuff smells amazing!  Everything in it is natural and the cream made my skin feel rehydrated and seemed to me to smooth out my skin tone.  It really makes a difference in the tone and texture of my skin!</li>
    <li> I work a graveyard shift and no matter how much sleep I get during the day my eyes often look puffy at work. I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed an improvement. The puffiness goes down almost immediately after applying and lasts for hours. The dark circles seem better too. I also like the smell, pleasant but not too strong. The texture is smooth but not greasy. I think it&#x27;s great value for its price!</li>
    <li> GREAT eye cream! I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She noticed reduction in the wrinkles and more of a glow from her face after just five days. That&#x27;s pretty incredible to me. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is so versatile, I use it on my face, neck, and chest too! The jar is rather large for a lotion, especially eye creams tend to be very very small. I love the scent and the feel when I put it on. I only use this, no other lotions. I cleanse, pat dry, apply lotion and i&#x27;m done. I tend to use this at night, as I prefer no lotions in the mornings. I have sensitive skin, but so far so good, no reactions or redzones.  Money back guarantees are fabulous, if you dont like it, just return it, no questions asked!</li>
    <li> I am writing this review on behalf of my girlfriend who absolutely swears by this product.  A couple months ago she was frustrated because she constantly had black rings around her eyes and could not seem to get rid of them.  She purchased this product and only a few days later the rings were quickly disappearing.  She was so much happier and had higher confidence in herself and her appearance.  I am delighted to see how happy she is, the change is extremely noticeable.  Overall, this product is safe and effective and does exactly as it claims.  It has without a doubt earned its place in the bathroom, and will surely be used from now on. .</li>
    <li> Beautifully Radiant&#x27;s eye cream is amazing! When I first received it I absolutely loved the smell and how large the product was. Not your average eye cream in small containers. I have been using it not just for my eyes but as my new face cream as well. Works wonders on my puffy eyes. I highly recommend giving this a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this eye cream based on a recommendation from a body shop employee and I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised. I had dark circles, fine lines and puffiness and since I have been using this product those problems are significantly less pronounced. In addition to keeping my under eye circles and puffiness at bay, the cream also moisturizes that part of my face. A little amount of this cream goes a long way and the jar will last you a while. Fully recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to keep the dark circles under my eyes at bay and a friend suggested I try this out. Not usually one for eye cream I finally caved and have to say that there has been a remarkable change. Gone is the look that I&#x27;ve spent the entire night not sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the ingredients are all natural is a bonus as while I&#x27;m not quite the 100% organic kind of person I do try to keep any additions to what I put in or on my body down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest this for anyone trying to keep dark circles from hanging out under their eyes!</li>
    <li> Works for sun aged skin. I have spent years working outside and it has taken its toll. I have tried other products in the past to reduce the fine lines and dryness of my skin. I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now I have noticed a difference in my fine lines in a short amount of time, especially the dry skin and appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. Thus far, the only one I&#x27;ve boughten on Amazon that show results after two weeks of using it. It did minimize my crows feet a bit, but what made this product a daily cream for me was the dark circles around my eyes. My were bad, i looked like a freaking mummy, for crying out loud. I noticed that they are no longer this deep brown rings, now they are about 50% lighter and i&#x27;m only halfways through the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So, thus far, great product. If any changes occur, i&#x27;ll make sure to come back and update this review.</li>
    <li> This Antioxidant eye cream by Beautifully Radiant was delivered sealed and protectively packaged, and was as described on product page.  We received the eye cream in a promotion for personal use, honest evaluation and review.  I have dark circles under my eyes, and have tried multiple products to diminish the unsightly circles and puffiness.  This antioxidant eye cream contains Matrixyl 3000 + Tripeptide-5 + retinol which helps to increase collagen production, minimizes wrinkles and age spots.  The cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly.  I have been applying for a very short while, and though I have not seen results yet, I am hopeful, and will update this review with any further findings.</li>
    <li> There are three places on my face that are instant indicators of age: my eyes, my forehead and right around my mouth. You can usually instantly tell if I’m not well hydrated or aren’t feeling well at these spots. Using this cream has made that easier to manage than ever! It really isn’t “just” for eyes!</li>

    <li> This is great face cream! A friend of mine gave me her container because she found out she has a reaction to sunflowers and their oil.&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought I&#x27;d try it. Its very smooth, feels soft and moisturizes my skin. It has helped with my wrinkles and makes my skin look and&lt;br /&gt;feel younger. I have been using it before I go to bed at night so I can wake up with beautiful skin. I recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this a gift for my grandmother. She is in love with this product, and has refought several times. She loves that this eye cream rejuvenates her skin cells, and help reverse some of her wrinkles. It is a great gift idea for those whoo need some help with their skin!</li>
    <li> I am 26 and have really bad crows feet. It makes it hard for me to take photos of myself because I look a lot older because of them. After a few applications I noticed the lines receding. At this time they are hardly noticeable and I look my age for once. This is a wonderful product and I will buy again when this jar is gone!</li>
    <li> I am an eye cream junkie.  I will try anything that says it will eliminate fine lines, and most of the time I&#x27;m completely disappointed.  I tried this on a recommendation from a friend, and I find the title of the product itself is absolutely true.  I&#x27;ve thrown away every other eye cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased because this one is the best!  Not only does it dramatically reduce fine lines, my skin feels hydrated and it really smells nice.  It goes on smooth without feeling goopy on my eyes, and I like that it absorbs so well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Beautifully Radiant eye cream.</li>
    <li> i stumbled upon this amazing eye cream and it literally is the best I have used in ages.  I love how it makes my eyes brighter and best of all those annoying bags are gone!  The fine lines around my eyes literally vanish and the best thing about this product is that my skin is becoming much more healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many products that make these type of promises but this is the rare exception that works just like the product claims and the price is simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully Radiant is a true gem and a product I will continue to use daily.</li>
    <li> Great smooth silky cream. It is so luscious!  I love the feel of this Beautifully Radiant eye cream. It comes in a lovely jar in a box. Very nice presentation. The ingredients are actually things I have heard of. Retinol, aloe, lots of different natural oils, apple, lemon &amp; lots more. I put this under my eyes, on my elbows, hands &amp; cuticles. I will probably save it for just under my eyes.  I wish I had a gallon of this. I love the slight scent also. I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. I&#x27;m so glad. With all of the creams out there-I might not have run across this! Thank You!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing !!!!! This is a wonderful anti-oxident eye cream that can be used under the eyes but I use it all over my face because I love the silky feel and how it absorbs so well into my skin. Used daily, I have noticed a diminished look of the fine lines around my eyes and lips and my skin feels healthier and toned. Results seem to be based on daily use. This comes nicely packaged and includes high quality ingredients including Retinol and Tripeptide-5. A wonderful product that I will continue to use. Oh, and it is a nice sized jar too and I feel this will easily last 2-3 months because a little goes a long way. The fact that the ingredients are all natural is a bonus as while I&#x27;m not quite the 100% organic kind of person I do try to keep any additions to what I put in or on my body down.  I highly suggest this for anyone trying to keep dark circles from hanging out under their eyes!</li>
    <li> I am excited about the results I am seeing with this face moisturizer and eye cream. The cream is organic and natural and is loaded with antioxidants. I am particularly concerned about the wrinkle lines around my mouth and eyes . My skin is very dry due to extreme hypothyroidism . The product feel great on my skin and really hydrates it. I am an active 66 year old and anything that can repair skin damage and prevent any more wrinkles and fine lines is something I am willing to try. I am using this product twice a day and can already feel my skin is softer and firmer. Cream is easily absorbed and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive and I have used this product without any problems. I am always on the hunt for products to moisturizer my skin and products to use around my eyes. My eyes have dark circles under them and stay swollen due to my thyroid condition. Since using this eye cream I have noticed a big difference around my eyes and mouth. I can&#x27;t wait to see how things progress with continued use. I am pleased to have received this product as a discounted price. My experience has been positive and I will continue to use this amazing product by Beautifully Radiant. Great product and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I had never noticed wrinkles on my face or bags under my eyes until the past few years.  I am over forty and live in a place that is predominantly sunny so figured that it was time to start using something on my face at night.  This is the best antioxidant eye cream that I have found.  One container of this stuff lasts a really long time, I have noticed a marked difference in the wrinkles and even softness of my skin and there isn&#x27;t any greasy consistency like you can find with some of the other creams.  Will definitely continue to use this one.</li>
    <li> After reading the description of this product and seeing the low price for it, I had to give it a shot. I am very happy I did. I don&#x27;t use a lot of different products, but I do need a nice cream for my dry skin that didn&#x27;t clog it all up. This product delivers in that aspect. I break out really easy when trying a new product but I had no break outs with this. Even better I look more refreshed in the morning (even if I still feel like a zombie) no one would ever know.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it has a lot of natural ingredients. I just want a fresh glowing complexion without having to pay through the nose for it and Beautifully Radiant&#x27;s NEW Antioxidant Eye Cream does just that. And if you are not fully satisfied after using it for 30 days they will refund your money! What could be better than that!!  But really, it is worth it compared to all those others charging 3 times as much.</li>
    <li> This cream is rich and soothing enough to apply to just about any dry spot.  For the price, I don&#x27;t have to save it just for my eyes.  I like this cream for good visible results and it feels great on my skin.  When purchasing any skin cream for wrinkles, if it has retinol it is bound to work.  This antioxidant cream not only has retinol to help with wrinkles, but also other ingredients that make your skin feel luxurious and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a good eye cream for the price. I have tried lots of different creams over the years, ranging from very expensive to the lower priced one. This is a great value.  I have puffiness around my eyes, and this cream helps.  I am always sensitive to the way beauty products smell, and this one has a nice pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream over the winter when we had some really low temperatures- like around -20 F degrees. My skin tends to be very very dry and needs a lot of love during the holiday season. I had decided to try a new brand of moisturizer and found this one. I wanted something that would be moisturizing but also brighten my skin, since I have both old acne scars that cause a bit of discoloration as well as something to brighten up the dark circles under my eyes. I just always seem to have issues with both of those things and makeup doesn&#x27;t always help- especially if my skin keeps drying out. I really really like this moisturizer. It helped perk up my skin even in very cold conditions, when it would otherwise make me look very tired. My sister and I met for lunch and she said my skin was glowing! I would definitely recommend this cream!</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it smells fresh and natural, perfect base for my makeup. I use it all over my face and neck day and night. My Skin feels Young again ! I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite products.  I love eye creams.  I am always trying new ones.  Eye cream is important to help prevent bags, dark circles and crows feet.  This cream is thick and smells good.  It worked well under my eyes and kept them moisturized the whole day even with my makeup on top of it.  It is not greasy or oily feeling which is a major plus in my book.  I like to feel hydrated not oily.&lt;br /&gt;Although I can&#x27;t disclose how well this item works I can only tell you that it is very comparable to all high end eye creams and anyone would benefit greatly from this item if used on a daily basis.  You can apply  this 2 times a day morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend everybody have a jar of this in their bathroom. Great product! High quality cream.  Fast shipping and packaged with care.&lt;br /&gt;This would make an excellent gift for someone&#x27;s as its packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to write my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Yes, yes, yes...HELLS YES.  I have changed shifts at work recently and was feeling extra puffy and beat up.  We&#x27;ve had an exceptionally dry summer and my skin has been icky and my eyes have been puffballs.  This is so smooth, lovely, and effective.  Reduced the puffiness quickly and also, as a side benefit, has really done a nice job on the crowsfeet that I&#x27;m still in denial about.  Great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this eye cream  twice already and I cannot give it up! I find it really amazing, because  few applications are enough to see results.&lt;br /&gt;Eye contour is a very delicate part of our face, so it can&#x27;t be treated with a normal face cream, but with a more specific and sensitive one. This in particular has a fundamental ingredient: retinol, very important to fight against signs of aging related to oxidant agents and free radicals. Furthermore, formulation is 70% organic, then it&#x27;s rich in natural products and low in harmful chemicals, and that makes it even more suitable for&lt;br /&gt;sensitive skin, like mine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really satisfied and I will definitely continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams, from drugstore creams to very expensive ones that didn&#x27;t really do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;I also used coconut oil for my eyes and face for a long time because I became disillusioned with the modern cosmetics and their chemicals-filled products. I decided to try this eye cream after seeing that it also has coconut oil-I wanted to have something natural in my new product. This cream was recommended to me and after checking the rest of the ingredients I realized this might actually by a really effective product- it not only has natural ingredients like jojoba oil, palm oil, and vitamin C, it&#x27;s also full of antioxidants.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and I&#x27;m loving it! I get the same benefit form it as from natural oils that I used to use and more! It is packed with all the right ingredients. It&#x27;s not too oily, it&#x27;s easy to use and finally I notice a difference between having and not having it on my skin. I also use it for the rest of my face now and don&#x27;t want to purchase anything else for a while. I strongly recommend trying this cream as it&#x27;s very natural and you can see the results!</li>
