      <li>So glad i could find it here.</li>
      <li>I HAVE RECOMENDED IT TO MANY PEOPLE, AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.</li>
      <li>so glad to find a case of it online.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair a healthy shine, the curls bounce</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t get the same excellent results.  </li>
      <li>, I need to be able to get the tangles out of my curls.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping this one isn&#x27;t on the way out too because I can&#x27;t easily find it in stores now...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d imagine it would build up really easily as a leave</li>
      <li>I have fairly fine hair, but curly if layered when cut.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already noticed a tremendous change in my hair, it&#x27;s softer, hydrated and my curls are looking a lot healthier!</li>
      <li>Easy to rinse clean.</li>
      <li>It works great for me, especially in the humid weather.  </li>
      <li>I was able to buy it in large quantities on amazon!</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair and this is the most economical, high quality conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried that gives me such great results.</li>
      <li>Wow, I love it!  </li>
      <li>All in all, this conditioner is cheap and worth a shot.</li>
      <li>or if it&#x27;s just that so many people are wearing their hair straight right now that the demand isn&#x27;t there</li>
      <li>(The shampoo is good too, but I&#x27;ve found I can use almost any shampoo as long as I chase it with this conditioner.)  </li>
      <li>smell doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;linger\\&quot; that much, but you CAN smell it after it dries, BUT it&#x27;s not offensive or too strong.</li>
      <li>Shame on you for discontinuing such an amazing product.  </li>
      <li>Still worth it, but don&#x27;t play us.</li>
      <li>If you have naturally curly hair, you will love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>thee only kind I ever use then</li>
      <li>Although, the original bottles had a few more ounces :).  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just flat out amazing.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner gives just the right amount of detangling and frizz prevention without leaving the grease effect.  </li>
      <li>And speaking of money, I am quite sure this product retails for less than $3 for an 12.6 oz bottle, and I hope to see fairer pricing on this on Amazon soon - better than what I&#x27;m paying for my six pack today, about $4/bottle.  </li>
      <li>It makes them good and tight.</li>
      <li>I have long, curly, fine textured hair and have always had problems finding shampoo and conditioner that keeps my hair tangle free without leaving it looking like a greasy version of Cousin It by days end.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite conditioner and I cannot  find it in any store anymore, so I will definitely buy it from Amazon again.</li>
      <li>My 17 year old daughter has long curly hair and has loved this conditioner for years.</li>
      <li>Frankly, every time I have found a good one, it disappears after a few years or switches the formula.  </li>
      <li>I have used MANY other brands such as CurlySexyHair, Aquage, etc----they cost way more</li>
      <li>It was really frizzy and seemed like it did things on it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Plus I feel the price is really cheap, considering you get 75.6 oz of conditioner (6 x 12.6) for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I gave this product just 4 stars because it has so much</li>
      <li>Thank You so much</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>few years ago Pantene switched their curly conditioner formula and thus began my latest replacement search, and I was thrilled to find this product worked every bit as well for less money.  </li>
      <li>I guess as companies make new product, they have to stop stocking older items.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many expensive shampoos and conditioners for curly hair and this is by far my favorite</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s 5 stars if you regularly shampoo with a sulfate, but as I rarely use one..</li>
      <li>Need new product?</li>
      <li>This conditioner is light and does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
      <li>- I use the shampoo-conditioner-styling gel combo and it looks natural and has no stiffness or heaviness to it.  </li>
      <li>It is thick, smells kinda like Baby Magic baby lotion or Johnsons.</li>
      <li>Buy the single bottle first</li>
      <li>This is the only shampoo that works well with my naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>the shampoo 2-3 times a week to let my natural oils help moisturize, and I use the Suave Conditioner daily.</li>
      <li>Some days it&#x27;s really curly, other days its just wavy.</li>
      <li>I have natural African American hair that is type 4 with low porosity.</li>
      <li>I have slightly used bottles of expensive brand name products filling my closet because I love this conditioner so much.</li>

<li> This conditioner defines your curls and make less frizz, but if you&#x27;re worried about shrinkage, you&#x27;re gonna have shrinkage with this BECAUSE it defines the curls so well.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s almost like a typical Suave product.</li>
<li> The frustrating point is Suave has chosen to drop this shampoo and conditioner and only continue making the styling products for the line.</li>

<li> Sadly, after the last bottle from this order there may be no more as Suave has discontinued it.</li>
<li> The nicest, least frizz curls</li>
<li> I have extremely thick and curly hair.</li>
<li> So I say that this shampoo can&#x27;t be purhased in stores because for some ridiculous reason they discontinued it.</li>
<li> RIDICULOUS reason I will repeat.  </li>
<li> It won&#x27;t make you sick or anything, but you can smell it after it</li>
<li> Was unhappy when I couldn&#x27;t find this type of shampoos in ANY store!  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m so disappointed that Suave discontinued making it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A+. This is my favorite conditioner and I cannot  find it in any store anymore, so I will definitely buy it from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many expensive shampoos and conditioners for curly hair and this is by far my favorite and I had to buy online because I can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s disappeared from all of the stores I shop at, but I love it along with the shampoo and mousse.  Thank goodness I was able to buy it in large quantities on amazon!</li>
    <li> Was unhappy when I couldn&#x27;t find this type of shampoos in ANY store!  So thrilled! I now have enough for about 6 months!</li>
    <li> If you have naturally curly hair, you will love this shampoo.  It lets your hair curl without the frizz.  I can&#x27;t believe the price. More expensive products don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly hair and this is the most economical, high quality conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried that gives me such great results. I have slightly used bottles of expensive brand name products filling my closet because I love this conditioner so much.</li>
    <li> I guess as companies make new product, they have to stop stocking older items.  I love this formula for conditioner and shampoo that is made for curls but I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore at my local stores.  I was happy to find it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love it - Bought 12 bottles - my daughter has lovely curly hair.  Works the best.  Easy to rinse clean.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have very long hair and need a conditioner.  This one doesn&#x27;t make my hair greesy.</li>
    <li> thee only kind I ever use then the srtores stopped selling it. So glad i could find it here.Thank You so much</li>
    <li> My 17 year old daughter has long curly hair and has loved this conditioner for years. Sadly, after the last bottle from this order there may be no more as Suave has discontinued it.</li>
    <li> My daughters love this shampoo/conditioner for their curly hair.  It works great and I&#x27;m so disappointed that Suave discontinued making it.  Very glad I found the 6 pack on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Try this conditioner. I haven&#x27;t tried the shampoo, as I&#x27;m a cowasher. I gave this product just 4 stars because it has so much dimethicone- BUT for some that may be a reason to give it FIVE stars. It&#x27;s 5 stars if you regularly shampoo with a sulfate, but as I rarely use one.. Four for me. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as for the technicals. I have natural African American hair that is type 4 with low porosity. This conditioner defines your curls and make less frizz, but if you&#x27;re worried about shrinkage, you&#x27;re gonna have shrinkage with this BECAUSE it defines the curls so well. It makes them good and tight. I have a TWA right now, so shrinkage REALLY shows, if your hair is heavier and longer, it may not be so bad. All in all, this conditioner is cheap and worth a shot. It is thick, smells kinda like Baby Magic baby lotion or Johnsons. It has a texture of baby lotion as well. (It may BE baby lotion!! LoL!)The smell doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;linger\\&quot; that much, but you CAN smell it after it dries, BUT it&#x27;s not offensive or too strong. It&#x27;s almost like a typical Suave product. Has that Suave smell. It&#x27;s good.. It won&#x27;t make you sick or anything, but you can smell it after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a leave in, I&#x27;d rinse it all out because of the dimethicone. I&#x27;d imagine it would build up really easily as a leave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, before I get too long winded here, I&#x27;ll end with give it a shot. Buy the single bottle first and if you like it, get the six pack. :)</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that works well with my naturally curly hair.  But, there are no stores that carry it anymore; you can only purchase the mousse.  It works great for me, especially in the humid weather.  Thank you Amazon for having these products !!</li>
    <li> You can not find this product anymore in local retail stores.  So I found it here online.  I like the result I get from it, I have permed/wavy hair and need this type of conditioner.  I like the kind that has more lather to it, I need to be able to get the tangles out of my curls.  This is one of the few brands that is that way.  It has a great smell too.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love it!  I actually ordered several different well-rated curly hair or anti-frizz shampoos and conditioners, this one is the winner.  The nicest, least frizz curls - I use the shampoo-conditioner-styling gel combo and it looks natural and has no stiffness or heaviness to it.  I hope this product sticks around!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about two years now, and it is the best for curly hair!  It leaves my curls soft and not weighed down.  I have used MANY other brands such as CurlySexyHair, Aquage, etc----they cost way more but I don&#x27;t get the same excellent results.  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve been around the block on conditioners for curly hair.  Frankly, every time I have found a good one, it disappears after a few years or switches the formula.  I&#x27;m hoping this one isn&#x27;t on the way out too because I can&#x27;t easily find it in stores now... don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a manufacturing issue or if it&#x27;s just that so many people are wearing their hair straight right now that the demand isn&#x27;t there so stores aren&#x27;t stocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever, this conditioner smells nice without lingering, is silky so you can run your fingers through your hair to detangle in the shower, and it leaves my curls shiny and defined.  (The shampoo is good too, but I&#x27;ve found I can use almost any shampoo as long as I chase it with this conditioner.)  There&#x27;s no \\&quot;weigh down\\&quot; effect either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago Pantene switched their curly conditioner formula and thus began my latest replacement search, and I was thrilled to find this product worked every bit as well for less money.  And speaking of money, I am quite sure this product retails for less than $3 for an 12.6 oz bottle, and I hope to see fairer pricing on this on Amazon soon - better than what I&#x27;m paying for my six pack today, about $4/bottle.  Still worth it, but don&#x27;t play us.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so glad to find a case of it online. Works great on my naturally curly hair</li>

    <li> I found the condiditioner heavy even with Texas hardwater, the conditioner left a residue felling on my hair even after two rinses.</li>
    <li> This should come back to stores ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WHY  did you discontinue?  Low sales? Need new product? What?  So change the packaging, market this again people!!!  I get ALOT of compliments on my hair.  &amp;#34;I love your curls! Your hair is so shiny, what do you use?&amp;#34;  So I say that this shampoo can&#x27;t be purhased in stores because for some ridiculous reason they discontinued it. RIDICULOUS reason I will repeat.  Shame on you for discontinuing such an amazing product.  NOTHING out there is better for curly hair.  It gives my hair a healthy shine, the curls bounce it&#x27;s just flat out amazing.  It&#x27;s not heavy, it smells great!!!  Bring it back!  Although, the original bottles had a few more ounces :).  I bought two boxes of each; shampoo and conditioner.  I tried the others they have now....nope, not even close.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find in a local store anywhere, it appears that Suave doesn&#x27;t ship anymore?  I have fairly fine hair, but curly if layered when cut.  This conditioner is light and does not weigh my hair down.  I have masses of curls without doing anything but washing and &amp;#34;fluffing&amp;#34; with my hand.  Good to go all day and looks great.</li>
    <li> SUAVE SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE TRIED, THE PRICE IS WHY I TRIED IT. I HAVE RECOMENDED IT TO MANY PEOPLE, AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.</li>
    <li> Suave needs to stop messing with it&#x27;s products.  I can&#x27;t get this in the stores anymore and I love it.</li>
    <li> Product overpriced due to lack of supply from the manufacturer. In any case my wife was grateful that I found it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick and curly hair. Before I started using this shampoo and conditioner I wasn&#x27;t able to control my hair! It was really frizzy and seemed like it did things on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use the shampoo 2-3 times a week to let my natural oils help moisturize, and I use the Suave Conditioner daily. I&#x27;ve already noticed a tremendous change in my hair, it&#x27;s softer, hydrated and my curls are looking a lot healthier! I even started to get more compliments on my hair! Plus I feel the price is really cheap, considering you get 75.6 oz of conditioner (6 x 12.6) for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the shampoo as well!</li>
    <li> It makes my wavy hair lay in curls, love it!! Please bring it back to stores!! Shipment was perfect, no problems!!</li>
    <li> My hair is curly, but temperamental. Some days it&#x27;s really curly, other days its just wavy. This Captivating curls shampoo and conditioner is my secret weapon! Perfect curls every time!</li>
