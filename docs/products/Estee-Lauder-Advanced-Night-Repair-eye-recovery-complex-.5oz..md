      <li>I have bought all over serums before and of course I love moisturizers and face oils.</li>
      <li>After 1 week of using this eye cream I noticed that the lines under my eyes seemed softer and after two weeks the undereye area was no longer sunken but plump and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>To some up, I was expecting a lot more based on the price and the supposed research and engineering that went into development.     </li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>nice item my friend love it very much</li>
      <li>i am not american but this product is really good, i can&#x27;t not use nicely word to show it.</li>
      <li>I got this free sample in a Macy&#x27;s gift with purchase.</li>
      <li>but after a while yes and of course I do recommend to use with the facial night cream works great when you use both and</li>
      <li>And i got free sample or discount when shopping from Estée Lauder website.</li>
      <li>the price I think is good enough :)</li>
      <li>, I was I requested, all was ok, thanks a lot for all, I will buying more</li>
      <li>in original package too.</li>
      <li>After about 10 applications I began to notice the puffiness was significantly reduced,</li>
      <li>But it is consistent and does make by eye area more moisturized.  </li>
      <li>this is great product you wont see big change right the way</li>
      <li>all was ok thanks</li>
      <li>Estee Lauder really cares about our skin, plus It was shipped in time,  Im completely satisfied,</li>
      <li>in about a month and a half puffiness was greatly reduced.  </li>
      <li>But this cream really stands out for me, it&#x27;s velvety smooth</li>
      <li>the product come so soon i like how to work so many people near to me</li>
      <li>This eye cream is definitely worth the price</li>
      <li>first impression</li>
      <li>Yet, from the first application I could see a visible difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its a wonderfull experience and it really works!</li>
      <li>even though my sleeping habits hadn&#x27;t really changed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Guess what, none work very well.  </li>
      <li>It Is very moisture and chiper than in Korea.</li>
      <li>Even after nightly use for over six months, the lines around the corners of my eyes (that will one day be crows feet) are still very visible</li>
      <li>I really really like it and am considering buying it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>But my main challenge was under eye puffiness.</li>
      <li>I spent a good amount of money on other stuff that didn&#x27;t work until I saw this was still being made.  </li>
      <li>I have to say its a pretty good cream, but i have since found other creams that work just as well for alot less!</li>
      <li>It is very different with the one purchased from Estee Lauder E-shop.&lt;br /&gt;After opening its package,the bottle is very dirty,it has different font ,and it is very indistinct,but the font of the real one is very clear.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My local beauty supply store recommended a moisturizer by a very natural line (think Burts Bees) which left my eye area red and swollen, and that&#x27;s with no artificial ingredients!!  </li>
      <li>Being I had used it once in my early 20s</li>
      <li>I am in my early 20s and have had lines around my eyes since I was 12 due to the way I smile.</li>
      <li>Love night repair, but not sure i need something different for my eyes compared to the basic serum.</li>
      <li>Every drugstore line now brags an eye product to &amp;#34;moisturize, de-puff bags, moisturize, brighten, erase wrinkles and lines and generally take years off your eyes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Been a fan since I was 26 now I am 41 and I don&#x27;t look 41 - Gym,Dance,Great sex with my man,Beach Volleyball and ESTEE LAUDER</li>
    <li> I used this product for  little over six months with less than stellar results. I am in my early 20s and have had lines around my eyes since I was 12 due to the way I smile. Even after nightly use for over six months, the lines around the corners of my eyes (that will one day be crows feet) are still very visible and  I have seen no reduction what so ever. I did have fain dark circles under my eyes that have faded slightly with the use of the product. To some up, I was expecting a lot more based on the price and the supposed research and engineering that went into development.     I will up and date as I still have some left, but don&#x27;t waste your money this isn&#x27;t a miracle formula.</li>
    <li> I am sorry. i am not american but this product is really good, i can&#x27;t not use nicely word to show it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, but paid a lot more  for it else where.  It is the same product and people think that I am in my 50&#x27;s, but I am going to be 70 in November.  I use all of elste lauder on my face not just this item.</li>
    <li> Its a wonderfull experience and it really works! Estee Lauder really cares about our skin, plus It was shipped in time,  Im completely satisfied,</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that this product was still sold.  Being I had used it once in my early 20s I just figured it was no longer made.  I spent a good amount of money on other stuff that didn&#x27;t work until I saw this was still being made.  Same results as I had a decade ago. Within a month, the dark circles start to fade from the outer part of the under-eye.  in about a month and a half puffiness was greatly reduced.  In 2 months, I&#x27;m no longer using foundation. within 5 months I&#x27;m out and I look so good I almost forgot why I bought it(but I&#x27;m not making that mistake again).  Good results and preservation.  It does what it says.</li>
    <li> all was ok thanks, I was I requested, all was ok, thanks a lot for all, I will buying more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very good at consistently applying this cream. I tend to skip a night or two every week. Yet, from the first application I could see a visible difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first impression, it seemed to reduce dark circles and then gradually fade them almost completely out of view. But my main challenge was under eye puffiness. I travel a lot and often don&#x27;t get enough sleep. After about 10 applications I began to notice the puffiness was significantly reduced, even though my sleeping habits hadn&#x27;t really changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really very impressed. I wonder what it can actually do if I remember to apply it regularly and manage to get 8 hours of sleep on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. It is pity that there was no free sample this time. And i got free sample or discount when shopping from Estée Lauder website.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Great moisturizing, easy to use. Only takes a small amount. Softens lines and wrinkles, and lightens under eye circles. Younger looking eyes, softer lines etc... after about 1 month of daily use for me. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Box arrived damaged. The inside box was wet. The product jar was in tact or so I thought. I opened it and it smelled like it was tampered with. Totally disappointed with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Best eye gel/cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> felt good with this experience. it arrived soon after i purchased and the product was great. so i would recommend it</li>
    <li> Love night repair, but not sure i need something different for my eyes compared to the basic serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 41 and have been using drugstore moisturizers for years.  I had noticed over the last few months that my under eye area seemed sunken and the lines under my eyes were glaringly obvious (to me anyway)and I just looked tired all of the time.  Well help was definitely needed so on the recommendation of a friend I bought several of EL&#x27;s skincare products.  I&#x27;d been skeptical of eye creams as I&#x27;d tried many (again all drugstore brands) and never saw any change.  After 1 week of using this eye cream I noticed that the lines under my eyes seemed softer and after two weeks the undereye area was no longer sunken but plump and healthy looking.  I still have slight dark circles but I didn&#x27;t expect that this product would address that, I don&#x27;t know of anything that does so I just conceal.  This eye cream is definitely worth the price and I will buy again, it actually works!!!</li>
    <li> It is very different with the one purchased from Estee Lauder E-shop.&lt;br /&gt;After opening its package,the bottle is very dirty,it has different font ,and it is very indistinct,but the font of the real one is very clear.&lt;br /&gt;The shape of these two bottles are also a little different.</li>
    <li> I have to say its a pretty good cream, but i have since found other creams that work just as well for alot less! This one is just a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I went on an austerity kick and decided there had to be something less expensive yet as effective.  My local beauty supply store recommended a moisturizer by a very natural line (think Burts Bees) which left my eye area red and swollen, and that&#x27;s with no artificial ingredients!!  Every drugstore line now brags an eye product to &amp;#34;moisturize, de-puff bags, moisturize, brighten, erase wrinkles and lines and generally take years off your eyes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Most are at a cost of about $25.00 a pop.  Guess what, none work very well.  OK, it&#x27;s not perfect, and it doesn&#x27;t take off 20 years.  But it is consistent and does make by eye area more moisturized.  I&#x27;ve added day application to the night time, and I&#x27;ve seen more of an effect.  My advice, cut back somewhere else but keep using this product if you already like it.  If not, try it.</li>
    <li> It Is very moisture and chiper than in Korea.</li>
    <li> this is great product you wont see big change right the way but after a while yes and of course I do recommend to use with the facial night cream works great when you use both and the price I think is good enough :)</li>
    <li> I like it. I got this free sample in a Macy&#x27;s gift with purchase. I have used it now for a week. I really really like it and am considering buying it. Typically I don&#x27;t use just eye treatments. I have bought all over serums before and of course I love moisturizers and face oils. But this cream really stands out for me, it&#x27;s velvety smooth and my eyes feel happy with it on. I use it morning and night since I feel my under eyes are fragile they can use all the help they can get with makeup tugging at them etc.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this product.  loves the texture and thickness of the creme.  she was so upset when she ran out of her supply.</li>
    <li> the product come so soon i like how to work so many people near to me want one for then, i wil tray again</li>
    <li> Wife loves this and it is sometimes hard to find.  Got a lot sooner than estimated.  in original package too.</li>
    <li> It is not producing what I want.</li>
    <li> nice item my friend love it very much</li>
