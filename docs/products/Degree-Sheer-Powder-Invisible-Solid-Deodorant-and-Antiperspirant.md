<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i like this woman antiperspirant verry much, it smells good and work excelent. thank you for it. i&#x27;ll get it more i think</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years, and I just love it.  It always keeps up with me, and keeps the stinks away!  The sheer powder scent is perfect because I always feel with other scents that they make me smellier.  Sheer powder keeps me smelling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I sweat/perspire easily. Degree antiperspirant and deodorant has worked like a champ. It&#x27;s a great deodorant and I use it every day, even when it&#x27;s cold outside.</li>
    <li> I purchase these through Subscribe and Save.  You can&#x27;t buy them at a lower price and they come to your door.  I live in Texas so it&#x27;s really hot there and Degree has always worked great for me.</li>
    <li> What a great price on a high quality, necessary product. The free 2 day shipping with prime or subscribe and save is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> This is actually a review for this deodorant but with the body responsive. It it much clearer than other products and has soft absorbent lotion. It lasts for a long time and smells surprisingly good.</li>
    <li> And the price was right with 15% off subscribe and save.  This is the only product that works for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Degree (any scent) is the best deodorant in the world. I tend to perspire a lot (it&#x27;s a family trait) and someone turned me on to Degree years ago and I have never turned back.</li>
    <li> This is a good value on time delivery no negative issues what so ever as always so far Amazon has met my expectations</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that works for me 18 hours a day. I recommend it to people with strong odor. I don&#x27;t like that some time my clothe has white prints because of the deodorant.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Love the product</li>
    <li> I have used degree for a long time,well since right after it came out on the market.Now I do not use anything else,but I only use the powder because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent,which is good for me since I have allergies and asthma.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most brands, and this one works the best.  It is a little stiff going on, but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
    <li> The deodorant is technically effective in its intended purpose, it smells good and keeps you smelling good, but clumps easily, even when applying the proper amount and not heavily sweating, at least to my experience.</li>
    <li> armpits always smell great!&lt;br /&gt;goes on nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;by far my most favorite deodorant out there!</li>
    <li> I love Degree invisible solid deodorant and order these by them case as we all use them. It&#x27;s a great product and buy!</li>
    <li> I used another deodorant for years. I&#x27;m on a fixed income and I was complaining to a friend about the price of my old standby. She told me to try degree. She was right. It is an excellent deodorant, it does just what deoderant is supposed to do and it is very reasonable in price. I get it through amazon subscribe and buy it comes automatically and at a discounted price. That is a good feature that amazon has.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my child.Allot of these products are not being stocked in local stores.Amazon and it&#x27;s sellers keep it stocked. Good Product and not flashy or a high perfume smell, works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Paramedic in a SUPER BUSY city 911 system.  This provides odor and moisture protection without irritation or flaking.  I tried the less inexpensive brands like Suave and even more expensive brands like Dove and this product is the best.  The others tend to flake and ball up when you sweat, but this doesn&#x27;t on me.  I work 13+ hour shifts and i never have to worry about odor or wetness.  I&#x27;m a normal white female age 37 so if you have an overactive sweat issue I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works.</li>
    <li> I love Degree Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant. I brought some whilst I was on holidays in the US, but it is not sold here in Australia.&lt;br /&gt;But I know where I can get more - THANKS to Amazon, once I use the 18  I brought.</li>
    <li> This product works great, especially under stress.  I give presentations for large groups and I&#x27;ve never seen stress sweat marks under arms, etc.  definitely will buy again</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT WILL RECOMMEND 100%.This was done everything went TIME NORMALLY, THE PERFUME HUNDRED PERCENT RECOMMENDED. VERY GOOD AFTERNOON. BYE</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase, it is a great value for he money and seems to be just like in the local stores. I will likely buy it here again.</li>
    <li> My wife loved the product</li>
    <li> I tried this for my 3 daughters and I because it was the best deal on Amazon through the Subscribe and Save program.  We had never tried Degree before and we really like it.  We will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this Degree, no stains on clothes no caked up feeling under you arms I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great for two days in a row</li>
    <li> This is an ok product but it does leave white marks on your clothes and lately I feel like its really not working. Never had these issues with secret , so I will be switching back.</li>
