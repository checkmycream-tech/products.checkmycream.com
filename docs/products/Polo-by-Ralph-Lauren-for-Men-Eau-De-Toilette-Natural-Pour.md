### Positive Reviews

      <li>Great buy!  </li>
      <li>This is the best price I have seen.</li>

      <li>I have been wearing Polo for many years.</li>
      <li>Polo is Polo gotta love it.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite, not over powering like some.</li>
      <li>I got this for my boyfriend and we both love it.</li>

      <li>Dad enjoyed his favorite scent again.</li>
      <li>so buy it for the person who asked for it, you cheap bastage!</li>
      <li>The spray is always better for him</li>
      <li>so he doesn&#x27;t spill most of it out.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my boyfriend who has used this as his signature scent for many years.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously,I always get compliments with polo green.&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a sure fragrance,this is the ONE.</li>
      <li>This is and always will be my favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>I say polo get me babiethey love it</li>
      <li>Seems to be an authentic product.</li>
      <li>It is really, really strong.</li>
      <li>The cologne itself is fine but the dispenser is defective.</li>
      <li>Thanks! :)</li>
      <li>Cigarettes - Polo wins!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of the original Polo cologne for years and am still.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
      <li>Other than that, it is a great fragrance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t think I would like this one, as I haven&#x27;t been a big fan of Polo anything... but love the cedar undertone!</li>
      <li>Polo Green is great.</li>
      <li>I can remember when i was about 5 or 6 years old play putt putty golf in a famous &amp; barr department store in Fairview heights, Il for a bottle of this Polo by Ralph Lauren.</li>
      <li>I was very eager and excited for him to receive this gift because this was something he wanted for a while now</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it on &amp; off since the 80&#x27;s &amp; have always loved the subtle (wouldn&#x27;t like it if it was strong) tobacco scent.  </li>
      <li>Fast servics!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I bought a bottle that doesn&#x27;t quite smell the way it should.  </li>
      <li>They always compliment me on the scent and say how much they like it!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the real thing.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
      <li>The bottle was only partially filled.</li>
      <li>the price on Amazon is much lower than retail.</li>
      <li>This is not the real scent.</li>
      <li>Now for my cheapness I will have a $105 bottle as it is $60 in the department store where they sell the real stuff.</li>
      <li>I came home from the cologne/perfume shop &amp; gave my old bottle in the medicine cabinet another wiff &amp; sure enough</li>
      <li>I was really excited about getting this, it&#x27;s a scent i remember with fondness from my earlier years</li>
      <li>This is my husbands favorite cologne and the only place to purchase it locally was higher than here.</li>
      <li>It has a cheap purfume smell and is missing the sweet part of the scent that is POLO.</li>
      <li>I had one of these for many years that worked fine, so this is a huge disappointment.</li>
      <li>and i think i\\&quot;d be doing my fragrance purchases direct from the store where i can  smell it first..</li>
      <li>Kind of an middle aged outdoorsies/plad scent.  </li>
      <li>A classic scent that is always pleasing.  </li>
      <li>Brut first if you agree as the fragrance is a bit similar.</li>
      <li>But it is clear that it is a 2oz bottle</li>
      <li>For some reason this turned out to be much weaker that what I buy at the local chain</li>
      <li>But the bottles I&#x27;ve smelled lately smell much more like an ashtray than a cigar.  </li>
      <li>love the smell, and it lastsa long time,a little bit pricey.</li>
      <li>This is not the sellers fault, the seller did exactly what was expected and the Product is what it says it is...</li>
      <li>when my dad opened the box in shock at how strong the smell was... due to the fact that the bottle was damaged and had leaked therefore he received a half bottle of cologne for christmas with no way to return or exchange.</li>
      <li>OK, but not top quality Polo green</li>
      <li>my old Polo has that slight cigar scent, not slight ashtray scent.    </li>

<li> Fast delivery just a small bottle.</li>
<li> Strangers walk up to me and start smelling me (strange)</li>
<li> And the only other  one he needs is halston.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ll let woman do it all day long!</li>
<li> For some reason it is harder to find since the came out with other different fragrances.</li>
<li> I finally found the green Polo for my husband.</li>
<li> It seems that the other colors/scents are easier to find in stores.</li>
<li> Oddly enough and even though he was a very heavy smoker I could always smell Polo on him.  </li>
<li> The push button is at an angle and is not easy to depress to get cologne out of the bottle.</li>
<li> It was not worth the money.</li>
<li> Leery only because of all of the negative reviews.</li>
<li> I almost ordered Drakkar and Eternity while this order of Polo was being shipped, whew could have wasted another $50-$60.</li>
<li> Needless to say I was too young to wear it</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Polo green for over 20 years.  </li>
<li> Not sure if I just got a lemon</li>
<li> Way too expensive when compared to other products.</li>
<li> Just not a good deal.</li>
<li> but the bottle spray applicator is busted and only squirts out a bit of cologne at a time and leaks at the base.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Polo Green is great. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it. It seems that the other colors/scents are easier to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne  fast shipping</li>
    <li> Impressed! Please keep this going.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites!!  Great price also!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I just got a lemon but the bottle spray applicator is busted and only squirts out a bit of cologne at a time and leaks at the base.  They also must have changed the formulation of the cologne from years ago because it&#x27;s not that awesome scent I remember.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my dad as a christmas present. I was very eager and excited for him to receive this gift because this was something he wanted for a while now however I was very disappointed when my dad opened the box in shock at how strong the smell was... due to the fact that the bottle was damaged and had leaked therefore he received a half bottle of cologne for christmas with no way to return or exchange. WORST christmas!! &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> Dad enjoyed his favorite scent again. The spray is always better for him so he doesn&#x27;t spill most of it out.</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised. Still a great fragrance!</li>
    <li> Garanteed to work 60% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Better then sex panther.....&lt;br /&gt;Seriously,I always get compliments with polo green.&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a sure fragrance,this is the ONE.</li>
    <li> The cologne itself is fine but the dispenser is defective. The push button is at an angle and is not easy to depress to get cologne out of the bottle. I had one of these for many years that worked fine, so this is a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about getting this, it&#x27;s a scent i remember with fondness from my earlier years and i was delighted to see that i could still get my hands on it. I got a shock when it arrived though.. it didn&#x27;t smell anything like it i remembered, maybe it&#x27;s just me but it had this weird smell to it like there was something else mixed in. can&#x27;t stand the smell now and i think i\\&quot;d be doing my fragrance purchases direct from the store where i can  smell it first..</li>
    <li> The bottle was only partially filled. It was not worth the money. Just not a good deal. Too bad for people.</li>
    <li> My husband loves Polo and so do I.  the price on Amazon is much lower than retail.</li>
    <li> For some reason this turned out to be much weaker that what I buy at the local chain store.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is gone in about an hour.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Polo green for over 20 years.  This is the first time I bought a bottle that doesn&#x27;t quite smell the way it should.  OK, but not top quality Polo green</li>
    <li> One squirt does the trick all day. It is really, really strong. It&#x27;s not quite the smell that I remember. But, it&#x27;s not terribly off-putting.</li>
    <li> My Grandson is happy with hisPolo!</li>
    <li> You know what it smells like so buy it for the person who asked for it, you cheap bastage! Mmmm</li>
    <li> This cologne smells so good on him I have to keep buying it to have him smell so good! And the only other  one he needs is halston.</li>
    <li> This is not the real scent. Packaging looks identical but the scent is not. It has a cheap purfume smell and is missing the sweet part of the scent that is POLO. What a shame throwing away $45 to save $15. Now for my cheapness I will have a $105 bottle as it is $60 in the department store where they sell the real stuff. Never ever again will I attempt a buy of cologne from Amazon. I almost ordered Drakkar and Eternity while this order of Polo was being shipped, whew could have wasted another $50-$60. I still want my $45 back damn it but you can&#x27;t return anything back to Amazon that is flamable. What a scam from a publicly traded company. I felt I just got scamed on the Wharf.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Polo before and it was a great brand but the one I purchased from Amazon I think it&#x27;s a faked copy. I spray it on and it doesn&#x27;t last until I get to work. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Kind of an middle aged outdoorsies/plad scent.  :D</li>
    <li> Smells good , the girls approach and they like</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and we both love it. I got it for Christmas and he still has a lot left. It doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would like this one, as I haven&#x27;t been a big fan of Polo anything... but love the cedar undertone!</li>
    <li> I swear this scent has changed since it came out decades ago.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it on &amp; off since the 80&#x27;s &amp; have always loved the subtle (wouldn&#x27;t like it if it was strong) tobacco scent.  But the bottles I&#x27;ve smelled lately smell much more like an ashtray than a cigar.  I came home from the cologne/perfume shop &amp; gave my old bottle in the medicine cabinet another wiff &amp; sure enough my old Polo has that slight cigar scent, not slight ashtray scent.    Anyone else get this impression?...</li>
    <li> As advertised. Arrived ahead of schedule. Seems to be an authentic product. Would probably buy again. Leery only because of all of the negative reviews.</li>
    <li> Not the scent that I am looking for, this is my second try, I think that I am used to the type without the spray on it... it may be more concentrated.... This is not the sellers fault, the seller did exactly what was expected and the Product is what it says it is...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an 80&#x27;s baby. I can remember when i was about 5 or 6 years old play putt putty golf in a famous &amp; barr department store in Fairview heights, Il for a bottle of this Polo by Ralph Lauren. Needless to say I was too young to wear it and i believe an uncle of mine took it. If i would have known what i know now I would have kept it for myself. I will be purchasing a bottle soon</li>
    <li> this is a women turn on they come around say u smell  good and what kind is the colone u wearing I say polo get me babiethey love it</li>
    <li> This is and always will be my favorite cologne. My husband loves it also! You just cant go wrong with this for a gift.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best fragrance from Ralph Lauren for me. I&#x27;ve tried all of them but the compliments roll in when ever I&#x27;m wearing this! Strangers walk up to me and start smelling me (strange) but I&#x27;ll let woman do it all day long! lol They always compliment me on the scent and say how much they like it! Always a plus!</li>
    <li> Great gift for my son. I am a hero once again.</li>
    <li> The only cologne I use.  Consider this to be the best.  Been the one for me for over a decade.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Polo is Anytime/Anywhere Cologne. Been using Polo since the 80&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Why change up now, when nothing is broke? Here&#x27;s to another 30+ years.</li>
    <li> Polo is Polo gotta love it. Fast delivery just a small bottle. But it is clear that it is a 2oz bottle so the product is great!</li>
    <li> Got this from Amazon...much cheaper than in our retail store.  This is not a knock off...it&#x27;s the real thing.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive when compared to other products. Other than that, it is a great fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Brut first if you agree as the fragrance is a bit similar.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> Fast servics! As advertised &amp; great price!</li>
    <li> I finally found the green Polo for my husband. For some reason it is harder to find since the came out with other different fragrances.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Polo for many years. This is the best price I have seen. Arrived promptly and packed perfectly to protect it.&lt;br /&gt;A great product and I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite, not over powering like some.</li>
    <li> love the smell, and it lastsa long time,a little bit pricey.</li>
    <li> My husband is in love with this cologne. I should buy it for him by the gallons, if I could!  Great buy!  Thanks! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne because my dad wore the scent for over 25 years.  He passed away this year and I wanted everything I have of his to smell like Polo...to smell like him.  A classic scent that is always pleasing.  Oddly enough and even though he was a very heavy smoker I could always smell Polo on him.  Polo vs. Cigarettes - Polo wins!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend who has used this as his signature scent for many years.  He was thrilled and it smells great.  Arrived on time for Christmas, packed well, in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of the original Polo cologne for years and am still.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product that still gets noticed and complimented on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto y y excelente servicio. Muy rápida la entrega, en tiempo récord. Lo recomiendo. El producto llego en excelente condiciones.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne and the only place to purchase it locally was higher than here. It is great.</li>
