    <li> So I&#x27;m 4&#x27;11 with pretty thick thighs my problem area is usually my thighs and cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;I cut the sheet in the middle so I could use one on the back of my thighs, where I have the most of my visible cellulite and discoloration. There&#x27;s an immediate cooling feeling on your skin which gave me hope that this stuff is actually working. After I left in on for 45-1hr with Saran Wrap. Did a little squats, sweat a little. Took it off and I could see better result of smoother less cellulite skin. I only bought one so I quickly bought 3 more. Yay no I can confidently wear shorts again with being so self-conscious. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Neutriherbs Natural Body wrap applicator does exactly what it claims! It tones and firms in as little as 45 minutes! I was a bit skeptical when I first decided to try this product. Other wraps with the same claims are almost double the cost for a single wrap like this, but I figured I would give it a try anyways. I was very pleasantly surprised! First of all, let me just say that I am not a thin girl with a small little pooch in front. I am what I like to call &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; and have a few dimples here and there from not exercising quite as much as I need to.... My first concern was that I the applicator wouldn&#x27;t fully cover my tummy area, however, that turned out not to be an issue at all. The applicator is generously sized at 22&amp;#34; long and about 11.5&amp;#34; wide in the widest area. Of course, if you are planning on using this on your arms or other smaller areas, you can trim the wrap as needed. This wrap has potent ingredients that help in the reduction of cellulite, stretch marks, improve circulation, just to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;For your first application, it is recommended to only use for 30 minutes, but after the initial use, your next wrap experience is recommended at a minimum of 45 minutes. I personally suggest drinking plenty of water the day before and of the day that you use the wrap. Hydration is great for helping the toxins leave the body. Use of this wrap is super simple! All you do is unfold the wrap carefully, and apply firmly, lotion side first, to the area that you are wanting toned. Once you have it on that area, you can either use a form fitting piece of clothing to hold in place, or you can use plastic wrap, which is what I used and feel would be more effective. Afterwards, just do what you would normally do! Watch TV, wash the dishes, read a book and set a timer for however long you would like to keep the wrap on. Remove the plastic wrap and the wrap itself and rub in the left behind lotion. That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally only kept the wrap on for about 30 minutes and still saw results! I noticed that the little dimples in my tummy area and stretch marks seemed to have faded a bit and that my stomach was smooth and noticeably firmer. It is not recommended to use these wraps more than once every 72hrs. Also, this is not an easy way to skinny! Yes, this product does a great job of toning and detoxing the body, but better results can be seen combined with exercise as well. I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest and unbiased review. Give it a try! You will like it!30 minutes and still saw results!

    <li> The wrap did feel good on my skin but I didn&#x27;t get any results.  I wrapped tightly and even kept it on for longer than specified.  This product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
    <li> I seriously was extremely skeptical about this product but after using it, I am a true believer! As you can see in my photos below, the weight loss is pretty noticeable. I used this wrap after doing rigorous exercises, and I had been drinking weight-loss tea for a couple of days too. I highly recommend this product, because I personally saw such great results. If you don&#x27;t believe it, see for yourself on my photos. I believe I lost 4-5 lbs within a three-day time period, though I do have pretty good metabolism too, so not everyone will see such drastic results as I did. I will definitely re-purchase a couple more of these until I get the results I want. I also feel like it helped my stretchmarks on my belly to be less noticeable and less wide. This product does have a strong smell, and you can start feeling the burn after about 5 minutes of having it on, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. I did receive this product with a promotional code in exchange for an honest review. Thank you seller!</li>

    <li> So I was a little concerned about using this and if it would work, but I did see results, Im very happy about that. This was very simple to use, just put it on and let it go to work. make sure to drink plenty of water to help flush your system. I also put on a waist trimmer belt to help heat it up. you can actually feel it working, I felt a little warmth and tingling. This is great, Im looking forward to seeing the results improve over the next couple of days. I received this item at a reduced rate in exchange for a honest review.</li>
    <li> I just got mine, but the package says you have to use a lotion. What kind of lotion? I wasn&#x27;t informed that you had to use some type of lotion. Do anybody use water?</li>
    <li> This wrap did nothing. I fallowed the directions exactly and nothing. No change at all not even 24,48,or72 hours later. I am very disappointed. I was really hoping it would help with the extra I have left over from having a baby...</li>
    <li> it  burn my skin after the first use!!! So needless to say I did not get a second round of this wrap.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results will be trying a different product .</li>
    <li> I love it and it really does work just like thename brand wraps. II&#x27;m planning on buying more</li>
    <li> Product really does work!</li>
    <li> It really was a waist of money</li>
    <li> I have been pretty small all my life, but college has seemed to take a toll on my body. Now I am noticing a lot of changes and want to try and get back to where I was. When I put on this wrap, I did not notice anything immediately. About 10 minutes later is when I noticed my stomach getting warmer. I left it on for 45 minutes, and washed off the residue in the shower. Before I measured myself, my waist was about 27 inches and after this wrap, was 25 inches. I was extremely skeptical about this product because I know there are many companies that promise extreme results, but this product actually worked, and in a timely matter. After a few days the weight did come back, but that was expected.&lt;br /&gt; I feel this product would be great for those times when your aren&#x27;t feeling the best about yourself when you go out for a night. It offers a quick, temporary solution to make you feel better about yourself. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money 💰 wish I could give no star 🌟 what a waste of money 💰 the best thing to do is drink plenty of water and cut ur carbs and sugar I lost 30lbs buy doing that just thought I could loss inches from my stomach not with this product u wont.</li>
    <li> I got this product at a discount price in return for my unbiased review. I was very on edge about product like these but was eager to try. I applied the wrap to my belly and used surran(sp?) wrap to hold it in place. The smell of the wrap isn&#x27;t pleasant but in minutes you can feel the wrap start working it feels almost like a cold burning sensation. I kept the wrap on for 45 min and when I took it off didn&#x27;t feel a difference but could see a slight difference as the night went on I began feeling the difference! I am looking forward to ordering more to continue this process! They DO work!</li>
    <li> I only used it once and didn&#x27;t really noticed a difference... I&#x27;ll have to try it once more and if the results are the same... I won&#x27;t be buying it again...</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Delivery was on time. It really works! Will buy again &amp; do a review with pictures. I&#x27;m going to tell all my family &amp; friends about it ! :)</li>
    <li> It Didn&#x27;t work bought 5 don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Fake and I regret buying n wasting my precious time</li>
