      <li>I love this product, and I will continue to buy it!</li>
      <li>Great mascara with a curved brush that makes it easy to apply to my lashes.</li>
      <li>I love the waterproof one too - removal is not so easy (advise to use a good make-up remover!</li>
      <li>and my lashes do look nice.</li>
      <li>It honestly DOES give your lashes that &amp;#34;cat-eye&amp;#34; look.</li>
      <li>So far, this mascara is the best!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate and comes off easily!</li>
      <li>Works great and an absolute value for the money!</li>
      <li>My favorite mascara, doesn&#x27;t make lashes clumpy</li>
      <li>i love this mascara  </li>
      <li>For some reason the one I received seemed a bit dryer than I would expect most mascaras to be.</li>
      <li>I love it  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s saying something on my face, because most non-waterproof mascaras explode on my face by day&#x27;s end.</li>
      <li>Iam so glad my husband found this deal.</li>
      <li>The tube is cute and the product is inexpensive ($5 at Wal-Mart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>but if you want more fuller looking lashes, this is not the product for you.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>A top 5 mascara for me.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s is definitely my favorite mascara</li>
      <li>Still, I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a better mascara.</li>
      <li>It works ok.  </li>
      <li>The brush is made to apply more product to the outer corners and lift the lashes</li>
      <li>Love the curved brush.</li>
      <li>If you want a truly great, inexpensive mascara, I would reccommend the original Maybelline Colossal Mascara.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak to what the &amp;#34;cat eyes&amp;#34; is supposed to do or if this is an accurate description, but this mascara is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>Not too over the top, just like you were blessed with long gorgeous lashes!</li>
      <li>I do have somewhat sensitive eyes, but I use the Maybelline &amp;#34;falsies&amp;#34; in the purple tube and LOVE IT!!</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ve just been spoiled by Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous Mascara, which adds volume and length, and can be layered easily without clumping.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply to bottom lashes.  </li>
      <li>Easy application, wears well, easy to remove, would buy again.</li>
      <li>Strong chemical smell</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
      <li>works fine, doesn&#x27;t cause flakes or raccoon eyes.  </li>
      <li>I like this mascara fine.</li>
      <li>it really gives that cat eye effect, and makes the make up much better now!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a great price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Very rarely do I buy mascara and not finish the tube even if I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>but if long eyelashes arent what you are looking for this mascara is great for definition of eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Letting it dry between coats and then reapplying makes it great.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>so is a true washable mascara.</li>
      <li>You will absolutely fall in love with it 100% guaranteed</li>
      <li>It seems like it takes about 3-4 coats to get a look that is good enough.</li>
      <li>My friends noticed the switch and that is good enough for me!</li>
      <li>The applicator allows full separation of eyelashes to create a thicker - longer look.</li>
      <li>Other Maybelline mascaras are great but this one is a dud.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the original Colossal over this cat eyes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Difficult to remove ( it&#x27;s waterproof)&lt;br /&gt;Sticky texture&lt;br /&gt;Dries out quickly ( the tube)&lt;br /&gt;Smudges or runs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>/&gt;Third, this did not give the great volume that I expected from a Colossal product.  </li>
      <li>I reach for this on days I&#x27;m rushing and need a quick, no-fuss coat of mascara, or on days I want a more natural no-makeup look.  </li>
      <li>but, there are better ones available if you want to pay just a little more.</li>
      <li>It is great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s stocking stuffer was a no-brainer, I just bought the same kind she had in her makeup bag, heh heh...</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy over the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>and I liked the regular Colossal mascara.</li>
      <li>All Maybelline Express mascaras are good and really, they all seem to work about the same no matter what they say they will do.</li>
      <li>I used fresh product, so that wasn&#x27;t the problem.</li>
      <li>I really like this, but I still prefer the original Colossal mascara</li>
      <li>but the price is right.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product, in my 50&#x27;s and my eye lashes have thinned this product makes my lashes look like they are full and long!!!!</li>
      <li>I have been using the regular colossal for many years, but  this give the eyelashes a much wider look.</li>
      <li>I will say it lasted pretty well</li>
      <li>the cheaper one actually looked better.</li>
      <li>It definitely makes my lashes darker and longer and it lasts most of the day.</li>
      <li>But everything comes out pretty well when I put it on</li>
      <li>I knew it wouldn&#x27;t look exactly how it looks on the model</li>
      <li>but I was able to fix this by going back through my lashes and using the tip of the brush to seperate them</li>
      <li>(TIP: to make it last longer don&#x27;t pump the wand in and out of the tube to get more product on it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you the extreme lash look, gives more of a natural everyday look, but the curved shape to the brush is great</li>
      <li>but I just get uniform coverage which is pretty decent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a mascara snob. I have spent the big bucks on the &amp;#34;high-end stuff&amp;#34; and I have saved tons of money by switching to this brand for my everyday use. It honestly DOES give your lashes that &amp;#34;cat-eye&amp;#34; look. I love this product, and I will continue to buy it! It does get a bit flakey towards the end of the day, but that is only after hours and hours of wear.</li>
    <li> I will always use this mascara. I have been using the regular colossal for many years, but  this give the eyelashes a much wider look.</li>
    <li> Works great and an absolute value for the money!</li>
    <li> great mascara. Easy to apply, especially for short, thin lashes</li>
    <li> Flakes a lot. Good wand.</li>
    <li> Very rarely do I buy mascara and not finish the tube even if I don&#x27;t like it. I was very dissapointed in this as it made my lashes hard and stuck together. I didn&#x27;t do much for volume or length either.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand of mascara for over a year now. I have extremely short, light eyelashes so mascara is a must for everyday wear. I like the rounded brush which makes it much easier to apply. It definitely makes my lashes darker and longer and it lasts most of the day. A bottle usually lasts a month, maybe two if I get lazy in putting it on. But this is a great mascara for the price.</li>
    <li> Great mascara with a curved brush that makes it easy to apply to my lashes. Really gave me that look of longer lashes and added to my eye appeal.</li>
    <li> Seller was great, but the product was not. It flaked like CRAZY. After putting it on I decided to take it right off because I am a contact wearer and can&#x27;t stand flakes of mascara constantly falling into my eyes. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to anyone, but it is possible it was just an old tube. Still, I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a better mascara.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara, doesn&#x27;t make lashes clumpy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice. For some reason the one I received seemed a bit dryer than I would expect most mascaras to be. But everything comes out pretty well when I put it on and my lashes do look nice. The brush shape makes application easier. I guess my final assessment of this will depend on how long this thing actually lasts me. But considering the discount I got on it, I think it&#x27;s a decent deal.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MASCARA! OMG IT IS AMAZING! It makes my lashes thick, long, ETC. It&#x27;s is definitely my favorite mascara and I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it!❤️ Definitely try it out! You will absolutely fall in love with it 100% guaranteed</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara completely on a whim. It clumps VERY badly, it&#x27;s super thick, and for people with long lashes, it clumps very badly. The brush is basically useless, as it has super short bristles and is an awkward shape.</li>
    <li> Loved trying this mascara. Lasted thru out the day. Does seem to smear though if you are near humid areas. The applicator allows full separation of eyelashes to create a thicker - longer look.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. I&#x27;ve used it a few times before and I keep coming back to it. I&#x27;ll make this simple with a pro/con list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lengthens&lt;br /&gt;Great brush&lt;br /&gt;Applies evenly&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clump&lt;br /&gt;Defines &amp; separates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to remove ( it&#x27;s waterproof)&lt;br /&gt;Sticky texture&lt;br /&gt;Dries out quickly ( the tube)&lt;br /&gt;Smudges or runs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I like the effect so the few cons that it has is worth it.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara yet! I don&#x27;t wear false lashes so this really makes my lashes pop! In that cat eye type of way! I have purchased this mascara several times and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> I had been using another mascara for years until I found this one.  It&#x27;s all I use now.  People have even asked me if I had false eyelashes on!  It makes my lashes long and thick!  Doesn&#x27;t irritate and comes off easily!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, in my 50&#x27;s and my eye lashes have thinned this product makes my lashes look like they are full and long!!!!</li>
    <li> Creates a very simple lash look.  I reach for this on days I&#x27;m rushing and need a quick, no-fuss coat of mascara, or on days I want a more natural no-makeup look.  Doesn&#x27;t beef up my lashes in any significant way, just lightly coats them in black and helps to hold the curl from my eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> WORST mascara ever!! When they say waterproof they mean waterproof!! It wouldn&#x27;t come off even with makeup remover. I had to wait a few days for it to come off. Also application is almost painful! I don&#x27;t recommend this product what so ever to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping to Brazil. Definitely buying again!! Thanks</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t any different than any other mascara. I compared it to some mascara I bought for a dollar and the cheaper one actually looked better.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of a curved applicator, but I don&#x27;t mind this one</li>
    <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used some bad ones lately. I don&#x27;t have problems with irritation often and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but man, this stuff burned my eyes like crazy. I used fresh product, so that wasn&#x27;t the problem. I even tried it a second time, wearing it alone to ascertain that it wasn&#x27;t eye shadow/liner that was causing the irritation. Same thing happened. I had to wash it off and toss it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;Even without the irritation, this stuff is junk. It&#x27;s too thick, goes on clumpy, and causes lashes to stick together and dry in clumps.&lt;br /&gt;This is one to avoid.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite mascara. This is the only one I buy! It&#x27;s such a great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are just perfect! it really gives that cat eye effect, and makes the make up much better now!</li>
    <li> FAKE!!! THIS PRODUCT IS FAKE...I had 2 and it always been my all time fav and i swear to god this one is fake. I will go back to walgreen get it instead of buying it online</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s stocking stuffer was a no-brainer, I just bought the same kind she had in her makeup bag, heh heh...</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much as i&#x27;m not that big of a fan of maybelline mascara but this surprised me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not great but the price is right.  I do like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clump so gets points there</li>
    <li> Favorite mascara! Arrived fast</li>
    <li> Great product, like the brush. Easy application, wears well, easy to remove, would buy again. Letting it dry between coats and then reapplying makes it great.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;ve just been spoiled by Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous Mascara, which adds volume and length, and can be layered easily without clumping.  This is fine, and suprisingly does have somewhat of a cateye effect, but just doesn&#x27;t do half the job that Loreal&#x27;s does for the same price.  I guess there is a reason that Loreal has a cult following....</li>
    <li> Favorite Mascara ever!</li>
    <li> this is my favorite mascara and is half the price than at the store.  Iam so glad my husband found this deal.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom, she loves it.</li>
    <li> I use this with Maybelline One by One and it makes my lashes long &amp; curved!  Not too over the top, just like you were blessed with long gorgeous lashes!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to what the &amp;#34;cat eyes&amp;#34; is supposed to do or if this is an accurate description, but this mascara is fantastic!  My lashes are very blonde, short, and thin.  With this product, I get great length and volume with no clumps or flaking.  I am constantly trying new mascara of all prices and brands searching for something to give me the length and volume I desire without applying coat after coat and this one by far exceeds anything else I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Maybe my tube was older but it started clumping up about 1 week after use.</li>
    <li> This is amazing mascara! I&#x27;m surprised at the amount of negative reviews because this stuff rocks. If you want a more dramatic look, just apply more. To have the cat eye look, I would recommend giving extra attention to the outer corner. When it gets dry/clumpy that means its time for a new tube. (TIP: to make it last longer don&#x27;t pump the wand in and out of the tube to get more product on it. Simply swish in a circular motion. It will last a long longer!)</li>
    <li> It works ok.  Hate the brush.  I prefer the original Colossal over this cat eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I have natural very long/full lashes and the applicator coats each and every lash. Prior to trying the cay eye version, I was using the standard volume express colossal (with the giant wand). My friends noticed the switch and that is good enough for me! No clumps, easy removal, and does not leave me with raccoon eyes after a long day. I love the waterproof one too - removal is not so easy (advise to use a good make-up remover! Regular soap doesn&#x27;t cut it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Happy</li>
    <li> i love this mascara  i use it after using a primer and it really makes my eyelashes pop  it works just as good if not better then expensive mascaras</li>
    <li> I have bought just about every $30 mascara out there, and I always end up back to this mascara. The shape of the brush is the absolute easiest to apply, and it gets the corners of my eyes easily, with no mascara above or below my eye like the big puffy wands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy most of my makeup from the more expensive brands because I really think they are worth the extra money, but I would pay $30 for this mascara before I would pay it for any of the expensive brands ever again.</li>
    <li> I love it. Great mascara! I recommend to those who like thick eyelashes. It is great for everyday use. It washes off great as well.</li>
    <li> works fine, doesn&#x27;t cause flakes or raccoon eyes.  End of the work day my eyes do start to sting till I get home and take it off.  Irritating to contacts if left on too long.</li>
    <li> I like the curved comb for extra coverage</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on amazon, BUT I did just purchase this product and it is terrible. I had some issues with my eyes burning/itching/flaking. I do have somewhat sensitive eyes, but I use the Maybelline &amp;#34;falsies&amp;#34; in the purple tube and LOVE IT!! This brush is so thin and I feel like no product gets on the brush. It seems like it takes about 3-4 coats to get a look that is good enough. I have med length thick (ish) lashes so its not hard to get them to look decent, and I normally am a one- 2 coat girl depending on the occasion. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it  thank you so much ~</li>
    <li> The best mascara ever</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this because I wanted to try a curved brush and I liked the regular Colossal mascara. Big mistake. The brush is awkward and strange, the formula is thin and crunchy/spiky once it&#x27;s on, and it dried too quickly (which wouldn&#x27;t be bad except for the brush, it&#x27;s so awkward I poked my face all the time and then couldn&#x27;t get the black smudges off because it dried!). I will say it lasted pretty well and that&#x27;s saying something on my face, because most non-waterproof mascaras explode on my face by day&#x27;s end. But it was so much extra effort to make this mascara workable that I pitched it after about a month worth of use. Such a waste.  EDIT 1/20/2017: I&#x27;ve also used several other mascaras with curved brushes, and I can confirm that this one, at least for me, was just strange. Still one of the worst mascara experiences I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Makes lashes long and separated.  Easy to apply to bottom lashes.  Doesn&#x27;t clump up.  Need to apply several coats to get it thick.</li>
    <li> So far, this mascara is the best! I&#x27;ve tried several.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara fine. Not as great as Maybelline Falsies mascara but still makes my eyes pop. Will probably stick with falsies but if long eyelashes arent what you are looking for this mascara is great for definition of eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I like when mascara has a curved brush like this one does it make putting it on the end lashes so much easier. The coverage is good and it goes on evenly.</li>
    <li> This mascara gives my eyelashes definition but it doesn&#x27;t make them all clumpy and gross. The texture is thin but goes on easy and dries pretty quick. The claw brush is great for separating my lashes and making them stand out but I didn&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; effect. This is a great lightweight mascara but if you want more fuller looking lashes, this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> Strong chemical smell</li>
    <li> I like this mascara because it is waterproof. It doesn&#x27;t run or smear. The only problem that I had with it is that it tends to clump a bit. For the price, it is a good mascara but, there are better ones available if you want to pay just a little more.</li>
    <li> This is a good mascara lasts all day. But I like mascaras that separate each lash, I recommend it</li>
    <li> I really like this, but I still prefer the original Colossal mascara</li>
    <li> A top 5 mascara for me. It doesn&#x27;t give you the extreme lash look, gives more of a natural everyday look, but the curved shape to the brush is great, it stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t flake at ALL, doesn&#x27;t clump when layered, and when its time to take it off, you can use basic soap or cleanser with water and it wipes right off without having to use makeup remover so is a true washable mascara.</li>
    <li> This mascara gives my lashes volume and length but I don&#x27;t see any cat eye appearance to my lashes. The brush is made to apply more product to the outer corners and lift the lashes but I just get uniform coverage which is pretty decent. All Maybelline Express mascaras are good and really, they all seem to work about the same no matter what they say they will do. I use this mascara as an everyday one and it doesn&#x27;t flake or clump. It is inexpensive too. I use other mascaras for more drama or mix two types when I want mega lashes.</li>
    <li> Love the curved brush. This mascara makes my eyelashes look longer and fuller.</li>
    <li> All i can say is This made my lashes very clumpy. Also doesn&#x27;t give much volume at all. I would recommend a different maybelline mascara.</li>
    <li> It came in very good condictions :)</li>
    <li> I am a makeup junkie, always eager to buy the newest product to hit stores, and this mascara by Maybelline was no exception.  I bought it without reading prior reviews based on the product&#x27;s commercial, the tube design, and past experience with Maybelline mascaras (all of which have been positive).  However, I was very disappointed with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the brush is very thin with short bristles.  It is curved, which I like, but the arch seemed more pronounced than in other curved brushes, probably because of the lenght of the bristles.  In person, the brush looks different than how it is pictured on Amazon and Maybelline&#x27;s website.  The awkward shape of the brush made it slightly more difficult than other brushes to apply this mascara to my lashes; I feel it could get very messy if you aren&#x27;t careful or aren&#x27;t used to this type of brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it did not give the cat eye effect I was halfway hoping for.  I knew it wouldn&#x27;t look exactly how it looks on the model (does this ever happen?) but I thought there would be a flared look, however slight.  Even if I applied extra mascara to the outer corners, my lashes were all the same lenghth and had the same lenghth as when I applied a different type of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, this did not give the great volume that I expected from a Colossal product.  Rather, it made my lashes thin and kind of spindly looking.  It clumped slightly but I was able to fix this by going back through my lashes and using the tip of the brush to seperate them (this was a hassle!).  The formula was also very wet and took longer than other mascaras to dry, and I feel that this impacted the clumping.  In the end, this product gave me a look that was not as dramatic as I like but slightly more than an \\&quot;every day\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a couple of good things about this product but they do not outweigh the cons.  It gives pretty decent lenght, the color is dark, I don&#x27;t notice any flaking, and it removes easilyat night.  The tube is cute and the product is inexpensive ($5 at Wal-Mart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do not reccommend this product.  Other Maybelline mascaras are great but this one is a dud.  If you want a truly great, inexpensive mascara, I would reccommend the original Maybelline Colossal Mascara.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time but I&#x27;m not crazy over the quality of the product. I did get what I paid for</li>
    <li> Does not go on thick at all, and crumbles off, other Maybeline liners work much better.</li>
