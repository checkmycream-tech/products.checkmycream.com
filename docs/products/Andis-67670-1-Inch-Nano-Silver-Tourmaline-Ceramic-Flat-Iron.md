      <li>My hair got straight after 1 pass, and it did not appear to cause more split ends.  </li>

      <li>* Heats quickly  </li>
      <li>This flat iron leaves my hair smooth &amp; nice</li>
      <li>It heats to really hot and did a nice job, but suddenly didn&#x27;t heat as well anymore</li>
      <li>I got a new haircut and my bangs looked better straight, so I purchased this iron.</li>

      <li>Various heat settings to suit many types of hair  </li>
      <li>It gets hot within 30 seconds and does not damage my hair at all.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is an Ok product for the price.</li>
      <li>This flat iron is working well so far, very easy to handle with the finger pads and gets my hair smooth straight with 1 to 2 runs.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THESE FLAT IRONS.</li>
      <li>Overall, a fine product at an affordable price that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I almost splurged on a pricier different brand because it seemed to be rated a little better, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>It was inexpensive works very well.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for a straightener again if I didnt have to.</li>
      <li>Actually, my bangs are now almost straight on their own now, so if you wanted to have curly hair one day and straight the next, this might not be your iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was very affordable and works just as well as my paul mitchell straightener.</li>
      <li>My only issue with the straightener is that it looks slightly cheap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ready FAST.</li>
      <li>Given the reviews I expected more though.</li>
      <li>Its obviously no Chi straightener (I mean, the price is pretty great), but</li>
      <li>THESE FLAT IRONS GET REALLY REALLY HOOTTTT!!!</li>
      <li>It really straightens my hair and leaves it noticeably smoother than my old iron which I&#x27;m certain was just frying my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is not thick or really curly and when it is fully dry it still takes me 10-15 minutes to get it really smooth.</li>
      <li>It performs wayyyyyy better than the cheap irons I have had in the past not even in the same league.  </li>
      <li>IF YOU HAVE VERY KINKY AND CURLY HAIR, THIS PRODUCT WILL DEFINITELY GET YOUR HAIR VERY STRAIGHT.</li>
      <li>She used it a few times too and said that she likes it WAY better than her mom&#x27;s Chi - it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m returning this one for a refund instead of having them send me a new one.</li>
      <li>My hair was very soft and shiny after use.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 years the coating is coming off the plates</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this after my Hot Tools straigthening iron stopped performing as well as it used to.</li>
      <li>As a licensed skin care therapist, I have access to professional products at a discount.  </li>
      <li>The only other flat iron I&#x27;ve owned is a super cheap $10 flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Cons: You cant Squeeze too tight dosent glide as smooth as i like,     Overall</li>
      <li>I was ready to invest in an expensive straightening iron similar to what stylists use at salons, but after comparing prices and reading reviews for numerous products, I opted for the more affordable Andis.    </li>
      <li>I purchased this flat iron as a replacement for an older Andis flat iron that I&#x27;ve had for years.  </li>
      <li>Hard to clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t take too long to heat up and has multiple heat settings, but all the settings are rather high.</li>

<li> My only concern is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be built in a way that will last for a long time...</li>
<li> But with proper maintenance, I don&#x27;t see why this flat iron shouldn&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
<li> Steam, Smoothe finish, Preety color, Wet to dry, made my hair soo soft    </li>
<li> I was hoping to skip the blow drying, but there&#x27;s a big warning in the instructions to NOT use it on wet hair.</li>
<li> I had been using a ceramic tools flat iron that was 2 or 3 inches wide.  </li>

<li> My other flat iron had an auto shut off</li>
<li> It&#x27;s narrow enough to use to curl and wide enough to straighten.  </li>
<li> You can have a couple on hand &amp;  still spend less if they last a year or longer.  </li>
<li> WHen I bought this, the amazon description claimed it worked on wet or dry hair, but it does NOT work on wet hair!</li>
<li> but, my expensive one burnt out in under a year so, considering that it is well worth the money.  </li>
<li> I have thick hair but usually don&#x27;t crank it up above 5</li>
<li> The product does what it needs to do but it takes a little longer that the nicer (chi) brands.</li>
<li> So I did a little research on the internet</li>
<li> When I took it out of the box it already had a few scratches on it and the color looks faded.&lt;br</li>
<li> so it pulls a few hairs out, not painful but annoying.</li>
<li> very comparably so to the very expensive iron it is replacing.  </li>
<li> My only problem is that it randomly stops generating heat</li>
<li> I have very thick hair and this straightener works just as well as my other straightener.</li>
<li> I was kind of disappointed but for the price, how disappointed can you be?</li>
<li> Only one word needed... CRAP</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really enjoyed mine for the 6 months I had it. It heats to really hot and did a nice job, but suddenly didn&#x27;t heat as well anymore and then didn&#x27;t want to work. I tossed it after using it maybe 3x a week for 6 months. I was kind of disappointed but for the price, how disappointed can you be?</li>
    <li> very nice product, work pretty  good with thick hair. I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and leave my hair shine after used.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron as a replacement for an older Andis flat iron that I&#x27;ve had for years.  I am definitely impressed with it so far.  It really straightens my hair and leaves it noticeably smoother than my old iron which I&#x27;m certain was just frying my hair.  I have thick hair but usually don&#x27;t crank it up above 5 and it works great and last for days.  Like another reviewer mine has occasionally stopped generating heat but I just click it off for a second and then back on and we&#x27;re good to go.  My other flat iron had an auto shut off so maybe that&#x27;s what it is?  Overall I would recommend it.  It&#x27;s a great alternative to spending upwards of $100 for some of the other brands.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is working well so far, very easy to handle with the finger pads and gets my hair smooth straight with 1 to 2 runs. My only problem is that it randomly stops generating heat and I have to switch it off and on to &#x27;reset&#x27; it. So its great... when it works and is definitely  better than paying up to and over a hundred $$$ for.</li>
    <li> I just got this straightener today and I&#x27;m actually quite happy with it. Its obviously no Chi straightener (I mean, the price is pretty great), but it gets the job done, and my hair just as good as when I use a Chi. Its also perfect for curling your hair if you need to since the sides of the plates are slightly curved in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t take too long to heat up and has multiple heat settings, but all the settings are rather high. My only issue with the straightener is that it looks slightly cheap. When I took it out of the box it already had a few scratches on it and the color looks faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price: 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve had this  straightener for years and it still works! The best buy for this price</li>
    <li> THESE FLAT IRONS GET REALLY REALLY HOOTTTT!!! IF YOU HAVE VERY KINKY AND CURLY HAIR, THIS PRODUCT WILL DEFINITELY GET YOUR HAIR VERY STRAIGHT. I LOVE THESE FLAT IRONS. THE MATERIAL IS GREAT, FIRM, AND VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER. IF YOU WANT STRAIGHT HAIR, BUY THESE!!!</li>
    <li> Nice design and great to use!</li>
    <li> Only one word needed... CRAP</li>
    <li> Pros: Steam, Smoothe finish, Preety color, Wet to dry, made my hair soo soft    Cons: You cant Squeeze too tight dosent glide as smooth as i like,     Overall I like it alot and I will be repurchasing    [...]</li>
    <li> I recently bought this straightener because my paul mitchell gave up on me. I loved my paul mitchell but I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for a straightener again if I didnt have to. After reading a lot of reviews and recommendations I went with this one. Ive had this straightener for almost a month and I love it! It was very affordable and works just as well as my paul mitchell straightener. I have very thick hair and this straightener works just as well as my other straightener. It gets hot within 30 seconds and does not damage my hair at all. If you are looking for a reasonably priced straightener for a great price this is a great way to go!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this after my Hot Tools straigthening iron stopped performing as well as it used to. I had owned that one for nearly ten years, though, so it served me well. I was ready to invest in an expensive straightening iron similar to what stylists use at salons, but after comparing prices and reading reviews for numerous products, I opted for the more affordable Andis.    I have thick, wavy hair and was unsure if a less expensive iron like this one would do a good job of taming my waves. All my doubts were put to rest after using the iron. I originally set it at a medium heat setting, which straightened my hair perfectly. But ever since, I&#x27;ve been using a low setting which surprisingly still works on my unruly hair.    Pros:  * Heats quickly  * Various heat settings to suit many types of hair  * Power switch is strategically placed to avoid accidental turn-off  * Has locking mechanism so you can secure the plates for travel    Cons:  * The silver finish looks kind of cheap    Overall, a fine product at an affordable price that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. As another reviewer noted, the product doesn&#x27;t have the appearance of being made well (which is solely why I give it four stars instead of five). But with proper maintenance, I don&#x27;t see why this flat iron shouldn&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
    <li> I got this and it didn&#x27;t even turn on-- I had to return it.  I ordered a different product (curling iron) by the same company, and it made my hair really coarse and smelled like burning plastic.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m returning this one for a refund instead of having them send me a new one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron in hopes for a great product. But of course I ended up with a lemon. Sometimes it works and most times it doesnt. If I were you Id chose another iron.</li>
    <li> It was inexpensive works very well. Gave it as a gift person liked the color and says that it works just a well as the pricey ones.  So all and all it was great purchase.</li>
    <li> I had been using a ceramic tools flat iron that was 2 or 3 inches wide.  When I cut my hair shorter it became difficult to manuver - although still worked well.  As a licensed skin care therapist, I have access to professional products at a discount.  So I ran out and bought a 1 inch biosilk straightener - that was supposedly the same as the chi (same manufacturer and basic model).  I never plugged it in because the plates didn&#x27;t line up and it pulled my hair when I ran it through.  So I did a little research on the internet and it looked like this was the best option.  I used it once and was very very pleased.  Great manuverability and straightening ability at a medium heat setting.  My neice was recovering from a toncilectomy last week and stayed at my house.  She used it a few times too and said that she likes it WAY better than her mom&#x27;s Chi - it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after fairly extensive research.  Everyone said that the Nano-Silver products were the ones to get and this one had pretty good reviews and was affordable.  I almost splurged on a pricier different brand because it seemed to be rated a little better, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  She has loved this one.  It has held up to all her use and is still going strong.  It&#x27;s narrow enough to use to curl and wide enough to straighten.  Based on the results I can see I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron leaves my hair smooth &amp; nice very comparably so to the very expensive iron it is replacing.  It performs wayyyyyy better than the cheap irons I have had in the past not even in the same league.  My only concern is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be built in a way that will last for a long time...but, my expensive one burnt out in under a year so, considering that it is well worth the money.  You can have a couple on hand &amp;  still spend less if they last a year or longer.  I say give it a try.</li>
    <li> I was happy with  the product. Given the reviews I expected more though. The product does what it needs to do but it takes a little longer that the nicer (chi) brands. My hair is not thick or really curly and when it is fully dry it still takes me 10-15 minutes to get it really smooth. The design is OK, light which is good since you have to hold it for awhile. Your hair does get stuck between the plates so it pulls a few hairs out, not painful but annoying. It gets hot fast which is great. Overall, it is an Ok product for the price.</li>
    <li> The only other flat iron I&#x27;ve owned is a super cheap $10 flat iron.  This was a big improvement.  I have very fine, and straight hair.  My hair got straight after 1 pass, and it did not appear to cause more split ends.  My hair was very soft and shiny after use.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 years the coating is coming off the plates and I&#x27;m replacing it with something more expensive.</li>
    <li> It fell apart. Hard to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my curly, frizzy, out of control hair for about 2 months. I got a new haircut and my bangs looked better straight, so I purchased this iron. I use it every day and my hair is not damaged at all. It glides across my hair and straightens in only one swipe. My straightened hair looks smooth and silky. Actually, my bangs are now almost straight on their own now, so if you wanted to have curly hair one day and straight the next, this might not be your iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other great features:&lt;br /&gt;+ Auto turn off - I&#x27;ve left it on a couple of times, came home from work and it had turned itself off! Nice.&lt;br /&gt;+ Locking mechanism, great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;+ 20 heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;+ It&#x27;s ready FAST. WHich is great because I don&#x27;t have a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;+ Doesn&#x27;t stick on or pull hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit worried about buying this because I saw complaints about the plates peeling. I haven&#x27;t had any issues. After 2 months of daily use, mine looks as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Note: WHen I bought this, the amazon description claimed it worked on wet or dry hair, but it does NOT work on wet hair! I was hoping to skip the blow drying, but there&#x27;s a big warning in the instructions to NOT use it on wet hair. Even so, I have to give it 5 stars because performs so well on dry hair.</li>
