      <li>I love these brush guards.</li>

      <li>Always use clean brushes on your face!  </li>
      <li>Easy to put on and remove.</li>
      <li>Does its job just fine.</li>
      <li>I love this so much I had to get for all my brushes!!</li>
      <li>i used to roll my brushes up in a towel and secure with a rubber band, but with the brush guard, i can pack them in a pencil pouch with no worries.</li>
      <li>They won&#x27;t fit on my brushes that are 1\\&quot; around.</li>
      <li>I should have saved myself that dollar something and just bought these right from the start!</li>
      <li>i love these so much</li>
      <li>I can throw these on a brush and throw them in my purse without worrying about the bristles getting messed up or full of dirt and crud.</li>
      <li>they do stretch so it would fit the right size brush.</li>
      <li>However, once you use them the first time they are easy to slide on.</li>
      <li>My brushes finish drying in perfect form and are as good as new when I remove the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because there is nothing to stop the guard from sliding backwards on the brush (and splaying the bristles in the wrong direction),&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>this brush guards are perfect for my expensive brushes that I was to make sure to keep its shape.  </li>
      <li>I brought the multi-pack of these first and loved how it reshaped my brushes and brought them back to their original condition.  </li>
      <li>These brush guards keep the bristles together and regain that original shape and does exactly what I want it to do.  </li>
      <li>Price is super reasonable!  </li>
      <li>I have actually ordered several of these and every time I buy more brushes, I buy more of these.</li>
      <li>Comes with 10 which is more than enough for me!</li>
      <li>I find it works better for smaller brushes like eye shadows brushes.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am glad I tried it, I will keep using mine</li>
      <li>I have purchased these several times as I have (too many) make-up brushes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a landscape painter in oils and have many fine sable brushes and these are amazing to keep my just washed brushes from drying crazy, plus to protect them while laying in the drawers or if I&#x27;m traveling.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without these now- worth every penny to save me from having to re-clean a brush that has been sitting for awhile.</li>
      <li>Love these for cleaning my make up brushes they dry nice and tight again.</li>
      <li>They will fit the smallest brushes only, for example an eyeliner brush.</li>
      <li>I am so happy to know that my investment in my brushes will last longer for such a low price.</li>
      <li>Now I just lay my brushes on a folded towel on the kitchen table and it does the job much faster.  </li>
      <li>They really will extend the life of your brushes.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be put off by how small the diameter is, they stretch amazingly well around the handle.  </li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
      <li>but it does stretch considerably and is very protective.  </li>
      <li>I am a clean freak when it comes to my makeup brushes and this makes it way easier to store and dry all my brushes.</li>
      <li>mainly because i feel that the brushes should dry without any obstruction to make sure they dry fully and not get moldy if it didn&#x27;t, which could be very harmful.</li>
      <li>Some of the more widely used brushes were starting to loose its original shape.  </li>
      <li>i think i will buy the larger brush guards for my large face brushes, my kabuki, and my lowe- cornell mopines.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to slide these off and have the shape brought back to my expensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recommend sliding off the guard from your larger brushes the morning after washing to allow the center to dry more easily once the exterior bristles have mostly dried.</li>
      <li>I had a few where I thought they wouldn&#x27;t fit because the brush handle was really fat, but every single time they stretched right over.</li>
      <li>I wash many of my brushes almost every time I use them, and always have to leave them out to dry, where wreckless boys can mess them up</li>
      <li>because the pencil holder is mesh, the brushes dry much faster than in a glass.  </li>
      <li>I like it as it is useful to ensure the brushes aren&#x27;t messy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, I just probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s something that I need.  </li>
      <li>If you only use a few regularly then you may feel it&#x27;s worth the hassle.</li>

<li> If you only use a few regularly then you may feel it&#x27;s worth the hassle.</li>
<li> these are very sturdy and allow me to dry the brushes upside down in a mesh pencil cup bought at the dollar store.</li>
<li> These are extremely small, only about 1/8 inch wide, and most of my eyeshadow brushes will not fit, which is why I bought them.  </li>
<li> when i first got them I was skeptical because they looked so tiny, but they stretch really well and still keeps its integrity.</li>
<li> THese work really well, do the job and store small for when not in use.</li>
<li> You can even stand the brushes up to dry in a cup on the end of the brush guard with the handle up and the bristles facing down if you make sure the brush guard extends past the end of the bristles a little.</li>
<li> Then simply let dry.  </li>
<li> some instances, larger brushes will have some difficulty drying completely in the same amount of time that your small brushes will dry.</li>
<li> These allow you to reshape and dry brushes downward instead of flat on side so that you preserve the glue holding the bristles.  </li>
<li> Some of the slimmer ones are really long</li>
<li> , especially if you have wide or fat handled brushes.  </li>
<li> They serve the same function--they keep the shape of your brushes while protecting them from any other makeup residue that the bristles might come in contact with.  </li>
<li> They can be stiff and hard to open when you first take them out of the pack.</li>
<li> I like how they stretch just enough to provide a firm capsule around the brushes.</li>
<li> so I cut them down in half and end up with extra.</li>
<li> The brush guards keep your brushes shaped while drying, you can also dry your brushes upside down, as the guards protect the brush.</li>
<li> , so i use them to dry my brushes after i wash them, putting them upside down.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using them for almost a year, and the ends are slightly widening, but that&#x27;s not a problem, and really I&#x27;d have thought it would have been worse.</li>
<li> My brushes don&#x27;t get damaged with other products in my make up bag.  </li>
<li> The center will usually be a little damp even after 8 hours.</li>
<li> Keep in mind that this will be less of a problem if you&#x27;re using the correct size guard vs trying to put a brush into a guard that fits but is slightly too</li>
<li> To use them, just wash your brushes out, shape them a little by hand, and slip the brush guard up the handle and over the bristles.  </li>
<li> Try these if you have brushes you want to protect or you just don&#x27;t want to deal with messy brushes.</li>
<li> I would use this on is a fluffy eye brush</li>
<li> Less shedding!  </li>
<li> I was worried these might be too small for all my eyeshadow brushes</li>
<li> I usually rotate my powder and foundation brushes out and don&#x27;t have the issue of having damp brush, but it&#x27;s something to keep in mind.</li>
<li> This pack is for very small eye brushes.</li>
<li> I finally gave in and purchased these costal scent protectors after I bought some generic dollar something ones that were terrible.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I do wish they came with a durable plastic pouch for storage, vs the thin, easy-to-tear plastic sleeve that they come in.</li>
<li> another reviewer mentioned, these are fo shadow or liner brushes with a very thin handle.  </li>
<li> Not too badly</li>

    <li> this brush guards are perfect for my expensive brushes that I was to make sure to keep its shape.  Some of the more widely used brushes were starting to loose its original shape.  Not too badly but it was getting wider since bristles were spreading out more.  These brush guards keep the bristles together and regain that original shape and does exactly what I want it to do.  I know these are reccommended for drying with also but I personally don&#x27;t use it for that.  mainly because i feel that the brushes should dry without any obstruction to make sure they dry fully and not get moldy if it didn&#x27;t, which could be very harmful.</li>
    <li> great for my brushes, they do the job and my brushes look like new when I washed them and keep them in this</li>
    <li> I have seen a lot of beauty reviews about the brush guard. I use it solely for after my brushes are washed to keep their shape. I find it works better for smaller brushes like eye shadows brushes. I like it as it is useful to ensure the brushes aren&#x27;t messy. Overall, I am glad I tried it, I will keep using mine but I don&#x27;t love it. I would recommend another product - benjabelle brush tree more for cleaning purposes</li>
    <li> Perfect for reshaping your brushes after washing.</li>
    <li> Great product but i can use it, for the purpose that its suppose to be use, because this things moves with the time and the bristles fold to the backside of the brush and then you can your brush with some bristles downsized, awful, so i use them to dry my brushes after i wash them, putting them upside down.</li>
    <li> Any girl who has a stash of makeup brushes needs these. They ensure that your brushes maintain their shape always.</li>
    <li> Love these for cleaning my make up brushes they dry nice and tight again. Wish it came in larger combo packs though.</li>
    <li> Does its job just fine. Some of the slimmer ones are really long so I cut them down in half and end up with extra.</li>
    <li> good to protect your makeup brushes. the only downside is that sometimes the hairs would stick out  through the holes of the brush guard. so when you protect your brushes, make sure to check for hair the would stick out. they do stretch so it would fit the right size brush.</li>
    <li> THese work really well, do the job and store small for when not in use. I would repurchase these in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a landscape painter in oils and have many fine sable brushes and these are amazing to keep my just washed brushes from drying crazy, plus to protect them while laying in the drawers or if I&#x27;m traveling.  I also use these on my regular cosmetic brushes and its a must have since I wash these weekly.  Plus if you travel you slip this baby around your brush heads and they are protected from whatever.  Don&#x27;t be put off by how small the diameter is, they stretch amazingly well around the handle.  I have also bought the blush guard size and the multi-pac sizes and will always use these.</li>
    <li> Product works wonders with my brushes! I use it for my eye shadow brushes and foundation brush&lt;br /&gt;And my smudge brush they are fabulous and a perfect way to keep brushes clean</li>
    <li> these brush guards are perfect.  while i was using thread socks for my larger brushes, i had nothing for my smaller brushes.  these are very sturdy and allow me to dry the brushes upside down in a mesh pencil cup bought at the dollar store. because the pencil holder is mesh, the brushes dry much faster than in a glass.  i love these so much i think i will buy the larger brush guards for my large face brushes, my kabuki, and my lowe- cornell mopines.  they are also great for travel too.  i used to roll my brushes up in a towel and secure with a rubber band, but with the brush guard, i can pack them in a pencil pouch with no worries.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these several times as I have (too many) make-up brushes. I absolutely love these- perfect for making sure the brushes retain their shape, protects them from dust while they are being stored, and fit to stretch over every size brush. I had a few where I thought they wouldn&#x27;t fit because the brush handle was really fat, but every single time they stretched right over. I can&#x27;t live without these now- worth every penny to save me from having to re-clean a brush that has been sitting for awhile. ***HIGHLY RECOMMEND***</li>
    <li> I got one of these as a sample and was immediately hooked, so I bought them in every size to take care of all my makeup brushes.  To use them, just wash your brushes out, shape them a little by hand, and slip the brush guard up the handle and over the bristles.  Then simply let dry.  When done your brush bristles will be properly aligned and compact, not sticking out in every direction.  You can even stand the brushes up to dry in a cup on the end of the brush guard with the handle up and the bristles facing down if you make sure the brush guard extends past the end of the bristles a little.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, I just probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s something that I need.  I have only used them a couple of times.  Now I just lay my brushes on a folded towel on the kitchen table and it does the job much faster.  If you have a lot of brushes, using these could become a pain.  If you only use a few regularly then you may feel it&#x27;s worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The brush guards keep your brushes shaped while drying, you can also dry your brushes upside down, as the guards protect the brush.</li>
    <li> The keep my brushes well shaped. They make traveling with my brushes very easy. I like how they stretch just enough to provide a firm capsule around the brushes. I have actually ordered several of these and every time I buy more brushes, I buy more of these.</li>
    <li> I had picked up a pack of the [[ASIN:B007QYWU24 SEPHORA COLLECTION Brush Protectors Set]] but ran out of the smallest protectors, so I found these on Amazon. They serve the same function--they keep the shape of your brushes while protecting them from any other makeup residue that the bristles might come in contact with.  I like these ones better though--they seem a tad lower profile, and I like that they&#x27;re transparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentioned, these are fo shadow or liner brushes with a very thin handle.  My brushes that it fits are 3/4\\&quot; around (in circumference) at the widest point.  They won&#x27;t fit on my brushes that are 1\\&quot; around.</li>
    <li> The brush guard is a great tools for drying your makeup brushes as well as for protecting your brushes while traveling.</li>
    <li> when i first got them I was skeptical because they looked so tiny, but they stretch really well and still keeps its integrity. Largest brush I would use this on is a fluffy eye brush</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect fit for my brushes and the plastic is very stable. I am a clean freak when it comes to my makeup brushes and this makes it way easier to store and dry all my brushes.</li>
    <li> I was worried these might be too small for all my eyeshadow brushes but it does stretch considerably and is very protective.  I finally gave in and purchased these costal scent protectors after I bought some generic dollar something ones that were terrible.  I should have saved myself that dollar something and just bought these right from the start!</li>
    <li> These are awesome. My brushes finish drying in perfect form and are as good as new when I remove the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because there is nothing to stop the guard from sliding backwards on the brush (and splaying the bristles in the wrong direction),&lt;br /&gt;I personally wouldnt recommend these for travel. For home use, they&#x27;re wonderful and I&#x27;m happy to slide these off and have the shape brought back to my expensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some instances, larger brushes will have some difficulty drying completely in the same amount of time that your small brushes will dry. The center will usually be a little damp even after 8 hours. I usually rotate my powder and foundation brushes out and don&#x27;t have the issue of having damp brush, but it&#x27;s something to keep in mind. I recommend sliding off the guard from your larger brushes the morning after washing to allow the center to dry more easily once the exterior bristles have mostly dried. Keep in mind that this will be less of a problem if you&#x27;re using the correct size guard vs trying to put a brush into a guard that fits but is slightly too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they came with a durable plastic pouch for storage, vs the thin, easy-to-tear plastic sleeve that they come in.</li>
    <li> These are extremely small, only about 1/8 inch wide, and most of my eyeshadow brushes will not fit, which is why I bought them.  They will fit the smallest brushes only, for example an eyeliner brush.</li>
    <li> These are great brush guards. Easy to put on and remove. Try these if you have brushes you want to protect or you just don&#x27;t want to deal with messy brushes.</li>
    <li> I brought the multi-pack of these first and loved how it reshaped my brushes and brought them back to their original condition.  They were starting to splay and lose their shape.  If you invest in your brushes you must pick these up.  They really will extend the life of your brushes. This pack is for very small eye brushes. They can be stiff and hard to open when you first take them out of the pack., especially if you have wide or fat handled brushes.  However, once you use them the first time they are easy to slide on.</li>
    <li> I wash my eye-shadow brushes often and didn&#x27;t know how I went without these!  These allow you to reshape and dry brushes downward instead of flat on side so that you preserve the glue holding the bristles.  This is a brush saver!  Less shedding!  Always use clean brushes on your face!  I love this for travel as well.  My brushes don&#x27;t get damaged with other products in my make up bag.  You will not regret this purchase!  Price is super reasonable!  Comes with 10 which is more than enough for me!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Great for drying your brushes without damaging them.  I love this so much I had to get for all my brushes!!</li>
    <li> these are an invention along the lines of sliced bread - why did nobody think of these sooner? I wash many of my brushes almost every time I use them, and always have to leave them out to dry, where wreckless boys can mess them up so they could get a cowlick - this totally solves that. Also, I can wash brushes and not worry about leaving them out when I&#x27;m travelling. I&#x27;ve been using them for almost a year, and the ends are slightly widening, but that&#x27;s not a problem, and really I&#x27;d have thought it would have been worse. Just brilliant!</li>
    <li> I love these brush guards. I am so happy to know that my investment in my brushes will last longer for such a low price. These guards keep my brushes just like when I bought them. Great quality.</li>
    <li> These are the tiiiiny this brush guards. I use them on brushes that are the thickness of a qtip through the thickness of a hexagonal pencil. Anything bigger gets the blush guards. I can throw these on a brush and throw them in my purse without worrying about the bristles getting messed up or full of dirt and crud. I don&#x27;t necessarily recommend doing this, but the point is that these things make it so I can.</li>
