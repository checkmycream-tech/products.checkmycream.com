      <li>I just love this fragrance and when I wear it  everyone ask a what it  is</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, and I&#x27;ve had two people tell me that it was amazingly sexy.</li>
      <li>However it still smells just as lovely as the day I bought it.</li>
      <li>We bought this scent for soap-making and it is becoming a favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s warm and sensual and fresh, not overly musky.</li>
      <li>It is too strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance, I just wish there was more of a gingery note to it.</li>
      <li>Love it, it&#x27;s a clean, fresh floral scent  </li>
      <li>Wish the fragrance would last longer, it is so nice!  </li>
      <li>Smells just like the real thing and going to order more.</li>
      <li>These are true scent of the islands.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting this fragrance to have more of a ginger scent, since it&#x27;s called White Ginger, but it&#x27;s actually more of a light musk scent.</li>
      <li>When I was younger, there was a wonderful white ginger perfume that is no longer made, so I was delighted to find that this one is just the same.</li>
      <li>It has such a refreshing scent; I love it.  </li>
      <li>That said, this is the next best thing to the real white ginger smell, which I have in my garden.  </li>
      <li>I keep looking for the same wonderful light white ginger perfume in the pretty bottle that I bought in Kuauii.  </li>
      <li>This is worth every penny and possibly even more.</li>
      <li>I was very hesitant to buy this as I am very picky about scents, and didn&#x27;t want a cheap floral smell.  </li>
      <li>I love the white ginger scent!</li>
      <li>I first bought this in a boutique on Maui.</li>
      <li>I really love the white ginger smell.  </li>
      <li>From the Hawaiian flower, White Ginger, it is exotic and intoxicating.</li>
      <li>Again, beautiful scent and different from other summery scents.</li>
      <li>It quickly changed color after about a month or so from clear to now the color of apple juice.</li>
      <li>It makes the whole room smell heavenly and me too.</li>
      <li>Haha.</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t want people to know that</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t smell any ginger in it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t pick up as much of a &amp;#34;spice&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I have tried lots of other perfumes touting island scents and none have ever measured up to Terra Nova&#x27;s quality and fantastic smell.</li>
      <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not strong, just beautifully distinctive, spicy, fainty floral, not like the usual &amp;#34;who rolled in the florist&#x27;s dumpster&amp;#34; flower fragrances.</li>
      <li>Please create a better cap so that it doesn&#x27;t leak after you open it even if it closed tight.</li>
      <li>I live on Maui, but didn&#x27;t want to make the trek to &amp;#34;the other side&amp;#34; (of the island).</li>

    <li> I was very hesitant to buy this as I am very picky about scents, and didn&#x27;t want a cheap floral smell.  That said, this is the next best thing to the real white ginger smell, which I have in my garden.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, and I&#x27;ve had two people tell me that it was amazingly sexy.</li>
    <li> We bought this scent for soap-making and it is becoming a favorite. A beautiful, aromatic flowery scent that is clean and delightful without being heavy or over-powering. From the Hawaiian flower, White Ginger, it is exotic and intoxicating.</li>
    <li> Glorious white ginger fragrance--reminded me of my childhood where white ginger grew in my backyard! This is worth every penny and possibly even more.</li>
    <li> this is lovely, when you smell it you think you are in a flower shop,or wearing a beautiful lei</li>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s a clean, fresh floral scent  My boss says it smells like hawaii:)&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t mind that at all:)</li>
    <li> I was expecting this fragrance to have more of a ginger scent, since it&#x27;s called White Ginger, but it&#x27;s actually more of a light musk scent. I really don&#x27;t smell any ginger in it. It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance, I just wish there was more of a gingery note to it.</li>
    <li> Like it! Bottle too small pls make it bigger.</li>
    <li> Very good service. Order was shipped and recieved on time.</li>
    <li> Love this beautifully scented oil</li>
    <li> I found the scent a little too heavy to wear so I use it in the bath.  Now I can&#x27;t live without it. It makes the whole room smell heavenly and me too.</li>
    <li> I first bought this in a boutique on Maui. I live on Maui, but didn&#x27;t want to make the trek to &amp;#34;the other side&amp;#34; (of the island). This is the same product at the same price (minus gas money). I love the white ginger scent!</li>
    <li> I just love this fragrance and when I wear it  everyone ask a what it  is</li>
    <li> I have had this perfume for over a year now.  It quickly changed color after about a month or so from clear to now the color of apple juice. However it still smells just as lovely as the day I bought it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is basically like catnip for my husband. He just adores it on me. I like it too. It&#x27;s strong but not overpowering. I like that it&#x27;s in oil form. It&#x27;s warm and sensual and fresh, not overly musky. I don&#x27;t pick up as much of a &amp;#34;spice&amp;#34; note as some reviewers have mentioned. To me the aroma is quite similar to jasmin. Very good price and quality. Curious about Terranova&#x27;s other scents.</li>
    <li> Again, beautiful scent and different from other summery scents.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that Royal Hawaiian White Ginger cologne from the 1950&#x27;s and 1960&#x27;s, this isn&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s got a sweet note that takes away from the spicy scent I loved.</li>
    <li> Smell not strong and not quite on the mark for the white ginger fragrances I prefer.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  These are true scent of the islands.  Please create a better cap so that it doesn&#x27;t leak after you open it even if it closed tight.</li>
    <li> Easily fits into my travel carry on which is really handy for me as a consultant.  I really love the white ginger smell.  It is very light and so far no one has complained that the smell is offensive or causes them allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> I love Terra Nota perfumes but I really don&#x27;t want people to know that because I like keeping it my little secret. Haha. Great stuff. Delicious scent. I have tried lots of other perfumes touting island scents and none have ever measured up to Terra Nova&#x27;s quality and fantastic smell.</li>
    <li> I am a picky person, and after smelling white ginger during my hikes in Hawaii, I never thought I&#x27;d find a perfume that smelled just like it. I even started looking in Hawaii, smelling ginger perfumes in stores, before we left. I couldn&#x27;t find anything close enough. I saw this on Amazon and decided to take a chance after reading reviews. I LOVE it. Smells just like the real thing and going to order more.</li>
    <li> I keep looking for the same wonderful light white ginger perfume in the pretty bottle that I bought in Kuauii.  A friend found some like it in Mauii.  This is not it.  It is too strong.</li>
    <li> Wish the fragrance would last longer, it is so nice!  It has such a refreshing scent; I love it.  Very unusual and delightful scent.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this perfume for Christmas. One of her favorites and mine too. Not over powering like most perfumes.</li>
    <li> A very little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s not strong, just beautifully distinctive, spicy, fainty floral, not like the usual &amp;#34;who rolled in the florist&#x27;s dumpster&amp;#34; flower fragrances.</li>
    <li> When I was younger, there was a wonderful white ginger perfume that is no longer made, so I was delighted to find that this one is just the same. It brings back fond memories.</li>
    <li> Have had random people compliment the scent--even asking if I am wearing Kai.  By contrast the Perfujmes of Hawaii White Ginger Cologne Spray was a disaster.</li>
    <li> Scent is nothing like white ginger; smells like lily of the valley. Very disappointed.</li>
