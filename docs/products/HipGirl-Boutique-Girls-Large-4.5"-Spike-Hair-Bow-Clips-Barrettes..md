<li> They are pretty big.</li>
<li> but this is no big deal as you just pull on them a little to get them back in to shape.</li>
<li> Considered sending back, but not worth the hassle.</li>
<li> They came in a little squeezed in so you will have to fluff them a little</li>
<li> Previous reviewers said they were a little scrunched down when they got them</li>
<li> They were just as small as the other bows that I order</li>
<li> Sometimes when you buy a large assortment they throw in crazy combos you wouldn&#x27;t have chosen</li>
<li> You could even use on pig tails since they are not huge bows.</li>
<li> so i had to unbend each bow because they were crammed in one small box.</li>
<li> I was very skeptical - the price I paid (averaged at about two dollars per bow) seemed too low.</li>
<li> Dont get me wrong</li>
<li> Really disappointed.</li>

    <li> This was great shipping time. We love the bows my daughter have so many diffrent color outfits with the bows to match we will be ordering again soon. Great price and perfect size.</li>
    <li> Dont get me wrong these bows were pretty however they seem to me much smaller than advertise. What i received in the mail was not a 4.5 bow for sure. They were just as small as the other bows that I order that was a size 3. Really disappointed. Also they were receive bent up so i had to unbend each bow because they were crammed in one small box. I normally love hipgirl bows but i wont be ordering from this supplier anymore. The bows looked just okay. Considered sending back, but not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter loves these bows and wears one to school every day. i may buy more for my other granddaughters.</li>
