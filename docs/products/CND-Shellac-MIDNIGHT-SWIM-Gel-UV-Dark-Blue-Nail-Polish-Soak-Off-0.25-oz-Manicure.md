      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, especially when it catches the light.</li>

      <li>Rich texture and depth in color.</li>
      <li>It is dark, but it&#x27;s just a beautiful, rich color and when it&#x27;s in the sunlight it has a non-tacky glitter look.</li>

      <li>Our whole family loves the CND Shellac products, and this particular color is simply gorgeous, and so easy to vary in exciting ways, with the addition of foils, and dark glitters!</li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a blue.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s a high recommendation!</li>
      <li>I really like Midnight Swim.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant to buy it because I wasn&#x27;t sure if the color would be professional enough to wear to work, but I think it works.  </li>
      <li>It really does go on as easily a regular polish and it soaks off in about 8 minutes.  </li>
      <li>and I want to look professional at work.</li>
      <li>I have tried OPI and a few other soak off gels at my nail salon but CND is by far the easiest product to soak off and is kind to your nails.</li>
      <li>Seems to hold up well, dried nice and hard.</li>
      <li>I was really  nervous about buying it since I knew it&#x27;d be dark.</li>

    <li> Very good coverage could almost get by with one coat.  Deep blue with a bit of shimmer. I added just a touch of glitter at the tips and just love the effect. Seems to hold up well, dried nice and hard. Perfect when you don&#x27;t want to go all the way to black but aren&#x27;t feeling like RED.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> Our whole family loves the CND Shellac products, and this particular color is simply gorgeous, and so easy to vary in exciting ways, with the addition of foils, and dark glitters!</li>
    <li> Great product, price, &amp; shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> great color! This color goes on strong and I really am excited to wear this color this winter! love it</li>
    <li> I love the color, it will be beautiful this fall and winter. I can not wait to use it. It&#x27;s a little early in the season for me to wear this dark of a color. BUT SOON!</li>
    <li> I love the CND shellac power polishes.  They go on well.  They stay on for 2 weeks, while remaining shiny, and they don&#x27;t damage your nail. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because the color was too dark for me.</li>
    <li> This rates 5 stars because the color is extraordinary...I thought it was a navy but it&#x27;s a slightly softer blue color and it has a slight glittery effect.  Love the way it looks!&lt;br /&gt;I love the Shellac products and this new color allows me to switch out the pinks, french tips, etc. with a more dramatic nighttime look.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any of the ladies who love to have beautiful hands and nails.  My daughters-in-law even liked it&lt;br /&gt; and that&#x27;s a high recommendation!</li>
    <li> I am in love this color! Didn&#x27;t realize when I saw it online that it has tiny turquoise sparkles in it. It&#x27;s beautiful, especially when it catches the light.</li>
    <li> I really like Midnight Swim.  I was hesitant to buy it because I wasn&#x27;t sure if the color would be professional enough to wear to work, but I think it works.  It&#x27;s dark enough to not look juvenile.  When the light hits it, it is very sparkly.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful deep blue with the perfect amount of sparkle. With the shellac topcoat, this color has serious depth. I got TONS of compliments wearing this.</li>
    <li> A deep midnight blue with sparkles.  It is a great winter color.</li>
    <li> This color (Midnight Swim) is so dark it is almost black.  I was expecting more of a blue.  In bright light you can see the blue better and also see the sparkles.  Any other time, it looks black.  It is a UV Shellac that requires the use of a UV light to cure.  Holds up well to daily wear.</li>
    <li> I love this color, its beautiful with bling, its a great blue color and it was sent in the proper time limit after ordering</li>
    <li> I love their products!  So easy to use and it does last for a minimum of 2 weeks, if you apply it the way it instructs, though, sometimes, I do change color once a week, not because it has chipped, but because I want a different color.  It really does go on as easily a regular polish and it soaks off in about 8 minutes.  Just follow the directions and you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color! I was really  nervous about buying it since I knew it&#x27;d be dark. I&#x27;m an elementary teacher and I want to look professional at work. It is dark, but it&#x27;s just a beautiful, rich color and when it&#x27;s in the sunlight it has a non-tacky glitter look. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great color- midnight blue w/ tiny blue glitter.  Very fun!</li>
    <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s a dark navy. It has some sparkle but not a lot. I was shopping yesterday and had several people comment on how well they like it.</li>
    <li> The color on the picture is actually darker than it really is, it actually has some greenish shade and that is why I am not using it often...</li>
    <li> I have tried OPI and a few other soak off gels at my nail salon but CND is by far the easiest product to soak off and is kind to your nails.</li>
    <li> Rich texture and depth in color. Shimmers in the right light but looks professional and trendy as well. Love it!</li>
    <li> Looks black. If you like that, go for it.</li>
