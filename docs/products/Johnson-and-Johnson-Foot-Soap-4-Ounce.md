      <li>Get yourself a good old fashion sink tub, (bought a nice sturdy rubbermaid here @amazon)....</li>

      <li>Who knew you could fall in love with the same foot soap my great grandmother had in her bathroom cabinet?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Johnson&#x27;s for over 20 years now easy.  </li>
      <li>Ended up just slightly more than private label brand at Walgreen&#x27;s for a trusted brand at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is by far the most superior product of everything I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>I do my own pedicures now because my feet feel and look better after this foot soak than spending money on a professional pedicure.  </li>

      <li>I get a plastic bin with very warm water and marbles in the bottom for a nice little foot massage.  </li>
      <li>Pretty potent out of the box but fine when soaking.  </li>
      <li>I recommend making your own soak of tepid water a little of your favorite soap and finsh off with a nice oil rub.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to find it in several stores but to date, have not been successful.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time and love the suds I get&lt;</li>
      <li>a bit high priced but a good product, it really did soften the callus on my feet and sooth the skin</li>
      <li>but the relief it does provide is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and a God send when your feet are really hurting.</li>
      <li>But if you care not to venture out and save your footsies, its very reasonably priced here on Amazon and shipped free when bundled.  </li>
      <li>This soap made my feet so soft &amp; moisturized, its perfect when using a callus shaver on the soles of the feet to remove dead skin.</li>
      <li>Since I shop frequently at Amazon, I was able to get this delivered fast and shipping free.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my feet feel so soft.</li>
      <li>Get some very hot water, as hot as you can stand, and a packet of foot soap, stir it up, and just watch at TV show.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I endured the messy and my feet felt good as with any soak but nothing special.</li>
      <li>Ok, i haven&#x27;t actually tried this yet SO.....</li>
      <li>But now that I am walking and exercising a lot more its been a regular standby for me.  </li>
      <li>my skin is so smooth and soft...</li>
      <li>I used many different foot soaks</li>
      <li>Excellent foot soap although some what expensive</li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s cheaper on here on amazon.....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used it for the first time and love the suds I get&lt;br /&gt;It smelled good too and softened my skin well.&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
    <li> I am, unfortunately, one of those people who develops calluses and whose heels crack.  I felt as if scrubbing with a pumice was doing nothing.  I discovered that 20 minutes of soaking in this magical product followed by some scrubbing did the trick.  I also just find it so wonderfully relaxing after a day on my feet.  I am already on my second box and assume that this will become a regular part of my routine.</li>
    <li> a bit high priced but a good product, it really did soften the callus on my feet and sooth the skin</li>
    <li> I have a lot of foot problems, from aching feet when on them too long, to skin issues around the toes. There are times when I come home from work that my feet hurt so bad, I can barely walk. Soaking in this every night is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that provides any relief, including soaking in Epsom Salt. Granted, it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;.....only staying off my feet does that....but the relief it does provide is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and a God send when your feet are really hurting.</li>
    <li> This is, without a doubt, the best foot soap on the market. I&#x27;ve tried to find it in several stores but to date, have not been successful.</li>
    <li> I had used this product for years.  All of a sudden, it seemed to disappear from the shelves so I used other products.  While some of the products worked quite well, I still missed my Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap and when I saw it listed on Amazon.com..I ordered as much as I could carry.</li>
    <li> This product soothes and softens your feet.&lt;br /&gt;It is not actually meant to clean, as it isn&#x27;t a  soap.&lt;br /&gt;It is actually meant to be a soak for weary or rough feet.&lt;br /&gt;This works beautifully. It is pure pleasure to feel the water&lt;br /&gt;slipping over your feet.. softening as you soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is hard to find in stores these days. Amazon has once again&lt;br /&gt;not disappointed .. It took me only seconds to find it here. I recommend&lt;br /&gt;this for men and women alike.. try it! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Johnson&#x27;s for over 20 years now easy.  It used to be that I would only use a packet here and there when a lot of overtime at work would leave my feet tired and sore. But now that I am walking and exercising a lot more its been a regular standby for me.  It&#x27;s really a good thing that Johnson&#x27;s works so well.  For unless you want to go to one of those natural health and beauty stores, (or shop similar items here on Amazon) and spend quite a bit more money, you don&#x27;t have much of a choice as far as foot soaps, (or soak) in your local drug store.  Dr. Sholls used to have there own foot soak out, but I haven&#x27;t seen it in years now.  I have tried some of the other fancier foot soaks with tea tree oil and found them to be excellent as well, but more expensive.  This old standby with Borax soothes tired sore feet excellently in a soak, or just a big pot of hot water.  Its easily found in local stores.  But if you care not to venture out and save your footsies, its very reasonably priced here on Amazon and shipped free when bundled.  Enjoy the comfort....</li>
    <li> I used this all the time... to soak my feet or put in a hot bath to soak my tired body.... its great! and when I get out of the tub my skin is so smooth and soft...I will need to order another box soon!!!</li>
    <li> All I can do is invite you to try it. Get some very hot water, as hot as you can stand, and a packet of foot soap, stir it up, and just watch at TV show. Maybe wiggle your toes a little. When my feet are tired and sore, this really works wonders. It&#x27;s a simple, old fashioned remedy that&#x27;s worth the time and trouble, and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> NOTHING MAKES YOUR FEET FEEL AS GOOD AS JOHNSON&#x27;S FOOT SOAP.  IT IS A MIRACLE!</li>
    <li> My husband hates feet. He always has. I love foot rubs. See the dilemma? Well, after soaking my feet in this once a week there is really no battle over the random request for a foot rub. My feet are softer, and smoother. I have used this stuff for years and it is a weekly MUST for me! I wear high heels all the time, and without this foot soap I am afraid of what my feet would look and feel like.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my foot massager but , To my surprise you can&#x27;t use it in the air sauna ones So I just use it like suggested . Iv always used this Nothing like it after a day at work . Keep your feet in good shape . That&#x27;s the Best advise I can give in Life .</li>
    <li> This is great after a long shift on my feet to sit down and soak my feet is wonderful. This foot soap really takes that ache away.</li>
    <li> Reduces soar feet quite noticeably. Good price.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and a bath with Johnson’s sooths &amp; helps clear my skin and scalp.  This a a great alternative to the medication offered by doctors that can have side effects</li>
    <li> Do not bother with others you find in your drugstore or at Target or anywhere else . . . buy Johnsons.  It is by far the most superior product of everything I have ever tried.  You will be totally amazed how wonderful it is.  I will always be a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> It makes foot comfortable. But since it is powder, try not to breath it in. otherwise you will sneeze and cough.</li>
    <li> I got this foot soak to put into a foot massage my boyfriend had got me for valentine&#x27;s day.&lt;br /&gt;It smells rather bad. And it bubbles WAY too much. However, it does leave your foot feeling smooth and relaxed. But I can&#x27;t get past the smell. If you can, then go for this. That&#x27;s my main issue with this, otherwise I&#x27;d give it five stars. If you&#x27;re gonna use lotion or something after this soak, the I&#x27;d say for for it!</li>
    <li> I WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE POOR FEED BACK ON THIS ITEM AND CHANGE IT TO A 5 STAR  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap is a superior product.  It is much better than it&#x27;s imitators. [Amazon is making this rating too hard.]</li>
    <li> Love the soap. Have eczema on the bottom of my feet and this definitely helps soothe them.  If you use the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Foot Spa, only use about a third of the packet as it bubbles up and makes a mess.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever come across for relieving aching, tired feet, after a 20 minute soak in warm water containing a packet or two of this foot soap, my feet feel totally rejuvenated with toenails and caluses softened prior to a pedicure.. I have recently ordered several packets of this foot soap from Amazon, because not all pharmacies stock this item.</li>
    <li> This went with hubbys foot spa. He loved it! helps soothe tired feet. He has neuropathy, and got drs OK</li>
    <li> Do you love your feet? Do you spend time caring for your toes, making sure your foot health is all it can be? Do you reward your feet for their service? Think about what they do for you each day; how they carry you around. Do they complain? Well, for many people the answer is yes, they do complain, they do hurt, and they need some loving care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, here is part of your answer: Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap. I bought the product from Amazon, it came really fast and at a reasonable cost, and I use it to soak my feet several times a week in a large plastic container (also purchased through Amazon). The soap comes in pouches -- pour a pouch into water as hot as you can tolerate, and then slowly lower your feet into the mix. Now, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, but it looks a little clumpy and weird. And when you pour out the used water, it may look like washwater from the back of a country diner -- yuck! But don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s all good. Your feet will look, smell, and BE clean, happy, relaxed, and much more healthy than before. This is truly self love. In our world (don&#x27;t let me get to preaching here...). In our world, self love can be the last thing on our daily to-do list, something that we easily forget or just don&#x27;t have time for. Well, when it comes to foot care, you must make time. Your feet deserve the care, and the more you get into the habit of caring for yourself, the healthier you&#x27;ll be, both mentally and physically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually also use a great antibiotic soap on my feet and legs before I soak them in the Johnson&#x27;s product, and then I thoroughly dry them after the soak, and verbally affirm their value. I believe in this. (You don&#x27;t have to believe anything I mention or suggest, and I actually urge you NOT to believe anything unless it is true for YOU!) By verbally affirming my feet and legs as I dry them, I am taking the time to really care for myself, to express gratitude, and to be in a health place that definitely affects me all over. But as I say, you must do what works for you. And if you only soak your feet once a month, that&#x27;s a start. Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap is a great product at a very reasonable cost from Amazon. You can&#x27;t go wrong with that! God bless your feet!I say, you must do what works for you. And if you only soak your feet once a month, that&#x27;s a start. Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap is a great product at a very reasonable cost from Amazon. You can&#x27;t go wrong with that! God bless your feet!</li>
    <li> First, it&#x27;s cheaper on here on amazon..... this stuff is so amazing on my feet. when my feet are cramped and hurting, I soak them in this stuff and it makes them soft and relaxed. I will ALWAYS have this stuff on hand!</li>
    <li> This wonderful foot soak is not just for the feet...I can also soak away my aches in the tub. It really does help.  My only advice is to store it in a plastic bag or the smell will take your breath away. Pretty potent out of the box but fine when soaking.  Also, if using in the bathtub, **be very careful you don&#x27;t slip.** It makes my tub a little slippery.</li>
    <li> GOOOOD STUUUUUFFFF!!!!!</li>
    <li> This soap works very well.  It softens my feat and makes them relaxed and at ease.  I just wish I had more time to sit to soak my feet more often. I have found that I can soak them while I check my email in the evenings.  I just mix up a packet into some warm water placed in a plastic tub I bought at a local discount store for a few dollars and place it and a small hand towel under my home office desk. I highly recommend this product because it does work.</li>
    <li> I have rheumatoid arthritis in my feet and hands...this foot soap absolutely is effective with the pain. It also softens the callouses and the skin. It&#x27;s heavenly....it works!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Johnson&#x27;s foot soak is wonderful.  I don&#x27;t understand why I can&#x27;t find it locally.  Since I have tried it, I can&#x27;t imagine not having it available.  I do my own pedicures now because my feet feel and look better after this foot soak than spending money on a professional pedicure.  I am a nurse also, and there is nothing better than coming home after a hard day and soaking my feet with this.</li>
    <li> I have used Johnson&#x27;s foot soap many times and I find it perfect for pedicures.  It&#x27;s helps give your feet a perfect soap and wash during a pedicure.  It does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Excellent foot soap although some what expensive</li>
    <li> I like oat meal but not on my feet. It did not disolve and stuff is floating around on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I endured the messy and my feet felt good as with any soak but nothing special. I recommend making your own soak of tepid water a little of your favorite soap and finsh off with a nice oil rub.</li>
    <li> Big disappointment ...ordered along with a jet spa footbath..but couldn&#x27;t use it in there because it is full of particles that don&#x27;t dissolve - why are the sold together?  Then the smell of it was terrible, and after taking my feet out of the bathtub, they were so itchy, had to wash with real soap and take a Benadryl .  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> I have been using Johnsons for years and recomend it to everyone. If you are on your feet a lot I would recomend a weekly/byweekly soak in Johnsons.</li>
    <li> I am on my feet all day. My feet were feeling so tired some days and my sister reminded me of the Johnson&#x27;s foot soap my grandmother used to soak her feet when we were children. I purchased the product and my feet received a new lease on life. They felt brand new after 20 minutes soaking in the Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap. I will keep this on hand.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful for softening your feet.  I have a&#x3D;had extensive surgery on my feet and I use this to keep my feet soft and in shape for walking. Very relaxing in hot water.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying to those of you thinking about buying a pricey \\&quot;foot spa\\&quot;, please dont bother. They&#x27;re the pits. they&#x27;re expensive + all their gadgets are useless plus they&#x27;re a true pain in the ..feet to keep clean. Get yourself a good old fashion sink tub, (bought a nice sturdy rubbermaid here @amazon)....Who knew you could fall in love with the same foot soap my great grandmother had in her bathroom cabinet? I&#x27;ve read the other reviews + know we all sound like feet freaks but i cant help it. i had these half inch thick callus&#x27;s on the heels of my feet that practically came off on their own after just 1 use of this stuff. seriously, with the gentlest swipe of my pumice stone it, my feet dont just feel better, the literally look 20yrs younger. I&#x27;m not exaggerating. And cutting my toenails was like cutting thru butter. What else can i say? HAPPY FEET! ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FOOT SOAK!!!! I work 12+ hrs on my feet I used many different foot soaks but this one works the best for me.</li>
    <li> I have used Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap for years and was very unhappy when I couldn&#x27;t find it after a move to California.  I was very pleased and excited when it became available at Amazon.  The price was unbelievable, but the quality is still the same.  If you have any problem with tired, achy feet, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I stand all day at my job, so I wanted a good foot soak solution.  I was taken back a bit when I poured it in, and it turned the water brown. It also has a certain medical smell to it. Aesthically, it was not pleasing, but it felt very good to my feet. I soaked them for about 20 mins.  When I pulled my feet out, they felt like baby toes.&lt;br /&gt;But after leaving the solution in my footpan over night, I poured it out the next morning to find it turned into jelly. I don&#x27;t know what that was about, but just be sure to pour it out soon after using. :)</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my feet feel so soft.I put a pack in my foot massager and it soothe my aching feet.It also made it easier to remove the dead skin from my feet.Love it, will purchase it again.I also brought this with the  MelodySusie Multifunction 4-in-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning which works great together.</li>
    <li> This is a great old product and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available, same formula.&lt;br /&gt;My mother used to say \\&quot;if your feet hurt, everything hurts\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;To me it&#x27;s uplifting to have a nice foot soak, and it makes the skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this , especially if you&#x27;re on your feet a lot or in heels .</li>
    <li> Ok, i haven&#x27;t actually tried this yet SO.....disregard this review if this kind of info is not interesting or important to you but the second ingredient is  this : [...]&lt;br /&gt;And prolonged exposure might not be a great idea.</li>
    <li> Foot soap good for my daughter&#x27;s feet.</li>
    <li> Best hot bath soak ever.....you feel so relaxed yet kinda energized</li>
    <li> Bought this along with Conair Fb52 Hydrotherapy Massaging Foot Spa.  The best foot soap, soak!  I do believe you should only use half a packet for just your feet.  After a 20 minute soak and then a pumice stone, my feet are so soft!  I finish it all off with AmLactin Foot Cream Therapy (3 oz) for the softest feet ever!  After having the hardest calluses ever, you would never know by looking at my feet now!  A must buy combination!!</li>
    <li> Great product!!!!  Has kept my old (83) feet soft, smooth, free of lumps, bumps, corns, dry skin !!  PLEASE DO NOT STOP MANUFACTURING IT !!!!!</li>
    <li> This soap made my feet so soft &amp; moisturized, its perfect when using a callus shaver on the soles of the feet to remove dead skin. It just soaks the dead skin &amp; makes removal very easy. Its a bang for your buck, I would purchase this soap again.</li>
    <li> I love this foot soak!  I get a plastic bin with very warm water and marbles in the bottom for a nice little foot massage.  I pour in the foot soak, wait 20 minutes, use my pumice stone then slather on my foot lotion.  It is a my 20 minutes of heaven every Sunday.  Try it (with the marbles), you will love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I hope it&#x27;s available for as long as I live. I work on my feet all day and it takes a tole. This product soothes my aching feet, leaves them feeling soft and fresh. This stuff is great for corns, calluses and all sorts of foot pains. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Makes my feet softer than anything else I tried in the past. I wish I could find it in local stores.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered...thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Close to a miracle soup. Literally. A simple product that works well, without a lot of hype associated with other products.</li>
    <li> This is an add on item, from Amazon.  Since I shop frequently at Amazon, I was able to get this delivered fast and shipping free.  Ended up just slightly more than private label brand at Walgreen&#x27;s for a trusted brand at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be re-ordering when the need arises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap ...is great for soaking your feet in a hot ...vibrating massage soaker ....relieves aches and soothes the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lot&#x27;s of good foot baths to choose from on Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> If you walk around barefoot alot then you more than likely may have some dead skin or callouses on the bottom of your feet. This will soften it up and cleanse in order to remove those things. It used to be sold in Walmart but has recently been discontinued there. I would recommend buying it from here and using it as well.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Rapid delivery!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced and really works on the callouses that build up by wearing sandals. it was very hard to find in our local stores.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Sometimes my feet feel as though they have been rubbed raw. This soothes and cools my feet. I recommend keeping this on hand.</li>
    <li> Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap was recommened to me by&lt;br /&gt;an elderly aunt who used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Sure economical and better then a pedicure&lt;br /&gt;or manicure.&lt;br /&gt;By brushing feet- in water -  when done it helps the cuticle on my fingers&lt;br /&gt;Love it..</li>
    <li> This is just heavenly to be able to soak your feet in.  Very refreshing and really relaxes your tired feet.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I get dry and callus feet a lot. This eliminates that but soothes at the same time. My husband even uses it :)</li>
    <li> This product feels very good on your feet! Soaking in a foot bath it is silky smooth and leaves the silky feel on your feet long after washing it away. Be careful using in a foot tub that creates Jacuzzi-like bubbles because suds will pile up high! lol This is a great aid to cleansing, relaxing, soaking, exfoliating, and softening out your feet!! :D</li>
    <li> My mom used this for years and you could find it every where. Now mom is gone and I have searched for years and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores. So I went to the internet. What a great find!!!!!</li>
