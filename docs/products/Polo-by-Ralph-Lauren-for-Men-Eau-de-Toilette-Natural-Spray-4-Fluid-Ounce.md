<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My boyfriends favorite and it was a great price.</li>
    <li> Sophisticated and timeless.  Reminds me of a time growing up when my father hugged me and the scent burned in my memory forever.  I still love it and selectively use it.  Very masculine and traditional.  A really great scent years later!</li>
    <li> ********** Review has been edited by me************&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 4oz version from Amazon when I got the bottle, around the neck and&lt;br /&gt;sprayer it was leaking there was no damage to the box or shipping package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister had bought me a bottle of Polo years ago for Christmas this smells nothing&lt;br /&gt;like the bottle I had before its almost like its watered down in fact the English Leather black&lt;br /&gt;I bought almost smells the same. Now the WARNING I found out you can&#x27;t exchange the damaged one&lt;br /&gt;for a new bottle so I&#x27;m out $60.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some reviews about some Polo cologne may be fake I&#x27;m wondering now if Amazon my have fallen victim to a bad knock off batch themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The good news about Polo green if you get a good bottle you will love it 5 stars all the way. I had to give 3 star Review because of what I got a broken maybe even a knock off bottle of Polo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************UPDATE As always Amazon comes though this is why we love them they are always fair and&lt;br /&gt;trust worthy when a problem happens its not just empty promises they take action.************</li>
    <li> Great price! Will do business again!</li>
    <li> I recommend to anyone. Great product. I love this cologne on my husband. Smells good on my husband &amp; he was wearing this cologne the day I met him.100% wonderful</li>
    <li> This cologne was exactly what I wanted.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years, and I get a lot of favorable comments from perfect strangers.</li>
    <li> This was a request from my son.  Smells really nice!</li>
    <li> The polo colon is a nice piece too my collection thanks a bunch! !!!!</li>
    <li> Call me old-fashioned (scent from the 80&#x27;s), but, this is the only scent I continue to get compliments on.  Long lasting, and from Lauren, this product wears great, smells just manly enough, and last through the day and evening!</li>
    <li> Ralph Lauren Polo is my husbands favorite cologne... I ordered this for our anniversary &amp; because he was almost out... The price was perfect, as always &amp; now he smells delightful ;)</li>
    <li> My favorite scent for a man, very cool and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is another spray to have in your collection.  The fragrance is very appealing, and is long lasting.  Spray twice. Done!</li>
    <li> Ii bought this for my husband because our Pastors have worn it for years and I dearly love it!  Now I get to smell it on my husband! It is the best manly smell out there and it does not bother my allergies as so many cologne&#x27;s do - men or women&#x27;s.  The newer colognes have an ingredient in them that gives me an instant headache.  I highly recommend Polo, the original in the Green bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this</li>
    <li> Smells good if you&#x27;re 100 and live in a home. Other than that don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> Never go wrong with Ralph Lauren!</li>
    <li> Old man have not change since this has been out</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FROM A GREAT SUPPLIER......THANKS</li>
    <li> Everything was as they said. I got it in perfect  time and conditions .  Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> WARNING!!! FAKE - UNREAL - DON&amp;#34;T BUY!!! After wearing Polo since the 80&#x27;s I was excited to go Ol&#x27; Skool and purchase a nice size bottle. Having ordered several times online I felt secure through a seemingly credible company i figured certainly vetted their partners. But was I surprised... The scent is NOT polo. It&#x27;s a knockoff. It&#x27;s smell horrible. I paid 60 bucks - Didn&#x27;t feel like going through the hassle of refunds, etc. This is my second post - they would not post the first one though it followed their guidelines - hope this one makes it. Could save you lots of $$$</li>
    <li> Not the scent that I am looking for, I think that I am used to the type without the spray on it...  it may be more concentrated.... this is not the sellers fault...</li>
    <li> Last bottle I received had no smell at all after 5 or 6 uses. I threw the bottle away and bought some from Belk in a gift set of two bottles. Both are great with no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 1986 and it hasn&#x27;t lost its effects.  Smells great and sprays on evenly.  I recommend it for any young to middle aged man.</li>
    <li> I purchased Polo Eau de Toilette, having used the product years ago. The current formula seems a bit heavy with the &#x27;tobacco&#x27; component of the smell. I initially was very turned off by this, but it kind of grew on me.   I would caution you to buy this in a store so you can smell it for yourself and make sure it&#x27;s what you want.</li>
    <li> Smelled old.  Unfortunately for your wallet, it&#x27;s probably best to buy cologne/perfume at the store.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite - hers. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s important</li>
    <li> Others have written they had received a fake product... hard to believe since I also did the smell test and they are identical to what I have purchased from stores. I have used Polo Green for 20 plus years.</li>
    <li> Liked the Polo fragrance, more than 20 years.  Still the same, with a huge difference now, scent only last for an hour, the eau the toilette is the only way this Polo is available.  Maybe will not buy it anymore.  Use a fragrance just to last during lunch or dinner?</li>
    <li> Wondering if the what I received was a knock-off product. I have been using the product for over 20 years. This flagrance is not same as original and not surprisingly, the bottle cover does not quite fit either.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as was ordered. :-)</li>
    <li> Great smell and price.</li>
    <li> It definitely works and the smell is long lasting, but no one has given me any compliments or have said anything to me about this cologne, so I just don;t know if it&#x27;s fully effective like I wanted it to be just yet.</li>
    <li> twice the amount at the same price at my local stores. How could you go wrong. Excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> Great &#x27;oldy&#x27; that my hubby has worn for years.</li>
    <li> Authentic item, best price ever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this since the early &#x27;70s when I was a teen and will never change it.  Great MEN&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of Polo in the late 80s.  This is the scent that I remember, and at a good price!</li>
    <li> excellent product, using it for years.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite scent. Package and contents were in new condition and the representation of the product was accurate. Probably never shop for this product in a store again.</li>
    <li> Paid a very good price and I am very satisfied. The product arrived so quickly. I was impressed at the ease of access to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a really good smelling eau de toilette. Amazon gives you a really good discount as well. Every gentleman should have a bottle of this in his bathroom.</li>
    <li> Great deal, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years, and now I get it for a good price.</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell of this &amp;#34;Green&amp;#34; version of the Ralph Lauren product. It is a very strong scent and my recommendation is to get a sampler from a retail store before you buy.</li>
    <li> Smell is different and off. This is a fake 😡 cheated !!!</li>
    <li> Husbands favorite. Service and price was excellent.</li>
    <li> the fragrance is not original</li>
    <li> Great deal on this, and shipped quick</li>
    <li> Good stuff ! Not sure if its still the same?</li>
    <li> This can&#x27;t be the real thing.  Hubby had been wearing for over a year.  When he was out we bought this.  Smell is off and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today went to the mall and spent another $68 on the real deal.  Have the bottles side by side and you CAN smell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emailed amazon for help.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product....Will purchase again.  Seller sent items really fast. I highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The spray is like the every other Ralph Lauren product , it last and you can tell its not cheap</li>
    <li> Recieved coogne in a timley manner and was the REAL stuff!</li>
    <li> Exactly what was advertised love it</li>
    <li> It lives up to it&#x27;s reputation and consistency. This is a very personal choice. The price is better than other sources.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite scent at the best possible price. What more needs to be said?</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My son-in-law loves Polo spray.  Almost impossible to find in the stores.  Bought this for his birthday and was so happy.  Now I&#x27;m looking for the same polo in after shave and can not find it..</li>
    <li> it is not too citrus and has a classic scent that is timeless.  Ever since a woman told me that her bed had the scent of Polo on it that reminded her of last night, I was hooked.</li>
    <li> Original Polo (green) was the first 80&#x27;s scent that made your knees buckle from euphoria.The fragrance, still to this day, is timeless. Pure Male, Pure Wealth, Pure Reagan era extravagance. Makes you feel alive. This effect will last ALL day and night.</li>
    <li> I love Polo in it original form.  Its a great standby for any occasion and I always receive compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Polo is a great scent. I like the way it  makes my skin feel. The scent is also very long lasting.</li>
    <li> his is real good stuff not bad for price</li>
    <li> Polo is the best scent for me.  Have received more compliments than any other.  The expense is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Gift for my hubby and he loves his cologne. Ladies you can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne:) is a must get.</li>
    <li> Best cologne going - for my individual skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the smell of Polo on a man. As a woman, this is the only men&#x27;s fragrance that I can honestly say &amp;#34;knocks my socks off&amp;#34;!  Every time I catch a whiff on a man walking by, I have to stop and enjoy the moment. Nothing else even compares.</li>
    <li> My dad wears no other... Bottle box pak was just put in a small box...no cushy plastic pillows. Was surprised it made it in one piece.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this sent on me and I enjoy it as well. We have tryed several others and other than the Polo Sport witch I use as well, I keep coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used polo green for many years and amazon makes it so easy to order, shipped right to my house at a reasonable price. I was worried that this Polo was a knock off but it&#x27;s the real thing, arriving quickly.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like crap</li>
    <li> finaly have this product</li>
    <li> That tantalizing scent that makes women notice you, when you&#x27;re done wearing the kid stuff, Step Up</li>
    <li> Started &amp;#34;wearing&amp;#34; this fragrance in the 80s when it was introduced.  I have had a consistent feeling about it and did NOT wear it only when I had difficulty finding it offered by many stores.  It seems to me that the newer Polo fragrances are nowhere as good.  Glad I found a place to get it.</li>
    <li> Was shipped and received as expected.</li>
    <li> Loved the content of the green glass, but was disappointed that it was not in the green &amp;#34;Polo&amp;#34; box and didn&#x27;t have all the &amp;#34;Polo&amp;#34; insignias as featured...</li>
    <li> Order was delivered on time as stated and is the real deal.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. My husband has been wearing it for years. Packed well and speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing polo since the 1980&#x27;s, I  don&#x27;t know what this is. comes in right box and bottle but NOT polo. sadly I can&#x27;t return it. waited to long by a few weeks, I didn&#x27;t try it until I  finished my other polo bottle. I should have tried it when I first got it.this is the first fake product I&#x27;ve ever gotten from amazon. I&#x27;ll never buy cologne on amazon again.</li>
    <li> but give him Polo! My husband loves this stuff and it is getting harder and harder to find. Thank God for Amazon! So he is a happy camper to have his green Polo once again.</li>
    <li> I am always getting complimented on how i good smell and because of that i feel more confident when wearing this product.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the &amp;#34;POLO&amp;#34; scent I have used for years. Either they have changed the formula or it is counterfeit</li>
    <li> Excellent product and value.</li>
    <li> best product in this market</li>
    <li> The product is good. It is as announced. The volume is the adequate to avoid it loose it’s validate. It has a good cost benefit relation.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Polo on my guy.</li>
    <li> Just what was asked for. My husband had wanted this for Christmas and he was very grateful to be able to have it</li>
    <li> I always used Polo green by Ralph Lauren. The fragrance is deeply striking, and I identified myself with this product. Undoubtedly excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always good to do research on an item prior to purchase. That being said if you&#x27;re wondering about buying this product know that it is manufactured by Maybelline no longer RL. They&#x27;ve changed some of the ingredients that made the original so good. It is still a good sent but it is not what it used to be. I&#x27;ve had people tell me that they like my curve crush better and thats only 25$ For a 4oz jug.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Came quickly and exactly as described</li>
    <li> Received product in timely manner. Cologne smells horrible, nothing like its supposed to. Smells more like chemical or some kind of bug spray. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old product or just a knock off. Amazon does not allow exchanges or returns on cologne, I&#x27;m out $60.00  BUYER BEWARE</li>
    <li> I have always loved Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Polo fragrances, and I can honestly say I enjoy each and every one of them in some manner or another. However, Polo original is such a nostalgic scent, reminiscent of life&#x27;s simple little pleasures IMO, and therefore, has always been my favorite of the lot. It is smooth, woodsy, masculine, and well-refined from the second it touches your skin in the morning to the moment it softly wanes away in the twilight hours of evening. It really is unlike any of the other Polo fragrances. It is not sharp and edgy like Polo Black, not as mysterious or spicy as Double Black, and not as fruity as Polo Red, just classy. Admittedly, I preferred many of the softer, more modern scents growing up in middle school/high school such as Tommy Hilfiger, BKE, and Hollister SoCal, but now in my late twenties, I much prefer a classier fragrance over anything else and Polo Original can simply be summed up as the smell of a true gentleman.</li>
    <li> The ladies love it, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey, so I only use it on semi-special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I use Sierra I found on Ebay.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price and shipping.</li>
    <li> Great price! Great product. Fast shipping! After a lot of price comparing this was def the best out the for the amount and price.</li>
    <li> My Daddy&#x27;s favorite, plus  being a bigger size bottle for the price was excellent!</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  He ran out but I surprised him with two bottles.  One was from me and the other was from Hollywood dogs.&lt;br /&gt;He decided to try polo black and likes it, but the one in the green bottle is still number one to him.&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#x27;t you have polo TALC for men?</li>
    <li> timeless classic that never goes out of style.</li>
    <li> AS FAR AS I&#x27;M CONCERNED IT IS THE BEST.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s real- Or at least it smells real.  Looks the same as the one I buy at Dillards.  My father loved it, and he has been wearing the scent for 20 years.</li>
    <li> i have been wearing this cologne for over 20 years and this is the first time that i have worn it and no smell within 2 hours.  this has to be be either counterfeit or a bad batch of some sort.  i am not able to return it and i am trying to contact amazon for relief.  No more cologne from AMAZON.COM for me.</li>
    <li> Polo by Ralph Lauren is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne. And I love the way he smells every morning after he showers &amp; shaves! We will definitely purchase this product again!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My wife said it smelled sexy, good enough for me. She didn&#x27;t have to tell me twice. I have used it for 20 years and she never can get enough of the smell.</li>
    <li> My husband smells so good....This is a much better price than the department stores!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and seller.</li>
    <li> Just got mine and its the real deal 100%..I&#x27;ll be ordering again when I run out</li>
    <li> Great Eau de Toilette!!</li>
    <li> excellent, thanks you.</li>
    <li> My dad has worn this cologne for years... he loved this bottle, and says the ladies do too... Gross.... But great product! :)</li>
    <li> I bought my husband Polo for the first time 43 yrs ago when we were dating.  It&#x27;s such a manly, sexy, clean smell.  He&#x27;s worn it ever since.  Our anniversary is in Sept and we will hit 40 yrs.  He still gets compliments from other women wherever we go.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; (in the green packaging) Polo for Men!</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance for me and it was somewhat cheaper than I could buy locally, not much , but a savings.</li>
    <li> Most important, women love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Fake. Do not buy. You can easily detect fake 5 star rating by clicking on the reviewer&#x27;s other reviews.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Polo cologne for over 25 years.  I have always purchased from a major department store or a major retailer.  When I ran out I recently decided to use an Amazon gift card and purchase my Polo on Amazon, thinking I could save some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was sold through a marketplace seller.  I had read reviews about customers receiving counterfeit fragrances from Amazon marketplace sellers in the past, so I weeded through the sellers to find one that appeared to be legit.  In hindsight, I should have spent slightly more money and gone with the nationwide fragrance chain store that was also selling on Amazon.  Then I could have been certain that what I was ordering was legit and I could have stopped into their bricks and mortar store here locally if there were issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product packaging for my order was all top notch and very genuine looking.  The labels, wrapping, box, and even the printing on the bottle was all crisp and precise.  It passed my visual test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance smells the part, so that passed my sniffer test.  I thought all was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of daily use, here is what I can say:  this is not Polo cologne.  I had one final spritz left in my bottle that I had purchased from a major department store so I compared.  Wow, is there ever a difference between that fragrance and what I received from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the initial \\&quot;scent\\&quot; appears to be the same, the counterfeit loses its effectiveness after a couple of hours.  I have to apply it twice a day, using twice as many spritzes as I normally am accustomed to using.  This means I am actually using 4x as many spritzes as I was using with the genuine product.  With the genuine product, 1 spritz lasts the entire day for me.  With this counterfeit product, I have to use 2 spritzes in the morning and 2 in the afternoon to equal the 1 genuine spritz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with my purchase and I am in the process of notifyingAmazon customer service about a refund.  If what I received actually is a counterfeit and Polo didn&#x27;t just reformulate the product to make it weaker, then these marketplace sellers need to be vetted more carefully because this is not acceptable.  If I wanted to purchase a replica scent I would have gone to a replica source and paid a fraction of what I spent on this.  Not happy at all!</li>
    <li> Good product great value just like in the store. I will order again.</li>
    <li> bought for a friend he loved it Thanks for the fast delivery .</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery!!!nice!!😁</li>
    <li> Been using it for years!</li>
    <li> As always very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same as what you would purchase at a department store like Macy&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for nearly 30 years since my freshman year in college.</li>
    <li> Item não foi entregue na data programada. Estava em viagem e não pude levar o produto, haja vista a demora.</li>
    <li> Im sorry but this is not Polo</li>
    <li> I have been using Ralph Lauren Polo Green odt for many years, as it has a fragrance I enjoy wearing and often get nice comments about. I recently purchased another bottle on ebay, but when I opened it, it&#x27;s fragrance was weak and I assumed I had bought a fake. I then thought it would be safer to buy some from Amazon as they have a reputation for dealing with reputable companys. How dissapointed was I to find that this new perchase was no better than the last. Am I just unlucky? Is the market flooded with fakes,or has Ralph Lauren Polo green odt changed its ingredience?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled- This is not the real deal!!!! looks like but is FAKE</li>
    <li> Great classic strong musk smell. Reminds me of my father great for the price and love their other fragrances. Would definitely  recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought the item as a gift.  Not for myself.  Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come in a splash cologne.&lt;br /&gt;It was preferred as a splash.</li>
    <li> Great product as advertised, always a favorite.</li>
    <li> Stays for a long time</li>
    <li> Great Product - delivered as agreed</li>
    <li> Love this cologne, have for years.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. A great price compared to department stores.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  This has been my husband&#x27;s signature scent for as long as I&#x27;ve known him (you don&#x27;t want to know).  I&#x27;ve bought him other scents over the years, but this one is special. Some people search for the &amp;#34;right one&amp;#34; forever, and some are lucky enough to find it early, and stay loyal.  This one&#x27;s worth the loyalty.</li>
    <li> As a few people stated in other reviews, this is not the original polo.  I used to wear Polo exclusively, I loved it!  Maybelline is now producing Polo and they had to take out some of the ingredients like oak moss and replace them with something else because some people have allergies.  If you are allergic to it, don&#x27;t wear it, thats what my momma always told me, LOL!  Anyway, it smells more like alcohol than anything now.</li>
    <li> Here is another scent I am very fond of.  But the price of this stuff is out of this world.  So when I found it at this price, I sucked it up!  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery &amp; the best products. I am very happy</li>
