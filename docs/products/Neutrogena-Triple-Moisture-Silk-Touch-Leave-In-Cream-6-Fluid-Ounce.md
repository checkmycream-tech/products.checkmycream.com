      <li>seems to detangle nicely.  </li>
      <li>I liked this product.</li>
      <li>all it does is sit on top of my hair and it doesnt even moistureize it good either.</li>

      <li>This is the best leave-in I have found so far.  </li>
      <li>Then I couldn&#x27;t find it any more and kind of forgot about it.  </li>
      <li>I first tried this product because of the reviews and I&#x27;m very glad I did!</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>The cream is very light on your hair and provides moisture</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was packaged well. I ordered this for a family member.&lt;br /&gt;She loves this and says it&#x27;s the only thing that really helps her hair not to be tangled and frizzy.</li>
    <li> Awesome leave on. I loved the c</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I heard so much buzz about it but I don&#x27;t think its for me. The cream is very light on your hair and provides moisture but I need more moisture. This product was okay but once again I don&#x27;t think its for me.</li>
    <li> The products works very well, especially for the price. It&#x27;s glycerine content adds a little weight to my frizzy hair and makes it shine instead of absorb light. The moisturizing effect last for maybe 1.5 days (but this is probably just because my 4a hair gets super thirst sometimes lol)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great leave in conditioner for my hair and this is not it! I have 4b type relaxed hair and I don&#x27;t like the residue feeling of this product. It makes my hair feel sticky and I&#x27;m not sure if thats what it&#x27;s supposed to feel like, but I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It makes my hair softer,with mininun frizz and good volume and it is not heavy at all.I even use it on my dauthers hair and it works perfect.Just be aware that if you have curley hair and want something to define your curles ,maybe its not the product your looking for.</li>
    <li> This product did a fantastic job to my dull, damaged hair! I found it worked better if you apply hair oil after use, to lock in the moisture created, otherwise, my hair dries out after a couple of hours. The delivery was quick and well presented!</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Triple Moisture Silk Touch Leave In Cream does not make my hair silky. My hair only take to it sometimes.The days I wash my hair, the leave in cream makes my hair frizzy and dry. If I use it any other time my hair is fine, but its no better than any other leave in.</li>
    <li> I heard about this on youtube and wanted to try it out.  It smells really good and makes my hair so soft! You only need a little bit. My hair is thin and dry. This helps keep moisture in my hair without weighing it down.  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave-in I have found so far.  I have medium-long thick, wavy, fine hair that needs a little something every day to keep it smooth and tangle free.  I discovered this a few yrs ago and have not found anything better since.  It improved the texture of my hair and I no longer find tons of knots/fly aways at the end of the day.    I have adjusted the amount of product applied as well as the method of application.  I use to use a large \\&quot;blob\\&quot; the size of a quarter every day and apply it to my whole head from the ends to the roots.  Now that my hair is in much better shape, I use a dime-nickel sized \\&quot;blob\\&quot; and only apply it to the ends of my hair every other day.  I found my hair would look greasy at the roots the morning after I used it, so I cut back on how much and where I put it.      Great product for the price.  Hard to find in stores sometimes but Amazon.com is my go-to place for everything!</li>
    <li> One of the best leave-in&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, doesn&#x27;t make me greasy!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Please dont mind the name kevin I used my brother account to order off amazon.Anyway OMG! this is one of the best moisturizers that I have ever used.The reason I gave this product 5 stars is because it smells good,Not heavy,a little goes a long way and because this will give your hair so much moisture! I just used this product and im ready to order more just so I wont run out.I usally use ors(organic root stimulator)moisturizer which is good but I might be putting ors on the back burner for a while because this stuff is great.    My top hair moisturizers #1. Neutrogena triple moisture #2.Organic root stimulator</li>
    <li> Oh my god....I just bought this cream yesterday. My hair was very dry and brittle, I am african american with relaxed hair. I poured a little into my palm,rub it in my hair. It made my hair feel moisturized and soft...I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a thick cream.  seems to detangle nicely.  although i see less flyaways- they&#x27;re not gone completely.  the scent is strong &amp; lasts all day- it&#x27;s not terrible though.</li>
    <li> Good product, pretty much as expected based on the ingredients. My hair is medium lengthy, wavy, coarse and dry. I stopped using sulfate containing shampoos years ago and have recently been using natural shampoo bars as an experiment, which I like. I am trying to simplify my hair care routine to the max. The only thing I have found is that I can&#x27;t use this on or near the crown of my head as it tends to be too much. That would be true of any conditioning type product. Good product overall, but I have not found my holy grail.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, frizz-prone hair, and I rely on this everyday to keep my hair looking good!  It manages to keep my curls defined but not greasy, and they&#x27;re so soft, my boyfriend loves touching my hair, lol.  I LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love it. I have short straight fine hair that is often full of static. Neutrogena triple moisture gave me static free silky hair without weighing it down and making it look oily/dirty.</li>
    <li> This product had it&#x27;s pros and cons! I&#x27;m African American and have relaxed hair. While using this product, it did everything it said it would and I liked that a lot. There&#x27;s a lot of great ingredients and I liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. However, for my hair I like products where a little bit goes a long way and this product wasn&#x27;t that. I had to use a lot at one time and I went through the bottle quicker than I wanted to. So $8 or $9 is ok until you start having to buy this often. Since then I&#x27;ve found another product that softens my hair with double the amount yet at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> this product worked great for my relaxed hair.it left my hair soft and smooth i use this and coconut oil and my hair turns out soft. this works better for my hair than herbal essence long term relationship leave in.</li>
    <li> I love this leave-in cream conditioner! It makes my hair tangle free and smooth. I have used this for a long time. My hair is dry, with the natural curl. Love this stuff! I just hope they keep it affordable....</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of all the rave reviews. I put this in my hair and I did not do much. I have thick and dry hair. I put a decent amount and combed it through my hair. Unfortunately it did not moisturize much! However I will keep it as an emergency moisturizer if I run out of my other stuff!</li>
    <li> I first tried this product because of the reviews and I&#x27;m very glad I did! if you have frizzy ,dry ,curly or unmanageable hair ,this is for you too :)</li>
    <li> Great protection when blow drying and smells awesome!! Would recommend this product to anyone that has issues with dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is great for preventing dog-butt-looking hair on my husband&#x27;s curly head. I mean it gets rid of the dry poof frizzies.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. I use this product everyday as part of my moisture and seal ritual. It goes on very smooth and silky. It very light and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair in its natural state no chemicals at all, so I have to keep my hair moist at all times.  I love how this leave in keeps my hair feeling so moist and soft without being greasy. I have other leave ins some that are very expensive but they are made with Natural ingredients, but this works just as good as they do.  I gave this product 4 stars because I dont care for the scent, all of the conditioners in the \\&quot;Neutrogena Triple Moisture\\&quot; line have the same scent and Im not a fan of it.  Other than the scent this is a great leave in conditioner to me.</li>
    <li> After hearing so many good things about Neutrogena Triple Moisture cream, I finally decided to try it. Well, suffice it to say I threw it out after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturiser did nothing but fragrance my hair (it has a strong fragrance). I tried it as a leave-in, as well as a daily moisturiser. It probably worked better as a daily moisturiser, but it still didn&#x27;t do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this moisturiser, my hair felt coated and felt dry after a couple of hours. Not surprising, since two of the first few ingredients are silicones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used better moisturisers and leave-ins e.g. It&#x27;s a 10, Skala.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this ever again.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see how it works. Its not like a cream, it is very watery. But smells sooo good.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have very thick, very long hair and this leave-in cream works wonders for it.  It makes my hair shiny and smooth, no frizz or flyaways.  The entire Triple Moisture collection is awesome and this product compliments the deep conditioning treatment very well.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this.  I have thin, fine, dry old lady hair with a natural curl that I wash every day.  I have been using &amp;#34;Leave on&amp;#34; by J of Beverly Hills, recommended by the woman who cuts my hair.  the J product did make my hair look and feel better.  The Neutragena Leave in is so much better-- hair softer, silkier, shinier AND it doesn&#x27;t look or feel as thin and fine! !!! Hey, what more can you ask for, at any age?</li>
    <li> Great product.  Too expensive.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream, will buyit again.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Triple Moisture&#x27;s hair product line is one of the best out there. This is to be used on the back end, after using their shampoo, conditioner, and the like. A small dollop and my scalp stays moisturized all day -- good stuff.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and makes hair shine I use it with a hair thickener from Marc Antony called thick and the two make my hair look fuller.</li>
    <li> When it arrived, it was leaking out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;But it smell good and it is an ok product. Not great for my hair but not bad either. I will use the rest of the bottle, not sure if i will purchase again though.</li>
    <li> Amazing also a great everyday moisturizer</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic in a bottle! A tiny bit goes a very long way (pea size) to fix my daughter&#x27;s very long, fine, pool &amp; sun abused hair. For awhile it was hard to find and I woudl go long and far for a bottle. A must for anyone sick of trying to untangle a mess on a grumpy kid&#x27;s head</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my hair journey and trying to find a leave in which keeps my hair moist when blow dried with very low heat. This (in small quantities) has done nothing for me. I don&#x27;t find it good.</li>
    <li> nice product leaves hair shiny, healthy and bouncy. it does help with colored hair. so try it out for it is dermatologicalye tested</li>
    <li> I use this for both my leave in conditioner and when my hair gets a little dry during washes and it needs moisture. It is so light and not greasy at all that you can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> This product is a winner. My hair is dry and frizzy and this leave-in cream gives it adequate moisture and texture without making it greasy. Just a tiny bit and that&#x27;s all it takes. I use it every time after I wash my hair and my once unruly hair is more manageable now.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It leaves my hair really moisturized and it smells great! Also the product is very light weight; it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all</li>
    <li> I liked this product. It works best when I use it after I dried my hair. My hair feels more moistrous and smelling good at the same time. It also helped with the static electricity that I got with the thick clothes in the winter.</li>
    <li> I brought this product because I was trying to get rid of little fly-away hairs and the reviews were really good.  I used it as instructed and I honestly saw no difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been seeing people rave about this on hair forums forever but I never wanted to pay what they were asking for it.  I finally saw it for cheaper and I bought it.  I used it a couple of times as a reg moisturizer on dry hair and it was horrible.  Not bad, not okay, but horrible!  I decided to try it on wet hair as a leave-in before giving up on it and it worked best that way. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again though.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for the past 2-3 years and I will most likely continue using it for years to come! It does everything that it says it will do and more. This product leaves my hair, soft, smooth, and shiny. No matter how much amount I use, I PERSONALLY find that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or makes it feel greasy or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product either as a leave in-conditioner on my wash days or as an everyday moisturizer. It moisturizes my hair strands like no other moisturizer has in years! I only wished that it came in a bigger bottle. Otherwise, highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I have relaxed MBL hair</li>
    <li> i continue to order this product. works so amazingly</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy hair and I thought this product would make my hair soft and take away the frizz.  It does make my hair soft and easy to comb but does nothing for the frizz.</li>
    <li> Works great, my hair feels so soft with just a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I expected so much more from this because of its reviews. However im not impressed. My hair feels the same after using this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been buying like ten at a time because it&#x27;s a hair HG and pemanent staple of mine, and I&#x27;m scared they&#x27;ll stop producing it because I don&#x27;t think many know about it. Wish it came in a bigger size and they had more ads for it. Buy it you&#x27;ll love it. Makes my hair super soft and silky. I usually apply it for regular styling and on my dry hair then roll with up with rollers for soft fluffy curls in the morning.</li>
    <li> not the product itself, just the company that distributes it, not for the customers at all.</li>
    <li> I heard so much about this product that i would give it a try and after usein git for a month it doesnt do anything better for my hair at all . all it does is sit on top of my hair and it doesnt even moistureize it good either. this was a waste of money for me</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about leave-in conditioner, except whether it works or not.  I started using this one when a friend let me borrow it last year.  It not only works well on my hair (course, curly, dry), but it smells wonderful!  I was having a hard time finding it in brick and mortar stores for months, so I ordered it here on Amazon instead.  I probably paid more for it here through a third-party seller with their shipping cost, but my hair is short and doesn&#x27;t require much product.  It arrived when expected and in good condition (no pun intended here).  I would recommend this for anyone with similar hair.  Giving it 5 stars for the quality of product and service.</li>
    <li> works ok, just not as shinier as what I expected but will keep using it until I find another product that&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this wonderful bottle for years and love it. With short hair I just finish up with a spot of this cream and my hair looks great and feels soft and fluffy all day.</li>
    <li> This product works as well as people say it does. excellent for very dry hair. Restores the moisture and life in your hair. My hair is heat and chemically damages, but this product really made a difference after using it only twice. It&#x27;s now part of my routine daily.</li>
    <li> I have searched high and low for this over the years every time I grow my hair out because no local stores carry it.  My hair is fine and relatively straight.  In our northern, dry, cold climate (for most of the year) here in northern Wisconsin, if I don&#x27;t use this, when I brush my hair it stands straight out and sticks to everything, as as though I had my hand on one of those silver ion generating spheres (forgot the technical name for them). This product puts a stop to that with just a few drops worked in when my hair is wet.  Thus a 6 oz bottle lasts for probably close to a year for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores once, I ended up trying about 8 other products, none of which did anything for the static or my hair in general, so I finally bought it online from the only place I could find it, as I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon.  I paid more for the shipping than the product, and it took nearly 2 weeks to get here.  As a Prime member used to free 2-day shipping, that was not ideal.  So I&#x27;m happy to see it on Amazon now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t use too much, put it in when your hair is fairly wet, comb it through, then towel dry more after as needed (tip from the guy who used to cut my hair) and all is well.  If it seems a bit visible when your hair dries, assuming you don&#x27;t blow dry it, then brushing it is all it takes to make that disappear, leaving your hair soft, a bit shiny but not too much, and yet still static free.  So I am happy that this available at a reasonable price on Amazon now, and hope that continues.</li>
    <li> I got this 2 days ago in my mailbox and although I don&#x27;t always write reviews unless I feel compelled to do so. But this product, more than compelled me to write a review! In one word this is - MAGIC! I am serious! No kidding! I have very fine, somewhat between straight and wavy hair (upto my back). Not very volumnous, but long and very fine strands. So I applied it after washing my hair, when they were about damp, and as soon as they dried, my hair was softer and smoother, with ZERO FLY AWAYs! I couldn&#x27;t stop rolling my fingers in my hair and as if that were not enough, it&#x27;s smell is sooo nice and pleasant that there&#x27;s no reason you should not consider buying this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this price, I think it&#x27;s a veryyy good deal! If you&#x27;re looking for a conditioner that would actually leave your hair feeling super nourished, moisturized, and suppppper soft, without being greasy at all, then be informed - THIS IS IT! I swear! Others just claim to meet those ends, but this product actually does what it says! I was kinda skeptical before purchasing this, but after ordering and trying it out myself, I recommend this - 200%! You wont regret your purchase :) :) Btw, my sister loved it sooo much herself, that I had to order one for her as well! :)</li>
    <li> its a good leave in cream, at 1st i thought it was alil thin but after using it it works well, and i only need about the size of a dime, if i use more my hair gets oily and yucky (my hair is about shoulder length )</li>
    <li> I initially found out about NTM on a hair care forum. It was listed as one of the top ten leave in conditioners by the members I was really hesitant to purchase it because I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for my relaxed hair. After researching several leave ins I decided to give this a try since it didn&#x27;t cost that much and it had such great reviews well, I&#x27;m glad I did I love this stuff it leaves my hair feeling really soft, shiny, and light it doesn&#x27;t cause any build up unlike other leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve tried in the past. My only complaint it is pretty small as other reviews have stated I wish I could find this locally to avoid paying shipping cost but I will continue to use this product and I recommend others to give it a try also.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I like that it is leave in and I use it in addition to my rinse out conditioner when washing my hair. I control where it goes on my hair which is mostly at the ends. It make your hair shine, feel silky, and all my friends love it too, It is sometimes hard to find at grocery and drug stores and that is why I bought it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> i love this product!!! i used it on my dry hair and it made it sooooo soft and bouncy!!!!</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Triple Moisture. It saves hair from the worst damage and dryness. My Hair gets extremely dry, frizzy, and tangled with massive breakage, and this makes it really soft, smooth,shiny, and silky. It really improved my hair&#x27;s health.&lt;br /&gt;Triple Moisture is not greasy or oily with gross build up. It spreads through hair really easily and hair gulps it all up really fast.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend Triple Moisture to anyone. I&#x27;ve used this product forever to make hair look and feel great. I regularly use tons of Neutrogena products and I don&#x27;t have a bad thing to say about the brand.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING AND SPENT WAY TOO MUCH MONEY....IT WORKS!  I LOVE THIS STUFF...DOES NOT WEIGH MY FINE HAIR DOWN, CONDITIONS AND LEAVES MY FRIZZY COLOR TREATED  GREY HAIR VERY VERY SILKY.</li>
    <li> Its suits me perfect, I have been using for many years now. I tried a few other brands and  also few other similar products from Neutrogena, but this leave-in moisture cream from Neutrogena is perfect for normal dry hair. This is also quite expensive to buy from a store, bought one for $8.5 from CVS, but on Amazon it just over $3, it cheaper even with shipping costs, but I buy a bundle of six so that shipping cost is spread out and not that much. I strongly recommend this product for men, no need to use conditioner, just shampoo, towel-dry and use this leave-in moisture cream.[[ASIN:B00027CDY2 Neutrogena Triple Moisture Silk Touch Leave-In Cream, 6 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> This is the best product anyone could ask for. Speedy service as well. Did wonders with my hair. Love it</li>
    <li> It smells good, easy applications, conditions my hair beautifully and it lasts a pretty long time since I only need less than a dime size amount when I use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, but have noticed lately that I can get the same results with my normal hair conditioner.... I just don&#x27;t rinse out my regular conditioner completely (when showering)...  I might even add a little more conditioner before stepping out of the shower.  I just leave the normal hair conditioner on my hair...  it coats my hair, and makes less frizz and fly always.  ... and adds texture.  This is not a cheap product at about $7 per small bottle.  I just think you can get the same effect with regular hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast! I like it ! Not as impressive as the conditioner ,but i do like it better then other leave in, who leave your hair greasy or still too dry !</li>
    <li> Great buy. Leaves hair soft and moisturized. Very lightweight. I wish it was easier to find in stores. The bottle is too small especially since I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Amazing! This is definitely one of my drugstore go to leave in creams. I like to use this product on my dry hair to tame frizz and flyaways when I need it! Makes my hair smell great and most importantly so silky and soft! Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> I purchase this at my local drug store and watch for it to go on sale. I came here to write a review because of how amazing this product is. If you are not using a leave in conditioner right no no matter your hair type, thickness, anything buy this product!!! It is a miracle cure.&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly thin, straight, fine, shoulder length hair that I style daily and have always struggled with keeping the ends of my hair from drying out and preventing split ends. I use deep conditioning/moisturizing treatments a few times a week and while those helped this product sealed the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I shower my hair is always matted and tangled, I take a quarter-sized amount of this and rub it between my hands then gently massage it into the ends of my hair. It soaks into your hair instantly so if you have thick hair you will probably need to apply more and you can see the improvement. It does not leave a coating, or worse clump up. Then I take a wide toothed detangler comb and it slides through my hair like melted butter. It takes me just seconds to comb out my hair and I lose very little hair. Before this products I was constantly catch on knots and fighting through them. I have no idea how this product works so magically but it really does. It has also greatly improved the dryness and my split ends adding greatly needed extra moisture. It also has UV protection meaning that it adds a layer of protection to your hair. Amazing! After faithfully using this product for over a year I cannot live without it and now vouch for when my hairstylist is constantly raving about the importance of leave in conditioner. It is an absolute essential, the equivalent of washing your hair or brushing your teeth. No matter your hair type you should use leave in conditioner. Just try it, you will notice a huge improvement in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is also much much better than the spray also by Neutrogena. I did not find the spray to be effective at all.</li>
    <li> im gonna be honest- i did not take care of my hair. i didn&#x27;t get my hair cut often, i didn&#x27;t deep condition ever, i didn&#x27;t use heat protectant, i dried it in all the wrong ways. finally id had enough and decided to revamp it all. i did some research and this product was suggested by a couple different bloggers and it was in my budget, so i ordered some. I&#x27;m so glad i did. i saw difference very early. i started some other treatments for my hair not long after but even this alone helped. i don&#x27;t even have to use a lot. it smells good, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or flat, nor does it fade my curls. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Upon 1st using this product it really moisturized my hair without the hard dry effect after a few minutes. I used this followed by my coconut oil and it works wonders to keep my hair moderately moist all day. I would need to use a good bit to moisturize my hair because of the texture. I would deff buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help my dry hair retain moisture after my wash. So far so good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Product is water based so you&#x27;ll get a creamy (not so thick) element&lt;br /&gt;(2) My 4C hair type reacted instantly, making it easier to finger detangle (my hair tends to tangle even though i dry detangle and wet detangle so this product helped).&lt;br /&gt;(3)  No need to use large amounts ( I use a fair amount that is about the size of two quarters in my neck length hair)&lt;br /&gt;(4)This product was recommended to me in \\&quot;The science of Black Hair\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I also noticed a softer texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;(1) My sister tried it in her relaxed hair and was not pleased.&lt;br /&gt;(2) Smell is not bad but nothing great either&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S&lt;br /&gt;-bottle looks like it will last me about 2 months&lt;br /&gt;- this product does not leave any visible residue in the hair</li>
    <li> It only takes a small amount to soften my thick coarse hair. I like it because you apply to damp hair and leave it in. The right amount does not cause greasiness but too much sure will. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years. I was getting it at a local pharmacy then they stopped selling it in Canada for some reason. I would prefer it to be unscented though the smell is pleasant and is not too strong.</li>
    <li> This a great product I love how it has my hair felling. I keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> This is the only leave in condition that I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t leave your have feeling limp. You only need a dime size amount to work into your hair and it leaves it feeling soft and manageable. I still use my conditioner in the shower but this give me an added layer of protection without weighing the hair down. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair really soft. It&#x27;s also a part of my regimen. You should incorporate this product into hair care. You will feel a big difference. I love it!</li>
    <li> Too translucent for my hair. It eats it right up but I still use it because it still hold true to its description. I just have coarser hair for this. I would get this again but a thicker one.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in using this product.  I had high hopes after reading some of the reviews, but I can&#x27;t say for me that I care for it too much.</li>
    <li> Its very mild scent and it leaves my hair very soft and manageable throughout the day.  I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have very dry and fine hair, but a lot of it. This works wonders on my ends and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or sticky. I also love the soft strawberry smell.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but I don&#x27;t see any affect really on my hair....I don&#x27;t know. It doesn&#x27;t have an adverse reaction to my hair either so I will just continue using the bottle....but after I apply it on damp hair it is easier to de-tangle and has a nice slick feeling to it. So over it&#x27;s ok, not too crazy about it! Well look for a better leave-in..</li>
    <li> I decided to transition 8 months ago and I had been wearing weaves up until then. I had no idea what to put on my real hair anymore, it was dry and brittle and I didnt know what to do. I read some reviews on this and decided to try it out. This product smells amazing and works like a charm. My transitioning hair is softer, smoother and shinier than it has ever been. I normally apply a little water, this moisturizer and olive oil to seal. It&#x27;s not oily which is great becuase i hate greasy weighed down hair, it also smells really good. I bought it on Amazon but later found it in cvs which is great because I&#x27;m already on my second bottle!</li>
    <li> I was blessed with baby fine but thick hair. I can&#x27;t usually use leave-in conditioners because they make my hair extremely oily. I dye my hair regularly which damages it a bit so I decided to do some research to see if there was anything out there that might work on my hair. I FOUND IT. Wow, this stuff is amazing. It makes my hair baby soft without weighing it down and gets rid of all the frizz. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love it. Do not weight my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: It is expensive for such a small content. Harder to find.</li>
    <li> I found this in a store a few years ago and really liked how it helped my hair. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it any more and kind of forgot about it.  Recently when I got my hair cut the hairdresser mentioned how dry my hair was. I decided to search Amazon to see if I could find this product again. My hair is fine but there is a ton of it and it&#x27;s wavy and a little bit frizzy with quite a bit of grey. This product leaves it soft and manageable without being oily or weighed down. (I know, sounds like a commercial but it&#x27;s true). I decided to go ahead and try the Neutrogena Triple Moisture shampoo and conditioner too and I could not be more pleased. Even though it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks, my hair isn&#x27;t dry any more.</li>
    <li> Does much to soothe the savage strands.  Since I have kinky hair, I can take a dab, rub it in the palm of my hands, and apply it to my hair.  A lil dab really will do!</li>
