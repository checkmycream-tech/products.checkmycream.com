      <li>I would like it better if the stickiness did not linger as it does.</li>

      <li>I am not so sure this is the miracle cream they claim it to be.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure results will be seen quicker if used more.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>have been using this for two weeks, and my thighs, abdomen and arms have a noticeably better appearance.  </li>
      <li>I am using it sparingly, so I feel like a more generous application could be used for faster results.  </li>
      <li>Working out and eating healthy, as well as drinking plenty of water helps the skin glow but using this provides assistance to smoother skin.</li>
      <li>can tell that my skin is beginning to look smoother and, with continued use, I am sure that I will see more improvement.</li>
      <li>I feel much better and confident in the appearance of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I got this cream at a special promotion to try it and write my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t quite place the scent, sort of like a very mild mint-like fragrance, not overpowering at all.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the jar first thing I liked is that there is a inside lid to seal it so it won&#x27;t leak.</li>
      <li>This cream is very light and easy to apply; it goes on quickly and smoothly, making it easy to follow the directions and apply in a circular motion.</li>
      <li>I was not required to write a positive review &amp; the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
      <li>It does  help to  refine the look of cellulite, and is a light and fragrant body cream, as well.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin moisturized and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I noticed results within the first week of using it!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used products such as Nivea Good Bye Cellulite and that wasn&#x27;t as sticky.</li>
      <li>The dimples and ripples are much smoother and my skin is firmer and more plumped up.  </li>
      <li>I love trying new products so of course I said yes!</li>
      <li>It absorbs rather quickly &amp; doesn’t feel greasy or sticky.</li>
      <li>with all of the other amazing ingredients, you have a powerhouse combatant of cellulite and sagging skin!  </li>
      <li>Hopefully thrilled enough to remember to use it twice a day, but thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
      <li>living in Hawaii they way my skin looks is a big deal to me since is summertime most of the year here.</li>
      <li>This is not necessary, since it is a thinner consistency than most of the lotions and creams I am used to.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
      <li>I just finished my first jar.</li>
      <li>When I removed the lid there was a pull top to keep the cream air tight and fresh.</li>
      <li>Rosehip oil is very moisturizing</li>
      <li>&amp; I know that when Summer arrives, I’ll be ready for shorts!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It seems to tighten the skin, but is very sticky upon application.</li>
      <li>It smells alot better than  the other creams I tried, that did NOT work!</li>
      <li>So, after only a week or so of using it twice daily (most days-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The formula has a familiar peppermint scent that strangely reminds me of Andes Mint Chocolates!</li>
      <li>I see some people who say they are seeing immediate results, but no cream is a magic elixir that will make cellulite disappear in just a few uses.</li>
      <li>I smoothed the cream into the recommended areas and it absorbs pretty quickly and leaves a light scent behind.</li>
      <li>I apply this with a cellulite brush right after I get out of the shower, while my pores are still open.  </li>
      <li>I received an email asking if I would like to review a cellulite cream for OzShape&#x27;s new product launch.</li>
      <li>I would probably see better results if I could remember to use it the prescribed amount, but I&#x27;m senile and only remember about every other day!</li>
      <li>&amp; I have somewhat sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I had to wait at least 10 or more minutes after applying it before getting dressed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>While this is marketed as a treatment for cellulite, it is also quite useful for other skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would first use the brushing technique (you can do a Google search on that) for a couple of minutes followed by a deep tissue message using the OZ shape cellulite cream into my problem areas for another couple of minutes, and there is a definite improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OZ shape cellulite cream smells like mint chocolate chip ice cream to me.</li>
      <li>I love that this product uses organic ingredients and has no parabens, which are not good for you</li>
      <li>The recipe is non-irritating and feels cool for a few minutes when applied.</li>
      <li>I apply it twice every day to several areas &amp; I always make sure that I massage it into my skin for at least a couple of minutes.</li>
      <li>I just started using this product so only alittle results so far.</li>
      <li>My cream was shipped quickly and comes in a plain white jar with a white sticker label that lists the product information including; name, size, MADE IN USA, directions, warnings, and ingredients.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received an email asking if I would like to review a cellulite cream for OzShape&#x27;s new product launch. I love trying new products so of course I said yes! My cream was shipped quickly and comes in a plain white jar with a white sticker label that lists the product information including; name, size, MADE IN USA, directions, warnings, and ingredients. When I removed the lid there was a pull top to keep the cream air tight and fresh. The cellulite cream is an off-white color and thin gel-like consistency. The formula has a familiar peppermint scent that strangely reminds me of Andes Mint Chocolates! I smoothed the cream into the recommended areas and it absorbs pretty quickly and leaves a light scent behind. Goes on like a serum, I like that there is no texture (greasy) feeling so I can follow up with my regular moisturizer. I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product only once a day after I shower but the suggested use is twice a day. I&#x27;m sure results will be seen quicker if used more. The recipe is non-irritating and feels cool for a few minutes when applied. As with any serum, cream or lotion, it takes time to see the effects. I like the size of the jar because I feel like it gives enough product to see change. Working out and eating healthy, as well as drinking plenty of water helps the skin glow but using this provides assistance to smoother skin.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST cream!!! I had results within 3 days! I already ordered 2 more jars, dont want to run out!. In some of the reviews they mentioned that they didnt care for the scent of the cream?  It smells alot better than  the other creams I tried, that did NOT work!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the OZ Shape cream for three days and there is a noticeable difference in my hip and thigh area.</li>
    <li> I am not so sure this is the miracle cream they claim it to be. I workout regularly too and have not seen results. :(</li>
    <li> WORKS!! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I have tried several different cellulite creams in the past, with little, to no results.  I have been using OZ Shape Cellulite Gel-Cream daily, for two weeks.  Since I recently turned 40, I decided to ramp up my anti-aging and skin care regimens.  I have very little cellulite, but I do have a bit of ripply, sagging skin on my abdomen and inner thighs from losing weight.  While this is marketed as a treatment for cellulite, it is also quite useful for other skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we age, collagen production slows down and our skin becomes thin and loses elasticity.  Retinol is widely known to increase collagen production.  When you combine that with all of the other amazing ingredients, you have a powerhouse combatant of cellulite and sagging skin!  The caffeine and guarana penetrate the skin and make it firmer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for two weeks, and my thighs, abdomen and arms have a noticeably better appearance.  The dimples and ripples are much smoother and my skin is firmer and more plumped up.  I apply this with a cellulite brush right after I get out of the shower, while my pores are still open.  The gel-cream also contains rosehip oil and I am a lover of essential oils.  I actually use about 25% of my rosehip oil and 75% of this.  This is not necessary, since it is a thinner consistency than most of the lotions and creams I am used to.  Rosehip oil is very moisturizing and I like the results I get using the combination.  This is proudly made in the USA.  I am very pleased with the results of this product.  I am using it sparingly, so I feel like a more generous application could be used for faster results.  I feel much better and confident in the appearance of my skin.  I am so glad I was able to test this product, at no cost, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and review.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad and it&#x27;s easy to apply.  It&#x27;s a bit greasy so I apply it at night.  I think I notice a difference after a week of using it.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first jar. After applying the cream twice a day on my hips and butt, I&#x27;ve seen no improvement whatsoever. The cream is thick and tacky so I had to wait at least 10 or more minutes after applying it before getting dressed.&lt;br /&gt;It may work for others but not for me. If I could get my money back I would!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product so only alittle results so far. What I don&#x27;t like is the smell and the tingling burning feeling you get. However if that means it&#x27;s working by all means tingle away.</li>
    <li> This is not a miracle cream but, I do see instant results in the appearance of my skin as soon as I massage this cream onto my Cellulite areas.  The product smells and feels good.  Leaves my skin moisturized and smooth.  With daily use, diet and exercise you will change the appearance of your skin.  I love that this product uses organic ingredients and has no parabens, which are not good for you skin.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> living in Hawaii they way my skin looks is a big deal to me since is summertime most of the year here. I got this cream at a special promotion to try it and write my honest opinion. When I opened the jar first thing I liked is that there is a inside lid to seal it so it won&#x27;t leak. The cream is a gel base and applies really quickly and have a hint of citrus smell in it.takes a little bit to dry completely but gives a refreshing feeling to the skin. y sking feels to say the least softer and smoother on my legs an buttocks after a few weeks using it daily. I want to say the retinol is a plus and I a, very happy with it. I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! I noticed results within the first week of using it!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It does  help to  refine the look of cellulite, and is a light and fragrant body cream, as well.</li>
    <li> Before this I never believed that cellulite creams could possibly work. I have always been frustrated that no matter how in shape I get, there is always this little bit of cellulite that just never goes away. I received this cream for quality evaluation and have been using this product for about 2 weeks. I can see it’s slowly helping. I only use it during the day, putting it on my stomach, legs and upper arms after my morning shower and massaging it in for a minute or so. This cream is very light and easy to apply; it goes on quickly and smoothly, making it easy to follow the directions and apply in a circular motion. Once it soaks in, it does feel slightly tacky to the touch, but that is a small thing compared to the benefits and doesn&#x27;t bother me. So, after only a week or so of using it twice daily (most days- I forgot in the morning a couple of times), I had already noticed the skin on my stomach looking smoother! It took a little longer for my thighs and behind, but there is more work to do there.  I can&#x27;t quite place the scent, sort of like a very mild mint-like fragrance, not overpowering at all.  So, I will continue to use it, regardless of how long it takes. This stuff does actually work and with consistency, I can get to where I want to be. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.. My review is based on my experience with the product which may differ from yours</li>
    <li> I have noticed a change in the amount of dimples on my hiney and thighs while using this product. I would probably see better results if I could remember to use it the prescribed amount, but I&#x27;m senile and only remember about every other day! I have been using this everyday at best, every other day at worst. I would first use the brushing technique (you can do a Google search on that) for a couple of minutes followed by a deep tissue message using the OZ shape cellulite cream into my problem areas for another couple of minutes, and there is a definite improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OZ shape cellulite cream smells like mint chocolate chip ice cream to me. That&#x27;s the scent I have associated with this cream and I like it. I have only been using this product on my worst side and it&#x27;s now even with the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; side. I am thrilled. Hopefully thrilled enough to remember to use it twice a day, but thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item received in exchange for review. All reviews, whether self-purchased or provided for review, will be completely honest.</li>
    <li> Its ok. I&#x27;m not certain its 3 or 4 stars since I&#x27;ve only started using it (about 2 weeks now). It seems to tighten the skin, but is very sticky upon application. I would like it better if the stickiness did not linger as it does. I&#x27;ve used products such as Nivea Good Bye Cellulite and that wasn&#x27;t as sticky. I&#x27;ll give it a 4 for the customer service, but not sure I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oz Shape Cellulite Cream for about 2 weeks now. I apply it twice every day to several areas &amp; I always make sure that I massage it into my skin for at least a couple of minutes. It has a nice cooling feeling while I’m applying it &amp; a bit of a tingling or tightening afterwards. I like that because that tells me that something is happening!&lt;br /&gt;This cream goes on very smoothly &amp; has a nice minty scent that is not overpowering. It absorbs rather quickly &amp; doesn’t feel greasy or sticky. I have not had any irritation or redness at all &amp; I have somewhat sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell that my skin is beginning to look smoother and, with continued use, I am sure that I will see more improvement. I see some people who say they are seeing immediate results, but no cream is a magic elixir that will make cellulite disappear in just a few uses. But this one has great promise &amp; I know that when Summer arrives, I’ll be ready for shorts!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I was not required to write a positive review &amp; the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product!!!! I&#x27;d highly recommend. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
