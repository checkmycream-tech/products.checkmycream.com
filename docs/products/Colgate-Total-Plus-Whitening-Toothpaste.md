### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This toothpaste fits in perfectly.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect toothpaste for whitening.</li>
      <li>You get the best bang for your buck when purchasing in bulk, everyone knows that.</li>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>I say this is the best toothpaste because is gel</li>
      <li>The taste is great, the freshness in your mouth when finished brushing is wonderful.   </li>
      <li>/&gt;Stepping where I dared step, to swipe, then deliver the ripest, rarest grapes from Mr. Schesta&#x27;s vines, I enjoyed the perfect crime.</li>
      <li>Nancy, never nonplussed, smiled, and took me to the washroom to see that all would be well.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste cleans your teeth good but it is way too strong and causes me to get canker sores in my mouth.</li>
      <li>Okay so this is a fairly good toothpaste, no bad taste and cleans my teeth</li>
      <li>For more information on triclosan, refer to the EPA website.</li>
      <li>is a better toothpaste that does everything colgate claims to do</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>When using Crest, I&#x27;m confident that it will remove the scent of garlic, but with Colgate, I&#x27;m always concerned that my breath still smells</li>
      <li>, THIS IS NOT A WHITENING TREATMENT, so don&#x27;t expect an outstanding change.</li>
      <li>Please educate yourselves on the chemical \\&quot;Triclosan\\&quot; found in this product and many others.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I tend to eat a lot of potent foods, so perhaps this is why Colgate just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>It also cleans my teeth very nicely and makes my mouth feel clean, and fresh.</li>
      <li>Either way, it&#x27;s not as strong as Crest and it surely doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
      <li>Might want to add 1/4 of some cheap gel toothpaste to get better brushing consistency with full head toothbrushes.    </li>
      <li>\\&quot;These will be better than the first batch,\\&quot; he said, then sitting with us, while we three talked more about oranges.</li>
      <li>My teeth are clean, but so are my shoes.</li>
      <li>I went right to the store and started using it, after 2 days I had 5 canker sores!</li>
      <li>It tastes good, but after starting to use this I got my first cavity ever.</li>
      <li>When I bought this, my roommates made fun of me.</li>
      <li>, I can feel it cleans better than the regular paste, then is of the Total 12 hour protection line, its flavor is amazing, really cool and with</li>
      <li>A quick rinse, then the smallest amount of toothpaste on a new brush (I would take no chances), my shoes were soon wiped clean, whiter than when the morning began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is certainly not a plus for a woman who&#x27;s husband attends culinary classes and cooks some incredible meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No shoe&#x27;s tongue would taste the cool mint, though its clever scent tickled the air.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have been an avid Crest user for most of my life, for no particular reason except for the fact that Crest was what we had in the house.</li>
      <li>Also love the clean tube top (which is basically funnels the toothpaste from the tube to an opening rather than having an abrupt end that gets messy).</li>
      <li>but it really has the consistency of a paste.  </li>
      <li>I really like this one.</li>
      <li>I actually still haven&#x27;t even gone through the first tube of toothpaste!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that Colgate&#x27;s isn&#x27;t as strong as other oral care products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Then you have 6 useless tubes of paste that you can try to sell to your friends, or give them away as gifts (great for stocking stuffing!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Generally I only buy this by mistake or because it&#x27;s cheaper than the paste (which is often the case because it&#x27;s less popular and ends up in the clearance aisle and some wholesaler stores).      </li>
      <li>The price is just right too as these are the larger tubes of toothpaste!</li>
      <li>why would someone need 6 boxes of the same toothpaste if they havent even tried the first one?...</li>
      <li>NATURAL no chemical ingredients</li>
      <li>its whitening ingredients help to keep your teeth on its natural color</li>
      <li>Overall I really like this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Works well w/o all those little crystals that are sometimes found in others and makes and keeps mouth feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>I also use a Sonicare toothbrush which only enhances the whitening/plaque destroying results! :-)</li>
      <li>Colgate leaves this unfavorable grainy feeling in my mouth that I&#x27;m not sure anyone would enjoy.</li>
      <li>The canker sores went away almost immediately with no other treatment.   </li>
      <li>Really worth it if you buy small tubes frequently.</li>
      <li>It feels similar to what happens when you eat something really hot or too much sour fruit.</li>

<li> /&gt;this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t taste bad or leave a gross taste in your mouth, I have brushed my teeth and drank orange juice directly afterwords without dying.</li>
<li> So if you are having trouble with canker sores look at the ingredient label of your standard toothpaste and if it contains SLS, switch for a few days and see what happens!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m actually pretty disappointed in the EPA and the ADA for not coming down on this as hard as scientists have and even more disappointed in Colgate for even risking it for profit.</li>
<li> Over the past few months, it has started to burn the inside of my mouth.</li>
<li> So now, when they trudge through the cold to go pick up their new tube of toothpaste, I just pull mine out from my drawers.</li>
<li> Not only is it bad for people, but you spit it down the sink and it gets into the water supply and harms the ecosystem.</li>
<li> so my gums got even worse from this toothpaste...</li>
<li> Throwing this out and looking for another brand that is not so harsh and causes painful mouth sores.</li>
<li> I bought this toothpaste and was shocked when I got home and read the ingredient list.</li>

    <li> I brush with Colgate. My teeth are clean, but so are my shoes. They have been since I was six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glistened, moist Colgate&#x27;s toothpaste slipped across my shoe. No shoe&#x27;s tongue would taste the cool mint, though its clever scent tickled the air. My shoe was stained, it seemed, from the juice of fallen grapes stepped upon while wooing Nancy&#x27;s summer affections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stepping where I dared step, to swipe, then deliver the ripest, rarest grapes from Mr. Schesta&#x27;s vines, I enjoyed the perfect crime. His garden was well-known around the block, and his grapes were delicacies. The sun pierced the morning&#x27;s pleasure, and, I, an able-bodied six year-old, knew in Mr. Schesta&#x27;s garden grew the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting on the sidewalk, sucking on the purple fruit, I saw with horror lines of color on my once white shoes. Nancy, never nonplussed, smiled, and took me to the washroom to see that all would be well. A quick rinse, then the smallest amount of toothpaste on a new brush (I would take no chances), my shoes were soon wiped clean, whiter than when the morning began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy and I sat, and talked about oranges, until Mr. Schesta himself walked across the street. With three bags, and a grin, he handed us each a batch of grapes. \\&quot;These will be better than the first batch,\\&quot; he said, then sitting with us, while we three talked more about oranges. He likes Valencias, I learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When in a jam, and grape juice threatens your summer, try Colgate toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Brockeim</li>
    <li> After looking like a nutcase and standing in the oral care aisle for an hour trying to figure out which toothpaste to buy, I settled on Colgate Total Whitening because of the low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Colgate does the job, it just doesn&#x27;t make my mouth feel as refreshed as Crest products. Colgate leaves this unfavorable grainy feeling in my mouth that I&#x27;m not sure anyone would enjoy. Another downside is that even after waiting 30 minutes to eat or drink, everything tastes strange afterward. This is certainly not a plus for a woman who&#x27;s husband attends culinary classes and cooks some incredible meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that Colgate&#x27;s isn&#x27;t as strong as other oral care products I&#x27;ve tried. When using Crest, I&#x27;m confident that it will remove the scent of garlic, but with Colgate, I&#x27;m always concerned that my breath still smells I&#x27;m trying to ward off a vampire. Again, NOT favorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to eat a lot of potent foods, so perhaps this is why Colgate just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Either way, it&#x27;s not as strong as Crest and it surely doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, it works.  I&#x27;ve used it on my kids.  Only recently did I find out that is contained Triclosan.  I&#x27;ve been phasing it out of anti-bacterial soaps and everything else I buy.  I couldn&#x27;t believe my toothpaste contained it. You can research it yourself on line.  It is what adheres to your gums along with another ingredient to give you that 12 hour protection. It&#x27;s not worth the upped pesticide levels and carcinogens in my child as far as I am concerned.  I&#x27;m actually pretty disappointed in the EPA and the ADA for not coming down on this as hard as scientists have and even more disappointed in Colgate for even risking it for profit.</li>
    <li> Okay so this is a fairly good toothpaste, no bad taste and cleans my teeth like I need it to.  The price is just right too as these are the larger tubes of toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using different formulations of Colagte Total for years now. I recently bought Colgate Total Whitening Gel. I really like this one. Unlike some of the other whitening formulations which contain a grit (hard on the gums after awhile), this one has no grit and yet after just a few uses I was sincerely amazed at how white my teeth became. And the same 12-hour gingivitis-fighter Triclosan is still one of the ingredients. I also use a Sonicare toothbrush which only enhances the whitening/plaque destroying results! :-)</li>
    <li> I purchased the 6 pack about a year ago and only on the 4th tube. You get the best bang for your buck when purchasing in bulk, everyone knows that. But you always have to be careful, because what if you don&#x27;t like the product? Then you have 6 useless tubes of paste that you can try to sell to your friends, or give them away as gifts (great for stocking stuffing!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t taste bad or leave a gross taste in your mouth, I have brushed my teeth and drank orange juice directly afterwords without dying. Truly a marvel to ponder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line... Buy this toothpaste, its AWESUME</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.  Works well w/o all those little crystals that are sometimes found in others and makes and keeps mouth feeling clean.  Also love the clean tube top (which is basically funnels the toothpaste from the tube to an opening rather than having an abrupt end that gets messy).</li>
    <li> 6 Pack of the Maga Size! Had to buy it, shouldn&#x27;t need any for a long time. I like the taste as well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I like to whiten my teeth. This is the perfect toothpaste for whitening. It also cleans my teeth very nicely and makes my mouth feel clean, and fresh. Overall I really like this toothpaste. My morning brushing routine includes Flossing, Brushing, and Mouthwashing. This toothpaste fits in perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste and was shocked when I got home and read the ingredient list. The active ingredient is triclosan. Triclosan is currently being investigated by the FDA. It is also under review by the EPA who is considereing banning it. It is already banned in Europe and Canada. In short, it&#x27;s an endocrine system disruptor. It alters hormone regulation. It also contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Not only is it bad for people, but you spit it down the sink and it gets into the water supply and harms the ecosystem. Google it. This is not stuff you want to put in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most toothpastes do not contain triclosan.  Even regular Colgate does not have it, but Colgate Total does.</li>
    <li> I have been an avid Crest user for most of my life, for no particular reason except for the fact that Crest was what we had in the house. I went to the dentist about a month ago and they recommended Crest Total because it contains Triclosan which helps with gum health. I went right to the store and started using it, after 2 days I had 5 canker sores! My fiance also used it and the same thing happened to him, multiple canker sores within a couple days of use. I stopped using Colgate and switched back to Crest. The canker sores went away almost immediately with no other treatment.   I now know why that is what we always had in my house! I did some research and it turns out that one of the ingredients in Colgate Total is Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which has been shown to cause canker sores. So if you are having trouble with canker sores look at the ingredient label of your standard toothpaste and if it contains SLS, switch for a few days and see what happens!  Learned my lesson and will never buy Colgate again!!</li>
    <li> I bought the 6-pack of 7.8oz, just for me, over 8 months ago, and 2 tubes still remaining at rate of 3 brushes daily. Really worth it if you buy small tubes frequently. I say this is the best toothpaste because is gel, I can feel it cleans better than the regular paste, then is of the Total 12 hour protection line, its flavor is amazing, really cool and with its whitening ingredients help to keep your teeth on its natural color, THIS IS NOT A WHITENING TREATMENT, so don&#x27;t expect an outstanding change. And of course, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used Colgate Total for years.  The taste is great, the freshness in your mouth when finished brushing is wonderful.   Great product!  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over a year now. Over the past few months, it has started to burn the inside of my mouth. It feels similar to what happens when you eat something really hot or too much sour fruit. I found quite a few other people online that have similar problems.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste cleans your teeth good but it is way too strong and causes me to get canker sores in my mouth. Throwing this out and looking for another brand that is not so harsh and causes painful mouth sores.</li>
    <li> why would someone need 6 boxes of the same toothpaste if they havent even tried the first one?...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways let me just say that this toothpaste does not do the things it claims it does...Anti gingivitis? yeah i dont think so my gums got even worse from this toothpaste...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wouldnt recommend this to any one for one it contains Triclosan which is cancer cell productive..as reported by the ADA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is a better toothpaste that does everything colgate claims to do but does it better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Tom&#x27;s of maine\\&quot; fluoride-free and Anti-plaque and whitening toothpaste stops gingivitis removes cavities and destroys plaque and reduces tartar buildup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL NATURAL no chemical ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;beat that colgate or crest.</li>
    <li> This is marketed as a gel but it really has the consistency of a paste.  It does the same thing as the total paste there&#x27;s just something strange about the gel that I don&#x27;t like but you might.  Generally I only buy this by mistake or because it&#x27;s cheaper than the paste (which is often the case because it&#x27;s less popular and ends up in the clearance aisle and some wholesaler stores).      Might want to add 1/4 of some cheap gel toothpaste to get better brushing consistency with full head toothbrushes.    SHINY PACKAGE!  SHINY PACKAGE!</li>
    <li> When I bought this, my roommates made fun of me. They thought that I could&#x27;ve gone to CVS or Costco and bought the pack. Are you kidding me? This was even bigger than the one I could&#x27;ve gotten at CVS or Costco! So now, when they trudge through the cold to go pick up their new tube of toothpaste, I just pull mine out from my drawers. I actually still haven&#x27;t even gone through the first tube of toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Please educate yourselves on the chemical \\&quot;Triclosan\\&quot; found in this product and many others. Triclosan is a known endocrine disruptor and is considered toxic. This chemical is currently being considered for ban in the U.S. and is banned in several other countries. It may work, but you have no idea what it is doing to your body and it is harmful to the environment. Some healthier alternatives would be Australian tea tree oil, grapefruit seed extract, and pine oil. For more information on triclosan, refer to the EPA website.</li>
    <li> It tastes good, but after starting to use this I got my first cavity ever. Before I used toothpaste with no fluoride and never had any problems with my teeth.</li>
    <li> I hope I will be buy next time.</li>
