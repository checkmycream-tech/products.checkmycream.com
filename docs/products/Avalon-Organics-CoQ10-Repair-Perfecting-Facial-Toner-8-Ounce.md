      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This toner is amazing.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell</li>
      <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>Love that it has no alcohol.</li>
      <li>I love the cleanser and night/day creams.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Some love it -</li>
      <li>I have noticed my skin having more of a glow than before.</li>
      <li>Love that it removes dirt even after I have washed my face.</li>
      <li>Best product ever - can only get it online.</li>
      <li>It dont bother me the smell and my skin tone is much better its reduced my wrinkle.</li>
      <li>but I love this one.</li>
      <li>Although, it hasn&#x27;t done anything for the darkness under my eyes as I had hoped,  I did notice the fine lines in my forehead didn&#x27;t seem &amp;#34;as&amp;#34; visible.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it is loaded with healing skin nutrients and is toxin free.  </li>
      <li>This company also carries a heavier night cream in the jar that I also enjoy using.</li>
      <li>Some enjoy the tingling sensation and others claimed it burned like acid.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>This product is awesome and will never to back to my old toners.</li>
      <li>This toner is gentle and has a very light fragrance.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if Amazon had noted that the product contained gluten, which I, and many other, are allergic to.</li>
      <li>It cleans away any remaining dirt in the pores and leaves your skin feeling fresh and tightened.</li>
      <li>some saw improvements over a duration, and some saw their skin condition worsen and had to discontinued use right away.</li>
      <li>My face still feels burning hot after 2 days.  </li>
      <li>I have tried Perlabella in the past and had better results, not to mention it applies smooth as silk and feels gentler on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I very highly recommend all Avalon Organics, including this toner.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m saving much money with these products.</li>
      <li>This is gentle yet thorough.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Lancome and Clinique and so many other brands for toner</li>
      <li>AND it&#x27;s so much more affordable than other toners....</li>
      <li>Is it supposed to be organic or highly chemical?????  </li>
      <li>With such conflicting responses, I decided to take the gamble and gave this product a try (after all, it&#x27;s got the magical q10 in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, upon first try, my entire face and nose turned lobster red and it did have a burning feeling.</li>
      <li>Makes my face hot and red for about 15 minutes</li>
      <li>Please note that by the time this review is written, amazon hasn&#x27;t update the image yet, the image is of the old formular, the product amazon is selling IS the NEW formular.</li>
      <li>I started using this toner 5 years ago and it has helped my face stay toned and clear without irritation.</li>
      <li>No reactions from my uber sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My forearms were getting wrinkled and old looking.</li>
      <li>It foams up and is not as hydrating as the old formular</li>
      <li>and I mean a &amp;#34;tad.&amp;#34; My Rosacea redness isn&#x27;t as prominent, but it&#x27;s still there, so this is by no means a cure for Rosacea.</li>
      <li>It really made me mad that the full ingredients weren&#x27;t listed, even though it appeared to be a full list.</li>
      <li>Personally I dislike the new formular.</li>
      <li>and I know this is a new line of toner - relatively so ...</li>
      <li>Is not oily at all and also does not dry my skin out.</li>
      <li>I never experienced this kind of skin reaction when I used other toners/facial products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best product ever - can only get it online.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It dont bother me the smell and my skin tone is much better its reduced my wrinkle. I will recommend it.</li>
    <li> It would be nice if Amazon had noted that the product contained gluten, which I, and many other, are allergic to. It really made me mad that the full ingredients weren&#x27;t listed, even though it appeared to be a full list. My skin turned blotchy and the product has a nasty smell.</li>
    <li> It has a lot of alcohol.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avalon Organics for a while and I know this is a new line of toner - relatively so ... but I love this one. I&#x27;ve used Lancome and Clinique and so many other brands for toner this one is great but I have a small spray bottle and I pour it into that and use it that way and plus I can take that one on my travels when I don&#x27;t check in luggage. It has a nice smell AND it&#x27;s so much more affordable than other toners.... No reactions from my uber sensitive skin. Have used these products a long time and I very highly recommend all Avalon Organics, including this toner.</li>
    <li> This toner is great! I have been using it for over 3 months now. I purchased it on [...]  ($8.99 for 8oz). This toner is gentle and has a very light fragrance. I have noticed my skin having more of a glow than before. Is not oily at all and also does not dry my skin out. This product is awesome and will never to back to my old toners.</li>
    <li> Used this for years.  People guess my age as low as 47. I&#x27;m 63.5.</li>
    <li> My forearms were getting wrinkled and old looking. I bought this and used it on one arm. Within two weeks there was a noticeable difference. I have been using this for a month, and my arms look ten years younger. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it is loaded with healing skin nutrients and is toxin free.  It cleans away any remaining dirt in the pores and leaves your skin feeling fresh and tightened.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on this product here at Amazon and on other websites and the reviews are rather conflicting. Some love it - Some hate it. Some women saw great immediate results...some saw improvements over a duration, and some saw their skin condition worsen and had to discontinued use right away. Some love the smell and others say it stinks. Some enjoy the tingling sensation and others claimed it burned like acid. With such conflicting responses, I decided to take the gamble and gave this product a try (after all, it&#x27;s got the magical q10 in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, upon first try, my entire face and nose turned lobster red and it did have a burning feeling. It took about ten minutes for my red face to fade. Since the redness was temporary and the burning was tolerable, I decided to continue with the product. My skin reacted less and less when I applied it (twice a day am/pm). Ironically, when I decided to use this product I was in the middle of battling an issue with breakouts (pimples).This product actually did help with clearing my breakout. I also have a little Rosacea and it helped a tad and I mean a &amp;#34;tad.&amp;#34; My Rosacea redness isn&#x27;t as prominent, but it&#x27;s still there, so this is by no means a cure for Rosacea. Although, it hasn&#x27;t done anything for the darkness under my eyes as I had hoped,  I did notice the fine lines in my forehead didn&#x27;t seem &amp;#34;as&amp;#34; visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, personally, I didn&#x27;t see enough of an improvement to buy this product again. I have tried Perlabella in the past and had better results, not to mention it applies smooth as silk and feels gentler on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results of this product depends solely on your skin type. So it&#x27;s up to you to take the gamble and try it. Afterwards, you may love it or hate it or like me...think it&#x27;s alright. Good luck.</li>
    <li> This toner is amazing. You won&#x27;t believe after using your regular face wash then using this toner. So much make up is left behind and you can feel your tightening up. LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this product! Highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is gentle yet thorough. It has a little smell to it, but no alcohol. I love the cleanser and night/day creams. This company also carries a heavier night cream in the jar that I also enjoy using. They work just as well, if not better than Lancome, which I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  I&#x27;m saving much money with these products.</li>
    <li> Makes my face hot and red for about 15 minutes but I do like it.</li>
    <li> Perfect toner for my skin, been using for years!</li>

    <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin. I started using this toner 5 years ago and it has helped my face stay toned and clear without irritation.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, helps your complexion and skin tone. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Just what I asked for.  Does a good job.</li>
    <li> I love this! Love that it has no alcohol. Love the smell. Love that it removes dirt even after I have washed my face. Love it!</li>
    <li> I applied it to my face and my face turned really red.  My face still feels burning hot after 2 days.  Is it supposed to be organic or highly chemical?????  I never experienced this kind of skin reaction when I used other toners/facial products.</li>
