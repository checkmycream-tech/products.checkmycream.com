### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This device is good for what it is, but must I keep replacing them!!</li>
      <li>Im extremely happy for this purchase!!!</li>
      <li>It fits incredible good on my blower!!!</li>
      <li>Just the perfect attachment for my blow dryer, and great price.</li>
      <li>Great addition to a Conar hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Great for straitening hair and also for shaping.</li>
      <li>This fit my blow dryer good but the teeth in the pic breaks very easy.  </li>
      <li>Worth it for a great price.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if Conair created a comb with thicker teeth made of more flexible plastic.</li>
      <li>Hello Everyone,  I bought this item because I purchased a Conair hair dryer (after my hair dryer blew up after many years of usage) that came with no comb attachment.</li>
      <li>I own a conair hand held blow dryer but trust me it doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
      <li>Keep having to buy these as the teeth break so easily after about 6 months</li>
      <li>The teeth on this have a bit of flexibility and do not break as easily like the cheaper ones.</li>
      <li>This comb only lasted about 2 weeks after it scratched my beautiful Paul Mitchell dryer, began to melt, fall apart and the teeth broke.</li>
      <li>Works great on my multi-cultural hair, but the only flaw was it didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Supposed to fit in any con air , but won&#x27;t  fit in mine.</li>
      <li>I have a 1875W Conair dryer, so I assumed that it would fit, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This attachment did fit my Conair Blackbird hairdryer, but came apart when i used it.  </li>
      <li>I carefully taped it on and it works just as good!</li>
      <li>I hot glued it to the top of my dryer.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Infiniti by Conair (223NP), 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic 2-in-1 Styler (hair dryer) along with this product as I wanted to make sure that I used the same brand to avoid issues with the pic not being able to attach to the hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>It melted right away and pieces started breaking off in my hair before I noticed.</li>
      <li>This comb got way to hot, popped off the end of the blow dryer and the teeth broke on first use!</li>
      <li>I ordered this pic because I needed to be able to pick and dry my hair quickly in the morning.</li>
      <li>started breaking off during my first use.</li>
      <li>I think that these companies could produce higher quality attachments</li>
      <li>broke off after the first use.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done, but it overheats pretty fast since the dryer isn&#x27;t inserted in the pic.</li>
      <li>My other dry had a great attachment</li>
      <li>The description says universal fit, but it isn&#x27;t really.</li>
      <li>My blowdryer is a Conair, so when it said that it was a universal fit, I wasn&#x27;t worried.  </li>
      <li>This Conair Pro dryer pick straightens curly hair very well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to return it since I needed on ASAP, so</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t fit my dryer and several of the teeth</li>
      <li>This attachment is NOT a universal fit for all blow dryers.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t hold on for long and breaks easily</li>
      <li>The delivery was quick and the product received is definitely durable.</li>
      <li>This one worked great but only for a limited amount of time before almost half of the picks broke off.</li>
      <li>but they want you to spend money on new ones.</li>
      <li>The only reason I rate it 3 stars is because it is one of only a couple on Amazon that fit my blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I got this for Christmas and tried to use it with my old hairdryer and new one (both Conair).</li>
      <li>The pic came and lo and behold, it is NOT a universal fit and this Conair Straightening Pic does not fit my Conair hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>and I an African American with natural hair.</li>
      <li>Worth the few extra dollars.</li>
      <li>After using it a few times and the comb gets hot</li>
      <li>Unfortunately doesn&#x27;t fit the conair dryer well, so I use hospital tape on the dryer to hold the comb on while I blow dry my hair, so it kinda sucks for that, but the comb itself is okay.</li>

<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> did not fit either</li>
<li> One size does not fit all!</li>
<li> Or if you are like me who has a clumsy husband who walks like a drunken sailor, a bruise too.</li>
<li> I replace this at least 2-3x a year.</li>
<li> The thin hard plastic breaks your hair and the teeth</li>
<li> So I purchased this and none of the teeth have broken (yet).</li>
<li> the teeth will start to fall out until it&#x27;s useless.</li>
<li> This makes replacing them very inconvenient.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed with this purchase.</li>

    <li> This straightening comb was not what I expected. I was very disappointed with this purchase. It melted right away and pieces started breaking off in my hair before I noticed. I had melted plastic in my hair! It also damaged my actual blow dryer somehow.</li>
    <li> Worth it for a great price. The delivery was quick and the product received is definitely durable. I would recommend this product makes blow drying my hair by myself a lot easier</li>
    <li> If I could rate this with no stars I would. I have used this item maybe 20 times (I use this attachment for only half of my total drying time) and I only have half of the teeth left. The thin hard plastic breaks your hair and the teeth started breaking off during my first use. If you do get this, save the box for travel so you won&#x27;t lose additional teeth. And be careful how you use it. Don&#x27;t get the teeth too close to your ears or forehead, or you could be sporting a cut. Or if you are like me who has a clumsy husband who walks like a drunken sailor, a bruise too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on amazon.com because they no longer carry them in my local Sally Beauty Supply store.  My blowdryer is a Conair, so when it said that it was a universal fit, I wasn&#x27;t worried.  The pic came and lo and behold, it is NOT a universal fit and this Conair Straightening Pic does not fit my Conair hair dryer.  I will be returning.</li>
    <li> Very stable even though the comb teeth seem thin. Unfortunately doesn&#x27;t fit the conair dryer well, so I use hospital tape on the dryer to hold the comb on while I blow dry my hair, so it kinda sucks for that, but the comb itself is okay.</li>

It would be nice if Conair created a comb with thicker teeth made of more flexible plastic. My other dry had a great attachment however the dryer didn&#x27;t have ion technology.</li>
    <li> This attachment is NOT a universal fit for all blow dryers.</li>
    <li> Great addition to a Conar hair dryer. Great for straitening hair and also for shaping.</li>
    <li> It fits incredible good on my blower!!! Is suuuuper durable and don&#x27;t break your hair!!! Im extremely happy for this purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I purchase this attachment from my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply and had yo return it I own a conair hand held blow dryer but trust me it doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
    <li> Keep having to buy these as the teeth break so easily after about 6 months</li>
    <li> i have two different blow-dryers and this straightening comb attachment did not fit either so i couldn&#x27;t use it. the packaging says it&#x27;s \\&quot;universal\\&quot; but it is not.</li>
    <li> The teeth on this have a bit of flexibility and do not break as easily like the cheaper ones. Worth the few extra dollars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this pic because I needed to be able to pick and dry my hair quickly in the morning. The description says universal fit, but it isn&#x27;t really.

    <li> doesn&#x27;t hold on for long and breaks easily</li>
    <li> One size does not fit all! My hair dryer was a Con air and wasn&#x27;t very big either. Had to send this pik back.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Infiniti by Conair (223NP), 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic 2-in-1 Styler (hair dryer) along with this product as I wanted to make sure that I used the same brand to avoid issues with the pic not being able to attach to the hair dryer.  However, when the product arrived I noticed that the pic attachment did not fit the hair dryer.</li>
    <li> It works well, and is adjustable, the only reason it didnt get 5 stars from me is because it tends to come off every once in a while because it doesnt \\&quot;lock on\\&quot; to the dryer.</li>
    <li> Supposed to fit in any con air , but won&#x27;t  fit in mine. Going to return it.</li>
    <li> Does not stay on the conair blackbird blow dryer.  Falls off every time you comb through your hair.</li>
    <li> This comb only lasted about 2 weeks after it scratched my beautiful Paul Mitchell dryer, began to melt, fall apart and the teeth broke.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  It didn&#x27;t fit my dryer and several of the teeth broke off after the first use.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be a universal comb attachment for conair.  Unfortunately, it did not fit my conair hair dryer, so I had to order a new hair dryer since I could not get a new comb attachment.</li>
    <li> This Conair Pro dryer pick straightens curly hair very well. However, due to repeat drying and cool-downs the teeth become weakened then break off after about 6 months usage and require replacement. I replace this at least 2-3x a year. Since this product is made in China and I&#x27;ve come to expect to replace items often. Is there a permanent hair dryer attachment for the Conair dryer out there somewhere? And if so what is it?</li>
    <li> This attachment did fit my Conair Blackbird hairdryer, but came apart when i used it.  The attachment has a sticker on it which warns that it can only be used on a low setting,which is useless for me.  I use my dryer for the heat, hence the teeth melted, attachment fell apart and had to be thrown away after one use.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> So I have a Conair Ionic Cord Keeper Blow dryer and another conair blow dryer and I TRIED BOTH OF THEM this is NOT a \\&quot;universal fit\\&quot; I&#x27;M SO PISSED I EVEN BOUGHT THIS S***</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas and tried to use it with my old hairdryer and new one (both Conair). It fits, but falls off as soon as I try to brush through my hair. What a waste.</li>
    <li> This attachment did not fit my Conair 1875 blowdryer. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Just the perfect attachment for my blow dryer, and great price.</li>
    <li> I think this blow dryer attachment is just &amp;#34;alright&amp;#34;. The only reason I rate it 3 stars is because it is one of only a couple on Amazon that fit my blow dryer. I think that these companies could produce higher quality attachments but they want you to spend money on new ones. The problems with this mentality is that there is only a limited amount of places that you can find them. This makes replacing them very inconvenient. This one worked great but only for a limited amount of time before almost half of the picks broke off. I will probably order again but only because there is only a limited amount of places to find them.</li>
    <li> I had this item for months and I finally decided to use it. it says universal but it keep falling off as soon as I try to use it. It never make it to my hair. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> It did the job, but it just didn&#x27;t do very long.  It wasn&#x27;t long before it popped off the blow dryer and would not reattach. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t either of my conair dryers.</li>
    <li> This device is good for what it is, but must I keep replacing them!! The ends keep breaking!</li>
    <li> I bought this item in 2013 and by mid 2014 it fell apart. I will not repurchase or recommend this item.</li>
