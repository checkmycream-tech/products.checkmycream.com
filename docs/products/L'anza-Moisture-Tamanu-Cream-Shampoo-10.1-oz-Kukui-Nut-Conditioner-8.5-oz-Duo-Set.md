      <li>Great product and shipping was super fast!!</li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s price was reasonable, but there&#x27;s no way I would pay retail for something that works just as good as biolage or John Frieda.</li>
      <li>The smell is great and it leaves hair super soft and manageable even if you don&#x27;t use the conditioner.</li>

      <li>This conditioner is much thicker than any other I&#x27;ve ever found and it is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Products were good, but I like some of their other shampoos and conditioners better than these for color retention, shine, and softness.</li>
      <li>Made me hair smell and feel soft and amazing.</li>

      <li>Worth the price</li>
      <li>I have tried it all to repair my porous overbleached fried from  high end products &amp; treatments ( pricier than this) , homemade organic treatments (temporary effects from wash to wash) , and almost anything I read w good reviews such as this product</li>
      <li>I would normally wash my hair every day, but with this product I can go 2 days and still feels clean.</li>
      <li>* homemade remedies mostly from Pinterest and salon stylist recommendations : olive oil , honey , yogurt , egg white , hair mask !&lt;</li>

      <li>Tried so many different brands</li>
      <li>but I really recomended, my hair is very dried and is getting better with these shampoo and conditioner!!</li>

      <li>I have very thick, course hair and it makes my hair feel great.</li>
      <li>Works very well on my course color treated hair.</li>

      <li>My hair has improved so much since using it.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t really like the smell of it.</li>
      <li>it really leaves my hair in good shape--a little dab all it takes-will last as long as the watered down stuff, but with great results</li>
      <li>I live that!</li>
      <li>My coarse dehydrated straw like hair drank this up instantly and renewed itself feeling so much more stronger and smoother.</li>
      <li>A quick trim and switch to Lanza and my hair looks 30 years younger!</li>
      <li>Trust me when I say my hair got super damaged this last platinum bleaching</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my hair smell good and look and feel so soft while minimizing frizz. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was a bit scared to buy these products from the website..but I really recomended, my hair is very dried and is getting better with these shampoo and conditioner!!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my stylist, this is a GREAT product for superfine hair. She suggested I use it after I showed up with dry, brittle ends. A quick trim and switch to Lanza and my hair looks 30 years younger! It&#x27;s soft, touchable, and static free—always a problem for those of us with babyfine hair.</li>
    <li> Works very well on my course color treated hair. It compares to Kenra and Colorproof brands which I like a lot also. I really LOVE the Lanza serum which smooths my hair and leaves it soft and silky! Great company .</li>
    <li> Lanza is just fantastic! So is the shipper</li>
    <li> This shampoo is nothing like it was advertised.  My hair is very dry no matter how much conditioner I use and my hair falls out by bunches when I shampoo.l  Will never buy this again</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I have very thick, course hair and it makes my hair feel great.</li>
    <li> These are excellent products and worth every penny.  My hair is so soft now.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling dry.</li>

    <li> Makes hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and it leaves hair super soft and manageable even if you don&#x27;t use the conditioner. The conditioner is the same. Very nice</li>
    <li> The shampoo &amp; conditioner are good- but not THAT good. Amazon&#x27;s price was reasonable, but there&#x27;s no way I would pay retail for something that works just as good as biolage or John Frieda.</li>
    <li> Lanza rocks! I&#x27;ve been using their products for a few years but this is my first time using this particular formula. We recently moved to Arizona where it&#x27;s hot and DRY. My hair was definitely feeling dry and I definitely needed a little more moisture in my routine. I switched to this and immediately noticed a difference, my hair feels full and healthy and looks so shiny and beautiful. I use it combined with Lanza&#x27;s healing health neemplant serum and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to know:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s very concentrated so a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;-It smells so good (like a Hawaiian vacation)&lt;br /&gt;-The size of the bottles is average, not the sample size or a huge size.&lt;br /&gt;-It was very well packaged and shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-I could see this making very fine hair &amp;#34;too moisturized&amp;#34;. But it works very well in my averagely thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;-You&#x27;ll never want to go back.</li>
    <li> These are great after applying you can feel the effect the shampoo has while washing the conditioner leaves hair butter soft and they smell good. Worth the price they are more expensive at ulta.</li>
    <li> Great products. Made me hair smell and feel soft and amazing. Great deal on this website as well.</li>
    <li> Products were good, but I like some of their other shampoos and conditioners better than these for color retention, shine, and softness.</li>
    <li> Only have to use a small amount. I live that!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has done wonders for my dry, curly hair and it smells phenomenal. I normally find that I use a lot of conditioner but I actually use a nominal amount of this product and see great results.</li>
    <li> Itvtook a long time to get my order.&lt;br /&gt;It took a long time to get notice that it shipped. About 10 days. After that, the&lt;br /&gt;product arrived in about 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;When it did arrive, I opened it and the shampoo was leaking and spilled all over the bag it was wrapped in. Otherwise, the shampoo and conditioner work great</li>
    <li> This stuff has my hair so dry and very brittle.  I won&#x27;t use it again.  It&#x27;s gaining into the trash as I type.</li>
    <li> Although I was a bit setback about the fact that it had packaging tape along the openings but it probably was just in case it didn&#x27;t open in the mail. My boyfriend&#x27;s family owns and are hair gurus in several salons in MA. They recommended that this would do wonders for anyone&#x27;s hair. I concur. :)</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good for me as I thought it would be.  I&#x27;ve since switched to another brand</li>
    <li> I love this duo. They both smell awesome and work great. I have curly, frizzy hair and my curls are more defined. I do think my hair is less dry after using this duo. Tried so many different brands and I can say that L&#x27;anza is my favourite.</li>
    <li> Great product and shipping was super fast!!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Works well with my dry thick hair.</li>
    <li> Love these!  Smells sooooooo good. Hair is soft and conditioned well. Shampoo gives me that good lather I like. Conditioner is thick so sometimes is a little tough to get out of the bottle but it is creamy once you run your hands together and begin to put in your hair. Great product. Have bought it a few more times now since this initial order.</li>
    <li> It does a good job of cleaning my hair but it doesn&#x27;t feel soft and smooth until after I use the conditioner. My hair felt good after ussing it. The price was good compared to my local retailer so if you are interested this would be the place to buy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. If your hair is chronically dry and damaged you will be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have chronically very dry hair. In years past, I&#x27;ve done everything including leave in thick cream conditioner. I usually also leave in another product. This conditioner is much thicker than any other I&#x27;ve ever found and it is wonderful. It also smells like heaven. My hair has improved so much since using it.</li>
    <li> Love this product always purchased from my Hair dresser until I found on Amazon and a great price.</li>
    <li> I just love this product.</li>
    <li> Omg AMAZING product ! My hair feels so much healthier and improved instant difference ! The shampoo and conditioner smell divine like something hawaain, reminds me of the Lanza healing neem serum smell but better . My coarse dehydrated straw like hair drank this up instantly and renewed itself feeling so much more stronger and smoother. I AM IMPRESSED! I have tried it all to repair my porous overbleached fried from  high end products &amp; treatments ( pricier than this) , homemade organic treatments (temporary effects from wash to wash) , and almost anything I read w good reviews such as this product but I had not found anything nearly as good ! Trust me when I say my hair got super damaged this last platinum bleaching I don&#x27;t know what the lady used but she ruined my head and my crown area hair broke off leaving me with short pieces that are coarse and fried on top ( how ugly) nothing has worked to lock in moisture till this product ! I first did the conditioner on slightly damp hair and went about my day leaving it in for about 5 hours as a deep treatment (I know the intensity my hair needs!) then rinsed it off , used very little shampoo , then rinsed it off and conditioned for a few minutes washing it off with cold water. WOW ! I loved the smell , creamy texture , and the easy application and removal , my hair felt clean and silkier even wet ! Once it air dryed it looked so shiny and felt so soft , I had not felt this since before the last traumatic over bleaching! I am soooo happy I bought this and gave it a try , seller was so quick &amp; I loved that it came in their original boxes as well as inside zip lock bags to to prevent any damage A+++ ! I will continue to purchase here and look for more Lanza Healing Products! My thirsty hair is very happy !&lt;br /&gt;* I have used the following shampoo/conditioner lines in search of something to save my hair : matrix , macademia argon , nexus , redken, it&#x27;s a 10 miracle , and others from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply , but NOTHING compares to this for my badly damaged hair type !&lt;br /&gt;* homemade remedies mostly from Pinterest and salon stylist recommendations : olive oil , honey , yogurt , egg white , hair mask !&lt;br /&gt;* I wash my hair about every  2-3 days, I have been bleaching on &amp; off for about 10 years always a shade of blonde / highlights year round, and my hair type is medium length , thin in some areas , damaged , dry brittle , traumatized , can&#x27;t use cheap shampoos as they make it worse, and can&#x27;t go without leave in treatments or hair serum as it will look dull ! Hope this helps someone , try it out leave it in and you will love it !&lt;br /&gt;*****I included before and after pics , the platinum is right after lady damaged it and my long front bangs broke off , second is of the same hair just a shade darker to hide some damage but color can&#x27;t hide the awful texture sadly ! This second pic was hair air dryed no styling to Make it an equal comparison , my hair is a work in progress I will update pic when I finish these new bottles !</li>
    <li> it really leaves my hair in good shape--a little dab all it takes-will last as long as the watered down stuff, but with great results</li>
    <li> great product hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Wow, it smells amazing. My hair feels great. I got my parents to buy their own.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair products!  Plus, they smell delicious!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, my hair is so soft and shiney.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair healthy and shiny</li>
    <li> I love this product brings my hair back to life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, does the job. I just don&#x27;t really like the smell of it. Can&#x27;t get past that. Bummer</li>
