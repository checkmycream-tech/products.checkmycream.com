      <li>Fine lines and wrinkles &lt;</li>
      <li>Here are some of the things that the cream helps.&lt;br /&gt;- Fine lines and wrinkles&lt;</li>
      <li>It helps with fine lines and wrinkles, crows feet as well as puffiness under your eyes.  </li>
      <li>but I do enjoy the metallic-silver finish (though it can get finger prints quite easily.</li>
      <li>Pleasant scent and all natural.</li>
      <li>Lightly scented but not so strong to knock you over with.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is light and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Unlike some moisturizing creams, this is a light cream.</li>
      <li>My fingers were smooth and moisturized.</li>

      <li>It is a cream texture but it did apply very smoothly, easily and absorbed into my skin quite quickly.</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overly thick and best of all</li>
      <li>Then the next step is to apply a good pump full of the Origins moisturizer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, I love supporting products &amp; companies in USA and this is made right here in America!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>The company was very courteous, friendly, and fast in getting back to me when I had a question.  </li>
      <li>I received this item quickly from the seller.</li>
      <li>This item shipped surprisingly quickly.</li>
      <li>The cream has a great clean but not overwhelming scent</li>
      <li>I have been loving this anti aging cream by Origins, as it doesn’t just moisturize my face…it has also been a big help as far as eradicating my fine lines!</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and smooth after applying this cream and I love how bright my face is now beginning to look after a few weeks of using</li>
      <li>It actually gave my skin a glow and nice luminosity to it too which I didn&#x27;t expect</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t honestly care about it having SPF as some of my foundations and such have SPF in them.</li>
      <li>I have recieved this product pretty quick after my order was placed.</li>
      <li>I have to note that the seller shipped the product super fast!</li>
      <li>just the right amount comes out.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy that aspect of the product and how it is pretty much scent-free, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Origins Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a gentle skin rejuvenating cream that’s full of amino acids which help skin retain moisture and repair itself.</li>
      <li>It has a light scent that I wouldn&#x27;t really describe as girly, so anyone could use it really if they wanted to.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are clear to read, and the instructions or suggested uses can easily be found.</li>
      <li>This is a moisturizer that claims to help with your signs of aging and to help you appear younger and more fresh looking.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t, I wouldn&#x27;t let the scent discourage you as it was nice and light and not strong and overpowering.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t leave any irritation to my skin but was very gentle.</li>
      <li>and I definitely plan to buy more when I am close to running out.</li>
      <li>This is a “must try”!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
      <li>The first day of trying it I used it in the morning underneath of my makeup.</li>
      <li>The product does tingle at first but nothing to worry about.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen all these first hand since using this product.</li>
      <li>But hey you live once right!?</li>
      <li>Now let me first explain, I am a licensed makeup artist and am VERY picky with what moisturizer I use in the morning underneath my makeup.</li>
      <li>The scent is very neutral and would be good for a female or male.</li>
      <li>This product also claims to help your skin from becoming further damaged but I can&#x27;t honestly say if that&#x27;s true as I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  </li>

    <li> Origins by Luxurience is just what my face has been asking for. It is as luxurious as it sounds and leaves my face feeling pampered and beautiful. This particular cream is great for my skin because I have very sensitive skin and this cream is hypo-allergenic. It has a light scent that I wouldn&#x27;t really describe as girly, so anyone could use it really if they wanted to. It is thick and creamy, but goes on feeling light and airy. My skin feels soft and smooth after applying this cream and I love how bright my face is now beginning to look after a few weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dark circles around my eyes and they are starting to disappear and my skin is hydrated and healthy for this time of year. Often my skin is left feeling dry and itchy during the cold months, especially in years like this where the weather goes from bearably cool to freezing cold within a few days, or even hours. My skin feels and looks genuinely rejuvenated when I use this cream and it seems my tone is evening out. I use this cream twice a day and it has done wonders for my face and confidence. This is a very good cream and I definitely plan to buy more when I am close to running out. (it takes very little to cover my face, so it lasts a while from what I can tell so far)</li>
    <li> Very smoothe and creamy. My skin feels very moist without being overly thick. Just enough to feel hydrated. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Great product; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for nice, creamy, and silky Moisturizer, then you are going to want to try this! Luxuriant sent this to me for testing purposes and for a review on my blog! I have been using this for about 3 weeks and I am Loving the way my skin is feeling! My face is 42 years old, so it needs all the help with moisturizing that I can get! And this is some amazing stuff! I used it every morning and every night and I am so impressed with my results! I promis, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a super product and works to brighten your skin for a younger look at 55 it has done miracle&#x27;s for me.  Pleasant scent and all natural.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer smells like peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and goes on smooth. Super absorbent and leaves your skin soft and silky. Helps with my dry, uneven skin tone. Hopefully with continued use I will see more improvements.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid thirties and I am a big fan of anti aging products. However, I have to be careful of what brands to use because I have very sensitive and perpetually dry skin. I have been loving this anti aging cream by Origins, as it doesn’t just moisturize my face…it has also been a big help as far as eradicating my fine lines! This is a “must try”!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> This anti-aging moisturizer is hypo-allergenic which I love.  I am very sensitive to fragrances and a lot of formulas are too harsh for my sensitive skin.  I didn’t have any problems at all with this product: no itchy swollen eyes, no dry patches, and no increased redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say my skin has not been looking as dull. This product moisturizes well for a day cream.  I also feel that it helps with the overall condition of my skin which is naturally dry and patchy red.  I feel like my skin hasn’t been as dry or red using this with my other skincare routine products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a fan of the bottle because the pump lets you control how much you use.  I also think it’s less germy than using tubs that you constantly stick your fingers in to scoop out product.  The Origins anti-aging cream is white, has a mild minty scent, and feels a little minty when you apply to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good moisturizer and has worked very well on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I love supporting products &amp; companies in USA and this is made right here in America!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more reviews visit my blog at SurveysByStephanie.tumblr.com!</li>
    <li> It has nice minty smell, it&#x27;s very light moisturizer. I can see the difference when I put some on my fingers. My fingers were smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I received this item quickly from the seller. I will say I was pleasantly surprised when I opened my package, The Anti-Aging Moistureizer is in a lovely tube with a push down pump so just the right amount comes out. The ingredients are clear to read, and the instructions or suggested uses can easily be found. Just a few ingredients are; Witch hazel, Shea butter, and Green tea extract along with peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Origins Illuminates dull skin &amp; enhances the skin&#x27;s natural defenses, preventing future damage while using plant based ingredients.. and who doesn&#x27;t want better skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away i could smell peppermint, this scent isn&#x27;t to strong or too weak. I find the aroma very pleasant, and brought back memories of sitting on Santa&#x27;s lap as a child. The scent is very neutral and would be good for a female or male. The texture is smooth and milky in color. It&#x27;s not overly thick and best of all it&#x27;s not overly oily where other moisturizer can leave a very shiny surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used afew Anti-Aging Moistureizer in the past and most all of them smell the same, this ones different, and stands out of the pack. As for results it does moisturize, help with dull lifeless skin, dry, uneven skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen all these first hand since using this product. As for the Anti-Aging side you will have to use it regularly to see results. Results include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fine lines and wrinkles &lt;br /&gt;- Crow&#x27;s feet and puffiness under your eyes &lt;br /&gt;- Bland, dull, or rough skin &lt;br /&gt;- Sun damage &lt;br /&gt;- Dry Dehydrated Skin &lt;br /&gt;- Uneven skin tone and texture </li>
    <li> This is a hypo-allergenic cream which can be used for women or men because it doesn&#x27;t have a flowery scent but rather a neutral fragrance. I did detect a very light minty scent which was nice but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. It didn&#x27;t leave any irritation to my skin but was very gentle.It  left my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized. I received free product for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Love this product goes very light and dries quickly I started seeing results in a few days!</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail last week and I&#x27;m so excited!  The cream has a great clean but not overwhelming scent and it goes on light and smooth!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for my skin!</li>
    <li> For the most part I do enjoy this anti-aging serum. The product itself looks a bit plain but I do enjoy the metallic-silver finish (though it can get finger prints quite easily. I tested this product out for about 2-3 weeks and I have not seen much of a difference. My skin is a bit sensitive as well but this one did not irritate it at all! I really enjoy that aspect of the product and how it is pretty much scent-free, in my opinion. It is a cream texture but it did apply very smoothly, easily and absorbed into my skin quite quickly. It works in that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My skin has been a bit dull these past few weeks and with the colder weather coming, this product did help me keep my &amp;#34;natural glow&amp;#34; although it isn&#x27;t the hugest difference. This product is also a bit more pricey than other anti-aging products that I reviewed although with the coupon code below, it is about the same price. The code should be good until the end of the year only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall I personally would debate whether or not to repurchase, I really enjoy the pump applicator, the smooth application, the little to no scent product and how moisturizing it felt but on the other hand I have not seen any dramatic results of improvement. Yes I did see some improvement but not a whole lot. It could also be the fact that I am still young (18 years old) and don&#x27;t have as many anti-aging problems as for example, a woman in her late 40s. I have not seen any new wrinkles or any discolorations appear since using the product so I can say that it has been working for me! For me when purchasing moisturizers, serums and such, I always check out the ingredients list and check if the product will work for me that way. I highly recommend you all to do the same as well. You don&#x27;t want to break out in hives over an allergic reaction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review, all words are mine*</li>
    <li> Origins Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a gentle skin rejuvenating cream that’s full of amino acids which help skin retain moisture and repair itself. All that goodness blends together to give you a moisturizer and anti-aging cream to help your skin appear more radiant. Your skin can find its youthful brilliance again with Origins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the review on my blog in exchange for this product, I used Origins in the morning as my main moisturizer. It has a great peppermint scent, a really light fragrance. After about a month, I’ve noticed a subtle brightening in my skin. The texture of my skin has improved slightly. I’m seeing results, so I’m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This item shipped surprisingly quickly. It tingles when I put it on. It has a light silky texture and smells a little like peppermint.</li>
    <li> I recently had the opportunity to try an Anti-Aging Cream from Origins by Luxurience! I really love creams, so I was happy to try this one out! Luxurience sent me this cream for reviewing purposes. I have to note that the seller shipped the product super fast! I was pretty pleased with the packaging as well. I like that it comes in a tube with an attached pump top! Pumps are really convenient and much less messy.  The cream has a really think formula, so I see this lasting me quite awhile. It smells very lightly like peppermint, which is great for the holidays! If you’re on the market, check them out! (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> I have recieved this product pretty quick after my order was placed. The smell isn&#x27;t anything bad and doesn&#x27;t smell strong either. The product does tingle at first but nothing to worry about. Just means the product must be working for me. The texture is smooth and comfortable. Would recommend to anyo e else. Give it a shot and a price you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. Unlike some moisturizing creams, this is a light cream. It makes your face feel soft without being suffocated. The cream also smells nice, but not over-powering. There is also a nice tingling sensation after you put on the cream. As someone with sensitive skin, I have been using the cream 2 times per day without any problem. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I am a guy who has very dry skin I got this to try on my face and it is the best , I was using something else before trying this and I will reorder this when I am out , and I cant get over the smell it is so nice , I wish they would make it into a candle ! try this if you need a good moisturizer you will love it . or if your guy needs something pick this up for him !</li>
    <li> It is thick and full a pump goes along way. It is a nice feeling moisturizer.  The quality of the bottle and pump are nice. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! So you wash your face morning and night. Then the next step is to apply a good pump full of the Origins moisturizer. Make sure you are doing upward and outward motions. Don&#x27;t forget the neck area too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is safe for both men and women alike to use. With this product you will have less appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Your skin will have more of a glow to it. With further use of this product you will notice sun damage or skin damage lighten up. Lightly scented but not so strong to knock you over with.</li>
    <li> The company was very courteous, friendly, and fast in getting back to me when I had a question.  The shipment was very quick as well...virtually no wait . So with these two things I started off pleased and happy with high hopes for the product. This is a moisturizer that claims to help with your signs of aging and to help you appear younger and more fresh looking.  It helps with fine lines and wrinkles, crows feet as well as puffiness under your eyes.  It also mentions making your dull dry skin appear brighter and more hydrated and youthful as well as helping to even out your skin tone. Well wow, that&#x27;s just a whole lot of things this moisturizer claims to do. ALL that in one bottle?!?! I figured if this moisturizer can do all that with just one product, I&#x27;m sold. Prior to this moisturizer I was using a separate product for all of the above problems! This moisturizer alone could cut out 90% of my routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer did NOT let down!  The first day of trying it I used it in the morning underneath of my makeup. Now let me first explain, I am a licensed makeup artist and am VERY picky with what moisturizer I use in the morning underneath my makeup. I have a ton of creams and lotions I use at night as I am not picky with them, but I might have possibly one or two I trust to use in the morning.  I don&#x27;t want something heavy and thick but rather something that will seep into my skin quickly and still keep me moisturized throughout the day without leaving my skin an oily, slick, shiny mess. If your moisturizer leaves your skin slick from not soaking in well, your foundation will slip and slide all over your face and not apply evenly. Especially around my T-zone area. I&#x27;m an oily beast there. I don&#x27;t honestly care about it having SPF as some of my foundations and such have SPF in them. Moisturizer is the canvas to your makeup. If your canvas is jacked up, your foundation will look horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with all that being said, I was hesitant to try thisout in the morning. But hey you live once right!? WOW, I was SURPRISED to say the least!! This stuff did NOT disappoint! It was light like I want and soaked into my skin without leaving me oily and my skin slick.  It kept my skin hydrated throughout the day and I definitely did not have to blot the oil off my face nearly as much as I normally would do during the day. It actually gave my skin a glow and nice luminosity to it too which I didn&#x27;t expect so that was also a nice surprise! The scent of this too was pleasant, it had a significant peppermint smell.  If you like the smell of peppermints you&#x27;ll love this then. If you don&#x27;t, I wouldn&#x27;t let the scent discourage you as it was nice and light and not strong and overpowering.  Plus It wasn&#x27;t like I could smell the peppermint after it was applied.  I would actually recommend this product to women AND men as the scent isn&#x27;t floral or fruity or even musky.  It is a nice unisex scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can be multi-use as you can use this other places than just your face like your arms, hands, cuticles even.  I put this on my eyes and it helped keep them hydrated and the dark circles to lighten and brighten.  I feel like this product helped my skin feel refreshed and rejuvenated.  This product also claims to help your skin from becoming further damaged but I can&#x27;t honestly say if that&#x27;s true as I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it did though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is a pump dispenser which i like.  I won&#x27;t end up wasting most of the product from not being able to squeeze it out! It is also convenient if you want to throw it in your bag and bring along with you and not have to worry about the cap opening up in your bag and getting all over your things!  At $34.95 for a 1 ounce bottle I&#x27;d say is a bit pricey but honestly, for the money it is totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This cream tingles for a few minutes. It must be working. It has a good price.</li>
    <li> These are the ingredients in the Orgins face cream:Witch hazel, Shea butter, and Green tea extract along with peppermint. The Orgins makes your dull skin brighter and enhances your skins natural defense to prevent future damage. This smells just like peppermint which I love. Just an added bonus. A face cream to use regularly to keep your face looking and feeling its best. Here are some of the things that the cream helps.&lt;br /&gt;- Fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;- Crow&#x27;s feet and puffiness under your eyes&lt;br /&gt;- Bland, dull, or rough skin&lt;br /&gt;- Sun damage&lt;br /&gt;- Dry Dehydrated Skin&lt;br /&gt;- Uneven skin tone and texture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately while I loved the smell and feel of this product it caused breakouts. Tried several times with same results.</li>
