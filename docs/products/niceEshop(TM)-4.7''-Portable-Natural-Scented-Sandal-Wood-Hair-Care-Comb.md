<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this to use as an beard pocket comb, glad that I did. Combs through my sometimes nappy beard hair with little to no tugging at the hairs, I&#x27;m seeing hardly no hairs in the sink. It also leaves the sweet smell of sandalwood in my beard. For care/cleaning of the comb use oils like olive, coconut, or jojoba and a toothbrush. Oil the teeth of the comb, then run the toothbrush gently through the comb. Also every once an a while(I&#x27;d say twice a month) put the oil all over the comb then place in a plastic bag overnight or longer, that keeps the wood from getting too dry an your comb will last a lifetime. Do not use water on this comb, water and wood are not a good combination. Water will seep inside the comb causing it to swell, an to get splinters thus ruining the comb!</li>
    <li> My husband enjoys this comb. It has nice scent.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this but I think it smells like medicinal bug repellent.  It&#x27;s not appealing to me at all.  The comb looks well made and feels sturdy, but the teeth are so close together that it won&#x27;t go through my thick hair.  It also is shipped from outside the US and took weeks to arrive.  That&#x27;s not a big deal if you know about it when you place your order but I didn&#x27;t see anywhere on the page that it mentioned this, so be forewarned.</li>
    <li> Well made, nicely finished and solid, not flimsy. No discernible scent.</li>
    <li> i have to add my 2 cents to the already stellar reviews this item is getting. you will love this comb. i mean when is the last time you got excited about a comb? never? same here. but this came in the mail about an hour ago and i can&#x27;t stop using it or smelling it. so smooth on my beard and head. just wanted people to know that those other reviews are not hype.,  i wish i would have ordered 2 or 3, seriously its that great. i know, i know, it&#x27;s just a comb. what can i say?: go ahead and get it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The longer I use this comb, the more impressed I am with it. My initial impression was that it&#x27;s much larger than I would expect a comb to be. The handle is 1/2&amp;#34; wide - this is a very substantial wooden object. However the craftsmanship is very good. All the edges are sanded to a very smooth, rounded shape. The teeth feel comfortable against my scalp and never snag my hair. There is also an attractive floral motif laser-engraved on each side of the comb.  I waited several months to write a review because I wanted to see if the scent would fade. It hasn&#x27;t. Which tells me that the wood itself truly is scented; it&#x27;s not just a fragrance that was rubbed onto the surface of the wood. BUT. This comb does not smell anything like sandalwood. I am a soapmaker  so I have bottles of Indian sandalwood, Haitian sandalwood and other resins. The comb smells exactly like the resin of guaiac wood - I can only describe it as woodsy with notes of basil and something vaguely reminiscent of rose. It&#x27;s pleasant, but definitely not sandalwood.</li>
    <li> Great smell and no static! Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a nicely made comb with fresh scent of sandalwood. The item arrived with no breaks or damages. You will get the exactly same item as the picture describes. The shipping took a while compared to the other items that I have ordered on Amazon, but that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me. Great purchase overall.</li>
    <li> Great comb . Saw the same thing for  Way more money</li>
    <li> The size and shape is very ergonomic for good control. The teeth taper to a more fine end then other wood combs I have used which is nice for smoothly going through my long hair but I find myself needing to be a bit more gentle with the pressure to the scalp. The wood itself is beautiful and I like the cut due to the lovely grain pattern. However, one of the teeth of my comb had a chip on arrival. Overall, a very nice comb for a great price.</li>
    <li> Well-built and nice scented comb! Teeth are long enough and very comfortable to hold!! Would buy again for gifts! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> You need a sandal wood comb......smells good; feels good and no static as you will read with any review. This one is quite exquisitely made with embossed design and is very solid - the teeth will not break easily but are fine enough to work with both beard &amp; moustache. Fits nicely enough in a front pocket, even with a wallet and is heavy enough that you won&#x27;t overlook it when you take the wallet out(I lost my last one when pulling out the wallet/didn&#x27;t notice that the comb dropped; it was of course smaller &amp; lighter).&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price and wait......one of Amazon&#x27;s increasing # of products coming &amp;#34; on a slow boat from China....&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It took quite a while to get here and when I took it out of the package it was bigger and thicker than I thought it was going to be. I was pretty sure I was going to hate it, but for the price I wouldn&#x27;t have really complained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, the width of the comb and the tooth spacing are perfect for my beard. I have been using a rather standard drugstore comb and feel as though a great deal of my beard winds up in the comb. This baby however flows through beautifully and even dealing with knots is gentler on my facial forestation. If you purchase this item and when it arrives you are concerned about the fact that it is so thick, I say, just give it a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. I know I was.</li>
    <li> Killer beard comb it&#x27;s my first comb but I love it and I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> love it.  it&#x27;s a nice, heavy comfortable little comb with pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Good look a bit lighter than the pic solid very well made my new faviorate beard comb</li>
    <li> I liked enough to buy a second one!</li>
    <li> Yes. Everything is great. You guy do a great job</li>
    <li> I would like to say  the quality of this  is very solid. I can hold it very easily .</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that i received this a week earlier that the expected date of delivery. Not only did it come early but the comb itself is very good quality. I got this as a beard comb and i couldnt be happier with it. I would highly  recommend this comb. Get one now stop thinking about it and get one, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It feels very nice in your hand, and it looks nice. The only thing is shipping took so long that I almost forgot I bought it by the time it arrived.</li>
    <li> This is a really great comb.  The only downside is waiting so long to get it.  I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it that it was shipping directly from China.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I would have known that, but now I am actually thinking of ordering some for my daughters.  They are that nice.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve ordered not one, not two, not three, but FOUR of these combs.  no, i&#x27;m not losing them, i just needed one for the house, one for my travel bag, one for my purse, and one to be shipped to my daughter (who also has long hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a very nice comb.  the teeth are well finished and do not snag my straight hair nor my daughter&#x27;s curlier hair.  it has a very light sandalwood scent but does not deposit scent on my hair.  i&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, and my subsequent re-purchases of this item!</li>
    <li> Beautiful with a great weight.</li>
    <li> Great beard comb, smells amazing and feels wonderful.  Priced right and shipping was okay.  For my beard I would prefer if the spines were a bit closer together for a finer combing experience but the photos make it clar the size of the comb.  What the photos do not clearly convey is the toneor color of the comb.  It is not dark or shiny but more of a pale matte or faded brown.  The comb smells amzing and realy the appeal of sandalwood is it&#x27;s natural scent.  Its a gret comb for a bag, purse (not that I carry one) or home but the size and easily breakable nature of wood make it not the bes idea for carrying in your pocket.  I had to take away two stars because I know how delicate these combs are and I really wanted a pocket comb that was notplastic or metal as static electricity these  types of combs produce is bad for the hair and scalp.  The sandalwood is comfortable and gentle on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#BTFU</li>
    <li> ordered this item because I read that wood is more gentle for your hair than plastic. I use it for my beard and it is a huge difference from plastic it combs though detangling with ease no snags or pinching. I have straight hair so for my scalp its not what I would use if you have kinky hair this would be for you. great beard comb</li>
    <li> This is a good size comb. Detangles hair easily. No more static in hair that is caused by plastic combs. Smells good. Oil your hair and use it to distribute oil all through hair shaft. Will be ordering more.   EDITED: - Ordered the second time from this seller. Received another comb which differs significantly in color. Now I understand not all wood is similar in color. However, I am amazed at why the newer comb is thicker and a little bigger than the one I received earlier?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb, and it&#x27;s made out of wood.</li>
    <li> excellent quality wood comb.&lt;br /&gt;arrived 2 weeks earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> This is a solid, good quality wooden comb. It took about a month to get here from Asia but I did not mind. Mine was not as dark as the picture but more of a lighter wood color. It is not cheap or flimsy feeling. The comb has a nice finish on the wood. It is a pleasure to hold and use on the hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> Had been wanting a wooden comb for some time. This arrived and is very well made and has the sandalwood scent, I liked it so much I bought  2 more one for my daughter and her daughter.</li>
    <li> Love it very much. Feels smooth and heavy.</li>
    <li> Looked more like a wider tooth comb than what it really is. Smells nice. The decoration doesn&#x27;t stand out too well either. I do like it and will use it. Just got a different impression of it from photo and description.</li>
    <li> This is excellent craftsmanship and just $5. Wow~such a great comb. Snag-free and lightly scented(a month plus later and I still smell the scent-but not in an annoying way-it&#x27;s like part of the wood). When you use this comb, the oils from your hair will just add to the sheen of the wood making this comb glide thru hair even better. If u are tender headed like me, this comb will take some getting used to. It&#x27;s a bit heavy in the hand,although it fits the hand well.  It&#x27;s when u place it on your head. I was used to plastic combs that weigh nothing, So I was using too much force when holding this one to my head. It&#x27;s not something you really think about. At first I hated it, but have learned to love it. You have to get used to just barely touching it to the head and gently dragging it through the hair. It will not snag. I have short baby fine hair and it tangles easily. This makes my tangles go away and seems to stimulate my scalp and makes my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Fairly sturdy comb that smells lightly of sandalwood without it being too overpowering. I have thick hair and this comb works nicely as a comb to carry around to maintain my often tangley hair. I would not recommend using on wet or damp hair. You aren&#x27;t supposed to brush you hair when wet anyways but the teeth are somewhat close together. The details are really cute and the comb has some weight to it which makes it feel less cheap. Definitely worth the 6$ I paid for it.</li>
    <li> The teeth feel great against scalp - just pointy enough to be massaging, not dull or scraping - and the sandalwood scent is enticing.</li>
    <li> I love this comb. Very thick, beautiful wood.</li>
    <li> This is my second wooden comb.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a wide tooth comb, more like normal tooth.  The tooth are slightly tapered toward the edges and it feels lovely on your scalp.  Fit perfectly in your palm and made to fit right in your hand.  Weight slightly heavier than your normal plastic or ox horn comb.  It is an excellent workmanship.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Lovely sandalwood scent, well-made with intricate engraving, sturdy and anti-static. I use it every night before bedtime to promote circulation. It does not snag and the wide bristles provide a relaxing scalp massage.</li>
    <li> Excellent comb. It&#x27;s made of wood, feels solid and more heavy than a plastic comb, and combing hair feels good with it. The shipping took over 2 weeks from China but it&#x27;s worth it. Even though it came from China it feels well made. As for the scent, I only notice it if I bring it close to my face, but it does smell nice.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t normally review items, but I can&#x27;t get over this comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very solid and sturdy build.  Teeth are smooth and don&#x27;t catch the hair.  And then there is the smell...incredible.  Can&#x27;t stop smelling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the price...well honestly, I would be willing to pay more for it then I did.</li>
    <li> Beautiful comb, smells great, and the price is nice.  Only one problem:  it&#x27;s too bulky and weighty to be a suitable men&#x27;s pocket comb.  If I could have comfortably fit it into my shirt pockets, I would have given it five stars.</li>
    <li> Love this comb.  It&#x27;s well crafted and sturdy.  It smells so nice and has retained the nice cedar-y smell for almost a year now.  A real pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> This is a good comb. It is very sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> I like it.  I never thought I would leave a review for a comb, but this one is pretty darn nice.  I keep it in my house and I will probably buy another to leave in my truck.</li>
    <li> Got this today and I love it.  The quality is really good and it smells so good.  I have thick , coarse wavy hair and it glides thru.  I think , like someone suggested I will have to put oil on it in the future to keep it from drying out.  Impressed,  well worth the four bucks for this and I havent seen anything like it in the stores.  And I forgot to mention it is pretty.</li>
    <li> Do not buy you definitely get what you pay for on this one it showed up with a foreign substance on it that smelled god awful I had my wife save the packaging in case I fell ill with a mysterious disease LOL It was only 4 bucks I think, so this went into the trash where it belongs.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality. Nice light aroma. Very handy for travel cases. :) I had got it for my friend, she is in love with it.</li>
    <li> This is the original review: I am disappointed.  People here mention subtle sandalwood smell, mine has a heavy chemical odor. I had to soak the comb in hot water to get rid of this terrible smell and as a result it still smells bad but the surface lost its luster.  Also, judging by the picture I expected a wider tooth but it&#x27;s just average. I had ordered 2 of them, one for a small gift, and I don&#x27;t know now if it was a good idea.  It looks nice though.    After a while the odor has gone and the comb has  a subtle sandalwood smell.  It feels wonderful to use the comb and I am planning to buy more to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> Suits my curly hair, and is very easy to clean. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The comb is beautiful and smells wonderful (not overpowering), but the tines are very close together, which would take approximately half a century to comb through my hair.  I ended up ordering one with wider tines and a handle because ain&#x27;t nobody got time fo that.  Very beautiful comb, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I had purchased this comb when I had waist-length hair and originally scored it 3 stars because I needed something with a wider tooth to get through all that hair.  I have since cut my hair short and this is the ONLY thing I use on my hair now, no other combs or brushes, just this.  SO MUCH LOVE.  I&#x27;m so glad I held onto it when it didn&#x27;t work well for me at first.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these combs.  They are well made and attractive.... great sandalwood scent too.</li>
    <li> Wood combs and brushes are second to none, seriously. If you aren&#x27;t yet using them, you should!  They don&#x27;t tug as much as plastic and they&#x27;re small enough to fit in pockets or purses.  I really like this one, more so than my others, perhaps because it&#x27;s thicker and very strong.  I was a bit confused when I received it as it has a sort of green tint going on, but it does smell nice and is much more gentle than plastic combs.  I use it on damp hair mostly, and for when I&#x27;m oiling my hair.  The comb doesn&#x27;t seem to mind being rinsed, so I hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a little while but it was worth it for the price of the comb. Great for a beard and I really like the natural sandalwood scent that it has.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this purchase. The comb is elegant and functional with light pleasant scent of sandal wood.</li>
    <li> Made of a solid piece of sandalwood, there&#x27;s no jagged, rough edges that would snag your hair.  Shipping seemed lengthy (before I realized it was shipping from China) but arrived on the first day of the projected delivery range.</li>
    <li> exactly as described has a real nice wood grain and has the scent of sandlewood it has decorative carving&lt;br /&gt;well worth the purchase thick heavy duty comb.</li>
    <li> Beautiful well made comb</li>
    <li> Much higher quality than I assumed . Also a tad larger than I expected . I am&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the overall quality size effectiveness and cost. The wood also smells decent too, a great pocket comb !</li>
    <li> This comb is heavier than I imagined and that is wonderful. So often I have had a comb break on my tangles and this comb seems strong enough to handle them. It also smells amazing, combing my hair is like a little spa time.</li>
    <li> It works well.  It&#x27;s a comb.  It&#x27;s only a comb.  If it didn&#x27;t work i would complain about it.  Really!</li>
    <li> Works great on thick, frizzy/staticy hair and feels great. It works great with my curly hair and my boyfriends tight curls. I ordered a 2nd one for my niece with angel-fine frizzy hair. I will never buy a plastic comb again!</li>
    <li> First time buying a wooden comb, and I love it. It&#x27;s sturdy but fits my small hands well, and my hair feels smooth instead of full of static. I&#x27;m buying a second one to keep in my car.</li>
    <li> Best comb I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> The comb is beautiful. My wife combs my hair every night before bed, and the comb works better than any other combs.</li>
    <li> During one of the classes the instructor mentioned that using a plastic comb to comb your hair created a field which did not serve the best purpose for the body and we should only use wooden combs and brushes.  I thought the concept was interesting.  He also mentioned that if you had an energy slump in the afternoon that you could increase you energy by combing all of the hair  back and then combing it forward and then combing your hair as you normally wear it.  This was an appealing thought...no more &amp;#34;energy boosting&amp;#34; items to consume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb has a light scent of Sandal Wood with very smooth teeth that  flows through the hair.  It has a nice weight to it and I like the length of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it a few days ago so I can&#x27;t give a detailed report on energy boosting but I am thinking it is doing something......whether it is in the comb, or being made aware of the field, it is a nice feeling.  The results will be judged by the individuals using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a part of the &amp;#34;Green Movement&amp;#34; for your health.</li>
    <li> A nice weight comb.  Hard to tell if it is sandalwood, but it smells nice, and is lovely.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous comb! The weight of it is lovely, the craftmanship is gorgeous, and it fits well in my hand for combing my hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure how well I&#x27;d do with a comb that didn&#x27;t have a handle, but this comb is really quite perfect. It goes through my (rather thick) hair smoothly, and smells really nice. The smooth, rounded teeth feel great on my scalp and, really, I&#x27;d get another one if I could right now. :)</li>
    <li> I search for a beard comb.  This came up, and it looked like it fit the requirement.  Ended up being huge, making it useless.</li>
    <li> What a nice comb! It is smooth, it removes tangles in my fine hair without tugging and it&#x27;s fragrance is very noticeable and pleasant. The rounded shape fits my head better than a flat comb. The substantial shaft is twice the thickness of other wooden combs and the teeth taper down gradually. I will never use a plastic comb again..</li>
    <li> My boyfriend LOVED the comb. The scent makes it that much love able!</li>
    <li> The one I bought had 30 teeth instead of the 26 on the picture, making it not as wide as i expected it.&lt;br /&gt;My comb also lost its color really fast and started to gain a green hue, but that could be due to my own negligence as this is my first wooden comb.&lt;br /&gt;The designs are very nice, but it is not as easy to see on mine as it is in this picture, but that is expected of a picture vs real life.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this comb. It has a bend to fit your scalp well, but the part you hold is a bit too big to be a portable comb.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I bought it was because my cheap plastic comb stabbed my head, and this one is a great replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the 6 dollars IMO.</li>
    <li> Lovely rich scent and nice size for regular use, seems strong and sturdy and well made.  Take care with thin hair not to scrape the scalp.</li>
