<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> though it says light, it is still a little dark for my fair complexion but does work decently otherwise</li>
    <li> Like it to cover and hide pimples and acne scars</li>
    <li> I get blemishes from time to time, but this definitely covers them up well AND it gets rid of them within the day most of the time. I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was a teen, and it&#x27;s still useful whenever I have an occasional breakout. Also, I have sensitive skin, and this is actually very nice on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t itch or cause irritation when I put it on, so that&#x27;s a big plus in my book</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I recommend it</li>
    <li> This works much better than L&#x27;oreal True Match concealer! I love the spongy applicator, and the concealer stays on better than others I have used. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my acne at all!</li>
    <li> I RECIEVED ALL THE ALMAY CLEAR COMPLEXION OIL , LIGHT 100, 0.18 OUNCE IN PERFECT CONDITION AND IN THE TIME LIKE I BUY, THANKS</li>
    <li> Awesome works really well lasts all day for me (I have dry skin) I have noticed that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t blend very well though, but just use a damp beauty blender and it&#x27;ll perfect. Also take your take time blending isn&#x27;t a fast process.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many concealers, over the years, and couldn&#x27;t find one that actually concealed anything, until I tried Almay Clear Complexion Oil Free Concealer.  Every concealer I&#x27;ve tried, in the past, wouldn&#x27;t cover up and it would run.  I have to wonder if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s oil free?  Regardless, it&#x27;s a great concealer, and I would recommend it.  It arrived very fast in the mail, and was packaged well.  I definitely give it a 5 Star Rating!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to most makeup which clogs pores and leads to breakouts on oily/acne prone skin. I like this cover-up because it looks natural and has a drying/healing effect on blemishes.</li>
    <li> its fine .. Not as good as some other cheap concealers I&#x27;ve tried. But I got it one shade too light as well so that might also be the culprit. It&#x27;s good for my acne, I have so much. But I have to blend it with my dior foundation to make it look more natural and that stuff is expensive!</li>
    <li> Rate:  Best acne/redness concealer I have used lasts all day. If u don&#x27;t wear makeup and only used this for spot treatment is not visibly noticable at all! 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions advice:  Use applicator to apply then use a cotton swab to blend and ur done!</li>
    <li> Fantastic concealer. I have mixed skin, leaning towards dry, and this doesn&#x27;t make the flaking worse. It blends easily, and I can wear it alone for spot treatment and under powder foundation. Absolutely love it, and it does seem to make a break out heal a little faster.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all; it isn&#x27;t what I expected or wanted and should have taken the time to send it back.  The color is not right for me.  It covers BUT needs to be blended in quite a bit and even after blending still seems to show where used.  Don&#x27;t use it and passing it on to someone else who might want it or I will just throw it away.  too much trouble to send back.</li>
    <li> Great coverage. Covers red spots and dark circles very well.</li>
    <li> This is a very very good product for very sensitive skin. I was very skeptical about it afraid that it would clog my pores but low and behold it didn&#x27;t . It covered my irritated red acne. It won&#x27;t clog my pores or dry out my skin and its unscented which is the best part.</li>
    <li> Blends with.skin color, has curative effect. Love it. Been using for over a year only had good luck with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer. It worked great in hiding any blemishes for me, and it also helps to dry out any blemishes you may have, such as acne. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even put a foundation over it, and it looks fine as is! I would definitely purchase again once I am in need of more concealer, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> been using this for years.  works well.  can be somewhat drying at times.  it has never irritated my very sensitive skin and seems to help clear up minor breakouts.</li>
