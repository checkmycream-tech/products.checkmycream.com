    <li> Well idk what was the issue previously, but I received both shampoo and conditioner. Both smell great and are regular redken quality!</li>
    <li> The listing days shampoo and conditioner but we only got the conditioner. Very disappointing. Conditioner works well though.</li>
    <li> Everything they promised.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars for the old Avocado Formula. If anyone is heartbroken like me about the old formula being changed there is a petition going to Redken to ask them to go back to the original.

    <li> Packaged very well. Thanks</li>
    <li> My stylist told me to get this after I did a Keratin treatment. It definitely keeps my hair feeling soft and I really enjoy the smell. Almost a little coconutty</li>
    <li> This is an affordable high quality product.  I have wavy thick Caucasian hair.</li>
    <li> Came just as described, and cheaper than my hair salon! This stuff makes my hair feel amazing!</li>
    <li> Professional Products, really make the difference</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo that leaves my hair feeling like silk. Great value!</li>
    <li> No complaints. Seems to do its job with my hair, which can be difficult, and it&#x27;s a great price:quantity ratio.</li>
    <li> Returned this because it was either expired or not actually Redken products. I thought I was getting a great deal online but I should&#x27;ve known better. My hair sure was happy to see this go.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, but I did not achieve the results I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Love Redkin soft .&lt;br /&gt;Used it for 6 years now along with the heavy cream moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great price for salon product.</li>
    <li> The container arrived broken and leaked all over. Not a good experience.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. I have platinum hair and use this in rotation with purple shampoo and other treatments. It always keeps my hair healthy and soft, and I never have those telltale thirsty flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say is that this might be too heavy for some people as a daily shampoo/conditioner combo over time. It&#x27;s perfect for me for use 3-4 times a week just to keep my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> excellent product, exactly as stated...excellent seller</li>
    <li> I have used Redken All soft for over 5 years.  I always purchased from my local salons, which I should have stuck to.  The product smells the same and feels like the same consistancy but after I used the product did not provide me true Redken all soft results.  Hair felt stringy and reminded me of how my hair felt when I would use drugstore shampoos &amp; conditioners.  It also left my scalp a little itchy.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. I have bought these products multiple times.. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Love the larger size.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> This is a complete scam. I just opened my package and only received the shampoo. I paid $50.00 for shampoo.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!! It makes my hair feel like silk and I will never use anything else after finally finding this. My hair is long and turning white and I&#x27;ve had a hard time with products making my hair feel like straw. Not anymore! Would recommend to anyone having issues with other products. I will pay the extra money for this product!</li>
    <li> so glad I found this here on Amazon. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner set. I switch between all soft and extreme varieties. The conditioner in particular I could not live without. Not sure why, but it&#x27;s the only conditioner that makes it possible to get a brush though my hair with no tangles.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair so soft. No greasy feeling just soft and smooth</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner combo i&#x27;ve ever had my hair has never felt silkier or softer before, I love Redken products and will continue to use and buy this set. Normally after I use a shampoo and conditioner set on my hair for awhile the effects it had at first seem to fade away but this one has not and it&#x27;s been well over 2 months now and my hair still feels amazon each time i use it.</li>
    <li> These Redken sulfate free hair products are fantastic. Great daily shampoo and conditioner that makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Just received my package and it only contains shampoo..</li>
