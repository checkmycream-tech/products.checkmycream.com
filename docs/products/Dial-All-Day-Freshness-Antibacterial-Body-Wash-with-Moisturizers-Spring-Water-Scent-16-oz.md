<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have Diabetes and starting to have some skin issues. My doctor recommended I purchase this particular item. So I did and....it works wonderfully. It has helped manage my skin issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many body washes. I continue to come back to Dial. You feel fresh and clean without any heavy fragrance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to mess up body wash but some companies do. This body wash isn&#x27;t too strongly scented, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I&#x27;m attracted to the antibacterial ingredients.</li>
    <li> Is what it is supposed to be.</li>
    <li> Great soap a must buy.</li>
    <li> Found this product at a much cheaper price than the store.  I will definitely order this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> product is nice and it smells pretty good. does what its suppose to do which is clean.  gets the dirt off..</li>
    <li> for your skin, keeps down that pesky bacteria that can make one a pariah....last a long time and does not dry your skin....so much cheaper that the stores.....I don&#x27;t get the chance to go often to the grocery or Target, so when I go I have to buy things in triplicate......this option stops that.....and it is such a good price!!!!</li>
    <li> It does a good job. I would have preferred something softer for my skin. No residual.</li>
    <li> I have been going to the gym every morning before work and showering there after my workouts. I was beginning to pick up some acne and unhappy looking skin and I assume it was from the germs and sweating at the gym. Picked this up and have been using it for a week or so and love it. It smells great, doesnt dry my skin like other soaps and rinses cleanly off of my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good, simple anti-bacterial body wash. This body wash is just what I wanted. The scent is pleasant without being overpowering. The gel produces a nice lather even without a cloth/loufa/whatever. I use this with just my hands and have found that it goes a long way. I have to use far less per shower than I had to with other body washes I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s not revolutionary, but it gets the job done well.</li>
    <li> This smells so good and it&#x27;s not just the gold whatevers. It has a fresh clean scent AND kills bacteria. I&#x27;m allergic to just about anything fun, so it&#x27;s nice to have a good smelling body wash that won&#x27;t break me out or put me in the hospital.</li>
    <li> I like this soap, but I really wish this was made by a company that didn&#x27;t test on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I switch up my body washes, but if there is an animal-friendly version of something similar out there, I&#x27;d be happy to give it a shot!</li>
    <li> Dial antibacterial soap was recommended for prior to and immediately after surgery.  Amazon has it for the best price and it arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good soap. I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make me itch. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. I have tried all different kinds/brands of body wash and for me this has been the only body wash that does not dry out my skin and they all smell great!</li>
    <li> Suds up really nice and you only use a small amount.  I love it.  I&#x27;ll order more. I really love the scent.</li>
    <li> Most antibacterial soaps can dry your skin, and this doesn&#x27;t. Nice all around everyday soap. Don&#x27;t know what else I can say except that the Dial brand has been around for many decades, and is a trusted product, and is always trying to improve their products. Remember the commercial? &amp;#34;You use Dial. Don&#x27;t you wish everybody did?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Some time ago my physician recommended that I start using an antibacterial soap when I shower.  I followed his orders.  I fear there were problems connected to this change of soaps.  First, all of the antibacterial soaps I tried (when I could find them) tended to dry my skin out.  I am no \\&quot;spring chicken,\\&quot; by any stretch, but neither have I hit complete geezer status either.  But due to age my skin is a lot dryer now than when I was young.  That is just a fact of life you learn to deal with.  Now having dry skin to begin with, I most certainly did not need a product that did further damage.  This Dial Body wash, of all the brands I have tried, does the best job of moisturizing my skin and fighting off the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem was scent.  I very much dislike heavily scented soaps.  While this soap is indeed scented, it is a very light scent and has the most natural smell of any of the soaps I have tried.  In addition to that, after using this stuff I actually feel very, very clean.  It does not leave that \\&quot;soapy feeling\\&quot; I got with so many of the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, so many of the antibacterial soaps I tried came only in bars.  These bars are relatively expensive and they seem to quickly vanish with use; not so with this body wash.  A bottle of this stuff goes a long, long way and I can regulate the amount used much better than bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the effectiveness of the antibacterial element of the soap I of course have not a clue as I have not taken cultures of my skin.  I will say though that since using this product I have had no problems with skin infections what so ever.  Cuts and scratches and that sort of thing do not give me the problems they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing of note here is the price on Amazon.  While the listed price of the soap is actually a bit less than I pay at a local drug store, there is the shipping charges to consider.  If you add those charges in, it makes a significant difference.  On the other hand, I not that this particular soap is, at times, difficult to find locally and I suppose if I end up not being able to find it at all I will anti up the extra coinage and buy here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarksother hand, I not that this particular soap is, at times, difficult to find locally and I suppose if I end up not being able to find it at all I will anti up the extra coinage and buy here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarks</li>
    <li> I always buy antibacterial body wash to keep my body from bumps and sores from unknown bacteria.  Dial seems to be the only product that sells &#x27;antibacterial&#x27; washes.  When I see the name &#x27;antibacterial&#x27; on the label, I buy all kinds of flavors - spring water, mountain fresh, whatever they have on the market.</li>
