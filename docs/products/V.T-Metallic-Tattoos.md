<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are so cute! The designs really stand out and they lat a long time. Best temporary tatoos on amazon!</li>
    <li> great and arrived fast!</li>
    <li> Shipped super fast! Good quality and easy to apply. Got lots of compliments :)</li>
    <li> Love them!&lt;br /&gt;Great customer Service, too!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re indecisive on what kind of tattoo you want get these! It&#x27;s temporary, sexy and shiny!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Quick shipping, good price.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend.</li>
    <li> Good quality! Fast shipping!So many wonderful tattoos that are really very nice and fashionable!!!</li>
    <li> These are great it is a wonderful item. I had a party that I went to last night that was kind of fancy so I dressed in a fancy dress the sleeves were out of it and I put the tattoos on my upper back and on my one arm and it looked like I had real tatoo and I got many compliments on how nice they looked on me and where did I get it done.  I told them they weren&#x27;t real and where to go to find them because they wanted them I am going to get more too. Thanks for making such a great product.</li>
    <li> Just as expected.  Beautiful colors and metallics.  Easy to apply.  Highly recommended for personal use or especially for party favors.  We used ours at a bridal shower and they were a huge hit.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, everything as advertised.</li>
    <li> I ordered these metallic tattoos for a my belly dance troupe&#x27;s spring showcase.  They were a big hit !  Everyone loved them and they looked awesome with my costume.  I wore them in my feet, hands, arms and belly.  The quality is really good, the tattoos barely chipped and they stayed in my body for about 3 showers, which was not a problem because they made a great accessory for my day and night outfits.  Overall great product.</li>
    <li> These are awesome and really fashionable. These metallic tattoos are perfect for a night out or a day on the beach. I had so many compliments! Everyone wanted to know where i got them! I was so suprised at the value. I have seen &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; brands of these tattoos that retail for way more and you get way less product, so these are a steal!!! I am happy to recieve these items to review. They are super cool! I love rockin&#x27; them!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and lasted 3-4 days with showers and workouts. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> There are SO MANY fun metallic tattoos in this package. They are great quality and work very well; I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised! If I am ever in need of metallic tattoos again or if anyone else I know wants them, then I will definitely be recommending these.</li>
    <li> easy to put on skin, but of course don&#x27;t expect it to last very long</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a tattoo but could never think of anything that I wanted on my body FOREVER! So these cool Venus Metallic Tattoos were the perfect solution. They were so easy to apply. Just cut out a tattoo or tattoos that you like, remove the clear piece of paper, apply anywhere on your body that you want the tattoo to go and apply a damp cloth over it. You don&#x27;t need to hold the damp cloth over it for too long and once you&#x27;re done, just peel the paper back and presto - you have a tattoo! I had my hubby put a couple on me. He made a really cool design out of the peacock feathers. They&#x27;ve been on all day &amp; still look like he just put them on me. I love them!</li>
    <li> These are a cute altenative to a real tattoo. They can also work in place of jewelry. All you need is a damp towel to apply. I made the mistake of using a wet towel. If they are over moistened, they will not stick appropriately. As you can see in the picture, I seriously made that mistake this was also after a couple days wear. It was rather easy to remove. I just used a warm damp towel and rubbed it away. It stayed in place for about 4 days. I will continue to experiment with these tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion. All views and opinions are 100% my own and have neither been paid for nor sponsored.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these tattoos. You may be wondering if they are actually as attractive in person as the are on the sheet or on the model, but they are actually so much more attractive in person and the sheets are larger than you think where the bands are about and inch wide and at least 10 inches long, so the company isn&#x27;t skimping out at all. And really, there are 6 sheets that covered 15 people for an event I was hosting. If I had any comment, I&#x27;d say that they stay on VERY well and don&#x27;t come off super easily in the shower, but they look so great that I haven&#x27;t minded wearing mine around for a day or two. I just didn&#x27;t want to scrub hard. These will still shine beautifully after any activity.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and they look great!  Everything I expected the product to be.</li>
    <li> These are so fun! I keep seeing metallic tattoos in magazines and everywhere as trendy but hadn&#x27;t given much thought to them until last week when I saw someone wearing one on their face at the goth club. It was so cool I just had to give them a shot. These are so much fun and gorgeous. There are so many varieties in this pack, I included tons of photos, because I wanted to be certain that you could see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are bright and shiny with clean lines, and so easy to apply. They apply just like the temp tatts I played with as a kid, because they are basically the same thing. Just cut out the one you want, remove the plastic coating, place where you want and put a wet towel over it for 15 or 30 seconds until the paper pulls away cleanly and leaves the image behind. Too easy!&lt;br /&gt;I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> The tattoos go on easily. And the metallic colors show up nicely on varying skin tones. I wore mine on a hot day outside and was sweating and re-applying sunscreen. By the end of the day the tattoo had worn off a little and was a little sticky. The tattoos on areas that did not get sunscreen and sweaty are looking good still.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase and quality.</li>
    <li> These will last a long time (my daughter couldn&#x27;t wash them off easily after her performance.) I suppose that is a great thing if you are looking for a long lasting temporary tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly and in great shape.</li>
    <li> So fun! I love these!</li>
    <li> I only received 4 sheets.  Please send the additional two.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, awesome design!</li>
    <li> I was very happy to receive this item to review since I have never tried it before.I have never seen metallic tattoos before. These are totally cool. They come in tons of beautiful designs and are easy to apply. They are a much higher quality than your regular temporary tattoos. I&#x27;m going to have lots of fun with these!</li>
    <li> I just received this, pulled it out of the package immediately and started applying them to my niece. She LOVES them! There is so many different designs she can choose from. We just decided that we will have to have her girlfriends over to put some tattoos on them as well. This is a big hit for girl in this area around 10 years old, so I struck gold when I gave these to her. Also, they are so easy to apply! Great job, great variety, great quality tattoo! I highly recommend this for any girls looking to decorate their skin with a temporary look and not a real one. :)</li>
    <li> These are really pretty, easy to apply and are soo cool!!!  I thought they would look really cheap and was kinda hesitant but when I received them I thought they were pretty.  Once I applied them on my granddaughter they are beautiful I am very impressed!!  They do not bubble like most temp tattoo&#x27;s, they are easy to apply, and are really shiny.. High quality tattoo&#x27;s.. Very impressive..</li>
    <li> They were great for our event!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for the the sole purpose of applying them to my family and myself during our cruise! It was a blast and we &#x27;tattooed&#x27; everyone who happened to walk by and liked and wanted one. Including a 95 year old woman in a wheelchair!</li>
    <li> These patterns are great! People kept complimenting our tattoos and asking where we got them. They lasted a long while too!</li>
    <li> These were nice quality and a nice selection. I would definitely order them again.</li>
    <li> The designs in this set are lovely and the application process was a piece of cake. These are just like those temporary tattoos you used to get in the gumball machines as a kid. I was intrigued with the flash tattoo trend and thought this would be cute for summertime trips to the beach, picnics or other outdoor activities. I tried a few designs out on my fingers but they&#x27;ve barely lasted 24 hours. To be fair, obviously I&#x27;m doing a lot with my hands but I was hoping to get a least more than a day&#x27;s worth of wear. I&#x27;m sure on wrists and other areas of the body the designs will last longer. The necklace designs will probably look great on thinner, less busty girls but I have a wide chest and think these will probably look small and silly on me. The designs are still super fun and I love wearing it. I&#x27;ll probably order more to last me through the summer!</li>
    <li> These temporary tattoos are simply beautiful!  I love the shiny, metallic flare they have, they especially look great with a tan.  The set comes with 6 full pages of tattoos, so there is sure to be something to please everyone.  There are feathers, arrows, tribal bands, and necklaces, just to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;  The tattoos are really easy to apply, just cut out your desired tattoo, place it on your skin where you want it to go, then place a wet warm (not dripping) washcloth over the tattoo for about 30 seconds.  Voila!  You have a very real looking tattoo for the next 2-3 days if you are careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;  Removing it is just as easy, just use rubbing alcohol and it will come right off.  It&#x27;s that easy.&lt;br /&gt;These tattoos are fun and an easy way to dress up an outfit or add a little bling to date night or girls night out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tattoos provided for free by Venus Tattoo.</li>
    <li> my daughter love it, good quality</li>
    <li> quality is OK, but this is a bug inside which is big flaw.</li>
    <li> Not only did the item ship in 4 days, the item is of great quality and lasts two days plus. Im usually skeptical when it comes to online buying because im not so sure as to whom is selling the product or if it is a scam but I promise you will love this item. Also, after receiving the item, I was emailed a personal thank you from the company for my purchase :)</li>
    <li> These tattoos last a long time and will stand up to scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, as pictured. Stays on for several days even with showering and sweating.</li>
    <li> Beautiful product &amp; super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Used them for an Egyptian birthday party and they were a big hit!  Great variety in shapes and uses.  would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have bought quite a few of these on Amazon. They are all pretty much the same thing with different designs. This one falls in the middle of the pack. The designs are nice, but they are pretty much all the same color, whereas some of the other companies have a bunch of different colors. The tattoos do last long though and don&#x27;t chip off like the cheaper brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> Really cute tattoos and great quality! Mine stayed on for two days straight without peeling off, all while I was at the lake and in and out of water and swear ting throughout the day! Would def recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> This is a great set of tattoos!  There are a ton of different designs and they are a very pretty metallic mix of gold and silver. I love the variety of styles and my daughter went crazy over the necklace and bracelet tattoos.  They are very easy to apply and come off onto your skin perfectly every time.  We are having a lot of fun with these tattoos.  They are high quality and have stayed flawlessly on our skin for several days.  They apply in seconds.  Just cut out your desired design, peel off clear plastic film and place tattoo face down on skin.  Then gently wet the paper side with a wet paper towel until soaked through and remove the paper.  You get a perfect tattoo every time.  You will not be disappointed in this product.  I received these tattoos complimentary during a promotion for trial and review purposes.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Great shipping! Great customer service! Thank you!</li>
    <li> These are so easy to apply and have now lasted almost a full week!  Order came fast as it was a Prime item.  The only thing i wish was included was just a brief instruction sheet.  I had to go online to read  how to apply.</li>
    <li> loved it! Easy to use, easy to transfer. Fun and FULL COLOR</li>
    <li> My GF loved them. They were her favorite patternes and colors which made this an easy choice for me.</li>
    <li> Designs are really really cool,I loved all the designs except for may be 2 or 3 designs.Application was very simple and easy.I loved the shine and clarity of the tattoos.You can go creative and use them the way you desire.The only thing that&#x27;s missing is the instruction on how to use, even though it is no biggie but I think seller should have included it as whenever I get a product it&#x27;s my habit to read how to use and I am sure other people do it too.Overall a very nice product.I got this product for review at no cost.</li>
    <li> I love it. However, I believe it is supposed to last 7 days. Mine came off within 2 days. I was ok with them not lasting too long but they are a great temporary accessory. I have a ton of them and use them for special occasions and on the weekends. It is the summer and they are bomb!</li>
    <li> I saw a black woman at a wedding who had a gold band on her arm and it looked stunning. I tried some and they work well.</li>
    <li> I got these for my granddaughter for doing a review giving my honest opinion on the product.  She loved these!  There is enough in the pack that she can mix and match to her hearts content.  She has made anklets and bracelets and just stuck them on her where ever.  They are easy to apply as long as area is Clean And free of oils of any kind. So far she has had them on for 3 days and still going strong.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Love love love</li>
    <li> I only got 5 sheets in my package :(</li>
    <li> These temporary tattoos are very pretty. The tattoos last for a very short time. I tried the rings, just washing my hands washed it all off, I didn&#x27;t scrub hard over the tattoo. Very disappointing. I tried a star on my toe and that lasted a little longer but i made it a point not to touch it at all. I have gotten other temp tatts that at least last for 5 days. These will wash right off if you touch it with water. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful tattoo designs and LOVE that there are 6 sheets! Really love how the metallic colors pop against my skin and my friends skin of different tones. They&#x27;re like jewelry without having to worry about anything falling off or losing the item. Definitely worth the purchase even though they do rub off pretty quickly (I tried them out at the beach, so with salt water, sand and sunscreen, I&#x27;m not surprised that they rubbed off fairly quickly). My next try will be at Coachella!! These were exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. Again super beautiful designs.</li>
    <li> Great tattoos and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> These are FUN! I bought these as a gift for my 2 girly grandchildren. They have been having a blast playing make believe that they are all grown up. They look good and, of course are NOT permanent. It was nice to give them a gift that made both parent and child happy!!</li>
    <li> We Love Temporary Tattoos here in this house !! I have a 6 yr old Daughter and she loves sporting tattoos lol These are good quality and super easy to use . you really do get a lot of them . there are a ton of different combinations and my daughter loves to pick them out lol . I think these would be great for any age and they are just super fun . I am so happy I received and opportunity to review these tattoos [[ASIN:B00R74SZWC V.T Metallic Tattoos (HUGE 6 SHEETS PACK) - MOST POPULAR DESIGNS (more than 50 tattoos!) - Gold Silver &amp; Black Body Temporary Metallic Tattoos - Bling Inspired - Long Lasting Trendy Tattoo Designs]] you really get a lot and they would make a great gift !! the holidays are just around the corner and they would fit great in a stocking !!!

    <li> same as in picture. came on time and in good condition. easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Bought these fun tattoos for a beach vacation.  Cute, thanks!</li>
    <li> These are great.  I love them.  They arrived right away too.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> These are so much fun. The Temporary Tattoos are placed on the foil in a way that makes it easy to cut them apart any way you want. I have had one on my dominant wrist all day and it has not faded or rubbed off, despite the fact that I am constantly rubbing my wrist against my clothes and laptop. I have even gotten it wet and it hasn&#x27;t smudged or faded at all. The sizes that the tattoos come in make is easy to fit any body part you are looking to accentuate. They are really easy to put on, and move from the foil to the skin quickly, but easily. Most cheap Temporary Tattoos smudge and get a little messed up when transferring them to the skin, but not these ones. They are ideal for anyone looking to add a little fun to your outfit.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> excellent product and amazing service....!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love these temporary tattoos and they came really fast😉</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and last a good amount of time. Perfect accessory to a night out adding the bling without spending the bling. Many different looks to achieve with this set so its very versital with all my outfits.</li>
    <li> These are so cool, Transfers to the skin supers easy and fast, just place the tattoo and pad with a wet towel and enjoy! My teens are super excited, since these tattoos look like jewelry and it wear for at least a week So cute and unique and so many designs to choose from!!! Awesome for kids, teens and grown ups!!!</li>
    <li> These last for days! My kids have had so much fun making bracelets and necklaces from the various designs. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> These are gorgeous lovely tattoos! They are really easy to apply and come with 6 sheets packed with different designs to pick from. Once they are on they look beautiful and shine with your skin. They are easy to apply with just a wet sponge on the back of them. They look gorgeous and really stand out. They last long and stay looking good a lot longer than most temporary tattoos so this is great. I am in love with these tattoos! I received these as a gift to share my experiences while using them.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This is by far the largest varietyof tattoos I&#x27;ve received. Huge is the perfect word for the six sheets of metallic temporary tattoos Received. Metallics are bright and the staying power is very strong be sure not to over moisten them because they really don&#x27;t stick very well it&#x27;ll slide right off your skin. Once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll have some really cool temporary tattoos I love the weather look against my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a review on V. T. Metallic Tattoos (Huge 6 Sheet Pack)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed when these tattoos arrived at my house.  My teenage daughter could not wait to get her hands on them.  She and her friend had fun applying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tattoos were easy to put on.  You simply had to have a dry area. Remove the plastic on the tattoo. Place it on the spot.  Wet it down the tattoo on the spot.  Wait a minute and gently peeled the white paper off.  The tattoo will be on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was like they were putting on jewelry.  There were tons of designs:  necklaces, wrist bracelets, piece, love, infinity, hearts, leaves, and so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was just as easy to take it off with baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and her friend went swimming the next day and still the tattoos remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for an honest unbiased review.  This is 100% my thoughts.</li>
    <li> Fun for my wife and best friend.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Does not come with application instructions but they are easily found on YouTube.</li>
    <li> these are really cute and easy to apply and remove. they come at a great value. you get so many for such a great price. they go on your skin clear, without leaving anything behind which was great. i would definitely recommend them to add a little something extra to a night out.</li>
    <li> Loved the tattoos.  Easy to apply and stay on without flaking off right away.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> These tattoos are so much fun! I was surprised when I opened them and realized how many tattoos were in this pack! There is well over 50 in all shapes and sizes! They are very easy to put on. My daughter who is 11 used these with no help whatsoever. They also last longer than I thought they would. We actually had to remove them with make-up remover after a couple days so that we could try out a new one! It was great to try this product at a promotional price before being offered to the rest of the world! These Venus Tattoos come with a 100% product satisfaction guarantee so you have nothing to worry about!! Go ahead and have some fun with these tattoos!</li>
    <li> These are so much fun! Although they didn&#x27;t come with instructions, plenty of kind reviews include them, as well as my 9 year old- which is exactly right- very easy to apply.  I love the variety of designs and the ability to use them jewelry!&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I would like commend the seller. The day I received these, I also received a very warm and professional email. Now that&#x27;s outstanding customer service and an owner who truly cares about his business!&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for my birthday party, so I don&#x27;t have much occasion to wear them, but I will definitely be buying more to give as gifts. Fantastic product, fantastic seller!</li>
    <li> These Temporary Tattoos are so cool.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take these with me on my cruise..I take lot&#x27;s of jewelry with me but thought these would be great for the beach and setting by the pool.&lt;br /&gt;They are so amazing!! They are so easy to apply and will last you all day. Even if you are in the water or sweating out on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;I like how you get lots of different designs and that you get 6 sheets which is more than you need for a week long vacation.&lt;br /&gt;i used make up remover to take them off as I had brought some with me on the cruise!!&lt;br /&gt;I received these in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Wow these things are cool. Not only are they beautiful looking decor for your body but they last a very long time and you need to pretty much scrub it off if you want to remove it. The plastic edges pretty much dissapear when the tat dries so it looks almost painted on. I loved these and will be buying more for sure.</li>
    <li> I put these temps on my trip to Punta Cana, everyone liked it, girls were stopping me at the pool to ask were I got them. They lasted through hours of sun, pool, and ocean water (I was in punta cana for a week), no problem on my ankles, shoulder blades, wrists. On my fingers and behind my ear they rubbed off very quickly (a day at most) but I wasn&#x27;t surprised or upset since those are oily areas that rub a lot. I was very happy and can&#x27;t wait to use them again in the summer. (FYI if you put them on and then get a good tan, once the tattoo comes off you WILL have a white mark! same as a ring or bracelet you leave on. I didn&#x27;t mind, but just remember that if it&#x27;s going to bother you.)</li>
    <li> These are so cute and so much fun! I ordered these as a sample for review and evaluation and I love them! They are very easy to apply and I love all the design options. Recently I put a design set on the inside of my bicep and on day 3 I could see a tiny bit of wear but it didn&#x27;t really need removed until the end of day 5. I honestly expected these to rub off by the end of the first day so I am very happy with how long they last! I showered as normal but I did try to only wash gently over it with the wash rag. There are endless design possibilities, once you start trying to figure out what you want to use you&#x27;ll see just how many you really get in the pack. I can&#x27;t wait to try out more and I think they make excellent gifts or even cute party favor for a bachelorette party. Overall I am very happy and I love these!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for summertime!&lt;br /&gt;Love all the different designs.</li>
    <li> Well I didn&#x27;t lay eyes in this product but I sent it to my wife and kids as a gift while I&#x27;m OCONUS and wife said they look super cool.</li>
    <li> I love tattoos but I dont want samething for rest of my life so these temporary tattoos are great for me. These come in 6 sheets. Total are more than 50 different trendy tattoo shapes and designs - Necklace, Wrist Bracelet, Piece, Love, Infinity, Hearts, Leaves, Peacock Leaf, Arrows, Wild Heart, Triangles and more. These tattoos are Looks great on all skin types and colors which is a bonus point.&lt;br /&gt;The application of tattoos is easy. First Clean and dry the are on the skin when you want to place the tattoo, then remove plastic transparent layer and place tattoo face down on your skin. Next, take a little cloth/ sponge, soak it in water, and then wet with it the tattoo that is placed on your skin, wait 30 seconds and then gently remove white paper from your skin, and let the tattoo dry in the open air for 1-2 min. Keep in mind do not apply over lotions or oils. The tattoo would last longer if you avoid too much use of water.&lt;br /&gt;They usually last 2-7 days depending on use of water.&lt;br /&gt;These tattoos dont come with a plastic film on your skin. When you put tattoo on the skin, it comes out the exact tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;These are fun to use and gives a trendy &amp; fancy look.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these if you want to get a temporary tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;I received these tattoo in exchange of an unbiased opinion. However Im free to express my thought about it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described! These look great and are a fun way to jazz up a beach day and lasted even with sunscreen and being in and out of the water. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These metallic tattoos would appeal to teenagers and young adults. They are subtle yet distinctive in the sun. It is very easy to use, just like a kid&#x27;s tattoo, but much faster. It takes just a few second and the tattoo is ready to go. I really like the designs of this pack and I&#x27;ll use them to wear to the beach or to go out with my friends. These tattoos can be used as an accessory - a wrist or an arm bracelet, a small tattoo on your wrist, shoulder or back or even as a focal point of your whole outfit. I&#x27;m glad I got a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes and I&#x27;ll be using them a lot. I&#x27;ll also share with my teenage nieces :)</li>
    <li> These tattoos that look like jewelry are a big hit with my 16 year old.</li>
    <li> Beautiful!  I got lots of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 26, and my younger sister (15) and my son (7) also loved them.</li>
    <li> Do these come off when you put sunscreen on?</li>
