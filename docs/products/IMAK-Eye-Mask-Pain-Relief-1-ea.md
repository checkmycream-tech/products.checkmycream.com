<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This mask completely black out all light!  I feels great when I put it in the freezer, but even when I don&#x27;t I love it!  I use it every night.</li>
    <li> I use this to help with my migraines, hangovers and stress!  I just pop it in the freezer for a couple hours and I get some Instant gratification from these pains in my life.  If I am still able to put any additional effort into my well being at this point, I even gently press on the mask around my eyes for a bit of a massage.  Very nice, very simple.  If you wanted you use some essential oils to even further your pampering.  Once my face gets all cold and there isn&#x27;t that oh so great cooling sensation I put the mask on the back of my neck.  How delightful!  I highly recommend to those who love pampering or need extra pain relief from migraines.</li>
    <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t have any trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.  You could say I am a perfect sleeper.  I can fall asleep in the middle of a loud party.  If I am tired I will go to sleep.  So I really bought these out of curiosity.  I&#x27;ve always wondered why people use sleep / eye masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, no more wondering.  I seriously think I may have had my best sleep ever last night!  Even more important, it was bright in my room when I woke and I had no clue until I lifted the mask.  As far as I knew, before I removed the mask, it was 2am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try putting it the freezer just to see what happens, but I get it now. The masks block as much light as possible thus providing  amazing sleep!  I am now a believer.</li>
    <li> This is a great item, I have actually found myself sleeping more during the day with better rest and sometimes even dreams...something typically reserved for nighttime.  Note: the stitching on the eyes is not for visibility, so wearing while driving is greatly discouraged.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the positive reviews on Amazon, and I thought it would help with my intractable headaches. I am not that impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it looses cool in about 10-15 minutes, which is really frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not the worst part. The mask, even when the strap is pulled to loosest setting, is too tight, creating too much pressure on your face, especially if your headaches include sinus pain and pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does however completely block out light.</li>
    <li> I received my eye mask today and immediately placed it in a ziplock bag and into the freezer for a few hours. I just tried it on, and all I can say is WOW!  The cloth is very comfortable, the little beads inside are just right and allow you to form the mask and target more areas around the eyes like your sinuses or you can just leave it  lay directly over your eyes. The elastic strap is a little thin but it is not a flaw in my opinion but rather, helps lessen the tension on your head. After I adjusted the beads how I wanted it to lay on my face, I just laid back  and within just a few minutes, it was feeling awesome, very relaxed and my tired eyes and stuffy sinuses began to feel better very quickly. I felt so relaxed and the mask felt so good that I fell asleep for hours with the mask on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend having this mask as a part of your medical kit! It is versatile, easy to use, extremely comfortable and does exactly what it is meant to do. As far as the thin elastic strap is concerned, if it were to stretch out over time, it would be extremely simple to fix - just stitch on a new piece of elastic ( hand stitch or machine sew if you are crafty) and even a kindergarten student can do that!  This mask is at a great price point and I suggest you give it a try! it works for me!</li>
    <li> I hate the sun beaming in, so it does a great job of blocking out a lot of the light....but it weighs a lot and hard to keep on your face if you sleep anyway but on your back....definitely doesn&#x27;t help with headaches/migraines....</li>
    <li> Love this mask!  It&#x27;s not one of the cheapies that I&#x27;ve bought before.  I actually has some weight to it so when you put it on it presses lightly on your eyes.  Feels sooo good.  It&#x27;s not too cold...just right.</li>
    <li> It works for headaches but not for migraines. It works as a complement with other painkillers. It gives relief and the weight feels really good especially for sinusitis problems.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these in spring 2009 when I started getting severe migraines. This mask is so good I bought a second just recently (fall2010) to have an extra at my boyfriend&#x27;s house. Just leave in the freezer and take it out when you need the cool/darkness. Blocks light very well, and the beads inside make it form to your face so you feel a lot of the cold. Also stays cool for at least half an hour, which is longer than some other masks I have tried. Considering getting a third so I can rotate between two at my apartment and have the extra at my boyfriend&#x27;s. Worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so, it is now May of 2012, I bought two more recently and still love them (now own a total of four). I am not as sold on them staying cool for 30 minutes though. Recently I have noticed needing to flip the mask over after the first 5-10 minutes and then I sometimes flip it again 5-10 minutes after that to keep the coolest parts on my eyes. The bonus for me is I find if I flip them they don&#x27;t get warm for a really long time, I even fall asleep with them on and don&#x27;t notice the warmth for at least an hour or so. I keep the extras in the freezer so I can rotate through them, my boyfriend even knows when I start to get a migraine to go and get me one right away. This mask is my favorite of about 4 different kinds that I have tried. The other ones have been lost to the wind over the years, and these have stuck around. I do have to either tie, staple, sew, or otherwise make the strap a bit tighter to fit my head, but that&#x27;s not too big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still 100% recommend this product, even just to try to make a migraine less terrible.</li>
    <li> I love this mask.  Fits perfectly.  So comfortable even to sleep in.  It has alittle more weight to it than a regular mask due to the beads, but I find the pressure very soothing.  Will buy another for travel.  I just tried it in the refrigerator and it stays cold long enough for me to fall asleep.  It has worked miracles for my headaches and tired eyes.  Feel great!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help ease eye strain.  I also found that this helps ease one into nice naps.</li>
    <li> I work the evening shift and sleep during daylight. This mask is fantastic! The weight reduces eye puffiness and relaxes the eyes.  The mask blocks light much better than other masks i&#x27;ve tried.  The beads inside the mask conform to the shape of your face so it almost feels custom made.</li>
    <li> Great eye mask! Something about the cool beads inside and the heavyness just make it so relaxing. I get headaches a lot and use this to help them go away. I am so happy that I got this! I also sleep really well when I wear this. Sometimes I even sleep a little too long. Ha ha</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask! Now that I have it, I almost don&#x27;t want to go to sleep without it. It is soothing to the eyes and also if you have a headache. It centers the cool pressure around the pain you are experiencing while keeping light completely out.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used this during a migraine, but on a normal headache it provides some comfort and relief.&lt;br /&gt;I really use this in general just for sleeping. It puts a comfortable pressure around your eyes, that kind of helps you focus and relax into good sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I love it at room temp. or cold. Nice relaxation aide and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> So far I have used this just to keep the light out,so I can sleep.  It&#x27;s easy to wear and softly molds your face.  I haven&#x27;t used it for pain relief yet.</li>
    <li> I like te weight of this mask on my face. It seems to help my sinuses. The cloth cover is nice and it stays cold.</li>
    <li> This mask is a God-send, provides near instant migraine or sinus headache relief to rival most drugs on the market.  The weight of the beads combined with the cold instantly takes the edge off the pain.  It fits comfortably and stays put, blocks out all the light.  I like that once the cold starts to wear off, you can flip it over and have the other side against your eyes for longer lasting cold.  I would recommend buying 2 so you can trade them out in your freezer.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> keeps my husband asleep longer so he gets a better nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;it is Comfortable on the face and head</li>
    <li> I work 12 hour night shifts and sleeping during the day, especially in a room without black out curtains is near impossible, before getting this mask I was able to sleep a max of 4 hours straight, then I&#x27;d toss and turn for the rest of my sleeping time. Since this mask I sleep 6-8 hours and wake up refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable to wear, even for a side and stomach sleeper such as myself. I have recommended this mask to my co-workers and quite a few are going to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love it so much! I put it in the freezer, and when I&#x27;m ready for bed I put it on!  It is easy to sleep in, fits great, and keeps cool for a long time!</li>
    <li> This little mask is very soothing. It&#x27;s too heavy to wear all night, but it is great for soothing head and eyes.</li>
    <li> I have struggled over the years trying to find a good eyemask for sleeping.  This has been the best, by far.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after having migraines 3x a week for two months. Nothing helped except wrapping my head in a pillow. I needed the pressure on my head and THIS WORKS! The weight of this eye mask isn&#x27;t over the top, but it&#x27;s just enough to let you know it&#x27;s there. And being able to put it in the freezer is awesome!    My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the way that the mask hits across my nose puts a little too much pressure on my sinuses so I don&#x27;t use it when I&#x27;m not having a migraine.</li>
    <li> Great mask, comfortable, exactly as advertised but the elastic band is very flimsy. Wanted something to use as a sleep mask but this one, as good as it is doesn&#x27;t look like the band will last a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updating this review, the mask lasted for a few months. Had eye surgery and it helped a lot during recovery but recently gave out. Will buy another since I&#x27;m looking at further surgery and the massaging action really does help.</li>
    <li> So far (one month in) so good. I use this eye-pillow every night. Does not compress my eyes. My only concern is perhaps the elastic headband may \\&quot;overstretch\\&quot; and lose its elasticity rather quickly. No qualms yet but that may be an issue. Other than that, I highly recommend this eye mask. Helps alleviate sinus pain. Inner gel beads feel cool and refreshing on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mask one evening after taking Advil in the morning, two Alleve in the afternoon, and still getting no relief from a headache concentrated in my forehead.  I get migraines but the headache I had wasn&#x27;t a migraine so I didn&#x27;t want to waste a prescription migraine pill on this headache.  The weather has been cold and rainy so I wanted an \\&quot;eye mask\\&quot; I could heat and put over my eyes and forehead as opposed to the kind of cold mask that seems to help some people having migraines.    I read a review of a LOT of different eye masks on Amazon before picking this one.  I particularly liked that it was sewn in such a way as to avoid putting a lot of pressure on the eyes.   What I didn&#x27;t notice was that none of the reviews of this one said anything about microwaving it.  A number of the eye masks I read about DID allow for freezing or microwaving.    When this mask arrived the next day I put it in the microwave as soon as I got home, found the Amazon box on my doorstep, and opened the package.    MISTAKE!  Though NEITHER THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION ON AMAZON NOR THE PACKAGING STATE SO, THIS SHOULD NOT BE MICROWAVED! To be fair, there is nothing saying that it CAN be microwaved but given what happened when I microwaved it, and the fact that many of these products can be chilled or heated, I think the packaging should have a warning about this and the product description should also.  When I removed it from the microwave the beads inside the fabric nearly burned my fingers AND there was a bad chemical odor in the microwave.  I am letting it sit out on the counter for a few days and then will put it in a freezer bag, then into the freezer, as instructed on the package. I have now ordered two other masks from Amazon to try - and both of them explicitly state in the descriptions that they can be heated.    I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars due to the failure of the seller to make clear that it cannot be microwaved.  Other than that I like it - the size, shape and weight.  Please note that though this mask can be washed, the cover is NOT removable.  If you want one with a removable, washable fabric cover this is not one of those.</li>
    <li> This is simply a wonderful product.  Nothing, and I mean nothing, is more relaxing that using this on your face.  I suffer from chronic sinusitis, headaches, and eye strain--this soothes them all!  It&#x27;s too bad it can&#x27;t permanently stay cool though!</li>
    <li> This is the best non-medicinal treatment I have for my headaches.  I dont think I could sleep as well without it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM:  I purchased two of these masks for myself and husband assuming they had a large coverage area as is seemingly shown in the photo; (person must have a small head), however, the masks are not that big, are very heavy with beads or whatever is inside, and the only band to hold it on is a very thin and narrow elastic that is not adjustable at all.  Totally unlike my dollar store masks which have a large adjustable band.  So, if you want to lie any way except flat on your back, you cannot keep it on.  You cannot lie on your side or sit up because it falls off.  Now, here is where I am really pissed off.  They show free shipping, but if you want to return the item, they not only make you pay for the return postage, but they also deduct the initial shipping cost (who knows how much that will be, as it is usually way more than the actual cost to ship out)off your potential refund money.  THEN, they charge you a 20% RESTOCK FEE, which is absurd.  TOTALLY SCREWING YOU.  They probably have some joe opening the mail and tossing the item into a bucket to go back on a shelf...All they will tell you upon requesting a refund is that this was the policy...unfortunately, I have never run into a policy like this before and who knows how much out of my $25 dollars plus, they will actually give me back.  Stay away from this company...find a better product out of the many others.</li>
    <li> I have had migraines since I was a young girl and have tried various things to relieve the pain and discomfort.  I have used eye pillows for many years to apply pressure to my eyes which seems to give some relief.  I saw this on Amazon.com and decided to try it.  I must say I am very pleased for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is black and you don&#x27;t have to worry about mascara (or anthing else) staining it.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It is cool and weighted so well that the small amount of pressure is just the right amount.  You can also switch sides and the other remains cool.&lt;br /&gt;3.  You can put it in the freezer to get colder if desired but I have not had the need to do that.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Very importantly it has an elastic strap so that you can wear it while sleeping and not be concerned with it falling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been so pleased that I sent one to my daughter who suffers from migraines and just purchased another for a friend who has migraines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Recently saw my friend and she was raving about how wonderful this is for migraines!  She wanted to know where she could buy another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are wonderful and I keep mine beside my bed at all times.  They are also great for blocking out light.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is great for keeping out light and relieving minor sinus and headache pain. Even though the strap is adjustable and stretchy, I find that the mask slides off my face because I am a &#x27;toss &amp; turner&#x27; type sleeper. I wake up in the middle of the night usually on top of this mask or its on the floor. It definitely helps me fall asleep but rarely stays on through the night.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask to get relief from my seasonal allergies.  When frozen, the mask relieves some of the discomfort associated with my sinuses as well as relief for the area around my eyes, which are very itchy and get swollen.  Most eye masks fall off during the night, but this is the only one that stays put - - regardless of how much tossing and turning I do throughout the night.  Also, as others have pointed out, this mask is the best for blocking out the light, and using this mask for taking a nap during the day has been wonderful.    Some of the reviews have complained that they found this mask too heavy.  While this mask is definitely the heaviest I have ever used, I find the heaviness comforting.  (And it really is not THAT heavy).  When the mask is frozen, having the cool weight press over my sinuses and my eyes feels very relaxing.  The outer material is wonderfully soft and the beads on the inside conform perfectly to my face.</li>
    <li> I use this eye mask for just about everthing--after my Lasik surgery, to simple relaxation! This is a great, high quality mask at a good price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, well made.  It provides comfort because it is soft and thick and conforms to the contours of the face, and it can be chilled in the freezer to provide cooling relief, but remains soft and pliable.  Of course it is not a miracle cure but it works as advertised.  Our first one eventually wore thin in spots so that the little beads leaked out, but it lasted several years.</li>
    <li> I get migraines when the barometric pressure drops - and sometimes my prescription medicine (Imitrex) won&#x27;t even touch them. This comfortable mask blocks out light very well. It has an elastic so that I can even lie on my side. The beads in the mask are tiny and just heavy enough that they provide a nice pressure around my eyes and the top of my nose. And the fact that I can put it in the freezer is an added bonus: the cold feels terrific! The mask doesn&#x27;t, in fact, stay cold as long as I&#x27;d like - but I don&#x27;t see any way around that problem, short of actual ice, which I think would be too cold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several eye masks through my days, such as the gel ones, or the nice bean bag aromatherapy ones.  This one trumps them all.  I have a very wide face and finding a pair of eye mask that can securely fit around my big head has been very difficult to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first when I purchased my IMAK.  It said \\&quot;ergobeads\\&quot; and I thought it was a fancy word for bean bag.  After wearing this for a few minutes I can tell this eye mask was different.  The stitching around the eye area is superb.  It fits perfectly around the eyes without giving it too much pressure.  The fabric is also very gentle and soft without feeling overly fuzzy or rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use the head strap or without.  With the head strap it blocks out ALL light completely.  My husband can be up all night reading a book and I wouldn&#x27;t even know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my IMAK eye mask for 2 months now.  I wear it every night for about 15 minutes before I go to sleep.  Once I&#x27;m half awake I take it off.  Just doing this has helped to alleviate a lot of pressure in my eyes and sinus areas when I wake up in the morning.  If I have time, I would put this on for an additional 15 minutes or so in the morning to help get rid of all my sinus pressure around my forehead and eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting this mask has made my mornings so much better.  I used to have pop an Advil Cold &amp; Sinus just to relieve sinus pressure, now I don&#x27;t have to.  I&#x27;m in front of the computer a lot while I&#x27;m at work and at home, so this mask has been amazing in relieving my discomfort.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavier than I liked but the stitching for the eyelid area is great as it keeps the mask from pressing on the eyeball itself. I&#x27;ve used it as a sleep mask mostly. Would&#x27;ve liked for the elastic to be a bit wider and sturdier. Feels flimsy and can allow the mask to slip some when turning over in bed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mask (or one just like it) years ago. Unfortunately, my dog \\&quot;ate\\&quot; it and I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything like it since...until now. This is the best mask for easing my migraine suffering. I&#x27;ve tried other masks since losing my first one, but none come close to providing the relief this mask does. The weight provides perfect pressure to cheeks, forehead and around the eyes. Light is completely blocked. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a sleeping mask, as it won&#x27;t stay put when rolling over. I highly recommend it for headache sufferers, though.</li>
    <li> I do like this mask, but there are a few serious problems with it and with the claims made in its marketing materials.  PROBLEMS WITH THIS PRODUCT...  This mask doesn&#x27;t get very cold, particularly compared with a traditional gel pack or especially compared with an ice bag. Even when comparing it with other eye masks such as gel-pack based ones, and not with a colder ice bag, it just doesn&#x27;t ever get as cold in the freezer. Further, it loses its cold before too long, all too quickly based on what I need from it, although all freezer-based cold items do that. If you want it for the purpose of applying cold to your eye area, it might let you down. Certainly, other options would be more effective for that purpose alone.  Another problem is that this IMAK mask DOES NOT \\&quot;MASSAGE\\&quot; YOU AT ALL! That wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if it were not claimed by the seller than it does. The marketing materials of the seller when I bought this mask and as of at least the date of this review, 1/25/12, state FALSELY that the beads sewn into the padding will massage you. They do nothing of the sort. They don&#x27;t move at all (and they don&#x27;t \\&quot;glide\\&quot; against your skin, as the ad copy claims), and thus there&#x27;s no \\&quot;massaging effect\\&quot; as the ad copy claims. It seems ridiculous to me that the marketing claims on the Amazon.com page here as of this review claim that these beads and this nonexistent \\&quot;massaging effect\\&quot; increase blood circulation and promote healthy muscle tissue. That&#x27;s what the page says as of this review. But unless any object against your skin has those effects, it doesn&#x27;t seem likely at all to me given that it just rests against your skin and doesn&#x27;t move. And if any object has those effects, then it&#x27;s misleading to insinuate that it&#x27;s this mask in particular that does so.  Again, there are no moving parts. Massage and gliding are action verbs that imply or overtly claim motion. That sure seems like false advertising to me, although I don&#x27;t know if it fits a formal legal definition of \\&quot;false\\&quot; or not. Lawyers and laws can often create odd and counter-logical definitions of things. It&#x27;s just how it very clearly comes across after trying the product, and given my lay knowledge of mechanics, the definitions of words such as \\&quot;massage\\&quot; and \\&quot;glide\\&quot; (verbs implying movement), and lay knowledge of physiology. While I don&#x27;t have research to back up my assumption that these are inflated and misleading claims for certain and at the very least, and even most likely outright false claims (possibly knowingly), I would bet the manufacturer and marketing people behind these claims ALSO have no real research to back up such claims of benefits from the plastic beads.  Of course, as with any object, you could massage yourself using this eye pad between your hands and your skin. That would massage you, but it wouldn&#x27;t be the beads or pad doing it. That&#x27;s like saying a shirt massages you just because someone massages your shoulders while you&#x27;re wearing that shirt. The truth is that the beads DO feel good during movement IF AND ONLY IF YOU DO THE WORK by massaging yourself or if someone else does it for you (the latter not being so desirable around your eyes, I&#x27;d expect). The pad and beads will not massage you by themselves, not even a tiny bit. I tried in desperation to figure out what the advertising claims were talking about with their talk of massage, and thus I did move the eye pad around with my hands and stumble upon this feeling. It felt good doing that, and the beads add to that effect. If you plan to move the pad around manually while sitting or lying there, then you might like the feeling of the beads as I do.  But be aware and clear about the fact that you&#x27;ll only feel it during the moments you&#x27;re moving the eye pad around actively, and you can&#x27;t move it very far since its form-fitted to an eye area and goes around your nose, thus limiting its range of movement. Plus, note that you&#x27;re not going to feel like moving the eye pad around manually most of the timeyou&#x27;d be wearing this, so this feature wouldn&#x27;t be useful most of the time. Indeed, it would make no difference at all whether or not there were beads in the thing unless and while you were moving it actively.  I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any valid reason for this company to say false or misleading claims in trying to sell this mask, even if immoral and unethical profit-seeking was considered a \\&quot;valid\\&quot; reason. It&#x27;s just not good business to deceive one&#x27;s customers and arouse distrust in your company&#x27;s claims. Why not take the more long-term profitable path of creating justifiable trust and more loyal repeat customers, as well as the moral high ground, in their quest for maximum profit if their product is valuable?  ON THE POSITIVE SIDE...  This mask is very comfortable. It does feel good to wear. The cloth surface and padded feeling are very nice. Plus, WHEN you feel like actually moving the pad around with your hands, that feels very nice due to the beads in it.  A nice thing about the beads is that they allow the surface area to be shaped to your face nicely. They are small, so you can press down on the eye pad after first putting it on, thus making for better contact between the eye pad and your skin than most pads would allow.  With respect to its cooling abilities, while it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as cold as gel pack masks or ice bags, it does feel cool in a subtle way at first if well-frozen long enough in the freezer. Also, the cooling effect INCREASES OVER TIME in my experience. Thus, while it doesn&#x27;t feel very cold at first when I put it on, and I was disappointed when first doing so, after a while the coolness builds up around my eye areas and it feels much cooler then. It also relieves pain much better after it has this built-up cooling effect.  Thus, if you try this mask, be sure it&#x27;s well-cooled in your freezer, and then wear it at least 5 minutes before making a decision about how much you like it. The first time you put it on, don&#x27;t be discouraged if itdoesn&#x27;t come close to what you&#x27;re used to using to cool your eye areas (it most likely won&#x27;t compare at first). You&#x27;re likely to appreciate it more after you&#x27;ve been wearing it long enough to get the maximum effect from its cooling properties.  I suppose I&#x27;m glad I bought this mask, as it is very comfortable and the cooling effect, while subtle and milder than most masks and of limited duration, is effective at alleviating pain just about enough to make it worth using.  ON THE DOWN SIDE...  As with any such mask, it can&#x27;t regain its coldness quickly enough in the freezer to come close to matching how quickly it loses its cool. To be able to wear one of these IMAK masks very long in one continuous stretch or very much in a longer period of time (such as an afternoon or day), you&#x27;d have to have a number of them in the freezer. Given that they aren&#x27;t small, that&#x27;s not only a burden to buy, but also a sacrifice of freezer space you might not want to give up. I know I don&#x27;t have enough room to spare to put as many of these in the freezer as I&#x27;d need to be able to keep a cool one on my eyes long enough to come close to matching the duration that my large ice bag will stay cold. Plus, if I wanted fairly continuous use, I might have to buy a dozen or more of them and keep rotating them, placing a cold-expended one back in the freezer as soon as I replaced it with a fresh cold one. I didn&#x27;t do the math and time how long it takes for the cold to be expended per pad, so I don&#x27;t exactly how many you&#x27;d need for that. The point is just that they don&#x27;t hold the cold too long, yet you can&#x27;t practically have enough of them cold all the time to be able to use them a whole lot without a large outlay of money and freezer space, as well as the time investment in going back and forth to the kitchen to get a new one and put the spent one back all the time.  BOTTOM LINES...  Still, the first of two \\&quot;bottom lines\\&quot; for me is that the mask is cheap enough and feels good enough to make it worth having one.  Yet another bottom line for me that almost makes me rate it one star and refuse to do any business with the company ever again (which I still might choose for the following reason) is that the marketing materials in my opinion make outright false claims. At the very least, the claims are extremely misleading. I find this to be very immoral as well as unethical. Less important, it&#x27;s just plain embarrassing as a human being (I hope aliens don&#x27;t see this dark side of humanity!) and as a person living in a capitalist culture (USA) that I&#x27;d love to be nothing but happy with and proud of (although, ironically, this product is made in China). I don&#x27;t like to encourage or support with my money the profitability of immoral and unethical practices, and I fear writing a review that could lead to others doing so with their money. However, I won&#x27;t sink to that level and only present the down sides of this product, because it does have some TRUE value.  I suppose that I can only suggest that if you try this mask and don&#x27;t find that it \\&quot;massages\\&quot; you, that you let the company know and/or let other potential buyers know as I&#x27;ve done in this review, that you don&#x27;t feel the claims are valid and you don&#x27;t support the practice of making invalid claims. There&#x27;s no acceptable excuse or justification for companies, marketers, or salespeople making false claims or misrepresenting their product as I feel is done here. No truly useful or valid product should have any need for them anyway.  Thus, while I&#x27;m tempted to give it the lowest score just so as to call attention to my review so that others may be accurately warned of misleading claims, and to inhibit misrepresentation in marketing and the immorality it represents, the product gets 2 stars from me in this review. Objectively, it doesn&#x27;t live up to the claims of the marketing, and thus is less than \\&quot;okay\\&quot; (which is the word equivalent of a 3-star score). If I hold the product not to MY self-created expectations, but justto the standards of THE SELLER&#x27;S claims, then I can&#x27;t in good conscience rate it as better than less than \\&quot;okay\\&quot; and thus 2 stars. If all the information presented were accurate and not inflated, false, or misleading, I&#x27;d rate it 4 or maybe even 5 stars for being very comfortable to wear and very affordable. Plus, I find that most other eye masks are not very comfortable or useful, even if they might get more cold and hold the cold longer.  [[ASIN:B000VHYLFW IMAK Eye Mask, Pain Relief 1 ea]]</li>
    <li> better than I expected- soft and fits well over my cheeks and forehead. other masks just cover eyes and I need more for sinus relief. highly recommend this- worth every penny and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> the Velcro stretched to the point it doesn&#x27;t fit on your head no more so you cant use it other then lying on your back.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is very easy to use. very good cooling and relief of eyes.could be a relief eye mask or be a sleep eye pad. It&#x27;s not very light as usual. you can feel a little weight when it&#x27;s on your eyes which very well gives you a massage on your eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask trying to take the place of one I had and lost. That mask was a good enough that I remembered it years later, and I was thrilled to find out this one is even better. Just the right weight on your face, doesn&#x27;t push on your eyes, great seal for the light. Sleeping so much better! If you like a beanbag type mask you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> you can freeze it or just use it as is.  it is great for sleeping, as it keeps light out and makes your headaches feel better.  i use it every night.</li>
    <li> This mask works the BEST!! Stick it in the freezer and then wear it. Makes your head feel great. Love this thing.</li>
    <li> This mask is perfect in almost every way. Its gentle weight is soothing. No--no--light gets in.  When it is cooled it is like refreshing eye-facial. There could be none better for the plane or train or that afternoon lie-down. Face up.  But when you turn your head to the side its weight wants to pull it down, just a little, just enough to notice and wake you up. If you start on your side and don&#x27;t move, no worries. I will always have one for travel and my afternoon nap.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who can&#x27;t sleep with any bit of visible light, so I bought this to use during an overnight flight to Europe. I figured the extra weight around the eyes would help keep it as dark as possible so that I can sleep easier. Completely unrelated, I suffer from chronic headaches, occasional sinus issues and anxiety. This mask is awesome! It not only makes everything pitch black, it also soothes my headache (mostly on the temples) like only a good massage can. I have yet to stick it in the freezer, but it feels fantastic at room temperature. It puts light pressure on my under eyes as it alleviates sinuses, and I&#x27;m hoping it helps with my incessant under eye circles and morning puffiness. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work well for meditation exercises, as it helps calm the head and the mind.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it! Totally worth it for ten bucks.</li>
    <li> It does not conform to your face, nor does it retain much of its temperature if you put it in the freezer. But for the price it was an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very happy because my wife is very happy.  It fits great and now my late night TV watching doesn&#x27;t bother her.  Maybe saved a marriage? Probably not, but great product anyway.</li>
    <li> This mask is excellent if your looking for a software material that conforms to your facial features and blocks out all sources of light; however, if your looking to have something that you can heat up and have it HOLD the heat for more than a couple minutes...look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This mask is NOT for average eye-stress relief and will have AFTER-EFFECTS.    I&#x27;m a casual user that does not experience migraines and has not had eye-surgery.    Using this mask (in it&#x27;s cold state) for the first time, my head is still feeling strange from all the cold that it absorbed 3 hours after I took the mask offf. Again, not recommended unless you have a serious reason for wanting this type of therapy.    I haven&#x27;t yet tried it&#x27;s merits in a non-cold state, but I imagine that the cold feature would be the only reason to buy this.</li>
    <li> If you have migraines this is the mask for you.  I suffer from migraines all the time &amp; this mask has been a great help.  It puts just the right amount of pressure around your eyes &amp; the cool beads really help soothe the throbbing pain.  Its really comfortable whether you are lying on your back or on your side &amp; the strap fits perfectly w/out feeling too tight behind my ears.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter-in-law who suffers migraines on a daily basis.  Having had them all her life she claims only surgery will help.  She felt the eye pillows are good for her in the morning to cover her eyes from piercing daylight, however the beads do not retain the cold very long.  I have tried this myself for mild headaches and find it soothing.</li>
    <li> good eye mask, keeps my eyes closed and you can put this the freezer for &amp;#34;cool eyes&amp;#34;  Had to re sew the band tighter.</li>
    <li> I love that this mask is weighted and tends to have a cool feeling when first putting it on for the night. The only issue I have had with this product is that the elastic band tends to stretch out over time and not hold as well as when new.</li>
    <li> I am a flight attendant and have a wacky work schedule. I frequently have to sleep during the day. These are SO comfortable and cool as well. I have ordered and tried out at least 10 eye-masks off of Amazon and have found these to be the best. They are SO comfortable and do not have velcro on the straps, for which I am thankful, because I usually sleep on my back and am sensitive to the thickness of eyemasks which have the velcro straps.</li>
    <li> Product fits great....what happens when the elastic starts to stretch out..is the company going to send replacements?  Bought 3  1-bed;  1- recliner/tv;  1- freezer.  Does the company even read these?</li>
    <li> Good product but a bit thicker than I thought it would be.  It also slips off very easily if it isn&#x27;t fitted just right.  I have found that if I make it a bit too tight at first, throughout the night it loosens.  Overall though, good product and good value.  I love the heat and cool options!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.Sufficient space for eye movements after wearing&lt;br /&gt;2.&#x27;Chilled&#x27; feeling is awesome before falling asleep(after removing from refrigerator)&lt;br /&gt;3.comfortable strap (not too harsh, not too slippery)&lt;br /&gt;4.More width for more protection from light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Comes to room temperature soon. But I feel like it still deserves 5 stars, because after a while..it comes to room temperature &amp; NOT MORE thank that (in contradiction to few reviews)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral: This is the best thing I have got after trying various brands..Perfect for me !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of migraines lately so I&#x27;ve been looking for ways to help when I get them and I came along this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye mask is absolutely wonderful and definitely helps me feel better until my Excedrin kicks in or I fall asleep. It&#x27;s also great even when I don&#x27;t have a migraine.</li>
    <li> Amazing for headaches, nasal congestion, and sleep - I keep it on the freezer and use it often -  thanks</li>
    <li> I got this mask for my wife, who suffers from regular migranes.  It&#x27;s stuffed with a bead-like substance and can be placed in the fridge, so that it offers cool comfort at the onset of a migrane or headache.  One day I was playing around with it and tried it on.  I must say that it was REALLY comfortable and didn&#x27;t let any light through at all.  It&#x27;s actually designed in such a way that I could open my eyes while wearing it and still be comfortable and in total darkness.  I liked it so much, I ordered one for myself.  I often use it in conjunction with some awesome ear plugs I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon [[ASIN:B0013A0C0Y Howard Leight MAX1 Earplugs Uncorded NRR33 Box/200 Count]] for a totally comfortable, quiet sleep experience.</li>
    <li> I love this! So glad I bought it. It blocks out the light and not too heavy on the face but helps \\&quot;soothe\\&quot; the eye area. I like how it doesn&#x27;t put too much weight on the eye area as well.&lt;br /&gt;This should come in handy when I visit Alaska in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I freeze this product and use it (along with meds) when I feel a migraine coming on.&lt;br /&gt;Favorite features -&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other cold masks, this one DOES NOT pick up odors from the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;When it gets warmer, you can flip it over.</li>
    <li> Honestly, overall I am very satisfied with this product. The only thing I can say about it is that I wish it was a little heavier and I wish it stayed cold longer. I mean it&#x27;s still pretty heavy and gives you pressure as far as eye masks go, but it could stand to be a little heavier. And that&#x27;s just my opinion; I like A LOT of pressure. Aain, overall I&#x27;m satisfied and I consider it a good buy!</li>
    <li> I put this sleep mask in the freezer for two hours (though i sometimes make the mistake of going overboard and leave it in half the day) and when i put it on and allergy problems and/or headaches i&#x27;ve developed throughout the day dissapear.&lt;br /&gt;As for using it to sleep with I can see absolutely Nothing out of it. No light seeps through whatsoever. At first it was a bit heavy but I eithier got used to it or it turned out ok but eithier way it feels great about 1 1/2 weeks in.</li>
    <li> Honestly the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made on Amazon.  I wish I owned 10 of these.  I suffer from chronic migraines, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens of cold packs, eye masks, neck pillows, you name it....nothing has ever come close to the IMAK mask.  Even on good days, when I&#x27;m blessedly pain-free, this mask is amazing for sleeping -- the gentle pressure of the soft beads feels so soothing on your eyes, and it blocks out every single bit of light, so you sleep more soundly than you can imagine.  I recently took it with me on a weekend trip and used it on the plane and to help me sleep in the hotel; both of which are usually difficult for me.  If you have even the slightest doubt about ordering this, please don&#x27;t hesitate.  I do agree with other reviewers that the strap is a bit loose, but it hasn&#x27;t been an issue so far.  I can&#x27;t say enough good about this mask!  Buy two so you can keep one in the freezer to rotate!</li>
    <li> too big and too heavy, every time you turn it moves because is too thick, good idea but did not work for me and my wife</li>
    <li> Molds around your eyes to block out light, and you can refrigerate it to reduce puffy eyes. I need this primarily for migraine relief. I have tried eye masks made from memory foam, but this one is superior.  I would change is the length of the strap, but I have a really big head, so it would probably be great for 60 % of the population. Also, the tiniest bit of light comes in at the stitching over the eyes, crucial for migraine relief is total light blocking. these two things are easily fixed, so all in all I am very happy with this. I will get some for my migraine prone bff&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> These are great gift items.  Very soothing when chilled (they can be kept in the freezer with no long term damage) and the comfortable contour and weight around the eye sockets mean you can go to sleep with it on most of the night.  Good for restful naps, too.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, very soothing for migraines and general head pains. I found the coolness sometimes irritated my closed eyes, but raising the mask to my forehead worked in those situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may sound odd, but about 7 weeks ago we bought a juicer ([[ASIN:B000QBFFU8 Breville BJE510XL Ikon 900-Watt Juicer]]) to juice veggies and fruit after seeing the movie, [[ASIN:B004V4ASB2 Fat, Sick, &amp; Nearly Dead]] on Netflix. Since having daily juices, I haven&#x27;t had one migraine. Prior to juicing I was having 4-6 a month, every month, for the last 20 years. No pill, nasal spray, dietary changes, doctor, has helped like juicing so far has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband had bought me the eye mask prior to our juicing experience though, and I can definitely say it did help when I needed it. Hopefully I continue to need it much less than before!</li>
    <li> First, ordered one for myself.  Then the fiance tries it out and tells me \\&quot;This one is mine.  Get your own\\&quot;.  So I ordered another one thinking I&#x27;d better hide it before someone else sees it.  That plan did work until my future brother in law sees my fiance using this mask and told her exactly what she had forced upon me: \\&quot;This one is mine.  Get your own\\&quot;.  Guess what?  Now I&#x27;ve had to order a third IMAK.</li>
    <li> This was for a friend who was having eye surgery.  She was very pleased with the product!  It was wonderful not having to constantly fill a bag with ice!!!</li>
    <li> Buy this if you want to cool down your puffy eyes without the freezerburn. I love it! There is some room to blink and the whole thing looks pretty designed - despite the offputting packaging.</li>
    <li> I bought this product mainly based on reading the reviews. But now I think most of these reviews must have been written by the sellers of this product.  I found the eye mask tight, and heavy on the eyes. In fact I would find my vision quite blurry after wearing this mask for more than an hour(due to the actual pressure on the eyes). If you are only going to use it for less than an hour it might work for you. But if you want a mask for a plane trip, sleeping, napping, it is not designed very well.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife as a gift and she absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;She was very happy that no light gets into it and she can open and close her eyes with it on her face because there are reliefs in the mask for eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I get headaches/migraines often enough that a cold rag gets annoying and I wanted something better. That said it doesn&#x27;t stay cool for long, it&#x27;s NEVER cold cold as in freezing....even though it&#x27;s ALWAYS in my freezer when not being used. Withing 10-15min this thing is warm to the touch, yes it does block out the light but if it&#x27;s not cold it doesn&#x27;t serve 1/2 it&#x27;s purpose. For me it was a total waste of money though and I will only use it if I need a quick eye rest from being on the computer for school or work.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye mask for sleeping. It has beads in it so you can put it in the freezer until your ready to use it and it makes for a great cure to eye puffiness and headache reliever. I use mine all the time.</li>
    <li> I bought for my husband and he loves this product.  He reports the eye mask is comfortable and soothing.  It is designed just perfect and doesn&#x27;t slide around or off.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, nice weight to it and definitely blocks out light.  I purchased it for a meditation class - do not wear it for sleeping purposes.</li>
    <li> I got this to help with my dark under-eye circles. Not sure if it&#x27;s helped at all, but it feels really nice out of the freezer after you&#x27;ve had a stressful day. It does warm up within 20-30 minutes probably, but, it still feels good, and you could always put it back in for a bit. Haven&#x27;t tried it warm, yet.</li>
    <li> It is like a bean bag over your face, it covers your eyes good,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels heavy, sometimes hard to sleep with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell asleep with it only like 4x.</li>
    <li> A must have for sleeping late on the weekends! Wish the strap was wider but it stays on securely anyway.</li>
    <li> i suffer from really bad migranes and this does wonders i also use because i hate waking up to bright lights it helps when my husbamd has to get ready for work at 5 am i can still sleep peacefully, even better cold.</li>
    <li> My Husband have bad migraines and this helps him a lot ...throw it in the freezer until the next migraine...Shipping was very fast and the price is really good</li>
    <li> This is such a great mask, it is comfortable the perfect temperature and pressure....I had eye surgery and used it and now I use it just to relax.</li>
    <li> I like the weight of the product and the feel and quality of the fabric.  I am a bit disappointed that the product does not hold the cold longer than it does.  It seems to me that I just get started feeling some relief and then the coolness is gone and this is after reversing the mask.  It would also be nice if it could also be heated.</li>
    <li> I own several types of mask some just to keep light out some also to use during migraine or sinus headaches.  This is one of the best, works great when I have a headache.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the elastic could be alittle better.  It stays on unless I&#x27;m tossing and turning.</li>
    <li> I am new to sleep masks, but I read up and think I have found the best one!  Last night was one of my best nights of sleep because of the mask.  I froze the beads and wore it cold on my head for a little while until I became tired.  Then I slept straight through the night with it over my eyes.  It was very comfortable and blocked out all of the light.  This is key because my boyfriend works off hours and many times needs to turn on the lights in the middle of the night.  I never tried a sleep mask before but I feel that this will work great for everyday use and for when I get headaches which unfortunately happens quite often.  If you are looking for something slimmer, this is not for you.  However, it did not bother me when I slept on my side.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It just lightly cools all the right places during a migraine (for me). It contours to your face and doesn&#x27;t add pressure. However it doesn&#x27;t stay cold very long. But worth it for the relief it does give.</li>
    <li> this little thing worked wonders for me.  very well built. very comfy for night sleep.  loved the fact that you can wash it or put it in the freezer, for those suffering from migranes.  overall a great idea...</li>
    <li> If you need this for pain relief from headaches all you have to do is throw it into the freezer and let it chill up for a while. It works perfectly in that regard. I got this for my girlfriend who uses this as a sleeping aid. She uses it every night and has been using these for many years now. What is really great about it is that this is a long lasting product that can be used and abused for quite a while before it needs to be replaced. We are talking months here... And when replacement time comes the price is just right as it is really affordable.</li>
    <li> I use my eye mask every night, it helps with pain. It blocks out light and it&#x27;s so comfy on the eyes. I can&#x27;t go to sleep without mask on, I will highly recommend this product to anyone. The seller shipped it out fast, arrived on time. A great shopping experience.</li>
    <li> I sleep sound as a baby with this thing.  And also, I found that the heavy pressure it puts on the top of your nose creates a bit of sinus relief.  Unfortunately I had to knock a star down because the elastic strap that holds it on your head wore out in 3 months.  I managed to tie it so it&#x27;s back to fitting again, but think I&#x27;ll be ordering another soon.  Great for people who understand that darkness is they key to a perfect nights rest.</li>
    <li> For some reason, the manufacturer sewed X&#x27;s in the center of the mask. Guess what? Needle holes permit light to shine through right in your eyes if you happen to open them....&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the elastic band leaves my head sore in the morning...If the mask actually stays on all night, which it rarely does.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering how to clean the mask, too...&lt;br /&gt;This was a big waste of money for me!</li>
    <li> This mask is wonderful. I have difficulties sleeping, mainly because I have children and the only time to myself is at night and I usually end up not wanting to put my kindle down. In turn these kind of habits have made my eyes physically ache some days. This mask feels great and is very comfortable, but more than that, is it forces me to put the kindle down and relax. And I usually fall right to sleep with it on, it&#x27;s that comfortable. I highly recommend it!-Especially to new moms or anyone who finds napping during the day hard to do, but necessary!</li>
    <li> I already bought this product months ago and left a review. I recently decided to buy it again, because I wanted to have a back up, just in case I lose the first mask.&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve already said in the first review, this is by far the best mask that I&#x27;ve had, and now I&#x27;m totally hooked to it if I want to have a good night sleep in a &amp;#34;non dark environment&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The strongest point is its flexibility, it adapts to your face and nose and doesn&#x27;t hurt you if you sleep on the side.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative point is the band that keeps it around your head, definitely little and a bit weak as a result considering the weight of the mask. It also stretches out in time, but this is really not a issue because it can be easily fixed.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, unbeatable!</li>
    <li> My wife likes it. She throws it in the freezer and wears it to sleep.  It would be nice if it could be hot or cold.</li>
    <li> I bought this eye mask for myself over a month ago to travel with, and since the day it has arrived at my door, I have not slept a single night without it. I love how soft it is, how it completely and totally blocks out light, and I love the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; inside that make it really soft and squishy. I cannot stand thin, flimsy eye masks, and this is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> love the mask, I have migraines a lot and this mask was soothing somehow. Also, I am a night shift nurse, and I put this one when I go to sleep and it is like heaven. Honestly, it has worked better than taking Tylenol or Ibuprofen.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any pain relief, but do like the pressure that it provides.  Does a pretty good job of blocking out light but it does not stay on throughout the night.  Fortunately, this isn&#x27;t much of a problem for me because I only need the light blocked while I am actually falling asleep.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the IMAK a few weeks ago, and that makes one of I don&#x27;t know how many masks I&#x27;ve used in the past 5 or 6 years! I suffer from chronic migraines, and the IMAK mask is an absolute lifesaver. There are 3 of these in my freezer right now!&lt;br /&gt;When my head is throbbing, I take out one of these trusty masks, lie down in a cool room, and try to sleep. I also use one to sleep with at night as it blocks out the light. The cooling effect typically last about 30 to 45 minutes, long enough to fall asleep, and if I wake up, there&#x27;s always another one waiting. I really love how long they last before they start to lose the coldness fast.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any doubts about purchasing one of these, please don&#x27;t! I would recommend the IMAK to anyone, whether you just need a sleep mask, or you have migraines, then you&#x27;ll definitely love it!</li>
    <li> I have migraines so it the weight of the mask is very helpful.  It is soothing but sometimes that strap irritates my head.  All in all, a great product!</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase. It is comfortable and keeps the light out too. When I have a general headache or when my eyes are bothering me, I put this on. It really helps because I use a computer monitor ALL day long, which makes my eyes hurt and occasionally, my head.</li>
    <li> Likes: good product that is lightly weighted and helps block out the light when I either need a nap or need to relax. good product for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the elastic strap isn&#x27;t that great, but if it ever needs replaced it will be a easy fix.</li>
    <li> OK if you lay on your back, but if you lay on your side, you have to move some of the stuffing around to take away high spots... but works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with bag&#x27;s under my eyes along with headaches if you place it in a baggie in the freezer it gets nice and cold without freezing your face, it fits perfect and blocks out all light this is perfect for plane rides as well I love it</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weighted! I can&#x27;t rave enough about the pressure it puts on your forehead/temples. I used to shove pillows over my face during a migraine to get the cool, heavy sensation this thing provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stays cold! Love the little gel beads. Pop it in the freezer near your ice cube tray and it&#x27;s absolute heaven on your face. Soothes and helps you relax (as much as is possible during an episode).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blocks out ALL, and I do mean ALL, light! It does even more than blackout curtains. I am so impressed. My S.O. turned all the lights on in the bedroom once when I had this thing on, and I didn&#x27;t even notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stays put! I have long, thick hair and I tend to flop around at night. It hasn&#x27;t moved once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to get used to for side-sleepers.  Because it&#x27;s so heavily padded, rolling on your side kind of elevates you above the pillow at the temples, and it takes some adjustment to get comfortable in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I think this may be the very best money I&#x27;ve spent on Amazon, and you absolutely can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask. The little beads make my sinus&#x27; feel better and it completely blocks the light when I have a migrain. I can put it in the freezer to make it cold and heat it in the microwave to warm it up. My husband gets a kick out of the fact it has X&#x27;s over the eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million different types of masks and this is one of the best masks for when I have a migraine.</li>
    <li> I really like this. I use it with headaches and sinus pressure. The down side is it warms up to quick.</li>
    <li> Light limiting. Doesn&#x27;t fit as closely as I&#x27;d like, but can be frozen and used on puffy face or for headache. A little bulky.</li>
    <li> Did not relieve pain and it did not feel very comfortable wearing.  I had better results with a gel eye mask.</li>
    <li> She wears this when she has head pressure from her migraines.  She bought another one to use when the one I bought her warms up.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is exceptional!  I constantly get migraines and wanted an ice pack that would stay on my head and this was the perfect purchase. T&lt;br /&gt;Its weight from the beads gives it some preasure which helps even more and with the sewn eye spots this mask is also very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will definitely be buying more to always have a cold one on hand.</li>
    <li> The Eye Pillow feels great and stay cool. I use it for naps or just after I wake up and I feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> As the label says - Eye Pillow.... ahhhhh.  Without doing anything it has a slightly cool feel and so comfortable.  Haven&#x27;t tried to chill it yet, but all and all I am very happy with it and feels great every night I put it on .....  ahhhhhh....</li>
    <li> The photo shown in the picture is not the product that gets delivered.&lt;br /&gt; Besides, its nothing of a pain reliever mask. It is a beany bag shaped like an avg. eye mask.</li>
    <li> This is the most comfortable eye mask I have ever worn! I suffer from insanely bad migraines, and this is saving my life right now! Dramatic, I know, but it is very true. This blocks out almost 100% of light. It is made of extremely comfortable fabric and little gel beads, so it fits like a glove. I just ordered another one to give to my mom because she gets migraines as well. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Says that this is the only thing that really helps her when she gets a migraine.  This is a second-hand review.</li>
    <li> this pillow is not warm and a little cool, especially when first used.  It is just what I needed, and delivery was as expected</li>
    <li> It is great for headaches ! Great to just help you relax from a horrible day !&lt;br /&gt;Fits comfortably and forms your face well !&lt;br /&gt;Blocks all light !&lt;br /&gt;I love mine  ! Bought 2 so I&#x27;ll never be without !!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mask to use after sinus surgery. The beads in it make it feel very comfortable on your face. It doesn&#x27;t stay cold for long enough, but that is the only problem I found with it. I still enjoyed using it as a comfortable mask even when it was not cold.</li>
    <li> I figured upon arrival I would get something  that was either too cold or so bad that it coudln&#x27;t be worn to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so wrong, the reviews on here are spot on, this thing is great.. for the price it&#x27;s amazing. Feels great on the eyes. Light is no longer a problem and fits the face perfectly, the strap does come loose but doesn&#x27;t change the way it holds the mask on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking to relieve puffiness, headaches, this mask is great to own! - Please don&#x27;t buy those fake gel masks you see sold... when you put those in the freezer.. it&#x27;s so cold you will irritate your skin, plus most are made of latex and this is latex free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone out!</li>
    <li> this produce is exactly what it is advertized as and does what it is suppose to. i would recommend it</li>
    <li> a little heavy and the material is like a fuzz magnet. If you have pets it will be covered with hair before long. If you roll to your side it slips. can be very nice if heated or cooled tho.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this eye mask. The little beads in it soothe my head when I have headaches. I like to stick it in the freezer for a little while first, which just bumps up the relief! It also blocks out pretty much 100% of light, so if you&#x27;re trying to sleep during the day, this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> covers pretty well. very comfortable. looks well made.perfect for taking a nap in the afternoon. will recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> This mask is terrific! My daughters kept stealing mine so I bought one for everyone!  I have tried masks before but they don&#x27;t stay on or are uncomfortable. This mask is very comfortable and soothing; it also stays on really well. It blocks out the light even for a daytime nap. I am going to buy a couple more as gifts.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom as she gets migraines frequently.  She loves this mask, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I RECENTLY HAD AN EYE OPERATION. I PURCHASED THIS AND OTHERS AS THEY LAST ABOUT 20 MINUTES AND I COULD ROTATE THEM THIS WORKED BETTER THAN EXPECTED</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of eye masks and cooling eye masks!  This one it the BEST of them all and we now have one for everyone!  It blocks the ambient light and has the best cooling effect that I have found.  It actually remains cool for more than a short period of time.  The beads are soothing on the face and eyes without being too cold or bulky!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had *severe* migraines for more than 25 years (and I&#x27;m not 40 yet). This is a great product in that it both blocks the noise and can be frozen/refrigerated. My only gripe is that it gets a little too cold in the freezer but thaws too fast coming from the refrigerator. I just put a washcloth underneath when first using it from the freezer to avoid the extra pain I get from too much chill. Overall, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I suffer from chronic migraines and have not found a lot of relief from most OTC medications. I had tried a couple of eye masks but have not found them to be as satisfying, relieving or very cold for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does the job very well. It doesn&#x27;t stay cold for as long as I would like but I do get a good 30 to 40 minutes of solid relief, which, when paired with some OTC medications, usually does the trick. I keep this in a plastic bag in my freezer at all times so it is always ready. Just make sure that you don&#x27;t keep it in the door, as I have found it doesn&#x27;t get &#x27;as&#x27; cold then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased two of these after the first was left in a hotel, but would recommend it to anyone who gets migraine headaches, especially around or behind the eyes.</li>
    <li> I suffer from horrible sinus headaches, especially in the mornings. I have three cats, and am fairly allergic...but they are my babies and I wouldn&#x27;t get rid of them for the world. That being said, I run three air purifiers on turbo each night and I would still wake up with pounding headaches. I have tried all the drug store masks, but this one is absolutely unlike anything else I have ever had. I literally sleep with this on every night. When I need a little extra help calming down, I spray some lavender mist on it. The mist is super easy to make at home, and really adds a nice extra comfort when needed. I always chill it during the day and I am good to go till the morning. I honestly don&#x27;t know how I survived without this.</li>
    <li> This is the best sleep mastI have found it really does help with eye strain.  I plan on getting another one,so I will have a spare.</li>
    <li> Wonder for my headaches! It is cold once you pop it in the freezer for 30 minutes or so yet not too cold. It helps sooth a migraine. It stays on all night and I move around a lot. I also love that it blocks out all light.. Great product. So good I got one for my roomie.</li>
    <li> I love the IMAK Eye Pillow! I am a US Army vet who has found it difficult to sleep without wearing both ear plugs and a face mask for many years. When I discovered the IMAK, I was in heaven. I had tried many other brands and types (my mother-in-law even tried to make me some), but I always found that they leaked light, even in low light conditions. The IMAK is made with microbeads contained in a cotton-spandex material which molds itself to the contours of your face, even around the bridge of the nose. It is held in place by a fairly sturdy material covered elastic band. I am a very light sleeper who tosses and turns alot at night, and this product moves with me during intense dreaming and my tossing and turning. The only drawback I have with the product is the elastic band. I have owned 5 of them over the last 12 years (I just ordered another one today on Amazon). I wish the elastic headband was thicker in width, and held up longer. It is quite thin (about 3/8 inch), and stretches out with nightly use, in about 3-4 months. I have remedied this problem by just tying a knot in the back of the strap, making it fit snug against my head. I still rate this product a &amp;#34;five star&amp;#34;, as this is the only eye mask which has helped me sleep through the night without waking. On a side note (I have used it a few times for this), it can also be used to alleviate headaches and help you sleep better during the Summertime if you put it in the freezer before using it. The beads and covering material prevent the mask from getting too cold or irritating the skin of your face. It is easily hand washable with hot water or a very mild detergent, just remember to air dry it well (in a sunny area or in front of the woodstove).</li>
    <li> Very comfortable!! Love to wear it after keeping it in the freezer!! Very helpful for migraine sufferers!! I would like to order a second one to always have one cold and ready to go.</li>
    <li> Fits well but slides off during the night while sleeping in bed.  Love the cool beads inside, they conform well to the contours of the face.  It&#x27;s a little heavy to wear sitting up, as on an airplane, and slides down the face a little.  Otherwise I like it very well and use it every day!</li>
    <li> i suffer from migraines..and this is the best thing yet! its a total black out...no light gets through. you can freeze it for cold comfort or use it room temp when you are trying to nap during the day. I use mine every night! I will be purchasing another to keep in the fridge. A plus is the stitching ove  the eyes it lets you open your eyes under  the mask.</li>
    <li> the best eye mask I have found... shuts down morning light very well.  I highly recommend this product, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This mask molds easily around your eyes to totally block out any light. It is cool when first placing on your face which feels great and helps reduce eye swelling.</li>
    <li> This mask is great.  I used it after surgery and it is soothing and convenient.  Stays cold for about 20 minutes.  I ordered two so I could change them out.  The strap is comfortable and helps it stay in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I suffer from migraines as well as eye strain type headaches due to strabismus.  Sometimes when my eyes really start hurting, having cold around them really helps.  However, even after keeping in the freezer for over 24 hours, it did not stay cold for as long as I would have liked.  Also, I was intrigued that it was touted to NOT put pressure on the eyes themselves.  Unfortunately, I did not find this to be true.  I am also glad that I was not using this to completely block out light as there was still light getting through around my nose.  That said, I&#x27;m somewhat happy with the product.  After keeping it in my freezer, the cold feels really good around my eyes when my head really starts throbbing.  As a bonus, it really helps when I have a headache associated with hot flashes--soothes the headache AND helps cool me off a bit.  For that alone, I&#x27;ll keep it.  I just won&#x27;t be buying this particular one again.</li>
    <li> It does not stay cold but is soft and comfortable to wear. I even tried wetting it some berfore freezing but it only stays cool for a few minutes/would not buy another</li>
    <li> I have frequent migraines and this eye mask helps a lot.  It only has a couple of flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it doesn&#x27;t have an easy way to tighten the elastic strap.  There are two pliable little ties that can be used to double back the strap, but because they are so pliable they come loose after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it would be nice if the mask could also be heated.  Heating is not listed as an attribute and I don&#x27;t want to experiment and accidently damage the micro-beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I recommend this for any one who needs a therapeutic eye mask.  The micro-beads help to ease the pain and feel good.  Could just use a couple of improvements.</li>
    <li> Mask is great. The elastic cord no way supportive of the mask.  Lying down is the only way to use it.</li>
    <li> When my wife gets a migraine, she&#x27;s out of action for quite a while.  This mask really does help her recover more quickly so she can get on with her day.</li>
    <li> This is a great produt. The beads that are inside are alwsys cool to the touch and itblocks outall light. I love it!</li>
    <li> it helps clearr the pain of my migraines.  An for sinus headaches it helps ease the swelling as well.  thanks</li>
    <li> Got it for my mom. Works good as far as i could tell. She uses it every morning when she wakes up. She likes to have it frozen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned masks from the sharper image, Brookstone, just about every specialty outlet you can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial reaction was a little underwhelming ... but that&#x27;s before I actually slept with it. The beads inside the&lt;br /&gt;mask will contour to your face as you lay down on the pillow (or whatever position you&#x27;re in) and actually provide&lt;br /&gt;a full bodied support for that entire region of your face ... without suffocating you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a few sleeps with the mask on before you make your final judgment on it.</li>
    <li> I have been a migraine sufferer for nearing 20 years.  Recently I had to stop taking my prescription meds. I have been searching and testing out every which way to combat the migraine pain, and this mask is definitely helping.  I am freezing the mask before use and am very pleased with the cool relief it provides.  Prior to purchasing the mask I was using gel ice packs on face, which was too shockingly cold and uncomfortable.  This mask has the right amount of coolness when frozen and comfortable feel.  I am actually able to sort of sleep with a headache when using the mask.  (Which was impossible without.)  I am very pleased with it and highly recommend it to any migraine sufferer as it may provide relief to you as it has to me.  And, as always, perfect packing/shipping/delivery with Amazon.</li>
    <li> It was comfortable and did cool my eyes for about 5 min. Yet after 5min. it was room temperature again. I am somewhat happy and somewhat disappointed. I am kinda neutral towards this eye mask.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because she is very sensitive to light -- particularly in the mornings when I&#x27;m trying to get ready and she is still sleeping. Not only does it do a great job of blocking out the light, the slight pressure created by the cool beads is extremely relaxing. She&#x27;s now in a much better mood in the mornings and she swears that it has helped her headaches go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two drawbacks I would mention are that 1) the band is a little flimsy. It hasn&#x27;t been a big deal so far, but I can see it becoming an issue in the future. 2) I wish it could stay cooler longer. I don&#x27;t really think there&#x27;s any realistic way around this. As has been previously mentioned, you can always flip it over when one side gets too warm. Think of it like flipping a pillow over and feeling the cool side.</li>
    <li> I stashed this in the freezer and put it on last night.  Ahhhhhh....it felt so good on my eyes!  My allergies have been knocking me down so much lately and plus a long day at work yesterday made me feel like I had been through the ringer.  Putting this on was like taking a quick vacay!  I can&#x27;t wait to use it again tonight!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the computer for hours sometimes writing. In between breaks, I put on my mask just to rest my eyes. It is God sent! It fits comfortably around my eyes, nose and head. In fifteen minutes, I would have gotten the break I needed, to start all over again! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife to provide some relief from her headaches.  She keeps it in the freezer and uses it when she is nursing a bad headache.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love this eye mask. I suffer from frequent migraines/headaches, the only thing that gives me relief is a cold pack and sleep. I ordered this product because it had such great reviews and I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it. In fact, I am going to order another one as a back up. The first time I wore this mask, it was the middle of the day and I felt a headache coming on so I grabbed my mask and decided to take a nap. It was the best nap ever!! I slept so heavy and peacefully. When I woke up my headache was gone. I love this thing. You don&#x27;t have to use it cold but I keep it in the freezer because I like it cold. I even use it sometimes when I don&#x27;t have a headache just because I sleep so well with it! The mask is a soft cloth, and inside there are a million small beads that add a little weight to the mask making it very comfortable. It blocks out light completely even in the middle of a sunny day. I highly reccommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is a great little eye pillow that is very comfortable, fits very well, does a great job of blocking out light to aid in sleeping, and seems to be of quality.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who suffers from chronic migraines. It was a huge hit. He puts the eye mask in the freezer and the coldness soothes him when he has a headache. He also uses it to sleep every night and likes the gentle pressure on his eyes that keeps them closed. He highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> I love this eye mask!! Put it in the freezer for a few minutes &amp; it&#x27;s ready to use. I use it for migraines &amp; sinus headaches (on my forehead &amp; eyes and also on the back of my neck). The beads inside the mask feel wonderful on your face!</li>
    <li> I am super sensitive to light and get awful migraines.  Using this eye mask helps tremenddoul.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mask along with two others to see how they would differ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three, this one was the most comfortable, with a soft, cloth exterior that molds very well to your face. The materials inside have a very gentle cooling effect and you can easily wear it continuously until the cooling has worn off. The other masks were either too clammy/damp or a bit harsh in the case of the one where the inner material actually froze solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that none of these masks lasts very long -- perhaps 20-30 minutes max -- so your only option is to have several of them, and to rotate them as needed.</li>
    <li> This came in the mail today.  As a coincidence, by the time I got home from work I had a world-class migraine.  I put this in the fridge for an hour then laid down for 2 hours.  Awesome!  The headache is almost gone and it felt wonderful!  Doesn&#x27;t push on the eyes and puts just enough pressure on the sinus areas around the eyes!  If you have migraines or sinus pain, this is for you!</li>
    <li> I gave this sleep mask 5 stars in my earlier review.  It was wonderful. Now in 2012, they changed the product, and this new one compresses the interior beads so densely, it doesn&#x27;t mold to your skull and eyes anymore.  It just sits there on your eyes, pressing down.  Very uncomfortable.  The older version had a relaxed comfortable fit. It had recessed air pillows over the eyes, so it didn&#x27;t press down on your eyeballs.  This denser, more compressed version is pretty bad.  I hope they go back to their original model.</li>
    <li> This may be one of the single best investments I have ever made.  I no longer have to take sinus medicine at night to make sure that I don&#x27;t have a morning headache.  The weight is perfect on my face.  it is like a gentle massage with the cool beads.  The light blockage allows me to sleep significantly better while allowing me to open my eyes.  At this price, I have given several as gifts and gotten good feedback.  Amazon made the purchase easy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use when migraines make light intolerable.  It fits snugly enough to block light very thoroughly and it is heavy enough to provide a little pressure.  (I sometimes use a very stretched out headband over the mask to anchor it a bit more and add a touch more weight.)  The fabric is quite soft and doesn&#x27;t make my face hot.  I also like that while the mask rests firmly on my face, the area over my eyelids is raised.  This one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> The mask feels great and it is extremely comfortable. Unfortunatley the elastic stretches out to the point of no return and before you know it the mask starts sliding all over the place :( too bad. I loved this mask.</li>
    <li> It is the only one I found that works. The only problem is the band streches out. Need adjustable band.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often use the cold press function of this mask, but I love it to use as a regular sleep mask every night. The band is nice and snug so it won&#x27;t fall off my head during the night (I used to have issues with my old sleep mask.) It molds right to the face in a way that completely blocks out the light while still being super comfortable, and there are recesses over the eye part so you aren&#x27;t crushing your eyelashes or anything. Great sleep mask.</li>
    <li> I like it - I just wish it were a bit longer in size and not as stiff. Would be nice if it formed to face in case I didn&#x27;t want to wear the strap.  I keep wanting to try to stretch it out.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cure my migraine, but much better than an ice pack. Love the indentations for the eyes. And how it feels on my face. However, as others have said, warms up too quickly even right out of the freezer. But best thing I&#x27;ve found. So before the meds kick in, using this does take the edge off for a bit.</li>
    <li> I sleep with it every night. I wish I didn&#x27;t move so much bc it slips out of my head</li>
    <li> The item was exactly as described and more than fulfilled my expectations. I would suggest to anyone to buy this, and I would tell them it can be found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This mask is well constructed, decently priced, and, most of all, very helpful when I get a headache, which I get often. Couldn&#x27;t live without this</li>
    <li> I thought this mask was just a regular night mask you sleep with not one that weighed a pound.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this rating because I ezpected just a regular night mask you sleep woth not something that made your head hurt.</li>
    <li> As promised work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again, price is great also.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it for more than 3 months and steel believe it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I had bad headaches when pregnant and I loved this.  It stayed cool for a decent period of time.  It&#x27;s soft and cotton!!  Love cotton fabric!</li>
    <li> I bought this mask to keep out light since I work at night and sleep during the day. I like how it&#x27;s added bonus is that once frozen, it stays cold and is supposed to soothe migraines; however, once removed from a freezer and placed on your face, it only stays cold for about an hour, if that. Other than that fact, I like the mask and it works well for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> We have allergies in our family and are constantly&lt;br /&gt;covering eyes with a cool wash rag.  This little&lt;br /&gt;wonder mask has replaced our wash cloths&lt;br /&gt;We LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Soft and cool.  The elastic hugs it to the pain.  I put this on and fell asleep.  Woke up without sinus pain.</li>
    <li> Blocks out the light.  Beads help with headache and tension relief.  Stays cool without refrigeration.  It does get a little heavy, especially if sleeping on your side.  Wife getting better than two hours extra sleep a day.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. It really blocks out light and helps me sleep. I want to get another so I have always have one in the freezer to switch out. The only thing that I would change was the thickness of the strap. It&#x27;s a little thin and the mask tends to slip around while you sleep. If you&#x27;re just going to wear it when you have a headache or puffy eyes then you&#x27;re set.</li>
    <li> I have some of the most horrible headaches, and this product takes care of them very quickly. Anyone who has chronic headaches would benefit from this product.</li>
    <li> I need relief and a cold compress always helps. Now I can have the benefit of the cold without the wet.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 5 yrs (I have bought several). I have chronic headaches from a head injury. Not only can you use it cold but it works just as well keeping ALL light out and therefore helping me at times to sleep better and longer. I recommend this to everyone I know for either pain relief or to get better sleep in the middle of the day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE AMAZON.COM, I USE IT CONSTANTLY WHICH MEANS I SAVE GAS AND TIME.  FAST DELIVERY - EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. MY SLEEP MASK IS  WELL MADE AND IT IS COMFORTABLE.  WILL BUY FROM AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU MUCH!</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye mask to help me with migraine headaches and it works really well.  I put it in the freezer and when I used it, it stayed cold for quite a long time.  I like the weight of the mask too, it seems to help with the pain.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this eye mask about one month ago, and I have used it about three to four times a week. I love it, and it really helps with headaches. It&#x27;s also nice that it has places sown in so that you can comfortabley open your eyes while wearing the mask. I think that it would&#x27;ve been nice to have a removable cover for cleaning, and that you can&#x27;t heat it up, but other than that there really isn&#x27;t much else to complain about. My parents would use it too whenever they came to visit, so I bought two more for them, too! I would absolutely recommend this product to others, and will probably buy myself another in case anything would ever happen to this one.</li>
    <li> i love using this, i am using this when my eyes getting sour, it really release the sour, also, sometimes, i am using this when i am sleep,</li>
    <li> I am pregnant and get headaches regularly. Since I can&#x27;t take any medication I have been looking of other pain relief options. THIS MASK is GREAT! I popped it into the freezer, fell asleep at night with it on. WONDERFUL. It&#x27;s filled with sand of some sort and is really comfortable, and works wonders when cold. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Being the metrosexual modern man I am I followed my girlfriends lead and bought one of these after testing hers. It&#x27;s super relaxing and totally awesome. I wish it had an image of googley eyes on it. That would make it better. I knocked off a star for no googley eyes.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is so comfortable and keeps the light out. The eye dimples make it possible to open your eyes and blink with the mask on and the elastic strap is strechy and soft. I would buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> I get pretty intense migraines about once a week. I used to just put ice in a ziploc bag and put it over my eyes to help, but it wasn&#x27;t very comfortable and kept sliding off - rendering it useless. I got this as a last resort, thinking it couldn&#x27;t be worse than those other gel masks that smell bad and don&#x27;t work well. This was awesome! I absolutely love it! It isn&#x27;t a magic cure for severe migraines but it does help take the edge off pain until your medication kicks in. The directions recommend you place this in a bag before putting it in the freezer, and I second that. Because it is cloth, I think it would absorb whatever smells you got going on in the freezer. I also really like the X&#x27;s it has over the eyes because it gives you eyeball movement space.</li>
    <li> I have owned this for a couple years. This probably would work best as an eye mask when you&#x27;re lying on your back, but I haven&#x27;t used it for that. I bought it as a sleep mask. It blocks out light but it doesn&#x27;t stay on all night, and I find it uncomfortable when sleeping on my side. I have to scrunch up to the edge of the pillow so that the edge of the mask is off the pillow; when I just lie on the pillow, there is so much bulk that it presses against my head and is uncomfortable. I am so sick of it that I am back on here shopping for a thinner mask.</li>
    <li> Love this one.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and gets the job done.  It would have gotten 5 stars if it stayed cold longer.</li>
    <li> The elastic band holding it on is too short, rendering it way too tight for my head.  A silly place to skimp.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it. The only thing that could be better is if the rubber band was Velcro so that it wouldn&#x27;t press into your head at night. That becomes a little uncomfortable if you are the type of person, Like me, that gets a sore head from headbands. Other than that, it takes some getting used to  but it has done wonders for my dark circles and bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is so nice! What makes it so nice are the beads inside, the softness of the cover and the fact that it softly, molds to your face. It&#x27;s cold, but not uncomfortably so. You never feel like you have to take it off because your skin is going to get frostbitten. It&#x27;s a refreshing product that just feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the reasons that make it so nice also contribute to it not staying really cold for a long time. I do wish it stayed cold longer, but the other aspects that I have described are what makes me love it. So, I am fine with this product as it is. Just know, if you really need or want something that will remain cold for a long period of time (1 hour or more) this is not the eye mask for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I go to sleep super late and sometimes I wake up super early.  I was losing sleep and ladies don&#x27;t look well under those circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;I also have sinus issues.&lt;br /&gt;My God!  Slept like a baby.  I don&#x27;t even know it is morning until I take my mask off.  Every time I wake up and remove it I am SHOCKED to see how bright my room is.  With this mask on, you have NO clue.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS THING!  Just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Even when you cool it in freezer, it doesn&#x27;t ice you out.&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome.  No eyelash interference.&lt;br /&gt;YEAH!!</li>
    <li> Pretty great sleep mask. I used it a few times before gifting it to my light sleeper roommate. It&#x27;s nice. Can&#x27;t really say it being frozen helps though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The frozen is a gentle cool feeling and helps with headaches. This also blocks light really well. I used this when I was sick and trying to sleep during the day and it helped remarkably. After 2 years, it&#x27;s still in great shape! It doesn&#x27;t stay on your face very well while you sleep if you move, but it helps me go to sleep very well.</li>
    <li> The reviews oversold this item for me. It&#x27;s got some good points but ultimately did not work for what I needed. It&#x27;s collecting dust in my bedroom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not perfect since it&#x27;s not even really made to be a night mask, but it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far. It&#x27;s a bit bulky (since it&#x27;s basically a bean bag on your face) but it&#x27;s comfortable, good quality, stays in place, doesn&#x27;t put pressure on eye lids, and blocks out almost all light (see my edit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second best night mask that I&#x27;ve used: http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Essentials-Dreams-Contoured-Earplugs/dp/B000CCI4YU -  The issues I have with it are that it lets in light at the nose bridge, it doesn&#x27;t stay in place through the night, and it&#x27;s not the greatest quality (the strap and mask degrade fairly quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this bucky mask: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0098QMC1M/ - but it&#x27;s much too hard/stiff. The strap is painful on my ears and the mask moves around so the nose bridge cushion puts pressure on my eyelids at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve owned 2 IMAK masks and the first one seemed to be slightly larger and blocked out more light (basically 100%). So there might be some variance with these. That doesn&#x27;t change my opinion that this is the best night mask I&#x27;ve used though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elastic strap also degrades fairly fast.</li>
    <li> Most eye masks are either too tight against your eyes, or they let light in around the bridge of your nose. Not this one! The beads conform to the contours of your face, effectively blocking out all light. It has the added bonus that you can toss it in the freezer if you need to cool your eyes. Particularly useful for those of us who suffer from eye irritation due to allergies. I absolutely love this thing!</li>
    <li> bought this a long time ago at CVS &amp; fell in love. so refreshing at night, lasted years. Word to the wise - it is pretty porous &amp; can absorb any smells in your freezer/frig, so keep it in a ziplock bag/container. I had to learn the hard way when I lived w/ a messy roommate who had something nasty rotting in her freezer... I washed that mask 20x, sprayed it with febreeze, EVERYTHING &amp; couldn&#x27;t get the smell out... so now that I have a new one, it is safely nestled in a ziplock bag :)</li>
    <li> I wish it would stay cool longer. For me, it&#x27;s only cool for about 10-15 mins after I apply it onto my eyes. On a positive note, it has reduced the puffiness of my eye bags.</li>
    <li> This eye mask id warm within  5 minutes! It does not stay cold. Paid more for postage then the product.</li>
    <li> Om gosh these work so well, like a dream, pun intended.  Not heavy on the face but thoroughly does the job.  I have migraines so these will be wonderful but they&#x27;d be wonderful for blocking out light anyway.</li>
    <li> These are very comfortable. They are a bit heavy with the beads, but I like that they don&#x27;t crush your eyes like most masks. You can actually open up your eyes underneath the mask and there&#x27;s room to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very nice product. I wish they had a more fragrant version for aromatherapy purposes as well!</li>
    <li> This is a convenient product. I find it easy to wear it to bed and go to sleep with it on. It is not messy and quite easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> I get way too many migraines for one person to suffer through and this is great. While I cannot use it as a sleep mask because I am a side sleeper and the weight of the mask keeps it from staying on properly, it is great when I am laying down or reclining in my chair to block out light and offer cooling relief. For sleeping, I ordered a different mask (Macks Dreamweaver Contoured Sleep Mask).</li>
    <li> The filler (feels like a very fine sand) lets it sink nicely onto your face.  Even more comfortable then a standard eye mask.  It only has a single strap and I feel a second would allow me to hold it on more securely so I may add an additional one myself.  I actually wear this to sleep in and want it to stay secure no matter which way I place my head.  Really a great product and whether I have a headache or not it just feels good to have that slight pressure on your sinuses.</li>
    <li> I like this mask, sure keeps the dark out.  However, the mask is really thick, and seems to have a bunch of tiny balls inside it, so it is a little heavy for my taste.  The strap is really thin, but it has not broken yet. It is a little uncomfortable around the top of my ears, in the night, I can feel it rubbing wrong on my ears and I have to adjust.  I would have preferred the strap to be a little more thicker for comfort reasons, and it seems to me if it would be a little thicker, it would support the mask better since the mask is slightly heavy. Overall a decent mask for the price.</li>
    <li> This may be nice for some people. It is full of beans (noisy), sticks out, and is pretty heavy. Just not for me, but has some comfort and there is room for ones eyes and lashes others might appreciate it but it is not really for sleep or travel. This seems like it might be for a short rest on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend it, would not buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> This is the first mask I&#x27;ve still had on my face when I woke up.  All other masks come off at some point during the night.  It&#x27;s very comfortable, although it did take about 10 minutes to feel normal on my face. Very pleased with this mask.</li>
    <li> I use this to sleep, and while I love how it gets nice and cold but not &amp;#34;freeze your eyeballs out&amp;#34; cold, by the time i wake up i have to tear the thing off because all the layers of beads and fabric make the thing get really warm by the next morning. I had hoped it would at least breathe well enough that that wouldn&#x27;t happen... but every morning i wake up with a hot face.</li>
    <li> IMAK Eye Pillow sure meets my needs for night relief for my old tired eyes. Also helps keep under eye puffiness to minimum! Have gone through many eye masks, nothing comes even close to the comfort of the &#x27;Eye Pillow&#x27; for me!</li>
    <li> Bought for when I get migraines. Keep it in the freezer and pull out when I have one. Real reliever. Also nice if eyes are puffy</li>
    <li> I cant go to sleep without my mask. Wonderful product.  Knocks me right out. Blocks all light and the beads adds a nice feel to the eye area. Great for when you need to  block light when experiencing a migraine or you are just trying to get a relaxing sleep.</li>
    <li> Great for placing in the freezer and using for the relief of migraines and other types of headaches. I think that it is too heavy to have on your eyes and sleep with at night but a quick night in the afternoon it works or sleeping on the plane maybe.</li>
    <li> I have tried several eye masks and this one is the best, it is soft but not slippery and has just the right amount of pressure on my face, it does not mash your eyes. Using it from the freezer is great, its not ice cold and hard like the masks filled with liquid,but cool and soft to sooth my puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mask for two reasons: first, to shield my eyes from ambient light coming from the outside of my window; and second, to help me with my sinus issues during winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great at shielding light, and it is very comfortable to wear as it is filled with tiny beads that conform nicely to your face. There are also little dimples that allow your eye lids to feel comfortable. The only issue I have with this mask is that it tends to fall off while I sleep because it is a bit heavier than your standard sleeping mask. This does not happen every night just sometimes. It is not a big deal because it occurs whilst I am asleep, and the point is to fall asleep isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also cool this mask in the freezer, which is really nice if you have a sinus cold or a head ache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone as it is better than average.</li>
    <li> This mask must weigh three pounds. I suffer from migraines fairly well controlled by medication prescribed by my neurologist. However this mask actually made the headaches worse. The mask is packed so heavily with beads of some sort that the weight made my eyes ache as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye mask for sleeping that I have ever used. I got one from a family member about 5 years ago. When my old one broke 3 years later, I ordered this one. I love it. It blocks bright lights, fits really comfortable and relieved pressure on my sinuses when I had a cold. This is the only mask I want to use!</li>
    <li> I love this eye mask. I use it all the time. I am a lite sleeper and any light will wake me up. But with the eye mask I did not have to worry about that. It is also perfect because I place it in the freezer which helps on the days that I have a migraine. I also take the eye mask on my travels.</li>
    <li> It feels heavy on the eyes which I like.  It&#x27;s nice to have the option to heat it up or have it cold.  The elastic band could be a little tighter, or it&#x27;d be nice if it was adjustable, but since you are just lying down with it on theres not much reason it should come off.</li>
    <li> I use this frequently for migraines. It is comfortable, not too tight but doesn&#x27;t slide off, and keeps light out. I keep mine in the freezer and it stays cool for a good amount of time. I&#x27;ve had it for a year and it has held up well. I even bought another one for my mother who also suffers from migraines.</li>
    <li> I suffer from migraine headaches and when I get one I pull this eye mask out of my freezer and it really helps soothe my headaches and eye pain. The beads inside stay cool for a long time and the outside cover is very soft and comfortable. I suggest this product for anyone with migraines or sinus problems.</li>
    <li> I got this mask for my migraines. When they&#x27;re really bad it feels good to have this on after freezing it. It doesn&#x27;t freeze your eyeballs either. The problem is that after 15-20 minutes it&#x27;s already warmed up and is nothing more than a gentle weight on my face. I&#x27;m thinking about buying another one so I can always have one in the freezer. Then again, I would have to keep getting out of bed to change the mask and it might not get cold enough with only 15 minutes in the freezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for the price of $10 to cool off a migraine for a few minutes, but for sleeping I still LOVE my $20 light blocking mask from Dream Essentials. [[ASIN:B000PICAKA Dream Essentials Escape Luxury Travel and Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch, Blueberry]]</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I was so impressed by this product that I had to. I suffer from migraines and I&#x27;m currently pregnant so taking medication is not an option. A friend told me about this mask and I ordered it immediately. I hadn&#x27;t slept in days and the second I put that mask on it soothed my migraine and let me sleep peacefully. I love that you can put it in the freezer. Great product!</li>
    <li> As a sufferer of migraines I saw this and had to have it.  I like it, it shuts out all light.  The downfall?  It stays cold for maybe 5 minutes...</li>
    <li> The only thing I can say negative about this mask is that the head strap is too loose.  I have a very small head which causes the mask to fall down.  But I love the beads in the mask and the way it blocks out all the light.</li>
    <li> How disappointing to receive a replacement of e only sleeping mask that huge ever liked and receive this cheaply made and smaller version, in the same box. I guess that is what happens when things are made in china. The old one was silky and very soft and comfortable on your face. This one feels more like t-shirt material w a high polyester content. It&#x27;s more narrow, shaped completely different in fact. Sad. The one thing I approve of is the adjustable band. Besides that, nada. Bring back the old imak!! Send everyone who has got this new, and far from improved one, a free replacement. It&#x27;s the least you can do.</li>
    <li> I use this when my eyes are worn out and tired.  It&#x27;s helpful.  The straps fit comfortably over my head, and no light leaks through.  The only complaint I have is the eye stitches make my eyes itch.  I can&#x27;t wear it too long before I have to start rubbing my eyes.</li>
    <li> My wife got two of these to rotate through the freezer for her migranes and they work great!  Would recomend to anyone who gets them!</li>
    <li> Worth the slightly extra money when compared to the cheapy eye masks you find at any local stores. The filling is nice. Place in a ziplock and toss in the freezer between uses.</li>
    <li> The eye mask is a perfect item for people who suffer with headaches.  The mask is made of quality fabric along with the band.</li>
    <li> working third I found it hard to go to sleep with the light coming through the windows but these have saved me</li>
    <li> when the sun starts coming up at 4 am I am NOT a happy person. This blocks out more light that any other of the hundreds I have used and you can freeze it for relief of tired eyes. It was like a 2 for 1  and I would recomend to anyone</li>
    <li> I have been using this IMAK sleep mask for about two months. This is perhaps the most comfortable sleep mask I have used and I own several. It totally blocks out the light, the strap and eye slots are a perfect fit for me.  I love that I can either put it in the fridge or freezer to use cold when I&#x27;m having sinus issues or a headache, AND it really relieves the problem. I also use it at room temp for normal nights. In a word....it&#x27;s GREAT.</li>
    <li> I have horrible eye pain from retinopathy and this not only stops the eye pain but stops the headache that comes with it.  It is so comfortable, so soothing, and completely shuts out light.  Its a good buy.</li>
    <li> I suffered with migraine headaches quite a bit.  Decided to try the eye pain relief mask on the first day after using it, my head pain is gone.  It actually feel like my eyes are getting massage.  Totally awesome!</li>
    <li> My wife suffers from migraines and so many things can bring them on.  This product shuts out the visual world completely and has made her life so livable.</li>
    <li> The mask itself is pretty good, though heavier/thicker than I expected.  However, the strap is too big and the flimsy adjustor on it broke the first night so now the mask never stays on.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for my tired eyes and headaches. Provides such soothing relief and darkening of the room. Super product.!</li>
    <li> sleep great everynight its nice and cool on my eyes and when the old lady is watching tv i can still go to sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an eye mask for a few years until it was falling apart..They are not easy to find in local stores, so when I saw it on Amazon, I purchased it and it was better than the one I had.  It is comfortable, relieves eye and head pain, as well as blocking out light.  I had no problems with my order, shipping was on time, and I had no need to contact anyone with any issues.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs rest without taking any medication.</li>
    <li> I cannot maintain sleep if there is any light in the room. This is why I used to wake up at dawn no matter how tired I was. I tried several eye masks that were useless. This is the only one that I loved. I am able to maintain a 7-8 hours uninterrupted sleep. I have a much better quality of life as a result of the good night sleep.&lt;br /&gt;This mask is broad so it doesnt leave space for any light to sneak in. It is stuffed with soft material that exerts some pressure on the face. It helps sealing the light out. It can be annoying in the beginning to feel this light pressure but give it a week and you will not notice it anymore. It has two stitches where the eyeballs go so your eyes have some space around them. It does not crush your lashes. It also fits around the nose ridge.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much that I sent it to my sister as a gift. At first she complained from the pressure on her face. But when I checked again a while later she told me she loves it and uses it every night. The mask molds to the shape of the face so it doesn&#x27;t press on the face anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it since july and the bands that go around the head to hold the mask are still in good shape. They didnt loosen up. At the same time they are comfortable and they dnt pressure or hurt the head. The mask is still on my face when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is the best mask out there for sealing light out.</li>
    <li> cool, a bit heavy, and after several uses a funny little scratchy feeling across the lids.</li>
    <li> I suffer from frequent migraines and this eye mask really helps when the pain is bad behind my eyes. It blocks out the light and the cold which helps the pain.</li>
    <li> she uses this with her migrains and totally loves this she said it is awesome for heat and cold and thinks maybethere should be more tems like this for pain in other palces of the body,</li>
    <li> It does block out the light, but don&#x27;t expect to use it for sleeping unless you sleep on your back. It won&#x27;t stay on your face because it slides off since it is too heavy.</li>
    <li> If you want the light from making you not sleep well, then this it. It is a bit heavy but doesn&#x27;t sit right on top of your eyes, it leaves enough room so you could even blink. I have issues with a light room in the morning so I slip this on and go back to sleep for a few hours more then wake up to feel more rested and all around nicer to the people around me! It also feels cool on your face at first and lasts for about a half hour which if you get headaches (which I do but haven&#x27;t had one since this mask purchase yet) would feel good.</li>
    <li> sweet dreams.  happy napping.  not crushing the eyes so no blurry vision when you wake up and take the mask off.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent eye mask. I am usually awake as soon as any light comes through the window in the morning and this mask really does block out the light. I also find the weight of the mask very soothing to my eyes and face. I have been using it for several months and I find that when I go to bed I now crave the sensation of that weight on my eye sockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve had with it is that the strap that holds it on my head is somewhat loose. I have made knots in it to tighten the strap and that helps, but there are still mornings that I wake up and the mask has fallen off during the night. I can imagine that a two-strap design would hold the mask in place better. Despite this flaw, I like the actual mask so much, I don&#x27;t want to go looking for something different.</li>
    <li> I love this, I use this to help me relax at night and I sleep so soundly and wake up refreshed every time I fall asleep wearing this. The only problem is, the coolness doesn&#x27;t last too long. Maybe about 10-15 minutes, but thats perfect since I&#x27;m usually asleep by then!</li>
    <li> I think this works really well for a refreshing few minutes of eye relief.  It is solid and gets cold enough to last for a half hour (best if you flip it halfway), and still light enough not to bother you if you doze off for a lot longer.  I got a second one for the times I forget to put it back in the freezer.</li>
    <li> i deal with migraines on a regular basis - this mask does amazing things for me when i&#x27;m suffering.  it&#x27;s so comfortable; i just wish it would stay colder a little longer.</li>
    <li> Feels good if you have chronic sinus issues but doesn&#x27;t clock out all the light. Maybe I just have a big nose?</li>
    <li> This mask is great I just love it and takes the pain away from headaches and takes away puffiness under the eye&#x27;s. it&#x27;s very relaxing!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. We have both used it. It is kind of heavy, cool when you put it on. very comfortable!</li>
    <li> This product is very comfortable for the first 4 hours of sleep. However, it fits my big head a little tight and the strap is not adjustable. This wouldn&#x27;t really be a problem except that the construction of this mask causes it to put pressure on my sinuses while I&#x27;m sleeping, which results in a headache in the morning--and by morning I mean about 4 AM. I only knocked it down one star for this because (1) I do have a bigger head, (2) I have not yet tried adjusting the temperature of the mask, and (3) it&#x27;s still suiting its purpose for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really bought this for was travel. So on a flight or while driving cross-country, the limited time this is comfortable for me is not really a factor. Also, because it is so tight, it blocks out light amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has tried one of those typical silk or satin masks and needs something a little more heavy duty.</li>
    <li> The part that covers your eyes are perfect. The part that wraps around your head is horrible and cheap. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> I have migraines all the time. Wearing this mask at night has prevented me from waking with migraines.  The best mask.</li>
    <li> Ok.  Does provide a cool feel but a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> The bead like material inside this face mask allow it to easily contour to your face making it very comfortable. I use it mainly to block out light if my wife wakes up in the middle of the night and turns on a light or the TV. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 as the first one I had, the elastic band started losing it&#x27;s elasticity and there is no adjustment. Although, no adjustment means no buckle like connection so it&#x27;s more comfortable. I had also had the one for 3 years so I guess that&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have migraines but needed something to keep out the daylight after overnight shifts and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it (even though I work days now).  there is something soothing about it and it just feels good.  I would just like an adjustable strap.  it&#x27;s too loose for my head and thus falls out of proper positioning.  I tied a knot in the elastic strap band but if you lay on it, that is uncomfortable. if they find a good way to adjust the strap I would give it a 5 star.  regardless of the strap issue, it&#x27;s still worth having.  it&#x27;s my second one.</li>
    <li> I got this because some reviewers said it blocks out all the light and I work at night.  It does do just that.  They are right though the strap is a little on the thin side, but it still keeps the mask on me without any issue there.  It is rare I have to adjust the mask.  It also actually works better at keeping the light out than another thick (considered very nice) sleep mask I had worn for some time. I&#x27;m glad that one finally wore out!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sleep mask! I originally bought one at the grocery, as they usually have it there, or at a CVS sometimes. My mom suffers from migraines and kept borrowing mine, so I just gave it to her, as I had a newborn and wasn&#x27;t using it much.  Well, now my daughter is almost 10 months now, and sleeping through the night so I wanted my eye mask back. Instead of taking it from my mom, who loves it - I bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s exactly the same as the one I had purchased 3 years ago on a whim. It goes in a zip lock bag in the freezer during the day, and I take it out at night to help keep me cool (I live in N. Texas!) and help keep my own migraines and severe headaches from popping up in the heat and humidity. The beads inside conform perfect to my face and block out all the light, and the stitching across the actual eye is perfect and doesn&#x27;t cause any beads to go where my actual eyes are at to keep unwanted pressure off them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously cannot give this sleep mask a better review, and suggest it to all my friends with headache issues, or wanting a sleep mask that helps with pain relief as well. You can sure spend $50 bucks on one that&#x27;s supposed to be great from Brookstone, or even Tempurpedic, but this mask is the ONLY sleep mask I can use and be comfortable. It stays on well all night, and conforms to my face just the way I need it to every night. Buy it - You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for a migraine sufferer.  She likes it a lot!  We haven&#x27;t experienced any problems so far (it&#x27;s been about 2 years now).</li>
    <li> Soft, cooling, comfortable, good eye and surrounding area coverage. Great product! I will recommend this to others.  It even makes a great mask just to wear to bed for darkness too.</li>
    <li> This mask is so popular in our household that I am online ordering more right now. My wife and 5yr old daughter both love it (one has allergies, the other a sinus cold at the moment). Between &amp;#34;freeze&amp;#34; times and both wanting to use it I need to pick up a couple *sigh*. I thought it would be too big for our daughter, but she will fall asleep with it.</li>
    <li> I loved this eye mask and it helps relieve my migraines when they occur around the eyes.  Usually my eyes just throb and ache and there is little I can do but freezing the eye mask and then wearing it provides much needed relief.  I would definitely recommend for migraine sufferers.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for anybody that works graveyards.  It is heavy and cool.......  Completely keeps light out.  It is a sleep saver.</li>
    <li> The product does help in soothing eye pain the only flaw that I have with this product is that is does not stay in place while you sleep if the side was wider like the Revolutionary Patent Sleep Mask it wold be a great eye mask.</li>
    <li> This is a very comfortable mask, but it only stays cold for 8-10 minutes. I need more than that to find relief. I bought this to try to cut down on how much Tylenol I have been taking for migraines during my pregnancy. I&#x27;m disappointed and it was a waste of money.</li>
