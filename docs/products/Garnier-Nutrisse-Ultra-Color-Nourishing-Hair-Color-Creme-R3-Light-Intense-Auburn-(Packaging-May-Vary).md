<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I  wanted to dye my hair red but having dark brown, practically black hair, I was a little skeptical that the color would take to my hair. Having never dyed my hair before this color came out great and it was more then noticeable on my natural kinky AA hair. Especially in the sun. I dyed it in late February and it&#x27;s still in my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this because it says made for dark hair but it only tinted my dark brown hair a red color only visible in the daylight. It smells awesome but the product doesn&#x27;t work as advertised except maybe on virgin hair. I waited two weeks before trying again using vidal sassoons medium vibrant red 5rr. Now that product will deliver the results desired.</li>
    <li> Okay, first off if you are blonde, DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT FIRST. If you know a thing or two about hair you know it&#x27;s not smart at all to go straight from such a light color to a darker color. If you want this color, bought the box, and it isn&#x27;t what you wanted it&#x27;s because you aren&#x27;t suppose to dye it straight from blonde. You have to first dye it brunette first. And dying it one color then dying it right again after wont ruin your hair like you might think it will. Trust me this brand of hair is good I always have used it and I have dyed it one color and then again twice in a day, no damage was done to my hair and my hair is really thin. I honestly love this brand of hair dye, I think if you actually know what to do, you&#x27;ll have great results.</li>
    <li> I love Garnier, and when I was sick of my black hair yet again and wanted to go back to red yet again, I thought maybe I could skip the hair-bleaching step with this color and take a shortcut to red. It probably would&#x27;ve worked - except my black hair was colored black, not natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair color is a fierce fire-engine red, and delivers so much concentrated pigment to your hair that it won&#x27;t all wash out the day you color, no matter how long you rinse. It probably works well for those with naturally dark hair, and it&#x27;s about time - you shouldn&#x27;t have to actually bleach your hair to go from dark to red!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I did want to let people know not to make the same mistake I did - if you&#x27;ve colored your hair a dark color, and want to go red, you&#x27;re going to have to bleach or use Color Oops! or something to get the dark color out of your hair. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking; this seems very obvious now ... Maybe all this dye is starting to get to me!</li>
    <li> Got lots of compliments on this color.  Although red fades fast, this one actually seems to stop fading after the 10th wash or so (normally I can see the red dye washing down the drain even after the 20th wash!)  Was a little brighter than I&#x27;d expected, or than the photo indicates but prob because my hair is naturally blonde (altho was already dyed red when I used this product).  However, like I said, after a few fading washes it toned down a little.  Overall happy with it and actually seemed to make my hair healthier, softer, and loooove the deep conditioner included.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I dyed my hair red. I have black-brown hair. I didn&#x27;t think that the would show up but I had read so many good reviews about this certain product.&lt;br /&gt;The color looked GORGEOUS, it was very dark red at first. After the second and third wash it became lighter and I absolutely loved it. I loved the fact that it didn&#x27;t look brown and was more red.&lt;br /&gt;After the forth wash was still okay but the red wasn&#x27;t as vibrant as it was at first.&lt;br /&gt;Washed my hair today---&gt;&gt;&gt; fifth wash ---&gt;&gt;&gt; the red is gone!!! Now my hair is Chestnut-brown. More brown than red. The roots are a bit lighter than the rest, but it&#x27;s not that noticeable. I&#x27;m not sure if the color is gonna stay after a second dye.&lt;br /&gt;And it doesn&#x27;t work on dyed black hair. I dyed some parts of my hair black last year, they are still black! a small part of my hair was bleached 4, 5 months ago and that part has a tone of brown-orange, not very red.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the smell of this product. Very easy to use. Easy to follow instructions. Dried my hair a little bit.</li>
    <li> The exact color I want</li>
    <li> I have very dark brown hair, its actually borderline black. I thought about dying my hair just for a change for the coming summer and wasnt sure what to use. I had used a product a couple years back that i absolutely loved, it left my hair with a very nice purple red tint that looked wonderful when in the sunlight. I tried to match that again with Garnier (a product that i faithfully use as my shampoo and conditioner) when dying my hair, even though the creme was a pinkish red, i couldn&#x27;t tell how well it was covering my natural color so the end product wasnt so much an all over color and left my natural hair showing through. now dont get me wrong, it looks great and makes me feel very sexy and matched what i had used years ago perfectly!! i WILL be buying and using this product all summer. and what is great with my dark hair color it is subtle enough of a change that my proffesional work place doesn&#x27;t have a problem with it at all.  it looks great and makes me feel greater. deffinately a good buy when looking for a bit of change!!    --*-** EDIT **-*--    I&#x27;ve let my hair go a while withough redying and as with any color it shows a difference, but something i had not experianced before what that this coloring actually lightened up alot when not re-dyed. i now have a lighter red colored hair with dark brown roots, not nice!!!  the color is still good i guess, but not near as nice as it was before fading</li>
    <li> Tried this today on my naturally black hair - left it on for 25 mins as per product instructions. My hair looks pretty much the same (I&#x27;m assuming if I go stand out in the sun, i&#x27;ll see the red in it).     One good thing though - is that the bleached streaks in my hair now have a fabulous red/burgundy blow to it which I really like.    So if you have black hair, I&#x27;d recommend using this only if you already have some highlights.     Just a word of warning - this product looks super scary when you turn it on. It&#x27;s orange and takes at least 15mins to wash out. Watch you don&#x27;t stain your bathroom tiles &amp; towels etc.    Good luck!  (PS - theres a youtube review of this product where the girls hair looks amazing afterwards - its super super bright so check that out (google &#x27;R3 youtube garnier ultra color&#x27;).</li>
    <li> I tried this color on a whim and loved it then couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so I ordered it and I&#x27;m just as happy with the color this time around.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping to turn my naturally dark brown, nearly black hair, red. The first time, my hair was intensely red--only in direct sunlight. In any other lighting it was almost darker than my natural hair color. I kept it that way for a week, and when it began to fade, my roots and tips were red, but all the inbetween hair was still very dark brown. Tonight I decided to give it another try, this time using Color Oops to take out any hair dye that might have been interfering with the process. The Color Oops took all the red out of my hair and any remaining dye, and also lightened my hair to a medium brown. I tried the dye again. This time, my hair has turned into a dark mahogany color. Nothing like the box. There is one patch of roots that is very bright red but that&#x27;s it. I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> After having my hair dyed bright red in a salon several months ago and being irked by the costs and length of the process, I turned to at home hair color, which I had been doing before getting dyed at the salon. I had tried several red hair dyes by Loreal&#x27;s Feria, but they always faded much to quickly and weren&#x27;t as vibrant as they looked. Then I picked up this box, thinking, \\&quot;Hey, its cheaper, and its the same shade. Will probably give me the same results.\\&quot; I was wrong. It gave me better ones. I dyed my hair in the last hour and the best thing I can say so far is, my hair doesnt feel damaged at all! Granted that I mixed the conditioner with a masque, but my hair feels like silk. After loreal it always felt like straw and took a while to get back into shape. But geez, this stuff is great! It gave me a more red color (although still a bit darker than I&#x27;d like). Waiting to see if it will fade as quickly as the other dyes. I have really dry curls, so I dont shampoo everyday; usually even conditioner leeches color out of my hair; I have high hopes for this color.</li>
    <li> I love the color! It didn&#x27;t turn out as burgundy as it shows on the box. Now that may be because I got the formula for darker hair. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this dye. It wasn&#x27;t smelly, it wasn&#x27;t giving you a high, it looks luxurious!   However, (this may just be my hair type too!) my hair didn&#x27;t take to the dye as well as we&#x27;d hoped. I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s just because the natural oils you add into the dye were counter productive... I want to try again and maybe this time without adding the oils and see if I get better results.   Soo... maybe they should let the oils be outside the dye process?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from the UK and I ordered the colour &#x27;R3 Light Intense Auburn&#x27; as it isn&#x27;t available in england. Thanks to reviews on here, and youtube, I decided to go with it and order a couple of boxes. I&#x27;m very happy that I did as the colour is gorgeous. It&#x27;s not a &#x27;true&#x27; auburn, I would say it&#x27;s more red, as shown on the packaging. It&#x27;s quite difficult to wash out and get the water to run clear afterwards, but that&#x27;s often the way with red hair dyes. Having said that, my hair is silky soft and looks to be in great condition. This is a superb product and is one I will be using again.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this hair color. The Box says it&#x27;s for dark hair, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am African-American my hair is dark brown, almost black, I left the dye in for at least an hour, the box says 35mins....after an hour, I wash it out...it did not work, my hair is still it&#x27;s original color. with tiny strands of a brown red never again! if you want red hair get it done professionally.</li>
    <li> Garnier Nutrisse R3 Light Intense Auburn has got to be the best&lt;br /&gt;hair color I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have long hair that is past my&lt;br /&gt;shoulders and there was enough in the bottle for me to just&lt;br /&gt;use one bottle instead of two.  That&#x27;s a huge plus and it left&lt;br /&gt;my hair so shiny and smooth.  The color is vibrant and bright&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I love this hair color! I have really dark brown hair and it has always been difficult to get my hair to lift or lighten so when I found out this product was specifically for darker hair I was soo happy. The initial application of this hair color did not turn out as vibrant as I wanted it to so I waited for about 3 weeks and tried again and it took very well the second time.  I still don&#x27;t think I got the results as shown on the box but I am very happy nonetheless. For some reason it came out brownish burgundy and plum more than anything. I get compliments with this hair color all the time. Another thing, if it doesn&#x27;t lift as much as you want it. Wait a few days and go out in the sun a lot. Sun lightens hair a lot and brings forth even more color.</li>
    <li> the box itself says that it doesnt work on dyed black hair, so i stripped the dye with coloroops till it turned to a more orangeish colour&lt;br /&gt;i applied the dye for 15 minutes and waited another 30 minutes before washing it out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the colour came out a beautiful red auburn, if you buy this dye though hoping it will be like the red red you see on the box itself, youll prob be dissapointed and you should try a semi permenant unnatural dye like manic panic , splat, ion etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dyed my hair with this colour 3 weeks ago and it already is in need for a redying, it says its a permenant dye, but all dyes fade from hair , i have been swimming every single day , washing my hair 4 times a week, so this is actually pretty impressive colour lasting due to how much my hair endures washing and chemicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for men and woman with dry damanged hair i 100% suggest you be careful cause this dye does have ammonia which can cause damage , just a quick heads up in case you dont read the ingrediants, cause even tho it makes it look like a healthy shampoo with the \\&quot;nourishing\\&quot; colour and conditioner stuff , dont be fooled as an experiance with an old friend dying her hair with this 2 times... didnt work out well for her long hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so lets look over the pros and cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros&lt;br /&gt;when done right in comes out a beautiful red auburn&lt;br /&gt;it lasts a reasonable amount of time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;has ammonia&lt;br /&gt;doesnt come out exactly as it shows in the picture on the box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall i give it 4 stars do to the good experiance with using this dye</li>
    <li> I love this! Using it is easy, effortless, and it really covers. Not to mention the outcome of the color is exactly as advertised. I would definately recommend this to anyone wanting to go for a bright Dark Red.</li>
    <li> I thought to give this a try since it said that it was created for dark hair. I tried it only to have a few random spots red which made my hair look trashy and gross. If I hold my hair up to the light you can see the color but who is going to constantly stand under the light?! Waste of money. Going back to l&#x27;oreal.</li>
    <li> I like the color, and it came out great.  Just a note: if you have black hair, you have to leave it on longer than it says.  I left it on for about 50min because my roots are black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other Garnier hair color products, but they never bleeds like this one.  After coloring, It&#x27;s impossible to rinse it completely because the color never stops coming out.  The color continued to bleed after coloring for like one month - basically until I bleached the color to dye it with a different color.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this again.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, wonderful color,loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars just because it does NOT work on dark hair it did make my tips red because they were already bleached but not the rest! my hair is dark brown and let me tell you NOW if you want to dye your hair red and have dark hair I would recommend hi color in red or magenta it depends how bright you want your hair to be! I want my hair red but not bright bright so I purchased hi color magenta (: and I got 2 since my hair is long and thick and mixed it with 20 developer 4.8 ounces!!!  My hair came out beautiful, not too bright just perfect!</li>
    <li> My hair has been pretty much every color, I&#x27;m naturally a medium brown though. I&#x27;ve had red hair a couple times before and knew it looked nice on me so I thought why not since it was an eternal losing battle trying to get ashy tones into my hair.   I had finally decided to embrace the red undertones in my hair by just going full out red again, and went out and purchased L&#x27;Oreal Feria Ruby Fusion (66) since I&#x27;ve liked L&#x27;oreal Feria before and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. My hair prior to dying it with Ruby Fusion, it was a dark blonde color. The new color turned out fairly decent, it wasn&#x27;t as red as I hoped but I thought it looked ok..and then 3 days later when I washed it for the very first time since dying it. It instantly turned my hair into just a flat reddish brown. Worst red hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used. I only use sulfate free shampoos etc, and my hair isn&#x27;t super damaged so there was no real reason for it to wash out THAT fast. I know red fades a lot faster than the other colors but seriously, one wash?  Disappointed.  Set in my desire to have red hair now that I had decided to do it and all, as well as being stuck with this icky brown-red color after just one wash, I went on the hunt for another red hair dye. That&#x27;s when I came across this one. I&#x27;d read some good reviews about it, and figured I might as well try it, so just a week after my Feria attempt (hoping my poor hair wouldn&#x27;t suffer too much from dying it again too soon) I slathered on Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color, Light Intense Auburn (R3), and hoped for the best. While putting the hair dye in I had to fight the urge to slightly freak out..when you&#x27;re putting this stuff in it&#x27;s ridiculously bright orange/red, like Bozo the Clown type red. I kept feeling the need to remind myself it doesn&#x27;t mean my hair is actually going to look like that just because the goop does, haha. It probably also didn&#x27;t help that my boyfriend kept staring at me funny.  While rinsing it out I noted that it takes FOREVER for the water to even begin to run clearer..it also looked like an extreme version of the shower scene from Psycho in there. I read that someone else said to just rinse until it&#x27;s mostly clear for this hair dye and then stop, so I did just that. After drying my hair I checked out my new color. WOW. That&#x27;s all I can say. It was the most fantastic, seriously super awesome red EVER. I thought to myself even if this hair dye only lasts a couple washes I&#x27;m still going to re-purchase in the future. It also hadn&#x27;t left my hair feeling ridiculously fried or anything (it felt quite nice actually!) so that was another plus.  It&#x27;s now 2 weeks later (I wanted to wait a while before writing a review so I could monitor how fast it fades). I only wash my hair every 2-3 days, and I use the John Frieda Radiant Red shampoo + conditioner (which I think has helped a little). My color has faded some, more so in the lengths than my roots but it&#x27;s actually still a lot redder than what my hair was when I used Feria&#x27;s Ruby Fusion, especially after that first wash. Ultimately I&#x27;m definitely going to be using this hair dye again, and again. For as long as I want red hair. Which given how awesome a red this dye turns my hair into should be quite a while! I would like to note though that it took like a week and a half before the water ran clear in the shower whenever I would wash my hair, that&#x27;s some crazy amount of pigment that must be in this dye. That being said, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it staining clothes etc though. But I would be leery about using white/light colored sheets etc right after using this dye, and definitely don&#x27;t use a light colored towel to dry your hair for a while.  All in all, this is a fantastic red hair dye if you want red hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair some shade of red for about 22 years. The options for home color have certainly improved in that time, and this brand is my all-time favorite so far. It&#x27;s as close to a professional color as I&#x27;ve ever had with a home color kit, and it&#x27;s economical. The gloves included aren&#x27;t that awesome, but the actual product is better than Feria, Nice N&#x27; Easy, or any of the other color systems on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews complain about the excess pigmentation that will come even after you&#x27;ve washed it out. That even happens with profesisonal haircoloring sometimes. So, if you do decide to go for this shade, or any of the reds in this line, make sure you put an old towel across your pillow at night. Otherwise, that&#x27;s an inconvenience I&#x27;m absolutely willing to put up with since the color is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;This is is longest-lasting red I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This worked for me and I have naturally black hair.  I have used it two times (initial application and reapplication a month later).  My hair was completely uncolored before I used the hair coloring.  The color didn&#x27;t fade as I expected it would.  I used the Garnier color safe shampoo and conditioner.  Be sure to leave it in for the required amount - at least.  Worked for me!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Very vibrant and color barely fades.  Fantastic!!</li>
    <li> With all hair dyes, the sun is a variable. Will my hair shine in the sun, or will it not look any different? I have used five different brands of hair dye, and none can compare to this. In a dark setting, the color is deep and still vibrant. In the light, it shines and glistens. Also, I have noticed that my ends always appear healthier after using this product. Thanks, Garnier.</li>
    <li> I have a natural brick colored hair ( medium to dark red and brown). I had dyed my hair black last year after an attempt to dye my hair red went wrong. Needless to say at this point I was worried about the damage I had done ( I have relaxed hair). Well It had been 8 months since my last dye and I had all but lifted the color. I heard that this was less damaging and did a great color on dark hair. So I googled and youtube this color for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets dark hair red.&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the lease damaging dyes I have ever used, and I left it on for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to get off of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not done right your roots will be really bright ( you can wash them and they even out to the same color as the rest of the head).&lt;br /&gt;It did not run clear even after three washes ( I use dark towels so not a big deal.</li>
    <li> My hair has been just about every shade of red you can imagine (from orangey strawberry blonde to deep burgundy) and this is hands-down the best color I have tried.  This distinctive shade has gotten me tons of complements from friends, strangers and even my stylist (plus the rest of the staff at the salon!).  Unlike most red shades that fade to orange or brown, this particular series has amazing staying power.  The only reason to do a touch-up is to cover my roots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note...&lt;br /&gt;(1) My hair is naturally a darker blonde/light brown and looks about a shade brighter than the model on the box when freshly dyed.  From what I know of others experiences with this shade, it is best suited for those whose natural hair color is medium blonde to medium brown. Those with dark hair tend to find that the color is less noticeable (often only showing up clearly in sunlight), unless they first lighten their hair.&lt;br /&gt;(2) This dye tends to run, A LOT.  During the coloring process, and for the next few showers, it is not uncommon for the water to run a pale red/pink.  This is due to the extra pigmentation they give this dye to penetrate darker hair-colors and does not mean that your hair color is noticeably fading (NOTE: Using cooler water will minimize the amount of pigment washing out).  I have been using this color for over a year now and have seen no visible change in the color as a result of this wash-out, but leaking color does tend to lead to issue 3...&lt;br /&gt;(3) Allowing wet hair to come into contact with fabric can lead to ruined towels, sheets or clothing.  If you want to avoid having your bathroom look like a murder scene, make sure to designate a particular towel as a \\&quot;hair towel\\&quot; and be sure to bring it with you if you are travelling (you don&#x27;t want to ruin friends&#x27;/family&#x27;s/hotels&#x27; towels accidentally).  Similarly, you will want to make sure to properly dry your hair during the first week or two before dressing in light colors or laying on light furniture/pillows.  (NOTE: the dye does seem to come out for the most part in the wash, assuming you do not saturate the fabric, so hope is not lost if you accidentally stain something).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Garnier Nutrisse devote for a long time, because their hair-dyes (and the conditioner they include in the kits) actually leave my hair feeling/looking healthier than they did before.  As compared to their other similar hues, this dye has had spectacular staying power and seems to look the most \\&quot;natural\\&quot; despite its vibrant shade.  Even professional stylists have asked where I&#x27;ve had my hair colored, because they cannot believe that it comes out of a box!</li>
    <li> Love this color! I don&#x27;t need to bleach my hair to make it a dark/med. auburn. Be warned: this is for if have dark hair, and the color is pretty bright. If you have natural light hair, I&#x27;d imagine this could turn very very bright ;) But it&#x27;s great this exists. Other red dyes have turned my hair very dark purply, but this one makes it a perfect auburn.</li>
    <li> Love to buy this product.  I really like this color. I recommend the subscribe and save use. It help out with the price.</li>
    <li> For years I have been using Clairol Herbal Essences Radiant Ruby (Paint The Town Red). Then it was discontinued &amp; becoming almost impossible to purchase even online. I refuse to purchase it from the few places that are still selling it as their prices are just as expensive as a salon. I tried Clairol Hydrience Tropic Burgundy and my hair turned out much too dark. After having removed this awful color today, for the first time I tried Carnier Ultra Nutrisse Light Intense Auburn Hair Color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am very pleased with my hair color now! It is the same exact shade as the Herbal Essences Radiant Ruby! This hair color also leaves my hair soft &amp; shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 things that I think Garnier should change about this product. One, instead of the color &amp; fruit oil coming in tubes &amp; packets, these 2 items should be placed in small bottles to make the mixing process easier. The conditioner should also come in a tube instead of in a foil packet. Much easier to use. Also, even though the package states that this is drip free, have an old towel or 2 on hand, as when you&#x27;re coloring your hair, this product certainly does tend to drip &amp; will stain everything.</li>
    <li> I went ahead and purchased this product, contrary to all the negatives it received.  I am so disappointed.  The red dye in this product would not wash away. It stained my pillow (had to lay a towel), even when my hair was dried. It stained my towel, and it stained my blouse.  I must agree with the other reviewers who claimed this product continued to wash off after numerous shampooing.  Stay away, unless you enjoy Stains.</li>
    <li> I found this product first in a discount store and once I used it the first time I knew I wouldn&#x27;t want to go with any other color.  I went back to the store and bout the last 2 boxes they had.  During the time I would recolor my hair I looked for this product in regular stores and was unable to find it anywhere!  Thankfully Amazon has EVERYTHING!  I now have it set up to ship to me regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have darker hair and you want to have a bright, vibrant, lasting auburn color this is the product for you!  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I usually use the nutrisse line for hair color but this was the first time I used the ultra. I use two different boxes and mix because the color I want is always somewhere in between.  This is the perfect red for me!!!! I have already subscribed to receive it monthly!</li>
    <li> Color came out almost as pictured, a bit more orange/brassy tones than I expected for a RV color. Still that may wash out as leftover color, but for now it does look great in sunlight or under bright overhead lighting, otherwise it&#x27;s still brunette with RV highlights making it look a deep darker burgundy brown in low lighting. I&#x27;d use this color again, though it was a lark, I had preferred 366 (garnier) and have had trouble finding that color, so thought I&#x27;d try something different. I wish Garnier Nutrisse would start making the fashion colors such as Navy Blue in this Ultra Color series, that&#x27;s my next experiment in Spring.</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair a few days ago, and while I like how the color looks, that&#x27;s the nicest part of my review.&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;ve rinsed my hair TWICE and it&#x27;s still not rinsing clear.  That&#x27;s 20 minute rinses.&lt;br /&gt;2. I can&#x27;t touch my now dry hair at all, because my hands turn orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This needs to be labeled \\&quot;temporary\\&quot;, not \\&quot;permanent\\&quot;.  It washes out fast, even with color-safe, sulfate-free shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as happy as  I am with the color, I will not buy this product, or any other from this line.  It feels like a waste of money.</li>
    <li> My wife loves my hair this color. I&#x27;m a natural brown and the color is just amazing. I get so many complements from the color this produces. Even my hair stylist can&#x27;t believe if came from a box. Not many men are brave enough to use this color, but I was feeling adventurist and glad I did:) The color lasts about 5-6 weeks before it begins to fade. Hair never feels dry or damaged as I only wash every 3 days (but rinse everyday) and use conditioner when washed and try to keep away from hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Packaged nicely no issues there. As far as the pruduct goes....LOVE THE COLOR!!!  I have very ethnic hair so it&#x27;s hard at times for me to find products that wont kill my hair. This product smells wonderful and left my hair soft! Lasts long (i do use the color treAtment shampoo and conditioner). I will definitely be purchasing this color again!</li>
    <li> I have locs and thick dark hair with grey specs.  I wanted a change and this did it for me - lovely color. Only down side is it needs &#x27;re-coloring&#x27; every 6 weeks or so and does stain towels.</li>
    <li> I bought this dye from safeway for 6.99 today and just tried it, it worked perfect I have light brown to blonde hair and this product made my hair RED I love it. The water ran clear in the rinse but I used warm water to make lather like instructed then I rinsed with cold water PERFECT. the only complaint I have is you can still smell it in my hair but that will go away. I fallowed all instruction and used the conditioner then before I dried my hair I cover the dyed portion in WEN and my hair looks great will def use this again.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown, almost black, hair and have always been searching for a way to get a good reddish tint to it. When I saw this I bought it knowing that it was made for dark hair, and I figured I&#x27;d try it and see. It came out exactly how I expected it, which was lighter, but not too much lighter, with a reddish tint. If you have dark hair and your desired result is what is shown on the box, I would suggest trying something else because it is highly unlikely that it will end that way. It does smell wonderful though!</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t rave about this dye enough.  I&#x27;ve tried salon dyes and many box red dyes, and nothing compares to this one.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years now, and I always get so many compliments, and the color it fades to leaves people asking all the time if I am a natural redhead! I naturally have dark brown hair, so not having to bleach my hair is great, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Pros: Long lasting (I have to dye because my ROOTS are showing, not because of fading), beautiful color, cheap, no bleaching, smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Cons: Does bleed for awhile (I&#x27;ve stained many towels with this dye for a few weeks, hah)</li>
    <li> I dont have a new wife but i love seeing my wife happy as a clam when she got her hair dye. Anything to make her happy and she looks gorgeous  as always.</li>
    <li> This red is dark without looking brown and bright without looking pink or orange.  Sounds impossible, but it looks red in a poorly lit room and vibrant in the sun.  It lightens dark hair beautifully and leaves your hair soft and smelling like the concentrated fruit oil included in the kit.  I wish I could buy a few gallons of that stuff for use as a deep conditioner and perfume.  It has amazing staying power in virgin hair and healthy treated hair, much better than any other red I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried them all from drug stores to Sally&#x27;s to salons.  Feria used to be my go to with its vibrant reds but the last few times they&#x27;ve been flat, dull and leave my hair feeling dry and straw like.  Garnier all the way!!!</li>
    <li> I love the color and it usually seems to last good on my hair but since I dyed it dark brown almost black it didn&#x27;t work as well but I still love this color</li>
    <li> My favorite color! Love that it works well with dark hair and I don&#x27;t have to bleach my hair beforehand!</li>
    <li> Love this color couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore</li>
    <li> iI have never been so happy with a hair color!  its VIBRANT! Red! I had already used clairol  (not permanent dye ). so it had..some..red in it..but was such a yukky looking brown red.... but i wanted something that would POP.. well this did it (nutrisse R3)&lt;br /&gt;It was a little messy...but it didn&#x27;t stain anything...what it did get on..i just sprayed a little of mr clean on let it sit for a few mins and washed off...it came right off leaving no stains at all.. A reviewer helped me out a bunch with her suggestion of her using a garbaage bag cutting a hole and put over her head..I didn&#x27;t get any of the dye on my shoulders arms etc! Great idea!&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair with John Frieda Radiant Red daily Shampoo (I also have the matching condtioner..but didnt need yet because i used the one that came in the box)..my hair is like satin! also suggestion from another reviewer ... i put  John Frieda radiant red color envy..color sealer...(you can use everyday ) on my wet hair (You leave in)  which also made my hair silky and i believe made the color be more vibrant!..People said it got on their clothes pillows etc the days afterwards but..I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all.....&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about the fading yet..I will UPDATE in a month or so...&lt;br /&gt;I def recommend this color...Im really happy &amp; so excited about this color!! I&#x27; had been a Blonde for 23 yrs...then went back to my real hair (golden Brown... not dyed.. i let the blonde grow out)for like 12 yrs...but then i lost my daughter and husband  :O*(  and after spending most of my life in bed grieving..one day woke and just wanted to see something diff so i went back to blonde..but while watching \\&quot;How I Met Your Mother\\&quot;  Lily on there had this awesome red/dark brown hair...it was stunning...so i took the plundge..easily at first using the non permanent hair dye of Clairol Natural Instincts #745 dark auburn...and I liked the red on me..that faded in less than a week..so I picked this up (R3) and never been happier! I keep hearing how hard it is to keep red hair...dreading that a bit...but i feel its worth it!  (  ps I  first dyed it with Nutrisse Dark Brown... Then  a week later I did the Clairol auburn/brown)&lt;br /&gt;Wish i knew how to upload pics to amazon..I would do so you could see how it came out  :O/&lt;br /&gt;Hope all reading this are as pleased as I with this product  :O)eep hearing how hard it is to keep red hair...dreading that a bit...but i feel its worth it!  (  ps I  first dyed it with Nutrisse Dark Brown...

    <li> My natural color is a medium, mousy brown. I went to the salon and requested red and got a color very close to black, which was not at all what I wanted. So I turned to the classy choice, boxed color. And I LOVE IT. My red is not nearly as bright as what the box proclaims, which is fine. It looks like a rich brown indoors and in the sun it is a bright, vibrant red. It also easily cleans up. I have found splotches of this on my bathroom floor a day later and was still able to wipe it up. However, as others have mentioned, this stuff bleeds out red for days afterwards. There is no &amp;#34;rinse until water runs clear&amp;#34;. I just rinse it out for 10ish minutes and use a dark towel and pillowcase that night. Red is tough upkeep so I figure there&#x27;s no harm in leaving a little color in overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have never gotten this many compliments on my hair color in my life. People frickin&#x27; love it.</li>
    <li> My hair is dark brown and this barely changed the color. Waste of time 😕</li>
    <li> My hair color always gets discontinued (I&#x27;m cursed), and when I lost my last version, I happened upon Nutrisse Ultra Color. While the cream itself is a little wetter than I&#x27;d prefer, the color is fantastic, and I won&#x27;t use any other permanent color at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair and am graying pretty much all over, and this works wonders to cover it. I use it for the full resistant gray time, and I am never disappointed. The color comes out similarly to the box picture, though it&#x27;s slightly darker (just as bright though). I constantly receive compliments on my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never go to a salon... not as long as Light Intense Auburn is around!</li>
    <li> I have naturally very dark brown hair and I&#x27;ve never been able to get something to stick or show up without going the route of bleaching it to hell (which I would never do). So I decided to give this box a chance as a last try and I was incredibly impressed. It&#x27;s been a MONTH since I dyed my hair and you can&#x27;t even see my roots! The color is still an intense red and it looks wonderful. I&#x27;m very very happy with it and would recommend 100%.</li>
    <li> This hair dye is awesome. I have never dyed my hair before  and was really nervous.  My hair feels supper soft and is teally shiny. Can see it as well as I wanted  but my hair is really dark black like jet black.I seems to take a couple of days for the color to come through to it&#x27;s  full potential. I will take that over a bunch of hair damage.</li>
    <li> I followed all directions completely, and it only turned spots in my hair an abnormal red color not even effecting the majority of my hair.</li>
    <li> But, I have never had SO many compliments in my LIFE!  The only problem that I have is that the quick fade. Butk the problem is likely just the &amp;#34;red problem&amp;#34;-- the molecule is too small to stick. Or, too big to absorb, Or something.</li>
    <li> color is very bright i got my hair done at a salon 3 weeks ago supposed to have been this color and it looks much better now that i re did it at home</li>
    <li> I think if you have light hair ( blonde, brown to no darker than medium brown) the color will be very true to the box but for me it didn&#x27;t turn out much like the box because I started out from a milk chocolate brunette and well I did think the color was pretty and it turned out some what tinted mostly, like a cherry tint on my brunette which isn&#x27;t bad but I had hoped for and expected a higher lift from dark to lighter rich red because it said it was for darker hair. However it was a nice color and I didn&#x27;t hate or regret it but if you think thicker textured hair and if your hair is longer than shoulder length 1. Buy two boxes to have enough for good saturation 2. Thicker hair needs more saturation so plan accordingly and realize it may not come out as vibrant red as depicted. Another thing I notice is the red is very light reflective and when you go out in the sun or even artificial light it will look more red. Not the best but very nice. Definitely worth a try</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve colored my hair golden blonde for years, and it&#x27;s past my shouders. I dye JUST the bottom 2 inches, darker brown, for some depth. It&#x27;s mostly golden blonde and just the bottom 2-3 inches are dark, for depth and contrast; my own funky creation. I also put a splash of dark brown in the middle of my bangs, and brown here and there on the bottom inch of the angled hair near my face. My goal: change my brown accents and bottom 2 inches to deep cherry red. My dyed golden blonde hair takes most any brown color really well....so I tried various \\&quot;root touch up\\&quot; kits called auburn..but they didn&#x27;t go RED really. Unless in sun? forget it. Well, I got a coupon for Garnier (they don&#x27;t have the root touch up size, I only need a little product) so I got the regular whole head size, \\&quot;light intense auburn R3\\&quot;. It looked really out there red, given I&#x27;m putting it against blonde hair (but over  brown tips).  I was shocked at the color of the product....pink orange! It is scary as another reviewer said, but I went with it knowing you can&#x27;t go by that. I put it over my dyed brown two inches at bottom, as planned, and over the brown dyed part of my bangs, AND, what the hay, I put some on bangs, blonde only, and some blonde tips of other parts of my hair, to see how red it would be over blonde AND over brown. I let 30 minutes or 35 go by..better longer then shorter I figured. LOVE LOVE. OHMY.  Yes, I rinsed forever. I use Wen conditioning shampoo only.. and my experience with Wen shampoo is color lasts forever. So, Im rinsing, and rinsing..and water is still reddish.. so I stopped. I figured, enough, I didn&#x27;t want to rinse it OUT, if that was happening. I think based on reviews, it does rinse red a long time, even at subsequent washings.  Then I blow dried my hair and WOW do I love it! In my bathroom light, I see the red EXACTLY like the box photo, over my brown tips.. they are nice cherry red in my bathroom light... and my bangs where I put it over my blonde only and some side tips,where blonde only..FABULOUS, fun, funky, (fake yes, who cares) funky red! not brassy.. just a fun bright red. But over the brown ends? Gorgeous. Rich..Love it. Can&#x27;t wait to go outside in sun tomorrow and see it. I spend a lot of time outdoors, so this should be fun . . and I love the red at the blonde bangs, too. I will buy this again. I will post as days go by, to update how it holds up brown and blonde with me, since I have both, and with my Wen shampoo, which usually stops fading (even when I want some color to fade in past, Wen keeps it). Reds are different, I know. I wash my hair every 3rd or 4th night...so we shall see. Check back, I&#x27;ll update.</li>
    <li> I swear I&#x27;ve used this before two years ago, but this time it continued to leach red everytime I washed my hair for weeks after! I don&#x27;t understand it.  I use the black in this brand and have never had that issue.  I love garnier products, just didn&#x27;t love this one and I bought &amp; used 5 boxes since my hair is super thick and long.  :-(</li>
    <li> I have naturally light brown hair. I used this dye and my color came out a shade darker than my natural LIGHT color. This color came out LIGHT BROWN. AND NOT EVEN LIGHT BROWN, BUT A BLOTCHY MESS OF DIFFERENT UNDERTONES. WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> I am on my second use of this product, and the results are excellent.  I have very dark brown hair, that looks very lifeless without color, and many grays mixed in.  My overall color comes out pretty close to the box.  Since I am lazy and waited overlong to re-do the color, I was even getting compliments on the faded color weeks and weeks later.  Absolutely everyone who saw me had something good to say about the color.  A first for me.  I also want to warn everyone that the rinsing out process is never complete the first time.  I rinsed in my shower literally till I couldn&#x27;t stand up any longer, and still the water wasn&#x27;t running clear.  But once it was dry, the color didn&#x27;t rub off, and it pretty much is done rinsing on the 1st shampoo after.  So, don&#x27;t use your favorite towel.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed really dark brown hair and this color showed up without me having to bleach it. The color lasted for a few weeks so and I had little damage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted purple hair. What I got with this dye was red.&lt;br /&gt;I am naturally medium auburn, and the resulting color was not remotely violet. More of a bright auburn, with no purple or even purple tones.&lt;br /&gt;While I like the color and it&#x27;s flattering on me, it&#x27;s just not what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Ive read reviews on several sites and it seems this shade of dye ends up intense red on almost everyone. Flawed.</li>
    <li> Love this color...true red indeed&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003B2QCK6 Garnier Nutrisse Haircolor, R3 Light Intense Auburn Nourishing Color Creme Permanent]]&lt;br /&gt;I have really mixed feeling about this product. Am a faithful user of Garnier products and loved the 100% Reds the best. When that was discontinued I had to find my next red hair fix.&lt;br /&gt;I have about 50% grey medium thickness hair and color every month.&lt;br /&gt;The product was simple to apply and yes, made the tub look like a gore-fest, but those of us who are red heads are used to that. What I was not used to was rinsing and rinsing and rinsing- after 45 minutes I gave up. Had to wear dark clothes and hoped I didnt sweat for a full month. Every time I shampoo&#x27;d more color would come out.&lt;br /&gt;Strangely the intensity of color did not fade too much during the month!&lt;br /&gt;So I have to give it an A for color but in no way will I ever use it again. It got all over everything for a LONG time and was not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> I used this product before. I have dark brown hair and when I applied this die. It looks very nice on my hair afterwards. Very nice color red. Everyone thinks its im a natural. Red head. It&#x27;s worth it and a great buy. I reccomend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really love this color.  My hair is almost black and this colors it a nice deep wine red color.  My favorite part about it is how it fades out.  As it fades out, the red gets brighter and more noticeable.  People really like it.  I leave the color in for about 25 minutes and then rinse it out.  It bleeds red in the shower for a couple weeks in my experience, but it isn&#x27;t bothersome. I probably wouldn&#x27;t use white or any light colored towels or bedsheets/pillowcases for a couple weeks after if you take showers at night.  My hair is a tad bit coarse after using this color but that goes away in a couple of days.  I am really happy with this color and will continue to buy it for as long as I can.</li>
    <li> My fault, I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough. This particular product is made for dark hair and mine was light when I  put it in, so it faded rapidly.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t even change the color!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to dye my medium brown hair a more vibrant and unnatural looking red but instead, I decided to try this as I prefer a natural look any day. The color definitely worked and that&#x27;s a rarity for me because whenever I try to use a lighter color hair dye, it almost never comes. The color itself was a bit more brown than expected. I&#x27;m unsure why that is but it&#x27;s slightly annoying because I was hoping it&#x27;d make a significant difference but instead, it only looks slightly red tinted. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair but that&#x27;s the result I got. It&#x27;s most definitely red but it isn&#x27;t as red as I thought it&#x27;d be. Either way, good product and it worked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color for 1yr now and it wears well ( I have light brown hair to start). I buy it with the subcribe/save program and don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.  I get many compliments on the color.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply and the vibrance really does hold up well from the kinds I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
    <li> Inlove with this color, my hair was light red and when i use this color everyone compliment me...</li>
    <li> Product turned out really well I like how it turned out it.It could of turned out better but it turned out pretty good I like this product it is better than any product I have used so far!It got almost all my hair.But that was just because we didn&#x27;t use enough dye at the time.But I like the color it&#x27;s awesome I love it!</li>
    <li> I have very dark hair, naturally. It&#x27;s almost black. I love red hair, but have always had a hard time finding a red that will actually show up. This is the best I&#x27;ve found. I can actually notice a difference, and not just a subtle hue. You really need to work quickly and blend well with this stuff, though. Or it will end up a bit patchy. Also, its grey coverage isn&#x27;t the best, but suitable.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to dye my hair a bright red color for a while and this color did more than satisfy initially. On my light brown hair it was this bright burgundy color that I genuinely like more than my natural. However, I needed to dye it back to my natural for my senior pictures and it is nothing short of impossible to remove after having had it this color for almost a year. We initially tried dying it on top of the red but the dye washed out and did not hold at all. If you plan on returning to your natural color at some point later on this color is not for you. It is a beautiful color but a pain to try to remove.</li>
    <li> I have used this product (this color, Pomegranate) 3 times - the first time without success.  I only color my hair about 2 to 3 times a year - I&#x27;m bad, I know.  Anyway, I like the red tone this color gives my naturally dark brown hair.  The color is so rich and vibrant.  I am African-American with natural hair (no relaxer) and get AWESOME results everytime.  HOWEVER, I do have to leave the product on for about 2 hours to achieve my desired result; I am aware the instructions indicate to leave on for an hour tops, but when I did that the first time, the color did not take AT ALL.  So the second time I used it, I left it on longer and... SUCCESS!!  The conditioning treatment that comes with this product is PHENOMENAL!  It leaves my hair so soft, manageable and - most of all - detangled!  I wish I could get the conditioner alone as it seems different than the Color Shield conditioner.  My hair does not get dry with this product.  As my hair is getting longer and oh so much thicker, I find I need a bottle and a half to process all of my hair.  My hair is VERY THICK and past my shoulder blades when straightened.  I like how soft my hair feels after using this.  I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to color their hair at home.</li>
    <li> Love Garnier Nutrisse! Easy to put on hair, I&#x27;ve used salon products to cut back costs of dying etc.  But this was inexpensive and I had awesome results. The color is great! For my hard to color dark hair. (Ethnic thick hair with grey)&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair soft and mangeable! I have recieved a ton of compliments! Will get again!</li>
    <li> I have black hair and I&#x27;ve never dyed my whole head of hair before. The box claimed that even black hair would get a nice color. Now, since this was my first time dying (alone I might add), I didn&#x27;t cover all of my hair properly. However, I left the dye in longer than I should have, but even then the color could only be seen if there was bright light. My hair was just barely a reddish brown. I think that if my hair were lighter it would have worked better, but I guess if you have black hair like me, it won&#x27;t work as well as you wish.</li>
    <li> its been about a month and it&#x27;s completely been washed out.  At first it was really pretty but it just faded with each shower.</li>
    <li> When I applied this product, I still had color from a previous dye in my hair. The previous dye was applied November 28th, 2012. The Garnier Nutrisse color was applied July 14th, 2013. My natural dark brown, almost black roots were showing through the November dye job. I applied the Garnier Nutrisse dye and left it in for 30 minutes as the instructions said (my hair is both coarse and hard to dye). I then rinsed it out after the half hour was up and applied the conditioner. When I dried my hair, I found that my dark roots were still visible. The only part that was red was the part that had been dyed back in November (it was a brownish red color). The box says that it is made for darker hair, but that was not the case with me. I believe that in order to get the color that you want, you would have to have lighter hair. Not exactly blonde, but a medium or light brown to get the results that are on the box. I&#x27;m not sure if I would&#x27;ve gotten different results had I left it on longer, but I did not want to surpass the suggested time in fear of damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 units and the color result was awesome. My natural color is black so I recommend you girls :)</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL color at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I usually color my hair every 5 weeks.  I&#x27;ve used other reds before from different brands of dye.  A busy spring meant that I waited 7 weeks to color my hair after using this product.  To my excellent surprise, the color stayed true for almost 6 weeks.  Yes, my dark brown roots were a tell-tale reminder that it was time to dye my hair again, but the red was still fairly vibrant.  Thanks to other reviewers who suggested the importance of using the coldest water possible when shampooing. Ladies, it&#x27;s important to use hairdye on unwashed hair.  For me that means I wash my hair at minimum 24 hours prior to coloring, with no gels or mousses. I use the garnier shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.  I also condition-wash my hair instead of shampooing at least once weekly. These were helpful ways to prevent the red from fading.  I need 2 boxes for my almost waist-length hair.  I actually don&#x27;t mind the smell at all, and for the most part my hair is fairly soft afterwards. And, as a plus, I&#x27;d have to say that my color actually very closely matches that in the picture on the box.</li>
    <li> My hair is rather long (about halfway down my back) and extremely thick. I ran out of color long before I could cover all of my hair. However, I loved the color that came out. I will buy this again, next time I&#x27;ll just have to buy two boxes.</li>
    <li> The directions were easy to follow and it worked well. It was (as many have noted) impossible to rinse clear, and I tried for over 40 minutes of straight rinsing before giving up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair started with dirty-blonde/light-brown roots and the rest was faded dyed red. I applied starting at the roots and then brought it through to my tips and it covered the roots wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resulting color was vibrant and very pretty. It looked very nice in the sun and I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after the next wash (in cold water, with shampoo and conditioner made specifically for red hair) it lost a lot of that vibrancy. It&#x27;s still red, just not intense anymore. I&#x27;m a little bummed because I loved it so much initially. Maybe I&#x27;ll try again and leave it in longer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, great kit, great conditioner, great coverage, great initial color... not loving the fast fade.</li>
    <li> My favorite color of all time. Great for those of us with dark hair that want an intense red!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found this on Amazon. But, unfortunately I went to my local Walgreens today to find it gone. CVS no longer has it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I find a damn hair color that WORKS on my thick ass dark hair that doesn&#x27;t fade and rinses completely, and it&#x27;s being discontinued. I&#x27;m THRILLED that Amazon has it, even if I&#x27;m a bit spooked to be ordering dye through the mail with my textbooks. God bless the internets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stock up, ladies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I can subscribe and get it autoshipped?! THE INTERNETS. IT&#x27;S MAGIC.</li>
    <li> got a compliment on my hair</li>
    <li> I dye my hair 4 or 5 times a year. I&#x27;ve used Garnier before. I have never had a worse experience with box dye. My hair was soaked with dye, yet the result was splotchy. Some parts of my hair are completely dye free. Again, all of my hair was covered with dye, so there is no reason for some sections to be intense red (clown red is not auburn!), others orangey, others burgundy, and others brown. If that wasn&#x27;t enough, I put a towel on my shoulders while I waited on the conditioner. I then covered my pillow with that towel and slept on it. I woke up with a hot red rash on my face. I have never had an allergic reaction to box dye, shampoo or conditioner. Now I have to spend $70+ dollars to get this professionally fixed before I stand up as a bridesmaid in two  weeks.</li>
    <li> this hair dye looks great at first but after a while it starts to fade and weeks later i still had red hair dye coming out of my hair but i like the color of how bright it is in the light but i would probably not buy this dye again.</li>
    <li> I have dyed my hair in red tones for the past five years.  I decided to go bold this fall and that is when I found the Garnier for dark hair.  I used this product on 10/04/12 and initially loved the results, it was bold without being garish.  One month later, the color is gone and after shampooing, my towel is still coming out with orange streaks on it.  It certainly not permanent color.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Plenty other companies with an intense auburn that does the trick.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I used this brand auburn.  The first couple of weeks it was very bright.  I did get many compliments.  I prefer a more natural looking color.  This was a bit bright for me, but it is lasting a long time.  After about 2-3 weeks the color toned down to a color I liked better.</li>
    <li> Color is beautiful &amp; it&#x27;s pretty bright even on darkish hair. I would recommend lighting a very little if you have super dark hair.</li>
    <li> I am Chinese with very thick, pitch-black hair and have always wanted darkish, but vibrantly cherry red hair. I have gotten my hair dyed professionally many times and have always been told that if I wanted red hair, I would have to bleach my hair first because putting red hair dye on black hair will never work. I insisted that I did not want to bleach my hair, so they would dye it and it would always come out black with the tiniest hint of red, or a weird brownish color and they would say something along the lines of \\&quot;See? I told you so.\\&quot; I have wasted SO much money trying to get \\&quot;professionals\\&quot; to get my hair red and they have consistently failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I decided to try this dye (using the lightest red color possible) and the results were AMAZING!! It was exactly the tint of red I wanted. It is a red that doesn&#x27;t look fire engine red or too fake - it&#x27;s a blended cherry color that looks natural. It was a very easy, but messy application (as all box dyes are) and I got a lot on my skin, but it easily wipes away with a damp cloth. I waited only 30 minutes before washing out. Be warned - all of the color won&#x27;t come out within the first wash unless you wash your hair for an extremely long time. I probably went one or two days with my hair still smelling of dye and the water still ran red after my third wash, but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much. I just slept with a towel on the pillow for a couple days. The color does fade pretty quickly to a medium brown (I would say after a couple months), but I still have yet to find a good shampoo that can keep the color in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is so beautiful I will buy this dye again and again until I&#x27;m sick of having cherry red hair (which won&#x27;t be for a very long time!) I was paying over $60 to get my hair dyed professionally and never got the color I wanted, and this dye only costs $6. I would definitely recommend this dye to anybody with black hair!</li>
    <li> Great price and great product. It is The perfect color! I love this color, i give it two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I have not used this color but have used this product and love it. i recommend to people all the time.</li>
    <li> The only hair color that will work with my dark extremely stubborn hair.</li>
    <li> I was all set on a nice deep auburn for the winter. I have naturally dark brown hair, which is what the product is recommended for. Followed instructions to a T and my hair is PINK! Burgundy-ish pink clown hair is NOT what I was going for! I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally black (almost blue black) and this color gives me the most beautiful shade of red.  Think Debra Messing red.  It&#x27;s a deep, rich cherry that complements my olive skin.  I was surprised to read another person with black hair did not get good results.  Maybe my hair is just more porous???  Whatever the reason, I get complimented by total strangers and even several hair stylists.  Keep in mind the shade of red you get will depend on your starting color.  Mine does not come out like the box and I didn&#x27;t expect it too.  It&#x27;s a shade deeper.  If you have lighter hair it will probably be a more vibrant, true red.  I should also say that I have about 10% gray.  This colors the gray to a light, coppery red.  It looks like I have highlights.  I was worried it would make it pink but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not bad, in fact, I almost don&#x27;t notice it and I have allergies, so that is saying something.  The product itself is easy to mix and goes on thin.  It&#x27;s not a thick texture so be careful of drips. After I wash it out and dry it, my hair is very soft and shiny.  This is quite a feat considering I tend to have dull hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.  Garnier, please don&#x27;t ever stop making this amazing color for us dark haired people.</li>
    <li> I have medium to dark brown hair. I love dying my hair red so for about 10 years I&#x27;ve been trying every red hair dye I can find to find the perfect one. Usually the color washes out within a week. I was thrilled when after the first time using the R3 red color my hair was a beautiful vibrant red and even more thrilled when it lasted way over a month! I thought I had found the most perfect red hair dye. Since then I&#x27;ve dyed my hair twice with the same color. For some reason it doesn&#x27;t get as vibrant anymore. There is usually a lot of red still in it from before so maybe it works better on brown and not red hair. The color still lasts for a few months before I have to dye it again so for that it&#x27;s worth it and I&#x27;ll continue using it until I can afford a regular colorist. It&#x27;s definitely the best boxed red hair dye that I&#x27;ve found in the past decade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - If you have thick or long hair you&#x27;ll need two boxes!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
    <li> Previously I used garnier&#x27;s ginger spice and loved it but cannot find it anymore so I thought I would try this &#x27;auburn&#x27;.  I had not died my hair for several months and had even coverage with the dye on my hair but when I washed it out not only was it not auburn but it was streaky. The end result is a very bright (in some areas) fake red with streaks where the dye did not take. I&#x27;m hoping it washes out quickly.</li>
    <li> I am constantly dyeing my hair different shades of red and this one is now my favorite. Whenever dyeing reds I bleach my hair before so that I can get the most out of the red. When I bleached then dyed with this color my hair turned bright, bright red, brighter than Ronald McDonald&#x27;s red hair. I had to redye it the next day with a brown overlay and the color that came out was gorgeous. That&#x27;s where the first plus comes in for this product; Even after a bleach kit and the dye, my hair was still willing to take the brown dye the next day. The dye in this is incredibly smooth for hair. After growing it out and dyeing my hair again, this time without the bleach, I got a beautiful red that was better than the one before. If you&#x27;re looking for an intense auburn red then look no further; this is your product. Just do NOT bleach before.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Very good new product, maybe because it has oil in it? I would likecto get again. I saw it in a magazine and found it in target.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair with the medium brown color 3 days ago. The biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed is how much faster my hair gets oily after washing, and for someone with naturally oily hair already, that&#x27;s a huge pain. I can&#x27;t go more than half a day now before my hair gets greasy and gross feeling. The box also says 100% grey coverage, but it did not work for the few grey hairs I have. As for the color, it did nothing to change the color of my hair. My natural hair color is pretty close to this, but still, anytime I&#x27;ve dyed my hair this color using other brands there is always a difference. I know others have said it worked for them on the 2nd or 3rd try, but I honestly can&#x27;t justify spending more money on something that makes my hair look and feel like crap. I&#x27;d rather buy something that I know works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a bright \\&quot;Lucy\\&quot; red for sometime now and this one fits the bill.  It has a slight pinkish cast and really pops.  There is nothing natural looking about it which at this point in my life suits me just fine.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see until I got it in the mail that it was for &amp;#34;Darker Hair Only&amp;#34;.  Whatever, I&#x27;m just desperate for something as red as the extremely red shade in the (sadly discontinued) Herbal Essences haircolor line, and something not involving Manic Panic&#x27;s &amp;#34;semi-permanent&amp;#34; nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a success.  My hair is still healthy, it came out candy-apple red, it has stayed that way after two weeks and four washes in hot water, and random people tell me how awesome my hair is.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful color and it makes your hair in better condition than it started!!!  I follow the directions, do it myself and Amazing color happens!!!  Very fade resistant and an excellent Amazon Value!!! I subscribed and saved even more as an Amazon Mom! Now I will get one a month without having to reorder it!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair a few days ago, and it&#x27;s true you have to rinse it for a very long time.  I washed it for the first time since dying it and there was orange everywhere.  The color?  Still not sure.  It&#x27;s a mixture of burgundy, oranges, and in the sun...pink.  Kind of cool, but not at all natural.  Plan on keeping it a few more days to see if it grows on me.  Was hoping for a deeper burgundy, that I usually get from nice and easy.  But that fades in a few washes.  My hair is naturally a medium brown, so maybe it was too light for this kind of color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve colored my hair for over a dozen years and have had salon color as well, and I have used Garnier Nutrisse dark blond colors several times. This color is a nightmare. I have never had such a horrible experience - Garnier Nutrisse R3 Light Intense Auburn RUNS. And RUNS. After 2 weeks my hair color still runs pink every time I take a shower and shampoo. I went running and my head got drenched in sweat, when it reached my shirt, orange-pink color stained my shirt. I have used lots of reds and have never had anything happen like this. I searched on Google and sure enough, you will find LOTS of stories about how Garnier Nutrisse red hair color runs and keeps bleeding, weeks after it&#x27;s done. I&#x27;m done with this company. I will never buy any Garnier Nutrisse hair color product again.</li>
