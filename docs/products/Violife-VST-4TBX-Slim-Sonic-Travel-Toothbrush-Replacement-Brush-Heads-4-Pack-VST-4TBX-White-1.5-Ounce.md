      <li>Great deal!  </li>
      <li>These replacement brushes work great and are well-priced.</li>
      <li>They are compact but do a great job</li>
      <li>The Violife toothbrush is great for travel.</li>
      <li>but I know they&#x27;ll be as good as the brush that&#x27;s on my toothbrush now.</li>
      <li>Love these toothbrushes, great for travel.</li>
      <li>Fit toothbrush great.</li>
      <li>So happy to find these available thru Amazon.  </li>
      <li>but the brush itself works great and is better than a full size Sonic toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Not their fault. :)</li>
      <li>and you can put the top on and take it with you without fear of gunk getting on it in your purse or bag.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>We love our sonic travel toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>So glad I could find replacement heads</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight</li>
      <li>doesnt fit as well as it should</li>
      <li>These are the standard head that come with the toothbrush, so they&#x27;re great.</li>
      <li>They fit my Violife toothbrush</li>
      <li>The brush does leave my teeth with that gone to the dentist office clean.</li>
      <li>Arrived promptly, fit right.</li>
      <li>I really like this toothbrush and now that my dentist gave me a A+ at my last checkup I truly believe that the Slim Sonic is a great tool for dental health.  </li>
      <li>Now I have a very pretty &amp; slim brush for my purse and traveling.  </li>
      <li>They are good and will do the job, but small brush heads are better for gum health.  </li>
      <li>exactly what I needed to replace original that came with a gift</li>
      <li>This is a great little replacement set for your sonic toothbrush by Violife Slim Sonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hope this info is useful.</li>
      <li>Great way to update the toothbrush and very affordable compared to other websites.</li>
      <li>But when it arrived, it was exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>Just as described - thanks!</li>
      <li>Still, they are smaller than most of the toothbrush heads on the market.</li>
      <li>Good price and long lasting.</li>
      <li>It was refreshing to have a new brush head to do the proper job</li>
      <li>The shipping was very delayed on this (try a month or two).  </li>
      <li>These are very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so much</li>
      <li>Not much to say, they fit our toothbrushes,</li>
      <li>The price is good, especially considering it&#x27;s a replacement head for an electric toothbrush, and the bristles on the replacements are the same level of soft vs hard as the original head.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the only one he wants to use!  </li>
      <li>My adult son loves his</li>
      <li>My order came faster than expected (there was a back-order at the time I purchased) and right on time for my summer vacation trip.  </li>
      <li>The smaller brush can get in the hard to reach places better.</li>
      <li>I always have to mess with the chamber awhile to get it right, but that could just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish the brush heads were the same small size as the original brush head on the fiolife slim sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>It is a small brush so it fits nicely in your moth and will reach those hard to get teeth in the back of your mouth even if you have a small/petite mouth.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>

<li> I feel like these brush heads last anywhere from 30-60 days depending on how hard you brush.</li>
<li> You always need  replacement  every few months.</li>
<li> No more sweaters on my teeth!&lt;br</li>

    <li> Met expectations for use with brushed.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and product was as expected</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, as advertised, and a great price!</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Good price and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I feel like these brush heads last anywhere from 30-60 days depending on how hard you brush. The toothbrush came with two, so you&#x27;ll need this set soon.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize such a small electric tooth-brush existed till I accidentally found the toothbrush at an outlet store.  Now I have a very pretty &amp; slim brush for my purse and traveling.  These replacement brushes work great and are well-priced.</li>
    <li> We love our sonic travel toothbrushes.  My adult son loves his so much it&#x27;s the only one he wants to use!  These are the standard head that come with the toothbrush, so they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> This is a great little replacement set for your sonic toothbrush by Violife Slim Sonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;1. I find each one last about a month. I guess how long they last for you would depend on how often and how vigorously you brush.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is a small brush so it fits nicely in your moth and will reach those hard to get teeth in the back of your mouth even if you have a small/petite mouth.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s light weight and you can put the top on and take it with you without fear of gunk getting on it in your purse or bag.&lt;br /&gt;4. The brush does leave my teeth with that gone to the dentist office clean. :) No more sweaters on my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;5. These are very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;1. I have noticed that a bristle or two may come out when brushing from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;2. Changing the batteries can be a challenge. I always have to mess with the chamber awhile to get it right, but that could just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price I would give it a try.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  There is nothing else to say about toothbrushes!  One two, three, four, five, six. seven, eight.</li>
    <li> Fit toothbrush great.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, they fit our toothbrushes,</li>
    <li> I bought the Violife sonic toothbrush for travel.  It came with one replacement head, but I was thinking ahead and bought this pack.  Will last through the year as I travel and change heads about 1x per month.  The toothbrush it&#x27;s self is so much smaller than the sonic I use at home.  It&#x27;s not quite as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; but I think it does an exceptable  job.  I also bring along a spare battery or two just in case.  Hope this info is useful.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet but I know they&#x27;ll be as good as the brush that&#x27;s on my toothbrush now.</li>
    <li> Product received as listed. It did not fit my toothbrush very well but I think I have a slightlydifferent model. Not their fault. :)</li>
    <li> I wish the brush heads were the same small size as the original brush head on the fiolife slim sonic toothbrushes.  They are good and will do the job, but small brush heads are better for gum health.  Still, they are smaller than most of the toothbrush heads on the market.</li>
    <li> It was refreshing to have a new brush head to do the proper job</li>
