      <li>Glad I found these!</li>
      <li>Love this product, I have been using it for years!</li>
      <li>Glad I purchased this!</li>
      <li>These are excellent replacement combs for my blow dryer I have several.</li>
      <li>Great Quality ànd Fast delivery</li>
      <li>I just wish that the attachment was more durable and the teeth on the combs weren&#x27;t so easy to break on thicker hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s doing a fine job.</li>
      <li>Always try to buy replacements for my blow dryers, surely the first ones will break!</li>
      <li>Accurately described &amp; immediately shipped.</li>
      <li>I ordered these to fit my 1600 watt Vidal Sassoon dryer.</li>
      <li>Great Price and a necessary item.</li>
      <li>I love my Hot N Gold Dryer but could never find the comb replacements in the beauty supply stores.</li>
      <li>Actually, the recipient indicated that the ones that came with the blow dryer did a good job of separating and straightening the hair.  </li>
      <li>Keep these handy so that if yours breaks you have an extra on hand.  </li>
      <li>i thinks thats the point right.</li>

      <li>The Gold N Hot 2pc comb set was just what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>these are sharp as pins, I will have to try to smooth them out before using them, by smoothing each tooth separately with a fine nail file.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>As pictured and shipped fast.</li>
      <li>My hair is very curly  </li>
      <li>I will keep them, as eventually I will need them for the newer dryer, but I will have to order again, trying to get the right ones, with a straight back.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed, and order extra to have on hand.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I have two of them, and had lost the wide tooth comb attachment for the older one that I carry when traveling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these combs before and they just break easily, but like the idea that they practically straighten your hair while it&#x27;s drying your hair especially the thin comb.</li>

    <li> I bought this item as a supplemental gift--I also bought the blow dryer--and the recipient just loved them.  It&#x27;s always good to have replacement combs on hand.them. They appear to be sturdy.  Actually, the recipient indicated that the ones that came with the blow dryer did a good job of separating and straightening the hair.  I suspect that these will work as well.</li>
    <li> Did not fit blow dryer</li>

    <li> Wonderful!  This attachment was perfect fit.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Perfect timing.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to fit my 1600 watt Vidal Sassoon dryer. I have two of them, and had lost the wide tooth comb attachment for the older one that I carry when traveling. It is labeled \\&quot;1600\\&quot; but these combs did not fit. These combs are curved and fit my newer hair dryer..not the one which I needed the new attachments for. I will keep them, as eventually I will need them for the newer dryer, but I will have to order again, trying to get the right ones, with a straight back. One other issue...these are sharp as pins, I will have to try to smooth them out before using them, by smoothing each tooth separately with a fine nail file. It&#x27;s a pain in the rear to have to do it, but I&#x27;ve done it before with these combs.</li>
    <li> Keep these handy so that if yours breaks you have an extra on hand.  As pictured and shipped fast. Fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> it is what I ordered and they fit and work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this item because it did not fit my dryer. There was no indication that it would not be a match for the same name product dryer.</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly  These dryer combs help me to get my desired look</li>
    <li> Great Quality ànd Fast delivery</li>
    <li> These are excellent replacement combs for my blow dryer I have several.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have been using it for years! They fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works as described and cheaper here.</li>
