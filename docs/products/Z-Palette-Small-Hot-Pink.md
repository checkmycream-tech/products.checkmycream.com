    <li> Just as described. Very sturdy. I will purchase again in the future. ;)</li>
    <li> Great size, perfect for the eyeshadow samples I receive in my subscription boxes.</li>
    <li> Great for travel and speedy delivery. Easy to fill for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this Z Palette, great for storing my Makeup Geek &amp; MAC eyeshadows. I was disappointed it did not come with the magnets like it says it did in the description and picture. I had to order the magnets separately. Great for traveling. Love this product, just disappointed with seller.</li>
    <li> I was disapointed with the size. It does say small however.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly with any brands of shadows!!!! It&#x27;s small fit perfectly in my bag no much space require!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Appears good quality, holds pans very good</li>
    <li> Love z-palettes and the pink is so cute!</li>
    <li> I like this, it&#x27;s way smaller than I expected but it&#x27;s ok. It holds about 8 of my square eye shadow pans.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have ordered the medium, don&#x27;t know how anybody uses this it fits almost no makeup, yo can barely fit a MAC blush pan and two MAC shadow pans... Pitiful</li>
    <li> I use this with eyeshadow from Make Up Geek.</li>
    <li> I love Z-Palette!  I bought this palette to carry basic eyeshadow neutrals while I&#x27;m on-the-go.</li>
    <li> Very practical, but very small</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this purchase. It does what it says. It was especially nice to have the magnets stickers included because I definitely needed them. There really isn&#x27;t much to say. I depotted a morphe brushes eyeshadow palette and was able to fit 9 shadows in this z palette. I even had extra magnet stickers left over. Although I probably could make something sufficient for cheaper this was worth the money at the time. I like the smaller palettes. I wear makeup most when I travel and I need it to be portable and not in those large palettes. No complaints. would buy again.</li>
    <li> Cute. Functional. Stores eyeshadow pans as expected.</li>
    <li> quick shipping, as described</li>
    <li> I had ordered this item on the 9th of November thinking that I was getting what was pictured. Boy was I wrong! The palette that I got was a lot smaller than the one that I ordered online. I would like the product that I ordered--not a smaller version. I either want a refund or the actual product. This is ridiculous...It was a birthday present for my cousin...now its going to be late. THANKS FOR NOTHING. Not to mention that there is no other way to contact the seller. Really n o t happy.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004L5QTT6 B004L5QTT6]]</li>
    <li> I have a larger z palette but this one is perfect for travel. It holds 9 MAC shadows which is just the right size/amount to travel with. The pink is very vibrant. Love this!</li>
    <li> Great for traveling. I put my MAC pans in there as well as Anastasia banana powder and a contour color. It makes it so easy!!! Shipping was done very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I made this Purchase.</li>
    <li> I wish they were so expensive or I&#x27;d get the big one</li>
    <li> Holds nine full size shadows. Great for travel! It&#x27;s very sleek</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I love this little palette. The color is so cute and the magnetic base is perfect for my MakeupGeek eyeshadow pans (the palette fits 9 in total). The size is perfect for anyone who only has a small collection of eye shadows or wants to build a small palette of colors (I included a size comparison alongside my iphone 5). It also comes with metal stickers for any eyeshadow/blush pans that won&#x27;t magnetize to stick to the palette.</li>
    <li> although small....it can fit over eight Makeup Geek eye shadows.</li>
    <li> everything falls and make mess :(</li>
    <li> Great for combining makeup pots into one case. The magnets are strong enough to hold the make up in place by not so strong that it is hard to pull them up when you need to change out an item. It is cardboard but strong cardboard, I would just take caution if packing this in a checked bag at the airport. There is a magnet closure so I have never had pop open in a bag, though I don&#x27;t carry it around in my purse. I will be purchasing the larger one(s) for my professional kit to help keep me organized.</li>
    <li> Very small get the larger one</li>
    <li> Love the small Z pallet. I have several Trish shadows that fit in her customizable planners and I purchased several pods without the case from Mac to start my Z pallet. The Small Z pallet is perfect for travel. I haven&#x27;t learned to depot yet but I hate when you have to buy makeup in bulky containers.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Small amd cute, perfect for your favorite eyeshadow quads.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Great size for my purse or traveling love the fastest of my delivery !!!</li>
    <li> I actually love this product, I saw a youtube tutorial from Jaclyn Hill and she use this Z-palletes because she like to customize her own eyeshadows, so I decided it to try one for myself,  and its sooo perfect, you can take it everywhereee.. I highly recommend, and the price is perfect... I use it only for 2 highlights. ANASTASIA BEVERLY HILLS &amp; MAC EMPHAZIZE.... u can c in the picture that MAC its bigger... and still I have room for another 2... its small but great size :)</li>
    <li> I bought some eye shadows and blushes from Makeup geek and they fit perfectly in my Z palette. The Makeup geek products already come in magnetic pans which is great. Good item for organizing.</li>
