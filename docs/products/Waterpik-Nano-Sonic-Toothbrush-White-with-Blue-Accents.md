      <li>I love Waterpik products and was hoping this would be just as excellent a product as their others, but this is a joke.</li>
      <li>Works really good</li>
      <li>I must say that it isn&#x27;t  anywhere as good as the cheaper oral B brush.  </li>
      <li>Love this brush!</li>
      <li>I liked it</li>
      <li>I wanted to try an electric toothbrush to see if I liked it.</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>But for travel use, it&#x27;s a nice choice, and certainly better than just carrying a manual brush.</li>
      <li>Works great and replacement heads very reasonable.</li>
      <li>The brush head seems great, at first.</li>
      <li>Super Pros: Compact!!</li>
      <li>Its very gentle on the gums as well!!!  </li>
      <li>I think this works better than the colgate brushes and are cheaper.</li>
      <li>I got this Nano-Sonic toothbrush as a freebie included with the last Waterpik I bought, and I think it is the best electronic toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>I love the Waterpik  brand.</li>
      <li>Its slim and sleek compared to most battery operated toothbrush you&#x27;ll find at a brick and mortar store.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had many.</li>
      <li>I got it home and fell in love.  </li>
      <li>The toothbrush is gentle but yet very effective at cleaning your teeth.</li>
      <li>I have never been able to get comfortable with Philips Sonicare toothbrushes although my dental hygienist recommends them strongly (and keeps trying to sell me one!).  </li>
      <li>I have no idea whether it&#x27;s as effective as its more powerful cousins, but it gets my teeth cleaner than a manual toothbrush does</li>
      <li>Its easy to use.</li>
      <li>Not to strong.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much for the value that I bought one as a Christmas gift for a friend.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure.</li>
      <li>The original toothbrush lasted almost a year and it came with 2 replacement brushes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i originally got the t-brush as part of a waterpik sink-top set.  </li>
      <li>Perfect size for my mouth&#x27;s hard to reach places while feeling comfortable in the hand.  </li>
      <li>It does massage the gums and keep the teeth clean</li>
      <li>My teeth have never felt so clean.  </li>
      <li>Surprised and thrilled.  </li>
      <li>and it is has nice soft brush.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a deep clean, but the vibrating part seems effective.</li>
      <li>The vibration isn&#x27;t as strong as larger electronic brush, but as mentioned its adequate and still better than manual brushing.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is definitely worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth $10.</li>
      <li>I liked it&#x27;s compact size as it fit in ordinary toothbrush holder for traveling and was powerful enough to do a good job.</li>
      <li>The price was right.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very soft and well shaped and It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Serves me right big name isn&#x27;t always better</li>
      <li>stars instead of five, because the first one&#x27;s motor (or something) wore out.  </li>
      <li>Overall it is okay.</li>
      <li>And yes, it can be a bit tricky to keep the power on (hold it for more than a second) and get it to turn off</li>
      <li>first week I used it the head fell off and there aren&#x27;t any replacements with it.  </li>
      <li>It also won&#x27;t vibrate your teeth (for sensitive people), splatter tooth paste all around, and sound like a jet engine.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, all right...too gentle.</li>
      <li>When I saw this for $7, I figured I had little to lose trying it and now that I have, I love it!</li>
      <li>The brush has super soft bristles....</li>
      <li>this is a nice little toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Nice little brush.</li>
      <li>there really is something to the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
      <li>Because I have a  problem about opening my mouth, it accommodates it very well and without any pain so that it really is a marvel to me.</li>
      <li>I really needed some oral help and the toothbrush was a bonus.</li>
      <li>It simply vibrates and doesn&#x27;t do anything to sonically clean your teeth.</li>
      <li>Not  the same power as a full size but still works well.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft, but that actually makes brushing your teeth and gums easier as you only need to put gentle, light pressure on your teeth to clean them thoroughly, and the soft bristles won&#x27;t erode your gums/gumline away like firmer brushes can.</li>
      <li>The vibation is gentle and the soft bristles don&#x27;t cause his gums to bleed.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;ll just take the Sonicare and a charger along when I&#x27;m away, if I&#x27;m going to be gone more than a few days.</li>
      <li>Live and Learn.</li>
      <li>I like it better than the higher powered Waterpik sonic toothbrush in a recharger that finally broke at where the replacement heads go in, and at a lot less money!  </li>
      <li>I held back the 5th star only because I&#x27;m not an expert on powered toothbrushes and would not wish to highly recommend something that may not be sufficiently powerful for you.</li>
      <li>The tooth brush&#x27;s bristles are soft, it takes only 1 AAA battery, and its vibration is adequate enough for its size.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s not messy at all like some rotating electronic toothbrushes that can sling water and toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Quit working completely.</li>
      <li>Still searching for a battery operated travel brush at a reasonable price, since my battery Sonicare died, after several years as the travel brush.</li>
      <li>Works about as good as my husband&#x27;s expensive Sonic.</li>
      <li>after about 3 months, the original brush started getting too worn to ignore and the &#x27;power&#x27; slowly became less-reliable--to the point it wouldn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s worth the extra few dollars it costs.</li>
      <li>If you just want to freshen your mouth, I guess it&#x27;s okay, but I could hardly wait to get home to my Sonicare tooth brush after a few days away from it.</li>

<li> A little on the weak side but small and low profile like a real toothbrush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wanted to try an electric toothbrush to see if I liked it. The price was right. I love the Waterpik  brand. It works great.</li>
    <li> A little on the weak side but small and low profile like a real toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I liked it but it didn&#x27;t last but two months.</li>
    <li> I like it better than the higher powered Waterpik sonic toothbrush in a recharger that finally broke at where the replacement heads go in, and at a lot less money!  I do hate the idea of just throwing away something that working fine just because the brush bristles need replacing.  And yes, it can be a bit tricky to keep the power on (hold it for more than a second) and get it to turn off (same, trick is to hold down slightly longer) but I&#x27;ll be buying another one, I&#x27;m pretty sure.</li>
    <li> it is a joke! so little action might as well be off. too expensive to return. Giving to charity</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Advertising deceptive.</li>
    <li> I love Waterpik products and was hoping this would be just as excellent a product as their others, but this is a joke. It simply vibrates and doesn&#x27;t do anything to sonically clean your teeth. I can&#x27;t even believe how disappointing this is.</li>
    <li> this is a nice little toothbrush.  there really is something to the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; stuff.  it&#x27;s not fancy--just an on/off switch and you have to decide how long to brush (no timer, etc).  lol  but seriously, don&#x27;t we all kinda know how long to brush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i originally got the t-brush as part of a waterpik sink-top set.  after about 3 months, the original brush started getting too worn to ignore and the &#x27;power&#x27; slowly became less-reliable--to the point it wouldn&#x27;t work at all.  i was bummed because it was one of the best toothbrushes i&#x27;d ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was doing some recon to find something similar, and was stoked to see this toothbrush on amazon.  i got a couple replacement heads too and it works great.  with hope, this one will last longer--at least until i go through the two replacement heads i got--i&#x27;m figuring they should last about a month each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;four stars instead of five, because the first one&#x27;s motor (or something) wore out.  i&#x27;m bump it up another star if this one lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Bad deal, doesn&#x27;t oscillate and the switch does not stay on.  Not worth a penny much less the money I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing this product&lt;br /&gt;\Shame kon Amazon for vending such a faulty product.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. Not  the same power as a full size but still works well. I bought this unit because the tip on my last one  broke off. I guess I waa pressing it too hard. Using less pressure with this one.</li>
    <li> brush falls off while cleaning teeth</li>
    <li> Great for traveling. Don&#x27;t have to carry around the big toothbrush plus charger.  Not sure how long the batteries will last.  Cleans well.</li>
    <li> Good value and a very good product</li>
    <li> Works about as good as my husband&#x27;s expensive Sonic.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner.  You have to get used to the toothbrush doing all the work and move is small circles but this toothbrush is terrific!! My gums feel so much better!!</li>
    <li> Simple tootbrush, works as expected.</li>
    <li> Great travel toothbrush to take with you anywhere. Its completely small and as compact as a manual toothbrush. I throw it in with my toiletries bag when I travel and it takes no space at all. The tooth brush&#x27;s bristles are soft, it takes only 1 AAA battery, and its vibration is adequate enough for its size. Its slim and sleek compared to most battery operated toothbrush you&#x27;ll find at a brick and mortar store. I also use it as a second brush when I&#x27;m charging my regular electric tooth brush. The vibration isn&#x27;t as strong as larger electronic brush, but as mentioned its adequate and still better than manual brushing. It also won&#x27;t vibrate your teeth (for sensitive people), splatter tooth paste all around, and sound like a jet engine.</li>
    <li> I liked it&#x27;s compact size as it fit in ordinary toothbrush holder for traveling and was powerful enough to do a good job.</li>
    <li> Super Pros: Compact!! Works great and replacement heads very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my mouth&#x27;s hard to reach places while feeling comfortable in the hand.  Love this brush!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is definitely worth the money.  I bought the waterpik toothbrush set almost 2 years ago.  I really needed some oral help and the toothbrush was a bonus. I got it home and fell in love.  The toothbrush is gentle but yet very effective at cleaning your teeth. My teeth have never felt so clean.  Its very gentle on the gums as well!!!  I will never go back to a manual toothbrush.  The original toothbrush lasted almost a year and it came with 2 replacement brushes.  I think this works better than the colgate brushes and are cheaper.</li>
    <li> I got this Nano-Sonic toothbrush as a freebie included with the last Waterpik I bought, and I think it is the best electronic toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. The ultrasonic vibration of the bristles on the teeth and gums scrubs them cleaner than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, electric or manual. It works like the ultrasonic scaler my dental hygienist uses. Also, it&#x27;s not messy at all like some rotating electronic toothbrushes that can sling water and toothpaste. The bristles are soft, but that actually makes brushing your teeth and gums easier as you only need to put gentle, light pressure on your teeth to clean them thoroughly, and the soft bristles won&#x27;t erode your gums/gumline away like firmer brushes can. I will recommend this toothbrush to anyone wanting a thorough scrubbing of their teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Great price. Nice product. I liked it so much for the value that I bought one as a Christmas gift for a friend.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to get comfortable with Philips Sonicare toothbrushes although my dental hygienist recommends them strongly (and keeps trying to sell me one!).  I&#x27;ve found them difficult to use and vibrate my jaw too much. Could be I&#x27;m over-sensitive. When I saw this for $7, I figured I had little to lose trying it and now that I have, I love it! The bristles are very soft and well shaped and It&#x27;s easy to use.  I have no idea whether it&#x27;s as effective as its more powerful cousins, but it gets my teeth cleaner than a manual toothbrush does and that&#x27;s worth the extra few dollars it costs. I held back the 5th star only because I&#x27;m not an expert on powered toothbrushes and would not wish to highly recommend something that may not be sufficiently powerful for you.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s obviously not as powerful as a regular ultrasonic toothbrush that you&#x27;d use at home, this is an inexpensive and practical option if you want the same type of ultrasonic cleaning in a travel brush. When comparing the power level to our home toothbrushes, this one is probably 50-75% of what the regular ones do on the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting. But for travel use, it&#x27;s a nice choice, and certainly better than just carrying a manual brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve had many. It&#x27;s small size and small weight are so easy to hold. Because I have a  problem about opening my mouth, it accommodates it very well and without any pain so that it really is a marvel to me.</li>
    <li> If you just want to freshen your mouth, I guess it&#x27;s okay, but I could hardly wait to get home to my Sonicare tooth brush after a few days away from it. My teeth felt furry after I finished, no matter how long I used this thing. Very gentle, all right...too gentle. Still searching for a battery operated travel brush at a reasonable price, since my battery Sonicare died, after several years as the travel brush. Apparently the seal disintegrated enough to allow water into the battery compartment, but I had used it for at least 4-5 years on trips, so can&#x27;t really complain, it was only @ $18 when I got it. Now the similar one is almost twice that. So, I&#x27;ll just take the Sonicare and a charger along when I&#x27;m away, if I&#x27;m going to be gone more than a few days.</li>
    <li> Noticed after opening that electronic vibration function seemed very weak. Used for 2 days and then replaced battery thinking it was bad. Quit working completely. Now I have an  expensive non-electric toothbrush! Replaced with an Oral B Pulsar from the grocery store for 1/2 the $9.99 I paid thru Amazon Prime. Live and Learn.</li>
    <li> I use this to brush my dog&#x27;s teeth. It works great.  Its easy to use. The vibation is gentle and the soft bristles don&#x27;t cause his gums to bleed.</li>
    <li> The brush has super soft bristles....so I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a deep clean, but the vibrating part seems effective.</li>
    <li> Surprised and thrilled.  Nice little brush. Not to strong. Super easy to use. Definitely worth $10. I&#x27;ll buy one every year.  Uses a triple A battery</li>
    <li> A little too soft for my liking. But a great travel tooth brush. Overall it is okay. It does massage the gums and keep the teeth clean</li>
    <li> Works really good and it is has nice soft brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush thinking I might derive some of the  water pick benefits  I must say that it isn&#x27;t  anywhere as good as the cheaper oral B brush.  I am so sorry that I spent the money for it.&lt;br /&gt;The first week I used it the head fell off and there aren&#x27;t any replacements with it.  Serves me right big name isn&#x27;t always better</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was a complete waste of money! The brush head seems great, at first. It&#x27;s small and can get all sides of those hard to reach back teeth .. try this and you are likely to end up with clipped teeth!!! the brush head doesn&#x27;t move any but the handle vibrates like crazy! Awful! Simply awful :(</li>
    <li> Not a very good product. At least, not what I expected.</li>
