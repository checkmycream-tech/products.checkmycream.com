      <li>Probably good for people with sensitive skin</li>

      <li>It is a really good exfoliate for the entire body.  </li>
      <li>but I love it so much</li>
      <li>I tried this body scrub recently and love it!  </li>

      <li>I would love to see it offered with different fragrance options.</li>
      <li>I am sure I will be using this for a long time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a dead sea salt exfoliation before and it was amazing, but this product wasn&#x27;t even close.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
      <li>very misleading....</li>
      <li>and this is so much easier to spread and soothing to my skin.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product highly!</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
      <li>Only used a few times but like it so far...can&#x27;t see any affect yet, but my legs felt good.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just personal preference, but I like the exfoliation to be more coarse.</li>
      <li>It really cleanses the skin and helps dry up blemishes quickly.</li>
      <li>Definitely goes a long way and keeps my skin silky smooth for days!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy and I love anything Dead Sea Salt</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It turned out that this scrub is barely exfoliating, it does not leave the skin terse, but rather dry, and it does not smell good at all.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, at a price of $23 for 8 ounces this product, that claims to be organic albeit packing tons of synthetic components, it is 8 times more expensive than the $7, 20 ounces</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m particularly rough on my feet and the scrub has worked wonders on them; leaving them feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and overall pretty picky about what products I use.</li>
      <li>My skin felt moisturized and so soft after two uses.</li>
      <li>tanning~ and this body scrub really does make my skin look silky, softer and younger!</li>
      <li>truly natural Trader Joe&#x27;s Salt Scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
      <li>It smells heavenly and made my skin feel so soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and was worried it may cause irritation.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel soft.</li>
      <li>Many body scrubs are either too thick or too watery.</li>
      <li>It also helped to smooth my rough dry feet.</li>
      <li>It made my skin super silky, and helped clear up a ton of black heads I had!</li>
      <li>It actually has helped eliminate redness on my arms completely, something I never thought would go away was handled after using the scrub just 2x.</li>
      <li>The combination of these two products is the only thing that has actually worked to clear up his skin.  </li>
      <li>It is classified as a high human health priority and expected to be toxic or harmful.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This scrub works well enough. It&#x27;s creamy and I love anything Dead Sea Salt but it kind of stinks (smells bad). Scent is very important to me so I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> You cannot state that your product is PURE and ORGANIC when there are chemically derived ingredients like DLS and Tetrasodium EDTA !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tetrasodium EDTA a low to moderate hazard ingredient, depending on its usage. It notes concerns regarding cancer, enhanced skin absorption, organ system toxicity and irritation (due to animal studies that showed skin irritation at low doses). It is classified as a high human health priority and expected to be toxic or harmful.&lt;br /&gt;It is an ecotoxin, and widespread use of EDTA and its slow removal under many environmental conditions has led to its status as the most abundant anthropogenic compound in many surface waters.</li>
    <li> I love this body scrub! It works the best for my sun and beach battered skin. I love the smell too!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes your skin feel so smooth and silky and smells so good.Smooths on like a silky cream and when you wash it off your skin feels silky and moisturized.I am addicted and will purchase this again.I have tried others and i stop using them cause they make me itchy not this.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this salt scrub.  Smooth, creamy and leaves my skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Delv&#x27;d on time...packaged well. Only used a few times but like it so far...can&#x27;t see any affect yet, but my legs felt good.  I can only compare this to what is used when I get a pedicure when someone else is massaging my legs (they do a better job!), but I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this body scrub for awhile and I can honestly say that my skin feels softer than it ever has. I&amp;#34;m hard on my skin by being in the sun a lot, getting sunburns, and tanning~ and this body scrub really does make my skin look silky, softer and younger! I would recommend this to any of my friends that want smoother, softer skin :)</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t worth over $20.  It&#x27;s not any different or better than some I&#x27;ve bought at the grocery or drug store (except in price).</li>
    <li> I love this body scrub! It has a clean, herbal scent and a very creamy texture. The Dead Sea salts provide gentle exfoliation without being harsh like other salt scrubs. It leaves my skin soft and smooth. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> The product was given to me as a gift and I have used it a few times now. By far this is the BEST scrub I have used. Not only does it smell good but also keeps my skin smooth for days! My boyfriend figured out this was the secret to my soft skin and wants to buy me a lifetime supply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been to the Dead Sea and used/purchased Dead Sea scrubs&#x27; before and this is so much easier to spread and soothing to my skin. I didn&#x27;t have a rash nor did it sting at all!!</li>
    <li> I tried this body scrub recently and love it!  I used it on my elbows to reduce the worn skin that&#x27;s noticeable there, and it worked great!  It reduced the amount of visible, wrinkled dry skin!  I even used it on my forearms, calves and feet and they all felt wonderfully moist and smooth afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for a few months now and I just love it! My skin is so soft and it&#x27;s very gentle. It actually has helped eliminate redness on my arms completely, something I never thought would go away was handled after using the scrub just 2x. It&#x27;s well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  I have extremely sensitive skin and was worried it may cause irritation.  Quite the opposite!!  The scrub isn&#x27;t too harsh and leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.  It also has a wonderful scent that is heavenly and isn&#x27;t overpowering in the slightest.  I&#x27;m particularly rough on my feet and the scrub has worked wonders on them; leaving them feeling smooth and soft.  The seller was quite helpful with any questions I had during the purchasing process and I received my order in a timely manner.  I recommend this product highly!</li>
    <li> Very effective and not too abrasive it was perfect.</li>
    <li> not sure what the hype is, but this product is not that great.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just personal preference, but I like the exfoliation to be more coarse. I didn&#x27;t really notice any exfoliation because the salt was too fine..  Probably good for people with sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use it on my face, it just wont work as an exfoliation anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a dead sea salt exfoliation before and it was amazing, but this product wasn&#x27;t even close. Keep shopping around.</li>
    <li> This scrub is amazing. My favorite thing about it is how easily it spreads. Many body scrubs are either too thick or too watery. This one spreads with ease and also remains on my skin. My skin felt moisturized and so soft after two uses. This product is the treat my skin deserves. I would love to see it offered with different fragrance options.</li>
    <li> i have been using this scrub for years and swera by it. it is yummy.&lt;br /&gt;definately give it a try&lt;br /&gt;mmfunstuff</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Got it at a discount, but I would buy it full price any time! It made my skin super silky, and helped clear up a ton of black heads I had! Great stuff! My girlfriend loves the scent of it too!</li>
    <li> I needed an exfoliating scrub that would remove dead, ashy skin in the humid summer and leave my skin soft and moisturized. I read the reviews for this, and it has been perfect! It is spreadable, so it can be easily used in the shower. I wanted this for my legs but I love it so much, I use it for my arms and feet too. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  My skin was dry after I used it.  I would not recommend this product to people who have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I loved how it made my skin feel after using it. I am VERY picky about my products and am very happy with this.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is very creamy and a little goes a long way. Your skin feels like a baby when you are done with your shower.</li>
    <li> My wife and I wanted to try this product as an alternative to the one from Trader Joe&#x27;s we have been using for years now and got a little bit tired of its lavender scent.  We did not mind to pay a premium price should the quality of the product justify it.&lt;br /&gt;It turned out that this scrub is barely exfoliating, it does not leave the skin terse, but rather dry, and it does not smell good at all.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, at a price of $23 for 8 ounces this product, that claims to be organic albeit packing tons of synthetic components, it is 8 times more expensive than the $7, 20 ounces truly natural Trader Joe&#x27;s Salt Scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Definitely goes a long way and keeps my skin silky smooth for days!</li>
    <li> Might just be my skin, but even using this product 12 hours after I shaved my legs, it was burning on my skin.  I could only use it twice before I had to throw it out :(</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel soft. It does have a herbal smell</li>
    <li> It really cleanses the skin and helps dry up blemishes quickly. It is a really good exfoliate for the entire body.  I will be buying more</li>

    <li> I have sensitive skin and overall pretty picky about what products I use. I found this scrub to be quite nice!, light and creamy, exfoliates and leaves your skin nice and soft and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love this product!</li>
    <li> how can this be organic when it has  Sodium Cocyl Isethionate, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium EDTA, ?????? not good for you at all!! very misleading....</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this body scrub. It gives your skin a nice smooth clean feeling. It is not greasy and leaves your skin fresh. I also enjoyed the smell and the texture of the product. I highly recommend the product, it lasts for a long time since you only need a small amount. It also helped to smooth my rough dry feet. It would make a great birthday or holiday gift.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! It turns an ordinary shower into a spa experience. WITHOUT the hefty price tag! I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> My son used this for his eczema in along with MetaDeram Organic Eczema Cream.  The combination of these two products is the only thing that has actually worked to clear up his skin.  Fantastic product.</li>
