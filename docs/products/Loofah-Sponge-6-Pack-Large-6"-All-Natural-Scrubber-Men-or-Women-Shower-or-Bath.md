<ol>
      <li>Excellent quality just what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>These Loofahs are great!  </li>
      <li>These are awesome</li>
      <li>But they are great if you like them flattened!</li>
      <li>and the price is very good.</li>
      <li>great to exfoliate</li>
      <li>These come vac sealed which is great for storage.</li>
      <li>The service was great as well.  </li>
      <li>They were each vacuumed sealed great for saving them.</li>
      <li>Great loofah but</li>
      <li>After that it was great.</li>
      <li>These are really good scrubby loofahs.</li>
      <li>so I guess that is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>I liked the attached ropes, but not the size variations.</li>
      <li>My skin is so smooth I can&#x27;t stop touching myself!</li>
      <li>I think they are just spoiled brats, the picture does not show ropes and there ain&#x27;t none on the ones I got, OK if I want rope</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok (comparatively speaking)</li>
      <li>more you use it the faster</li>
      <li>I looked through many listings and bought this one because a reviewer had said that there was a rope.  </li>
      <li>Too many to use.</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>Number in package is good, but in consistent in size and shape.  </li>
      <li>would cost me too much on top of original cost plus postage from the states.</li>
      <li>Not going to be easy to use for what I wanted them at all, if at all.  </li>
      <li>They also came flat and that was also very nice since I knew for sure there was no moisture  </li>
      <li>They are fine</li>
      <li>Does not Sud up like a cheap store</li>
      <li>When they arrived they were a great deal smaller than the picture depicted.</li>
      <li>you first get it take one out and in cool to warm water</li>
      <li>you want to clean it</li>
      <li>Gets you clean.</li>
      <li>Just received the loofahs,They are compressed flat for easy packing, opened one up put warm water on it</li>
      <li>The first thing I did when opening it was to poke a hole and add a loop of cheap nylon rope.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what I wanted, nice for taking care of dry winter skin.</li>
      <li>like how hard they are they work great for my K.P and for my stetch marks on my hips.</li>
      <li>Thank so much!</li>
      <li>It first comes since it is dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>The loofahs arrive and are smashed (purposely) like a pancake which had me worried at first.  </li>
      <li>: They are like sand paper at first.</li>
      <li>story short:  If you only care about scrubbing power then these are just as good as any others.</li>
      <li>If these were not also soft (once I got it wet in the shower), I would say they would be a good buy at $9.</li>
      <li>but I would not call that large.</li>
      <li>And it is described as large</li>
      <li>I will certainly buy from here again.  </li>
      <li>But I quickly found out (something I hadn&#x27;t been able to find info on anywhere) that you can easily round them out again by putting them in water.</li>
      <li>about 4-5 inches about the size of you whole hand or longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>: comes fast.</li>
      <li>These feel like they&#x27;re taking revenge on my skin because my it was responsible for murdering their extended family.</li>
      <li>and I could not find any real loofahs just the nylon ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>each individually wrapped and aside from an occasional seed they are nice</li>
      <li>and it filled right out to full size, which is 6 inches long and 2 1/2 inches across nice texture not to hard not to soft</li>
      <li>Liked the size, but so hard.</li>
      <li>Not like real natural loofahs.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d stand more than a few uses before coming apart.  </li>
      <li>If you love firm scrubbing sponges, then these are for you.  </li>
      <li>The product itself is pretty standard</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find at my local stores.</li>
      <li>Loofahs are pretty simple.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely smooshed flat.</li>
      <li>a little tip it only takes light rubbing when using this to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are long enough to firmly fit my hand without slipping out.</li>
      <li>They came dehydrated and individually packaged, but popped right back into their round shape once we soaked them in water.  </li>

<li> They came dehydrated and individually packaged, but popped right back into their round shape once we soaked them in water.  </li>
<li> These come in a flattened state for ease of shipping and storage, but put them under some water and they they slowly poof right up.</li>
<li> The flat shape makes them smaller to ship and also makes them smaller to store in my closet</li>
<li> , just right, I looked at some of the other reviews and was a little worried as there seemed to be a lot of people whining about how these look and feel after receiving my loofah</li>
<li> Much smaller and flat.</li>
<li> They are individually wrapped and after the first use the loofah returned to its expected round shape.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;ll get rid of the dead skin but also take some live stuff too!</li>
<li> Being new to loofahs, it surprised me how hard these babies are to find, so i bought six.</li>
<li> I soaked it in hot water for 20 min, before use, it expanded, but never softened hardly at all, no give.</li>
<li> They come vacuumed sealed and last very long, especially at this cost.</li>
<li> They do not absord soap and too hard to really use</li>
<li> long, but the thickness is a joke.  </li>
<li> ; long</li>
<li> thy are coarse and rough but not overly.</li>
<li> Just grow a plant, cut it up, and dry it.  </li>
<li> /&gt;There are two issues with this product, each subtracting a single star.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
<li> upon seeing the loofahs for the first time they DO NOT look like the photo - they are flat and are advertised as &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; I have used &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; loofahs in the past - these do not appear &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;  The photo is deceiving to say the least</li>
<li> Durable, too - they last quite a few weeks, each.</li>
<li> Plus even when soaked, they were still rock hard, which other ones I have purchased over the last few years from other places, were not.</li>
<li> Gave away half as gifts.</li>
<li> I guess but harsh as hell...</li>
<li> Not at all round, as pictured.</li>
<li> They came within  a few days.</li>
<li> I thought they were going to be in their round shape when i received them.  </li>
<li> Hard and rough like send paper!</li>
<li> All they had was the fabric mesh things that I think are useless in scrubbing off dry skin.</li>
<li> These remain very stiff and hard, even after soaking.  </li>
<li> I soaked them before use and they are still too hard to use.</li>
<li> All six loofahs are bleached to that ubiquitous khaki color which was just disappointing enough to lose a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Not nearly as nice as pictured.</li>
<li> But considering their size, and that they do not provide exfoliation like they should, this was not a good purchase.</li>
<li> Very sad that these were squished in half when sealed in their plastic wrap!  </li>
<li> There were a few seeds in each one that I&#x27;m still having a hard time removing, but that&#x27;s the worst I can say, so they&#x27;re working just like I needed.</li>
<li> The loofah was very thin.  </li>
<li> Very thin, they may be 6&amp;#34;</li>
<li> I am very disappointed and will be unable to use them which makes it a waste of money.</li>
<li> I will use them for something though as I already opened them :(  </li>
<li> so unless someone can clue me in I am saying they are worthless.</li>

    <li> These remain very stiff and hard, even after soaking.  Not like real natural loofahs.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I wanted, nice for taking care of dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> Too many to use. Gave away half as gifts. ( unused ones) each individually wrapped and aside from an occasional seed they are nice</li>
    <li> Seems like a lot of money to have paid for Loofahs but the price compares favorably with what I have found elsewhere.  The loofahs arrive and are smashed (purposely) like a pancake which had me worried at first.  They are individually wrapped and after the first use the loofah returned to its expected round shape.  The flat shape makes them smaller to ship and also makes them smaller to store in my closet so I guess that is a good thing.  No issues, they work just like a loofah should and have lasted for several months.</li>
    <li> Very sad that these were squished in half when sealed in their plastic wrap!  I thought they were going to be in their round shape when i received them.  Not going to be easy to use for what I wanted them at all, if at all.  I will use them for something though as I already opened them :(  But they are great if you like them flattened!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find at my local stores. All they had was the fabric mesh things that I think are useless in scrubbing off dry skin.</li>
    <li> Hard and rough like send paper! I sent it back!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok (comparatively speaking) but you can improve on the uniformity of the sizes please.  And it is described as large but it comes with a mix of smaller ones.</li>
    <li> These are awesome I will certainly buy from here again.  Excellent quality just what I was looking for.  The service was great as well.  Thank so much!</li>
    <li> Very thin, they may be 6&amp;#34; long, but the thickness is a joke.  Don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d stand more than a few uses before coming apart.  Returned.</li>
    <li> I had to have these sent from the USA as you don&#x27;t ship to Tenerife, Canary Islands. When they arrived they were a great deal smaller than the picture depicted. Plus even when soaked, they were still rock hard, which other ones I have purchased over the last few years from other places, were not. I am very disappointed and will be unable to use them which makes it a waste of money. I am a pensioner &amp; to ship them back would cost me too much on top of original cost plus postage from the states.</li>
    <li> Absolutely smooshed flat. Not at all round, as pictured. Packaging was *not* the cause, either. The box was well cushioned.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as nice as pictured. Much smaller and flat.</li>
    <li> They are fine I guess but harsh as hell... it&#x27;ll get rid of the dead skin but also take some live stuff too!</li>
    <li> Loofahs are pretty simple.  Just grow a plant, cut it up, and dry it.  The product itself is pretty standard so I have no complaints about it&#x27;s scrubbiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two issues with this product, each subtracting a single star.&lt;br /&gt;1. There was no rope on these loofahs.  I looked through many listings and bought this one because a reviewer had said that there was a rope.  I&#x27;m not calling them a liar, since it probably depends on the supplier.  A rope is a big deal to me since I hang mine in the shower when I&#x27;m done with it.  The first thing I did when opening it was to poke a hole and add a loop of cheap nylon rope.&lt;br /&gt;2. The product I received was bleached.  The image in the listing is unbleached which was another selling point for me since it doesn&#x27;t enhance the scrubbiness and I don&#x27;t care what it looks like - may as well use the product with a smaller environmental impact.  All six loofahs are bleached to that ubiquitous khaki color which was just disappointing enough to lose a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short:  If you only care about scrubbing power then these are just as good as any others. If you want ropes or are concerned about the environment then choose a different item.</li>
    <li> Great loofah but sizes are not uniform.</li>
    <li> We used these for making soap, embedding them into the bars for exfoliation.  They came dehydrated and individually packaged, but popped right back into their round shape once we soaked them in water.  They are a bit inconsistently sized, but that is to be expected from a natural product.</li>
    <li> The grow mold almost immediately.</li>
    <li> These feel like they&#x27;re taking revenge on my skin because my it was responsible for murdering their extended family.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for sponges that were still round-shaped and thought I had found them in this. I was wrong - they came flattened like so many others. But I quickly found out (something I hadn&#x27;t been able to find info on anywhere) that you can easily round them out again by putting them in water. After that it was great. There were a few seeds in each one that I&#x27;m still having a hard time removing, but that&#x27;s the worst I can say, so they&#x27;re working just like I needed.</li>
    <li> These are really good scrubby loofahs. Durable, too - they last quite a few weeks, each. I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll have to re-order them - but I will, when I need to.</li>
    <li> Being new to loofahs, it surprised me how hard these babies are to find, so i bought six. These come in a flattened state for ease of shipping and storage, but put them under some water and they they slowly poof right up. My skin is so smooth I can&#x27;t stop touching myself!</li>
    <li> So yes, they are actually 6&amp;#34; long but I would not call that large. I was deceived by the word &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; and the photo of the loofahs is misleading. See photos of what I received. If these were not also soft (once I got it wet in the shower), I would say they would be a good buy at $9. But considering their size, and that they do not provide exfoliation like they should, this was not a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Someone tell me how to use these things.  I soaked them before use and they are still too hard to use. They do not absord soap and too hard to really use so unless someone can clue me in I am saying they are worthless.</li>
    <li> Should have read reviews. Liked the size, but so hard. I soaked it in hot water for 20 min, before use, it expanded, but never softened hardly at all, no give.</li>
    <li> Gets you clean. great to exfoliate</li>
    <li> Number in package is good, but in consistent in size and shape.  Also found lots of seeds which I had to dig out.  I liked the attached ropes, but not the size variations.</li>
    <li> Just received the loofahs,They are compressed flat for easy packing, opened one up put warm water on it and it filled right out to full size, which is 6 inches long and 2 1/2 inches across nice texture not to hard not to soft, just right, I looked at some of the other reviews and was a little worried as there seemed to be a lot of people whining about how these look and feel after receiving my loofah I think they are just spoiled brats, the picture does not show ropes and there ain&#x27;t none on the ones I got, OK if I want rope I can put that on my self ( oh the pain) they are all the same length but not the same size across ( damm mother nature, It&#x27;s a plant, Duhh) there 6 of them and if they fall apart from washing your body you must have scales or something, I know I won&#x27;t run out of them any time soon. and the price is very good.</li>
    <li> These Loofahs are great!  They come vacuumed sealed and last very long, especially at this cost.</li>
    <li> Product arrive within the allotted time. Very coarse!!</li>
    <li> These come vac sealed which is great for storage. thy are coarse and rough but not overly.</li>
    <li> I love these. I looked everywhere in town and I could not find any real loofahs just the nylon ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend ordered them for my from/shipped by amazon. They came within  a few days. They were each vacuumed sealed great for saving them. They also came flat and that was also very nice since I knew for sure there was no moisture  in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: comes fast. about 4-5 inches about the size of you whole hand or longer.&lt;br /&gt;I like how hard they are they work great for my K.P and for my stetch marks on my hips. Softens skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They are like sand paper at first. Does not Sud up like a cheap store loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caring for your loofah:&lt;br /&gt;When you first get it take one out and in cool to warm water let it soak all day or over night. This will help with the flatness of it when. It first comes since it is dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;When you are done using it squeeze out the water and hang it or set it in the shower caddy to drain or else it will mold.&lt;br /&gt;The more you use it the faster it will soften.&lt;br /&gt;When you want to clean it just look up how on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;Also a little tip it only takes light rubbing when using this to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped everyone</li>
    <li> The loofah was very thin.  I was expecting a thicker sponge.</li>
    <li> Just received them yesterday...upon seeing the loofahs for the first time they DO NOT look like the photo - they are flat and are advertised as &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; I have used &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; loofahs in the past - these do not appear &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;  The photo is deceiving to say the least</li>
    <li> If you love firm scrubbing sponges, then these are for you.  They are long enough to firmly fit my hand without slipping out.</li>
