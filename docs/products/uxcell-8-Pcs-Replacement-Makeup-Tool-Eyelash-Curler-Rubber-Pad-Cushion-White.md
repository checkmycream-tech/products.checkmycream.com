      <li>They fit perfectly and are nice and firm</li>
      <li>When I need more I hope they are still available.</li>
      <li>I am so happy that they fit, and I don&#x27;t have to buy a new curler every time my pads wear out.  </li>
      <li>and it fits fine</li>
      <li>These pads are just fine</li>
      <li>The product is fine.  </li>
      <li>With a little trimming they work perfectly.</li>
      <li>and I had to jam it in to get it to fit, which it still didn&#x27;t do so well.</li>
      <li>They do fit in my newer eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t fit in my curling scissors</li>
      <li>Overall a great product and unbeatable price.</li>
      <li>They perfectly fit my Up&amp;Up brand curler.  </li>
      <li>they were so cheap.</li>
      <li>These ARE rubber, but they are not cut to fit in my 35</li>
      <li>These didnt fit in any eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>and I had to cut just a tip of it to fit my curler</li>
      <li>Filled the bill for three of my four eyelash curler replacements; but did it have to come from Hong Kong?</li>
      <li>The pads don&#x27;t exactly fit but I can cut them to work.  </li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t really fit my eyelash curler, so I took scissors and carved them where needed to fit.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t fit in revlon products like it said.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit Covergirl eyecurler as claimed</li>
      <li>Based on one review, i thought this would fit my Maybelline (print letters)</li>
      <li>However these don&#x27;t fit in my maybelline eye lash curler.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time at a fantastic price.  </li>
      <li>well so far its good.</li>
      <li>they do not fit my Maybelline, but they do fit my Tweezerman perfectly.</li>
      <li>They work okay, but not as good as Revlon or Maybelline white ones did.  </li>
      <li>But I am glad to have been able to deal with an understanding company who was kind enough to resolve this quickly and painlessly.</li>
      <li>I fits on most standard eyelash curler and it was amazing.</li>
      <li>Glad they aren&#x27;t to much money.</li>
      <li>Brilliant, like having new curlers, spares means curlers will last for years.</li>
      <li>The reviews are right they won&#x27;t fit Maybelline or Revlon curlers</li>
      <li>Easily installed after that and it stays PUT and really curls the lashes!</li>
      <li>A trick I learned it to super glue the pad into the eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>and they came quickly.</li>
      <li>These are pretty fat, but will probably fit into any curler.</li>
      <li>length is correct, wish that I could find something thick wise that would fit most USA made eyelash curlers, versus this China made brand.</li>
      <li>I thing is better if you buy a new eyelashes curler than this typed of rubber pads replacement.</li>
      <li>These are a great value, and I think it&#x27;s rather wasteful to have to buy a whole new curler just to get a new pad.</li>
      <li>The few times the product was great.</li>
      <li>prefer the old rubber ones so much more</li>
      <li>I did not think it was worth the time to return them, so I kept them in case</li>
      <li>Still waiting on them but it will be worth it once on its arrival.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>Instead for throwing away my eyelash curler, I was able to use the rubber cushions to replace the old ones.</li>
      <li>They are gentle but give a nice curl based on your techniqe, similar to the original &amp;#34;Trim&amp;#34; inserts.</li>
      <li>They wouldn&#x27;t fit in my particular eyelash curler device.</li>
      <li>After not being able to find refills in my local stores, I ordered these.</li>
      <li>They really work!</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t fit into my old Maybelline eyelash curlers.  </li>
      <li>I do have on old Lacross eyelash curler that they will fit</li>
      <li>3 weeks into using my first one, so we&#x27;ll see how they hold up over time.  </li>
      <li>Too SHORT for most eyelash curlers.  </li>
      <li>Although these are a bit big for my Cover Girl eyelash curler, I am able to make them work by pressing them into the receptacle.</li>
      <li>My Curler works so much better now, and I have enough for a lifetime.  </li>
      <li>Since Cover Girl doesn&#x27;t make eyelash curler replacement pads, I&#x27;m glad I finally found something that works.</li>
      <li>These fit my old Sally Hansen eye lash curler.</li>
      <li>broke first time i used it.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>They are too soft and the shape didn&#x27;t fit my Maybelline curler.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit the standard Revlon curler which is the reason I bought the item in the first place.</li>
      <li>Too large for Maybelline Eyelash Curler.  </li>
      <li>They also have a rounded top, not flat like the old ones too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> so these eyelash curler replacements are a bit small for my eyelash curler. not too small but I still use them. they are good. well so far its good. guess I should have bought a rosallini eyelash curler along with these but have so many I opted not to.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t fit my cover girl eyelash curler- very disappointing and not worth the hassle or money to return... What a waste....</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, they&#x27;re silicone, not rubber. They&#x27;re useless, as they keep falling out my eyelash curlers.</li>
    <li> Stink! these do not fit my eye lash curler, what a waste.</li>
    <li> Instead for throwing away my eyelash curler, I was able to use the rubber cushions to replace the old ones.</li>
    <li> I would have given 0 stars if it was an option.  They do not fit the standard  USA eyelash curler at all.  Useless.  I threw them in the garbage.  Do not order this product.  Someone from that company should invest in an eyelash curler to test their products on.</li>
    <li> they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, although they are somewhat smaller than the eyelash curler</li>
    <li> The seller claims these will fit an old Maybelline, but they are the same as all the pads for the current eyelash curlers. They have a wide base that will not fit in the older curlers. They also have a rounded top, not flat like the old ones too. Very hard rubber, which is fine if they would have fit. Disappointed in the discription they wrote.</li>
    <li> Too big for regular size curlers. If you order make you have a bigger curler.</li>
    <li> I purchased these refills for my Revlon eyelash curler. They are too small and they are hard rubber, not soft rubber as ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. They came as 1 full package of six and 1 partial, cut up package of 2 to make the eight. The package is from an Asian country with only Asian writing on it. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t fit regular eyelash curlers... save your money</li>
    <li> replacement pads are small and don&#x27;t fit securely in my curler.</li>
    <li> I fits on most standard eyelash curler and it was amazing. I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of refills since ther are 8 of them and it was such a great deal!</li>
    <li> not sure what they are, but they don&#x27;t fit at all.  Too wide and too short.  The funniest part is the instructions in English - I assume the other language written on the packaging is Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refill Rubber&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION:&lt;br /&gt;1.  After installing, check the rubber mat to clip with the eyelash whether equilibrium.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Advert clean and dry of latex before using it.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Don&#x27;t let the kid use it by himself.</li>
    <li> Good quality for price and they came quickly. The only thing is they weren&#x27;t the perfect size for my eyelash curler but they still work.</li>
    <li> They did not work with the Maybelline eyelash curler I bought at the same time. But they did work with the Sally Hansen Eyelash Curler I already had.  Would recommend these refills.</li>
    <li> does not fit my revlon eye lash curler . way to fat and took a long time to come .</li>
    <li> These are a terrible imitation!</li>
    <li> These are horrible and do not fit properly even with cutting them it&#x27;s still not good</li>
    <li> The reviews are right they won&#x27;t fit Maybelline or Revlon curlers but I bought one at a local Dollar General store and it was wide enough for the rubber to fit in. Try your local dollar stores for a wider curler. I didn&#x27;t have to but you may have to trim a little off the ends. They really work!</li>
    <li> For some reason this pad does not have the same effect as the green pads and does not curl my lashes</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with these, they are only worth two or three uses before you need to replace them again</li>
    <li> Still waiting on them but it will be worth it once on its arrival.&lt;br /&gt;Great price I saw for them.</li>
    <li> I have been looking around at different store where I usually bought these Eyelash Curler Rubber Pad replacements and I could&#x27;t find them anywhere.  I came to Amazon and there they were.  Wow, great quality.  My Curler works so much better now, and I have enough for a lifetime.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> These did not meet my expectations.  They were too wide and too short in length.&lt;br /&gt;I had to trim them to make them fit, and after a few uses they rubber became sticky&lt;br /&gt;and pulled out my eyelashes.  Cheap foreign cr-p.  Threw the other 7 away.</li>
    <li> What can I tell you? They perform sufficiently. I needed replacement pads, so I searched on Amazon.com and found them.</li>
    <li> Did not fit the eyelash curlers I have. Too flimsy and not good quality.</li>
    <li> These did not fit my eyelash curler and weren&#x27;t worth returning because 1. they came in a little plastic baggie and 2. they were so cheap. The problem is that these replacement pads are almost impossible to find these days. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> These are a great value, and I think it&#x27;s rather wasteful to have to buy a whole new curler just to get a new pad. The only issue I have with these is that they are a little too long for my curler, but that might just be my curler. With a little trimming they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this a year ago and loved them. So I decided to buy it again and the new set is slightly longer and fatter.</li>
    <li> They are too soft and the shape didn&#x27;t fit my Maybelline curler.  I trimmed and forced one into the curler but it was too soft to work, anyway.  I made the mistake of buying more than one package.  Threw them all away!</li>
    <li> Not as advertised !!! These replacement pads are clearly not the rubber ones but simply the same silicone pads that Maybelline is selling in the new curlers. They are white but are not rubber as advertised. I cannot even get them into my Maybelline curler so I&#x27;ll have to just toss them.</li>
    <li> Too large for Maybelline Eyelash Curler.  Does not fit in groove, even though the product was advertised as fitting the curler.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with these replacement pads.  They were not rubber as stated and were way too small.  They wouldn&#x27;t stay in the eyelash curler and I broke my eyelashes in the process.  First time I was ever disappointed with a purchase on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit Covergirl eyecurler as claimed</li>
    <li> These pads are about 2 - 3 mm (around 1/8 inch) too short on each side for my Maybelline curler and a little too thick. The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because they do not fit exactly. I am so disgusted with Maybelline and their horrid new black pads which do not work a lick, so I was determined to find something better. These pads are just fine once I snipped off a few millimeters at the bottom of the pad because of the thickness. I could NOT get them in any other way. It worked and I am not only pleased, but proud of myself for being so patient and inventive. My supply of these pads will outlive me now! If you buy them, be aware they are a little short and thick. Take a small scissor (like cuticle scissors or nose hair scissors) and cut very carefully a very small amount from the bottom to reduce the thickness. Don&#x27;t worry about them being too short....not enough to make any difference. Easily installed after that and it stays PUT and really curls the lashes!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a little longer than they should be but I cut them and they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have an older eyelash curler by La Cross and these did not fit.  I have tried the newer curlers but they do not fit my eye.  They are too big for my face.  Sure wish they would bring the old Mabelline curler refills back.  They were white rubber with a grooved bottom that fit into the curler.</li>
    <li> These ARE rubber, but they are not cut to fit in my 35+ y o Maybelline eyelash curler.  I have a small scrunchy tied around the handles to keep the rubber from falling out.  I was lead to believe they were MADE for the Maybelline eyelash curler......NOT</li>
    <li> These are absolutely perfect! They are very stiff and I&#x27;ve been using the same pair for a while, my curler just can&#x27;t slice through them! I love it! These are worth every penny and they&#x27;ll last me a while.</li>
    <li> Too small for my eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> The product I received did not have the brand name I ordered (Rosallini) on the packaging; instead it was all in Chinese, and it was shipped from China. I was very disappointed in the product, also, as the rubber replacement pads were thin and wore out quickly.</li>
    <li> This eyelash pad worked great with my old Maybelline eye lash curler.  I have had my curler since the early eighties and was very disappointed when I could not find replacement pads.  I even ended up buying a new curler, but it did not work like my old one (It pinched or crimped my lashes instead of curling them). I was happy to find these pads.  They fit perfectly and are nice and firm so they work well at curling the lashes and not pinching them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  These are not the same as when I ordered them the first time.  They have changed and do not fit my curler anymore.  Way too big.  I am not happy that they are not the same product.  Not sure what eyelash curlier these will fit, but they do not fit my old Maybeline curler</li>
    <li> These are, by far, the WORST replacement pads I&#x27;ve ever used. I tried to put one in my eyelash curler and I had to jam it in to get it to fit, which it still didn&#x27;t do so well. It was gummy, stuck to my lashes, and had little resistance, making it virtually useless. I&#x27;d have given it zero stars if I could have. I&#x27;m going to attempt a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Did not fit my eyelash curler. A total bust!</li>
    <li> Was not what I wanted. Does not fit the maybelline or covergirl curlers.</li>
    <li> These are ok....they do not fit my Maybelline, but they do fit my Tweezerman perfectly. I guess the old white rubber ones are just not around anymore.  Price cannot be beat....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed.  I can&#x27;t stand not being able to use my lash curlers because the replacement rubber was shot, they save the environment from another piece of trash.</li>
    <li> These are still the silicone rubber as you can find everywhere, not the old style rubber pads that used to come in the Maybelline curlers.  Also, there had Chinese writing on them, not the Rosallini branding and they are small and too short for curlers, as others have said.</li>
    <li> Said they were for a Maybelline eyelash curler. Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> These are too small to even fit in my eyelash curler. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time waiting on these to come from China.</li>
    <li> The few times the product was great. They were a bit long and I had to cut just a tip of it to fit my curler and I had no problem doing that and they lasted longer. This recent purchase the product is thinner and fits perfectly in my curler. but they do not last as long and fall out of the curler. I do not like it but it does the job. The ones before were better..</li>
    <li> The quality was very poor. Used only a couple of times and the pad split. Tried a second one and the same thing happened. I threw the rest away.</li>
    <li> They are good. They fit my nyc curler perfectly. The price for them is great and this product is worth getting if you need it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit properly for Revlon or Maybelline eyelash curler. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> These do not fit my eyelash curler at all.[[ASIN:B007ML0DGQ 8 Pcs Replacement Eyelash Curler Rubber Pad Cushion White]]</li>
    <li> These are rubber and much better than those awful silicone ones&lt;br /&gt;That seem to now come with all the eyelash curlers that are now&lt;br /&gt;On the market. Been using 3 months and still good.</li>
    <li> pads are not thick enough so when I squeeze my curler, it doesn&#x27;t do anything. I guess you get what you pay for with this item.</li>
    <li> They do not fit the eyelash curler, they said they would fit.</li>
    <li> Ridiculous product. After waiting nearly 3 weeks for the arrival, I had to go in person to my post office to sign for the package for some reason. That was annoying.  Unfortunately, the product is not as described, and does not fit my Cover Girl curler at all. They are too short and too wide. It&#x27;s frustrating to buy the product that comes up first in a search for &amp;#34;Cover Girl eyelash curler replacement pad&amp;#34; and find that it won&#x27;t work at all. A complete waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> The pads don&#x27;t exactly fit but I can cut them to work.  Was glad to find them.</li>
    <li> These are pretty fat, but will probably fit into any curler. After not being able to find refills in my local stores, I ordered these. A trick I learned it to super glue the pad into the eyelash curler. By the time you need a new one, it is not difficult to pull it back out. The only downside to these is that they came from China...by boat I believe. Don&#x27;t order if you need them in any kind of a hurry.</li>
    <li> My eyelash curler was bought years ago so the replacements do not fit. The new curlers that are being made are two big and will not fit my eye. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> I just got them a few days ago so I don&#x27;t know how long they will last.  But I do like them better than any of the black ones.  They are a little softer and do compare a little closer the old standard Maybelline ones. I would buy these again. They do fit in my newer eyelash curler.  I really can&#x27;t stand those hard black things.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. The replacements do not fit my curler. A bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> perfect size works great. ive used it for my nyc curler and a no brand one as well and it fits fine</li>
    <li> These replacement inserts are so hard to find. I have an old, standard-size Revlon eyelash curler and can no longer find replacement inserts at the drug store. Was hoping these would do the trick. Nope. Too short and too wide. The material they are made of is good, but they just didn&#x27;t fit my eyelash curler so I returned the item to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am giving 4 stars to the company who shipped this item, not the item itself. This item is shipped from Hong Kong and took a while to get to me. When I tried the refills on three of my eyelash curlers (I have multiples because refills seem to be hard to find), nothing fit. The package contains refills that are either too large or too small, and don&#x27;t have the little lip that secures them into the curler slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the company was gracious enough to refund me the entire amount and not require me to mail the item back. The refills are not made for any American style eyelash curlers that I have, and I&#x27;ll have to toss them. But I am glad to have been able to deal with an understanding company who was kind enough to resolve this quickly and painlessly.</li>
    <li> Brilliant, like having new curlers, spares means curlers will last for years. Service was excellant, especially since it was such a small order. They even sent a voucher for discount off next order.</li>
    <li> broke first time i used it. Complete waist</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and couldn&#x27;t find from others.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> The quality of the item is good but it didn&#x27;t fit in my curling scissors they were a little too thick :(</li>
    <li> These come from Asia, so the size is smaller than US curler replacements.  Had I realized that, I would not have ordered them.</li>
    <li> It was advertised as fitting Maybelline eyelash curler - they DO NOT!  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> These do not  fit the eyelash curler. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The replacements do not fit in my eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> Since Cover Girl doesn&#x27;t make eyelash curler replacement pads, I&#x27;m glad I finally found something that works. Although these are a bit big for my Cover Girl eyelash curler, I am able to make them work by pressing them into the receptacle. They will stay in place while curling lashes. I put a small rubber band around the handle of the curler when not in use. Eventually, the pad stays in place.</li>
    <li> My issue wasn&#x27;t about the length of the replacements. There were 8 pieces and 4 of them were dirty. I discarded them. Do not buy them...!</li>
    <li> Service was timely.  However these don&#x27;t fit in my maybelline eye lash curler.</li>
    <li> the refills did not fit my Revlon  curler</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the new hard plastic. prefer the old rubber ones so much more</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought. They wouldn&#x27;t fit in my particular eyelash curler device.</li>
    <li> I received 2 orders I only ordered 1 that would not be too bad but both orders did not fit I went to the maybelline site to be sure I would get the refills for the eyelash curler .I haven&#x27;t found any refills for the replacement rubber refills,2 of my friends can&#x27;t either we are going to throw away the curlers and buy another brand.i would not waste the time and energy for this useless item</li>
    <li> Same problem others had.  They did not fit any of my 3 curlers.  I did not think it was worth the time to return them, so I kept them in case I could use them in the future.  Ended up buying a new curler with replacement made for it.</li>
    <li> For the price it is worth it, some of them are the right size others are smaller than the curler.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money - do not fit Cover Girl Eyelash curler as advertised.  Too short and too narrow - very cheaply made.  I got what I paid for.  :-(</li>
    <li> Tiny curler pads.  Too SHORT for most eyelash curlers.  What a rip off!  You would have to have unusually small eyes and and a small eyelash curler to use these pads.</li>
    <li> I got this product and it didn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s too small, too thing for my eye lashes curler.. this is a waste of money.. I thing is better if you buy a new eyelashes curler than this typed of rubber pads replacement.</li>
    <li> No stars! What a waste of money, does not even fit my Revlon or Maybelline curler. Not even worth sending back.</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS item, it is not a replacement eyelash curler pad!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are great.  They perfectly fit my Up&amp;Up brand curler.  They curl well, too.  3 weeks into using my first one, so we&#x27;ll see how they hold up over time.  I am so happy that they fit, and I don&#x27;t have to buy a new curler every time my pads wear out.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Filled the bill for three of my four eyelash curler replacements; but did it have to come from Hong Kong?</li>
    <li> The product is fine.  I am just wondering why it took so long to arrive.  It arrived in the time that I was told it would, but I could not understand why it had to take so long.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t fit into my old Maybelline eyelash curlers.  They&#x27;re too thick &amp; shorter in length.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time at a fantastic price.  I&#x27;ve looked for these in stores and could not find any so I was very pleased to get them.</li>
    <li> Was ordering for a maybelline eye lash curler but it was not specified once received....have not tried them yet.</li>
    <li> Based on one review, i thought this would fit my Maybelline (print letters) circa 1970&#x27;s curler but it does not.  It does fit the maybelline curler with cursive letters and made in China on the handle.  Also purchased the white ones and they fit revlon curler made in korea.  I will post same review for the white ones.  So the search continues for my older curler.  I have found the new black maybelline pads do work in this curler, just prefer the old soft white ones.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money... They are not white, they are red and yellow, they do not fit Maybelline eyelash curler, they are too fat for the track and too short!!  Maybelline please bring back the white rubber ones that actually fit the curler.  Horrible, Going into the trash.  Wish I could get my money back!</li>
    <li> These do NOT fit the Maybelline eyelash curlers.  They are way to big.  I do have on old Lacross eyelash curler that they will fit in.&lt;br /&gt;These come from Hong Kong and take about 3 weeks or better to get them.</li>
    <li> These do not fit the Maybelline brand curler I bought them for.  I&#x27;ve tossed them in the trash and the purchase price was wasted.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t really fit my eyelash curler, so I took scissors and carved them where needed to fit.  They work okay, but not as good as Revlon or Maybelline white ones did.  Took a long time for them to arrive, but they were so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I searched for refills for a Maybelline lash curler and these don&#x27;t fit!</li>
    <li> I purchased these to use with a $2 drugstore &amp;#34;Trim&amp;#34; eyelash curler. They fit slightly loose and last about  1-2 weeks with daily use. BUT, they can also be used on the back side, also for about a week. They are gentle but give a nice curl based on your techniqe, similar to the original &amp;#34;Trim&amp;#34; inserts. These are nonstick so I have never had them yank out a lash, even when I touch up over mascara later in the day. Overall a great product and unbeatable price. Even though they shipped from overseas I had them within a week of ordering. I will try them with the same brand curler and update.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t fit in revlon products like it said.  They are way to fat. Glad they aren&#x27;t to much money.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit the standard Revlon curler which is the reason I bought the item in the first place. Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews that said these fit old Maybelline eyelash curlers. When I got them, they did not fit mine.  I had to just throw them away.</li>
    <li> I can never find replacement eyelash curler pads where I live. I was very excited to see these on amazon. They work okay but are smaller than my curler which makes them not very good.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to arrive and theyre kind of terrible. They work ok for about a week and then theyre just completely trashed, cut by the curler and wont stay in the curler tray.</li>
    <li> These fit my old Sally Hansen eye lash curler. They have a rounded top. They seem to be rubberish and not silicone. They don&#x27;t last that long, each one maybe lasts a month before a groove starts wearing in them. But I like them better than buying a new eye lash curler, that drives me crazy!! Hope to find ones that last a little longer, but these work for now. They measure about 1 1/4 inches wide and about an 1/8 of an inch thick and tall.</li>
    <li> length is correct, wish that I could find something thick wise that would fit most USA made eyelash curlers, versus this China made brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy. I was in no hurry for them so I didn&#x27;t mind the wait. When I need more I hope they are still available.</li>
    <li> These didnt fit in any eyelash curler. Waste of money</li>
