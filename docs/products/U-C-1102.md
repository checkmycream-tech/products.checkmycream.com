      <li>and i&#x27;ve tried many brands....</li>
      <li>I bought the Sally Hansen Salon Effect nail strips (awesome product, by the way) and took my friends advice to use top coat afterwards to make the strips last longer.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product, since it was quite an annoyance to have to do my nails so often.  </li>

      <li>Would give this Sally Hansen Acrylic Top Coat zero stars if I could.  </li>
      <li>docent chip, more so it &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; and shatters upon contact.</li>
      <li>This top coat is just ok.</li>
      <li>Stay away from this top coat.</li>
      <li>Okay, so I bought this on a whim at Rite Aid</li>
      <li>although, I am not even sure it deserves that.</li>
      <li>I bought a top coat</li>
      <li>I have used many of them.</li>
      <li>nails that were not painted with a top coat lasted many days.</li>
      <li>I needed a not chip top coat for my nails.</li>
      <li>One of the best, in my opinion would be Creative Nail&#x27;s Super Shiny High Gloss Top Coat.</li>
      <li>It looks sooo good right</li>
      <li>I was very excited when I saw this on the shelf</li>
      <li>The top coat makes it super shiny and it looks great when it is first done</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been working great so far.  </li>
      <li>This top coat is straight GARBAGE!!!</li>
      <li>It applies well and dries fast, it&#x27;s super shiny and creates a great acrylic nail effect.</li>
      <li>painted my nails and within 5 minutes full on chipping!</li>
      <li>I am going with the OPI top coat, much more worth it.</li>
      <li>I bought it thinking it would prevent my polish from chipping so easily.</li>
      <li>I thought it&#x27;d be a great time to put on the top coat finally yesterday morning.</li>
      <li>The No Chip top coat really keeps my nails nice and</li>
      <li>When I first applied this top coat, I was really excited because it looked AMAZING -</li>
      <li>As Nails Nail Enamel With Nylon, Natural, 0.45 oz]] for years with great success as a top coat.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Sally Hansen Nail Colour which is easily applied and lasts for up to 6 days.  </li>
      <li>I did my nails before bedtime and they looked fine.</li>
      <li>they could just fix this one small issue, this would be a perfect top coat.</li>
      <li>This is surprising for such a good company with other great products.</li>
      <li>Looks great when first applied and dries really quickly but certainly doesn&#x27;t do what it says on the bottle!</li>
      <li>For some reason I decided to look up this top coat to see reviews before I put it on and WOW am I glad I did!</li>
      <li>I honestly think this is a wonderful product and am MINDBLOWN by the poor reviews.</li>
      <li>so definitely worth the money and should be bought :)</li>
      <li>With this as a topcoat, taking care to overlap the tip a bit, my nails last for a good 7 days or more.  </li>
      <li>As the top coat, it chips right off.</li>
      <li>I bought this top coat because it says right on the packaging</li>
      <li>not even worth 5 cents!</li>
      <li>your No Chip Acrylic Top Coat really \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; me up!</li>
      <li>chip\\&quot; top coat that ruined my toe nails this whole time!</li>
      <li>Also, Revlon Color Stay Top Coat works pretty well too.  </li>
      <li>&amp; it&#x27;s not even worth one star!</li>
      <li>my nail polish (Essie) was still clean.</li>
      <li>Once it does dry, it works great though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is horrible! Within 10 hrs I have now formed cracks and bubbles! Wow ... I&#x27;m disappointed. I wish I would have read reviews before buying this crap! Save your money ladies and buy something that will live up to its name. This should be titled as \\&quot;no polish on your nails topcoat.\\&quot; -_-</li>
    <li> This product is terrible.  My polish chipped faster than it would have without any topcoat at all.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this topcoat at the drugstore when I left my other bottle of top coat (Seche Vite) at work. I love Sally Hansen products, and I&#x27;ve used the Dries Instantly top coat with no complaints at all. This one, however, was different. Quick-drying to a hard, shiny finish that began to crackle within 24 hours. Eventually it started to chip and crack right off, taking the polish with it. It also trapped little bubbles in it, no matter how hard I tried to apply it smoothly (I&#x27;m quite proud of home mani skills ... this wasn&#x27;t all user error). The bubbles went all the way down to the nail as the top coat dried, and left my dark polish with tiny flesh-colored bubbles showing through! It&#x27;s one of the very few items I&#x27;ve ever purchased that I was so disgusted with I marched right back to the store for a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same problem as everyone else! Can&#x27;t use this as a base or a top coat, because if it chips underneath my nail polish, my nail polish chips too. If it chips on top, well, you get the idea. I have like three bottles of this horrible product because I thought I kept getting expired polish, but now I see that might now be the case. Avoid wasting money on this and buy a $10 bottle of OPI base and top coat. Makes my nails last for over a week! Worth the extra $6.</li>
    <li> This has been a time a money waster! I&#x27;ve tried it several times and every time it chips my nail polish within the same day. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I use this as soon as I get home home from the nail salon and it keeps my polish from chipping, peeling or cracking for 3 weeks (until I go back for a fill-in). My nails are rock hard, super glossy and beautiful. I have used many other top coats and have never gotten results like I do from the acrylic top coat.</li>
    <li> I practically bought this because my Orly nail polish chips fast, unfortunately after two days my nails were all chipped at the tips, even worse than if I had not applied this top coat. Seriously?? did they test this product before launching it??</li>
    <li> Awful!!!! I was very excited when I saw this on the shelf I have always used \\&quot;Sally Hansen Advanced Hard As Nails with nylon and retinol\\&quot; and I thought that a polish with acrylic would last even longer.  I was very wrong.  The first time I applied it it chipped within hours and so I thought I just didn&#x27;t put enough on.  So this last time I applied this polish before AND after my colored polish and it chipped within minutes of drying.  I am so upset that this didn&#x27;t work like I had hoped but I purchased it at Walmart and I am sure they will take it back.  While I am there I will buy the \\&quot;Sally Hansen Advanced Hard as Nails with nylon and retinol\\&quot; that I have always used.  With the second polish my polish would last at least 4 days with minor chips in the corners from MODERATE activity.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to post a picture of my poor nail polish that lasted minutes with LIGHT activity.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT ANYWHERE!!! IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, THIS POLISH HAD A VERY STRONG SMELL THAT MADE ME SICK TO MY STOMACH, THE OTHER POLISH DOES NOT :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE MORE THING, IT TOOK ME A GOOD 10-15 MINUTES TO REMOVE MY POLISH!!</li>
    <li> When I first applied this top coat, I was really excited because it looked AMAZING - my nails were incredibly shiny and looked indestructible.  Unfortunately, the next morning I woke up to find that much of my nail color had already flaked off.  That day at work, the flaking got worse and worse, and I had to remove my nail polish that night because it looked so bad.  Even worse, it took FOREVER to remove with nail polish remover.  Sally Hansen usually makes great products, but this one is a dud.</li>
    <li> i wish i read these reviews before buying it from the drugstore. i mean, who doesnt love a glossy acrylic finish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS. Sally Hanson must be crazy to even put this on the market. it chips, cracks, peels, everything you wish to avoid. yes it looks nice and glossy, but this products sucks. period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely go for manis and pedis because its such a luxury, and i wanted to preserve whatever i paid for, but now my nails are ruined!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very, very angry.</li>
    <li> It made my nail polish chip! I thought that the polish was crappy because it chipped the same day! I reapplied color and \\&quot;no chip\\&quot; and it was worse. I had to take it all off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the same polish with Nailtiques 2 Plus, and I held up to TWO WEEKS!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product trusting the name of course, I have bought Sally Hansen products before with no issues but this has to be the worst top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It is tough to apply because of how sticky it is and after it begins to dry there are bubbles forming under the top coat! It&#x27;s horrible after spending time trying to perfectly do my nails. As well as the bubbles, within 24 hours the coat cracks and causes the nail polish to come off with it. It is definitely not a \\&quot;no chip\\&quot; top coat. DO NOT waste your money and buy this product or you will have to re-do your nails the next day. I am going with the OPI top coat, much more worth it.</li>
    <li> Chips within hours of putting it on. I used it as a topcoat and within a few hours my nails were cracked and chipped. I used it the next day by itself and it chipped within an hour of putting it on. It dries quick and is really thick and shiny, but it chips like crazy and causes polish to chip worse than it would without a top coat. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this product and trying it multiple times. I&#x27;m upset I wasted my time only for the polish to peel off within hours. I have never used a top coat this bad. Sally Hansen should pull this product and go back to the drawing board!</li>
    <li> I got this because a few of my nail polishes chip easily, especially during/after a shower. I bought it thinking it would prevent my polish from chipping so easily. I put it on and it was fine but after drying there were cracks in different spots on my nails from the No Chip. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> This top coat is horrible. I waited until my nail color dried completely -- an hour after I applied. The nail polish by itself chips less than when you put on this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product. They might as well discontinue it.</li>
    <li> The previous reviews are correct. When they say no chips, they must have been confused. This not only doesn&#x27;t help reduce chips, it accelerates the process of your manicure chipping and peeling off! Within minutes my polish was flaking off. Even by itself it cracks and chips, as a base coat, as a top coat, you name it! I can tell where I tried to repair my nails with only the color polish, because that stays on. The rest just flakes right off. They should market this as a nail polish remover, not a top coat.</li>
    <li> What a joke! wish could get my money back plus some for the aggravation.They should remove the NO Chip from the label</li>
    <li> Truly the worst nail product ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used top coats that didn&#x27;t seem to do much to keep my polish looking good, but this is the first one that has ever actively destroyed my manicure within hours of applying it. It goes on smooth and dries to an incredible shine... And then the next time you glance at your hands, the surface of the polish is crazed like a broken window. Within six hours of applying this, the majority of my manicure flaked off (not picked off, mind you- flaked off, just going about my day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it with several other brands of polish to see if it was an unusual reaction between two products- nope. High end polishes, low end polishes, even other Sally Hansen products- this is an equal-opportunity nail polish ruiner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would unquestionably be better off using no top coat at all than this disaster of a product. Not recommended, at all. One of the worst cosmetic products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> My polish chiped the same day! Much faster than if I had used no top coat at all. I even tried just this polish by itself and same thing- chipped and peeled within 12 hours. I tried filing &amp; buffing, made sure I washed my hands to remove oils before polishing- nothing worked. It just chipped and peeled right off. This was a waste of money, only use now is to stop runs in pantyhoes. Do not waste your money. The Diamond Strength nail color works much better, usually lasts 7-10 days with no chipping and does not need a top coat.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous top coats, and this one is excellent. It gives the nails a very hard, slick, shiny finish and extends the life of your manicure. If you don&#x27;t prep your nails correctly, and if you apply too many coats of polish without sufficient drying time between them, it doesnt matter what top coat you use because your manicure will not last. One coat of this product seems to be sufficient, and it works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to protect my nail polish from chipping and it did everything but that. One some nails, the polish peeled all the way off, on other nails, there was chipping at the tips and with other nails, there was even chipping along my cuticles. I&#x27;m so disappointed with Sally Hansen&#x27;s No Chip Acrylic Top Coat. I don&#x27;t recommend this product; it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this polish &#x27;cause of the no chip future.....well big mistake, i painted my nails this morning and tonight when i was washing lit&#x27; bit of dishes, most of it came off....never seen that before and i&#x27;ve tried many brands....horrible, horrible, horrible...they should discontinue this product.....</li>
    <li> First of all, don&#x27;t use this as a base coat. I did it on accident and it feathered my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used this product I used a regular Sally base coat, two coats of Sally polish, and this top coat. I got chips after only a few hours. Also, this top coat made the polish look weird... like it had dots in it/discoloration... it&#x27;s hard to explain but it seemed like the chemicals in the two Sally products were at war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third time, I used a Maybelline polish and I didn&#x27;t get any weird dots or discoloration. This polish makes a nice shiny top coat, but this is supposed to be a NO CHIP polish. Doesn&#x27;t work. I got chips in less than 12 hours. I was careful to really get the edges of my nails, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be happy to find something that gave me two days of pretty nails!</li>
    <li> I used this alone over clean, dry nails the night before a wedding. (I didn&#x27;t have a polish color that matched my dress so I decided to go clear.) The next morning I showered, washed my hair, and applied my makeup. I was rushing to get out the door so didn&#x27;t really look at my nails - I thought maybe I just some rough edges and needed to run the emery board over them. When I got in the car I realized that the lower half of the polish on each nail had peeled off. Thankfully, I had enough Mystic Nails with me to apply a quick coat on top to keep them smooth(ish). My nails looked awful and I had no problem telling everyone why, and what product to avoid. I had thrown out the receipt so couldn&#x27;t return it - I binned it, instead. I would give this product a negative 5 stars if the site would let me. Not only is it a waste of your money, it&#x27;s a waste of your time and polish job underneath. I would never have tried this product if Mystic Nails hadn&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Like many of the negative reviews here, i at first experinced the same thing, chipping, peeling, shattering. The trick to this top coat is you have to let your nails completly dry before applying. I for one dont really have the patience for this, but if you can deal with that process you can have the results that the top coat promises.</li>
    <li> The chipping is pretty bad, but worst is that after I did my nails and went to bed and the next day the polish had pulled back from my nail base so my nails look really bad. It is also stringy and chips very fast.</li>
    <li> I painted my nails this morning at 10, by 3pm my nails showed cracks and it&#x27;s already starting to chip. Worst top coat I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Not as no chip as I expected. It&#x27;s no chip for about two days</li>
    <li> Such a waste of money. Painted my nails. 30 minutes after they were dry, they started cracking and flaking off. Not even little chips, just huge pieces of polish coming off. Its terrible.</li>
    <li> I have never written any reviews before but thought I should write one regarding this product.  It is an absolute waste of money.  I usually use Revlon but for some reason none of Boots that are nearby store it anymore, so I went for Sally Hansen.  I am utterly disappointed and almost angry as this product is not just average, it is actually bad - my nail polish peeled off by the end of the day.  I thought it may be the quality of the nail polish, so tried another brand, still same result - chipped by the end of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short - don&#x27;t buy this product, the worst anti chip I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> Polish chipped immediately. This is surprising for such a good company with other great products. They really dropped the ball with this one. Sally what happened?</li>
    <li> Bought it from the store. When I used it and let it dry about half the day through my nail polish started peeling off. I tried it again with a different nail polish color, and it did the same thing again. Threw it in the trash, this stuff is no good, I wish I looked at the reviews online before I spent my money.</li>
    <li> Ok so I love Sally Hensen Products it&#x27;s my go to brand when it comes to my nails but this is the worst product I&#x27;ve come upon. 2 hours after I did my nails They looked like a broken mirror.</li>
    <li> The other reviews are dead on!! Don&#x27;t buy this stuff unless you like the chipped polish look. It looks sooo good right after you apply then an hour later it&#x27;s half gone.</li>
    <li> The other night I used this \\&quot;no chip\\&quot; top coat over a really cute (and time consuming) design I never did before on my toes. I was SO amazed at how SHINY and NICE they looked after they were done! It looked like I got them done at a salon! The next day (not even 24hrs later) I was out and noticed a big chunk chipped right where a rhinestone was! I was SO upset after all the work I did to them and how long it took me! It was chipping off in hard glass like pieces! I came home and took it all off and used a different nail color polish because I thought the new color polish I used was the cause of all this since it was very thin and had to be layered a million times. So I used a different color polish and same design:) I was actually going to use the same \\&quot;no chip\\&quot; top coat again since I didn&#x27;t know it caused the chipping and was so shiny and pretty! But I figured I&#x27;d wait till the next day so my nails could fully dry over night. For some reason I decided to look up this top coat to see reviews before I put it on and WOW am I glad I did! I realized it was the \\&quot;no chip\\&quot; top coat that ruined my toe nails this whole time! And I was JUST about to put it over my nicely redone nails again! Looks like I&#x27;m using another top coat! WHY does this stuff say no chip if it chips quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used?!? HOW did it ever get passed the people that test it?? I&#x27;m SO sick of products that don&#x27;t do what they&#x27;re supposed to do! It&#x27;s a shame because this top coat is the nicest glossiest clear coat I&#x27;ve ever used... And now I have to toss it because that glossy glass look only lasts under 24hrs! Boooo!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Pinterest and could not find it in the stores. Pinterest claimed that it would help protect your nails and last almost as long as a gel manicure would. WRONG! My nails chipped the next day!</li>
    <li> Chipped the same day. I even waited until the next day to apply and it still chipped. Don&#x27;t buy it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used as a topcoat. In the past I would have to refresh my nailpolish every few days because it would chip almost immediately. (No matter what brand I used).  With this as a topcoat, taking care to overlap the tip a bit, my nails last for a good 7 days or more.  I absolutely love this product, since it was quite an annoyance to have to do my nails so often.  I am just amazed that it took me so long to find it.  I have been using it for about 6 months now and I will never be without it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a fan of Sally Hansen polishes, but this top coat is horrible. It goes on extremely thick and causes the polish to dry with bubbles and not shiny at all. On top of that, it chips just as fast, if not faster, than regular polish with no top coat. Not worth the money, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I received this product really quick.  The problem I had with it was the polish cracked both times I tried to use it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the top coat from this buyer but I need to let people know that this is a piece of crap &amp; it&#x27;s not even worth one star! It made my polish chip next day, My sister bought this top coat &amp; her polish chips within 2 days, she had been using it for a month now &amp; had no idea why her polish chipped &amp; my last 2 weeks. So I decided to try it &amp; next day my nails looked horrible it cracked like paper &amp; had air bubbles this top coat needs to be discontinued!</li>
    <li> So to just go along with all the awful reviews on this product....this is TERRIBLE! I don&#x27;t care how you wanna twist, this stuff just does not work. Cracks only a few hours after applying and chips faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen. HUGE waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for probably 15 years and this is by FAR the worst top coat I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Compete garbage. I do my nails in the evening and the very next day after using this top coat, more than half of my nails are chipped. My nail polish would last longer if I didn&#x27;t even use a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy this. I will be writing a letter to the company to tell them what awful garbage this product is. Sally Hansen, I will never buy any of your products again. We&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> This top coat peels and bubbles. It is the worst top coat I have used in recent memory. I threw it away after trying to use it a few times.</li>
    <li> Ironically.... the name says &amp;#34;No chip&amp;#34;...technically I guess it mean it docent chip, more so it &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; and shatters upon contact. I used this on top of my nails and waited for it to dry, from going to my car, buckling my seat belt and driving I had already lost chunks of my nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure what this bottle can be used for, I was thinking of clear coating something perhaps that has a hairline cracks....but it would break off as soon as I were to touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternative uses...paperweight, flammable substance, or giving to some an enemy who&#x27;s nails you hate, art deco shatter affect, breakaway sealant upon contact. Stay away from this top coat. Unless you prefer the shattered and chipped nail affect.</li>
    <li> This goes on very thick and heavy, and takes forever to dry. Once it does dry, it works great though.</li>
    <li> Like right away! Bubbles, cracks and peels off in minutes. Worst product! Yes takes forever to take the rest of the mess off using nail polish remover! Crap!</li>
    <li> nails chipped within first day of application. nails that were not painted with a top coat lasted many days.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;No Chip&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s exactly what it does. It made my polish chip off that day. I even tried to use it without polish (as just a clear coat) and it was chipping within hours. Don&#x27;t waste your money; it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. It dries super slow. As the top coat, it chips right off. And as the bottom coat, it never dries.</li>
    <li> it is horrible. i don&#x27;t know what is wrong with it but i had to repaint my nails 3 days in a row. It causes the paint to crack and come off in chunks. DO NOT BUY!!!!!! I am not being dramatic or anything but it is really bad.</li>
    <li> Not shiny at all and it actually chipped off very quickly. So this only gets one star from me, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This top coat is just ok. It gives a nice, shiny finish but is hardly no-chip.</li>
    <li> This to coat looks amazing.... for the first few hours. First I used it over a Sally Hansen nail polish. It looked great, shiny, hard, like I got my nails done at a salon with Shellac. I let the polish dry for a 6 hour movie marathon before bed. The next day, I had cracks in my nail polish. I thought it might have been the nail polish (my favorite color that had since been discontinued, so it was a bit old) I gave it another try a week later with my better polishes. Used Orly bonder basecoat, then Opi polish, then this topcoat. It looked amazing again, like Shellac. Again, I let it dry for 5 hours before bed. Next day, cracks AGAIN! I even did a test with my older discontinued Sally Hansen polish and the same process with my Opi and Orly polishes with a different topcoat, no cracks after 3 days for each. The only time I had cracks were with this topcoat. Do NOT waste your money or time using this.</li>
    <li> This is probably the worst top coat I have ever used. The longest it ever lasted for me was two days before it started peeling. I even did a test with several different polish colors and brands. My polish lasted only one to two days with this top coat and over five days with nothing at all protecting the nail. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this horrible product. There are plenty of other great options out there.</li>
    <li> This is crap crap crap crap. I can&#x27;t believe they are still selling this, I&#x27;m depositing it straight into the trash can! It peels right off the nail in a day and takes the polish with it. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it for several weeks now. No matter what I do or what polish I use it with it cracks and chips. Actually makes your polish last a shorter time.</li>
    <li> The worst ever! Went on nicely but was chipping in less than 24 hours.  Actually made the polish underneath not last as long as it usually does.  This product is completely deceptive.  Call Sally and demand a full refund: 1-800-953-5080</li>
    <li> FIRST OF ALL SALLY HANSEN&#x27;S PRODUCTS ARE ALWAYS A GOOD PRODUCT AND WITH THIS DEAL, A KILLER BUY!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.  It leaves nails bumpy and bubbly and chips off within a day or two.  I&#x27;ve had great results with every other Sally Hansen product I&#x27;ve ever used, but this one is not up to their usual standards of performance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with Sally Hansen Hard as Wraps attempting DIY Gel Nails. If I could give this product zero stars I would. It looks beautiful for the first hour. Then it dries! Nail polish started immediately cracking and then just peeled off. My manicure didnt even last 24 hours. I used it twice with the same results both times using OPI and Essie color. This is an absolute rip-off. DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> I love this no chip polish!! I have never found something that makes my nails look like i just got them done at the salon. It is very shiny and smooth upon application! This product reminds me of getting the shellac done to my nails! It feels like gel when I put the product on and is very thick and makes my nails feel very strong. It stays on my nails for a long time and I do a lot of outside work! I love it!</li>
    <li> There are a few things I really love about this topcoat (and as a cosmetologist, I&#x27;ve worked with more than a few topcoats). It applies well and dries fast, it&#x27;s super shiny and creates a great acrylic nail effect. If you like the acrylic nail look but don&#x27;t want to actually have false nails then this product works well. I&#x27;ve been using it over my French manicure done with Essie polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as many other reviews on this product have mentioned, this top coat has a problem with cracking. It seems to be almost too acrylic-like, and thus very brittle. It does not chip, as promised, but after a few days your polish will be so crackled - just like when furniture has that fancy antiqued crackle effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it does best when you apply one single thin coat, it will last a few days and will be very tough &amp; shiny. As your nail flexes and experiences normal wear, however, just know in advance this top coat will crack. Additional coats, in my experience, only have made the cracking worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they could just fix this one small issue, this would be a perfect top coat. Unfortunately because of the cracking issues I have to say there are better top coats out there. One of the best, in my opinion would be Creative Nail&#x27;s Super Shiny High Gloss Top Coat.</li>
    <li> This top coat is horrible. In my experience it doesn&#x27;t always apply evenly and chips within a day. I&#x27;ve even had it start horribly chipping within 2 hours of application. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Lasts 5 minutes if you&#x27;re lucky. Cracks almost immediately. It actually takes much longer to apply and dry than it lasts/looks nice. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> i mean its been two days since i painted my nails with this top coat and there hasn&#x27;t been any chipping YET. however, after i applied this top coat the final result was my freshly painted manicure ruined with air bubbles. ugh u_u ill try again tomorrow</li>
    <li> I wish there was a tab to post some pictures. This product is a huge waste of money. It leaves your nails cracked, chipped, bubbled, flaked and yellowish tone. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I bought this on a whim at Rite Aid cause I needed a top coat and this sounded good. NO NO NO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I did let my nails dry completely. The first time for 2 hours (started chipping), the second for one day (cracked and chipping after a few hours), and most recently for TWO DAYS. Two days of drying, and since my job is minimal labor my nail polish (Essie) was still clean. I thought it&#x27;d be a great time to put on the top coat finally yesterday morning. After a few hours, already cracking, just like the previous applications. I should have just left it as it was, and now I&#x27;m left with a manicure that will peel off any moment now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff slathers on thick and sticky. Impossible to make thin, and ALWAYS cracks no matter how long you dry your color. Sally Hansen needs to fix this product or remove it!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and it works great.Thank you! It does keep your nails stronger. I use it as a base coat and a top coat. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this top coat because it says right on the packaging \\&quot;no chip\\&quot;.  I put it on before bedtime and made sure it dried completely before I went to sleep.  After I woke up I folded the laundry and three nails on my non-dominant hand had the polish chipped off halfway down the nail!  50% of the nail was uncovered!  From folding soft fluffy towels! I had to write a review to warn others.  A coworker recommended something called Pro FX Complete 3. It&#x27;s a base coat, strengthener, and top coat in one.  It&#x27;s been working great so far.  Also, Revlon Color Stay Top Coat works pretty well too.  Would give this Sally Hansen Acrylic Top Coat zero stars if I could.  I generally like their products, too.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Sally Hansen Nail Colour which is easily applied and lasts for up to 6 days.  When I saw this product, I thought it could only prolong the life of my nail varnish even further.  I was wrong!!  Within 24 hours of application I had to redo 2 nails and the rest soon followed.  Lasted only 3 days!  Looks great when first applied and dries really quickly but certainly doesn&#x27;t do what it says on the bottle!</li>
    <li> After reading the horrible reviews prior, I really wanted this product to work out for me (since I already bought it). Buuuuttt... alas, ladies believe all of the 1 star comments because they are true!! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This top coat is beautiful upon first application.  It dries fairly quickly and it makes your nails really shiny and glossy like polished glass.  The creators of this coat apparently wanted it to act like glass too! The No Chip Acrylic Top Coat SHATTERS just like glass!  I mean it really does ...forming many tiny cracks on your nails.  Once the cracks have formed, the peices begin to fall...And then, ladies, what you have after that is the demise of your beautiful freshly done manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I JUST did my nails and after a couple of hours of simple tasks like typing and washing my hands, my polish is starting to look like it&#x27;s taking the shape of continents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations, Sally... your No Chip Acrylic Top Coat really \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; me up!</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen No Chip Acrylic Top Coat is definitely the worst Hansen product I&#x27;ve tried and may be the worst nail product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am on my third application, shaking the bottle gently and applying -- once on nude clean nails and twice over nail polish.  In each instance, the No Chip cracked and flaked in one day.  I used polish remover and tried again. I&#x27;m finally doing what I haven&#x27;t done before...I&#x27;m taking this stuff back to the store and politely asking for a refund.  I think if more ladies do this, instead of feeling ashamed at buying a useless product, we would end up with better products (money talks, girls)!</li>
    <li> I guess there is some truth to their advertising. My nail polish does not \\&quot;chip\\&quot;, instead it peels off as one whole layer! I bought the Sally Hansen Salon Effect nail strips (awesome product, by the way) and took my friends advice to use top coat afterwards to make the strips last longer. Well I made the mistake of using SH No Chip top coat and within 10 minutes the sides of the strips started peeling away from my nails! On every finger! I&#x27;m so frustrated that I spent so much time getting my nails looking perfect and then this stupid top coat ruined it with a few minutes. I also used this top coat on my toes which just had plain nail polish on them and while the effect wasn&#x27;t as bad as with the nail strips, I can still see the polish coming away at the edges on most toes. Extremely dissapointing.</li>
    <li> I thought it was just me, but no, these reviews are correct. This \\&quot;no chip\\&quot; top coat makes my nail polish FALL OFF within 12 hours. Horrible horrible horrible. I used it as a base coat first, and had the same result. No matter how you apply it, it simply doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of time!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using this wrong it it STILL chips my nails! Some of my nails would stay in tact but some of them would crack the SAME day! It cracks like glass too within the same day then it starts to chip off soon after. And it chips quicker with it on then without it! Maybe I&#x27;m putting it on too quick or too heavy I dunno but I&#x27;m gonna work with it till bottle is empty but I&#x27;m NEVER buying again. Smh&lt;br /&gt;******UPDATE******&lt;br /&gt;It works BEST if you wait till nails are COMPLETELY dry! I waited till the next day to put this on and it actually worked that way. It should give better instructions or something. I&#x27;m upping it to 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Within a few short hours my polish was peeling off my nails in huge chunks.  I tried a different brand of polish to see if the problem was the color...nope!  Same story!!!  What a complete waste!!</li>
    <li> Huge disappointment. The name is extremely misleading... The nail polish chips less without this product than with it.</li>
    <li> worst worst product ever! painted my nails and within 5 minutes full on chipping! couldnt work out what was happening so re painted nails threee times (with different colors) in a row over three days....total waste to my time...NEVER again</li>
    <li> If I could give this product zero stars I would, but I have to settle with one. I needed a not chip top coat for my nails. Sally Hansen has always been a great brand for me, so I thought it would be a great product. However, it did the complete opposite. It caused my nail polish to crack and chip within a day of wear. I could peel/chip the nail polish off within hours of drying. I had better luck keeping my nail polish on without using this top coat! It was worth a try, but I found a top coat that beats this completely and is a dollar cheaper. Not a great product at all so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love the Sally Hanson products, and have used them for years. Unfortunately, this product not only begins to chip and flake within hours, it is poorly named \\&quot;No Chip\\&quot;! I told my daughter that it should be named \\&quot;Chip\\&quot;, because that is exactly what will happen if you put this on your nails. I have used the \\&quot;Advanced Hard as Nails\\&quot;  [[ASIN:B004KRX8K8 Sally Hansen Advanced Hard As Nails Nail Enamel With Nylon, Natural, 0.45 oz]] for years with great success as a top coat. Unfortunately, I purchased the \\&quot;No Chip\\&quot;, because my local retailer was out of stock on the \\&quot;Advanced Hard as Nails\\&quot; product. (Likely because it is such a superior product!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and leave this product at the store. And, give the manufacturer, Coty some feedback about \\&quot;No Chip\\&quot; here: [...]</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed a product online, but I must let you know...this product is useless. Manicure cracked and chipped within hours. I can&#x27;t believe it is still on the market.</li>
    <li> This product does THE EXACT OPPOSITE of what it advertises. I try it again and again because I hate wasting anything but my nail polish has never made it whole to day two...I think I am just gonna toss it.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this at Walmart and was looking it up curious if everyone else had the same issues I did... and I was right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut, filed, buffed my nails then applied ONLY this product yesterday to them and it looked great at first so i held my hands out as to not touch anything and had to awkwardly use my forearm and whatnot to put my covers on to go to sleep for the day as I work nights... woke up only about 3 hours later in the same position as I started, with my hands sticking out not touching anything, and every single nail&#x27;s polish was shattered and some had even fallen off with just gravity.  It was crazy!  I thought \\&quot;maybe it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t put another polish underneath it\\&quot; or the fact that I buffed the nails like they always do at the salon so maybe it left some micro abrasions on my nail that made the polish do that, but after all of these reviews where people did put a polish under... i think not.  It is just a crappy product.  I know they make some (purposefully) crackle polishes.... perhaps they got their formulas mixed up!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is so bad I felt I needed to warn others. What the other reviewers said about cracking and shattering polish is true. In less than a day, your manicure is ruined because most of the polish has flaked off. I didn&#x27;t get this off Amazon, I purchased at a local superstore... too bad I didn&#x27;t check these reviews first. This top coat is straight GARBAGE!!! Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> Horrible product! Chipped the same day. I&#x27;m upset I paid almost $5 for it, not even worth 5 cents! Goin in the garbage :(</li>
    <li> Love the shine and quick dry that this top coat offers...but it does indeed shatter like glass on my manicures. I saw another review that suggested it works better if the top coat is applied after the color coat has dried and cured, but that makes a manicure a two day process. Day 1: base and color before bed. Day 2: top coat and wet nails before work?  I&#x27;ve used half a bottle before realizing the shatter issue simply because I was applying it to nails someone else did the day before.  I&#x27;m going to try it that way, but it sucks that the product requires that.  Have to say though, the shine is unbeatable, and when I&#x27;ve added it over already dry salon manicures, rather than ones I do all at once at home, it has been great.</li>
    <li> Used three times with Essie, OPI, and Revlon polishes, on clean nails over base coat and two coats of color and plenty of drying time in between.&lt;br /&gt;Hours after application, strange cracks and stress marks formed in the polish and chipping and peeling occurred overnight.&lt;br /&gt;This really needs to be taken off the market...</li>
    <li> I thought this would help my nail polish not chip, but upon using this product, my nail polish chipped just as fast, if not faster, than if I hadn&#x27;t used it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the afternoon, and by that evening my nail polish had chips in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add- less than 24 hours after applying this product, the nail polish appears to have shatter marks in it, and it&#x27;s peeling off in large sections.  Definitely worse than if I didn&#x27;t have this top coat on at all.</li>
    <li> I LOVE sally hansen polishes, but this one sucks! I have done two thin coats of polish, both dried completely, topped it with this top coat, and my nails literally chipped in less than 12 hours, and my job is really easy on my nails! Do not waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> This is just OK.  Nothing to write home about.  I noticed chips the next day - so it&#x27;s no different or worse than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  The seller was awesome and shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> This is the worst top coat.  &amp;#34;No Chip&amp;#34; should be more like &amp;#34;All Chip&amp;#34;.  Ruins my nail color within the day.  It&#x27;ll crack and chip horribly.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I Hate it..  i bought it and did not pay attention to the reviews... mistake.. wasted my money...0 STARS!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star, quite honestly it&#x27;s the worst top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! Every single one of my nails chipped within 12 hours of application, and this was with a good base coat and polish. Avoid!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product over nail polish and on bare nails. Either way it is awful. My nail polish chipped faster when using this product than with no product at all. I would recommend the NYC brand. It&#x27;s much cheaper and seems to help my nail polish stay on.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the hope that I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with chipping nail polish after doing dishes or even just typing. I enjoy painting my own nails and don&#x27;t normally pay to get them done, so I realize that my own manicures may not last as long. However, this is the best example of false advertising (worse than Maybelline&#x27;s Falsies!). My nails chipped the SAME day I used this top coat. I now use OPI base and top coat along with the Drip Dri drops. And they last for at least a week and DO NOT chip. I constantly have my hands in water so I have put these to the test---&gt; they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***LADIES, PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTER YOUR MONEY.****</li>
    <li> This product has ruined at least 3 perfect home manicures I did.  I bought a top coat so my nails wouldn&#x27;t chip within a few days.  I certainly got what I paid for, because my polish gets weird visible cracks within HOURS of application, and then simply flakes and peels off in giant strips.  I&#x27;ve never seen the effect that this product had on my polish.  If not for the fact that it peeled away 3-4 different brands of polish (Revlon, Essie, NYC, and sinful), I would&#x27;ve just assumed it was the quality of the polish itself.  Luckily I reused an older color that I had used before with success, and was able to determine that this was the problem.  Would give it negative stars if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shockingly, does not have the same effect on toes.  Not sure why.</li>
    <li> I do not understand why it is labeled as &amp;#34;no chip&amp;#34;. My nails chip more than they did without using it.</li>
    <li> Awful product. This top coat chipped my polish in less than a day on my pedicure. Typically my pedicure doesn&#x27;t chip in well over a week. The top coat makes it super shiny and it looks great when it is first done but then cracks it in less than a day. I tried this several times to make sure it just wasn&#x27;t a fluke but nope...chips every time within the day. Very frustrating so please buy something else. This top coat stinks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see so many negative reviews about this product, as it works extremely well for me. I use No Chip on my toes on top of two coats of SH Salon Complete polish, and the pedicure lasts until I have to redo it because of growth of the nails. On my hands, it is the final layer on top of Orly Bonder base coat, two coats of SH Hard as Nails Xtreme Wear polish, and one coat of Orly Sec-n-Dry top coat. My manicure usually lasts five days before the first chip and a full week until I need to take it off! Yes, this whole process takes about 90 minutes, but it&#x27;s worth it. The No Chip top coat really keeps my nails nice and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the problem that people are having is not letting their polish dry completely before applying the No Chip; the drying top coat I use really dries everything up before I use the No Chip. Other than making sure that the polish is dry, advice I can offer is to be careful when applying the No Chip. It takes some practice, but for me it seems to be best to have just enough product on the brush to make one even stroke on the nail before going back into the bottle, covering each nail in 2-3 strokes. This method eliminated the bubbles for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! I used to never paint my nails because it would chip really badly in 1-2 days, but now I can do my nails just once a week and not have to worry about it looking awful right away.</li>
    <li> As my title says, I should have known better than to purchase on a whim. I usually don&#x27;t do my nails because of my jobs, but decided to be girly for once and attempt a manicure. I suppose I did pretty good with three days before it chipped, but it cracked all over the nail before doing so - making my polish look like drying mud under the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I retried (thinking it was my ineptitude and lack of experience) after watching several DIY manicures - I trimmed, buffed, filed, removed all oils from my nail bed - even bought drying drops. And same thing happened. Cracks, then chips and within the same day, or next day. I tossed it in the trash and ordered Essie&#x27;s Good to Go top coat. At least that one seems to have a decent rating.</li>
    <li> great and amazing, works and dries supper fast, my girlfriend loves it :D so definitely worth the money and should be bought :)</li>
    <li> How is it called no chip when it chips and peels off? Messed up my design n everything smh ugh</li>
    <li> Within a few short hours my polish was peeling off my nails in huge chunks.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work for me do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time last night.  After I made my coffee and fed my dogs it had chipped on two nails this morning .  Without it, my nails would have been fine for at least a couple of days.  This product makes nail chipping 100% worse.  A complete waste of money - don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a new topcoat and decided to give this a try. Worst idea ever. Used it as a base coat and a top coat for my OPI polish. Peeled the entire manicure off in THREE HOURS. Tried it as a top coat on Ulta brand plain white tips. Shattered the polish underneath and chipped off within two days. Absolutely terrible, and after multiple attempted tries, I&#x27;ll be throwing it in my nylon drawer to use exclusively to stop runs.</li>
    <li> Do not buy! The worst top coat ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this chips easily, it makes nails brittle and they chip as well. Awful product.</li>
    <li> I do my own glitter toe nails and have always had them last 3 or 4 weeks. I ran out of clear top coat and figured I&#x27;d give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;Nope, horrible choice.&lt;br /&gt;Two days later my nails are completely chipped and most of the polish/glitter is gone!  There were flakes all over my socks.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it. Spend a little bit more money and get something that will last.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a department store: WORST TOP COAT EVER. After you used it over other color or just the top coat, once it&#x27;s dry it starts breaking the polish. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get what all of these one star reviews are about! I love this stuff! Sure, it&#x27;s not like acrylic nails you would get at the nail salon, but what do you expect for less than 5 bucks?! The top coat makes nails last way longer than they normally would without a topcoat. I honestly think this is a wonderful product and am MINDBLOWN by the poor reviews. With all due respect, you guys are way too high maintenance!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s seriously like this top coat never dries. 17 hours after application I can still smudge it around and pick it off like it&#x27;s only an hour old. What a waste of money. I&#x27;m throwing away the rest that I have, I&#x27;m not even going to try to use it. Tried it twice and got the same results both times. No good!</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst products I have ever used. Just like everyone says it peels off like crazy. At first I thought it was just my nails, but nope it seems to be a common problem with everyone. It is completely useless to even use this product. It makes me wonder if they even tested this product before launching it. I mean seriously why is this even on the market. It reminds me of the peel off nail polish I would wear as a kid. Im giving it one star although, I am not even sure it deserves that.</li>
    <li> So relieved to see the negative reviews- I thought I had somehow used nailpolish incorrectly. Nope. This stuff just cracks into a million flakes in less than 24 hours. I&#x27;ve tried it with various brands of polish, one coat or two, a Sally Hansen base coat. No matter what I do, my polish is ruined in less than a day when it crackle/ shatters- not even tiny chips- whole sections just flake off taking the polish with them. The only thing this stuff is good for is giving you an excuse to give yourself a new manicure every single day- twice a day if you start early. Never again.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen products are often good. I have used many of them. This is certainly not one of them. I have never seen anything like it! I did my nails before bedtime and they looked fine. The next morning, I saw cracks in spots. Not good, but ok, I proceeded with my day. Pretty soon, my nails looked like shattered ice! It&#x27;s actually indescribable. Unfortunately, all of that time wasted along with my good nail polish...all for nothing! One of the worst nail products I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Did anybody pair this with the Powerful Acrylic Gel? I think you&#x27;re supposed to pair it with that and it&#x27;s supposed to work wonders. So I&#x27;ve heard on Pinterest anyways! If anybody has tried it with both, let us know how it went!</li>
