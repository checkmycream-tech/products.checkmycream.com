### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This soap is awesome, the problem is, I can&#x27;t find it in any stores anymore.</li>
      <li>I find it perfect for Spring and Summer days.</li>
      <li>Great soap</li>
      <li>Smells great too.</li>
      <li>Who in the world thought that this would be a good idea?\\</li>
      <li>Bought this and decided to try it, loved the smell when I opened the cap.</li>
      <li>It definately shocks the senses, but not in a good way.</li>
      <li>It turns out that this has menthol in it and that does not make for a good experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the stuff!</li>
      <li>Nice smell, and hubby loves the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; on his face.</li>
      <li>I will say one positive is that it does smell good!</li>
      <li>Really does give you a very pleasant sensation all over and is accentuated in more sensual areas.</li>
      <li>Probably my favorite body wash of all time.</li>
      <li>am I glad I found this stuff.</li>
      <li>I find it refreshing and soothing.</li>
      <li>I switched to this and absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this body wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this body wash.</li>
      <li>I love this version.</li>
      <li>This just made me love it even more.</li>
      <li>It gives you a very cool and tingling sensation.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s tingling sensation really feels good</li>
      <li>Love this product but the warning not to use it immediately after shaving is good advice if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>so it was surprising that there was no negative reaction to it.</li>
      <li>This body wash always feels clean, fresh, and amazing.</li>
      <li>Hoping they keep this available for online purchasing.</li>
      <li>Somehow manufacturers keep changing their products, and when they do that a lot of the old reliable brands just aren&#x27;t as good as they used to be and/or either your skin changes.</li>
      <li>Many vendors offer for half this and will qualify for free shipping!</li>
      <li>I love Irish Spring.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does burn more than regular soap when you get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I bought a case of Irish Spring Intensity, because  I love it.</li>
      <li>But whatever it is they use to give use the cool and tingling sensation, caused me to feel a burning sensation on my, well, very sensitive reigon.</li>
      <li>I grabbed a bottle of this recently when it was on sale and thought when I opened it that it smelled pretty strong, but what the heck, let&#x27;s lather up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I thought somebody really messed up at the factory, until I got out, put my glasses on and read the label.  </li>
      <li>There really is not any more words to say to this review</li>
      <li>but the Intensify version is that much</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I recommend washing everything else first, then the undercarriage last, right before you get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>After using it, my body starts to have a slight tingling and intense cooling sensation, which I love.</li>
      <li>In the Houston heat and humidity, this particular brand cools you off when you shower.</li>
      <li>i am just a normal guy.</li>
      <li>Ran out one morning mid-shower, so I grabbed a new bottle.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend even for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Funny - I bought this by accident, thinking that I had picked up the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Irish Spring.  </li>
      <li>I use this all the time and it is nothing like Icy Hot.</li>
      <li>Imagine putting icy hot on places where icy hot should never go</li>
      <li>I will leave the details out, but as a warning I would say avoid washing sensitive or private areas with this product.</li>
      <li>only thing I can compare it to is icy hot.  </li>
      <li>Whenever you&#x27;re a little hot &#x27;underneath&#x27;, this stuff freezes it for about 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always preferred Irish Spring, even back in my bar soap days, I originally tried the Irish Spring Original, which wasn&#x27;t bad...........</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve always preferred Irish Spring, even back in my bar soap days, I originally tried the Irish Spring Original, which wasn&#x27;t bad...........</li>
<li> This 6 pack lasts him all summer long.</li>
<li> calculated I&#x27;d save $4.93 just by subscribing through Amazon for 6 month deliveries (I use 1 bottle a month, it lasts a long time) versus buying 6 at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My facial hair is thick and my skin is very sensitive</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve written Colgate (they make it) and told them that I am amazed that it ever passed any human testing and that I would be shocked if anyone ever used this more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Slight tingling sensation, especially in your &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas.</li>
<li> The tingle isn&#x27;t bad at all, and, as a matter of fact, I find it refreshing.  </li>
<li> started using body wash a couple years ago, after being a lifelong bar soap user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Certainly not overpowering or unbearable.</li>
<li> It provides a tingling sensation that is compared to none other.</li>
<li> Am using this now in place of other products I used for years.</li>
<li> My family often tells me they can smell me down the hall after a shower, the fragrance is quite enticing.</li>
<li> /&gt;HOLY COW!  </li>
<li> could see it being uncomfortable if you had a rash somewhere, or sensitive</li>
<li> (not sure what the 1 star reviewer was talking about when he said it burned........... he might want to check with a dermatologist for an allergy condition in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Oh man this product is no good.</li>
<li> I hate that it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
<li> Awful, burning and uncomfortable  sensation.  </li>
<li> This was brutal stuff.  </li>
<li> My husband hated it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nice smell, and hubby loves the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; on his face. Says it&#x27;s the cleanest he&#x27;s felt after a shower, and he&#x27;s a welder/oil field.</li>
    <li> In the Houston heat and humidity, this particular brand cools you off when you shower. Would highly recommend even for sensitive skin. Am using this now in place of other products I used for years. Somehow manufacturers keep changing their products, and when they do that a lot of the old reliable brands just aren&#x27;t as good as they used to be and/or either your skin changes. JMHO.</li>
    <li> I grabbed a bottle of this recently when it was on sale and thought when I opened it that it smelled pretty strong, but what the heck, let&#x27;s lather up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY COW!  This was brutal stuff.  After starting to wash my unmentionables everything just started burning.  I immediately started rinsing it off, but it just kept on burning.  I stayed in the shower for an extra 15 minutes trying to get it all off and to make the pain stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can compare it to is icy hot.  Imagine putting icy hot on places where icy hot should never go and you have this soap.  It turns out that this has menthol in it and that does not make for a good experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve written Colgate (they make it) and told them that I am amazed that it ever passed any human testing and that I would be shocked if anyone ever used this more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So again, do not buy this, and if you do, don&#x27;t use it.  Learn from my mistakes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using body wash a couple years ago, after being a lifelong bar soap user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy am I glad I found this stuff. I&#x27;ve always preferred Irish Spring, even back in my bar soap days, I originally tried the Irish Spring Original, which wasn&#x27;t bad........... but the Intensify version is that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s tingling sensation really feels good (not sure what the 1 star reviewer was talking about when he said it burned........... he might want to check with a dermatologist for an allergy condition in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying these 6 packs from now on, as these retail for $3.50 a piece + sales tax (ughhh) at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I calculated I&#x27;d save $4.93 just by subscribing through Amazon for 6 month deliveries (I use 1 bottle a month, it lasts a long time) versus buying 6 at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re on the fence, I&#x27;d pull the trigger and try this stuff out. My family often tells me they can smell me down the hall after a shower, the fragrance is quite enticing.</li>
    <li> Do not buy from Shopping Gopher at 52.95 though.  Many vendors offer for half this and will qualify for free shipping! Love this product but the warning not to use it immediately after shaving is good advice if you have sensitive skin.  Really does give you a very pleasant sensation all over and is accentuated in more sensual areas.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and it is nothing like Icy Hot. I don&#x27;t find it at all \\&quot;brutal\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I could see it being uncomfortable if you had a rash somewhere, or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It does burn more than regular soap when you get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I like the sensation, it wakes me up. I love the stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. Probably my favorite body wash of all time. It provides a tingling sensation that is compared to none other.</li>
    <li> Funny - I bought this by accident, thinking that I had picked up the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Irish Spring.  Ran out one morning mid-shower, so I grabbed a new bottle.  HOLY SMOKES! I thought somebody really messed up at the factory, until I got out, put my glasses on and read the label.  I thought \\&quot;Putting menthol on your nether-regions? Who in the world thought that this would be a good idea?\\&quot;  Kept using it though.  Yup.  You guessed it.  Now I&#x27;m hooked - which probably means they&#x27;ll quit making it...</li>
    <li> This body wash always feels clean, fresh, and amazing. I buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> This is a 3-season soap. Whenever you&#x27;re a little hot &#x27;underneath&#x27;, this stuff freezes it for about 2 minutes. I recommend washing everything else first, then the undercarriage last, right before you get out of the shower. You&#x27;ll thank me later.</li>
    <li> I switched to this and absolutely love it.  The tingle isn&#x27;t bad at all, and, as a matter of fact, I find it refreshing.  Just like someone else said, it made me feel cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it immediately after shaving and found no problems. My facial hair is thick and my skin is very sensitive so it was surprising that there was no negative reaction to it.</li>
    <li> I love Irish Spring. This just made me love it even more. I find it perfect for Spring and Summer days. After using it, my body starts to have a slight tingling and intense cooling sensation, which I love. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Oh man this product is no good. It definately shocks the senses, but not in a good way. I will leave the details out, but as a warning I would say avoid washing sensitive or private areas with this product. Especially after you have shaved. I feel like it is my job to warn people about this before you endure the discomfort I felt after using this product. I will say one positive is that it does smell good!</li>
    <li> Pack of 6 lasted me 7 months.  This is my 2nd order.  Can&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Awful, burning and uncomfortable  sensation.  My husband hated it.  Never buy this.</li>
    <li> Bought this and decided to try it, loved the smell when I opened the cap. It gives you a very cool and tingling sensation. However, there is one issue I had with it. i am just a normal guy. But whatever it is they use to give use the cool and tingling sensation, caused me to feel a burning sensation on my, well, very sensitive reigon. And only there. Don&#x27;t know how to say it, but it felt like my boys were on fire. I can&#x27;t recommend it for that resason.</li>
    <li> bf kept running out so I got him a stock.</li>
    <li> I love this version. It reminds me of the feeling you get when you run an oxy pad across your face. The tingling feeling to me is very similar. I hate that it&#x27;s so hard to find. The retail stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. Great soap</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome, the problem is, I can&#x27;t find it in any stores anymore. I bought a case of Irish Spring Intensity, because  I love it. Hoping they keep this available for online purchasing. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this body wash during the summer months.  I began ordering them online when they stopped selling them in our grocery store.  This 6 pack lasts him all summer long.</li>
    <li> ...this product livens me up!  There really is not any more words to say to this review but since I have to.</li>
    <li> Slight tingling sensation, especially in your &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas. Certainly not overpowering or unbearable. I find it refreshing and soothing.</li>
