      <li>Of course, on the rare occasion that MAC does sell sets, they have SE after the number.</li>
      <li>welp i just got my brushes in i love the bag and the brushes, there soft i like them</li>
      <li>Lets be realistic, MAC brushes will never retail for so cheap.</li>
      <li>Shipping was super duper fast, the item was packaged well, and the brushes looked exactly as they do in the picture.</li>
      <li>Im hoping when they arrive the product is exactly what im expecting.</li>

      <li>If these MAC brushes are fake they work just as best as the real ones.</li>
      <li>Had these for a few months and they work amazing.</li>
      <li>These are fakes because the real brushes I have I compared them.  </li>
      <li>knew very well that what i was buying was not the real deal.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the bag it comes in either</li>

      <li>My biggest regret was not reading the reviews prior to purchasing, I got so excited when I found that I forgot to read the reviews.</li>
      <li>but I needed some new brushes and could not afford to replace my real MAC brushes at this time.</li>
      <li>The case that it came with is black and has MAC on it and it is really cute.</li>
      <li>I was able to put it back in, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my birthday and had really high hopes for this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not a MAC product. Poor quality. If you want an original MAC product then avoid this.  Not recommended</li>
    <li> Hello, I have not recieved my order yet. I ordered it around 18 Oct, and it has not arrived yet. Can you please let me know the status of my order. Thank you.</li>
    <li> i bought one set for cheap from one seller and it was shedding and brushes glue came off. The seller refunded me fullly. then I bought again from Vanitybox and this time the quality was way better. No shedding and any issues. The brushes were good quality, just what I needed. This is a great buy instead of buying each individual Mac brush. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was from this seller.</li>
    <li> Lets be realistic, MAC brushes will never retail for so cheap. One face brush is like 40 dollars what makes you think you can get this set with 12 for 45?&lt;br /&gt;I own REAL MAC brushes and believe me they have never been cheap. DO NOT BUY if you want legit MAC brushes.</li>
    <li> Pleaseeee they are obviouslly fake!  MAC never made a 12 pieces full size kit!  simple doesnt exist!  MAC kit are alwasy, I mean ALWAYS SE- special edition and travel size (and yes they are worse then regular size)  besides MAC marking the brusches with wrong number and selling cheapper??? do u really believe in it? coz if u do,sorry u should research more before buy...  they are totally fake!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter requested this Hello Kitty brush set for Christmas and so we purchased it, she is elated!!! So this has been added to her Christmas list of Hello Kitty!!! Enjoy Elana!!!</li>
    <li> First of all it&#x27;s fake. The brushes are not mac. The reason I dislike this product is because the Brushes are falling apart and hair is falling out. You can get better brushes at walmart for a better price. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.</li>
    <li> Whoever is looking to buy this....please dont. I bought this for my birthday and had really high hopes for this. When they came in I was soo excited and the product seemed nice. The case that it came with is black and has MAC on it and it is really cute. As soon as i opened it i was soo happy and the brushes felt amazing!! But the reason why i gave this 3  stars is because there are 2 brushes that say MAC 109 on them...and there different brushes. Please help i dont know if i should send them back i already used them but i dont want fake brushes...but if youre just looking for good quality brushes these are good but if you want the real thing then dont buy this.</li>
    <li> I love MAC brushes and lost one of my make up bags with a few of my MAC brushes in them so I decided to order these.  I knew they were more than likely fake but I needed some new brushes and could not afford to replace my real MAC brushes at this time. So I took my chances.  These are fakes because the real brushes I have I compared them.  They are really similar but not the same.  Although they are fake, they are good brushes.  I have washed them and haven&#x27;t had any shedding.  They are soft and sturdy as well.  If you want the real thing I advise not to buy, but if you want you are just looking for good brushes and don&#x27;t mind knock offs these are great.  They come a lot faster than I expected as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered it on Monday and I got it on Wednesday. If these MAC brushes are fake they work just as best as the real ones. 12 brushes and under $50 why not!? These brushes are great and they give you cute little make up bag</li>
    <li> Of course it&#x27;s too good to be true, they&#x27;re not real MAC brushes...BUT they are still nice brushes and I use them.  If you have a problem with owning brushes that are technically not legit, then don&#x27;t get them.  I don&#x27;t really like the bag it comes in either, it looks cheap to me, but it works for traveling so I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> So I needed to replace my old Mac brushes because I just had had them for too long and I saw these, and got them. First off they are fake. Some of the brushes say Japan and USA on the handle when Mac products are made in France!!! I&#x27;m not saying these brushes are bad, they are just fake and it&#x27;s pretty obvise. Dunno if I&#x27;m gonna return them or not</li>
    <li> I just received this item today, after ordering it a mere 3 days ago. Shipping was super duper fast, the item was packaged well, and the brushes looked exactly as they do in the picture. The faux leather case is nice - it&#x27;s a black, oblong case with the MAC logo on one side and on the zipper. There are 3 pockets for the brushes to fit in nicely, and in the center of the case is a smaller zipper pouch where you could put a few smaller odds &amp; ends, like maybe tweezers or a few smaller brushes you might have. Maybe the seller could post a picture of this case as well, because I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure what would be coming. Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as whether the brushes are real or fake - I&#x27;m going to guess they&#x27;re most likely fake. I read all the reviews before making my purchase, so I knew going in that they were likely fake, and I was ok with that as long as they were a good quality. I have two genuine MAC brushes that were given to me as a birthday gift years ago, and out of curiosity, I compared my known real MAC brushes with what I just purchased. My brushes are the 208 (angled brow brush) and the 213 (flush brush), which are numbered 263 and 214, respectively, in the new kit. The real brushes have slightly narrower and longer handles than the ones in the kit. I don&#x27;t know that one vs. the other is an advantage, really. The other thing I noticed is my real brushes say France, and these say Japan. Again - so what? I haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet, so I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;ll hold up - hopefully well. If not, I&#x27;ll update my comments. I personally can&#x27;t afford around $20 a brush, but I do really like MAC products so this is kind of a happy medium for me. Lots of women carry knockoff purses too, so in my mind this isn&#x27;t any different - again - as long as they hold up well.</li>
    <li> Just received my order today in the mail. Very happy with how fast it was shipped. Took only 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;FIRST OFF , if you clearly think that these are REAL MAC brushes? You are not a MAC fan.&lt;br /&gt;I knew very well that what i was buying was not the real deal. Clearly you&#x27;d be spending at least $150&lt;br /&gt;for a set like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag it came with is PERFECT for me. I&#x27;ve been searching for a decent group of brushes that came with a nice case with it&lt;br /&gt;for easy traveling. The brushes were in perfect condition and everything neatly grouped. All the 12 brushes came with plastic around them&lt;br /&gt;from keeping them getting ruined. The brushes themselves felt like really good quality. Well money spent in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking for FAKE name brand but good quality brushes , go for it!. I just personally don&#x27;t have $40 to spend on each brush ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all , its a great deal on a whole variety of brushes. Not real MAC, but very good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT! ALL FAKE! THE BRUSHES ARE FALLEN APART! WHEN U TOUCH THEM, THEM COME ON YOUR HANDS! GOING TO RETURN THIS ASAP! DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
    <li> welp i just got my brushes in i love the bag and the brushes, there soft i like them alot but i looked at the mac website to make  shure the right numbers were on the right brushes all of them were right except 2 were the numbered wrong, the numbers weren&#x27;t even  on the list, i mean the brushes are the same color just because there stamped with the wrong numbers dose not mean there fake , it might be why there  so cheap, but still real brushes, i don&#x27;t know but im happy with them and would buy them again. my big thing is i want brushes that don&#x27;t shed and so far so good , overall i like them .</li>
    <li> If you guys are really thinking that your buying authentic mac brushes you are wrong... they are definitely fake... mac brushes are very expensive and if they came in a set they would be even more expensive... these are no anywhere close to the quality of mac brushes... sorry</li>
    <li> Not mac to gud to be tru...they are very fake im so mad yo pense k erA the real staf</li>
    <li> The best brushes to apply makeup with. I love them. The pouch could be a bit larger! I think that MAC products are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this set of brushes! My biggest regret was not reading the reviews prior to purchasing, I got so excited when I found that I forgot to read the reviews. Within 1 week of receiving, 2 of the brushes broke. As I was washing one of the brushes, the one I was most excited about, the tip came out. I was able to put it back in, but it&#x27;s not the same. The second brush broke during the first use, the end fell off. I&#x27;m not hard on my brushes, I&#x27;ve had my old set for several years. I bought this set hopinig to replace my old set, but that&#x27;s not the case. Stay away from this and don&#x27;t buy, it&#x27;s not the same quality and not worth it!</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast on these brushes!! Im not sure if they are authentic or not due to i bought all twelve brushes for the price one mac brush usually costs but they are still fantastic quality. The free case thety sent has a broken zipper but its fine because i store them where i can see them so it wasnt a huge loss. Overall a great buy!!</li>
    <li> These are really good knockoffs. The case is WAY nicer than I expected, and even came with it&#x27;s own zippered dust cover. It has universal pockets, so it can be customized for travel, and even has a zippered pouch inside for odds and ends. Compared to the MAC brushes I have from the MAC store, they seem to be equal quality. (I will, of course, update if they start to fall apart later) For the price it can&#x27;t be beat. They are stamped Japan, which doesn&#x27;t mean much. (Or Paris, Turkey, etc. Real MAC brushes are NOT all from Paris) Of course, on the rare occasion that MAC does sell sets, they have SE after the number. These do not, and are also full sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, if paying extra for \\&quot;genuine\\&quot; brushes means a lot to you, don&#x27;t buy these. But for all I know they are made in the same factory, and simply not authorized. They really are that nice. I don&#x27;t need to pay 10X as much for MAC to tell me I have a good product. I can tell that myself. I&#x27;m taking off a star for their lack of honesty, not because of the quality of the brushes.</li>
    <li> I have just received today the shipped product. The only truth in this product described is the \\&quot;faux\\&quot; leather case and the number of brushes on which is written \\&quot;MAC\\&quot;. Thing is... it&#x27;s NOT MAC. Neither the case, nor the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed to discover that it wasn&#x27;t an amazing offer but rather a fake MAC case and fake MAC brushes. Not only they&#x27;re fake but bad quality as any lambda user could recognize that by the touch of it. BIG NO NO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supermarket brush is even better quality so don&#x27;t waste your money on that. Mojo: Focuse on quality rather than quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIG TIME DISAPPOINTMENT.</li>
    <li> Just ordered this the 8th and the expected arrival date is Nov 3. Seemed extremely cheap for 12 MAC brushes so i couldnt resist ordering them. Im hoping when they arrive the product is exactly what im expecting.</li>
    <li> When these brushes came in i was so excited that i couldn&#x27;t wait to open them. Once i opened them i grabbed my makeup and tried them out. The brushes have really great quality and they work rather well, but when you wash them they are horrible!!! They also shed A LOT when you use them. They are great knockoffs but i prefer the real MAC brushes, to be honest these are just a waste of your money, save your money and buy some real brushes!!</li>
    <li> after using them for four month several of the handles have broken off - not sure if they are real mac brush cause i&#x27;ve had store brand ones for years and this has never happened.</li>
    <li> I like it so much. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I do not own these brushes but just want to let any prospective buyers know that first of all these are fakes and MAC does not sell it&#x27;s full sized brushes in sets like this. If you are looking for quality MAC like brushes go with Sigma brand or Sonia Kashuk from Target.</li>
    <li> Had these for a few months and they work amazing. Great quality. I love how they look and feel def worth it for the price. Works as good as the higher end makeup brushes...</li>
    <li> My wife order them, she is extremly happy.  They do what they are supposed to do even if they may or may not be an original Mac product. Until today she still dosen&#x27;t really notice a difference with her other brushes. And a lot of her friends, after trying them,  have ordered more. When I bought it was an Amazon Prime item, I almost exclusively buy Amazon Prime items.</li>
    <li> MAC NEVER sells brush sets. Just individual brushes and empty bags to put your collection in. These are definitely not MAC quality, and also might be dangerous. The companies that make knock-offs don&#x27;t have health and safety regulations.</li>
    <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t truly MAC but ( obviously by the price) but they are decent brushes that lasted me a little over a year the bristles are very soft and they don&#x27;t shed. I would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Bought this knwoing that it was to good to be true, there knockoffs, not all of them are bad brushes but the ones that are bad are terrible and scrachy.</li>
    <li> Not real Mac Brushes. Knock Offs. They offered to send it back explaining that its not to Mac Quality Standard.  Purchase at your own risk.</li>
    <li> Clearly a set of knock-off brushes.</li>
    <li> Not real. Missing one brush and my powder brush does not have a real MAC number on it.  Definitely knock offs, but still pretty good brushes.</li>
